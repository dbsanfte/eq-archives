I play on E'ci also, and have for almost 5 years. I think it is a very
friendly server in general. My current main is a 65 Shaman. When I want an
LDoN group, or any group for that matter, I just put on lfg and go about my
business and I get tells to join groups pretty quickly. Being a Shaman
helps, as a good share of the pickup groups in LDoN, BoT, Tactics, etc. like
to have a Shaman in their group, but my point is that it does work, and lots
of people use it.

When I am looking for say a 65 Cleric, I type "/w all Cleric lfg 65" and
that is how I find my cleric, not just looking in the zone I want to group
in, and I'm sure that's how most others do it also. There are lots of people
looking for LDoN adventures at my level, but I'm afraid most of the level
30ish characters are twinks racing to 65 these days. There is a ldon channel
also, if you haven't tried it.
