The term "two-faced" is not harsh, it's completely ridiculous. To start 
with, EQ and EQ2 have mostly different development teams, and anyway, it 
*is* much too late to change fundamental gameplay mechanics at this 
point. No matter how good the idea, it wouldn't be a good idea to 
implement now.

To wit, removing corpse runs and xp loss in EQ would *not* be an 
improvement at this stage.
