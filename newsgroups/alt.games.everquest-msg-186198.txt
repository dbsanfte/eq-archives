What I don't like is that everyone is jumping to conclusions. Here's a
reason that I have mentioned at least once in this thread that most
everyone seems to be ignoring. I'll leave it up to you to decide if
it's valid or not: Yes, I fell down the side of the canyon in front of
Kael. That does NOT mean I fell from the maximum distance. Everyone
seems to think I did a flying leap at the maximum depth. I was NOT
hugging the zone line. Take a look at the canyon next time you're
there. It's big. It extends far out into the zone line. Notice that it
gets shallower and the slope gets gentler as you near the mouth. While
I can't give an exact /loc, I was close to the mouth of the canyon.
The damage from the distance I fell should have been at least lessened
by safe fall. I only fell for about half a second. I've seen monks
lower than me jump off the bridge in Warslisk Woods and survive, and
I'm sure it wasn't any deeper than that.

I wasn't sure what to do about it, so I asked around, and some people
suggested I report it. I also explicitly stated in my web report what
had happened, and the GM volunteered to give me a rez. I wasn't hiding
anything, I wasn't lying, and I didn't demand one. I didn't even ASK
for one. I wouldn't be telling the truth if I said I wasn't hoping for
one, though. He offered me one, and I took it. Wouldn't you? Upon
logging in to look for him a few days ago, I realized my corpse only
had 2 hours left on the rez timer, so I asked my question here. And
all of a sudden I'm an immature whiner who takes up endless amounts of
customer service time and bothers GMs because I didn't take a death I
(didn't) deserve. I'll be happy to forward the CS email to anyone that
wants it, minus the personal details.

And BTW, I don't have any troubles. I got the rez too. It took him all
of about 2 minutes to port to me, rez me, and I thanked him, and that
was it. Since my issue is resolved, and I'm tired of beating my head
against a wall, this will be the last contribution I make to this
thread.
