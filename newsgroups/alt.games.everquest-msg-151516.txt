A bard friend of mine is working on her epic, and a warrior friend has
Phinny's spine and is willing to MQ it.  Trouble is, he's KOS.

Will the MQ work if I charm the NPC for the bard (she can do it, but I have
Dictate...48 second fixed length charm)?

I don't MQ much, and never have when the other person was KOS, but I'm sure
this is common knowledge to many of you.  Will MQ work with a critter
charmed?
