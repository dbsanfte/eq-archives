ahem... as I said... any amateur rules lawyer, yada yada yada.  Yes, if it was
"Tigole" by itself, I too may have guessed Tie-Goal if asked to pronounce it.  But
it's not presented that way. It's presented in context, as "Tigole Bitties".  Are
you really going to try to make *that* much of an amatuer rules lawyer stretch as
to claim that you didn't see the intended "pun" behind that immediately?

> A spoonerism is simply not a misspelling or "alternative spelling".

/boggle.
It's two words. (albeit slang words) Both misspelled. The letters happen to be
switched. But both slang words are spelled incorrectly.  Sheesh.
<snip miles of amateur rules lawyer explanations>
As I said...... a case not worth debating. Sometimes there are such things as
"common sense" and "obvious" violations of rules, even if it's only of the *intent*
due to a failure of a game manufacturer's tech writer to think up and write down
every conceivable specific naming policy violation in existance. And again, I would
like to see it taken in front of a GM who actually read and gave a rat's ass about
the naming rules, and see what response your legal brief get's there.
  But on a final note, I ask you to rebutt the following.  I'm about to write a
word or phrase. (Ok, type, actually.) Here we go...... check it out.
mamiograme.

Ooops! I was trying to write "mammogram".  I must have *misspelled* it. But I can't
think of another word even close to that, so that would have been my guess.
Let's try another.
Bersonal Cheking Ackount

Ooops again! My bad!  Boy, I certainly am having keyboard trouble today. But even
with no context around it, can you guess what I was trying to type? Well, good.
Glad you got it, even though I *misspelled* it.

One more........... ready?
Tigole Bitties.
My, what a poor typist. I can't even spell Big Ole' Titties right.
/sigh
