You shouldn't be swapping to disk at all with that much ram.  Unless you're 
running 2 instances of EQ.

Given that you're not going to be swapping much, the only time this is 
going to help is when you're zoning.  You might shave a couple seconds off 
your load times.  I'd look at getting a single serial ATA drive.

Depending on your current video card, I'd look at upgrading that before 
upgrading your disk subsystem.
