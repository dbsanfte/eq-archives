I'm guessing a trade window bug but the GM who replaced
the bags/items didn't say and it sounded like a reasonably
common request (i.e., I didn't get grilled a lot on what
happened.)

I'd shown the bags to one player but he cancelled the
trade and I saw the bags drop back into inventory.  I
went LD a few minutes later, signed back in about two
hours later and they were gone.  I'm positive I didn't
screw up the "trade" by accidentally hitting the Trade
button;  the only player I'd shown them to had cancelled
the trade and I'd seen them drop into inventory when he'd
done so.

The only weird thing was my log showed an NPC canceling
the trade instead of the player.  The GM just said (in
short) "Here I am, got the petition, gimme a sec to
recreate the bags" and popped into the zone I was in a
couple of minutes later, gave them to me, and zipped off...

*shrug* It was more aggravating than anything else:  the
bags would have cost me about 2500pp to get (or I'd have
had to go farm them again...)
