}Isn't that easily done by organizing a language fair, though?

No, that'll work, in -theory-.  But in practice, everyone who shows up 
speaks only their native tongues, except one guy who has Gnoll at 
'Mediocre'.  You can get the other languages by training a point in it, 
spam a friend until they get two skill ups, then zone, and the friend 
spams you for two points, zone, etc etc.  It's a major pain in the 
keister, but I've managed to get a couple oddball languages as high as 11 
or 12 that way...  Perhaps other people have more patient friends.  It 
will be much easier, though, I figure, to have each of my characters save 
up 100 practice points and master -one- oddball language a piece, then 
have someone act as a gobetween, learning them from one alt and teaching 
them to another.

There's this lovely (and by now probably out of date) Fippy's Facts:

So, what're the odds of one of the 1,783 people who are excellent in 
Orcish, across all servers, making it to your language fair?  Much less 
one of the 159 Masters!

And... if just you and a friend learn it, you can have obnoxious secret 
conversations right in front of everyone in /gu. :)
