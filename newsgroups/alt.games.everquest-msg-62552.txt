this guys post brings up a question. I know that Driana Poxbourne killed me
a long time ago in my lower levels. she was in EFP near the pod running
around loose and i died at the boat dock. Yet Later on new character 40
levels later she is running around outside WFP killing newbies. so i kill
her.

does she zone? or just spawn randomly in EFP and WFP?
both of theses would be unheard of to me. except for the sleeper i know he
zones when awoken.  and random spawning over more then 1 zone??
