For items that need to be activated from your inventory to work.  A
lot of summoned items work this way, most notably the guides used to
res healers.  Others include the underwater breathing item and the
health-to-power shard from summoners.  I don't know if there are
non-summoned items that go in there as well, but I would not be
surprised if there are.
