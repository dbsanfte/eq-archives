    Oh.  I was not aware of this (not playing a cleric, I am not "quite" as
knowledgeable of their spells as I am of my own).
    I had thought that atone was for clearing the hate list (or more
specifically removing the cleric from it). I hadn't realized that this meant
that the server lost all track of who should be getting exp for the kill.
    That actually sounds suspisciously like a bug.
