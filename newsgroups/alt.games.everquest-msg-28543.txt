Well, here is what I've noticed from playing the last day or so:  

My first monk partner has already gotten a few levels ahead of the
other monk and I so me and the second monk have been partnering; the
second monk also just recently got some fighting batons as a gift from
a nice high level player, and I just dinged 14 late last night, so we
were duoing for a while this morning when I had my new Walking Sleep
spell (upgrade to Drowsy, slows mob down between 23-32%, I believe,
for 60 mana)--still kept Drowsy memorized to use in case mob resisted
Walking Sleep.  I also had new Turtle Skin AC buff for the monk.

Anyway, with me doing the slow/med/heal/med routine, I would say much
of the time I had about 80% mana at the end of the fight, sometimes
full mana, sometimes would be down to 40% or less if the monk was
really getting hit hard; if he wound up with two skellies on him (or
else even if one skellie but was hitting hard and I was low mana) I
would jump in and melee.  But more often than not I would be at about
80% mana, he would be maybe one or one and a half bubbles of health
down, we would both sit down for a bit and I would med for a short bit
till 90% mana, then heal him again and we would both be ready to go;
sometimes if his mend worked I wouldn't even have to cast another heal
on him and he could start pulling again right away.

Yesterday, I was soloing in Kurns for a while and I saw another group,
monk and shaman, also fighting in there.  I was just watching them
fight for a minute in between my fighting and they were both meleeing.
Don't know how much mana the shaman had but I clicked on him and he
was at about 40-50% health (forgot how much health the monk had, but
they were only fighting one mob and I would guess the mob was probably
beating up on the shaman a lot more than the monk, don't know for
sure, though.  I've noticed, though, when I was grouping with two
monks that often the mob would really beat up on one and leave the
other one alone).

Anyway, I would guess that the monk and shaman probably killed the mob
faster with them both meleeing, but now the shaman would have to heal
himself up (and maybe the monk also, not sure, like I said), then have
to med to get the mana back from healing himself.  

So anyway, with the way me and the monk fought (me doing
slow/med/heal/med), the fights would last longer with just the monk
fighting, but there was less down time in between.  With the second
group (monk and shaman both meleeing), they killed the mob faster but
there would likely be more down time afterwards.  So it more likely
than not evens out in the long run.  

(And of course if me and the monk were both soloing instead of
partnering, we'd likely both kill our respective mobs in the same
amount of time as he would kill a mob while partnered with me, but
we'd both have more down time)

By the way, I haven't seen the rude monk around since our brief
encounter; of course he might just normally play at a different time
of the day than me or he might be playing another character.
