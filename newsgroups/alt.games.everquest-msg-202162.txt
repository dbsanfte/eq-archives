I think some of the loam pieces only drop from a semi-named elemental.
Best I can tell he's a random spawn though. Some other stuff like IGS
only drops from the rock golems IME. 

Loam is kinda irrelevant though, I'd much rather take the negative
charisma and wear netted kelp instead. Plus it's easier to get.

How is the castle area in Velks? Been debating taking a low 60s group
there sometime soon. I've never hunted much in Velks but that spot
might have potential since it's out of the way.
