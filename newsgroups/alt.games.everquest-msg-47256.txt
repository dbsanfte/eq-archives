Hey...Moonshadow is me!  They haven't responded to one of my
submissions in a long time.  Wish they'd picked my other recent
submission instead, though (I gave them a solution to the Ragefire
problem: make that part of SolB a 53+ PvP area with Sullon Zek rules,
whenever Naggy is not up).

It sure has made a big difference for my Barbarian Shaman.  E.g.,
standing in Misty Thicket at night, if I cast Serpent Sight, the
change is now very slight.  No real change in the landscape...it just
gets slightly redder.  Mobs become visible more clearly, perhaps
enough to make Serpent Sight still worth casting, but it is close.

My Human Bard in EC finds hunting at night no problem at all now.
