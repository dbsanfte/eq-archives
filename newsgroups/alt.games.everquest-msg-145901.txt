Note that this may have changed with the new exp changes post
50, its quite possible that the "real" exp now resides not with
a good duo or trio, but with a hard core full group.

Also spells bad news for the AE groups, which can kill
50 mobs as long as they are all not all that blue... cut their
exp in half, this did.

Solid group taking out even con mobs, thats the new
dream group I guess.
