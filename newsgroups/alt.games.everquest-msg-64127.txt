Well, I am doing better that many, It only took me three tries and
about 45 minutes to down load all the new files to run EQ less the SoL
expansion.

I logged on and immediately noticed that I can't see my Warriors eyes
through the slit in the Helm. I seem to recall reading something about
this phenom having to do with DirectX 7 vs 8.1, So I decided to look
at the Client INI....Hmm no line in the INI that addresses Driect X in
any way.

Any clues?
