But it is a shout. Your character is shouting out something to everyone. 
Who says it was designed to be some sort of emergency broadcast system? 
I'm in full agreement that it shouldn't be overused, but I do disagree 
with some scenarios where some consider its use inappropriate.

What the heck does /auction have to do with someone, say, shouting out 
for assistance defeating a particular creature?

I think that's a convention that's been applied somewhat incorrectly. 
The color red could merely be used to get your attention, not convey any 
sense of urgency - though with train notifications, for example, it 
would serve both purposes.

Well, if I lived in the world of EQ where there were no phones and it 
was an accepted means of communicating with the masses where I had no 
one specific person I should contact, then yes.

I understand that you're saying it's *not* an accepted means of 
communicating. I'm just questioning why. From an RP standpoint, it 
doesn't seem to make sense.

Of course, the example you cite there would only be particularly 
obnoxious due to the frequency and redundancy of the message. There is a 
distinct level of selfishness exhibited when one feels the need to spam 
the same phrase over and over and often. 1) They don't care who it might 
bother as long as they might catch that one person who will help them 
the moment they zone in, and 2) it's not consistent with an RP approach, 
as generally someone in need such as that would not have a key 
combination to merely repeat the exact same words over and over.

I merely think that if people use it in a manner consistent with RP, it 
would work and be appropriate.

But /auction would be an obviously inappropriate channel for something 
that has nothing at all to do with any sort of proposed transaction. Why 
use a completely unrelated channel? Just because people don't like to 
see red messages?

Again, that makes even less sense.

I get that. My question is, are they possibly being a bit overly 
sensitive? From a RP standpoint, wouldn't the shout channel be 
appropriate in many scenarios where it is presently discouraged by many?

I'm also thinking about it from a game design standpoint. For player to 
player communication, they've implemented /tell for person to person, 
/say for person to all present company, and it only makes sense that 
what follows is /shout for those outside of present company. Why would 
they expect us to go out of character for that?

I think it all boils down to people's appropriate usage of the /shout 
channel, not the channel's acceptible use scenarios. If people used it 
without spamming and with more of an RP approach (so as to be less 
disruptive to the game in general), I don't think there would be a 
problem at all.

It just doesn't seem to me that it should be considered abuse of the 
channel when it's used to communicate a game world message to those 
outside of present company in a non-conversational manner. That's what a 
shout is, right?

As I would think one *should* if it bothered them. /shrug
