Furthermore, unless it's been fixed, you have to hit <Return> in EQ1 
first to get the cursor in the chat window, then type "[tell....", unlike 
when doing a tell to someone within EQ1 where you can just type 
"/tell..." without first getting the cursor in the chat window.  Have not 
tried from eq2 yet.
