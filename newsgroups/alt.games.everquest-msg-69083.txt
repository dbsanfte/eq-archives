Get a friend who is a similar level druid

Go to Lake of Ill Omen

Go to the lake shore between the pillars where the goblin ruins are and look
out onto the lake, you will see four spires. Buff up and cast your pet and
haste it, don't forget to get the druid to buff your pet. At the foot of
each spire spawn two Bloodgill goblins. Use you air elemental form and have
a sow. Float out to the first spire and dip your head in the water, gfx bug
shows all beneath the water and you'll be able to see your prey. Swim down
to casting range for Tashan and target first bloodgill, turn around facing
away from the mob. Cast tashan and swim up until you surface and run with
your lev to the shore and awaiting druid friend. Run a little way into the
shore, there is a wideish area here. Two bloodgills are coming for your
blood. You still have your first mob targeted that is tashed. Keep clicking
mez and when mob is in range imez will cast and mez the first. The second
bloodgill will come and hit you. Back away and your pet will start tanking
it, Druid should snare this mob and once snared cast fear. Druid dots,
blasts and you blast also if you feel that way. Mob dies very quickly. Druid
snares other mob, you break mez with DD and repeat once Bloodgill hits you
and your pet is slapping it. Do the same for all four pillar spawn points.
Takes a little practise but once you get going you wont believe the extreme
exp rush.
