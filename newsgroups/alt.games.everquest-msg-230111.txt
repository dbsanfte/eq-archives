Well, the Ft3 and buff extension are hard to beat, but you -would- also 
gain haste of mithaniel, which is an upgrade to spell haste IV, speeding 
up casting of heals (except Cheal) and buffs by even more than SHIV 
would.  Still not a good tradeoff for the shawl, but much better deal 
than you thought.  And since most people don't have the shawl, for most 
healers its one of the better items you can get for shoulders, 
particularly considering how easy it is to come by.

There's also a healer head piece thats pretty nice as I recall, due 
again to its focus effect, not its stats per se.

Been a long time though.

Splendid
