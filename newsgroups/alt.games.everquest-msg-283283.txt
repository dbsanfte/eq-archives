Stun, IIRC, is on the same clock as snare and jolt, but not flurry or 
volley.  Since you rarely need to spam snare (only when mobs get down to 
"run away" so fast you won't have time to stun and then wait for the axe 
to cycle back), and shouldn't need to spam jolt if the MT is any good 
(and certainly not if you're MT), I don't see any reason -not- to chain 
stun, unless you're worried about stealing aggro with it.

If it only sticks half the time, thats still the equivalent of what, a 
25% additional slow which stacks on top of any other slow in the game? 
AND stacks with other stunners, to a lesser extent?

To me, manna free stunning was one of the biggest contributions a 
Berserk could make to a group, and one of the reasons I pretty much 
abandoned the class at around 56; too many mobs were immune to my stun! 
  I later found that this was partially due to being in groups which 
were going after red to me mobs, and partially due to not having leveled 
up enough for the next stun axe up.

Well, with stun my 'Zerker could tank pretty well, lots of HP and mob 
being asleep during half the fight so his DPS was way down.  On an 
unstunnable mob, though, I tanked about as well as a rogue, which is to 
say "I'll stand here and keep his attention while you rez the real 
tank... be ready to rez me after"

Yeah, that was always a problem, if I wanted a group I usually had to 
form it myself, because people had no idea what to do with me; even if a 
random group did take me in, the leader would usually not make good use 
of the resource.

As leader, though, I could look at the rest of the group, decide where 
I'd do the most good, and arrange things that way.  I did have some 
"regular" groups who'd become educated thru this process and would call 
me up when they had a slot where they could use me.  As often, I'd just 
solo; my 'zerker concentrated pretty heavy on regen, and for a long time 
there could just chain down pretty much anything he could pull single, 
taking little enough damage that his regen rate reduced "down time" to 
"long enough to send a tell to a buddy"
