Depends on your level, and what you are wearing now. As a Bard you
will never be a Tank. You need to realize that you are a caster that
can wear plate armor. That being said, you want to get as much AC as
possible.

Banded armor (player made) will serve you well into your high teens.
You should next move on to *Bronze or Fine Steel if you can afford it.
After that you have your Bardic Quest Armor (Lambent-- Bright Blue in
color).

On my server you can buy a full suit of banded for 90p in East
Commonlands.

You might also want to invest in a fast magic weapon. This will
benefit you in two ways.

1. With your level 7 self-haste song you will hit more often and kill
things much faster.

2. You can hunt willowisps for Lightstones and Greater Lightstones and
make decent cash and exp from levels 8-15.

With your 200p you may be able to pick up Bladed Thullien Claws (5/19
1HS). I still use mine at level 27. Or a Dragoon Dirk (magic dagger)
for 25-30pp

*Bronze armor is very heavy. As a Half-Elf you might want to stick
with banded. The added AC with Bronze is not always worth the weight
penalty.
