I may pack up and head to S. Ro tonight if I don't leave for OoT. Having
made twelve and memmed up the new spells, I took off for Lavastorm and
Najena. I have to tell you, what looks good on paper isn't always as
lovely in the reality of it. In Lavastorm I attempted to set up
operations from the entrance to Najena, figuring there was a convenient
zone line nearby in case of trouble. Now, assuming you can pull nothing
but drakes and rock dervishes, it looks doable. But there is a little
downtime. Found out you can NOT med in the Najena tunnel at my level.
The imps path by (over) close enough to aggro and wiped the floor with
me twice.

No problem, I figured I'd just give Najena a shot. Well, if you stick
with only the skellie near the entrance and the two in the first cave, a
young necro can safely solo there all day long. But that's only *three*
mobs every eighteen minutes. Not very fucking productive. When I tried
to pull the fourth one, further in the hall, I got the ogre guard and
all five skellies that surround him in the first firepit room. (Looked
like all five. I was running away screaming too fast to accurately count
them all, and leaving poor Kabn to his own sad end.) Even if I could
find a better way to pull that fourth skellie, that's still not enough
action by a long shot to make it a "good" spot to solo. And I know I
can't break that room with the ogre guard using the tools I currently
have. 

Thinking ahead, I'm guessing that the three sirens in OoT will be the
same problem as Najena unless they respawn faster. For the life of me I
cant' remember their respawn rate. (Anyone? Anyone? Beuler?)
