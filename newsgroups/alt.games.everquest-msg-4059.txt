Outdoors zones are usually bad for getting cash, except for the Hill
giants in Rathe Mountains.
Start looting more, and try to get groups in dungeons. At 34, Splitpaw
and Cazic Thule can still be good for exp, and a lot of fine steel
drops. You usually have to bring your own group to Kunark dungeons
like Droga and Dalnir. I don't know how loot is at 34 in Velious
(don't have it yet) but you might want to give it a try. Lower Guk was
mentioned, but depending on class, 34 could be way too early to try
for groups in there, and it can be a deathtrap.

Lykke til :)
