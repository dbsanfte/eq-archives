I've seen one guy doing the "/ooc porting for plat.... I've been burned before,
 pay in advance" number.  He DOES have a clause at the end:  "Corpse runs are
free of course, just pay me when you get a chance" which I think is nice.
While I totally sympathize,  I think that you are telling your "customers"
right up front that you don't trust them one little bit.  Not a good way to
build repoire with your customer base.  I advise against it.
I don't port much anymore because I just don't need 10 or 20 plat that bad.
I never ask for payment in advance, and so far I have only been burned once. 
That person and the two gentlemen he had with him all went on my "no ports, no
rezzes, no sows, no heals, no nothing list".  And of course they went on my
ignore list.  They weren't guilded or they'd have been reported to their guild
leader too.
My nicest "fare"?  Braided Ivy Cords.  I ported a guy who sent me a tell. 
Didn't offer any money in his tell.  Asked me to run to where he was to meet
him, (said he didn't know the zone very well).   But he was very polite and
over level 40 and there was just something about the way he asked... I normally
don't knock myself out for strangers.  Nice reward since he could have given me
*zip*.
I've also had people ask me *after* the port how much they owed me.  To which
I've always said "whatever you think is fair and can afford".   (I sure wish my
car dealership service center worked that way :)
