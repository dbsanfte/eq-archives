I await delivery.

I've always been surprised that they haven't found suitably
possible "weird changes" and implemented them for 24 hours either 
on April 1 of each year, or as some random GM event.  There's
so much that they could do to liven things up in ways that would
not require massive programming changes.

For example, for one day every caster has the equivalent of
a C12 as their normal mana regen, and melee characters regen HP
at a ridiculous rate.

Or every single mob is KoS to everyone.  Or, every single mob
is *non*KoS to everyone.

Or every NPC speaks only Ogre language -- and must be spoken to
in that language to trigger quests.

Mob spawn points within each zone are randomly shuffled.

Every spawn point within Dreadlands is Gorenaire.  But only
one drops her usual loot.

Giant Rats get the knockback spell and aggro regardless of
player level.

All the water has mysteriously drained out of Kedge Keep
and the Lake of Ill Omen.  But for some reason the Plane of Knowledge
is under forty feet of water.

And so on.  Sure, it'd be unbalancing, but it'd only be for a day,
and it would be one giant party of "playing with the system" for
a day, having fun.
