_Mostly_ pointless.  Really had more to do with the total lack of
identification of himself in-game.  Even you have taken to mentioning
a character name here and there in recent months, and you've always
been ready to identify Tunare as your "main" server (or as far back
as my decrepit memory serves anyway).  All he mentioned was level
and class, and in the context those made the post I replied to look
completely absurd to me.
