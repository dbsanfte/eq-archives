You can add crap monk to the list untill such time as they fix them :p
Incidently druids are no longer at the bottom of my list for character
power. They not at the top by any means but no longer at the bottom
(paladins may be there now, along with monks).

When going through trials you pretty much get what you can take . I will
eventually blackmail friends who play worthy classes and get my gimped monk
through. I should not have to do this though. Frankly the problem is finding
another decent chanter . I put ALOT of people through the trials with my
chanter, but other decent chanters are usually off doing something so hard
to nab one. The good clerics are usually busy as well. I did not have the
proper sense of urgency before we started killing aerin dar but now all of
my guild is off in pov, pos , or hoh most of the time . I do not like
playing with the rest of the gimps damnit !

Oh and the drop rate for spectrals in hoh sucks ass. You will be there
awhile :( maybe another tier 3 or 4 zone will be better for farming them. I
certainly hope so.
