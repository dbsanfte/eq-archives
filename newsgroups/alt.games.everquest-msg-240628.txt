That's what i will reference for sell back since i'm not in game atm.
It can be backchecked at your leisure.

From my old smithing files... after you trivial the 1 ring combines at
135 with Ornate Gold Chain Bracelet. And the bracelet for reference
is:

Ornate Gold Chain Bracelet	Cost: 21272.5cu 	Trivial: 135
1 Chainmail Bracer Pattern	Cost: 2100cu
1 High Quality Rings		Cost: 8662.5cu
1 Gold Bar			Cost: 10500cu
1 Smithy Hammer		Cost: N/A
1 Water Flask			Cost: 10cu

Sell Back = 15250cu
% returned = 15250cu/21272.5cu * 100 = 71.7%

That 71.7% sell back gets you to 135. If you look at my comment.. this
is acceptable due to the fact Fine Plate pays on a success and until
around 130-135 the failures can become an issue. And really, one ring
bracelet is extremely easy to get, especially if you buy 4 unrefined
in the bazaar to respawn the HQ ore npc.

After that combine you have selective 2-3 ring combines you can do
that trivial at a max of 148. Broken by recipe these are:

Ornate Gold Chain Coif		Cost: 31855cu	Trivial: 146
1 Chainmail Coif Pattern		Cost: 4020cu
2 High Quality Rings		Cost: 17325cu
1 Gold Bar			Cost: 10500cu
1 Smithy Hammer		Cost: N/A
1 Water Flask			Cost: 10cu

Sell Back = 20500cu
% returned = 20500cu/31855cu * 100 = 62.4%

Ornate Gold Chain Gloves	Cost: 35185cu	Trivial: 142
1 Chainmail Gauntlets Pattern	Cost: 7350cu
2 High Quality Rings		Cost: 17325cu
1 Gold Bar			Cost: 10500cu
1 Smithy Hammer		Cost: N/A
1 Water Flask			Cost: 10cu

Sell Back = 23510cu
% returned = 23510cu/35185cu * 100 = 66.8%

Ornate Gold Chain Leggings	Cost: 43847.5cu	Trivial: 148
1 Chainmail Leggings Pattern	Cost: 7350cu
3 High Quality Rings		Cost: 25987.5cu
1 Gold Bar			Cost: 10500cu
1 Smithy Hammer		Cost: N/A
1 Water Flask			Cost: 10cu

Sell Back = 23510cu
% returned = 23510cu/31250cu * 100 = 75.2%

None of which are even close to 90% sellback. Some of which, granted
are a bit higher than 50%. Leggings are your best, but granted I
haven't itemized each and every recipe. Maybe there is some recipe
deep in ornate chain that provides this 90% return. If so, please post
it so the next person doing ornate chain knows what his best bang for
his buck is because most of the recipes aren't that clear cut..

Now, transitioning to fine plate you have:

Fine Plate Visor			Cost: 25755cu	Trivial: 163
1 Plate Visor Mold		Cost: 5250cu
1 Folded MQ Sheet of Metal	Cost: 20495cu(vendor)
1 Leather Padding		Cost:
1 Smithy Hammer		Cost: N/A
1 Water Flask			Cost: 10cu

Sell Back = 27000cu

Now, the unknown of course is leather padding. Some people farm all
parts, some people farm just the silks, some people just buy in the
bazaar for 25pp. In my case my leather padding always cost 5pp.. cause
that's what i bought the pelts for and then farmed the silk in the
feerott. But this was back when a couple hours of farming could get
you 6 stacks of silk. That's why I made the statement:

> the sell back for Fine Plate is ~ the cost of ore and molds.

And it holds true up through the combines. In the case of the Visor...
ore and mold is 25745cu and sell back pays for that.  Actually.. if
you farm all and have a successful combine your only loss is a 25755cu
charge every time you fail.

You also need to bear in mind, when I was doing this.. plat actually
meant something to me and I didn't have a lot to throw around. Having
runs of 40 basically cost me a hundred or so pp after the bank account
got done rolling over was grand. These days I'm sure the one-click
tradeskill groupies can just dump money in exchange for bumps through
ornate gold chain or even just buy the padding in the bazaar at 45pp
per. I certainly have friends who weren't shy about dropping whatever
it took in money to just get their skills as high as they could go
once the tradeskill changes went into effect. You can pretty much
blast most skills if you got the money to drop. After all, if you are
advanced enough to camp TSR and roll high you'll have enough money in
one drop to go.. why even bother farming spiderling silk?

>And I just did Smithing up to 180, so the memories are fresh. :)

Did mine a while ago, but after the smithing nerf.
