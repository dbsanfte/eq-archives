I think it would be nice, you can pass out a key to guildies or friends,
have some option to lock them out and stuff, and at the same time maybe
increase vault size slightly or a whole new vault, seperate from the bank.
It wouldnt be too hard, just make new zones near cities. It doesnt have to
cost any money at all, the AC houses are done by quest, and I think some
money, but not too much
