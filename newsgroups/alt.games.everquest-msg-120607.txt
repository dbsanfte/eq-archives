You ever hear the phrase "actions speak louder than words"? I am not
assuming anything. Her actions (or lack thereof) leading up to his
death are clearly recorded in the article.

The type of lawsuit she filed is ALL about money. It's a typical stab
at a "deep-pockets" corporation. This whole thing would go away if
Sone/VI offered her a cash settlement. 

You are obviously too clouded by empathy to see the facts clearly. I
suggest you direct some of your empathy towards the EQ (and every
other MMPRPG) community that will be put on trial over this. One
isolated incident, and our whole community is made to look like a
bunch of dysfunctional addicts by the main stream media. 

The only  "appalling lack of humanity" I have seen is the mother's
total disregard for her sons life in the years/months/days leading up
to his suicide. She should be charged with depraved indifference.
Kicking him out and leaving him to his own devices when she knew he
was unstable is criminal.
