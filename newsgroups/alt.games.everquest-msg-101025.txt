I dueled for the first time last night.  I've never done that before since
my Bard is already "ghetto" enough, I don't need to lose anything.  Did a
"friendly" no-loot duel with a friend last night.  No problem, 38 Warrior
against my 38 Bard, it really wasn't any more than slow him with chains and
throw Dot's on him.
However...one thing perplexed me.  LAG!!

We are both on cable modem not far from each other.  We are both in New
England, so fairly close.  I was staying far enough away to dot him, same as
I do with mobs, and he still got in quite a few hits.  It was a cake walk,
but is this normal?  He wasn't even close to me!

It was really fun playing against someone, but if that's what I can expect,
I don't intend on doing so again unless just for fun.

He had only asked that I don't actually kill him.  He said "you win" and
zoned.  I've never seen the "so-and-so   has fled like a cowardly dog!" zone
spam when you log during a duel before.  Funny!

Sean...
