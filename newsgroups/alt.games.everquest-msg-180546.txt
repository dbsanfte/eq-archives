Guys look around, all over newsgroup, you will get real example of what
spamming is,
Spammers post multiple messages in same newsgroups, link messages to
multiple newsgroup, covers (if they smart enough) their ip or use
applications already made for mass emailing. Spam from a internet coffee
shop at worse.

You think if i would be spamming i would do it openly like that, and for
pool?? you may fiind more spam about how to pay your debt, enlarge your
penis, get a new wife or god knows what. I made and still make a public
announcement on a public channel, its like if i want to tell everybody in
the street i love them or someone will try to break the worl record for
nagging, that is society a mix of everything and nothing :-)

If i loose my isp by miracle for something i havent done or for posting a
public announcement related to an event, or i changed my nickname 100 times,
that is still nonsense and familiar topics in multiple newsgroup can be
found just like this one. You will find  message like that and writing about
some dont like or want in the newsgroup, and so isp treats, so discussion
over Spamming laws and want you can and cannot do occurs, you can also see
on some of them the heat of word flying in the air before the vanish. Basic
normal stuff. Welcome to the world 2003.

Where Countrys fight over oils, people starved and die, some work hard to
pay the bills others to buy that new car or get a head from a nice W###e, us
we argu about the fact i posted a mention on A WORLD RECORD ATTEMP in speed
pool which is to pot in 24hr 17 000 pool balls.

Like i said.

Have a great day, and keep complaining you gonna bring this single
meaningless post out of millions with few dozens of replies. Hey if im lucky
you may make me a famous criminal or a superstar.

Oh and by the way ,

you can if you want, kiss my rear end, but again only if you feel like it.

you mama says hello!


Take care!
And like Nash said, "Shoot for Peace" and Bob said "Tell the children the
truth"
