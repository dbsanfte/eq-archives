Hehe some ppl discover the potential of hybrid, some never do. And with a
wizzy (or whatever) landing a big nuke to temp take agro and to allow you to
bs it's gonna work great. On one occasion had a group with 3 wizzies and one
dru. Mobs too hard to tank to for druids but getting turns in agro and
kiting when it's your turn, it's still a winning combo. You don't need
balanced groups at all unvbalanced groups that are aware of their
strongpoints and weaknesses are as good as stereotype balanced groups. It's
just a search for a winning recipe. Even a monk or ranger could be a nice
addition.
