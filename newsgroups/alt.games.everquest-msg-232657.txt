my particular hot button is those IT buffoons that would load a major 
program change into the compters at 5 pm, and go home for the night...at 
an alarm monitoring company that had that particular operations center 
monitoring the alarms for 90% of the east coast from maine to florida 
[it skipped north and south carolina and part of alabama].....

squeeze me? *when* is the busy time for an alarm monitoring service? hm, 
could it *possibly* be when people are closing their businesses and 
going home for the night?

certainly, lets load a process into the main server that is going to 
slow down and possibly *lock* the computer, and LEAVE....

i can remember one occasion where the computer locked for 4 hours while 
they tried to track down the id10t in charge who wafted off to her 
boyfriends place and left the pager at home because she didnt want to be 
disturbed.

I dont like SOE's little maintenance shutdowns, i agree they should have 
24 hours notice unless it is an actual server crash...i would think they 
know their little programmers are working on a patch with a bit more 
than 4 hours of notification..though i have this mental image of a pair 
of programmers thinking hey, this would work - lets load it up and smoke 
test it before the others getback from lunch...
