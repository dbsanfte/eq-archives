Death erases any and all spell effects for obvious reasons.  Rezzing
also erases any spell effects for obvious reasons.  So, while it
really sucks to lose your KEI becuase of death, it would be even worse
if you then got another KEI before being ressurected.  This is my
understanding of death and spell effects; correct me if I am wrong,
please.

Do you think the game designers should have included a spell so
powerful that players dread losing its effects more than losing their
lives?  Hmmm...
