You see I would have agreed on the "leapfrog" comment if he had been 
preparing to go in alone...it would have been fun to watch after all, 
and some of us get an insane thrill from occasionally going "He is so 
out of my league it's unbelievable, but that never stopped me 
before!"...but he was out of line complaining simply because he was 
waiting for another team he could tag on to. Obviously he could ask to 
join your group politely, but if the answer's no, he should either jump 
in alone or stand aside for your guys.

That's a lovely ending, it may have been beyond the call but at least 
you made someone happy :-)
