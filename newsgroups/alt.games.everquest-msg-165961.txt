You've gotten some good suggestions already, but you might want to also
consider a group in Crystal Caverns, assuming you ever do the bazaar
thing. If you can save up a buttload of the velium that drops there you
can make some money. It drops as pieces, blocks, bricks, etc. If you can
get some summoned mage weight reduction bags ahead of time, that will
help. Save them up and sell them in the bazaar. They are still used in a
fair number of desirable tradeskill recipies and you can sell them for a
good bit.
