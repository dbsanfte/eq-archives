Don't take this the wrong way, but you might want to consider remaking your
character now, before you have too much time invested in it. Enchanters who
are other than agnostic pretty much make their illusion spells useless in a
number of cities, and since one of the benefits of being an enchanter is
being able to travel freely virtually anywhere, well. . .   it's just
better/easier/more useful to be agnostic. For example, I would expect that as
a Prexus worshipper, you can forget doing the Stein of Moggok quest without
some serious faction work. It's a quest you can complete at level 12 with an
agnostic chanter (8, if you are a dark elf) that results in a nice (+10int
+5dex) handheld item that sells for about 150-200pp. Lots of baby chanters
pay for their equipment upgrades and spells with the proceeds from that
quest. . .
