That seems to be the consensus and makes sense after hearing collected
thoughts.

Ok, *this* is the data that I was missing. Now I completely understand the
argument for acquiring AA's at 65 vs. 52. Thanks for the awesome read-out on
the experience curve.

Of course, I have other reasons now for holding at 52, but perhaps a better
way of passing my time now would be to resume my tradeskilling objectives.
I've started making various Gate potions, which are quite useful handing out
to my Gate-less friends. Even for me. I always keep on hand a 10-dose
Gate-to-Shadeweaver Thicket potion since the gate-to point is just a few
steps away from the PoK portal and this allows me to change my Bind point
arbitrarily and still have easy home access.
