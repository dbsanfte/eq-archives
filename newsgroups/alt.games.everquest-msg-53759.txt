No one can rob me of something I give away freely.

Same can be said with any other hobby...  Give up reading now!!!  It takes
your free time away!!!

This is called Obsessive/Compulsive disorder... If you suffer from this, a
visit to a Psychologist should be in order...

Money is not a problem with me...I have plenty of dollars in the bank, so I
don't mind the $9.89 it costs me a month to do something I enjoy doing.

Amd I -do-...  Go out, have fun, and I also have online friends via EQ, that
I socialize with...  As the Greeks put it so many millenia ago...
"Everything in moderation".

And how, pray tell, is EQ having a negative impact on my life?  Besides
having trolls such as yourself tell me what to do with it?  Sorry, my life
is my own... You go away now.
