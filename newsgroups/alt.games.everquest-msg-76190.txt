Yes, I know there is this claim of a 15 minute cycle, but, when I arrive at
the Nexus, go over to the pad I need, sit down, wait 3 or 4 minutes, then
hear the anouncement of 15 minutes to go, I tend to doubt that 15 minute
cycle time.  In another thread, someone mentioned timing it at 29 minutes, 1
second.
