    I can -somewhat- agree... although I would like to see Superior Healing
maybe at 45, instead of the 51 we currently get it... Simply because at 45,
casting Greater Heal on a tank does didly squat...  So, if the healer's OOM,
well, bye-bye tank.. Heh...  Now, at 51 (and 52 where I am currently at),
Superior Healing is a -decent- backup heal for tanks, and very good for
casters...  But I can remember thinking "Sheesh, this is completely useless"
(referring to Greater Heal)...

    But at 52, I'm satisfied with my healing capabilities... After all, I
am -not- a Cleric.. Healing and Rezzing is a cleric's main specialty...  We
Druids are more of a "jack of all trades" type character...  Need a back-up
healer?  Sure, we can help.. need someone to help nuke or dot?  Sure, we're
there...  Did some silly Necro not even in the party decide to fear his adds
off in the middle of the dungeon, and now we got the entire dungeon munching
on our arses?  *Succor*  Heh.. :)
