 Of course you'll still get the idiot crowd who ignore yells, their loss
though. I have " /shout train to zone, yelling as i go so move if you see
it! " followed by yells, if it's a long train i try to hit my shout to least
once more for people zoning in. Never can keep people happy though, you
still get nasty replies /sigh
