Thanks for the reply.  It seems I fair much better against the shaman and druid
type casters.  The wizards or strong DD casters seem to be the trouble.  I
can't out-nuke them at even con very well.  I'm trying my velium scimitar
against them since it has such a low delay and even procs now (12 pts. not
too great but better than none).  Hope to interrupt the casts I guess.
