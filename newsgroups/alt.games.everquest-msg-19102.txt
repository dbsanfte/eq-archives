You may have seen my rules for how to get buffs; I would be a hypocrite if I did not
follow them myself. Rosewhite is the only of my characters to actually be on /roleplay,
but my others know when to put on the act, as it were. Be polite, ask in character, and
*always* say flat out that you are willing to pay. It won't guarantee results, but it
will definitely increase your chances.
