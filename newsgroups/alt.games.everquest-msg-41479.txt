It's theoretically a future spell available with Luclin (supposed to be a
group version of all skin spells), but Verant might well be throwing out
decoy information. The info apparently comes from parsing data files updated
on your PC, but VI has put misleading info in there in the past to deter
spoilers.  Doesn't exist as of today in any case.
