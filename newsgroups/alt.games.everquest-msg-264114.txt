Money does not = gear, except at the lower end of the game.  Money can 
be turned into gear, but gear can also be looted or gotten from quests 
or trade skills.  And gear can, very often (but not always) be turned 
into money, so selling buffs is -not- the only way to get money.

Selling buffs isn't even a particularly -good- way to earn money; talk 
to people who are doing it and you'll find that their pp per hour isn't 
particularly impressive; its just that its safe and allows them to earn 
while not paying much attention.

Why is it degrading to trade sex for money?  Some would argue that it 
isn't; that its just performing a service no different from changing 
your tires or mowing your lawn.  But when its very easy to do, but only 
part of the population can do it and fewer are willing to, and you get 
paid very good money despite not needing any skill, well, its whoring. 
Some people are OK with that.  But that doesn't make it not what it is. 
  Sitting around in POK casting buffs for money isn't challenging or risky.

Yes, a cleric rezzing for donations is a whore... or rather, an escort, 
since she/he will have to travel to your location, or at least meet you 
partway.  My cleric put out the red light a few times, but by and large 
would rez for free or not at all, turning down all donations but 
insisting on Ale instead.

All of that, however, evades the point, which is that if druids were 
suddenly given the magical ability to give purple dandelions out on 
demand, and somehow purple dandelions were desirable in POK and you 
could get cash for them, this wouldn't have anything to do with 
desirablity for druids in groups.

You started out very well in this paragraph, but then made a sharp left 
into non sequitor.  No KEI?  No Virtue?  So what?  These make those 
classes -less- desirable in a group, not more!  Long duration buffs 
available from the whores in POK mean your group can take other classes 
instead, but still get partial benefit from the enchanter and cleric. 
Throw in long duration haste for the tanks and a cleric willing to come 
rez on demand and you've killed half the need for each class!

POTC is not comperable to KEI, which is the longest duration mana boost, 
nor to Virtue, which is the POP level cleric HP/AC buff; you need to 
compare either POTC vs Aego or Po9 vs Virtue and vs KEI.  Even then, I 
think you'll generally get less interest, but at least you'll be on a 
level playing field.

I think you are right, if enchanters were removed from the  game there 
would be an outcry, but it would be because we'd miss the crowd control, 
not the KEI.  I think there would be a larger outcry if clerics were 
removed, but it would be because much of the game is built around CHeal 
at the moment, and because even without Cheal clerics are hands down the 
best healers (if you have a slower), and because cleric rez in the party 
is handy (although I'm sure we'd all learn to cope with  a "mere" 
paladin rez soon enough, but then they'd become the new darling class)

Very very few zones require a wizard port, and they aren't zones people 
commonly want to get to, this might have been a point back in pre 
Velious days, but stopped being relevant about then for all but a few 
raids.

Paladins in LFaY LDoN's are a bit more useful than elsewhere, but far 
far far from required.

Rogues are required for more places than wizards are, but still less 
than 1% of the game, and in many places there are ways around even that 
minimal requirement.  Rogues are desirable in groups because they are 
great DPS and to a lesser extent make decent pullers... but in general 
rogues are not desired by groups even when they should be, because early 
fears of them pickpocketing all the loot got them frowned upon, even in 
the high end where little in the way of useful loot -can- be pickpocketed.

I can't really think of a class you couldn't remove from the game 
entirely without completely breaking the game; clerics come close, there 
are some mid high end things that would become very much harder without 
clerics, perhaps some that would become impossible, but again, we are 
talking under 1% of the game.  Even this is largely because of a 
mistake; the single spell Complete Heal, if eliminated from a cleric's 
book, would have the same effect as removing the entire class.

This is quite true; druids aren't best at anything, they are merely good 
at many things.  Second best DS; if your party doesn't include a mage, a 
Druid can take care of that for you.  Second tier DD; if you've got 
nothing better to do with your mana, you can provide pretty good damage 
via nuking; not on a par with wizards perhaps, but not noticably worse 
than mages.  Second best healing; yes a cleric can do it better, but a 
shaman is even worse than you, and those are the only "real" healer 
classes.  Since most situations don't require cleric level healing, 
bringing a druid along who can do all thats needed -and- provide more 
utility otherwise isn't a bad plan.

As I detail above, there very few classes which couldn't vanish without 
any impact, and even those classes could be worked around for almost all 
purposes.  Classes generally overlap their abilities with other classes; 
if enchanters vanish, we still have bards and necromancers to do most of 
their jobs, if paladins vanish we still have warriors and SK (and 
clerics), so on and so forth.

If you really want to lament something, try the berserker, a similar 
"jack of all trades" type class to the druid, only as a tank/DPS engine 
instead of a healer/nuker engine.  At around 55 the key element of a 
berserker, the stun, which allows him to tank on demand or add partial 
slowing to his relatively low DPS, combined with a DPS which doesn't 
keep pace with that of other DPS classes, means that the class which 
could do either job relatively well gradually loses the ability to 
perform in both categories, without gaining any new job.

I think this puts him in an even worse situation than the monk, which at 
least has FD to fall back on (although still admittedly close on second 
for worst class at the high end)

Grage, 58 berserker, Luclin
Splendid One, 65 mage, Firiona Vie
Llyric, 57 bard, Morell Thule
Bergh Brelltender, 65 cleric, Morell Thule
Paax, 52 shaman, Morell Thule

and a host of sub 50 alts including a 30 chanter
