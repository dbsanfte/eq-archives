Go to a zone far away from bind points like RM, or OOT.
Pricing...well I charge occasionally. If I am in a good group and getting to
thier corpse mean leaving my group and traveling to them, then yes I charge.
I know some of you gripe about clerics charging for rezzing, my response is
then don't pay. If I am not busy and the corpse is easy to get to then no I
don't charge. Before I get flamed for charging please think about
it...clerics are not the easiest to level, they don't travel well, can get
our butts kicked by greenies easily enough, if I am going to leave an xp
group without a healer or lose my spot then it had better be worth something
to me. If porting spells took the mana the a rez takes and you couldn't just
port back to your group and sow and invis/camo yourself for the run you
would charge for the ports also. BTW, I have a druid and a wizzy and never
charge for my services with the druid (of course she can't group TP yet
either) and stopped charging with my wizzy now that I have Jboots and
translocate spells.
BTW, don't go /roleplay very often either, mainly at guild events. But have
been asked to leave fear,  hate and Naggy raids to go rez someone, hehe.
