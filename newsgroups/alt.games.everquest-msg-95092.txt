Both of these methods are essentially the same thing.

And both will fail.

You must be high amiable or better to turn in the Coldain quest pieces.
Invisibility only raises you to Indifferent.   If you turn in the quest arms
at indifferent, they will be poofed.  The second person can turn in the gems
in any order, but since the Quest NPC has not recieved the arms from a person
who has sufficient faction, the quest will not be completed.


If your friend with the quest drop is KoS, btw... he will die the moment he
puts the arms in a trade window with the NPC.  Invis (not sneak) will break
when that happens.   If he is only dubious or so, you can re-cast invis before
he hits accept... but, see above.... indifferent is not high enough to
complete these quests.
