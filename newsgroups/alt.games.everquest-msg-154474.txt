4 song twists are really easy and only require 2 quick
clicks on your mouse.

Make a user defined social key. I use 2 of these for my
4 song twists.

Put the four songs you want to twist in slots 1,2,3,4 on
your song slots.

I use chant of frost/flame/fufils/heal alot for kiting.  The heal
is there because you almost always take some dmg kiting
and with that in the mix you NEVER have to stop.  I give
up minimal extra dmg from a bellow or something but no
big deal.  If you are under lvl 49 then you will have to
twist in selos if you dont have jboots or potions.

Now to make the hotkeys, right click on one of your socials.
Change the name of the key to 'song 1'.  Put in these lines

/stopsong
/cast 1
/pause 30
/cast 2

There you have it, now that hotkey will instantly twist 2 songs.
Just unmem and remem songs in your first 4 slots if you want
to twist different things.  Fear/snare work well for fear kiting,
and mana/clarity are good for downtime.  This makes life so
much easier.

Repeat for songs 3 and 4.  It is possible to twist 4 songs without
losing any of them but most of the time you are going to drop a
song for half a tick or less.  Really doesnt mean much for kiting.

As for switching off instruments, I use the newui in 1024/768 reso
and i just keep my last backpack opened right next to my hotkey bank
The instruments line up directly with my primary and secondary slots
which I have moved to my hotkeys.  Very easy to swap out weapons
and instruments.
