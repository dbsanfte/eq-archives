Hitler likely did think it was for the greater good.  Doens't make him
right.  The acts he committed in his dementia were evil.  His knowing
subordinates, such as Goebels (spelling???) were evil.  He knew what he was
doing, but he was more interested in getting ahead than about good.  Others,
like Erwin Rommel, are harder to place.  Rommel hated the Nazi part, yet he
fought for the fatherland.  Arguably, he should have been fighting to take
Germany back from the likes of Hitler, but it's easier to fight a foreign
enemy than a domestic one.  It seems in the thirties, much evil was done by
those who were to weak to take action (Rommel, the Pope... Innocent, I
believe, Nevil Chamberlin), and allowed those who were truely evil to
prosper.

Now, as for Stalin... remember that the Boshevik revolution and the
resulting pogroms were the second largest massacres in history, beaten only
by Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution (that's right, the Holocaust came in
third).  I would definatly say that those two leaders were evil.

It happens.  Pop-culture has poo-pooed the idea of evil.  If nothing is
verboten (except traditional values), then life is easier for the hedonist.
