It felt so good the first time I kill that ranger byatch in qeynos hill :-)
Her gay partner got eaten by a bear? Too bad I don't have a chance to feed
him to my pet.

There is a level 4 or 5 newbie guard in qeynos hill too. I forgot his name,
but if you stay near the tower, you can over heard him say something like
"I'll go partrol the hill now" or something like that. He drops a card on
the ground once in a while. Go train 2 giant rats to him and watch him die,
lol.
