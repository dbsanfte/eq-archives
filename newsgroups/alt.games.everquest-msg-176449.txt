I finally solved my "problem" with the MusicPlayerWin not working.

If you create a nosound.txt file in your EQ directory, not only will
your Music Player not function (you can't turn it on with /mp3 or ALT+K,
and no error/warning message), but any character that had it visible
when you created the file won't be playable.  EQ will crash when trying
to load the UI if you select one of those characters and "Enter World".

I thought I had tried deleting that file, but I must have been doing
something else at the same time and just thought I had done so, because
when I deleted it this time on a whim, I had access to the Music Player
on all characters.  Just to make sure, I created the file again and
tried to load a character with an active Music Player, and it crashed
after character select.  *sigh*

Not exactly the most intuitive way of saying "You disabled your sound,
dumb ass!"  Bah!  I /bug'd the invalid (IMO) behavior.
