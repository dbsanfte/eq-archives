God damn, Bizbee... he was pointing out something that is true. The same
topics are generally posted a lot because there is much to be said about
them. Name policy, begging, farming, Luclin nerfs, etc...

You don't have to reply to each post with guns blazing and flamethrower
ready. He was pretty polite to you, considering of what he -could- have
said, but of course you don't show him the same courtesy.

He could have said, "Shut the hell up Bizbee! You're wrong - I'm right." He
chose to make an observation to prove his point, rather than the typical
flame that is used on the internet. <Gasp!>
