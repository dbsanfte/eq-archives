I completely agree, in my opinion those rats represent the infastation of
rats living in the restraunt, and since the rats brag on how good the food
is, they must be eating it.. which would suggest they are walking around on
the tables and food and stuff. thats just gross.   I used to keep hamsters
as pets, but they werent UNDEAD, and they didnt have bulging eyes, and they
DIDNT go anywhere NEAR my kitchen.

the launch of these commercials added them to my list of restraunts I will
NEVER go to again. they are the second entry, first is a place called
Checkers.
More money for whataburger I suppose. im a big fattie that likes fast food:P


in closing, it wouldnt surprise me if within a year they went bankrupt.
people dont wanna have to wonder if thats really pepper in the pepper bar or
rat poop.
