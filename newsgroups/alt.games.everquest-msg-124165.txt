Hi Poul,

I certainly can't disagree with you, but I should have clarified that
compared with the effort involved, what you get is not that much better
than the raw silk items. Also, at the lower levels a Necro must
occasionally melee to give the pet an assist and the AC does help albeit
mot by much...
