Hi Lance,

You nailed it. It almost always happens when I'm on the horse. To add to
that, I have Levitate on so I get the bounce as well. I haven't tried zoning
because I'm in the middle of OoT and it's a long way to a zone. ;)

And I'm a mage too. So yep, there goes the pet, the pet armor, the pet
weapon, the pet buffs. Even with KEI, that's a lot to make up every 10
minutes. lol

Maybe they'll fix it in the next patch . . . okay the patch after that! ;)

Where do you hunt in Dulak's? I've heard that it's good hunting there, but
never been there. Is there any good 59 mage solo spots?

Thanks,

Mike W.
