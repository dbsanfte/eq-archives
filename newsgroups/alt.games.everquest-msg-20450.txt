After leveling into 38 today in OT I decided to play around
with MS1 a little.  I ended up with a Gargoyle.  Now, I know
that some mobs geometry is used in several zones with
different textures, and MS1 can get a mob with a texture from
a different zone.  Question is, what mob in the zone uses the
Gargoyle geometry, and is the texture the same?
