Right but I was comparing BST vrs SHM buffs not the two of them together,
which is why I didn't include BOAR over STAMINA in the BST equation.

Again was directly comparing BST to SHM in which case STA/IOS/SV/KRAGG gives
more HP then Fo7/BOAR

True enough in a party, I was comparing SHM to BST directly though assuming
no outside buffs.  In a perfect group I would take BSS/SoT as well over SV,
but still keep IOS/KRAGG/BOAR/DEX so that I get more HP and max my dex which
I wouldn't be able to do with Fo7/BOAR.  For those lucky individuals where
there DEX and STA is allready maxed, KRAGG + SV still will give more HP
overall then Fo7 obviously.  In the end what it comes down to for me is that
it's more important for me to get my DEX maxed then it is to save slots.  I
see a bigger difference with my dex at 280 so I'll always take my own buffs
over Fo7.

Cheers we agree here!
