This is not supposed to be a troll, though some will see it that way. It's
just letting people know.

according to these places:
(warning, SOE bashing ahead)

Sony has stopped any and all production/code fixes, etc... upon the Mac
version of EverQuest.

Server still there, you can still log in and play, and fwiw I understand you
can still purchase EQ for the mac, but you are dealing with a static world.
Bugs? Work around them because they will never be fixed? Content? You have
what you have.

A poor move by SoE, but I supposed everyone has had to tighten the belts a
little bit.

Mind you this still could be some sort of spoof by someone, but considering
that in at least one place I read they sold less than 2500 copies of EQ mac,
the only thing that surprises me is that SOE is leaving the server up, if
they are really freezing it. I wouldn't think that would be worth the money.
(just for the curious, there are less than 2000 posts on all the forums
(http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/eqmac/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi), though I
don't know how far back they go... I think my guild message board has more
than 2000 posts on it)


Anyway, thought you might find this informative.

P.S. 'Twink Different'... I like that.
