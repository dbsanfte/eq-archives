When I was a young ranger and stupid I always hit taunt, every time I could. 
(I read a "ranger guide" that instructed you to !!!!)
A kindly overworked cleric in High Hold Pass finally sent me a "/tell if you
don't quit taunting I'm going to kill you myself".   He's now a good friend and
gave me some great advise on playing more efficiently / effectively.  Turns out
he also has a high level ranger.
