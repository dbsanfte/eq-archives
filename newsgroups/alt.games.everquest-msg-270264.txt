No shock here - in chat it was mentioning something about a spell file 
that would cause a world-crash.  That would be shittier than downtime.

One of these fucking days they'll learn how to do farkin QA - yeah, I 
know - being hopeful.  But on the other hand - eq is a freaking monster 
of a app =)

I'm drinking beer now... I'm happy - let them patch.... as long as 
they're back up by tommorow night =)
