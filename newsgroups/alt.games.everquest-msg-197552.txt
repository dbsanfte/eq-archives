Because you are an enchanter - your healing options are limited. Bind
wounds - thats it. You should have a number of spells to allow you happily
evade the enemy, like mez, mem blur etc. Your pet at that level aint
great fine, but you do have a bunch of other spells. Notably charm. Dont
use the pet line of spells, charm a monster and set it on the others.

This is Crushbone here - its rare that you will find people high in level
wandering in the zone as it doesnt have much to attract. Its a busy zone
with mobs all over so people in a positino to help arent going to be
hugely common.....get into a group and they should be helping you but you 
also shouldnt be having to fight.

See charm note.

Well a pure caster is based heavily on their spells. So a full spell list
sohuld help

go to eq.crgaming.com - the enchanter sectino should cover more than you
need.
