Lower Guk is great because of the undead.  Make certain you have root up to
take care of wanderers, and that you have a few stuns up to help you deal
with casters.  At 52 you'll want to move to the Safe Hall and start taking
mobs beyond that.  The hallway leading up to the Ghoul Lord is ideal as it's
got a lot of dark blue mobs that are fairly easy to get single.

Another tip:  get an Anklesmasher if you can.  My 54 pally lives by this.
It's a Kunark-era 1HB that procs a snare.  So he swings with the 1HB until
he gets a snare proc, then switches to his two-handed weapons.

Another nice place to solo is Jaggedpine Forest.  Either the poachers or the
gnolls in the northern cave.  They're not undead, of course, so you'll have
to use Divine Might.  And they can cast and they run.  But they're
relatively easy kills.
