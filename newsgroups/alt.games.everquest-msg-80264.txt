Downloaded new drivers.....done.   Made sure LoadArmorNN=TRUE in every
numerical catagory...yup, already done.

Well, the new drivers helped stop the insane flickering.  I can now turn the
sky back on again.  Typing UseUmbra=FALSE made it so I can turn my clip
plane back up so I can see again......

But I'm not seeing any more clothes on the new Luclin models than what I did
before.....the new models that have anything less that ultra uber gear on
are still half naked.
