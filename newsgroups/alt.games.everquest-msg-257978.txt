   Ok, it's true I admit that I think of MMORPG in terms of being a game. 
That is what the "G" stands for, no?

   But I know.  I don't like being made to do busy work of running back and
forth for no apparent reason, that makes me a world destroyer.  Note, I am
not howling to have things changed, or shaking my fists at the devs.  I
just am irritated by it, is all.  Too bad I have to struggle with this
crushing non-understand for the reasons behind The Way Ben Says Things
Should Be.
