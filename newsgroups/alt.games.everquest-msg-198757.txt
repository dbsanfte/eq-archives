no

kei = luxury

50p is common on my server

to assume that 50p on fennin means the same as 50p on kb or wherever, than
100p on fennin would still be appropriate for kei, though i would assume it
would be extended kei

when i sell kei, i make damn sure i find a nice mage who will accept kei as
payment for a mantle....then he gets more kei, i get more customers, and my
customers get more kei

still, 50p or 100p, level 5 or level 50, kei is a luxury and should be
treated accordingly (no one needs it, they just think they do, its part of
the illusory powers we phantasmotastic folks get)
