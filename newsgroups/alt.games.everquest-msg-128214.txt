I've been in the tech support industry for about 15 years. Currently,
I work for an outsource tech support company. I support all kinds of
hardware and software from a variety of manufacturers. I have taken,
literally, tens of thousands of tech support calls on every type of
computer product and service imaginable. In all this time, after all
these calls, I have never encountered a stupid customer. I have,
however, encountered countless incompetent technicians.

Don't get me wrong. A person doesn't have to be competent to make a
good technician. You can throw a rock at Britney Spears concert and
the person you hit (in the head, hopefully) would make a fine tech.

Being a great tech, however, is a different matter. A high level of
technical competence is certainly required, but in addition one must
be very skilled at dealing with people. All kinds of people. Irate
customers, customers who are difficult to understand, those who are
not familiar with the systems they are using. They all require special
care and a skilled tech to deal with them. It's part of the job.

Part of my duties include monitoring the calls of other techs. I know
the techs stomping their feet or pounding their fists. The ones that
throw their chair or scatter a stack of papers all about. I've
listened to their calls. It's never the customer. It's always the
tech. The tech who can't handle the call.

The bottom line is: If you can't stand the heat, get out of the
kitchen.
