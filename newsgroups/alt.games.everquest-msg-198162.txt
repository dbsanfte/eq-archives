Rules for Wizard Soloing:

1.  Always have SOW.

The most important thing a Wizard needs to solo is SOW.  This means
you need a friendly druid/shaman (or Ranger/Beastlord).  With SOW, you
don't have to worry about the mob breaking root and beating on you. 
Also, buy a 10 dose potion of SOW in the bazaar and keep this for
emergencies (when SOW drops when your not expecting it).

2  Always have Gate.  If the shit hits the fan (and your SOW drops or
you are rooted), it can save you.  I don't bother with Shadow Step or
Yonder.  The couple of times I tried Yonder, it dumped me in the
middle of a bunch of KOS creatures = quick death.  Gate will always
get you back to a safe location (if it casts).

3.  Mana is life.  A wizard without Mana is like a Warrior without hit
points.
Sit as much as you can.  If your wealthy, buy a Horse.  Get KEI at the
Nexus or Bazaar.  Do the very easy POP quests for the Mana Preserve II
ring and the Spell Haste II Mask.

4.  Be watchful.  Learn to not use first person view much.  You don't
have a group to bail you out and if your sitting alot, you can aggro
wandering creatures.  Also, when your higher level and quadding, you
need to be skilled in using the 3rd person views.

5.  Invisible.  When your mana is almost gone and your looking at a 10
minute wait for it to come back, you can Invis yourself and sit.  Some
wandering creatures can see thru invis but many can't.  Once you get
your Translocate spells, you can drop it.  Simply bind yourself in a
safe place in the zone. Translocate to the Nexus.  Med to full. Gate
back.  The one advantage Wizards have over most other classes is
mobility.

The low level wizard is very tough to play. At 29th, your life gets
easier when you get Bonds of Force.
