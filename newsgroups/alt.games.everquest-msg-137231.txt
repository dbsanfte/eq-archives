Thank you Socrates, now go change your fucking diaper.

You don't know that for a fact fuckwit. Besides the individual who picked 
up the gear was working on the assumption, as he stated, that the goods
belonged to another player who was in the process of transferring the 
items. Believing that, there is no doubt he had two options one ethical
and moral with the obligation to attempt to return the goods, or to travel
the path of dishonor and theft. He chose the latter.

  You can rant until you're blue in the

Why ? Because you've presented evidence supporting your 
position so well ? 


Make an accusation like that on a public channel in-game and

In the words of that respected scholar Kaev, bullshit.

 Make an equivalent

lol, ya right. I guess it's tough to play the game with all the time 
you spend litigating libel and slander cases eh ?
