Have known that for a long time, but for full groups against tougher
mobs, the last two spots are genarlly filled with more melee damage
dealers, and/or wizard. Not more of the "less offensive" casters like
another druid and a shammy. That's the only part that was unusual to me.
One melee in a full group has not been the norm for us before.
Especially since the "one melee" in this question is me. As a warrrior,
I dish out less damage than any of the equal level monks and rogues in
our groups.
