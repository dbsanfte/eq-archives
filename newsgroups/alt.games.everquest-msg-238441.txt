Ooh ooh, we're talking about clothes! I'm in!

Unfortunately the end of my progression isn't so inspiring, because the
ranger ornate BP has a SUCKY effect.  My husband managed to get one for
his shaman, but I just focused on other pieces.

Anyhoo...what do I remember...hmmm....blue bamboo splint (I kid you not) -
mithril BP - ornate velium BP (I was doing the plate thang) - polished tin
mail (cuz it had a REALLY NEAT velious graphic) - tae ew chain. 

Oh gods, how boring is that. *sad sigh*  My pants are much, MUCH
cooler.  Finding plate graphic pants that a ranger could wear that weren't
a huge downgrade from hardened clay links or veteran's chain (and
maestro's pants weren't an option /sniff) was not easy, but AH LOVE MAH
Dark Master's Greaves.  I'd say they are my second favorite item, right
after my Sally.

OH! BTW, I don't think I ever shared this here.  In case anyone likes art
and remembers how much I loved getting my Sally from BoT...this is
another picture someone drew of Foxeye for me that I"m crazy about.
