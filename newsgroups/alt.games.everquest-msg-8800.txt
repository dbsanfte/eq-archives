For pulling purposes, damage isn't as important as distance.  Get
a bow with a decent range on it (I'd suggest something with at least
a range of 100) as well as arrows with range that matches the range
of your bow.  Unless you've a magical bow, the farthest that arrow
is going to travel is the lesser of the two ranges on the bow and
arrows you're using.

Not really.  The idea of using archery to pull a mob is to get its
attention OUTSIDE of melee range and bring it back to the group
without the puller getting chewed up on the way back, saving your 
healer valuable mana.  Any damage you do to a mob with the arrow is
a bonus.  :)

Whether you get a hit or miss message, as long as it knows you tried
to jab something hard into its ugly little rear, it will come.
