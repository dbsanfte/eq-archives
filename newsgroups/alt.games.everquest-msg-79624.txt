I went back there once, the elemental (named Jen'hadar or something similar)
killed me when I ran back out without invis, but he didn't see invis to go
in.

The "you cant reach..." message is NOT from something at the zone line, its
from the big circle right behind the elemental as you enter the lava filled
tunnel, if you invis up and go back there, you can click it.

As for actually going down there, I fire resist buffed, levitated and HP
buffed, but I still couldn't see anything down there before I got too burnt
to continue.
