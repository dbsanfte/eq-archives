If you have 15 classes equally split exactly how many clerics are you
supposed to have? Some groups shouldnt have clerics. I know that this is a
really nasty hard lump to swallow but is none the less true. Druids should
have a diffrent utility , they most certainly do not have more. A paladin
tanks and does dammage 80% as well a warrior and can do more thnigs as well.
Has this completely removed the need for a warrior? Or rather do some groups
still want the best possible choice instead of one that will sorta work and
we can make do with?

The whole problem now is that druids bring so much less utility than any
other choice that it is hard for them to find groups. I would indeed add
utility to a druid so that this was no longer quite so true. I would
similarly add utility to a shaman even though they are already balanced
simply because 15 classes need 3 real healer classes.
