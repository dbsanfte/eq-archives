Subject: lvl 50 + Druid LEV, SoE and Form of Howler Spells.

I'd appreciate input from other Druids regarding the subject spells, which one
you  prefer or would prefer to use etc.

It seems to me the NPC  drop LEV spell is redundant. SoE gives you LEV without
the need for bat wings plus See Invis and SoW which, seems to me to be a bit
faster than  the earlier SoW.  Also does Form of the Howler have a Mana regen
component?  With  WISDOM at 224, I really don't see that much, if any,
difference in mana regen rates.

Is there an obscure method to Verant's madness here, or simply a failure in the
*creative* lets give the 50+ Druid some useful spells department? The same
holds true for the high level EB spell? Is it worth all that bother to quest
after these spells simply to save two inventory slots for spell components? 

Perhaps when I'm at 60, completed my epic and bored to tears, I may quest after
them and sell them off. I understand the asking price for these two spells is
astronomical.
