Well, I did hate WordStar - mostly because of the way it saved text files,
and mad them difficult to export to other WPs, expecially with all the
non-english alphabet letters we have in Italian (and French). Once, I wrote
an article for a newspaper in WS and I couldn't deliver it until the
systemist there remembered some exotic conversion utility in Framework...
Must be a century ago...
