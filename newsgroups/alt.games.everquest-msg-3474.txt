Entered NK and noticed there a was green tint on everything in the
distance. I got a message that I felt itchy. A farmer shouted that a
plague was on the land thanks to Bertoxxulous (sp). Later I observed a
rabid griffawn, a mob I'd never seen before. Finally I observed a large
scarab beetle called a Spawn Mother surrounded by a bunch of tiny
hatchlings. It conned blue to me (a lvl 39 paladin) and attacked me
before I could decide whether I wanted to take it on alone or not. It
was a tough beast with high resists and I had to use Lay Hands. Even
then it was beating me down quickly so I had to cast Root four times
before it would stick so I could back off and heal. While I was healing,
a couple of other players showed up and finished off the Mother. Since I
had brought it down to about 25% health I got the exp (half a blue
bubble) and the loot, a ruby crown with no stats.

I can sell the crown to a vendor for 190pp. But is there some other use
for it?
