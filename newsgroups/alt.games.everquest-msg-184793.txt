Sea Fury cyclops would not be too bad. If the AC camp is open you can sit
there and have one of you pull SF's across while you wait for the AC.
Otherwise just go to OOT and kill the SF's. They drop gems semi-rarely. I
can usually get the same cash over a long haul as I would from HG's but
actually get xp.

Tash (so it hits chanter), darkness, pets, fear would work fine.

Plus if you do camp the AC get some jboots, or sell the MQ for about 3 - 5k
depending on your server.
