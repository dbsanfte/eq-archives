Got to agree with this.
Despite WOW's success, there is a lot of things wrong with it (tho they dont 
match the faults with EQ).
I can see WOW losing a large chunk of its playerbase when a new casual 
friends MMORPG comes out.

Despite its initial promises of catering to the casual player, and the 
delivering of that promise at lower levels, it fails horribly at high 
levels, and there are a lot of bored level 60's out there.
EQ made the mistake of not listening listening to the casuals and WOW is 
treading the same path.
