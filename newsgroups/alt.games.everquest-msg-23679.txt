I've tp'ed into Iceclad a hundred times and have never been attacked.
Even if you do, just kill the level 30 mob or run away since a druid
had to port you, you have a SOW anyway.

When I port low levels there, I invis them and tell them if we are
attacked to run away--I will hold them off then gate out. Never had to
do it though.
