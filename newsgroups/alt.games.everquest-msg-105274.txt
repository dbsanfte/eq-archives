Well it's not like game servers haven't been hacked before. Ever
played D2? They were DOS'ed all the time.

>Which is stupid.

How nice of you to say so.

Tapdancing nothing. I asked a question. Period. My internet access was
fine. Couldn't get to EQ/Sony stuff. I don't see you people jumping
all over people that just can't get logged on and it's patch day. Oh,
wait, yes I do. That's right. You jump all over people if they don't
know *every single* fucking thing that EQ/Sony is doing every moment
of every day. Too bad if someone has a real life and only has time to
game an hour or so a day and doesn't have time read all the websites
first. Damn them to hell right? Don't underestimate and think that
casual gamers aren't worthwhile. Without us where would EQ/Sony get
the money to keep the servers going? Oh, that's right, the addicts
wouldn't mind paying triple the monthly rates right?
