Ah I minsunderstood.  I'm suprised a drud/war/rog/ran wouldn't do well
there.  Maybe the druid's fault.  It's always the druid's fault anyway
:)  It can be pretty tough learning the crappy pathing, and if your
ranger isn't harmonying the right mobs, that can make things ugly.  So
it could be the ranger's fault.  - That's always the case.  If it's not
the druid's fault it's the ranger's fault.

I'ts unplesant if you like grouping though.  I have a really hard time
getting a group with my enchanter, even though I've been told repeatedly
I'm excellent.  I'm even having some trouble with my cleric!  I can
usually get a group with either about the time I have to log, when
people start logging on :(

I really need a longterm group to play with, but since I can't play on
weekends hardly ever, it's nearly impossible.  

Not to mention I keep quitting, er taking a break :)... Then my friend
calls me up and tells me about what he's doing in EQ and I get the spark
again.  Unfortunately he's only on when I have the least time too, in
the evening, which I have an hour or two at most.
