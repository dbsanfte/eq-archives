I too have had this happen and found it VERY frustrating. I had a half elf
Bard char (that I don't really play much anymore) and, on more then one
occasion had some other kind bard walk up and GIVE me armor that was for
bards and that said H/E (half elf) only to have the red "can not equip"
message. I reported the bug and no one ever got back to me, so I gave it to
another half elf bard who was able to use it. Oh well, you win some and you
lose some I guess.Better luck in the future.
