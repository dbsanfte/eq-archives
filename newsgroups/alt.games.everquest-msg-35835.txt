They both give infravision.
Greater just lasts longer, is higher speed, and is higher ATK bonus.
Beyond that, no difference.

Form of the Great Wolf (and higher) is where you get ultravision.

Combust - Better mana/damage ratio but fire based so fire immune mobs
will shrug it off without worry.

CL - Lower mana/damage ratio but magic based.  Magic immune mobs will
shrug that off.

As you get higher leveled, you'll realize resist checks on spells are
fairly critical when dealing with mobs.  Some will have low fire
resist, low cold resist, low magic resist etc...  You have to figure
out which they are vulnerable to and pick the correct nuke to use.
