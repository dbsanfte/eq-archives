Hehe, I got impatient and went to eqtraders.com and got all the info.

I figure I'll make a few of these for my friends ince I hit 160 or so
tailoring, sooner if they are impatient and collect the items
themselves.

The only thing slowing me is the sheer number of folks camping
crystaline silks sucks.  3 places that drop them is just cruel, and
having them such a low drop in Velketors is even worse.  I hear the
Velketors drop rate is upped, I sure hope so...

Sam / Kad 
still stuck at 115 tailoring after a few (successful) Crystaline silk
attempts...
