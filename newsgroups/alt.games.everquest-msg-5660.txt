If your pet takes a hit anytime during the first fight, back him off
*before* the
first mob goes down, then re-engage him it resets his hate list.  It can be
tough to disengage a pet from a mob long enough for a 'chanter to
re-establish
control, so you can't let him get it in his *very* little mind to go after
anything you
haven't explicitly told him to kill.
