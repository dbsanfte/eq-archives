    It's also the position of the designers of the game. Convincing them to
depart from this policy is what must be supported by argument, not "stay the
course". Given what will occur if the ZEMs are brought down (people killing
the lowest blues they can find, as fast as possible) was something that the
game designers specifically did NOT want to happen, I don't see any
compelling reason to do what you want done.
