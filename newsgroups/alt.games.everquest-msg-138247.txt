Just tried quadding the walruses last night.  With 179 Int. at lvl 34,
I couldnt quiet take them down.  However it was close enough that if I
had a staff of temperate flux to lower thier resists, I think I could
get them.  Still be touch and go.

Lightcrawlers in Dawnshroud were fairly easy and still good for 1/3rd
a yellow bubble even if you got a light blue into the mix.  Careful
where you run though, You could get a train of extra crawlers or a
pack of shroons following you.  A real good place to train this skill
even if it not the best place overall.
