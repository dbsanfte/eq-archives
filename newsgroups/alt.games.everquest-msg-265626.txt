Lag and frame rate issues do not require instancing to solve, nor is
instancing sufficient - if 400 people gather in the same spot, then
you will get frame rate problems if they're all shown on screen.  And
while it may fix general overcrowding, if you have static spawn spots,
you will still get competition over them - consider Bob Perez'
description of the undead pirate (I think it was) on the Isle of
Refuge, for instance, which is an instanced zone in Everquest 2 but
still has camp fights.

However, that kind of instancing isn't so much of a problem as the
instancing Bartle is opposing, I think - the big problem, in terms of
socialization, is with instances which hold only a single group.
Having multiple instances of a shared zone still encourages
socialization with random strangers, it's more of an immersion breaker
("Hey, come to Antonica, we're killing stags" "I'm in Antonica, I
don't see you" "Oh, we're in Antonica 3").
