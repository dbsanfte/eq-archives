Not even close to the same thing.    While there isn't much of a per tick
difference between C2 (11 mana/tick) and KEI (15 mana/tick), the real killer
is the duration.

KEI has a base duration of 150 minutes, and with AA's can last much longer
than that.   (I believe I've seen close to 4 hours (240 mins) advertised,
although due to my main classes I havne't payed *that* close of attention to
it.)

C2 has a base duration of 35 minutes.    Even assuming similar extended
AA's, and smart bind locations, you're not going to be soloing very fast if
you have to stop and run to PoK every 45 mins for a C2 refresh.   Not many
good hunting areas for a level 41 player with a PoK book in the same zone.
