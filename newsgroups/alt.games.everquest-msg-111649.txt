There are 2 low level Bard slows. Largos is aoe
and tends to pull mobs at inopportune moments
(particularly indoors). Selo's is a slow/snare
combo. It doesn't stack with any other snare.
Neither stacks with any other slow. Neither of
them use mana though.

I am not saying they should not be used, just
that their use is very much situational.
I have a theory, it could be bunnies....
