I wonder if this is just a problem for people who got SoL right away?
I bought it yesterday (Dec 9, 2001), and it defaulted to installing in
"C:\Program Files\Everquest", right where my other Everquest stuff is.

Perhaps it does look for something, and they pushed that something out
in one of the patches last week, so those of us who played some EQ
after SoL came out but before we installed it do not have the problem?
