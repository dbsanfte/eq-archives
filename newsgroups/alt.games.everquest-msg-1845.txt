	I missed the original somehow.

	I'm currently in Eastern Wastes, fearkiting like crazy.  The place is
still loaded down with blue animals -- Savage Dire Wolves (mostly green but
still some blues left), Wooly Mammoths (ditto), Tundra Mammoths, Wooly Rhinos,
Snow Griffs.  The last three are starting to green out but I'm told you can
hunt profitably here until L53, and there are still a few blue targets at L54.

	The Ulthorks are also in East Wastes, not Great Divide, and they're almost
all green.  The Man-o-Wars aren't, but they're VERY tough and not worth the
effort.
