I have an Athlon 1800 (basically equivalent to a Pent IV 1.8MHz) with 512
RAM and the GeForce 3Ti 500 graphics card, SB Audigy sound card and I still
get jumps and freezes.  Have everything installed correctly, etc.  I do run
Luclin, so that is a lot of it, but the game just takes a lot of umph to run
it seems.  (I don't think umph is a technical term in computer land, but
thought I'd use it anyway).

A lot of it might just be the way EQ is designed.  When programs are written
they often don't allocate memory and resources correctly and sometimes freak
out even on a fast machine.  Back in the day this old shareware game called
Scorched Earth ran just as fast on a Pentium 250 as it did on my friends
486.  Rather to say it ran just as slow.  Just goofy programmers I guess.
Maybe EQ2 will be better.
