Indeed, I have had the same thing happen to me many times, and I tend to
*not* group, preferring solo play at about a 75/25 ratio. Yet there have
been numerous occasions when I have helped out somebody because I recognized
their name as being a good person from the past, and vice versa.

What goes around comes around is quite the reality in Norrath.
