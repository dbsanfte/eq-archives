Scalping is done legaly and in every state of the union. Just include
a service in the fee and presto you can charge what you wish. Ever see
those Super Bowl packages that include some simple service sell for
thousands of dollars? What do you think is going on here? Scalping.
Yantis is charging for the service not the plat so is indeed legal.
Wonder why thats so hard for yall to see?
