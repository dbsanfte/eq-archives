There are 2 ways to effectively solo for a necro:

1. fear kiting. Darkness on the mob to pull. sic the pet then fear the mob.
Drop any other dots you got on the mob and recast fear and darkness when
needed (preferably time it so you reapply just before it wears off).

2. root-dot. The name says it all, you pull with darkness again, run it to a
spot where you don't expect adds, root it and drop every dot you have on it.
Don't use a pet here because it will die anyway. recast dots and root when
needed.

Fear kiting is usually preferred when there is room because the pet is
usually good for loads of damage
