You may have your kunark files in a different folder. Make sure that you 
   have all the game expansions in the same folder. If you reloaded the 
game, when loading  it may have put kunark in  a /sony/everquest  folder 
   instead of  just /everquest  folder.  Its something like that, anyway 
  good luck.
