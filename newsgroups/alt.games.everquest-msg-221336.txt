thats exactly what i mean.  it might suck, but it turns it into a level 
of super mario brothers if you can fight to the boss, die, and in 15 
minutes essentially start over with only a minimal penalty.  death 
should carry with it a much larger penalty.  if you want to get back the 
exp, or to continue playing at the level you were prior to the death, 
get a necro, get a cleric, whatever you need to do to get it done.  

corpse recovery is an important part of the game...letting corpses pop 
outside in 15 minutes reduces it to the point of being trivial
