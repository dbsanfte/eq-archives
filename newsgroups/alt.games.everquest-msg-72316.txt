inventory, its like got all my stuff but like in a black table, not the nice
old blue squares lay out. Up side is u can see thru table so nothing sneaks
up, but i hate look of it. If u right click an object text overlaps onto ur
money bar so text is messed up as backgrounds are like smokey colour almost
transparent. can u revert to old, pre velious display?

YOU PEOPLE ARE RIDICULOUS! Has it not occurred to you that perhaps this
person may be new to Usenet? Perhaps he's not all that versed in computer
use, and thus doesn't know the difference between HTML and plain text, or
how to set it up to send in plain text. Your flames could mean nothing to
him because he doesn't know what HTML is!

And that doesn't make him stupid. He just never learned like we did. Give
people a chance for chrissake!

And for God's sake his message wasn't that hard to read. I got it just fine.
My Reader interprets HTML for me. If yours doesn't, then PLEASE get a news
reader that does! Its fucking 2001 (almost 2002), stop using software that
acts like it's 1985!

Its just Usenet, and please don't forget the internet is a FREE PLACE!
People can do whatever they want. If he wants to post in HTML, there's NO
LAW AGAINST IT! If you can't deal with it because your anal-retentive about
everything then just DON'T FUCKING READ IT.
