FV is very underpopulated, but then its a special server with special rules,
and most people dont like it, so no surprise there.
As for the other servers, you can still list them in population rank. The
rathe server doesnt have so many people on it since it was split.
On a wider note, overcrowding isnt really an isssue if you just want to
train. The best zones for levelling (loio, OT, DL) in pick up groups,
support *heaps* of people. OT can have over 100 people in it easily, without
any overcrowding. Personally I'd pick a server with a lot of people on it.
Its finding groups that is harder now than finding a place to solo, but
stick around those zones I listed, and you wont have too many problems.
