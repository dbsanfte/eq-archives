Why?  They probably assumed (without giving it a thought, just like "real
people") that everyone agreed with them (I certainly do)
that...well...you're not fighting, why would you want more screen clutter?

But yeah, some people LOVE screen clutter for no freaking reason, so I think
it was a good idea to add...but I don't see how they would have known there
were going to be that many complainers.

As for /hitsmode, MY biggest complain is that the damned documentation
provides NOT EVEN ONE FUCKING FORMATTING EXAMPLE.  Not a big deal if you
read technical manuals regularly, but most players don't (I don't).  It took
me over an hour to get the damned thing working.  Then, once it was, I
created a macro because every guild member who logged on asked how to work
the damned thing.

Would have been nice to get more /chat examples in the dox, but it was only
annoying to learn, not downright frustrating.
