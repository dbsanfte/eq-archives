Since I"m spending time in Stonebrunt (by the way, nice XP... I wonder if 
it's a bonus area), I decided to do the WoFS quest. I got the Tiger Skins 
and Panda Claws, and I know I'm supposed to get the poison sacs from 
Cistern Asps in Oasis, but for the life of me I don't seem to be able to 
forage the Fruit and Bamboo shots, in spite of my high foraging skill.

Anybody else having problems with this part of the quest?
