I've had something similar happen.  Up/Down arrow keys scroll the
chat window instead of making my char walk; left/right arrow keys
do nothing.  Enter will not bring up the chat window.  Hotkeys (like
H for Hail and C for /consider) stop working too.

First time it happened was on a laptop about 8-10 months ago.  At the
time I assumed it was something to do with the wireless keyboard/mouse
setup on the laptop.  But it has started happening on my desktop
PC too.
