I'll admit this is a great druidic benefit (friends are talking about
teaching me how to kite now *shudder*) but on the other hand, a root
dotting druid medding during a fight will take one hell of a long time
to kill a mob. The medding a wizard does after a fight, a druid does
while the dots work. Our dots are the only spells we have that deal
damage comparable to that of wizard nukes, and we have stacking issues
with them - we can only stack 2 lines until high levels, and one of
them is highly resisted :)
