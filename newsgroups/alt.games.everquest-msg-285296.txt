digital download is really a misnomer.  after your account is flagged for 
the expansion, all you really need is the patcher*.  don't bother 
installing more than one full version of EQ.  Only install the latest full 
version you have, I have the disks for PoP, that's what I usually use to 
reinstall.  Make sure all the expansions you have paid for are checked off 
on the advanced options on the patcher and all the files you need will be 
downloaded.  No matter if you install everything or not you'll still have 
the same monster of a download.

*I have gotten EQ started back up with just a copy of the patcher and 
everquest.exe, it takes the same amount of time too.
