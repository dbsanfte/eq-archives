Heh, playing a shaman you get used to people making up fantasy numbers
when it comes to one's mana regen.

I don't really have a good grasp on Mage DPS but if the number I've
heard quoted for high end pets (90 DPS) is close, I don't think mages
have to worry too much about loosing their spot as one of the best DPS
classes out there. Over the course of an hour (since nobody fight
non-stop), odds are you'll still be pretty competetive with rogues. I
hope so anyway, mages really do need to be one of the premier DPS
classes out there.
