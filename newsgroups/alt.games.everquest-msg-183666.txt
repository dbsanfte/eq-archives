Well, I have changed my "/auc Human GM smith taking orders on Heraldic... "
message to include the fact that Heraldic armor can be worn by Frogluks.  =)

However, since Heraldic has a recommended level of 45, it will be a few days
at least.  I created a frogluk pally and had him try on a piece of Luminant.
A 30 AC / 30 HP / 30 MANA item became a 1 AC / 1 HP / 1 MANA item on a
third-level froggie.

Ah well.  I do think the market will pick up eventually.  I expect to have
my first froggie sale shortly.  =)
