It has been stated officially that current skill level is the principle
factor
in determing success or failure. Some tradeskills have a secondary stat
which
takes a minor role in that calculation. Smithing uses strength;
fletching (and,
according to rumor and my own experience, pottery and tailoring) uses
dexterity.
Current skill, secondary stat (if used by the skill) and the random
number
generator: these and these alone determine the success or failure of any
given
attempt.

It has been stated officially that the higher of WIS or INT will
determine how
fast you see skill ups IN TRADESKILLS (weapon skills use, I think,
agility.) It
does not matter which one; if one is 150 and the other only 75, then the
game
engine will calculate success using the 150 stat, regardless. Charisma
has no
effect whatsoever in either skill ups or success.

It has been stated officially that the presence or absense of a book has
no
bearing at all with skill ups or success. If you have it open in front
of you,
if you have it in your character inventory, in the bank or not at all...
no
difference.

The random number generator plays heavily in determing when skill ups
occure and
whether or not a given attempt will succeed. Yes, you will see long
stretches of
failure followed by stretches of successes, but you will see the exact
same kind
of stretches at dice or roulette.

Another factor in determing skill ups is your current level when the
attempt is
made. For any skill, it is much easier to go from skill 10 to skill 11
than it
is to go from skill 200 to 201. Each skill has its own 'gradient'; 100
to 101 in
smithing appears to be harder than 100 to 101 in pottery, for example.
This
formula appears to break when you make an attempt with a skill of 0; 0
to 1
seems more difficult than 1 to 2.

The higher of wisdom or intelligence, your current skill level and the
random
number generator: these and these alone determine the chance of a skill
up with
any given attempt.

There is ALWAYS a chance of failure. When your skill = trival for the
item you
are making, you seem to have about a 20% chance of failing. When your
skill
reaches about 133% of the trivial level with most items, it seems to
drop to
about a 3% chance of failing.

Some items seem to have a significantly higher native fail rate (like
padding)
and others have a significantly lower fail rate (like silk swatches.)  I
have
never seen silk swatches fail, but I seemed to be about tailoring (90),
or 300%
trivial, before the failure on padding leveled out to 3%. Both of these
results
is in line with what other tailors have told me, but again: that pesky
random
number generator has a lot to say in the matter. It IS possible for 00
to show
up five times in a row on the roulette wheel; it is possible to fail
five times
in a row making leather padding with a tailoring skill of 150.
