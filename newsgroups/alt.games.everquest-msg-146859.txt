yeah, i got one of them too.  I left Allakhazam's site up one time when 
had to go cook dinner.  When I came back there was a new icon on the 
systray.  I yelled at my kid, I thought he did something to allow the 
installation(he was sitting in the seat but didn't touch the keyboard 
the whole time.)  It had to be from alla's site because that was the 
only browser window open.  Fired off an email to him and got a polite 
apology that actually said "I have no control over the ads, so stuff it 
or pay for the site"  No plans at the moment to send in any money, and 
scumware don't help me to make up my mind any faster.
