I'm afraid you'll have to be more specific than that.   ; )

I'm assuming you mean the Aid Grimmel quest of tradeskill massochism.   It
would qualify as an uber item that she could one group to eventaully...
except that you need to raid enough to be _Elemental flagged_ to finish it.

Let me quote a post I made on our guild boards.

Looking at the raid requirements for Aid Grimmel.

To start the first one (smithing), you need to be Grummus and Bertoxx
flagged.

To start the second one (brewing), you need to be Terris Thule flagged.

To start the third one (jewelcraft), you need to be Saryn flagged.

To start the fourth one (pottery),  you need to have trials in Justice done.
Its now that they start getting decent.  8 all stats, 3 all resists, 35 hp /
mana.

To start the fifth one (tailoring), you need to be flagged for Plane of Fire
by killing Solusek Ro. (12 all stats, 7 all resists, 75 hp / mana)

To start the sixth one (fletching), you need to be elemental flagged as
having killed Rallos Zek.  (15 all stats, 10 all resists, 100 hp/mana, Regen
III)   Drops are needed from Plane of Air.  No idea if they are tradeable or
not.

To start the seventh one (baking), you need to be elemental flagged as
having killed Rallos Zek.  (17 all stats, 12 all resists, 115 hp/mana, Regen
V)

For the final one you need a rare drop from the elemental planes.  Reward
(for druids) is 25 all stats, 15 all resists, 130 hp, 150 mana, FT 3, Focus
effect 15% cheaper to cast all non CH spells.

I don't speak for anyone else in this thread, but this is actually a pretty
good example of what I have been talking about.   This earring quest is a
one groupable upgrade, although it's a _lot_ of work... but your "casual"
player cannot do it, becuase this one group content is locked away behind
multiple _raid_ flags.


That really is the point of this for me.    Sony appears to have drawn a
line in the sand, and pronounced "Beyond this point, you must raid to
continue."  Then added a significant amount of _one group_ content past that
which our group will never be able to get to.   Either it requires the
actual raid flags themselves, or it takes gear found only in those flagged
zones to be able to zone in without dying instantly.

Would I be willing to gear up on rare drops in the elemental planes, even
though it would be more work and take a lot longer than raiding for the
gear, until I was able to tank GoD content decently and then progress slowly
through the single group content in that expansion?  Absolutely.  Sounds
like the kind of game that I want to play.    But it is not allowed in
current EQ as an acceptable playstyle.
