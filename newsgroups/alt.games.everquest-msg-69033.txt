LOL!  I don't believe this!  *throws hands up in air*

I have looked for her each and every time I've gone through QH and have
NEVER, I mean EVER seen her on track or otherwise.  I've hung out at ruins
and killed everything in my path waiting for her and never have I seen a
hair or fingernail of her...

I have no idea if I can take her at lvl 24, my guess is NOT!  LOL  but it's
only xp and would be fun dying trying to take her.

Oh, and as for pets...  The pet will probably stick around after she is
dead.  Tovax's pet stays as does the 'Euridite Traveller' and all other
caster pets I've ever encountered.

Good luck to you and if you do take her out with your Necro, please post
again and let us know...

Be well!
