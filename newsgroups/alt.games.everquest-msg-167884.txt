My girlfriend and I are starting two characters on Firiona Vie (for a change
in play style and a nice chance to get away from it all), a Dark Elf
Enchanter (me) named Terulef (which is an anagram for True Elf, got
creative, what can I say?) and a Dark Elf Cleric (not sure of the name yet).
We plan on duoing to 10 (normally doable by just about any single class,
etc) but after that we will of course need a group.  On any other server I'm
sure a Cleric/Enchanter would be picked up into a group rather quickly, but
the problem occurred to me last night as I was falling asleep.....

With the language barrier, two dark elves won't be understood by the
majority of people in certain zones.  I had thought about going to Kurn's
since both Enchanter and Cleric are a rarity there since the Iksar can't
form those classes (something I had wished I had done with my own cleric
back in the day), but Iksar don't speak Dark Elf and vice versa.  Is there a
Dark Tongue that both races get naturally at around 50 or so possibly, so at
least we'd be sort of understood?  Or are there other zones that Dark Elves
tend to congregate or at least someone that would understand us?  Any ideas
here would be most helpful.

Also, I know that FV is a server where a guild can be very important, so any
recommendations for an evil raced guild, or should we just wait until the
later levels?  If I had more time to commit, I'd love to form a Dark Elf
only guild named True Elves of Norrath, with a bunch of delusional DE's
believing that the other elves in the world are an abomination, but the idea
of being a guild leader still scares the bejeezus out of me.  :)

Also, my enchanter is of course Agnostic, but if I take tons of faction hits
against a certain race/city, will illusion make me look to the guards like
some other guy rather than that evil bastard that killed his brother in the
war?

Any recommendations, caveats, etc for playing on this server would be most
appreciated.  Sorry about all the questions, I really appreciate whatever
responses I may get.
