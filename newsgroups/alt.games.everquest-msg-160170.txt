I'm just curious, is it true that beastlords don't have to worry about
getting aggroed by ANY animals?  I was just reading some message board
where somebody said they were playing their beastlord in the mudpit
area of the Overthere and how nice it was because the only thing that
he had to worry about aggroing him was the Sarnaks, even with the
patch that made Kunark mobs start aggroing (before it used to be that
sabertooths, rhinos, etc. would have the "scowl" message but didn't
aggro, but now they do). 

So, for example, a beastlord could be in EC and have a griffin flying
right over their head and not get attacked because griffins are
animals?

(I started a barbarian BL just out of curiosity and was surprised when
I saw a polar bear cub walk right by me and found out I was amiable!)

Anyway, thanks in advance,
