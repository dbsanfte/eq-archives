<snip>

I got another dropped quest on the Isle a few days ago, while playing
with a new character.  I completed the quest, and got a nice helmet as
a reward.

I have to say, these random quests, and the collection quests, are a
fun thing for me - I like the randomness of them, as opposed to the
static nature of all the other quests.

Can't wait for retail - beta is fun, but it's got to the point where
I'm reluctant to put any more time into my main character (now 13/13)
as she's getting wiped in a week or so.

On the upside, I've created 3 other characters, and have been having
fun exploring the Isle with them.

I think my alt will be a Warrior - they're good fun, so far.

And I think he'll be a furniture maker...

And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
