Several months ago I started a female ogre SK.  It was an experiment, I
wanted to see how fast a "strong" race could level and I wanted to check out
the scenery in Feerrott.  Months later she had never made it past level two,
but I found a few warrior type items in my posession and decided to pass
them on to her.  More of the experiment you know.  How much faster can a
twinked (well sorta twinked) character level?

Well, I have to tell you that playing her has been easy as she has been able
to solo to level 9 with very little trouble.  But the really fun part has
been playing dress-up with her.  One of the items I gave her is the Chitin
BP that drops in Netherbian.  On her it looks like a chest plate with skulls
where her breasts would be and stops at her waist (doesn't hang down like a
tunic).  She didn't have any pants at all, so the fur poking out under the
BP looked pretty funny.  Then some nice guy gave her some Rygorr leggings
and this is where things got interesting.  I put them on her and they look
like sheer chainmail.  What a Sight!

Well of course with her new clothes I had to give her a makeover.  I fixed
her hair and put a bone in it-made it white-I thought that looked cool.  I
picked a face with blue above her eyes clicked ACCEPT and VIOLA!  Now she
looks like a really, really ugly streetwalker with bleached blonde hair and
blue eyeshadow.  I think that any character that looks this bad should get
an automatic "fear"  I know she would scare me if I saw her in a dark alley!

I can hardly stop laughing long enough to play her.
