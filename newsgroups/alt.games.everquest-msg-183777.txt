    No. Especially in the 40's, the skills that are lagging catch up. And
DEF is usually better on a PL'ed character.

    Not really. Think about how quickly your weapon skills cap after you
ding. And most PL'ed twinks are given fast weapons so they can score that
one point of damage quickly before the damage shield kills the mob.

    Efficient can't really be argued. Level 60 in a week is faster than
doing it normally by severalfold. Fun is relative. Some folks don't have fun
except against the higher-level content. They don't want to spend a week
hitting bats, spiders, orcs and crocs.

    Casters aren't. How many mages, say, do you know that get pounded on a
lot when levelling up? A PL'ed mage is standing in the middle of a crowd of
yellows that are all beating on him with glee. DEF goes up fast in a
situation like that. What usually lags for casters is spell skills, because
they can't exactly get off spells in situations like that (and aren't
encouraged to except to pull, as they need to do that one point of damage to
get kill credit). But you can get spell skills up just by sitting around and
chain-casting a low mana spell, and with high INT/WIS the skill is going to
shoot up quickly.

    X isn't very big. This only hurts classes with a lot of weapon skills to
learn.

    This X is satisfied very quickly with stuff beating on you at all times.

    And this can be done quickly as well, especially if you can get a bard
to AFK manasong you.
