A character who is in their 50s with only 10 days /played can EASILY be
considered PLed, by whatever means.  Ten days is nothing.  It's just a drop
in the bucket compared to those who did it the "right way" (per Verant's
"Vision" <tm>).  I got my enchanter up to 50 in less than 30 days, and that
was twinked.

TEN DAYS to get to 50 and you don't call that POWER-LEVELED???

No, you're right, giving a newbie a 50kp item (last I knew from my server,
but I don't keep up with stuff I'll never be able to afford) isn't as fast
as having a druid PL them to 40, and a shaman or cleric take over from
there.  But hell yeah it's PLing anyway.

BTW, I have NOTHING against PLing and twinking as long as the twinky keeps
his skills up and knows his role in a group.
