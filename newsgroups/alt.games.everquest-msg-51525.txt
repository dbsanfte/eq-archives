What an awful camp! Camped it 24/7 for 3 days and got both the live and dead
versions. The dead one was up after 3 hours and 36 minutes after I killed
the PH then I spent the next few days sleeping in between spawn times.
Killed the PH 12 times before I got the live one to spawn. Then the bitch of
it all - a guild mate was helping and brought his lvl 10 twink cleric over
and we got him the parts in less than one day! Oh well, its a horrible camp
but well worth it, I will wear it as a badge of honor so to speak, I know
many 60th lvl clerics who did not have the patience to camp it and the ones
that have it still wear it proudly.

BTW, once a live or dead version spawns the same version seems to spawn
repeatedly for several spawns, good time to outfit your cleric and pally
friends with this shield.
