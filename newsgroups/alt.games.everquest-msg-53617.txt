Hate has changed since they opened the second floor, and the old tactics
don't work as well anymore.

It used to be that we'd run on top of the wall to the southwest corner, and
break there.

Now we break at zone-in.  Everyone stays there, and the pullers run out and
pull to zone-in.  Works much better.
