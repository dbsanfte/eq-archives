Well, there USED to be respect on Prexus.  Then this guild called
'Stasis' came along and decided their desire for phat lewt was more
important than the server-wide consensus and cooperative agreements
regarding rotations of certain highly-contested mobs, and calendar
reservations of some of the planes.  Since the 'rotationslaying' by
Stasis, it seems that a lot of high-end raids turn into free-for-all
KS-fests and shouting matches between guilds that USED to be on good
terms.

Oh, wait!  Stasis is YOUR guild, isn't it?

Never mind.

>/rude that gm.

/cheer that gm  (in the unlikely event that he actually did anything.)


>thanks for spoiling everybody in my guilds day asshole

And thanks for making the day of everyone who has been screwed by
Stasis.
