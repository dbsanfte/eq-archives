You can't buff mobs unless you have charmed them.  There are some
other things you can do to screw up people who are stealing your
camp, but all of them are frowned upon.  The PnP policy denies the
existence of the camping ettiquette that almost all players follow,
but does -not- deny the existence of means such as you are considering,
so the pigs who come and steal your camp can invoke it gleefully to
get you stomped if you try to interfere with them doing so.

PnP says you must share any spawn.  Also supported to some
extent is a "first to engage" policy, whereby if you have done
visible damage to a mob and are on its hate list, then you own
it.  Good luck finding evidence that this has happened, though,
your only real chance at that would be to have a GM watching,
invisible, to see it go down.
