Virus Characteristics
This is a trojan horse, not a virus.
This trojan is an infinite loop in JavaScript embedded in HTML. It has often
been posted to newsgroups in a HTML message.
Loop means it executes the same action over and over without stopping. They
usually repeatedly open new browser Windows until the script is stopped or
the computer crashes.
Another kind displays a message box repeatedly, usually a hoax like:
** WARNING ** Windows has detected the alt.config virus on your hard drive.
If you have recently opened an email or newsgroup message and see this alert
your system is infected.
There is no alt.config virus. alt.config is a legitimate newsgroup.
Newsgroup messages which contain the JS/Loop trojan are usually forgeries.
The From line is faked in order to get it to look like the message came from
someone the real poster doesn't like. The current wave of JS/Loop postings
(Oct 2001) are being posted to get back at some users of the alt.config
newsgroup. The forger posts in the name of an alt.config regular, usually
crossposted to alt.config plus several unrelated newsgroups.
Since this trojan is usually downloaded from Newsgroups and immediately
displayed and run, there will probably not be any files containing this
trojan on your computer, even if you were affected by it (but it is
sometimes possible to find it in "Temporary Internet Files"). JS/Loop does
not try it install itself on your computer or have any permanent effects.
But it may force you to perform an unexpected reboot, and you may lose
unsaved data that way.
It is best to avoid JS/Loop altogether by using a text-only newsreader, or
if you are using Outlook Express, disable "Active Scripting" in the
"Restricted Sites" zone and set NewsGroups to run in the "Restricted Sites"
zone. To do this:
-open Internet Explorer
-choose the Tools menu
-choose Internet Options
-click the Security tab
-click the Restricted Sites icon
-click "Custom Level"
-scroll down to "Active Scripting" and set it to Disable or Prompt
-Click OK
-open Outlook Express
-choose the Tools menu
-choose Options
-click the Security Tab
-In the "Security Zones" section, choose the "Restricted Sites" zone

Method Of Infection
This threat often exists as embedded javascript. Viewing a web page,
newsgroup, or email message can cause this trojan to drop its payload.
