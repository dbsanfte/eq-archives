Hi there, 

I don't agree with what this cleric did, BUT

I don't see why people in this thread are speaking of this
entrepreneurial cleric so harshly. It was that cleric's choice to
"charge more" for their services. Maybe the cleric preferred solo-ing
to group play, and that was her way of making it worth her while.

I wouldn't ask for more than my share, apparently the other people in
this thread wouldn't ask for more than their share, but what's the big
deal? The party did not agree to the cleric's terms and so no harm no
foul.

If however the cleric proceeded to be rude or hostile after the party
refused her terms, that would be unfortunate and worthy of the
responses in this thread.

Respecfully
Brad
