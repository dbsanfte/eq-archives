Well, you could try Sand Giants in Oasis and SRo, but they soak up all the
mana you got so killing goes slow and exp is not all that well on them.

Cougars in Iceclad are probably a good choice and so are the tentacles in
Crystal Caverns, to name a few.

If you got some more time I would suggest Guk or SolB for some serious
grouping action. Also
velious has many options open for a 40ties group.

I personally am just cleaning Runnyeye right now for some easy cash on the
drops there, but I'm moving to Velious coming weekend.
