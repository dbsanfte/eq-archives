I don't know if this is true, but think about this: let's say a mob is worth
5347 points of XP, if you put AA XP to 50%, the amount becomes 2673.5 points
into AA. The question is how the engine handles the 0.5 points whether is
rounds up or simply deletes it, and I can't answer that, but you get my
point, right?

Run 3 is a must, get that first. I wouldn't bother with stat AA's, not when
you're starting out anyway. I recommend Regen 3 or Metabolism 3. The more
HP's you can regen per tick, the better (this is why the Fungus Encrusted
Tunic is so expensive). Metabolism means you eat food less often, but this
isn't such an issue if you make your own food.

About AA's in general, this is what has worked for me: I almost* always had
AA xp at 0% because I wanted 65 as fast as possible. *: almost because
during raids, the xp was so minimal I put it into AA. After a grip and a
half of raids I accumulated I think 4 AA's (and some free AA's from POP
mobs). My point is, I got 65 first, then started getting AA's.

Run speed AA's dont stack with sow or shrew, or any movement buffs.
