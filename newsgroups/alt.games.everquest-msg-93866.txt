"N"orth.  (You're kicking yourself right now, right?)

If you haven't soloed getting to 51, why would you start?  Shaman is a great
ranger partner.  Druid is actually a pretty bad choice cause you have the
utility of a druid already, and they'd be hard pressed to keep a tanking
ranger alive.  If you want to solo, find animals.  Eastern Wastes is a good
place to start looking.  Fear is your friend, cause tanking sure isn't.

>Is Call of Flame worth questing for?

Depends on how good your equipment is.  My ranger outdamages call of flame
by just continuing to attack rather than cast the spell.  It has its uses,
though.
