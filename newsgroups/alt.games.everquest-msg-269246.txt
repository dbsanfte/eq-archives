Until recently I could get temp and sow under 15 minutes of
waiting... not anymore. I rarely had to wait 30 minutes for either.

Friday morning on Stromm was a team of 2 buffers, one for sow and
one for temp. Both over by nexus stone.

I found them after trying for temp and sow over a 30-40 minute time
period. I don't continuously do a /ooc, but I wait and see if
someone volunteers via /ooc to cast buffs. I have been getting a few
more /tells than usual by someone willing to do buffs, but not by
letting everyone know when they use /ooc.

I have gone that route a few times recently... its not a temp, but
it helps.

The results of /who are very interesting. More anonymous and more
lower level 'toons.
