New drug could help treat MS and Crohn's
A new type of experimental drug appears promising for treating two
devastating illnesses caused by the immune system attacking parts of the
body: multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease.
The drug, called Antegren, significantly reduced the number of new brain
lesions and relapses in patients with multiple sclerosis, and improved the
conditions of patients with Crohn's, an intestinal disease, according to two
new studies published together today.
Probably has more of a chance of causing these diseases than a placebo.
MASSACHUSETTS
Lab accused of coverup in missile-defense studies
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is looking into accusations that
its premier laboratory lied to cover up serious problems with the technology
at the heart of the administration's proposed missile-defense system.
The university was prodded to act by Theodore Postol, a tenured MIT
physicist in security studies and a critic of the anti-missile plan.
In letters to Congress, he has said MIT appeared to be hiding evidence of
serious flaws in the nation's main anti-missile weapon, a ground-based
rocket meant to destroy enemy warheads by impact.
What a noble act of truth and honesty, oh let's give him the nobel prize.
WEST VIRGINIA
Surgeons protesting high cost of insurance
Almost all surgeries were canceled at four West Virginia hospitals,
beginning Wednesday, as more than two dozen surgeons began a protest of the
high cost of malpractice insurance.
The West Virginia surgeons complain that their state has done too little to
address their rising insurance costs. Their protest was in the form of
leaves of absence.
What is the hippocratic oath? Something to set your decanter of fine brandy
upon as you sit in the yacht club with your luciferian order and laugh at
all the people who died because they didn't get some piddling operation?
FLORIDA
Tennessee Sen. Frist aids victims after car rollover
Incoming Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist stopped minutes after a car
accident on a Florida highway Wednesday, helping tend to the four survivors
until paramedics arrived.
Frist, a surgeon, was about 35 miles from Miami and heading to a family
vacation home when a sport-utility vehicle rolled over, throwing out all six
passengers. The senator helped paramedics stabilize the victims.
What a hero! That is exceptional behavior, usually someone will try to run
down the people who have been in an accident. I guess I'll vote for whatever
he is running for next election. We need an ethical take-action kind of guy
like that.
