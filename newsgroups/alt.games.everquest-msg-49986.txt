Also got to the forum section of eq.castersrealm.com/pon , there are quite a
few of 55+ Pallies there that can probably help you.  But as it was said,
Paladins are basically auxilliary tanks/healers.  It does suck to some
extent that Knights should have to play a backup role, and hopefully some
improvements with the melee changes as well as some enhancements with SoL
will give us a bit more of a role.  Basically I see Paladins in EQ as one of
the more Roleplaying motivated classes rather than being any great use to
the game dynamics.  What I would really like to see for the Pally class is a
discipline that allows us to take half the damage someone else gets, kinda
like throwing ourselves in the way of someone being hit.  But, not as yet
=(.  Anyway, go check out Castersrealm, they should no doubt help you out.
