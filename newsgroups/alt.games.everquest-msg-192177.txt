Who ever said anything about a guild "sucking"?  There's more to the
game than the elemental planes, after all.

But I hasten to note that there's a big difference between "Top 10"
and "Top 3" on a server.  On my server, after guild #4 it's pretty
much "whoever's next to get their ass kicked by the emp or AoW".

As an example, imagine you're in a guild that's say, #4 on your server
and you're trying a new, higher level encounter and you end up losing.
 Your analysis of your loss shows that you would most likely be able
to beat the encounter with (take your pick) two more
clerics/wizards/rogues etc,  so you look at your possible recruits and
see exactly what you need, but... they've got something of a dubious
reputation despite the fact that they're perfectly competent players. 
You find yourself at a crossroads.  Do you stick with your guns and
wait until your guild is geared better and kill the mob in a month? 
Do you try to recruit people with better reputations and delay your
kill for a month?  Or do you just accept the less than ideal people
into your guild and kill the mob the next time it's up?  Plenty of
guilds who are competing at the top end are more than willing to
choose the last option.  After all, if your guild stagnates you always
run the risk of losing your better equipped people to the guilds above
you.

That's the way it works on my server.
