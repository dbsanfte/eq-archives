No, I didn't, as you know.

I never said anything about "watching" you.  Are you getting paranoid?
About to add me to your "terrorist" list?  I also did not say that you
would cause me direct "great harm" from the postings.  Claiming that
*posts* themselves cause harm is your beef.  I worry about opinions
and attitudes, you know, all that "PC" stuff you deride but don't know
anything about.   I gave many examples of this, which you ignored-
probably because you could not find a substantive reply.

> Geeeeee.... Let me think on that one....

I wish you would.  You didn't even bother to reply to any point in my
post, although you did invent some of your own.   LOL.     In case you
missed it:

I find that there is no merit to the argument that the rights and
interests of heterosexuals would be affected by granting same-sex
couples the freedom to marry...
