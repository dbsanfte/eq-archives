Buying two of the Geforce Max 2 cards, 64 MB RAM. (Sorry if I spelled
that wrong. I always seem to.)

We've already had one MAJOR glitch in the upgrade process last night.
Wife attempted to download the latest drivers for her video card.
(Different one. nVidia TNT 16 MB RAM card). Downloaded an autoinstaller
for the alleged correct drivers. Restarted machine and the video was
toast. Several attempts at correction and two calls to Gateway technical
support later, we wound up having to reformat the HD. :-(
  So, still on the old drivers, but now have upgraded it to DirectX 8.1
on that machine with those drivers and all seems to be well.
  I can only pray that when the new cards arrive, they come with drivers
on disk or somesuch and that it goes more smoothly. Everything I've read
seems to indicate that DirectX 8.1 should be fine on those cards.
