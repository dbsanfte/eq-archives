Nah, you didn't.  Let me rephrase it.

Ok, you keep saying "case by case basis."  What if there's such a case where
the state wants to try a 6-yr old as an adult?  Could you, IN ANY INSTANCE,
agree with the state that this is the correct course of action?

In your own example:
>>Each case needs to be examined on its own
merits, and each little criminal has to be judged by their actions. There
are
obviously some mostly well behaved fourteen year olds out in farm country
who
might be out hunting squirrels with their cousin and accidentally shoot him
with
their .410 shotgun.  Should they get the death penalty or heavy time? Most
likely not. Then there's going to be 14 year olds who've already been in a
gang<<

One is a crime, one is not, so I'm not sure what you were trying to get
across.  In the first case there was no intent and probably no criminal
negligence.  In the 2nd obviously there is intent.
