Thank you -- I was going to post a similar reply, but you
saved me the trouble, and probably explained it better than I
could.

If his point were valid, then real-world economies would likewise
drive commodity prices down to the "crash point" as every vendor
tried to undercut his competition's price in a neverending spiral.

But they don't, for the reasons you state, and others.  Free markets
have more intrinsic checks and balances than he had presumed.
