Druids are good in dungeons, throughout all levels. They are 2nd only to 
Clerics as healers, but they have a lot more versatility, and can solo 
effectively pretty much right up to level 65, whereas a cleric cannot. I 
know grouping is more fun, however sometimes its not practical to group, 
and sometimes you just cant get a group.

With a slant on Ldon groups, IMHO, the most highly sought classes are 
(in no order) Pallies, Chanters, Clerics, Shaman and Bards, and most 
groups require at least one of these classes to manage the pulls.

Just my opinion and observations.....
