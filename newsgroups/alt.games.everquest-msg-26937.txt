[Since Bizbee claims to have me killfiled, is that a rhetorical
question?  If so, it's an awfully insistent one.  That's also
the reason I will speak of Bizbee in the third person throughout
this post -- I'm not talking to him, I'm talking to the newsgroup,
*about* Bizbee's bizarre post which I am responding to.]

Is Bizbee really so far gone that he doesn't know that this is
a public newsgroup, where people not only answer specific
questions, but also participate by adding their comments to
other ongoing discussions?

I don't recall anyone asking *Bizbee* any questions either before
he came flaming in to give Jazz shit for daring to mention Druids
in less than worshipful tones, but hey, being consistent in his
rants has never been Bizbee's strong suit.  It's vintage Bizbee
for him to accuse me of being a troll and "fucking moron" for
doing (much less incoherently) what he himself did first in
this thread.

Here's the recap:  Bizbee popped in unsolicited and gave Jazz
crap for the mild things he said about Druids.  I popped in
unsolicited to scratch my head over Bizbee's outburst, and
somehow *my* unsolicited observation makes *me* a "troll"
and a "fucking moron", whereas *Bizbee's* unsolicited flame
was all peachy-keen...

Let's replay Bizbee's scream with only the name swapped and
see if the shoe fits better that way:

#Excuse me, Bizbee, did jazz ask a question? No? So you're just a fucking
#moron for posting this, looking for a fight... right? RIGHT? Admit it
#Bizbee, you're a troll.

Ah, I've got it now.  Bizbee's "projecting" again:
  http://www.heretical.com/sexsci/bpsychol.html
(scroll down to "2a").

Oh, I read it.  Unlike Bizbee, I even understood it.

Here's Jazz's original "first paragraph" for those who are
just joining us:

# Ah, and a letter from one of our readers who is what some might call the
# "stereotypical" druid, (well, from a druid bashing perspective, anyway)
# who has solo'd his way to port capability with no need of help from
# others.

1.  It wasn't a whine about druids.

2.  It wasn't even a complaint about druids.

3.  It was a statement about the "stereotypical" druid-bashing
view, made with no statement indicating whether Jazz himself
subscribed to that view.

4.  It was further a statement that the person to whom Jazz was
responding fit the part of that stereotype about Druids who
spend all of their time soloing, which is hardly an attack.


My "drug addled brain"?  Sorry, but it's been over two decades
since I partook of any politically-incorrect intoxicants, and
my alcohol consumption is roughly one beer per month.  Bizbee
on the other hand admits to home-brewing, and I must say
that consuming his own products a bit too often would
certainly go a long way towards explaining a number of his
more belligerent, repetitive, poorly spelled, rambling posts.


>I thought I was done ever having to listen to your pointless
>blathering, danny, but I simply can't pass up an opportunity to point
>out the massive brain power behind posts addressed to people who tell
>you that they no longer get your posts directly.

I was addressing Jazz, actually, as even a child could see
if they bothered to read my post without being massively drunk
first, since I spoke of Bizbee in the third person, referred
to Jazz in the second person, and was responding directly to
(and quoting one of) Jazz's posts.

So speaking sarcastically of "massive brain power"...


>Can you say MONGOLOID?

Hey, *I'm* not the one who has trouble parsing simple pronouns.

Nor am I the one calling someone a "fucking moron" for the
"sin" of jumping unsolicited into a conversation after doing
just that himself first.

A mind is a terrible thing to waste.


> Or is it simply that your reading comprehension level is so
>low that you can't remember anything after about a week?

Nope, no problem at all, actually.  On the other hand,
Bizbee himself just today wrote (regarding something
he had blasted TWO DAYS AGO):

# All because I told you you were an idiot after making some stupid
# comments that I don't even remember anymore.

I'm sorry, *who* "can't remember anything after about a week"?


>Or, perhaps
>you can't even remember anything for a few seconds, as my "helpful
>post" wasn't directed at the original poster,

Have reading comprehension much?  I never said that post
was directed at the original poster, nor did I ever think it
was, nor indicate that I thought so.  I knew exactly who it
was directed at.


> but to a fucking moron
>on yet another anti-druid rant as if he has any idea what the hell
>he's talking about...

Amusing:  Bizbee apologizes to Jazz at the top of his post
for the inoffensive act of using Jazz's post as a jump-off to
respond to me, but then feels no compunction against calling
Jazz a "fucking moron" a little farther down (without apology,
of course).

That's certainly an unusual sense of etiquette, I must say.


> no, dan, not to you, not to Mr. Navarro...

Why yes, I know.  I never indicated otherwise.


> but
>here you come, blustering in, tiny cock waving proudly in your hand to
>make some lame ass comment.

Bizbee is certainly fond of talking about cocks, isn't he?
A close second is his predilection for talking about things
being put up asses.

And if anyone has engaged in "cock waving" here, I'd say it's
the Druid-playing person who decided to give someone shit for
making a couple extremely mild statements about Druids, as
if he was defending his own honor or something.

I'm at a loss to see how my post (saying in essence "what
was *that* all about?") could in any way be construed as
"cock waving" -- by anyone who was rational, I mean.


>Nice work, dan. We'll be looking at more of your brainless anti-biz
>posts, addressed to me, and floating into the ether, I'm sure.

Actually, all of my "anti-biz" posts are made with all
due consideration and a considerable amount of brainpower,
as Bizbee discovered when he made the mistake of challenging
one of my statements and demanding proof -- which I provided
in detail:
http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=3b595e6e.25599611%40news-server.houston.rr.com

Furthermore, Bizbee's hallucinating if he thinks that
I've *ever* engaged in a significant amount of "anti-biz
posts, addressed to [him]".

The post that he's flaming the shit out of right now was
addressed to *Jazz*, not Bizbee.  And I made my observation
on Bizbee's behavior after Jazz had already raised it as an
issue.

The same goes for the post I provided the link for three
paragraphs above, which got me killfiled by Bizbee (he
can dish out abuse all day long, but he clearly can
*not* take criticism himself) -- he challenged me to
support a statement that I had made to *someone else*
after *yet another* person had raised Bizbee's behavior
as a topic of conversation.

In the past year, I have a mere handful of unsolicited
posts directly to Bizbee giving him hell for his
atrocious behavior -- and even then only when the target
was undeserving.  Contrary to Bizbee's sniping comments
about me here over the past few weeks, I have never
taken him to task for flaming the shit out of someone
who had earned it, whether they were new to the newsgroup
or not.  I even praised some of his more deserved flames.

During the same period, I have made SCORES of perfectly
civil responses to Bizbee's posts, quite often complimenting
him on the good posts of his that deserved it.  Unlike
Bizbee himself, I do *not* hold a spiteful grudge.  Here's
one short example out of many:

# On Fri, 13 Apr 2001 10:46:50 -0700, bizbee <tuberoo@ix.netcom.com> wrote:

#>"I've already been here for 32 hours, I'll be <damned> if I'm going to

#
# LOL -- amen.

I've also answered a lot of Bizbee's questions, and provided
additional information to his posts without rancor many times.

But suddenly, when he challenges me to support something I
said about his flaming, and I *do*, he killfiles me for
suddenly being a useless, stupid, constant anti-bizbee troll?

Especially after Bizbee has launched a lot of first-strike
flames on *me* through the past year?

Something's not right here, but I don't think it's me.


>Now, I'm sure you and jazz have a lot of mutual ass kissing and
>patting each other on the back to do, so I'll leave you to it.

Whups, there's Bizbee's ass fetish again.


>By the way, I still ain't seein' SHIT (aptly named) that you post,

Admit it, isn't it so much more satisfying to sit there
and *imagine* that I'm obsessively stalking you, when I'm not?
Bizbee seems to actually *get off* on the idea that he's
worthy of such obsession.

In truth, the one post that Bizbee is jumping all over here is
the *only* one since he killfiled where I've mentioned him (not
counting twice where I responded when Bizbee sniped at *me*
first out of the blue while hiding behind his killfile), and
even that was a simple, "WTF was that about?", hardly the
sort of stalking that Bizbee would like to believe he's
able to inspire.

Here's my entire comment, in all of its allegedly
Bizbee-stalking glory:

[Addressed to Jazz:]
# I'm trying to figure out how he could have missed all the parts of
# your post which *did* deal with answering his question, and how
# he could have inflated the *one* line where you sigh about Verant's
# benevolence towards Druids into an alleged post-filling "whine".

Pretty mild stuff, eh?

Boy, if that's all it takes to set Bizbee off on an obcenity-filled
rant these days, he's pretty far gone.

What's even more ironic is that at the same time Bizbee is
getting off thinking that *I'm* running around posting snipes
at *him*, he himself has posted at least FOUR (perhaps more,
I don't seek them out, those are just the ones I've run
across) posts where he makes childish snipes at *me* out of
the blue, in threads where I wasn't even participating.
For example:

# But he's a newbie, and I wouldn't want dan day to drag this out in
# 2007 to back up another lameass lie he wants to make. I thought it was
# pretty borderline as it is... you know, NO ONE is allowed to flame a
# newbie... dan day says so.

I'm sorry, *who* is supposed to be stalking *whom* here?


> so don't waste your time...

It's no waste of time at all, actually, I consider pointing
out the flaws in misguided attacks to be a public service.
It helps newsgroup readers to understand who's full of it
and who's not.

And my comment on *this* occurrence of "don't waste your time"
is the same as it was the *last* time Bizbee tried to dissuade
me from posting:

# Killfiling me is one thing, but...  Is it just me, or does
# that second paragraph look like a desperate attempt to
# deter me from possibly embarrassing Bizbee any further?
#
# Especially since for all his faults, Bizbee *can't* be dense
# enough to think that the only reason to post a public response
# to a person is for that person's sole benefit.  So when
# he says, in effect, "you're stupid if you ever respond to
# any post of mine again because I won't be reading it",
# it looks instead like a clumsy ploy to try to shut me up.
#
# If so, it's not going to work.
#
# If Bizbee can "justify" in his own mind some of his more
# outrageous and offensive flames (to the point of screaming
# obscenities at me for daring to question his propriety),
# then I'm sure as heck going to feel free to continue
# to speak *my* mind.

  
> you're depending on someone else quoting you,
>and taking the chance that I'll read that post... 

Bah, someone flatters himself a great deal, doesn't he?

Actually, I'd be perfectly happy if Bizbee never saw
any of my posts ever again, because then I wouldn't have
to spend any time deconstructing all the belligerent
nonsense he throws at me (or anyone else) whenever
he decides we haven't been properly differential to him
or his EQ class.

Don't go away mad, Bizbee, just go away.  Sparing me
your hostility and leaving me to post in peace would
be a *blessing* -- I don't appreciate stalkers, especially
those who are so cowardly as to do it from behind killfiles
so that they can take pot shots but not have to deal
with any return fire.  As I also said in an earlier
post:

In over fifteen years of online discussion, I've *never*
killfiled *anyone*.  Why?  Because I can take whatever
anyone tries to dish out, or I can ignore it, without
mechanical help that shields me from the big mean world
of unfettered discussion.  Bizbee apparently can not.

But he still wants to fire his shots, doesn't he?


>In most circles, that would be called TROLLING.

It would be if that's what I were doing, but since I'm
not, Bizbee is just firing blanks and acting clueless
again.

Now then -- what's the name for the sort of behavior where
someone hides himself behind his killfile, then keeps
lobbing flames over the barricade?

I vote for "pathetic, obsessed, and cowardly", but I'm
open to alternate suggestions.
