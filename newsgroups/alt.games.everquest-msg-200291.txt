I am trying to cook up a way to make it feasible for me to use a 2HB
staff with my 58 ranger, instead of my swifty and tox axe, without
suffering too much in the damage department.  Reason being that I have
always loved the quarterstaff as a weapon, and that's what foxeye's weapon
was before Swifty.

So, with that in mind...

1. There are all sorts of skill modifying items in the game.  Is there a
cap to how high ones skill can go, though, as there is with
tradeskills?  So if I had a 2HB skill of 250, and a +5% item, would my
skill be the cap of 255, or closer to 267?

2. How much does RBG cost these days?  While I'd prefer a 41% haste item,
I won't be in a top-dog guild, and my understanding anyhow is that guilds
are biased against giving haste items to rangers who have swifty. :(  

3. How much is amy war staff, or better yet...what level could one group
take down the mobs who drop it? (I understand it drops in CT from the 4
Corner room, off of named mobs?)

4. Lastly, amy is a nice enough weapon, but my real desire is the Staff of
Four Winds from Auliffe Chaoswind in BoT.  Anyone have any experience with
how often this gem drops and what sort of team would be needed to take
Auliffe down?  Alla didn't have any specific info (though supposedly the
staff dropped twice once).  I suspect this item is a pipe dream, but...oh
heck, dreams are dreams...if they weren't hard they wouldn't be any fun!


Oh, heh, and does anyone know what Staff of four winds looks like?
