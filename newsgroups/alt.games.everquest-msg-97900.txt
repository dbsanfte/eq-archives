You are welcome Ben.  What support for your OPINIONs I provided was not at
all unintentional.  I do agree with you that these particular changes
probably have not crossed the line, but I do also feel some apprehension
regarding what this means for future changes.  I also do feel that you need
to learn the difference between fact and opinion.  I happen to agree with
you opinion that these changes do not cross the line, and I happen to
disagree with Jazz on that.  That is my opinion on the subject.
