I hate to say it, but it was South Park that made it popular.  Don't get me
wrong, I *love* that show (even if this season is lame), but I don't recall
hearing "gay" used to mean "lame" until then--and it certainly wasn't acceptable.

I also get tired of hearing people say, "I raped that orc," or, "I got raped on
that deal," and crap like that.  They have no clue.
