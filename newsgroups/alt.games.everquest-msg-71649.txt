I haven't seen the movie yet. I only know that, in the books, he uses a sword when forced
to fight before his arrival with the hobbits in Rivendell and then uses Anduril, his
sword, all other times he is in combat after they leave there.

When you had Gandalf saying, "Run!  Swords are no more good here!  We can't tank that
