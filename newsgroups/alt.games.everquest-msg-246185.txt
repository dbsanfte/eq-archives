Gates of Discord gets retuned!
Greetings Norrath!

Gates of Discord is being tuned to rework many of the experience areas to
better balance the expansion for all classes. It is our hope that this
re-tuning will allow for more group diversity and better use of individual
class skills while maintaining the challenge of the new content. We hope to
roll out these changes within the next 2 weeks. Here's a quick breakdown of
what's changed -
* Experience has been increased in several zones.
* Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi should be tuned more
appropriately for their intended level ranges.
* NPCs will no longer hit for max damage as often. Knights in particular
should find it easier to tank mobs they previously had difficulty with.
* Spell drops have been increased.
* Zone travel has been made easier.
* NPC innates have been adjusted to behave a little more reasonably.
* Animals in various zones across Gates have been made non-agro.

Note: Please keep in mind that these changes do not affect every zone.
We would like to thank all of the folks on the Test Server who have been
helping with the re-working of the encounters and we hope that you enjoy the
changes when they go live in the very near future.

Thanks all!

The EverQuest Design Team

Grats whiney ass knights, who spent the entire last expansion being
dominant, and now they arent the best again, all throw hissy fits, cry a
river of tears, and threaten to all quit (man good riddens, fuckin whiners!)

Anyway.. some good stuff in that at least
Exp was a joke in GoD
Spell drops were a joke
Zone travel wasnt that bad.. you just always had to be on guard

Wtb more mob models, and a different zone for 7 (yes, SEVEN) raid and group
expedition zones
