That's right.

I do think it's ok for kids to murder each other. I actively campaign for
the "Let Kids Murder Each Other" party, on the weekends I'm not at my cake
decorating lessons. You wouldn't believe the angry responses we get from
misinformed parents, when we knock on their doors, and try to hand their
kids baseball bats.

I have no qualms about kids being tried as adults, but why is it only when
they commit a crime, that they get treated as adults?

Why shouldn't they be allowed to purchase guns at 14?

Why shouldn't they be allowed to purchase alcohol at 14?

Why aren't they allowed to marry at 14?

Why no driving licence at 14?

Why have an age barrier for anything at all?
