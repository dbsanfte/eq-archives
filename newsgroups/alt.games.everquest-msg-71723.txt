A well balanced player based economy requires players to be able to add
value where npc's cannot. You're suggestion would enable npc's do add value
in the same way players do, as such not a good idea to help the economy.
Getting rid of large sums of money, means that players have less of it to
spend, this is also not good for the economy.
If the now limited ammount of discretionairy plat flows towards soulbinders
and sowshamans and rezclerics, because people will rather buy a rez instead
of a better cloak, the economy fails completely.

What we need is for the tradeskill system to be revamped in such a way that
there is actuall money to be made. The bazaar is a good step although we've
yet to see it work.
I want an archery target near every ranger guild (there is one in surefall
but it's just scenery) so that all archers can practise this skill better.
This would make the fletching skill a bit more desirable, though the
addition of shadewood bows is already very nice.
I want smiths to be able to add a stat bonus to every sword, claw and dagger
and the likes. Giving in an extra sharp edge or something.
I want tailors to be able to make something usefull, right now the only
items that sell are handmade packs and wu's
Why is there a brewing skill? It serves absolutely no purpose what so ever
right now. What about using alcohol as a desinfectant in bind wounds skill,
like bandages.
Poisonmaking is useless unless you are a rogue. Giving fletchers and smiths
the ability to apply poison would create a poison market. Arrows with poison
are cool and a blighted sword is too. It would wear off after a while
though.
Pottery could benefit from the new poison market, although with just one
item.
Fishing is good now, especialy at low levels
Baking could do with more stat food, but right now its far easier to just
get a stack of water and iron rations. Nobody wants a wedding cake.

New skills to be added:
Wood cutting. To aid fletching and smithing with arrowshafts bow staffs axe
handles and the likes
Skinning. To get more pelts of dead animals, also gives more meat for baking
