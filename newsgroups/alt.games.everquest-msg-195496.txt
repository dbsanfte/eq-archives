Never fails. I start up a new character nowadays, give him some plat and  
run him off to the Bazaar to equip him, nothing obscene, just some great 
gear for a low level. What happens when I get there? Every time I find 
myself staring seemingly forever at the search screen agonizing over each 
piece of gear, trying to get the very best gear I can on my budget. Hours 
later, I'm ready to go hunting - with a tentative glance back as I zone 
out. 

Anyone else suffer from a similar "kid in the candy store" syndrome thanks 
to the Bazaar? Not that I'm complaining, mind you.  :)
