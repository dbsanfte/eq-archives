How in the hell can you say that, DT?  I haven't spent much time in CB,
but if what the original poster describes is accuarate, it is *definitely*
a pathing bug. We've had this discussion here repeatedly.  I once cited an
instance where, in Gorge of King Xorb, the Minos will not follow you down
the right side wall on the valley leading to EK, but will instead run 90
degrees to the left wall, pull up even, and then run back over to you.
Seems like *everyone* here said that was an exploit. It's very unnatural
pathing.  When have you ever seen an orc not come barrelling right towards
you, but rather run along a riverbank to take the bridge?  That's  a bug
and if it wasn't such a lowbie area that GMs would never bother monitoring
it, you'd probably get warned immediately.
  The poster found a spot where he/she can safely just jump back and forth
across the river until the mob is smoked without taking any damage. Pretty
clear cut it seems, at least in keeping with Verant's "vision" of exploits
as layed out following the whole Conquest fiasco.
