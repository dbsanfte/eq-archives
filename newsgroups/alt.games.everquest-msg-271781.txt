I'm going on a business trip to Florida later this month and I'm 
spending a day and a half in Miami.  I have a tee time at Doral.  I've 
never played the course, but I've heard it's excellent.

I just got a new Callaway ERC Fusion 3 wood and am anxious to use it.  I 
thought I would ask some of you a few questions to get your thoughts on 
the course.

1. What brand of rental clubs do they have?  I'm not sure if I am going 
to bring mine or rent.

2. What is the toughest hole?

3. Since I am completely unfamiliar with the course, I am thinking about 
buying the Tiger Woods golf game for Xbox so that I can get an idea of 
how it plays.  Do you think this is a good idea?

Thanks for your help.
