Well, that cuts both ways.

Right now the vendors don't give jack for many items, so the
players all try to sell them to each other, the market gets flooded,
and the prices of those items plummet.

On the other hand, if vendors gave great cash for those items,
*those* items would maintain a given value, but the flood of
additional pp into the economy would cause inflation which
would make the "real" cost of those items still drop, and
the cost of all other items go *up*, which as always would
squeeze those on a "limited income" (the newbies).

So it's not an easy problem to solve.
