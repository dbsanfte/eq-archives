That's why I never travel without a minimum of 2 stuns loaded as a Chanter.  
If the mob is mezzable, hopefully it's stunnable.  Stun, then mez is the 
way I go, although I've been channeling through some serious smackin-rounds 
lately.

In that same zone, that has gotten me in trouble, though.  Ran to the gypsy 
camp to bind someone, they get jumped by a bear or something, I decide to 
stun out of habit to help them.  Yeah, real smart.

I ended up living, but it's only because the chanter babe there charmed me 
as I went unconscious.  Very weird experience.

I did the same in EC when a guy I was claritying got jumped by a bear 
though the walls of the fletcher hut.  I didn't live through that one, 
though.
