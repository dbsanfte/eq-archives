Clueless...   hopeless...   witless...   these are just some of the words I
am thinking while reading your post.

From www.lavishsoft.com:

(I'm pretty sure this is how the posting started this morning, making your
short term memory capacity rather alarmingly limited)

"Allows tweaking of the actual world rendering rate so that the interface
still works and responds at full speed, but the display of the actual world
updates less (NOTE: If render limiting is on, the display will "flicker", so
this is only good for background windows). Rendering the world takes
approximately 50% of the CPU time used every frame (MMOTools Subscribers
only)"

The only thing I have no clue about is how illiterate people manage to find
usenet.  =P
