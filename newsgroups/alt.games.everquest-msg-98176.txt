Can I hear you say clueless troll?  I knew you could.  Problem with testing
on Test Server versus testing on a live server, is there is bound to be
something that you can't predict that will happen.  Even on test server,
you won't always have people act like total jackasses or purposely do
something.  Its easy to bitch and gripe and make assumptions of someone
else's mistakes.
