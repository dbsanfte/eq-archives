No, the GPL was invented to kill commercial software.  Take a
gander at the "philosophy" pages at:

http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html

Stallman and his cronies won't rest until commercial software
is completely obliterated, and the GPL is their weapon of choice.

: Bullshit. You've been swallowing too much MS propoganda lately.

This comment shows what you know about me.  (Nothing.)  My opinion
is that Microsoft has done illegal and unethical things and keeps
getting away with slaps on the wrist.

It's not incompatible to dislike the GPL and dislike MS at the
same time, you know.

: I don't know about you, but I don't trust an entity which tries its best 
: to take the freedom of choice away from the consumer.

Ah, good, then we agree that the GPL is bad.  All we can do is
hope the GPL does not succeed in its mission to take away the
commercial software choice for future generations.

: You are wrong on one very important fact. If a developer releases his 
: code under the GPL, all other development of that code must also be 
: released under the GPL. However, the original developer has complete 
: freedom in the first place to release his code under whichever license 
: he chooses. The fact that his code may be developed to run under Linux, 
: or Solaris, or Windows is irrelevent.

I knew this already.  I know the original author can dual license
his or her code.

However, any reasonably complex project has had so many "fingers
in the pie" that trying to de-GPL-ize something once it's been
GPL'd is near impossible.

The obvious exception is large projects done by a very small group
of individuals who did not accept code donations.  Those can be
reasonably de-GPL-ized.  Theoretically.

: Writing applications for Linux does not mean you have to release it 
: under the GPL.

Thank you, but I already knew that.  My point was that by
supporting Linux (even as a user), you are encouraging the
GPL, and by encouraging the GPL, you are encouraging the
obliteration of commercial software.

I think that is a misguided choice.

: They don't have to. Companies which choose to release software under the 
:   GPL have the benefit of thousands of skilled programmers bugtesting 
: and further developing their code, which the company can make money off 
: through documentation, support and distribution.

Yes, and we all know precisely how successful those companies
are.  (Not very.)

: The problem with the BSD licence is it allows others to rip off your 
: code which you have released the source to, then develop their own code 
: on top of it without having to release the added development source.

If you really want to discriminate against companies, then
release your source code under a non-profit or "for non-commercial
use" license.  There is no need to "protect yourself" (sic) with
the GPL.

However, the FSF has done an amazing job at brainwashing developers
into thinking they need to protect their precious source code from
those evil companies.

: Sure the GPL may not provide for a viable business model, but as I

See my comments earlier re: "encouraging" the GPL.
