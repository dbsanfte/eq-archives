I have 4 answers for you
Yes, But, No, and Huh

Yes, Macroquest will allow you to do a handsfree cleric bot either with
no intervention, or with you calling for heals from the primary
character,

BUT, Macroquest does allow meddling with the inward workings of EQ, and
can allow cheating, hacking, etc.  Some devs have spoken up on the
EQLive boards indicating that it is not necessarily cheating.

No, I do not have any experience with macroquest, and I do know that
for a basic heal bot, a couple 5 line macros will allow you to run one
quite effectively
first
/pause 5,/cast 4  ( where 5 is 5/10 of a second for fizzles and 4 is
your CHeal) This pauses after the cast attempt
/pause 5,/cast 4
/pause 200 Wait 20 seconds(13.5 seconds for CHeal+recovery time and a
couple more for normal wait
/pause 5,/cast 4
/pause 5,/cast 4

second for pulling
/pause 5,/cast 3 (where 3 is your HoT)
/pause 5,/cast 3
/pause 150  wait 15 seconds, for refresh, and for the Hot to be doing
its thing during and after the pull
/pause 5,/cast 4  Start the CHeal chain
/pause 5,/cast 4

HUH, if you want to run a bot, why not run something useful like a
shaman or a druid, and get either slows, Dots, and pet damage with the
shaman or snares, dots and ports from the druid.  If I was rolling up a
bot pair today it would be either shaman paladin or druid, Beastlord.
Nothing you will come across thats duoable requires cleric healing.
