Fuck that. If my RP adventuring is bothering someone's someone they can
always find someplace else to get married. What's next? You go to a

I don't want this anger that's burning in me.
It's something from which it's so hard to be free.
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page.
