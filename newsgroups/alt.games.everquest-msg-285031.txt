Well I went to the forums after I couldn't get in and it said that the
patch was to be extended another 3 hours and when that time was up I
went back to the forums and found that the patch should be over at
1PDT... wonder if they're going to extend the patch again, just what
could they have changed to make the patch 8 hours long?
