PoS/PoV is not a high tier flag, it gives you access to only tier 2 out of
5. Besides, even the tier 1 planes have a lot of "junk loot" that sells for
exorbitant prices, much more efficient even soloing than the pittance HGs in
RM give.

I had PoS/POV on my druid at level 60, any trials group without Banish is
just asking to fail.
