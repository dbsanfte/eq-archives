Bored... hmm.. Well I guess yes the support role in the EXP grind is
rather lame...  I do enjoy being a cleric on a Raid, but there is no
forward advancement on levels in that mode.....

ahh those boots sound sweet.... my resists are what keep me from
joining my guild often... they are doin HoT now, and well I am young
for going there... but clerics usualy get brought if their resists are
high enough...
My first and only run in HoT was a blast, but I had to bag most of my
equipment... and our Main Tank handed me a bag full of resist gear..
course he wanted it back heheheh.
