Yep, that is why I never did. A later version of that was that in guk
there was a bug where if you consented ANYONE to drag your corpse then
it was left there ANYONE at all could loot it.. ANYTIME before you
looted it. That caused many people to be falsely accused, verant gms
calling player's liars for a while "uhh your friend must have looted
your corpse".. etc until they finally bothered to check. People both
quit over being accused eventually by the GM and their friends AND
people quit who lost all their stuff feeling some trusted buddy had
swiped it. 

Playing the troll sk I started when they removed the hybrid xp
penalty, and made the lifetaps take the parent classes mana (instead
of 3 x as much), and added SEVERAL key lifetaps (most notably the
level 30 one giving the sk 40 hp back.. which is frankly a lifesaver),
is probably about the biggest improvement I've seen. I started an sk
on a server when the game was new and thought it was a horrible
character.. essentially a 2nd rate melee not as good as a warrior with
a few crappy spells. Now they are really a fantastic character,
probably one of the best in the whole game and the only melee type who
can reasonably solo well from 1 - 60. God those people who played them
back then really had some stones though, in fact back when they played
even that level 50 big lifetap quest was not in yet since I remember
when that was added when I was on tribunal.

Sk gets my vote for most improved class overall, hands down.
