But again, you can never really prove a negative, can you? Who's to say that in
the time between when you did /who all druid 45 and when you typed /who all druid
45 count, that one of the others didn't die, zone, or log off? And yes, frankly
I'm shocked that there would only be two 45 druids on any but the newest server
at any time. Anonymous or otherwise.
