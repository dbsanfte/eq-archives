Tried PoJ, pulling down the stairs to the circle, or out to the
graveyard, or into the U of the exit area.  Every direction I
went I got adds.

Tried PoD, only thing not red to me was flies, but I got three at
a time pulling those.

I did get in a group of low 50s, we rocked out in PoJ pulling to
the exit, I mezed adds without any problem.

We then moved to PoInnovation, about a third of the mobs there
were immune to my mez, and our puller was an SK who wouldn't stop
using DOTs as his taunt... all well and good if he'd pick
unmezables as his first target, but a mess since he wasnt being
picky.

Then we moved to PoDisease, where we got a spot pulling goos and
rats that went very smoothly, some of the rats explicitly
informed me that they weren't mezable with that song but here we
had plenty of room for me to run adds around in circles till they
were next on the hit parade.

I got 4 yellow in about 4 hours play time, with a good portion of
that spent trying out new ideas and approaches to compensate for
our devastating lack of level.  All in all, a good use of my pre
turkey time.

On the other hand, the odds of my stumbling across a pickup group
as a 46 bard (now 47) in PoP are vanishingly small, I'm really
hoping someone has some tips as to what and where I might be able
to pull single non casting mobs that aren't red to me, and have
room to kite them in circles without danger of adds.
