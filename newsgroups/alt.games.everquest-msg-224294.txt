Having just achieved level 52 recently I'm finally facing all the questions
surrounding AA strategies. For my class (Shaman), I believe the most
critical AA purchase will eventually be my Canni V spell. This
class-specific AA purchase requires all 3 levels of the Mental Clarity
archetype, so that settles that. Mental Clarity requires that I invest 6 pts
into some General AA and that's my question.

I'm tempted to invest in enhancing my regeneration since this is what drives
a Shaman. I am often referred to in my groups as a mana machine and most of
that mana is a direct function of my HP so anything that boosts regeneration
of health or mana is thematic, mission-critical and way cool.

But I've had a lot of advice suggesting that I invest instead in Innate Run
Speed. For someone who casts SoW (or for that matter, who owns SoW boots),
this doesn't seem like a good investment to me. So I'm likely to put my
general pts into enhancing my regeneration, but I thought I'd check here
first to see if there are other thoughts I'm missing.

I've also heard from others that one should NOT start acquiring AA points at
this level, and should instead continue to focus on acheiving levels. I have
a unique situation in that my usual partner and best online friend (Monk 46)
is serving in the Navy and won't be returning from his current assignment
until Nov 21 so I don't want to get too far ahead of him. Fortunately, he
has a Cleric 52 alt that he'll probably switch to when he returns and he can
join me and everything will be cool. We have another close friend who is
playing a 45 Warrior and he needs to catch up to us. None of us have ever
done Vox or Naggy raids and we're all very interested in that experience.
From what I understand you can't do those post-52 so for all these reasons,
I need to park my leveling at 52 and not advance, at least for the time
being. Now, I'm obviously NOT going to stop playing (DUH) so I'm thinking
that I should just switch to 100% AA generation during this time that I'm
waiting. Or maybe I'll advance with generic experience until I get within a
yellow of 53 and stop there, just for good insurance sake.

One final question. I turned on AA generation just to see how it goes and I
discovered to my horror that there's a whole new "experience bar" down at
the bottom of the screen that has to completely fill up just to get ONE
measly AA point. Is this correct? Does this mean that advancement toward an
AA point takes place at the same rate as advancement toward a level? If
that's true, than a level 65 with 100 AA points means that the guy has the
experience of 165 levels (taking into account that level acquisition speed
remains presumably constant at 65-speed for those 100 pts)? Can this really
be?
