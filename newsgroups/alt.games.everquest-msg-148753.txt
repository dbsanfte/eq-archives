Read page 16. Seems this 'guide' got his peepee whacked and
is just ranting sour grapes. No wonder it takes so long to answer
petitions if they don't even have a clear name policy and sit and
argue over it.

The guide program sucks? No shit, like we didn't know that?

What I don't get is if these guides are basically working for
free and if it sucks, just quit. God bless you guys for hanging in
there and helping the players but if you keep being suckers
for Sony they are going to keep taking advantage of you.
