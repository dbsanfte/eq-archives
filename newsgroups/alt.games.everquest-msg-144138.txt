I was in CC once with my Monk at 33 (I think) and my question for my cleric
is how do I get there safely.  I remember at the time, getting invis and
running like a madman through Ry'Gorr Keep and touching that crystal,
praying to Cazic-Thule (my monk was Ikky) that the invis wouldn't wear off
before I got there.  Is there a better way to do this?  At the time I
thought it odd that a 34ish zone was surrounded by a 40+ zone.
