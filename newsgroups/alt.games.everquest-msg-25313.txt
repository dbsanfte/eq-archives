After you run for a ways and stop, I'm told the system can still "think you are
moving", but it's easily enough corrected.  When you stop running, turn
slightly to one side or the other. That apparently "resets" your position so
you're definitely not thought of as still running.  I had that problem back
when I was playing my wiz. (Run for a short ways and try to root.)  Doing the
slight turn thing seemed to stop the problem, or at least cut it down a lot.
