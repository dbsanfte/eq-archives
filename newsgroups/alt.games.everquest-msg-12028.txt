Yep, that's what I mean, but no, staying grouped is often a deliberate
part of the plan, with the porter as leader so as to invite pickups in,
then get them back close so the mage can COTH them in.  Other
times its just a luxury as the porter makes a loot selling run or jaunts
leaving party members out; you can keep chatting with them and
keep them updated as to the status of your camp.  Distance is the
answer, a confirmation message would be a conveinience.  Nothing
earthshattering, but I don't see the down side.

No, I wouldn't.  I trusted them, they screwed me, that's part of the
game, not (to me) a reportable offense.  I'd be either mad or
amused depending on the details, and they might well get bad
faction (ressing cleric) that would cause me to revive them later...
do you people really read -that- confirmation notice?

I don't see Bind as all that deadly, though easily as inconvienient as any port
could be, but wolf form sure is...

I agree here, any potenitially dangerous or annoying spell should
get a confirm requirement instead of the current clumsy group
requirement.  Invisibility is a serious potential annoyance to
a pet class, for example, and I've seen many a carefully buffed
and expensively equipped pet dropped by a careless invising.

Unfortunately, this would mean you could harras people by
forcing confirms on them continuously...
