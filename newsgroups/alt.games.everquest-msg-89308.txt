Yes your ISP has to provide newsgroup access.  You will need to know the
server name and possibly your user name/password.  Here's some setup
guidlines:

1. Click on the Tools menu and go to accounts...
2. On the Internet accounts window, click Add then news
3. For Display Name, type your name the way you want it to appear to other
newsgroup users.  Click next.
4. This is self explainitory, type your e-mail.  You can type in some bogus
address if you wish to stay anonymous and it will still work.  Click next.
5.  Type the address of your ISP's news server.  This is usually something
like news.ispname.com.  Contact your ISP to find out what this should be.
Click next.
6.  Click Finish.  The account wil show up in the Internet accounts window.
Click close.

7.  You will see the account under your folder list.  When you click on it,
Outlook Express will ask if you wish to download a list of newsgroups from
the server.  Click yes (this will take some time, be patient).
8.  Now just search for "alt.games.everquest" (or any other newsgroup you
wish), double click it to subcribe
9.  alt.games.everquest appears indented under your folder list and you're
done!

Hope this helps =)  If you can't get it to work, then there are probably
some special setup options that your ISP requires.  In that case, contact
them for more info.
