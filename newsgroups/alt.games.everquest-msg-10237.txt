If that's the same faction the guards outside the entrance to Ak'Anon
are on, they were not KOS to my agnostic Dark Elf Wizard, who has done

There was a quest NPC right inside the city that didn't like me, though,
and once he aggroed, so did clockworks, so I haven't tried seeing what
the guards in the city think.
