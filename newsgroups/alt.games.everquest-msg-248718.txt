Well, as a player of EQ, I want EQ2 to stop, not fail. I, and many
others who play EQ will simply not play EQ2. I love the community in
EQ, and the game is sometimes very fun, but SOE has taken a "strip it
down for profit and fun EQ2" approach to EQ that makes me never want
to do business with them again.

So, do I want EQ2 to fail? I guess I don't care. I just don't want to
play it.

If SOE releases EQ2 and it kills EQ, I'll either just stop playing or
go to WoW. I know at least 20 people who feel the same way, and yet I
don't think SOE yet understands just how much they've disenfranchised
their player-base by reducing customer support, leaving petitions
unanswered for days, failing to fix bugs, releasing broken patches and
releasing two painfully obvious stopgap expansions (LoY and LDoN) that
added little content and forced users to upgrade in order to gain
access to features users had demanded since the game was released
(e.g. mapping).

On the other hand, others have been correct. EQ has been pronounced
dead at least a dozen times in the past 5 years, and even though I've
come to dispise SOE's business practices, I'll continue to play EQ as
long as it's out there because I've made some great friends here, and
have a lot of memories in-game that I don't want to leave behind.

EQ2 will have a limited community because it's being released after an
SOE failure (SWG), concurrent with three other big releases (EQ: OoW,
WoW, CoH), and the fact that there is a general fear that customer
support will be ok for the first year or two, and then fall apart as
soon as SOE decides it's time to start work on EQ3. Remember that
these customer bases are measured in tens or hundreds of thousands. An
active discussion board can be built around dozens.

The problem is that it doesn't have to be a good game to destroy EQ
and even if it IS a good game, it will likely fail to capture the
audience it needs to survive. If it just does "ok", the player base
will shrink and eventually attrition will kill the game. At which
point SOE will likely have lost EQ *and* EQ2.

Re-name it, "Fantasy World" and run it un-connected to EQ. I'd be fine
with that. Let it sink or swim on its own just like SWG, but don't
release a "sequel" to EQ. The very concept is absurd. You can't have a
sequel to a community and that's what EQ is.
