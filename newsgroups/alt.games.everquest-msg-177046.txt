Group and kill things. If you want to solo, you've pretty much picked the
wrong class.

Niether of those will work.    A short time after they went in, they lowered
Soulbinders to level 1 or 0.   Combat skills will not raise on green things.

Duels with players do not raise combat skills either.   You can duel a
caster with a blue to you pet, and combat skills will raise on attacks aimed
at the pet, but thats about it.
