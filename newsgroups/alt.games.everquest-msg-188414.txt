I've actually been in the situation where this guy was so far ahead of his
pull that I never saw the relationship.  There was just this Orc tooling
along right in front of myself.  I said "self, we cannot let Orcs wander
aimlessly".  So I nuked it.  The guy ranted on and on about his pull.  On
his first contact, I apologized for taking his kill and said I would be more
careful.  He felt obliged to heap on the abuse, so I just walked away (well,
ran, I hardly ever walk anywhere).  We sometimes make mistakes.  C'est la
vie.

Cheers,
Eric
