I have given mine out exactly once.  I was on a raid, my ISP went down, and
I called a trusted friend, had her gate me out.  As soon as I could get back
on, I changed my password.  You never know, even with a trusted person,
somebody could be looking over their shoulder, or, you could have a major
falling out.  It's just not worth it.

Definitely /petition.  Even if they have not changed they banning policy,
what do you have to lose, if you aren't going to play them anyway.
