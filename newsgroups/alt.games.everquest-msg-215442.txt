Except for the fact that telling people to /ex or /q may get you banned (I
report/petition idiots who suggest either in my hearing), I gotta wonder why
people are asking a mage for buffs.  Wouldn't it be simpler to just say you
have no buffs, and walk away? Or if that isn't rude enough (since you
obviously wish to be rude), just remain silent.  I use the silent method.
