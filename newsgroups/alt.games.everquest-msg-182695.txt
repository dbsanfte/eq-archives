>>  I did get the old ID/password out of Sony's website. <<

If your account is still there, and you have the old ID/password, you don't
need a CD key. Just log in, and there you go.

Now, if your second comp doesn't have EQ on it, then you will either:

A. Have to buy another CD to install it
B. Find a friend who will let you borrow thier disc .. or
C. Copy all the files from one comp to the other.

Hope that helps.
