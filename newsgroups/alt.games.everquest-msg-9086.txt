The FBI didn't start that fire -- any more than they forced the
cultists at Jonestown to drink cyanide or the Heaven's Gate 
folk to put plastic bags over their heads.  The messianic cultists 
at Waco started that fire and killed their own children.  That
is what should cause you concern.  It is unconscionable for you to
lie and exploit their deaths for cheap political rhetoric.
