 From what I remember, at 200-210 you hit 'the wall', where skillups are 
few and far between, all the way to 250.
A couple of questions: Is your int capped? If not, insane as this may 
sound, try to cap it as hard as you can. a 500pp piece of major int gear 
can save you thousands of PP in skillup attempts. I got KEI.
Do you have a gearlok?
Are you enchanting all your metal? I seem to remember enchanted vs. 
unenchanted at the high end makes the unechanted slightly lower trivial

One suggestion, depending on how much diamonds are on the bazaar, you 
are likely going to lose less money per combine on Platinum Malachite 
Rings. Gone are the days when you made enough profit to break even on 
combines with plat, I'm afraid. I don't know how much you will lose 
though. (actually, from plat malachite on, with gearlok, I consistantly 
made money, which I proceeded to blow on the failed trophy attempt #1. 
Don't get me started on Failed trophy attempt 2 and 3)
