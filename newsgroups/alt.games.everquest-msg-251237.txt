Just starting up a topic.

I've tried this exactly once, in HOH.

Went out, pulled one of the two entrance mobs with Firebolt of Talon. 
Got both.  Ran into the GY, sicced pet on my target, ran in circles.

At least one of the two aggroed onto my pet, ate it.

Ran out to the exit and left the zone.

SO

What did I do wrong?

Well, first off, I aggroed two mobs, but only actually did anything to 
one of them.  When I sicced the pet onto my original target, he got the 
same "someone attacking my buddy" aggro as I had, but he was much 
closer, so proximity kicked in.  I'll wager that the original mob was 
still on me, but the add killed my pet.

If this is going to work, I'd think I'd either have to aggro just one 
mob, or I'd have to be able to irriate both mobs a lot; outrunning them 
sufficiently to be able to cast a nuke on the add BEFORE siccing pet on 
either.

I think, from 57 levels as a bard, that I can eliminate one of the other 
difficulties, which is that the pulled mob is going to be running pretty 
fast and my pet is going to lose some DPS keeping up with him.  Two 
answers; one, Expedience, which is a mage cast SOW, working on my own 
pet only.  Two, run in TIGHT circles, so that the mob runs an even 
tighter circle in the center, and my pet stays inside of that circle so 
he has is in melee range of the target at all times.

Any other tips?

Ideas of better places to try this?

My soloing style till now has been the classic "pet as MT, mage as 
healer and fire support" style.  Sadly, my pet is only a so so tank, 
particularly without buffs, and I'm a pretty terrible healer these days, 
a sad comedown from early mage levels where I could hold my own healing 
against other classes.

Course grouping or even duoing with pretty much any other class would be 
a way around this, but I'm interested at the moment in solo styles, for 
those times when I can't find a partner or am only going to be on a 
short time and don't want to spend it setting up a partnership.
