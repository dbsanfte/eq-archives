Does anyone have problems staying connected using RoadRunner cable modem
service out of TampaBay? I usually would get disconnected about every 45-60
minutes but ever since Luclin has come out I get disconnected any where from
1 min-10 min! I have a alternate ISP (Earthlink) and the connection is fine.
Never have been disconnected yet.

I would like to ping and/or tracert the EQ server(s) but I don't have any
idea what the servers are. Anyone have any ideas? Thanks
