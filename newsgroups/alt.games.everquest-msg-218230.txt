I have just a few people on my ignore list, and for the life of me, I 
can't remember why they're there. However, I saw enough reason to put 
them there at some point, so I'll stick to my guns and keep on ignoring 
them.

I've found more instant gratification where habitual jerks are concerned 
by  being in a group later and having the leader invite said Jerk to 
join. I politely offer the leader my sincere apologies and inform them 
that if Jerk will be joining, I will be leaving. I wish them luck and 
thank them for having me. Each of the few times it has come to this, I 
was contacted by the group leader moments later with an invite after 
their having rescended Jerk's invite.

Keep it honorable. You will still run into Jerk on occasion, but it 
won't hurt so badly.  :)
