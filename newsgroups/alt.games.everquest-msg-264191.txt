"May not" is actually an improvement from earlier when they said
outright that those were going to slip past release.

The major concern for most betatesters (the ones that care at least)
is that one race (undead) actually has its racial traits in-game and
(they say) this is unfair especially in PvP.

However since you couldn't pay me to put up with the childishness that
the WoW PvP servers will have, I'm not too worried about it.
