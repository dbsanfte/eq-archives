Trying to log in this morning. (Yes, I know, it's patch day.
Yes, I know that's why I can't log in. No, I'm not complaining
about it. :) ) So, I'm occasionally hitting the connect key
(I *really* like it when I'm the first 10 or 20 in the bazaar
or PoK :P) and there are two messages that pop up and I'm just
wondering if I have their meaning down.

The first one is the 1001 error. Cannot connect to Everquest.
That means that I've made it to the game server but the server
is not up, neh? The second one is 0023. Our login and registra-
tions servers are congested. On that one, I haven't even made
it to the game server yet, correct, so I really have no idea
whether the game is up or not?
