Is the level 49 ranger quest spell, Call of Flame, really worth it?

It does 206 points of damage for 100 mana and a 2 second cast time
with an 18 second recast time?  Decent nuke, but considering that to
get it I have to get an Electrum Bladed Wakashi (I HATE Mistmoore) and
an Adamantite Band for the quest.

Balance that out with the fact that at 52 I get Firestrike which does
300 damage for 155mana, 4sec cast time, and a 2.5 sec recast.  

Just doesn't make CoF seem worth it, particulaly since I hardly ever
nuke anyway.
