Sol Ro level probably becomes doable at 20-30 nowadays untwinked (and
twinked you wouldn't want it).

Twilight Sea is about L30-40 but isn't worth the effort. You will
outlevel it before you complete one piece.

The quest armor from Thurg is doable with a group in the 50s (slowly).
They are rare drops.

The two armor sets that have their drops in ToV require L46+ but
realistically take a group of 60s to do in any reasonable amount of
time. A raid of 50s. Things have changed; it used to take a raid of
mostly 60s to handle E/WToV, but not anymore.

You can buy the ornate molds for hideously overhigh prices (tens of
thousands of pp for some pieces). Otherwise expect them in the 60s.

The elemental quest drops are raid only in elemental planes, you won't
see them before 65 unless something freaky happens.

All the other sets are either dropped or tradeskilled.
