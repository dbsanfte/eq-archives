I ffind myself with the same problem. The curse is that Sony is
offering too good a deal. If the KoS expansion was the expansion only,
and was priced like $30, then you would have a simple decision and
would probably buy only the expansion. But since they throw in the full
game, its tempting to say hey i can get a whole anohther account so now
i have two accounts for the price of one. The hitch is that your
characters are all on the old account.

Eq1 is simliar..titanium edition is out for 19.99 that has all
expansions of EQ. I want to buy it for Don for one account, but am
thinking hey I can get a new account "for free" and keep my Don-less
account. But my chars will still be on the Don-less account. I didnt
achieve my original goal lol.

This is where having a strong moral compass comes in handly..keep to
your original goal and dont by swayed by SoE seductive enticements
(sorry for the mixed analogy).
