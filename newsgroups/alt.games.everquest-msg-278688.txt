I think many people just don't understand no-drop.

Its about the idea of "uniqueness", and "personal involvement", and part 
of how mmrpgs try to inject a little "heroism" or to convey that there 
are things in the world that are about YOU. The game is about YOU, and 
what YOU do.

No drop items aren't magic items that are somehow too sticky to give to 
someone else, they are about capturing the idea that there are items out 
there that only YOU can get, and that YOU must get them yourself, 
because other people havnen't and can't.

If you want MobY's ThingX, you have to go and get it. There is only one 
in the whole world, and MobY has it. 

There's definitely a fundamental suspension of disbeleif in play. Your 
supposed to ignore that other people have killed MobY before you, and 
that ThingX exists in other people's hands.  The quest texts are 
personal, the items often refered to in the singular. Bring me THE 
"heart of Y"... etc. I think by and large most people do accept this 
suspension on some level, even as they paradoxically farm the named mob 
over and over again. 

No Trade is the compromise between actually injecting items and quests 
that are personalized for each player, and incredible cost of actually 
doing that, and so the same quest is reusable, but from each players 
point of view, its just for them. 

"No Trade" is the mechanic that allows it to happen.

If you imagine no drop items as "gm events" its more logical. Imagine 
them spawning unique mobs and unique items just for you as you complete 
various stages. Other people wouldn't be able to get the items or even 
kill the mobs because they would only exist at all for you. The items 
wouldn't "need" to be no drop per se but it wouldn't matter because 
you'd never be able to buy or trade for them anyways. And the items 
aren't droppable of course, by necessity of the fact that from everybody 
elses perspective... you don't have it. If they are working on that 
quest then you aren't, if they are trying to remove the heart of Y from 
Y's chest, then that's where it is, not in your backpack, etc.

In a way its existential.
