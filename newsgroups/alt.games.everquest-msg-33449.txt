    My nuke takes seven seconds to cast - a TON of time for something to
physically move me with a hit. Being moved, I imagine, is what's
interrupting me - so the damage from the hit almost doesn't matter. I'm
guessing your spell doesn't take seven seconds to cast. ;-) My other
operating theory is that a successful Dodge causes a Channel check - I'm
sure I'm not the only one that's been standing toe-to-toe with a mob,
started to cast, had it miss EVERY time, and still been interrupted at the
end of the cast.
