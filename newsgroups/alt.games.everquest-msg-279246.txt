I can't, because I don't have characters that match those criteria.  =)
There are plenty of comments on the monk class boards about non-raiders
3-boxing DoN missions.  It's irrelevant, because the actual implication was
that if I could 3-box something, a much lesser geared full group could
handle it.

Try tanking a DoN with 500k worth of bazaar gear and I might be willing to
discuss it.  I've dropped more than 50k on a single item for a level 10
twink.   =P

Another discussion on the monk class boards that mirrored this one saw me
post a made up magelo of entirely single-group obtainable gear that would
put a non-raiding monk within a couple hundred hp of me, a "high end"
raider.

In that discussion I also mentioned that if you expected to equip in bazaar
gear and then jump straight to my hypothetical setup you were going to be in
for some pain.

See, "a non-raiding monk within a couple hundred hp of me".

I have far more than 1k hp...

It wasn't terribly uncommon for me to have twice the hp of a non-raider a
couple years back.  It isn't terribly uncommon for a non-raider to have
within 3/4 or better of my hp these days, and I'm much farther ahead of the
curve than I was back then to boot.  The gap has *narrowed*.

I make it sound like 50 people work for a year on *that* one upgrade for one
guy, all acquiring their own upgrades along the way.

With that comment, you make it sound like you've sprained your hyperbole.

No, it doesn't.  Take the "time and effort" you put into getting into KT and
compare it with the time and effort it takes your guild to move into the
Ikkinz raids, Uqua, Inktuta, Qvic and Txevu.  The trip to KT seems hard, it
did to me, but trust me when I tell you that you ain't seen nothing yet. 
(Actually one of my pet peeves about GoD is how needlessly complex the
progression is, even though I find the actual raid encounters, once you
actually get access to them, very entertaining).

It's even funnier how people who *choose* not to benefit from a system that
they could benefit from if they were willing to *try* will "speak out" to
try to get the effort required reduced.  =)
