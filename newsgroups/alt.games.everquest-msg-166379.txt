Some d00d abbreviations save time (for the typer)... "plz" rather than
"please" for example. The random substitutions because it's supposed to
be k3wl are another matter.

I can almost live with the first; they merely indicate a lack of
consideration. The latter is just stupid. There is an upside though:
- The user gets to think they are k3wl.
- Members of the subculture can recognise one of their own.
- The rest of us have a quick and reliable way of recognising people
  that we would rather avoid. Assuming that others share my views. :-)
  Reliable ways of recognising idiots are always at a premium.

So for those who are fond of d00d sp34k - by all means proceed.
