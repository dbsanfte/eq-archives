I wouldn't even bother with the tooth in the WL circle.  Since a
Cobalt Scar tooth works for all dragon circles, and he's going through
Cobalt Scar anyway, AND there is no see-invis, likes to eat people in
one bite, only a bard with a good drum could even think about
outrunning dragon who happens to frequent the dragon circle in CS, I
would bypass that silly WL tooth.
