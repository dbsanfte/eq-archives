Step one: go to the zone line that leads out to Lake of Ill Omen,
camp out.

 Step two: create halfling cleric, level up to five, when you get
Gate.  Get bind in Freeport.

Step three: go to Oasis, get on the barrel barge when it arrives

Step four: when the barge zones you in to Timorous Deep, get off
and swim to the SW corner, find the Firepots room.  Activate
Divine Aura and drop through to the floor

Step five: once DA has worn off, go to the large gold vase in one
corner, and click on it.

Step six: Camp out, have Iksar camp in.  Drop the shroud on the
ground.  Camp out, have cleric camp in.  Pick up shroud.  Gate
back to Freeport.  Find a safe spot, where your monk is camped
out.  Drop shroud on ground, monk logs in and picks it up.

Elapsed time 5 hours more or less
