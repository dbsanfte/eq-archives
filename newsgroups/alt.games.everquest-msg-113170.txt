Good choices mate.
You will have more fun/loot/xp if you can drag some friends with you though.
Get enough and you could take one of the nice camps in LGuk. If not, try to
solo the basalt gargoyles near the dead-to-live side tunnel. Could be tough
at your level, but I managed it with lots of roots :).
The back stairs in Mistmoore is a great solo area. Just go through the jail,
through the fake wall and up the stairs. The avenging caitliff spawns here
and drops the crested spaulders and helm. then proceed through the torture
room which has two spawns which are undead in the night time (drop quickly
under your ghoulbane and instrument of nife), and during the day a caster
and melee type which can be taken easily by rooting the melee and
stun/bashing the caster. After this continue up the stairs to a 2 gargoyle
pop. then down some more stairs to two more gargoyles. This is a great, and
reasonably safe, run that is good until about 43-44. Bring a map if you
havent been there before, cos xicotl is in a room just off the first
gargoyle pop, and hes a mean one! If there are peeps there killing the
advisor or princess, ask if you can loot the Soulfire hilt off Xicotl when
they drop him.
