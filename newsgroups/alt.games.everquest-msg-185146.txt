Got same problems here Qumamdar.
Almost ever since bazaar came out, i been having my mule in bazaar when 
i sleep at when im at work (only 1 PC and 1 account, so hes selling when 
i dont play), and never had any serious LD problems.
Since last patch, I have not yet had a single night where hes not back 
at desktop (and last night, at the char select screen, go figure) when i 
wake up (or if i wake up and need something to drink, then i log him on 
again, had a night where he was kicked 3 times in 1 night). Never had 
that problem before.
But its not the only zone i got problems in. In BoT, my druid (only BoT 
flagged char) go LD after camping out, can sit and camp, game count down 
to 5, 5 more sec and i go LD. And were talking every time i try, not 
just once in a while. And its only zone this happens in. Also started 
since last patch.
