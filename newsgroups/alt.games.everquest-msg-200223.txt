XP sucks compared to PoP zones, but, I do solo Nadox off and on.  There are 
spells to be had, 2 for each spell casting class I believe, which require 
lots and lots and lots of mind numbing killing of mobs.  They would 
actually be a challenge to someone of appropriate level, but, at level 62, 
only a few of the mobs that drop the spell components are actually xp 
giving mobs for me.

I do have a Coral Ring from Nadox, and, have gotten a few twink items as 
well.  So far, while I've been hunting there, have gotten one charm, which 
was pretty useless to me, but the enchanter with me liked it.
