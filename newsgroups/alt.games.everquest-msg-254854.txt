In a thread a week or so ago, I held forth that stun worked as a sort of 
ghetto slow, preventing the mob from doing damage during some of a fight.

Someone responded that the effect wasn't as large as I'd said, because 
mob weapon delay cycles whether he's stunned or not.

To paraphrase, my original idea would mean that a 4 second stun every 12 
seconds would be the equivalent of a 25% slow, as it would stop attacks 
for 4 seconds out of every 12.

The response would mean that given a mob weapon delay of 3, you'd either:

1: mob attacks
2: stun lands
3:
4: mob's weapon delay has cycled, but he's stunned
5: mob still stunned
6: stun wears off, mob hits

1: mob attacks
2:
3: stun lands
4: mob's weapon delay has cycled, but he's stunned
5: mob still stunned
6: mob still stunned
7: stun wears off, mob hits

1: mob attacks
2:
3:
4: stun lands, mob's weapon delay has cycled but he's stunned
5: mob still stunned
6: mob still stunned
7: mob still stunned
8: stun wears off, mob hits

so depending on when the stun lands, you delay the strike by either one, 
two, three, or four seconds, an average of two and a half seconds per 12 
seconds, or only a 12.5% slow

Looking over my logs, though, I find that the mob seems to always take 6 
or 7 seconds between blows if stunned with my 4 second stun., never the 
only 4 second delay you'd expect in some cases if this is correct.

If the stun does stop mob delay from cycling, though, then I'd expect 
just what I'm seeing; 3 second delay cycle plus 4 second stun.

I've been chain stunning while fighting recently, and certainly notice a 
very markable difference between fighting a mob while stunning and while 
not, something on the order of 25% instead of something closer to 10% 
sure seems to be happening (when I run out of blunt axes mob DPS goes up 
very noticably)
