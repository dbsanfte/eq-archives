Unless you can cite facts and sources to back this up (And be sure you
cite something that says definitively that it's in EVERY case), then I
say bullshit. In fact, this is the first I've ever heard this, so I'm
left to assume you pulled it straight from your ass.

You've made all these statements about how it's due to chemical
imbalances (despite the fact that, to my knowledge, no scientific
study has ever shown this), retardation (never mind the highly
intelligent homosexuals that are out there), and so forth but, yet
again, provide no backing to such statements.

Make all the assumptions and theories you want, but don't state them
as FACTS unless you have something to back them up with.

Your logic means that masturbation, birth control, and sex between
partners that are either one or both infertile is "abhorant" to
nature.

ALso, I never said you WERE a member of the KKK, Nazis, etc. I said
that the tripe you spewed was identical to the logic that backs their
philosophies.
