I haven't been able to play EQ since the Luclin upgrade.  I received
Luclin as an early Christmas gift, but haven't been able to install it
because I know my system won't run it very well.  Heck, I can't even
run EQ without Luclin at the moment really.  I have a Voodoo3 card,
which used to be just fine.  I'd like to upgrade to a good video card,
but I believe all the good ones are AGP and I only have PCI slots in
my system.  

Would anyone be able to recommend a good PCI video card which will
enable me to run Luclin with little to no problem?  Any help would be
very appreciated.  Thank you.
