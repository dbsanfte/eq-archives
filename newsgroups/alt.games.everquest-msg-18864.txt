Actually my shortest cast time on spells later is longer than yours,
and I take into acount the delay before being allowed to cast again
and the fact that you may (often) have to cast snare twice then fear
twice or more.

Cast snare, damn didn't stick!  Send pet, pet gets beat on by a MoB
that hit s for 100 damage and triples or quads (up to 300 or 400
damage a round).  My best pet has less than 2000 HP now.

Run to a safe point turn and snare again.  Snare does not taunt MoB
so all the while beating my pet for the same damage as above.  Pet
down to half life or much less now.  Cast fear.  It sticks great, it
doesn't cast DOT while waiting to be able to cast fear again.  Pet
is getting the crap kicked out of him so I check to make sure gate
is still memmed.

Many times I survive this and pet dies.  The trouble is that when
pet dies it creates a long period of downtime to get new pet and
mana back up to a point where I can pull for my pet again.  This
wastes time and the SOW potions I have to buy until I get Jboots.

I don't use the root technic some one else here mentioned because I
can't seem to get root to last more than a few seconds and so it
just wastes mana.  I try to kill with as few spells as possible that
way I can hunt nearly non-stop with CoB and Lifetap/Leach spells.

If all goes well I can kill a MoB with 569 mana and still just out
damage my pet.  To be sure I do out damage my pet I call him off at
near the end and let the DOT finish the job.
