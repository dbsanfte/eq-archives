We can but hope that Both of them live up to expectations.
What is amusing is that you seem to think we fear change...au contraire,
most of us can't wait to see both, EQ is old, it's dated, it's poorly and
inefficiently coded and it is STILL the best MMORPG available, that's why we
still play it, as soon as a new game comes along that is better we'll be off
like rats from a sinking ship. We are consumers not loyal subjects.

Yes, anyone that could afford to upgraded further than that.
Which kind of ruins that line of being to cheap to buy a new system, if
SWG/EQ2 requires more power (and assuming they're any good) then a new
system will be acquired.

Anyone that comes into a newsgroup, who's subject matter is clearly stated
in the title, and posts negative comments with no real arguements or basis,
whether it's EQ, BF1942, FA, NFL or Britney, fuckin, Spears, is a
troll...Face it you post was neither constructive nor original, we've seen
it before with AO and DAoC...lets hope that the next gen of MMORPG's *are*
an improvement.

Useful reading, maybe?

Ooh I'm cut to the quick, no really, no troll has ever used that line
before...please, whatever you do, don't insult my mother as well
