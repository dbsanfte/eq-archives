Well, I am having a hard day today at work (telephone tech support at an
ISP) and it is forcing me to re-examine my previously held belief of live
and let live. I am normally one of the loudest voices for "who cares what
other people do and think" but after 4 years ISP, burnout is setting in and
one particular issue is changing my outlook:

Intellect assault. It has exactly the same effect as smacking someone in the
head with your fist. Being intellectually assaulted hurts the brain. Really,
try it one day, watch "Jerry Spinger" and you will see (but keep an aspirin
handy).Why is this not regarded legally identical to physical assault? For
example...

Me: "Do you have a wall phone or a regular handset?"
Them: "Eh? What do you mean?"
*whack*

Me: "What operating system are you using?"
Them: "Windows 97"
*wham*

Me: "What email program are you using?"
Them: "What does that mean without the jargon?"
*kick*

Them: "We will just need to check a few settings"
Them: "I have a Mac, I don't need those"
*gouge*

Them: "The internet is broken"
*elbow*
*uppercut*
*roundhouse*

Me: "I can assure you that you cannot connect to the internet when you are
having a blackout"
Them: "Why not - the phone still works"
*bash*
(seriously, this has happened to me... twice)

Them: "It cannot be my end - we have changed nothing in over 3 years"
Me: "What operating system did you say you had?
Them: "Windows XP Proffessional"
*thwunk*

And those are just the tip of the iceberg's tip. What is wrong with
humanity? Why is it always the stupidest people that have to have everything
repeated to them 3 times because there are screaming kids everywhere on
their end? Are the two previous questions directly related?

*takes a deep breath*

...But, most importantly, when I do snap, when I do get that one intellect
assault too many and become forced to drive over to their place, force feed
their kids to them (steam boat) and bludgeon them to death with a frozen
Mackeral, why oh why can't I claim self self defence?

Me: "But Your Honour, they were stupid. They used Windows 97."
Judge: "What's wrong with that? We have that in the chambers..."
Me: "Nooooooooooooooo...."

Anyway, my lunchbreak is over. Once more into the breach...
