A group of fifties would have no problem.  I dropped him with the following
group:  51 Warrior ( Barbarian dual-wielding a wurmy and a venomous axe of
the velium brood) , 50 Warrior ( ogre not sure of weapons but LVL 40 did get
xp on a kill from him before grouped so they could not be that good) , 40
Warrior ( barbarian dual-wielding a lammy and a wurmy) and a 35 Druid (wood
elf ) and a 44 Druid ( wood elf) .  We did it and you 'll have no problem.
In fact we did it several times.  Druids just healed and LVL 51 pulled just
to the left of the gate on the hill.  Lower characters were twinked but
can't let brother's character go poor.  Watch out for the wandering drolvarg
that wanders off the hill to the fort many thought him tougher than the
Mountain giants!
