Near most cities and in a few other spots, you'll find a pedastle with a book
on top.  Click pedastle to port to Plane of Knowledge.  This zone is open to
all, and non KOS to all, and the only way to die seems to be via falling down
an elevator shaft.

To get to the hunting planes, go to the Plane of Tranquility pedastle and
click on that.  Another "safe" zone, but this one requires level 46+.

From there, you can find entrances to a whole pile of zones, but initially
can only enter Disease, Innovation, Justice, and Nightmare.

Its difficult for anyone under 60 to find a group, although there are plenty
of mobs that can be hunted in those first tier zones by a group much lower in
level.  If you can "bring your own group" you could probably manage great exp
off yard trash mobs in PoD or PoJ with a high 40s low 50s group, although
they hit hard and have lots of HP, the exp per mob will be fantastic.  PoN
and PoI also have mobs you could take, but both are train central, and those
trained mobs hit so hard you'd be constantly recovering from rez, which
really cuts your exp per hour rate down.

Most caster classes have one or more new spells that can only be purchased in
the PoK library, and are "no drop" once purchased.  Clerics get one at 19 and
another at 39 (sadly, same line, so only one new ability) so there's a good
chance that at minimum you get a spell you can use that noone without PoP
has.

You can also turn in any PoH/PoF class armor you no longer need, for a big
exp boost and a valuable gem.

Best thing about the PoP expansion for many people is the transport system,
go from any city to PoK and back down to any city, no waiting, no begging, no
paying.  Course this matters less if you spend most of your time in PoP!
