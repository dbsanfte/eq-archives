    Servitor might drop it, too. The guide I use is this: if it drops "an
orb of Luclinite", then in general it can drop Moonfire.

    And the price should drop within a month or two. We've seen a ton of
copies since they upped the drop rate, and we really don't have that many
druids. So they're being sold. Pretty soon the rich druids will all have a
copy (or their guilds will start killing things that drop it) and it'll
start to trickle down.
