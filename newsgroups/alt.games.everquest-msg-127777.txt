My Wiz on FV.  Lately, while soloing HGs in Rathe, I've been getting a bit
of that.  I get in, snare, start running to get some distance before I nuke,
Jboots in effect.  HG, being no where near me to hit me, all of a sudden
develops plasticman powers and wacks me.  I've looked around each time and
verified that there were no other HGs near me except the one that was
chasing me.  I stop and the HG continues to close for a sec or two before it
can wack me again.  Weird.
