I can think of a not so bizarre reason. When you use "behind-the-curtains"
features like /who or /ooc, you're not really roleplaying, are you? I
suppose a hardcore roleplayer would rely solely on the abilities and senses
of his character. If he wants to group, he'll run around and only speak with
characters he can actually see.

I'm speaking without knowing the first thing about roleplaying, of course,
but why would that stop me :-)
