Ok I can't remember if this happened prior to me applying the MS AMD fix 
(to address crashing to the desktop, which still happened so apparently it 
didn't fix it), but when sprites are right in my face there's horrid 
slowdown. A good example would be if I am close to a bard who's singing 
and one of those huge blue sprinkling things comes in my view (particle 
density must be at max), *everything* slows down - the mouse pointer, 
typing in to chat box, etc. Is this common? It reminds me of something 
like in Half-Life when there's lots of blood splatter decals on a wall and 
I walk right up to it, everything stutters and slows down, even sound 
skips. I have a nice system overall and a GeForce4 Ti4600 to top it off, 
but I've seen sprite problems like this with any game where they get close 
to the view and with a variety of video cards on a variety of operating 
systems over the years. What's the deal? Have video card manufacturers not 
addressed such issues?
