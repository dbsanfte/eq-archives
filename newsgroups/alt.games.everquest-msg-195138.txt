hi all, i was wondering if a hot key can be made that would let me assist my
pet? im a beastlord. i have typed in assist and had my warder targeted and i
will assist him. but i was wanting to know how i could make a hot key that i
could just push one time and i would assist my warder.

thank you much in advance for any help.

commands?
