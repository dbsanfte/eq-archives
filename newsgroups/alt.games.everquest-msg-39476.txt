First, you'll need to get the card out and find out the model number.  It's
probably either traced on the circuit board in white lettering, or on a
sticker.  It should read CSxxxx or something similar.  You can get an
updated/new driver at www.cirrus.com.  The previous poster wasn't right
about his facts, but he had a good point.  Crystal audio cards have always
been super low-cost integrated chips that were put into most major PC
manufacturer's machines at one time.  I've dealt with quite a few in my
years fixing computers, and the jury has ruled that they're generally pretty
crappy cards.  Cantankerous, and not always 100% SB compatible.  You can get
a basic SB16 these days for around 10 bucks, and it would save tons of
headaches.
