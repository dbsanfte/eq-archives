I used to live in the small town in Winona, Minnesota.  There are many
people there who hunt and the deer that they kill makes a huge difference in
their food bills and their lives...  Do the ABSOLUTELY need that deer, most
probably don't, but without it, their families may not have as much access
to things most of us consider 'normal'...  That meat ends up on the table
and they are thankful for it...
