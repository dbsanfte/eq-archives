> How many druids can port around Luclin

    You need people to port around Luclin? As has been well-documented here,
I'm about the most timid cleric around when it comes to running places.
Luclin is my dream expansion. Everything is within a few minutes run of The
Nexus (with Run Speed one, no less!), and can be gotten to with the few
tools I have available as a cleric (ITU, Divine Aura to run through the
mixed bag of mobs at Umbral zone, a permanent EB item for The Grey, and big
HPs to absorb the odd bump and knock along the way). Really, if I'll run
there you KNOW it's easy to get to.

    With AA points you have a nearly 1 K heal. Lots of guilds work with fast
heals combined with a "skeleton" CH group, or even no CH group. You aren't
capable of mind-numbing efficiency, but you can heal.

    And that's glossing over having a mana regen buff you can give others,
the best CR/FR buff in game, a stackable FR debuff, regen buff, strong
ability to nuke and DoT when compared with other casters... you have a
place.

    What you seem to want is a "make druids necessary" ability. There's a
difference.
