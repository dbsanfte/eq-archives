I said "in some cases"... the baby planes aren't exactly brimming
with high exp mobs.  And soloing classes aren't the slowest
levelers either.

If you bring a single group in to PoF and clear the place, you'll make
pretty decent exp.  Now, if you bring that same group and four
others, but your group gets every kill, you'll get the same exp, only
much faster, I hope.

Apply the same concept in AR or the Deep or OS Juggs (clearing
down to Trak/UDB for example) and you will see very decent
exp gathered.  The math is simple and inescapable, anything
that would be good exp per hour for a group of six is great
exp per hour when a group of 24 is doing the killing and the same
group of six is getting all the exp.  If you aren't killing at least
three times as fast with four times as many people, then you
are doing something drastically wrong.
