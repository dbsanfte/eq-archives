We've all experienced that slave feeling, I'm sure. However, if the
game leaves you wanting more, a take this to mean that you do still
enjoy it.

My advice would be to keep the account active, and keep it to
yourself. With a new child on the way, you'll no doubt need a place to
escape to from time to time, and Norrath is a pretty good place for
that.

cool item beckoning.

I've never had the patience/skill for this myself, but I know people
who have done some truly amazing things just by making shrewd trades.

Put the money in your new child's college fund. You'll be a lot
happier with that decision in the long run.
