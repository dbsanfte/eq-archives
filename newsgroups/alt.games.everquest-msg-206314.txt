Short answer: no.

Long answer: Ignoring the fact that socials are stored in INI files, not 
XML format, you seem to be confused on what XML itself actually does.  It's 
a standard way of storing and/or transmitting data.  What you can actually 
do with XML is determined by the program interpreting it: in this case the 
EverQuest client.  Unfortunately SOE has not really provided us with even 
rudimentary programing devices, such as control structures, much less an 
internal RNG.
