When the protectors of growth spawn they add every kos person in the zone to
there hate list . It takes the protectors a fairly long time to get from
where they spawn to the first person on the list to whack . If you buff or
heal anyone on that list you have aidied the enemy and are added to the hate
list . When that protector died you take the faction hit . The faction hits
are huge but not total . You have to fuck up more than 5 times to go kos.
