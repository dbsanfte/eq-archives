Well, the "not getting anyone killed" thing is quite considerate of you,
and much appreciated. I do have to wonder, though, about the "learning
the class" part.  How much about a bard would you say you are
experiencing and learning so far, playing only by yourself (in one of
the most versatile group classes there is) and having post fifty buffs
and protection on you at all times?

Before you take that as some sort of flame bait, I'm asking a serious
question about your experience thus far. Bard is arguable one of the
hardest classes to play, and dealing with their many jobs in a dynamic,
fast pulling group with other key classes (who you need to fill in for)
coming and going, how do you find your learning experience? It sounds to
me, while admittedly never having gone the PL route so I don't know,
like you're gaining the levels in a damned tough class to play and not
getting the opportunity to do any of those thing for "on the job
training", so to speak.
