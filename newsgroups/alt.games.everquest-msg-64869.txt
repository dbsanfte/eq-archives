I saw something about that they hoped to make a targetable /pick
command to decide how other people should appear to you, and don't
think I really like that.. I think it should be a player's prerogative
to decide how he or she should appear to others.
As for /facepick, how exactly does that work? Do you get one shot at
choosing your face, or can you redo it some other time? (Also
presuming that meddling with facepick won't affect the way you look if
you turn off the graphic for your race/gender :) )

Another thing that concerns me about the Luclin graphics - judging by
the screenshots I've seen, it looks like they've done away with the
velious graphics and have only one type of leather/chain/plate look.
Return of the boring leather... I guess they just don't like seeing
female woodelf druids covered up properly.  (Please, someone tell me
they've seen velious patterns with the Luclin graphics...)
And it seems like every female plate chestplate has vast amounts of
strategically placed extra padding. The High elf female screenshot I
saw was grotesque. And the male Erudite conehead? *shudder*
At least a lot of the chain armors look nice - I have pictures of wood
elf females in leather (aka silicon valley) and in something that
looks like it might be tinted chain and it doesn't look anywhere near
as nice as the female Barbarians. I have a picture of a female barb
shaman with green sleeves, legs and boots, a chain tunic and white,
braided hair, and she looks stunning. (Real incentive to play my level
2 barb shaman one day in the future there)
I'm now dreading the day my black gnomeskin-T shirt is nerfed to a
black dominatrix strap thingy...
