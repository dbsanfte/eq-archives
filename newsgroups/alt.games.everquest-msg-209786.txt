Factioning from KOS is always hard. And its almost invariably a lot of 
work, rarely is it a 'quick quest or two' often you have to kill 
hundreds of green mobs or do a tedious quest hundreds of times. (With 
sneaks, lulls, invis, illusions, etc you  can sometimes manage quests 
even from KOS.)  FWIW I think killing the greenbloods is on the faction 
you need too.

If your objective is just to level and make some cash head elsewhere. 
With a good group you could take beetles in unrest (good xp... lousy 
cash), or hunt the Karanas (lions, spiders, beetles, wolves...), 
crushbone and blackburrow are classics for 7th level....

As a DE... East Commons, North Ro, Nektulous Woods, and maybe even 
lavastorm are also all good, not to mention the Warrens or Kerra Island 
on Erudin, or the upper bits of Befallen, or even the field of Bone in 
Kunark.

The point is there is quite a bit of content for low level players... 
most of it largely ignored in favour of fast-easy-levelling(tm).

As a DE Necro BBM is probably not the best place for you.... if you 
aren't a twink head back home and do your newbie quest armour !! Once 
your done that I'd check out the warrens... as DE Necro it shouldn't be 
too much work killing kobolds to get enough faction to get into the city 
of Paineel.

Good luck,
