Without a snare effect... but fortunately I have a quite servicable 
snare effect available as a berserker from level 6 up, I can land a 
snare on demand about 90% of the time, lasts about a minute and has a 
reuse timer of only 12 seconds, which is admittedly a long time if you 
have a runner (or worse a feared mob) and get a resist (the warning 
message is Avoided actually), but not bad at all if you're just trying 
to keep the mob snared.

I don't want it to save me, so much as to save me down time.  Taking on 
a mob which I can beat toe to toe, but then slapping a fear onto it so I 
go toe to back for a while, dishing out damage while not taking any, 
will cut the amount of damage I take in the fight.  I've seen it work 
the dozen or so times its actually gone off... and I've seen it turn 
things into a disaster when its gone off in a bad spot because I was 
practicing it and just expecting it to not go off (as it so rarely does)

What I've recently heard is that Intimidate works in part off your skill 
in Kick.  Bards reportedly get Intimidate but not kick, for example, and 
so find the skill useless.  Monks on the other hand, often having 
excellent Kick skill, report it to be fairly reliable at high levels; a 
contradiction when the monk and bard have the same skill level in 
intimidate.

If this is true, that means raising Intimidate to useful levels requires 
also capping out Kick, which is a pain for a berserker because Frenzy is 
on the same timer as Kick, and does a good deal more damage (getting 20 
points usually, and sometimes 40 points with some mysterious double 
effect, as opposed to at best 6 points with kick)
