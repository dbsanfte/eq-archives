It was a blackjack for 25 plat (others were 70 plat) and Lore wasn't a

I will have to try what the other poster tried and carry twice as much
as needed and see if that solves the problem. At least one other time,
there was a nice item that I wanted and the Buy button was grayed
under similar circumstances.

Thanks all.
