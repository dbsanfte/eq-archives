My monk got from 12-19 in Kurns, and my chanter got from 11-17 there 
(levelled with friends). Only had the pleasure of meating morons one time.

My chanter, and my warrior and shammy friend are fighing at the entrance 
level, running around the big room and pulling what we can find. Then 2 
guys show up, and after trying to KS us 2 times (mobs we were already 
fighing, wont call it KS if someone try to take a mob in the other end 
of the entrance room) they decide to move to the next floor instead.
4 min after they come running down again with a few skellys, and come to 
us shouting for help. I mezz the skellys, and they promptly break mez, 
and i remezz. That at least bought us time to finish the mob we were 
killing before helping the morons. So we beat the mobs up to save them, 
and they start to shout about us KS them.
We inform them that we dont plan to help them again if thats the thanks 
we get, and go back to our own killings.

A few min later they come running with a few more skellys and try to 
train us, they begin to just run around me to get the mob to aggro on 
me. But appearantly they dont know that much about skellys, and how hard 
it is to get them to change targets, so they dont manage to get it to 
aggro me, and they both die while trying to train us. We then of course 
kill the mobs they came running with.
5 min later they manage to get back to Kurns, and promptly begin to 
bitch about us letting them die.

We didnt even bother to respond to them after that. Appearantly they 
learned enought from that death to try and train us again, so we didnt 
have any more problems.
