Has anyone confirmed exactly what the changes are yet ?
If VI have any sense (lol) they will only change mobs that are quest
mobs and merchants / traners etc. (i.e. the sort of mob that you can
accidently give (wrong) items to)
That would fix the problem of people loosing items accidently.

Regarding the second part of what they are fixing (giving items to
killable mobs) there is a double issue. That you can give naff items to
some mobs to cripple them or you can give great weapons ot some mobs to
cripple players (greif).
Seems to me that if Mobs were slightly more intellegent (eg picked
wepons by ratio not delay) then half of this would be solved. And
personally I don't think that the greif part has ever been much of a
problem. (and now that the low levels are so easy it is even less of a
problem at that end of the spectrum)

I must stop now as I have used mu quota of parenthesis for the day.
