My local paper did cover the hoax part of the story as did the internet
newswires I get on my homepage. So what? This story and your repugnant
racial slurs have nothing to do with this newsgroup, and in fact such
abusive language would be in clear violation of the Terms of Use policy and
you would be ejected from EQ for saying such things. This story is
indicative of one disturbed individual, not some conspiracy that somehow
includes the majority of newspaper publishers in an effort to smear the good
name of your beloved KKK. If you wish to espppuse theories on racial justice
please do so on a different Newsgroup, that sort of thing has no place here.
