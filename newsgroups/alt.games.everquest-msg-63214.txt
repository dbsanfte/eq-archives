 All of the VP dragons, actually. No telling how many of those it takes.
I've gotten at least 60 +VS hits now off of Kunark dragons and I'm still
KoS. Oh, add Trakanon and Severilous as well. Basically all the Kunark
dragons and Esorpa in WW. I'm come to the conclusion that killing
dragons is not an effective way to get non-kos there, unless you're not
too deeply kos to begin with. If you've maxxed negative, good luck.

 If you can sneak you may be able to get away with it with the help of a
friend. I haven't tried it yet but it seems like it would work. Have
someone hail Rotgrime so he faces the same way as the marines, then
sneak behind and you should be able to be in trading distance. The bad
thing about that is that Rotgrime will turn and walk to the other end,
whether he's being hailed or not.
