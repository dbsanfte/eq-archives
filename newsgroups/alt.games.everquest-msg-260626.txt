Really? Wow. I'm surprised so many people didnt know about it.

For what its worth, i think they're a gigantic waste of time.

You have to do 100 successes at each of 5 or 6 stages iirc.

Given that each stage is worth roughly 10 skillups, and you need 100 
turn ins at each stage to get to the next stage. After factoring fail 
rate you probably have to do closer to 150 combines at each stage.

Meaning its around 900 combines for 54 skill.


Worse, if you already have 16 skill (from combining spider silk for 
example)... you still have to start at the beginning, afaik.

Its far faster to just drop some skill points into it to 20, and then 
work it to 54 the old fasioned way. The cost of combines at such low 
levels is nominal. Even non-twinked characters with just their own cash 
are probably better off paying for it. Hell, even working it from zero 
could take less time, and for some trades (like baking you'd even be 
able to use the results). Maybe for tailors it would be worth something, 
as most of the recipes are mob drops...but you're far better off 
skilling up on spider silks etc... at least the hour or two farming silk 
and pelts would be profitable if you sold the results.

I don't know, maybe I'm too down on them, but they were so mindnumbinly 
stupid. It was really disappointing. I think it would be great to quest 
for TS skillups, even at the low levels... but this wasn't a fun quest 
it was just an RSI inducing time sink. I saved a few plat on the 
skillups I guess... was it worth it? I didn't think so.

Out of curiosity, have -you- done them? Or did you just read the 
walkthru?
