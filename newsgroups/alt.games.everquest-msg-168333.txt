Well, that's pretty much the equivalent of trying to achieve powered 
flight by strapping carboard wings to your arms and jumping off a cliff. 
The results would be, undoubtedly, interesting...

The only way to make PvP fair enough to be enjoyable in an RPG is to 
restrict the instances of possible PvP to characters within a narrow 
range of power (as is the case now in all but Sullon Zek). Because this 
opens itself to an unmanageable number of exploits (such as off-party 
healers, and stuff like that), the only practicable solution is to 
narrow the range of power to make it match the range of PvP.

And no, I think that a "narrow" RPG, where the highest character was no 
more than five times as powerful as the lowest could be extremely 
interesting too. In EQ, the only thing that changes at the high-end is 
raid mechanics, otherwise the only difference is that the numbers get 
bigger... And the only reason there aren't low-level raids (like 
Muglwump in Warrens could easily be) is that higher-level characters 
come around and casually stomp on those lowbie raid mobs without 
breaking a sweat.
