If you have ldon do the dungeons alot !
Seems to have for virgin non twinked toons some decent gear for your level
as you level up .
Get a MOSS for your 1hb if cheap just get a centi short sword to raise up
1hs
For peircing a embalming dagger for the free bandages and a centi 2hp for
piercing  they darn cheap
for 2hs get a weighted halberd nice cheap and affordable plus it gets better
in stats as you level up
