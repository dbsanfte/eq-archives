Its not a couple of seconds tho, it can be kept rooted "ghetto-mez" away
from your party for as long as is needed.

As to which would I prefer?  Well it depends on the situation.. id rather
have Dlammaz rooted out of range, than slowed and in my camp as an add
(those quad 500s are still enough to fuck you up, slowed or otherwise)

Of course when its just my group versus Dlammaz, I obviously want him slowed
more than root, snare, etc matters

Don't take what I say the wrong way, its certainly not meant as a slam on
you.

At 65 tho, the "vital spell" list changes (as im sure it does at many points
through the game.. how long before charm, mez and slow become *lifesavers*
over all other spells?).. and now at the 65-PoP exp level, root is as
invaluable (more so in a lot of occasions) than mez for crowd control.

When you group with a chanter now in PoP its for their UNGODLY dps, crowd
control comes as a distant thought :)  (about to be slightly-nerfed)

I wouldn't do PoV caves without a mezzer, I wouldn't do CT-4c without one
either.. or even PoF..  thats when mez is one of the "best" spells in the
game.  Exping in the rest of PoV, in HoH etc though, root is > almost
everything (id say slow, charm, root is the vital order in HoH)

Certainly my saying "root and snare are maybe the best 2 spells in the game"
was incorrect.. I stand by the thought "root and snare can be the 2 best
spells in the game" tho.
