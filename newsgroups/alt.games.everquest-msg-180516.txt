Let's back up.

Someone, I haven't even got a clue who anymore, posted asking the 
question in the title.  DT, among others, answered.  The person I had to 
plonk TWICE responded freaking out and claiming DT was a racist because 
he referred to certain cultures as 'sub sets' of the human race.  Many 
people called the troll on their obvious lack of understanding of the 
English language.  Bla bla bla, thread spirals out of control, plonked 
idiot posts something that *could* be taken different from what it is 
intended, Freeman gives him dose of his own medicine.  Of course, I 
could be wrong, and Freeman could be cut from the same material as the 
original plonked idiot, but seeing has he has been a regular poster and 
I haven't plonked him yet - I'd be more willing to give him the benefit 
of the doubt than above-mentioned plonked idiot.
