That is why I always make them pay up front. Someone did that to me
once, once was enough. 

<player> ? are you going to port?
<me> Yes, I'm waiting for you to hand me the 40 plat
<player> wtf? 
<me> you know I can port, I don't know that you have 40 plat
<player> I only pay after the port
<me> *single ports away*
Player tells you  "okay, come back I'll give you 40 plat now"
<me> too late.

I always hand a cleric the 200 plat it took any of the bastards to
resurrect me ahead of time also. I know they can resurrect, they came
to my corpse to resurrect, its just a show of good faith.
