So, I lack forethought?

I disagree. I think that maximizing mana efficiency, i.e. not wasting
mana, shows forethought. Healing your entire group to 100% hp is a
waste of mana.

This is, of course, a generalization. A Cleric with full mana is also
wasting mana, so healing to "bleed off the excess" may take your group
to 100% hp and not be an inappropriate waste mana.

So, I'm not worth my salt?

In many situations, probably most situations, it is simply not
possible for a lone healer without a mana regen buff to keep the
entire group at 100% hp and still have a sufficient mana pool to
address healing needs that are likely to arise.

This does, of course, depend on circumstances. A slow pulling group
will allow plenty of med time between pulls to make this possible.
But, in a moderate to fast paced XP group, 100% hp for all group
memebers is not sustainable indefinitely. Maybe you could keep it up
for a while, but eventually, you're gonna need a break.

4k mana? At 52? Caster's Realm tells me that my Cleric at 52nd level
with 190 wisdom has 2,080 mana. I have some gear with +mana, but I
don't think I have +2000 mana on anything. How were you getting 4k?

Far more secure than what? My group? Some other group with only 90%
hp? I've never had any complaints and I feel plenty secure.

I'll tell you exactly how you're wasting mana. You're tank is down
500hp. Unless you have a heal that heals exactly 500hp, the only way
to get him to 100% hp is to heal MORE than 500hp. That's wasted mana.

Wow, you sure think a lot of yourself. Do the groups you've played in
agree?

Let me relieve a burdon from you. You are not in the least bit
responsible for the level of fun anyone, other than yourself, is
having. Each player is wholly responsible for their own fun.

Are you saying that the level of concern a healer has for their group
can be measured by the per centage of hp the group as a whole has? Or
are you saying that the level of confidence a group has in their
healer can be measured this way? I hope neither, because both are
ludicrous.

Are you saying that since I do not routinely keep every member of my
groups at 100% hp that I have less concern for their well being then
you do?

You mean 4,000 mana at 52nd level? You may want to switch to a
calculator.

I agree. A Cleric's mana is both. That's why it should be used wisely.

I like haveing KEI myself. I simply don't solicit it. I don't waste my
time or my groups time acquiring it. Because of this, I've had KEI
maybe 5 times on my Cleric. It has forced me to rely on intelligent
mana management techniques rather than just healing everyone to full
whenever they get damaged.

Making your group "feel good" or topping off everyones hp may stroke
your ego, but it does nothing to improve your mana efficiency or make
you a better Cleric.
