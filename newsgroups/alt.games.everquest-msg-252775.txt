I'm not sure what you are saying really. If you mean to get a balanced
selection of good equipment you have to work all of the dungeons, I
agree. But some people seem to be quite comfortable doing just one
dungeon only. I don't agree with it, but that's what some people do.

The impression is that the Dungeon is almost all Undead. Not that
reality actually coincides with peoples expectations.

Personally I take a look at what equipment I need or want from LDoN
and then go after it. Usually this means kicking, begging, and
otherwise cajoling people into Dungeons other than Mistmoor. (I still
don't have all my Curse spells, damn it.)
