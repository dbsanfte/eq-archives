It's not clear that the "make mad cash" part and the "make new
friends" part are compatible.  Making mad cash will generally involve
finding people who are desparate for a port and reaming them on the
price, which generally doesn't get you on the friends list. :-)

Check into getting a horse rather than tboots.  Besides speed, horses
reportedly make it so that you are always meditating!  That would mean
no more staring at the spell book between fights.
