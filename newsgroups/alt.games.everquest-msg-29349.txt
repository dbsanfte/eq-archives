If the same rules applied then the game would become too easy.
It would also be ruined by exploiters.


EQ mob powers:

Mobs can teleport.

Mobs regenerate mana standing up and at a MUCH
faster rate than PCs can sitting down meditating.

Mobs can see through walls and can hit through them.

Mobs can ignore the z-axis when attacking PCs. In other
words a Mob can hit a PC will standing on the roof of
a building while a PC is INSIDE the building. The PC
cannot hit the Mob back in this situation.

All Mobs can breath underwater and never drown.

All Mobs take zero damage from falling, no matter
the height.

All mobs are immune to lava damage, if they fall into it.

A Mob can hit a PC if the PC is standing inside them,
A PC cannot hit the Mob.

PCs cannot shoot mobs with missile weapons if they
are above or below a certain height. Mobs can shoot
PCs from any height.

Mobs can cast damage spells without line of sight to a target.
PCs cannot.

Mobs can pass through PCs and other Mobs at will.
PCs cannot.


They can do all that to overcome one huge glaring flaw
that the Mobs have: They are as dumb as rocks.
