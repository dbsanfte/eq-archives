I thought that at 60 SKs get an additional FD spell with a very low
recycle, and that by using two FD spells, you can attempt, fail,
attempt, fail, attempt a lot faster than a monk.  Plus you have all
those HPs, which is nice when you're being cast upon and can't count
on your monk AC.
My guildleader, a dragon-pulling necro, started an SK twink just
because he's decided it's the ultimate pulling machine.  I just don't
think he has the drive to take a 2nd character to 60.
