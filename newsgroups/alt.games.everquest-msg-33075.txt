Yes it is. Depends on your channeling but you said you're only 31 so I'd 
have to say pretty slim.

But this wasn't implied (at least how I read it) in the original post. 
It sounded to me like a rant about how all tanks are stupid and don't 
care about the casters and casters have no responsibility to control 
aggro. At least that was MY initial take on it.

No, not at all. Not in the situation you described above. But it will 
probably save your life if you DO say something in that situation. Why 
depend on someone else to keep you safe. You really can't blame someone 
else for that.

It depends of course on how many and what kind of mobs are on the caster 
and what KIND of caster. A cleric such as yourself should be able to 
root and step back from a Tesch Mal or Mas without getting beat up <too> 
bad. Unless of course you've gone the wis route exclusively. But in the 
situation you described above you would be correct.

The caster should KNOW what kind of beating they can take. As most of 
the replyers in this thread have said - "make a hotkey" - is VERY good 
advice. Was this a pickup group? Was it people you've played with 
before? Bottom line is you should know you're OWN capabilities and err 
on the side of safety over death.

Then we'll let it drop here. As I said, I believe that most casters (or 
any player for that matter), should recognize what they can and can not 
handle. Don't place responsibility on YOUR well being with someone else 
when YOU can affect that outcome.
