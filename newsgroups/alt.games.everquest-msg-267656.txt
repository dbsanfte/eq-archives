Player guilds - when you join a guild, you can get city quests that,
when completed, award you Social Points.  These can be spend on
special items.

Also, if you are a Patron of your guild you also earn Guild Points,
which can be spent on the Guild directly - cheaper housing, cheaper
mounts, etc.

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
