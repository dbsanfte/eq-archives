Started this series for something interesting to do.  The
eventual end result looks worth getting for anyone who isn't
ultra twinked.

Phase one was simple enough even at level 4: bone chips, mosquito
wings, and forage mud crabs in LOIO.  The last was most annoying
because my forage skill is innate and won't go any higher ever
anyway, this meant I was stuck foraging but couldn't possibly be
getting skill ups while doing it.

I also discovered that the spawn rate in LOIO newbie area seems
much much higher than before, there were tons of mobs there.
Thinking of constructing a junior AOE Group sometime, you could
get 50 mobs together easy!

Anyway, this results in some crackers and the trigger phrase for
the next step, using the net I probably could have avoided it
entirely.
-------------------------------------------------------
Second step; get three skulls.  No clues at all how to do this
from the text.  Went to EQAtlas and looked into the matter, turns
out they drop off a mob in the sewers under the city; random rare
on the spawn tables so kill anything.  By this point I was 10th
level, so all the mobs were green to me.  I farmed for a while
and popped the outcast, killed him and got one of the skulls.

Then, bored with the green killing already, I made a beastlord
alt, handed him my oh sooooo twinky spiny warhammer (7/28, what
powah!) and had him do the work.  Turns out most of the mobs are
level one, and not KOS; only decaying skeletons will jump you,
and only Scorpions, a giant swamp leech, and the Iksar Outcast
himself are over level one.

At level 2 I popped another outcast and managed to kill him by
the skin of my teeth.  Another at level 3 was easy.  Sadly, a
duplicate of the skull I already had.  Got up to level 4 and
finally finished getting enough leech husks to complete the first
bracer of the beastlord quests, so I started yet another alt.

Necromancer.  Twinked him by giving him all the bone chips and
weapons that had dropped during the farming so far.  Sold a
couple weapons and bought a couple spells including the pet, then
brought him in.   Looks like my beastlord had been lucky with the
fish, or perhaps they count as animals and the beastlord gets a
free pass.  At any rate, it took necro a couple tries to get in
past them.  Summon pet, arm him with one of the weapons, and go
crazy... almost immediately spawning the outcast.  Well that
didn't work out, couldn't kill it with level one necro and level
one pet, niether could stay alive long enough, although we did
get thru half his HP before dropping.

Brought Shaman back in and had some trouble, weaponless (loaned
it to the beastlord, and everything else in the bank!) had to
rely on DOTs for most of my damage output... and when he's hurt
he runs, taking him thru a one way door I can't move thru!
Luckily sitting brought him back in range before he died so I
could loot.  Duplicate.

Necro again... and necro spawned outcast rapidly again!  I just
let outcast walk around while I kept fighting, hoping that
another level or two would allow me to outlast him.  So I
wandered thru one way doors, killing happily till I spawned
another outcast, then (at level 2) tried him,with no better
results.  So I brought in Shaman again for the kill, and got my
last skull on the first of the two outcasts.  Went and got my
cudgel upgraded, took my warhammer back from my beastlord
(upgraded cudgel is still inferior to warhammer, and looks like
it will be for several more steps of the quest) and went looking
for the next quest.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this one, you need a drop in WW, off mobs that were yellow
and came three at a time when I pulled (well not the target mob,
but the camp if I understand it right), one in FOB out of an area
with red and yellow mobs, forage in BW (Oh goody, more forage
work with my crappy forage skill and this time in a zone I can't
hope to hunt in) and most insane sounding, off a barracuda in the
lake in LOIO.  OK, don't level 40somethings hunt those cuda's for
exp?

I go from a camp thats challenging at level 2 to one that
requires killing level 12 mobs and one that might be in the high
30s, or at least surrounded by KOS mobs that are?

For a 4/27 1hb (didn't write it down but this is close)?

Seems nuts.
