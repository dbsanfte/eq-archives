I whined about this when I first noticed it. 10k damage drop and precarious
ledge but a zone with no Levitate. There is a mob/npc of note in a high
tower that you could "cheat" to reach by using levitate and or grav flux,
this is the reason for the no levitate rule.
I have also died in the zone, had one of those post-SoL stutters as someone
else zoned in and ran off the catwalk over the water. All that water and my
Druid found the ledge at the bottom of the supports, splat! Stupidly I went
to look with my Warrior and sent him over as well, he landed ontop of the
druid, druid took 10k damage and warrior took 76dam, I guess woodelf corpses
are soft /shrugs.
