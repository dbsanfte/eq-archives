It's important to make the distinction between FFA - free for all - and
FCFS - first come first served.

Strictly speaking, stealing a mob which is *already engaged* is KSing,
forbidden by policy, and (as far as I am aware) ALWAYS condemned by the
playerbase. So there is really no such thing as a FFA mob. (That said, the
South Ro AC usually ends up like that =))

To illustrate what FCFS means, consider an area in a dungeon with 6
precisely defined and known spawn points in a rectangle, and suppose that
there are well-known camps at both ends of this area. Here is an
illustration:

<X, an area that camp A pulls from>

Camp A

1    2

3    4

5    6

Camp B

<Y, an area that camp B pulls from>

Now, for some servers at some times, it might be regarded as implicit in the
definition of the camps that, say, mobs 1 2 3 4 'belong to' camp A, while
mobs 5 6 'belong to' camp B.

However, FCFS would say that mobs 1 2 3 4 5 6 don't 'belong to' anyone;
whoever engages them first is entitled to kill them.

The 'generally accepted' situation, as I have suggested, may vary with
server and time of day.

Note that even where the situation is regarded as FCFS, it might well still
be the case that generally everyone will agree that mobs in area X belong to
camp A, and mobs in area Y belong to camp B. It would be rare for a dungeon
to be completely FCFS - else there would be nothing to name the camps after
=)

This post has gone on too long so I will summarise: The poster who
originally said

> > >The mobs around the ramps in Velks are FFA.

in fact meant, I suggest, that those mobs are FCFS, and no matter where you
are sat you cannot claim someone has stolen 'your' mob, if it was standing
on its spawn point unengaged.
