    There are many people, myself included, who thing that EQ will soon be
knocked off the top of the hill.  It does have a certain inertial value
that give it the weight of numbers.  But people are leaving due to the
natural process of attrition, and the new players that are coming in have a
much wider choice of online games to play.

   I get it.  But there came a point for me, after *4 years* of play, when
the quests for the loot started to seem like work instead of fun.  I can
see how some other people with different perspectives might never come to
feel this way.  Anyways, I want to emphasis that I think that any game that
can give someone as flighty as myself 4 years of addictive gameplay is
clearly doing something right.

   But I am at the point where it seems profoundly refreshing to play a
game that has no loot to speak of.

> In a MMORPG, I enjoy the sense of adventure, of purpose and immersion.

   Purpose and immersion are indeed the things that are lacking in CoH, no
doubt about it.  As more content is added, this might change.  Unless you
define purpose as "getting good loot in the end", in which case CoH will
never fit the bill, unless it undergoes a massive reworking.

   Yep.  Me, I enjoy going in, doing the fight, and not having to worry if
the rare item I need for x quest drops, or if I might need to do the fight
again and again, maybe for hours at a time, before getting what I want.  I
go in, have fun with the fight, and then leave, not really caring much
about what dropped.  

   I think Dark Tyger is exactly right when he says that CoH is a niche
game.  You and I just happen to be in different niches, is all.  And I
would hazard to guess that you are in the bigger niche.  But... I don't
think that it's fair to say that most people who try CoH  will probably
feel the same way you did about the game.

   I think that numbers will be more than enough.  Heck, The Sims Online is
still up, and that was only a game in the loosest sense of the word.  I
tried it, hated it, and thought that it would fold within a year.  But it
is still up.  For some unexplained reason.

    Ah, then I can agree with that wholeheartedly.  I've stated in the
group before that I strongly believe that this sort of system would give EQ
a shot in the arm by reducing the need or worth of camping.  That and
getting rid of having different Zone Experience Modifiers that tempt
players to pack themselves into "hot" zones such as the Paladral Caverns,
rather than spreading out and actually seeing alot of the cool content that
the game really does have.
