This is too funny.  Are you on Tholuxe Paells?  When I was a young ranger I was
waiting on the boat for the first time.  I was really excited too!  Couldn't
wait to see the ocean, (boy was I naive).  Some guy started chatting with me on
the dock and told me that pirates sometimes invaded the boat, killed the
passengers and stole their stuff.  I ran all the way back to the bank to
deposit all my prized leather gear and vellium sword,  in case I got killed....
