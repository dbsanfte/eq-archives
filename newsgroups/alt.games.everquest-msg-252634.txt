Yes.

As Davian said the less things you're awarding points for the better
in general.

They're already getting points for being on time, this is redundant.

I prefer dkp blind bidding to this. Bidding self-corrects and doesn't
have the problem Davian mentioned, or at least to a much lesser
extent. We have the winning bid be equal to the second bid. And no
negative bidding! I dunno who first thought that was a good idea, but
its not. Bidding allows people who want an item earlier to spend more
to get it, but also allows people to bid on lesser items without
blasting their entire wad out the door.

...and we let people bid on anything until they are right out of dkp,
no limits on "per raid".

We do have a small number of equipments that are still meritted
instead of bid on (BoW for instance).
