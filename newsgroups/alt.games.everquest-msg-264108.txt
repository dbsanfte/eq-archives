"Never attribute to hostility what can be explained by stupidity" is a
phrase that used to be second only to Godwin's Law in ubiquity on
usenet.

I'll accept that Julie may have been guilty of forgetting that one if
you will, though...

I suspect you'll regret it more often than you are vindicated by it,
if you're balking on principle alone.  I also suspect that you'll
remember the vindications more than the regrets - helps support the
principle, after all.

I could be projecting my own experience on the matter, though.

Cute story, but there's one significant difference:  you and your
husband knew the reason behind that 'blacklisting'  and made a
reasonable judgement call based on experience.

In this case, you balked on principle alone.  Which is IMO no
different from joining on principle alone.
