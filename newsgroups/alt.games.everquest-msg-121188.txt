Yeah, we were buffed...about 1/5 of how much cheating NPCs were buffed.

You forgot to mention that shaman-type critters can also melee as good as,
or better, than your main tank, can sow themselves indoors, and has insane
channeling ability so that when he's NOT beating the snot out of you he can
cast a better DOT than YOUR shaman...and get it to stick on a player 15
levels higher.

It's pretty bad when the average NPC is now SMARTER than your average
PLAYER.

A melee with spells is a hybrid.  If they want to make things "consistent,"
they should take Complete Heal and Gate away from critters who cause major
melee damage.  Either that or give those spells to the hybrid players.
