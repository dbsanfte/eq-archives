  Which is bizarre.  Clinton basically let Al-Quaeda build it's network
up unimpeded and when hit by them bombed the people who tried tell him
about them.  Respecting Clinton is a big part of why americans shouldn't
take European ideas seriously.  He invaded all over the place but because
they didn't oil from the places he invaded it was OK by Europe.

  How about the murder of 80 people including over a dozen children?  
How about giving federal agents a license to murder?
