Just feel like preaching a little...

Having reached level 51 with my rogue a month ago, I was burned out.
Almost quit EQ all together on more than one occasion.  The guild I had been
in was small (8-10) and many of its players stopped playing.  This got to be
so depressing.  I had been leveling intensivly with a cleric and warrior and
our focus had been LEVEL...LEVEL...until we all got sick and bored with it.

After many weeks of barely playing, I returned and joined a new guild with
20-30 players in my level range and have begun to actively group with them.

I have to say that this past weekend was about the most fun I've had yet in
EQ.

Saturday was a guild raid of LGuk, levels 35 - 50+.  We managed 3 full
groups for this informal little raid and proceeded into the dead side.
Hacked and slashed our way to the frenzie room area. Killed all the frogs
there, then started on our way to the ghoul lord.  We spent the next few
hours working back and forth between the Lord and the Frenzie, killing all
in between.  Much fun and loot for all.

Sunday I was in Karnors Castle and spent the morning and evening in mostly
full guild groups.  The evening group was the best full group I've had yet,
53 warrior, 51 cleric, 48 bard, 51 shaman, 50 enchanter and myself (51
rogue).  What a POWER group.  We took the right court yard and let slip the
dogs of war!  The shaman had us so buffed that we were giddy with power and
the chanter kept the crowds mezzed and the MOB kitchen cupboard full. Made 4
blues in 51 in less than 3 hours!   I even got to experience my first
Gravity Flux as our whole group got bounced! A real WTF! momment but we all
survived and got a laugh out of it.  Towards the end, we even got to run to
zone as someone from the left court yard trained 6 mobs into a battle we
were having with 4!   The poor chanter had 4 or 5 callers mezzed, the
shamans pet was on a dog or two, the shaman was soloing a sentry.  The
warrior and I were trying to keep the OOM cleric free and after 20 seconds
of being stupid and ignoring my gut, Someone finally became un-cocky enough
to call RUN!
Well... I died.  I was in the lead running to zone shouting "train left!"
with about 5 mobs beating on me when I saw the worst.   The entire entry was
spawned and no one had cleared it ?!?!?! which is rare for KC.  So I picked
up 6-8 mobs there and led them left.  Got near south zone and died a few
feet from safety.  At least the rest of the group managed to zone north and
get out.

I had had so much fun that I was sitting there laughing in west freeport.
Got my rez 10 min. latter after our? train was finally gone... Yes, it
lasted 10 minutes as new peeps kept logging into that mess.  Never did find
out who added there mobs to ours and started the train but as we had 2 guild
clerics 49+ we offered to rez all for free.

so... in summary...finding a new guild with plenty of folks made the game
fun again for me. Also, not worring about leveling has made the game more
fun too.  I am just as willing to help run around SRO all night with a few
guildies for no exp. or getting into a exp group in the higher zones.  It's
all fun in the end.   Been giving most of my gains away to lowbies too which
I enjoy.  Oh well, enough spouting off.
