Actually, Shadeweaver is still great at 13.  Live in the Loda Kai
camp if you want to solo, or get a partner or two and go down
to the Loda Kai caverns.  By 15 you can solo there, and it
won't start to dry up till 17. Then get back up out of the cave
and go up past the Loda Kai tents to the -other- side of
Shadeweaver where you can hunt the Firefall Saureks and
Charred Corpses solo with a little care... or get  a group
and hunt them faster and safer as well as go after the Loda
Kai soldiers.

You can also probably do Ash Beetles over there at 15 or so,
but the corpses and firefalls are going to be real scary at that
level.  By the time those two are "merely" yellow, the Ash Beetles
are a dissapointingly easy blue

Then there's the whole Gor Taku/Shad Drakka question, again
lots of those running up in level, to the point where my 30 druid
who went scouting for me saw a -lot- of cyan and blue mobs... and
a few yellow and even a red.

Hollowshade also is an interesting zone, but the annoying green aggro
backstabbing rhinobeetles make it less enjoyable.
