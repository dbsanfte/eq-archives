That's the dictionary definition dumbass. The one I, unlike you, have
been following all along.

My definition hasn't changed, dumbass. Nor has your continued
ignorance.

Want to point out my changing definitions, dumbass, or are you content
to sit back and be shown to be full of shit?

Don't bother, I'll do it for you. Here's every instance of the word
acting in this thread by me, to expose, yet again, your extreme idiocy
to the world.

>>Probably much much higher. A lot of people are probably good actors
>>when they are allowed to be essentially anonymous without the
>>nervousness of having to perform in front of live people.

Already defined as being the same as roleplaying.

>>Because not everyone in the real world who has the potential to be a
>>good actor decides to be an actor.

And again.

>>Some of them do. Some of them just don't want to do it for money. I
>>would say a LOT of people *could* be good actors but just don't have

>>But in a RPG, pretty much everyone who feels like acting is going to
>>do it. It's part of the fun.

And again! Holy fuck, I'm being consistent! So, you ARE lying! Let's
keep going....

>>Roleplaying is acting.

Almost word for word from the dictionary now. I thought that would be
simple enough even for you, I was wrong. Idiocy knows no limits.

>>But among the population that isn't, most are
>>quite capable of "acting". And with both populations combined, the
>>amount of people capable of acting in an rpg with the benefit of
>>anonymity is higher than the number of people who are good actors,
>>your claim, in real life.

Amazingly enough, despite your lies, this is still holding to the idea
that roleplaying is acting.

I'm scared of losing your infantile mind, but I must do it. The next
one is not mine. You okay with that? You aren't lost? You can hold
onto this thought for more than two seconds? This one is from Koster.

He goes on to define those things. Considering all of them are valid
definitions of roleplaying, then roleplaying includes all of them.
Your shrivelled idiot intellect never managed to clue into that part.

Get it? Role-acting was not my definition of acting, you dumbass, it
was Koster's.

Role-acting was Kosters term.

Koster was the one who defined Role-acting in the narrow form of
roleplaying.

Have I repeated it enough for you? I find repeating things handy in
dealing with idiots like yourself. Perhaps you'll remember it.

Back to my quotes. MINE. Not yours, not Kosters, mine. As in,
attributed to me. You okay? Not lost or anything?

>>I said that was a

>>they weren't in real life is acting.

Holy fuck! It's still the same! All references after this were
responses to your lies that my definition changed.

You lose. Again. Next time try not to base your argument on a lie.
You'll do better. Dumbass.

*waits for Taras to humiliate himself yet again*
