  Yep.  Read one online (for free).  Gives detailed directions on
making a high CHA enchanter High elf, and getting baking skills 
up to 135 in Freeport.  Then making fish fillets for profit.  A 
better profit margin can be had by going to Thuragdin and making
smoked shark.
   Yes, it is mind numbing.  I can be useful for getting some cash,
but one would go insane trying to make several k's that way.  It
would be okay for minor twinking, or funding other trade skills,
but not for getting high-end equipment.  Unless one was extremely
patient, I suppose.

Annie  <--- likes unlimit plat, but really doesn't have the
            attention- span for it.
