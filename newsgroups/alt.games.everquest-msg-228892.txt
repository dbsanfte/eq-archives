Upon dinging 60, we get a 50% slow and a 40% haste. The latter only lasts 11
minutes and being a group's slower/haster really requires having a KEI on
plus our own kittycrack....but with that qualifier I have found to my
pleasant surprise that my LDoN and planes popularity went up a distinct
notch. Groups that haven't found a shammy or chanter are delighted to settle
for BST slow/haste with 80% of BST dps as part of the deal. (not full dps
cause I am spending some melee time being the slower).

I used Savagery for the first time the other day against a LDoN assassinate
target mob. Didn't end up really feeling like it was worth the peridot cost,
actually. Gotta try casting it on a rogue and see what they think.

Heh. True dat! And we haven't even discussed how perfect the particular BST
combination of capabilities is for soloing, which makes the first 45 levels
or so just fly by if you want them to. And the plat....soloing in Dulak in
the low 50s for exp and loot was so easy it almost made me feel guilty.

And I just heard that the new melee disciplines apply to hybirds, too!
Meaning beastlord DPS will improve further?? Heh. I'm still waiting for the
class-nerf bat to swing around at us, frankly.
