Backup healers?
The best healing shamans have is Cholorblast.  They can't use Torpor
because of the slow down effect on any meleer.  And casters aren't
going to be healed by a "backup healer".  

On big mob raids, if a caster wins aggro, the caster better have DA/DB
or the caster is dead.

Against big mobs, even riposte damage can completely overwhelm
Cholorblast.  And of course, if you honestly think a shaman can heal
someone when even a gimp mob like Zlandicar decides to rampage (and he
rampages a LOT), you're seriously mistaken.

Yep, they don't like the game anymore because Verant made sure their
role is meaningless.

Pick two god classes pre-Kunark and you would come up with shaman and
enchanter.  Post-velious, you couldn't find two more gimped classes as
those two.
