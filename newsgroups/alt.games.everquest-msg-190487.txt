    Not enough real estate in PoP, or in the entire rest of the game? In
PoP, I agree. Bad design there. But the rest of the game? I enter Fungus
Grove these days and nobody is there. Nobody. That one zone alone can
support a significant number of soloists and small groups in the lower high
level range. And the "six times" figure is off, as soloists almost never
outkill full groups.
