Ha!  I've played for about a year and a half with the music turned down the
whole time.  The only music I've heard is 1) the intro music, 2) the combat
music, 3) the ship and swimming music, and 4) the merchant music.

Went online after reading this thread, found the music volume control, and
turned it up.   Now I'm hearing tunes I never knew were in the game.... I
particularly like the martial music at the Grounds of Fate, and the peaceful
music at the Temple of Life.  Creates a whole new atmosphere in the game.

Dang it folks... now I'm going to have to repeat my world tours of Norrath
just to hear each city's 'national anthems'.....

Problem is now... the background mood music is fine, but the intro and
combat music just about blasts my ears off.....now I remember why I
immediately turned it down when I logged in with my very first character.
