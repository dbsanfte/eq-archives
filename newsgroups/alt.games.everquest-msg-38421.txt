That would be great!  I would make that requirement (although just barely).
However, I would like to point out that there are some good RPers who
have -just- started playing....  Likewise, there are lots of  l337 d00dz out
there (who really annoy me), who'll more than make that requirement..  Too
bad there's not an RP test or something like that..
