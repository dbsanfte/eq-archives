The good groups will be able to tell, trust me.  When they finish off one
mob, then turn around to see three others standing there drooling, it's
pretty obvious.

You'll need to educate the groups.  Once they get it, and understand just
how much easier it is when you turn a 6 on 3 fight into three 6 on 1 fights,
this will stop.  Or not.  It's a self-correcting problem.  Sometime in the
next 10 levels, most people will start being a bit more disciplined in
groups.  If they aren't, they'll start having a hard time getting groups to
begin with.

Here's a suggestion.  Make a "Mez" hotkey that says something like:
  /g Mezzing %T
  /cast 4 (assuming mez is in the 4th spell gem).

Then use it to let people know what you're up to.
