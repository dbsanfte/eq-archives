hey keav, i certainly heard a 'next 3 that join can be officers' in
g-fay on rathe server about a year ago-also heard some kid yelling to
join his new guild cause it had the 'coolest' name --when i shouted
what were its codes, beliefs and goals-he put out a question mark to
the zone-hehheh (he was still yelling for folks to join the next day
