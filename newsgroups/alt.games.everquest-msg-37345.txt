You have on quite a few occasions come after me for something while
totally ignoring another person on the opposing side in the same
thread guilty of the EXACT same thing.

I never said there was a difference. As a matter of fact, I have
outright said there _wasn't_ a difference. I don't "sell" rides with
my druid. I accept tips - unless it's obvious the passanger is

don't even ask for it unless they bring it up.
