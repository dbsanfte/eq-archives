Making it easier to get around will mean that the population can spread out
among the zones a little better instead of everyone cramming into the
easiest  zones to get to and from.  Anyone who doesn't have a Druid or
Wizard friend stays pretty close to home because the corpse runs are hell.
Sometimes when I log on I only have an hour or so to play.  I don't want to
spend half of that time running to a location to hunt.  It's the one thing
about PoP that I am excited about.
