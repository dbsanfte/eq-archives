adding one thing to that - a stun macro makes life easier

put your 3 stuns in (for example) slots 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

then make a social that says
/cast 1
/cast 2
/cast 3

The first time you hit it the lowest level stun casts,
the other 2 don't because you're already casting.

The second time, if the first stun is still greyed,
the second lowest stun casts.

With a macro like this you're always guaranteed to
use the lowest level stun available.
