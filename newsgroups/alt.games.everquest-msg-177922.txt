It's got a 400W supply at the moment. That *really* ought to be enough. :)

I have it almost certainly pinned down to a heat problem, as it 
demonstrably stays up longer when dead cold, and stayed up the longest 
after I took the heatsink apart and drowned the processor on thermal 
goop. 

I'll try buying a bigger cooling system this weekend. If that doesn't 
help, well... I guess I'll just have to write it off, bite the bullet 
and buy myself a professionally put-together system, a Dell or somesuch. 
bah.
