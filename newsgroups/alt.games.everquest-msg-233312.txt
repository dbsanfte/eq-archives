   I like to read the Firiona Vie community message boards.  Lately, it seems
that there have been a fairly largish number of posts trashing clerics.  Some
are about specific players, and I should imagine they are lodged with good
reason.  The others are more general.  It seems there is a portion of the
community that feels that clerics tend to be greedy, pissy, whiny, and bossy. 
And of course, that describes me perfectly.  But I am unaccustomed to hearing
people say it out loud to my face.

    I understand that reading a community rant board hardly qualifies as an
objective opinion poll.  It could very well be that a small but vocal group is
expressing a skewed view that very few of the rest of the population holds.  Or,
it could be that they are tapping into a real well of resentment that is growing
in the community.  There are several non-clerics that are defending us, I should
point out.  But I have to wonder if this is a growing trend or not.

   For the most part, the complaints are about us asking and or demanding 'dots
for buffage, not jumping high and fast enough whenever someone shouts "Need a
rez!" in the PoK, and for requiring a "donation" for selling Temp/Virtue/Aego in
the PoK.  Also, there seems to be a feeling that we feel we are the god's gifts
to Norrath (which in fact we are!) and that we expect everyone to kneel down and
kiss the ground we walk on (sounds reasonable to me!).

   So, what do you all think?  Is Firiona Vie the only one that hates her
clerics?  Is this just a temporary outbreak of insanity?  Or is this going
across all the other servers as well?
