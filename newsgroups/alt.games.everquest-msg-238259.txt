Whoa.  Why would I program it to disagree if I wanted it to agree?  I must 
-not- have free will after all.

Th question, though, is if we were created by a god-type being, aren't our 
lives then just a trivial reflection of *his* desires and therefore 
meaningless?

For the record, Im in the "free will is probably an illusion but who 
really cares?" camp, and the "existence or non-existence of god is 
irrelevant to the question of the existence or non-existence of free will, 
real or illusory" camp.  In my mind, all 8 combos of those variables are 
equally possible.  Although some of them are stupid.  But I wouldn't put 
it past the universe to be fundamentally stupid and illogical.
