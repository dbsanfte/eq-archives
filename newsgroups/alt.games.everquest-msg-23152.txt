Well, Befallen was taken over by dark elves a while ago, 
then the elves left for a few weeks, then very recently they returned. 
I was leveling up a cleric there in the interlude between dark elf takeovers, 
came back to finish off a level and found dark elves and had to leave (at level
9). Have no idea what it's like today.
