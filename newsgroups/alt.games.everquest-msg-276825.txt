Running around in west commons blind as a bat, playing a human paladin. Orc
groups were fun but even back in kunark era, which is when i started, you'd
get twinks trying to grab the entire camp for themselves.

1) Playing in the field of bone and falling below the world, and watching
red mobs tumbling down, and having no way out. Eventually i found you could
get out by going to the sea area, although there was a bug that sometimes
killed you with falling damage. I was very angry that they didn't fix that
bug and make it that falling below the surface ported you to a 'safe' area,
althought they did eventually.

2) camping some critter for 6 hours whilst some other guy tries to steal the
spawn, then losing connection because the link between australia and the
Verant server was unreliable, and coming back into the game to find he'd
gotten it and nearly quitting the game in frustration

3) enjoyable grouping in frontier mountains, earning my earrings.

4) becoming ally to the wood elf guards, this was later nerfed to warmly for
no apparent reason. I tried to get to ally with the halas warriors but the
psychopathic hatred they have towards wolf form made it impossible. The
hatred was never explained and didn't make sense. To me it was a kludge.

5) soloing the goblins in highkeep by training them to the guards and
mopping up the remains, and if things went wrong, running like mad to that
high level mage there who liked to beat things up with his fists.

6) swimming the pool in cabilis... really gave me a feel of being in a
ancient, decadent civilisation.

Yes, it was a bit of a surprise that dark elves seemed more loved, despite
the fact that iksar nastiness was a long time ago, and dark elves were
slaughtering people wholesale at the time a short distance from freeport.
Even Boombah the cannibal ogre could get a job in freeport easier than an
iksar.

I haven't played eq1 in years, so forgive my poor memory but what factions
are you trying to improve? If it's dwarf, that's the easiest in the game, i
used to love crushbone. Used to love grouping with my druid , i'd get aggro
on as much as possible, pull to druid, druid earthquakes, faction messages
scroll off screen... i didn't mind trashing my dark elf faction.
