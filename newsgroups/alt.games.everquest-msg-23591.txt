If I could pick your brains for a minute I am sure that someone else has had
this same problem.  I have a level 8 Cleric Dwarf that cant seem to hit
anything!  my accuracy is about one out of ten successful hit.  I have
pumped almost all of skill points into 1HBlunt but still it doesnt seem to
improve.  I am using a standard warhammer.

Any help will do....
