All due respect, but neither of those points is really a good enough reason 
not to implement that type of system.

a) CoH is already proving itself to be much better off in the area of class 
balance than others before it that had such trouble getting it right.

b) You can use your abilities as a defining point for your character to the 
fullest extent you may desire. That is no different either way.

I still say that it's flexibility made it one of the best skills 
implementations I've seen.
