There is no ring of station, only the earring of station.
Sarnaks don't drop any ring of any value that I know of.

Agreed.

The 10k price is bullshit in general. However, I did see several auctions
like this when Kunark first opened and all the 'new' loot was in demand.
That's probably where the 10k heresay comes from, but not now.

I'd pay 1-2k to loot it for my monk, no problem. But I aint going to sit
in LOIO for hours and hours auctioning it.
