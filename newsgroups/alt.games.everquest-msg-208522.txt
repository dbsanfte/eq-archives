Yes.  I don't know who finally woke Sleeper on Lanys.  Actually, I
don't even know _if_, as I abandoned my characters there not too
long after the Conquest fiasco.  But, given the prevalence of d00d-
like attitudes and behavior I saw there, I can't see any guild on
Lanys capable of it resisting the temptation to deny "easy" access
to primal weapons to their competitors.  I doubt that Conquest's
successor guild (nearly all the same people, don't know if leader
kept playing a different toon or not) would've done it, they were
not a large guild, depending on clever tactics to get their tough
kills.  They had a rep as a collection of arrogant punks, doing
stupid shit like crashing other folks raids and KSing with wild
abandon in order to get gear for some guildie's alt/bot.  They had
no respect for other players or for the game's rules/policies.  If
it worked they did it, it was really just a matter of time until
they got nailed to the wall for something.
