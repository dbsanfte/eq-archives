I am baffled by exactly what you described, people came from nowhere
to completely flood zones that had previously been empty.  Why is the
announcement of 2x XP enough to do that?  Why would that make you want
to play more than if it's 1x?  I mean, if you want to play why would
this make such a huge difference?
I spent 1 hour of play for the equivalent of 2 hours of XP.  While
nice, not a OMFG event.
