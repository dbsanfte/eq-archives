True, kind of.  There's a large bonus for killing mobs within 5 levels of
yourself.  Some say that the ZEM (the zone experience modifier) doesn't
benefit you if the mob is more than 5 levels below you, some say there's a
different bonus for things within 5 levels.  It doesn't matter which is true,
just realize that you get far more xp for killing something 5 levels below you
than 6.

So a lot of mobs give more xp at 65 than they do at 70.  If you're killing
L65+ mobs, you'll get AAs at the same rate (unless you kill them faster at 70,
in which case you'll get xp faster).  If you're killing L63 mobs, you'll see
a large drop in xp per mob when you hit 69.

Depends on what you're killing.  This is about right in a lot of PoP zones,
where your targets are 62-64.  PoFire tables have mostly L65 targets and
should be unaffected, along with WoS, KT, and MPG.

The cutoff level is dependent on target - things more than 5 levels below
you are worth far less than they were.
