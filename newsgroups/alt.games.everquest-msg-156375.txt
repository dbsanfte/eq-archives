Like martin said, go all out offensive, I'd say don't even worry about
keeping agro on the MA, his melee is insignificant compared the the AE,
anyone but the sissy robe wearers should be able to take some hits, but the
AE will eat them alive.

Warriors all go charge or fellstrike (high initial burst dps) except for
your MA who can go defensive, which will also help him live once he gets
shroomed.
Shaman and clerics should try to keep the AE cured off the wizards and some
tanks (and a cleric to rez the dead)
Druid's should nuke and help cure AE
Even post nerf a manaburn will help a lot.
Int casters should all go all out nuking after around 95% (wait a little bit
so they don't get eaten with near full mana)

I believe that the bard trak has less hp than the real trak, though I can't
say for sure as I've never done the real trak.

With around 170 PR (post resist changes) I took 1 AE full, 1 AE resisted,
and 1 AE did like 600 damage.  I was one of about 7 people out of 40ish that
was left alive, and managed to get people cured before they died (well,
except the dumbass that agro'd tolapumj and his juggs, though at least he
didn't train the raid, he ran them over to the opposite corner of trak's
room and died.
