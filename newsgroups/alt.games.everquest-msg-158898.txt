*shrug* Your post read, at the time and in context, as yet another
complaint added to a list of complaints.  I was reading and posting
in "flame the whiners" mode, so I just stuck with it.  And for that
matter, my post was rather mild, especially compared to the way I
expressed my opinion re: Druids bitching about PoK ports.

Depending on context, yes that is how your "innocent" observation
could be understood.

You posted into a thread with a subject line that includes the
highly pejorative term "nerf".  Your post was in support of the
complaint being aired there.  Your post was the most recent in
that vein at the time I composed my reply.  If you want to have
more control over how your words are interpreted, either include
a specific caveat or place them in a context that supports the
way you wish them to be taken.  You chose the context in which
your words were read by me, it is the height of absurdity to
insist that I ignore that context when reading them.
