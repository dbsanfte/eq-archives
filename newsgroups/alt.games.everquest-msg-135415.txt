Maybe in America. Over here it is generally taken to mean "I do not
have the patience to discuss this fully - you are *way* too obtuse".

Am I going to admit that this country is a totalitarian state? No! Of
course not - because it isn't. It is increadibly frustrating to have
a political conversation with a nation who seems to consider everything
non-capitalist/free market to be inherently evil. 'America the Great' 
talks about the 'London government' like they are some seperate breed
of people, who keep us under the thumb and oppress us - in reality, I
think you will find our government's behave almost identically. You
guy's can't buy a beer till you're 21 - is that opression? No, it's
just how you do it, and the same can be said for many things. Diff'rent
Strokes and all that.

Freedom from having to play a part in your own world is all that 
concerns you - you need to wake up. You can deny all you want, but
the rest of the world sees it - hell, that's why everybody hates you.

And before you start throwing accusations of jealousy - if I wanted
to live in America, I would. I could have a nice house, good health
insurance and a .44 under my bed to ward off LIEberals. I would,
however, have to learn to go without sleep.
