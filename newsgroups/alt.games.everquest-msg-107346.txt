There is a running relay quest. I don't know where it starts (it may
be circular), but I got involved at the Western most Guard Tower in
Western Plains of Katana. There was an NPC (can't remember name) who
invited me to participate in a relay race. I agreed and was given a no
drop torch which I had to take to Faijo Knejo in Misty Thicket
(located by the hole in the wall).  After handing over the torch to
Knejo I gained experience (I can't recall if there were any faction
adjustments, I don't think so), and was given a torch of Ro to deliver
to Andal Filla. I might have it wrong, but I'm thought Knejo told me
Northern Ro (not Southern). I almost got killed in Northern Ro by some
big fat nasty thing so I gated back to Everfrost.

I'm playing a level 10 Shaman who has just died somewhere at the
bottom of BlackBurrow. I think it may be a while before I get back to
Ro. Thanks for the pointer though.
