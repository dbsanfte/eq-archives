Ah cool, a TWC employee here...lemme ask you a question (well, anyone, but I
kept forgetting to ask until I saw this post).

The guy who installed my cable and cable modem told me that the signal was
too weak for me to split it in my computer room so I could set up a TV there
and watch TV while I med. :p  What do I need to do to get that signal strong
enough?  I imagine some sort of signal booster, but don't know what to buy.

I saw Motorola has probably what I need, but it didn't seem to require a
power source...and I can't get it through my head how you could possibly
boost a signal without an electrical source.

Thanks :)
