Bullshit.  Aside from your faulty logic (10% would have to hire blacks
FIRST to make enough "spaces"), just which 10% of the people hiring are
you speaking of?  It's not equal access unless the jobs have equivalent
pay, risk, intangible rewards (job satisfaction, etc.), prerequisites,
social status, and availability.  To achieve that is gonna take a
percentage much closer to 100% than to 10%, the job market isn't some
tepid homogenous thing where everything is the same as its neighbor.

No doubt 80% pay lip service to equal opportunity.  That doesn't equate
to actual opportunities.  AA quotas (which I also find stupid and self
defeating) were used in cases where long-standing racial discrimination
was demonstrated.  These employers were looking at race before any other
consideration of their own accord.  The idea was that the government was
ordering them to fix it.  The implementation was fucked up to a fare-
thee-well.  But that doesn't make it wrong to kick those evil fuckers in
the ass and demand that they get their shit straight, it just means that
the government did a bad job of it.

I guess I'm not surprised that you also believe there is no racial
discrimination vs. Asians anymore, why be so wrong about only one
thing when there's another so similar just waiting for you.  The
reason so many Asians have done so well here is that we did not
destroy their families and the pieces of their culture that they
chose to retain (despite some policies obviously intended to do so)
the way many slaveholders worked so hard to destroy black families
and the remains of African cultural ties among them, and so many
state governments and missionaries tried to destroy American Indian
families and culture (with almost as much success).  This gave the
Asians a much stronger "base" to build on, as with the Irish and
Italians and Jews, to pick some who obviously have thrived as
Americans.  But back to the Asian thing, Americans have a real
tendency to respect wealth, and so successful Americans of Asian
descent don't do too badly.  But more recent immigrants, Hmong in
particular, many of whom were simple farmers as opposed to university
educated city-dwellers, are treated just as badly as poor blacks in
the area I live, and that is definitely worse treatment than poor
whites receive.  And it's a helluva lot tougher to get up when you're
being kicked on a regular basis.  No, I'm not poor, nor am I a
racial minority, but I do live in a "transitional" neighborhood
with lots of poorer folk as neighbors.  Yes, the hard workers
eventually better their lot.  But the blacks and the Hmong are
mostly swimming through rougher water than the whites, they have
to work harder and wait longer and endure far more abuse, which
discourages many of them and is, simply, wrong.  Racism is very
much alive and working its evil in the U.S.
