I'd say get yourself Ruins of Kunark as you'll probably want
to head to the lake of ill omen around level 14 or so, and
get SOL. There's a few low level zones there plus the bazzar.
Vellious you don't really need until after level 30 and PoP as far
as I know is for pretty high levels...but I'm only guessing about
that since I don't have it yet.

Cheers
