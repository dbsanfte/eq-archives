    Presently, clock for clock, AMD and even P3 cpu's will outperform the P4
running everquest. Code must be optimized for the P4 to run it efficiently.
If Everquest if fully optimized for the P4, I would expect even the modestly
clocked P4 chips to outperform top of the line P3 and even AMD processors.
If you are planning on upgrading to tide you over for just a year or so, a
mid-level AMD would be the cheap way to go. If you are planning on upgrading
for a 2 or even 3 year run, and everquest is your main application, I would
seriously consider a 478 socket P4 with one of the new DDR boards. Most
important, is a decent GeForce 3 card, regardless of your choice of cpu. Do
your research and best of luck to you.
