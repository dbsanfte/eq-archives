  I'm not sure of piercers, but I do believe split paw hide masks act as a
light source.  And from what I've been seeing, there isn't a lot of good
face protection available for melee classes until you get up into the higher
levels.  You sacrifice a little AC vs. banded or a cougarskin mask or
whatever else you might be using (and I know rogues have some neat
illusionary masks), but it has SV Magic which is kind of nice, and like I
said, it's a light source (I'm not sure how good of one it is, though.)

  Hope this helps.
