    I've never enjoyed actually getting wiped out, and having my position on
the day worsened and time erased just to get back to where I was before the
wipeout. I have broken up laughing escaping wipeouts, though, and seeing the
screen freeze as I zone with more mobs than I can count on it. Then again, I
also know I personally don't enjoy PvP.

    Hint: no, you don't. I can give you a list of goals I have for every
character I play in EQ. If I die, I can show you exactly how much time I've
lost in achieving those goals. The same holds true in DAoC: if you want to
visit outpost X, and you get ganked, you can see exactly how much time you
lost in achieving your goal.

    It's strongly related to how much you enjoy the journey versus how much
you enjoy the end results, I imagine. I'm a goal-oriented person, so usually
it's the result that brings me joy. Sometimes the journey is fun - there's
places I just like wandering through when I'm heading somewhere specific,
for example. But for me, it's the end results - seeing that new pet spell
get scribed in the book, or nailing that double backstab for the first
time - that bring the most joy.
