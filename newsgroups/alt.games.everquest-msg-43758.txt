Opinions, fine.  Incorrect facts, bad. As I made clear.

Hyperblole- exaggeration for effect  Is that not what you did?  Stating "no
animations" and even that there are "No motion graphics showing your
warriors weapon swinging or the mob flinching, or anything" when there in
fact are such animations.  If your true point was that they were not
immersive animations, then yes, you were engaging in hyperbole.  Thanks for
playing.

Of course not.  You'd never waste your time making a case against something
like that, you're far too busy. *cough*. (long post debating whether poster
has right to opinion or not cut)

All I was asking was that you get your facts straight.  Sorry if that's too
big a challenge.
