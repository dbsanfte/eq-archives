I think you're doing something wrong. =P

All of the original "newbie" and "lowbie" zones are still out there and
I would imagine quite viable for you. For a 16 ranger, Lake of Ill Omen
is good experience, easy to find groups and decent loot. If you want to
stray from the beaten path (and I would if I were you), you could also
hunt in South Ro, North or East Karana, Lake Rathe, Lavastorm, Swamp of
No Hope, Shadeweavers Thicket, Hollowshade Moor, Palaudal Caverns,
Unrest. . . As for your 30 warrior, Frontier Mtns. and Overthere (if you
want to go where the crowds are) or South Karana, Rathe Mts., Crystal
Caverns, Paw, SolA or Perma (good exp and loot, but not so many people
there now ~ you might need to bring your own group.) Don't worry about
not having much money; no one does with a non-twink for quite a while. I
didn't start to make decent cash until I was mid-30s or 40, I think
