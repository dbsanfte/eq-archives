Only so long as that person does not know that this is the case.

What is the need for an object lesson when God could create you to not do 
whatever it is he wants you not to do to begin with?

Again, how can you be pissed at somebody's ancestors when you are the one 
who created them to do exactly what it is they did?

Again, the only time an object lesson would serve any use would be if the 
person being taught really did have free will, and really could choose 
either way.  If God could create everyone to do exactly what it is he 
wants them to do, there would never be a need for object lessons, and in 
fact, it strikes me as vindictive and mean to even create such object 
lessons purposely.
