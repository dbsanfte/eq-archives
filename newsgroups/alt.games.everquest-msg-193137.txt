I just spent this last weekend building a computer for my wife.  I'm
jealous.  I have an 1.5GHz P4 with a GeForce 3.  I built her a 2.53GHz P4
with a GeForce4.  I still have more memory (768MB), as I only put 512MB in
hers.  I also have the 21" monitor to her 17" and mine has the DVD RW.
Still, that 2.53 is really fast.

Cheers,
Eric
