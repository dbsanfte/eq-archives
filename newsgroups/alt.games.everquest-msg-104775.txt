Recently I picked up a gnoll hide lariat... As a rogue I've read that these
are fairly useful to have as it can stun a mob.  Sure enough, the weapon
effect is 'stun'.  I put this in my off hand, and it sure hits a lot but
I've yet to see it proc.  I'm not getting any messages like 'you do not have
the will to command this weapon' (the guy is now lvl 27).... does this thing
just plain and simply not proc often or suck that much?  My dex is now
pushing 120 or so..
