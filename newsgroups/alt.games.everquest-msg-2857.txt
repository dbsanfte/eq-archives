So you are sending him the message its ok to be an asshole because
you let him have an asshole name. Right, good thinking.

Ok so a group of assholes get together and report everyone they
don't like and want to piss off. Yeah that's just what I want to sit
in some 'jail' for half an hour because I looked the wrong way at

Gee sounds like fun, sign me up. NOT!

LOL! What system?

PK systems suck. Always will.

You will NEVER solve the problem of having no-life morons
that are on all the time and know the systems and its flaws
inside and out that will jump the newbies and ruin it for them.
I have seen it time and time again.
