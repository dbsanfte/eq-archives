Its not a 'nice' cleric item, its one of the most vital in the game to
a cleric. A cleric without epic is half a cleric at best. There isn't
a day that goes by you wouldn't end up using it.

Cleric epic start to finish usually takes 2 weeks, usually less with
strong guild support.

>FWIW, we already have clerics in my guild that have their epic.

Yeah.. .but i'll wager those who don't have have a) allready done part
of their epic and b) usually just need one or two things to finish..
usually scroll from king or shards from skyfire. Most clerics i run
into are like this... and guilds usually have no problem running a
quick king or ragefire drive-by in offtime to help out the cleric.

>So here's my question:  Is this really such a big deal to a guild?

Yes. Its an infinite amount of 96% mana free rezzes. Your guild
wipes... oh look there is Healea in the corner OOM waiting for more
mana while the more able clerics rezz away with their epic. Your group
wipes, oh look.. there is Healea medding every second rezz and taking
10 minutes to do what a normal cleric with epic does in one. And when
you have to rezz 50 dead people from a wipe... trust me, no-epic
clerics just don't cut the mustard.

>Do *uber* guilds have a requirement that clerics have their epic?  Is refusal
>to complete Epic a firing offense?

If an app cleric didn't have epic... or the willingness or
understanding of why it is done, I would have serious doubts on their
ability to even heal in a raid level situation.
