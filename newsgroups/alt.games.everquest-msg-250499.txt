Dude I don't know which version of the game your playing.. but
In the PC version of EQ you automatically switch weapons out when you switch
from melee to ranged attack.
Hell on the right mob you can actually melee and sneak off a couple arrows
(some dragons and wyrms are like this)
You do need to turn off autoattack to use ranged attacks instead of melee
but you also have to be outside of melee range in most cases anyway. Which
means your gonna be turning off your autoattack to get rid of all the spam
anyway.
Further Ranged Attack does not have an autoattack function so unless you set
up a gamepad or some other macroing device you'll stop firing when ever you
stop spamming the button anyway.
Generally unless you are a ranger the only time you'll use a bow is for
pulling so you'll fire off a couple shots while its inc and when the mob
gets into range hit autoattack to melee it.
If your a ranger you'll have at least 60 levels under your belt before
archery becomes a viable main form of combat so I'm not gonna sweat that for
now.

As to your question about hitting mobs from places they can't reach you..
well sony considers that an exploit and has given all mobs the ability to
teleport up and womp yer ass if you try it.
