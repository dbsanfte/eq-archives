    Yes. I know of at least one cleric on my server that was not only
E-Bay'ed with epic, but he also has the no-longer-dropping GHeal stick from
Veeshan's Peak (right-clickable Greater Healing, with not too long a casting
time). The guild that bought him uses him as a bot cleric, and he's perfect
for that - every so often adjust who you're targetting, hit the GH stick
hotkey, go back to your real character.
