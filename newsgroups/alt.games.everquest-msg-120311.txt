Prexus seems kindof far behind other servers, in terms of "uber guilds"...

Tunare was killed only 2ish months ago for the first time (about a month
before we killed her) - killed by 3 guilds total now.

The AoW was only first killed about 1 and a half month ago, now killed by 3
guilds total (2 different guilds within a week of each other)

It seems they only raise your level to match or better the competition,
rather then to better themselves...

e.g, a fairly small guild (never cleared nToV, tunare, ST etc) started to
work on the AoW,  they pretty much shocked the "uber guilds" into action,
when a guild of no primals, no ntov loot, got the AoW to 30ish percent...
that beat any previous AoW attempts.

Within a week, the server "uber guild" (who had tried, failed, and moved on
from the AoW) had killed the AoW for a server first (I heard it was a bit of
a zerg but can't really comment as I didn't see it)... if that smaller guild
hadn't gotten the AoW so low though, the #1 guild wouldn't have pulled out
all the stops to kill it.

Our main guilds seem to pharm a lot more than other server uber guilds (does
your servers top 1 and 2 still kill Tormax, Yeli and nToV fairly frequently?
From what I've seen, other server guilds moved onto newer things and don't
even bother with most Velious stuff.. so unlike Prexus heh)

The emporer and shei are still unkilled on Prexus

hehe ya, we've killed a LOT of dains lately (another 4 dains on Monday).. as
well as the guild peoples shawls, various un-guilded and smaller guild
people turned their shawls in for us, for a piece of the Dain loot (not
including his head)
