Hehe, cant agree more on that one. If someone ask me for a SLN now, its more mana 

efficient for me to invite him and both skin him, and renew my own at 
the same time.
In raid times its invaluable if you dont have a cleric in the group. Was 
on a Kael raid yesterday, gtouped with 3 wizzys, 1 shammy and me, 
invaluable there, make the wizzies able to takea  few extra hits when 
summoned.
