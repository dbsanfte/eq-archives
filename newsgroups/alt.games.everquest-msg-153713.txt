Isn't there a cycle time on MB, so you can't have a team nuke
something dead, then port to mob  two and nuke IT dead as
well.. instead you can pick any single target, kill it, and then
go about your business for a couple hours till next time.

Further, I thought most interesting mobs were now under random
time, so that you can't time lock them down except to within
a few hours plus/minus.

Perhaps I'm misinformed, though, my wizard information almost
all comes out of one woefully underinformed 60 wizard acquaintance.
