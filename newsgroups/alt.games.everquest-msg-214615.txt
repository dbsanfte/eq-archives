That LoY quest  neck piece is not Paladin useable, also, both have
21% haste (same as FBSS).  The quest requires a rare drop off of a
common mob in the tunnels in Dulak.  A solid group of low 40s (both
Cleric and Warrior highly recommended unless group is hi 40s) could
camp Soulstealer (very nice droppable CLR/DRU/SHM 1hb) and hope to
get a cloak (the quest bit for the Dark Cord) or two.
