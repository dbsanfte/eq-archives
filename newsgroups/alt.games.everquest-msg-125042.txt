We created a Guild a few weeks back, and despite being told differently by
two Guides, we DID need to have 10 accounts present in game and in the same
zone when the Guild was created. Technically they need to be there for a
Guide to count prior to the Lead GM attending, but unless you are unlucky
the two events should be quite close together.

Our members WANTED to be present, which made things easier :)
