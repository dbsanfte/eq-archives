...Wow.  :)

I'm curious.  I know that wood elves start with the forage skill; what level 
is it and how much better/more effective is a druid's maxed forage skill?  
I've played only 1 druid (and a halfling, too -- I feel so dirty) but plenty 
of Iksar, who have a racial forage of 50 and can still sometimes forage 
"special" items (IIRC).

As soon as you said "forage" I thought "iksar" rather than "driud".  Heh.
