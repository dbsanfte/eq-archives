This is one thing I think would be nice. I'm not saying you make it where
all mobs drop it or anything, just that banks are able to exchange it into.
Call it... Iridium coins for lack of a better current name.

This wouldn't hurt any current balance and would help out with high end
trading etc. I know monks would love this... but I came to this conclusion
with my druid. Sitting in WC, looking for uber gear with 2k plat on me and
I'm almost encumbered. And this is a DRUID. with 98STR no less! My base
weight is usually like 39/98. giving me almost 60 free weight... which is
all swallowed up in coinage.

Then I ported to DL to get in a group and looted one item and got "You are
ENCUMBERED" and I said DOH! what a waste... someone invent checks :)
