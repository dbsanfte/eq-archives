I've only ever had one blue screen in XP and that was because my hard drive
crashed which I would expect to generate one.  I've had one machine up and
running for 6 months without rebooting (until recently for SP1).  As far as
install problems, I've never had one although people I know have.  Most blue
screen problems I've seen others have have been with drivers, which kind of
sucks since some of those drivers were certified.  I've not usually seen
more current devices have this problem though, it's usually been 5 to 10
year old hardware.  Anyway I love XP and personally had loads of problems
with every other MS OS, including 2000.  It's all about personal experience
I guess.
