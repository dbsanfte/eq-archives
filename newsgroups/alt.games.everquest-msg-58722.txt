  I personally don't think it's rude, especially if you are addressing the
entire post, instead of individual aspects of it.  I think it's easier to
read if you quote the text of the person you're replying to, then post your
response... it's more like a normal conversation... question/answer,
statement/response, argument/rebuttal.  Top-posting does it backwards...
answer/question, response/statement, rebuttal/argument and it can be a
little confusing.

  However, if you're responding to the person's ENTIRE post rather than
addressing it point by point, question by question, I see the sense in
top-posting since (as you say) it saves people the trouble of scrolling
through duplicate text to get to the next text, while still making the old
text easily referenced.  Though is it really that much a hassle to have to
tap PageDown once? :P

  I personally have gotten in to the habit of "bottom posting" because I
think overall it makes more sense and is easier to read and comprehend, and
I just try not to quote blocks of text that are too terribly long (though am
guilty of doing that on occasion).
