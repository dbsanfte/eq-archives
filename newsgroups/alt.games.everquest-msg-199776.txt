I'm not sure how doable it is at 30 (I don't remember when I did it) but
there is a quest that results in a mystic cloak that's not bad...
I've seen Amulet's of Insight for less than 1k pp... Or Blackened Alloy
Medallions
If the stuff for it is selling cheap in the bazaar, look at the Beginner's
Magic Manual Quest(you can't get it otherwise, loot is planer drops).

I saw an inlade jade hoop for 250 once... they arn't bad (looted mine).
