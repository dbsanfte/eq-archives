I was still having a fair amount of success tanking mobs to death even as
a level 37 bard. I dinged 38 last night and am going to do some chant &
charm & swarm kiting for a few levels, just to try it out. I'm guessing
that beating up frost giants is just one of those things better done at a
distance. While you're almost always better off letting some other melee
or hybrid tank for you, you've still got quite a ways to go before you
have to give up tanking.

Conversely, you can start singing mobs to death (using only your instruments
and your bare hands) as early as level 12 if you want to bellow kite (really
boring) or 18 for dotting them to death. You should give these a try, at
least, just to get a feel for them.
