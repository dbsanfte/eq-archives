And that is my issue with the Cleric epic, among other camps.  It is totally
ludicrous to have a camp that you have to hold for that kind of a time
period.  I'm not saying make it easy to get epics, they are epic, and should
be very difficult to get.  I am just glad, that by the standard of most
other epics, the shaman epic is trivial to get.  The way they have it, it
just about requires that you share the cleric with the guild, at least for
the Ragefire portion of the epic.
