I'm using 4.7 as well, tried the bloatware they call 6.0 and scrubbed
it off my machine after a month.  As time goes on, though, I
find more and more sites I can't access fully.. I bet one in
twenty now are not compatible with this version!

Since no sane person is going to suggest using MS crapware,
if Netscape isn't the mainstream, what is?  I"ve considered
biting the bullet and switching, had Opera and Free Agent
both on my last machine for a while, but I don't really like
fiddling around with software all that much, and I kept
using Netscape instead cause its something I"m familiar with.
