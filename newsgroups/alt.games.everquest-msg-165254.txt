Hi, 

EQ has recently started to crash my machine, not just to the desktop,
but instant reboot!!

Appears to have started around the time I upgraded my graphics drivers
to the new Nvidia ones, version 40.72.  It is not frequent, but tends
to happen when loading EQ, where you select the character you are
going to play. It has happened mid game though.

Is it just me - or anyone else?

Machine specs are

Board = Asus A7A266 with latest BIOS
Winfast Gforce3 with Nvidia 40.72 drivers
SBLive5.1 latest creative drivers
512 Mb 2100 DDR mem
Ath  1.333Ghz
XP Pro - patched to latest 
Nothing obvoius/untoward running in background.

May be I will go back to the 30.82 drivers - but thought I would check
here first.

TIA for any help
Cheers
