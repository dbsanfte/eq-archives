Absolutely.  Of course, it'd almost certainly be too late, if you
see yourself at 5% you're probably already dead.  At least that's
been my experience the last few months with the ridiculous lag I've
seen for HP updates at all times and in all places and with every
variation on lag mitigation I can think of.  Nowadays, if my health
was dropping that fast (full to zero in less than 10 seconds), I'd
use LH no later than 20% health.
