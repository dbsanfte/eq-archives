I made BOTH left and right arrows the hot keys for Sense Heading.  This
works twice as well...hehe.  It can get a bit annoying so after you get to a
Sense Heading of about 50, only assign one of the arrows to that key.  It's
also great if you're trying to bring up that forage skill, but you have to
keep dropping berries or stuffing veggies into your pack.  Well worth the
trouble, imo.
