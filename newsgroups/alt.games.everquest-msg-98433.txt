The real VS is VASTLY more difficult than VSR. VSR only does the lifetap
punch once in a blue moon, VS does it quite often (although not as often as
he did initially, when he did it EVERY HIT). VS raids go one of two ways:
1) He dies with no fatalities, 2) Raid wipeout. If he kills anyone, that
means he has lifetapped himself up enough that everyone else is doomed.

Clerics are useless, enchanters are god. 55+ melees with riposte discipline
are the ONLY thing you should ever consider tanking him with. One of the
best ways to go is to have your main tank (assuming it is a barbarian or
fatty) duel down to berzerk status, and equip that 40/150 axe from the
forest giants in Frontier Mountains (name of axe totally escapes me at the
moment)...the delay is irrelevant when riposte is on, and the HUGE damage
(made all the bigger, since the 2H damage bonus is based on delay) combined
with crippling blows can make a mountain of difference.

VS has really gimpy hitpoints, like 16-18k or so. Needs lots of melee/fast
wizard nuking. Enchanters chain-rune the main tank to keep him from taking
any damage. While VS is more difficult than VSR, with velious-power weapons
(and rogue epics) being so much more easily available now than when kunark
first came out, he really isn't that difficult at all. The real trick is
actually getting to him...he is a VERY high competition spawn, because the
risk vs reward is so heavily into the player's favor (nevermind about 5
epics go through him in some form or another).
