Agreed.  We had a conversation in /ooc last night about this.  There were a
lot of people discussing the merits (or, rather, the lack of) people having
to learn a new class from scratch.  I was able to group with an enchanter
that mezzed himself 4 times because he had the wrong mezz spell memmed and a
cleric that did not know what the different heals (Cel vs Healing) were used
for and could not understand why they were aggroed after healing us.

I think that the /testbuff should have been limited to people that have
played either the same or similar calss to 25 and above.  That would have
limited a lot of the learning curve problems.
