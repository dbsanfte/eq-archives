Umm, level one Vicar is 51 cleric. Just so ya know. I do not solo, and
feel I cannot. I'm not a twink- I'm the main.

Thanks for the rest of the tips though.

IF I could, I'd have my horrid spots filled with the imbued dwarven
plate. The hard part is getting the effing lava rocks! My smithing is up
high enough to make them.

Thank you everyone else who participated. I'll consider well what you
have said, and perhaps browbeat my pet troll into hunting a few more
things for me.
