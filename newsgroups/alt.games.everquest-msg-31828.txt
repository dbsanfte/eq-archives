Yes and no.

I don't disagree that it *is* fiction-breaking. That sort of thing
should definitely be kept to the /ooc channel.

I do disagree regarding it being more fiction-breaking than the
moronic name, however. Especially since the person calling out "Camp
check" indicates, to me at least, that they respect the others in the
zone by finding out what is available.

Finally, of course, though courtesy encourages it, there are no rules
that prohibit shouting "camp check", so it really isn't a comparable
case.
