That's full of shit...I read the same post on Everlore yesterday.  If you
decide to go to the legends server...you DO get to keep your stuff.

"The service looks really neat. But is the moving of characters to this
service/server going to have the same limitations that character moves
currently has? I.e. no gear goes with you, and no moving between servers of
differing rulesets?

We'll be allowing any character from any server to move to a Legends server,
stuff included."

Maybe you should take a quick look for the info before stating something
stupid, asshole.
