Having reached the heady heights of 60 I appreciate all classes (except
Beastlord as have never grouped with one) and I know how to evolve tactics
in the group situation to meet what classes I have in my group. I would say
that no class is useless in a group situation. Necros are an excellent
versatile class and a valuable addition to any group.
