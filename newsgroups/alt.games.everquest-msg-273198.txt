I've just started EQ tonight.  Am in the tutorial.  I graduated and was
given a key.  I found myself in a room with some oddball monsters that I
gather I am to release.

My inventory shows me a key that Arabeth (?) gave me.  The door says I
need a special key to open it.

OK, how do I use this key?  I can't seem to equip it in the inventory
window.  Dragging it from the backpack to the door didn't work.  I've
clicked and dragged everything I can think of and the door remains
locked.

I am assuming this is not a 'bash' door since I was given a key.  What
is the trick to using the key?
