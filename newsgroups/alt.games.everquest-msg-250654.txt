I looked earlier today, I have a whopping 200 points in Takish ( and 800 
points overall)... this from doing LDoN almost exclusively from 30 to 
55, when the exp suddenly dropped into the toilet.  Strikes me that LDoN 
points as reward are fairly worthless for the low levels, due to the 
fact that before you've earned enough to buy a given spell or item, 
you're already so high level that its no longer competitive.  Points per 
mission ramp up so fast, though, that I'm reasonably sure I can get 
those 800 much faster now that I'm in my 60s, just have to stoop to the 
terrible exp for a few days.

Have that one, seems to work nicely, nuking for 1930 to 2370 and didn't 
get a single "blocked" shot off all night.  Levitate might be helping 
there, but I find it hard to believe its that perfect a workaround, I'm 
pretty sure I recall at least a few "oops" events back in my 40s.  This 
was shooting into a kite with pets on the mob, too, very very hard to 
believe I missed accidentally hitting something every single time.

> 1. Ward of Xegony (61 air pet)
Yep, have that, been using him.  Orb of Exploration very helpful, as he 
has the annoying habit (like all air pets) of going invis before I've 
even managed to hand him his weapons and muzzle kit.

> 2. Black Steel (63 nuke)
Don't have it, couple levels away anyway, something to watch for though.

> 3. Summon Sapphire Bracelet (unless you have an ID 4 item).
Have that.  Only thing going off with Firebolt of Tallon... all my other 
summons are 60-

Haven't got that yet, 61 also?  I miss the faster cast time thing as well.

Nope.  I've used these acquired from other mages in the past though, and 
they seem to have the exact same stats and proc as the 61 blade.  Is 
there a point to this, other than that the proc hits a different resist?

Haven't got it...nor do I remember ever seeing this in the bazaar "for 
5pp" circles

Sad, I remember when pet healing really worked ok.  1200 hp, when the 
mobs are hitting for 2000?

Nice upgrade to TPP, sounds like unobtanium though to me.

I enjoy soloing, but without a slow, it seems pretty unlikely at the 
high end of the game... or at least not very worthwhile, since zones 
where soloing is an option without slow seem to consist of old world 
ones with terrible ZEMs

Never did like rains, although the theoretical damage ratio is some of 
the best in the game, they seem to get far more resists than anything 
else I've ever cast.

Heh, yep, "yer a god in ONE ZONE IN THE GAME"... funny.  Makes my

solo seem silly indeed.

Good start even if you did... 5 months offline I've lost a lot of 
perspective on how things value out, and of course never did have the 
personal experience at this end of the mage game anyway.
