PoI mobs were immune to Harmony of Nature (Ranger/Druid equivalent of the
same line) from the get go.

Mobs can be flagged immune to these types of spells in the same way they
can be flagged as immune to slow(s) or changes in movement speed, simple as

immune before they were removed from the game completely and they were
green to most hunting them.
