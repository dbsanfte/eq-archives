If you're killing HGs for xp you're being foolish.  People hunt HGs
for the pp, many folk still hunt them when they're light blue or even
green.  When pulling for an HG group I happily forgo some fraction of
the xp in order to keep the loot flowing as fast as the group can
handle the mobs, and I'd replace a puller for such a group who did not
share that attitude.  There are many ways to get xp much faster than
killing HGs, if you want xp go do something else, if you want loot
then quit whining about the xp and get out there and do your job.

Depends on why the mob's rooted, but in the case at hand, a heavily
DoT'd mob that can be handled with no further melee intervention
then that's pretty obviously called for.
