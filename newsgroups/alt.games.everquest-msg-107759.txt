You can ask how after you get them out. It's not relevant to the
solution the player wants, which is to get out from under the world.
They are going to need summoning out no matter *how* they got under
there.

Alternatively, asking how they got under there would be a good way to
open the conversation. It's not important to the solution but it gives
the impression you read the petition.

That's an old trick that lets you work on the problem while they're
blathering on about stuff you already know; it's not limited to CS
either. But that's not how EQ CS people are supposed to behave.

CONGRESSMAN:  "These reports undoubtedly prove that your product makes
    people die. You are selling things which make people die, but not
    only do they just die, they also become addicted to your product
    for tens of years before they die, thereby supplying you with
    obscene amounts of money in exchange for letting them die."
TOBACCO REPRESENTATIVE: "Yeah, so?"
CONGRESSMAN: "Only us governmental officials are legally able to kill
    people and take their money."
