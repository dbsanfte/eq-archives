Communism lost?  You mean the Soviet Union lost.  Ever hear of China?  You
think China's just a kindergarten kid whose hands we can slap whenever we
feel like it?

You know, I really doubt Saudi Arabia *wants* Saddam to rule them.  The
question wasn't whether we should allow them to become part of Iraq if they
want to, but whether we should continue to protect them from Iraqi invasion.

Much of the "butting into other people's business" that you're complaining
about happened during the Cold War.  For example, we sent weapons to the
Middle East so they could defend themselves against Russia *during the Cold
War*.  Now you and others are saying we have no right to complain if those
weapons get used against us.  So, yes, the Cold War is over, but by your own
arguments, you can't protest about anything we did during the Cold War.  The
Cold War is over so shut up about it, huh?  Well, events during the Cold War
are still affecting us now.

Now you're spouting straight socialist conspiracy theory.  Sorry if I'm
offensive in saying that, but... "Switzerland operates banks so they can run
massive Mafias in key countries of the world and bring about Armageddon."
"The UK sent troops into WWII not to fight the Nazis but to plant false
evidence of concentration and death camps and get the Nazis accused of
genocide."  What would you say to statements like that?  We send billions
and billions of dollars worth of aid to poor third-world countries who have
virtually nothing we want.  And you claim that the only reason we send this
aid is so we can secretly get a stranglehold on their economies and rape
them of everything they have.  Even if this ridiculous statement were true,
and we raped them for every last bit of their production, we would still
show a loss because everything they could offer us is worth significantly
less than the value of the aid we send them.

(I take the above statement as an implication that there's a way we ought to
be doing it, something this wise man thinks is the "proper way" for us to be
acting)

So you're one of those, huh?  The ones who think that we owe you something?
I meet people like you, you know.  People who say, this is what you ought to
be doing, because that's what they would like to see happen, and are
astounded when we don't do *exactly* what they said because, well, it's what
we *ought* to be doing!  (In your wise opinion, that is)

Seriously, look at the world today.  There are people who hate us because we
butt into their business.  There are people who hate us because we didn't
help them (or a friend of theirs) when we could have.  There are people who
hate us because we're rich.  There are people who hate us because they're
poor.  There are people who hate us because we have military strength.
There are people who hate us because we keep WMDs from them.  There are
people who hate us because we *have* WMDs.  For every conceivable reason,
there's someone who hates us.  Why is this?  Because we're the Great Satan?
No.  It is because we are the most significant international power in the
world.  This means that no matter what we do, everyone in the world will
look at what we do and judge us for it.  The people who benefit by it will
smile and say America is a great country.  The people who do not will curse
us and call us the Great Satan.  There is no conceivable way we could please
everyone, or even most people.  I understand this.  I even accept this, and
agree that this is the way it will be (unpleasant but unavoidable).  Because
I and other Americans accept this, we do what is right in our own eyes.  We
are not going to *try* to please you because you'll be mad at us if we
don't, and *try* to please China because they'll be mad at us if we don't,
and *try* to please Saddam Hussein because he'll be mad at us if we don't,
etc., etc.  Yes, we pay attention to our global "approval rating" because we
need to avoid pissing people off *too* much if we're going to avoid global
war.  But we can and will do what seems most beneficial to the world in our
eyes.  If you disagree, feel free to do so, but don't presume to tell us
what to do because you think we owe it to you.  Don't criticize us by saying
we have "ulterior motives" or we're "brainwashed" or we're "imperalist
capitalist warmongers" or whatever the current catchphrase is.  You could at
least do us the courtesy of standing on your own two legs instead of
pointing to yourself laying on the ground and saying, "Look, I fell down
because America didn't reach out and hold me up!"

> >> I don't see you volunteering. Another chickenhawk?

When I finish college I'll very likely be in the army, unless of course
we're not at war then, in which case I'll do whatever and reserve my army
service for a time when I'm actually needed.
