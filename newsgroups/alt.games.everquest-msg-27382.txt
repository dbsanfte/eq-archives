1) Kill orcs by the many of thousands in EC, WC, WFP or Misty Thicket.
All positive faction hits.

2) See if you can do the Lottery Ticket quest at Hallard's Resales in
EFP (hand in 4 orc pawn picks). All positive faction hits. (Many
merchants in WFP, EC and WC have tons of the picks for sale).

3) If you aren't KoS in High Keep (which apparently you aren't as you've
done the goblin ears quest), kill Osargen in the prisoner area. Lvl 22
rogue, six minute spawn. This raises Knights of Truth but lowers Dismal
Rage and Opal Darkbriar faction. So it appears you'd have to give up
visiting the evils in FP if you do this quest. What I don't know is how
big his faction hit is.

4) You might try wolf form in NFP and see if you are not KoS. If not, go
to the Knights of Truth and kill the piranhas in the pond there. Same
faction hits as 3). DO NOT touch the minnows as the guards will protect
them. 

5) Check here for other possible options:
