Wow, nice run.  We've found recently that we've been in the leather room 
too much.  We're pulling to a different room now and getting more plate, 
but it may just be a run of luck.  Still not getting much though.

I've killed him with 18, and 3 of them were pick-ups at the zone line.  It 
was one of our first kills, and had more to do with stubborn determination 
than anything else.  I'm quite confident that he can be taken out with the 
right 12 people, but if you're farming him for BPs, you're probably not 
one of these twelve people.
