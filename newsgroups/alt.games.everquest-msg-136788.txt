Believe it. I do not suffer fools gladly, and I certainly won't stoop
to pamper someone idiotic enough to intentionally drop their in-game
valuables in a busy location.

As a tailor, I've had lots of occasions where someone purchases an
item from me to have it drop on the ground because they didn't have
room. That's an *accident*. In those cases, I pick it up before anyone
else can, and hold it while they clear a space.

That's an entirely different thing than coming across a pile of
goodies that someone *intentionally* dropped, knowing that it could be
picked up by anyone who wanders by, or even poofed by the server.
Someone who does that knows the risks involved, and accepts them.
