Ok i have to come clean. I've only ever done 1 quest in the game when i 
was around level 8 i think trying to collect some ice crystals in 
everfrost peaks and ended up dieing 3 times, the reward for the quest 
was a staff that was really useless and i couldnt sell it.
Another useless item i destroyed.
The frustration of the effort i put into that at level 8 only to get a 
level 4? item had put me off quests a bit but now i am interested in 
giving some a go.
People keep telling me about cool things i can get on quests such as 
staff of temeperate flux etc.
Can anyone tell me what quests they recommend a level 29 erudite wizard 
can do, either solo or grouped that are actually worth doing for the 
risk involved.
I will do the staff quest at some point and id like to do journeyman 
boots or similar.
Any others that are worth doing?
Also what level would i need to be to do the staff and journeymans 
quest?

thanks
