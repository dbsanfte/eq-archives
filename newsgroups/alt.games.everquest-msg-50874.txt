Is pretty easy to score a FS weapon in SK for a few pp's. If you want to buy
something more upmarket, then go to EC. I can think of any camps you can do
at 14 to give you a decent weapon.

Check out casters realm (orget the URL, do a web search). They have the
location of all spells there.

Bronze is probably it for now. When you get some more money and levels you
can start getting pieces of crafted armor.

Druids and wizards get ports. Self only at 19 and group at 29. (maybe wiz is
20, not sure). Wizard spells are called blah gate or blah portal, and the
druid spells are ring of blah(personal),circle of blah(group),wind of the
blah(group evac kunark), and sucor blah.(group evac)
