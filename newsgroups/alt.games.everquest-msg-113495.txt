Do you no longer have increased regeneration?  If you do then you are
seeing benefit.  You want a little extra benefit, something for the
effort,perhaps?

How many AA points have you spent in regen?

They both pay the same amount for it, so to me, at least, the concept
doesn't exactly epitomize the absense of sense :).  It makes some
sense.  Should heals double heal for regenerating races?  I could see
regenerating races being able to pay double aa points for double the
regen than normal.  That would make sense.

IMHO they are just leveling the playing field,  why should trolls and
iksar get double the benifit at the same cost?  You could argue that
because they have high natural regen.  Others could argue thats
exactly why they don't need it, akin to enchanters getting increased
mana regen AA than other classes. But either way AA regen skill is no
"gushing fountain of life" anyway.

I do agree with you it sucks to loose any ability no matter how
insignificant.  Thats why i propose we all beg druids for "Regrowth"
24/7 on the grounds that AA regen has been nerfed (whether you are
affected or not).
