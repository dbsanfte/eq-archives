The lineage stuff I'm not absolutely sure on... It's how I understand 
the model works. As far as declining subscriber base killing a game, 
games are usually ok as long as they stay above some threshold. I doubt 
we SoE serious discussion for shutting down EQ as long as it's above 
100k subscriptions. In fact, given the amount of work they've put into 
it, I can forsee a time when EQ becomes simply a value added service to 
their main line of top 1-2 games. Get yourself an all access pass with 
your EQ2 or PlanetSide 2 account and you can download the basic (say 
everything through LDoN) game and play it when you need a change of pace.

Well in FF, they have an 'auto translator' (phrasebook), but either the 
europeans have not found it yet or it only works Japanese<->English.
/shout {Teleport-Mea} {Do you have it?} {Can I have it} {Help me out} 500Gil
/shout {Teleport-Mea} {Teleport-Holla} {Do you need it?} 500Gil
Whereas I see a lot

then there are the idiots that think they are funny... shouting obscene 
phrases built with the phrase book, then wondering later on the boards 
why people are reporting them, and they are getting warned/banned.
