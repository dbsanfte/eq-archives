Download Acclerator does general HTTP packet cashing, but only "appears" to
respond to HTTP download packets.
So regardless of wether it appears "only" to be responding to download
packets it is still busy, happily caching away various packets of all types,
because at it's heart is a very simple packet sniffer.

Packet Sniffer + High Processor intensive game = Slow performance

Have fun and don't worry about the faq from places like download accelerator
they are mostly written by guys in marketing.  If you really want to see
what a program is doing, break out your favorite debugger, you will be
amazed.
