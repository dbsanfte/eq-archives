Yeaaahh, that works but until Win95 came out there was little (or none at
all?) use for Ctrl-Esc and Win95 KBs came out VERY shortly after
Win95...plenty of time to get used to it.  Sheesh. :)

Ok, anyone know of a way to easily toggle the enable/disabling of the
command alt-tab?  I find myself accidentally alt-tabbing out of EQ when at a
vendor.  I hold down ALT to see what I've got do some buying and selling,
and when I'm done I go for the ESC key to exit the merchant.  Well, if my
alt key is down and I want to hit another key with my left hand (I always do
alt-tab with my left thumb and middle finger) my brain just naturally
ASSUMES I want to hit the tab key. Grrrrr

So instead of just being more careful I'm trying for the easy way out. <g>
