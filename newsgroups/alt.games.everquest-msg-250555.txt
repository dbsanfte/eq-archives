I made my druid for the same reason.  But I *do* enjoy playing her.  It sucks
that your *family* guild *made* you become a druid *just* to port them around
and then dumped you when you weren't needed.  They clearly don't realize how
much druids can offer to a group.
FWIW my druid finds plenty to keep her busy besides being someones taxi cab.
