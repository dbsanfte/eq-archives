  Very old news to those of us that read this group, but I bet
there's millions of people that don't play Everquest but do
watch/listen/read CNN and find it very new and disturbing
news. (I am old enough to remember the hysteria created over
Dungeons & Dragons in the early 80's - this sort of story is
just a replay of all that).

  Besides, I saw something in this article that I don't recall
hearing of when news of this guy's suicide was first making the
round in this newsgroup: that the mother thinks he was jilted
by an online love, because one of the names he used was "ILUVYOU".

  I'd take it even a step further and theorize that this loveable loser,
a "geek" in high school that couldn't get dates, got himself into an
intense relationship with some hot wood elf babe, maybe thinking he
was really in love and this was the one - only to find out the person
was really a guy in real life.  It could be just the sort of thing to send
a "troubled" person teetering on the edge of suicide over the brink.
I at least find that explanation more plausible than him killing himself
because a gang of kewl doods stole his Crushbone lunch money.
