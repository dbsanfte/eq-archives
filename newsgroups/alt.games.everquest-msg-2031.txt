Actually you can, but not in the obvious way.

You won't get melee skill increases from bonking
on another PLAYER while dueling, but you can get
increases while dueling by fighting the pet of
the guy you're dueling with (if the pet is blue or
higher to you).  Needless to say, this means you'll
have to be dueling a pet-class caster.
