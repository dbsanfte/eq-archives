Thats so pathetic it should be stripped out of the spell entirely, I 
don't often fight level 5 mobs, and I can't think of one over that level 
that has so little mana that he'd even miss 50 points.  Further, thats 
got to be one crazy twink mob if his HP are enough to live thru three 
strikes of 675 hp damage, but his mana is so low that 50 mana makes him 
unable to Cheal/Gate/mez me.

Splendid
