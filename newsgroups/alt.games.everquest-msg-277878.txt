Yes, yes, I know how to start: get a group doing a mission. But how did THEY
get the faction to start? Kill guards? Or is there a task somewhere in zone 
that
gives faction? I've hailed everyone at the gypsy camp, but they don't seem 
to offer
any tasks related to DoN factions. The npc's at the camps won't talk to me
without some small level of faction first; so how do I get it? Can it be 
done solo,
or is groupong the only way? Is there someone who should talk to me at this 
stage?
