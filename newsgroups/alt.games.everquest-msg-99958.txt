Not true Ben.  Every time I have asked for Gfay and gotten a port from a
druid he has always checked if it is close enough.  Must be at least 4-5
times.  Seems like just common courtesy.  And when I played a wiz I always
checked if Gfay was close enough when asked for bb.  Several times it wasnt
and the person held out for a druid port.
