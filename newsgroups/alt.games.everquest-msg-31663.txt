It's not in the slightest bit different. "Let them police their game".
Why do I have any business reporting ANY violation if I don't have any
business reporting the ones you disagree with?

Your attitude is astronomically childish. Hence "Grow up". Until you
act worthy something else, I shall continue to address you as "boy".

Ooooh! "I'm the rubber, you're the glue!"... How is "fuck the rules!
It's a stupid one, and I don't hafta follow it, and anyone who tattles
is a poopyhead!" more mature than respect for those rules?

At least you admit it, although, doing so only hurts your position
even more.

"Growing up" isn't always indicative of age. Maturity is a state of
mind. So, again... Grow up.

No, it's becoming increasingly clear that you are a sad little
anarchist wannabe who is desperately thrashing.
