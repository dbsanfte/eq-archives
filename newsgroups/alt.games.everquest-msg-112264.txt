Mathmatics and science in general is most enlightening when it tells us
things that do not seem to be. Many, many people then stick their heads in
the sand and refuse to see. In the end you will have to decide which sort of
person you will be . On the bright side the ones who understand this own and
run our world. The rest are generally refered to as lifes losers, the
unlucky , the underpriveleged , and any of a number of appellations all with
the intent of trying to claim it was not their fault they ended up this way.

A mathamatical argument is about the only argument I will accept as proof.
