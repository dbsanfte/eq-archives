Only if you assume that a god required/requires
evolution to exist. 

Perhaps the god has existed/will exist forever.

This is the teaching of Christian dogma, that God
has always been. One of His names is Yahweh,
literally 'Eternal', and as such, He is not
subject to laws of time and space.

Why does a god require a creation myth?

Why does a god need to have his existence
demanded?
