Um... no.  Just as some people might call someone who prefers Eliza to 
Lizzy "Lizzy" simply because she hates the name, some people might use 
"wizzie" as a way to annoy the wizard in question.  And a LOT of people 
might just call Lizzy the Wizzie what they do because they hear the 
name/term, don't hear any objections, and they start to use it 
themselves.  If I'm introduced to someone named Peter as "Pete", I'll 
say "Hi Pete" and call him Pete until I'm told otherwise.  Of course, if 
he flips out at me for it without saying anything, I may think he needs 
to cut back on the caffeine a little...
