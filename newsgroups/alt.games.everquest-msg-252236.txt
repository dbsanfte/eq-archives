Thats a really odd set of levels to recommend for Mistmoore.

In the low 20's, theres not much you can really do there other than camp the
entrance... mid 20's you can kill in the graveyard, maybe the pass.  But if
I remember correctly going into the actual castle (where about 70% of the
mobs in the zone are) was pretty much suicide until you were over 30.   And
even then you had better have a pretty good group.
