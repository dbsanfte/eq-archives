Hi everybody. I currently am  member of a very nice small guild. However 95
percent of the people that play on board are on East Coast time. I was
hoping to get a group of people on the Rathe Server to play on West coast
time. Heck if 10 or more people would volunteer we could even make a small
little guild. I am an adult with a family and work so I cant play 8 to 10
hours a day but still find the game very fun but hard to do much when all
the guild members are 3 hours ahead of me in time.  Not thinking of forming
any heavily organized guild or anything just a group of guys n gals on the
same time that would let someone be on to play with most of the time.

So anyways if your interested in having some fun and are on Pacific Standard
Time or heck even mountain central or whatever that hour ahead time is
called send me an e mail or a tell in game. My characters I play mainly are
54 monk Bremenaerre, 53 wizard Fenadorn and a 13 shammy Corshakkion. Oh yeah
and my wife plays with me to. Her's are 53 cleric Hamadari and 19 warrior
jennaj. We also have one more friend that would go that is on West coast
time.

My e mail is jbhammer@rainierconnect.com


Love to hear from ya
