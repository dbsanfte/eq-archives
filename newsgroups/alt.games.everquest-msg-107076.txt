It's called a potion bag.   A grizzly pelt, a cord and a tailor are
what's needed to make one.   Trivial level is upper 60s.  

I can't figure out why more people with lower to mid class characters
don't use them for carrying loot.  Way cheaper than the 10slot
backpack and they hold a good varied of items.  Grizzly skins are a
dime a dozen compared to HQ bear.
