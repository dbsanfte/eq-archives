It's not *quite* that bad... Even light healing gives back a little
more HP than mana. 
Clerics are the only class that can be showy with their heals, us
other healer classes have to be imaginative :) That's why inner fire
is mentioned, for the HP return it gives for 10 mana. I'll cast my
skin spells before healing up rather than after because of the similar
HP addition from the buff. Since keeping groupmates from getting hurt
is an indirect form of healing, I keep damage shields on those being
hit, and keep mobs snared anyone can outrun them. 
Also, don't top off tank health if it means you'll be oom. Try to keep
a balance between your mana and their health. If you're the only
healer, don't give out every buff you have - stick with the most
important ones.
You're not a cleric, but you actually do have the same healing spells
as one between 9 and 13 and between 19 and 23 and even if you're slow,
you can keep groups alive.
