 Yeah, I've heard a few guilds actually killed him but died to the adds
and they couldn't get back in to get flagged since the globe stops
functioning. I bet that has to suck! You also can't be CoH'd into there.
You can get a CoH to the globe room but not into the lair.

 Good thing about HoH is there isn't much room to kite around.
Unfortunately that area is the Graveyard. Bad zone design considering
those mobs are still snareable and don't summon.
