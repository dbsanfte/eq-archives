Seems to for me.  I bought entrap pretty early actually, maybe around
100 AAs.  It was a better deal when ensnare was the best snare because
the extra spell slot is indeed nice.  Do you keep nukes up?  Tanging
weeds as well as your other snare?  A root?  Heal and jolt?  It's easy
for me to run out of spell gems.

I pull with snare a lot actually.  If I'm chain pulling and need to
keep the next mob under control, if I am worried about an add, if the
tank is gimp and we need the mob slowed on incoming, etc.  But this is
situational.  I don't do this when the mobs hit for 1200+ and I dont do
it if the tank is agro-deficient.  I pride myself on good chain
pulling, so even the time it takes to stop and cast jolt, for me, is
too damn long.

No kidding.  I have 1 for 1h weapons, 1 for my 2her, 1 for archery, 1
for earthcaller (could combine the last two I guess).  I could still
use 2 more.  One for my gate hammer as well as to switch to my weenie
bow for pulling summoners.
