A good tip for druids hunting in EK is to charm a griffawn or if you are
high enough level a Griffon and use them to do the dirty work. I can
go thru a lot of spiders, both carrion and crag using this method with
very little downtime.
If there arent any spiders around kill all the snakes and lions you
can. All the wandering critters are on the same spawn table, so if
there are 500 snakes on your tracking there isnt any room for
the spiders. =)

I got a really good griffon once and went on a rampage. I got
over 80 silk swatches and a buttload HQ cat pelts in about 2 hours
once. The other hunters in the zone thanked me as well because
I was raging on all the snakes and making spiders spawn like crazy.
Griffons are just plain nasty but they are awesome pets. =)

One trick I used when the griffon breaks charm is to root it, re-charm
it and then bring stuff to it to kill until it breaks the root. =) Works great.
