I've never played either one, but that sounds like you're changing the
nature of the question. The question was which class has a better pet
not which class can utilize their pets and spells the most
efficiently. Fear kiting is totally irrelevant; it's not an ability of
the pet.

By your own comments above, you're agreeing that mages have a better
pet.
