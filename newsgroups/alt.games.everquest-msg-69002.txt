Had you just played a Dwarf on FV?
I once had a halfling on FV. Created her, went to my regular server,
played my gnome and talked with people, logged in my main, said
something and got a ton of confused looks. 
The halfling had reset my language to Halfling. My gnome didn't know
halfling and was therefore speaking common, but the default language
did not get reset. My main has maybe half a dozen points in halfling,
and when I logged in, she was using that abysmal language skill to
communicate.

You have to always reset the default language yourself, or you'll get
a surprise the next time you play a character with any skill at all in
the selected language.
