Lived with a fiance who beat me for killing his son. Of course 
the fact that the foetus had *died* about 3 weeks previously, and 
I was toxemic to the point of kidney failure, was hospitalized 
for 2 weeks and went from 135 lbs to 94 lbs and looked like an 
auschwiz posterchild didnt seem to make his notice.
Took me 3 months of dealing with it while making arrangements to 
leave. Been there, done it, abandoned the tshirt to get out 
alive. Promised myself I would never let love blind me to abusive 
behaviors ever again. Of course other than his being very 
controling didnt bother me, and he wasnt violent until after I 
got out of the hospital made it easy to ignore at first. 
Controling wasn't that bad, I percieved it as his way of being 
concerned about me. John's passive agressive behaviors just 
indicated how messed up he really was, and no matter how much 
money he had in the bank, he could not bring himself to trust me, 
and trust is a 2 way street - if you can't trust me, how can i 
trust you=( and you cant have a marriage based on anything BUT trust.
