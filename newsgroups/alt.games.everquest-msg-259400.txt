Oh god, I hope you didn't have to deal with USWe...er...QWest when they
rolled DSL out in this area.  Blech.

Are you sure you're talking about the same Verizon?!

I have found with Verizon that you're fine as long as you don't ever
want to *change* anything.  My worst problems with Verizon and my DSL
have come when I've needed to move, or change my package or something
similar.  Other than that, I haven't had to call them for anything.

Comcast, on the other hand, I don't know much about.  Since I work at a
local ISP up here, and don't actually live in a Comcast area, I haven't
really dealt with them much.  The one time I did deal with them it was
because they needed my help setting up a Mac.  Apparently their Mac
support is either non-existant, or so poor as to be non-existant.
