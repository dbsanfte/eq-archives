  I've always been a fan of a shamans.  Especially since on FV there are
fewer of them than clerics (or so it seems) and if a group doesn't already
have a shaman, most of the time they'll be very happy to add one.  And if
you can't find a group, at least a shaman can solo pretty effectively.

  Jim is right when he says that being a class that can travel can be a big
asset on this server... so in that respect, wizards and druids are good
choices.

  But aside from all that, play what you want to play.  I expect that which
class is the most "popular" during any given month is going to change, so
that's not the best thing to use to determine what class you'll play.
Especially since it's something that can't be accurately measured anyway.

  Good luck.
