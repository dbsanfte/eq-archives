My lvl 26 necro is fighting solo in GD now, tizmaks are doable but i
admit i die a lot, having a druid as a partner shure is a good thing,
with your snare my fear and pet + our DoT's the tizmaks drop fast,
soloing them usually means my pet drops and then i have to run but
usually the mob is badly wounded it will just start walking back and
forth.

GD is a nice zone you can probably stay here for a long long time, but
getting a group or partner at lower level seems impossible..

Going here is not that difficult, you can do it as soon as you get
camo, and in IC you usually don't have to use camo if you follow the
southern shore line, first part of EW same thing, almost not mobs
except if hunted and pulled there, the area around GD zone is harder,
more mobs and some giants, also when entering GD the first part is
filled with wolfs and giants, can be hard to get by without camo, when
at the river the wolfs there are usually the coldain ones and they are
not hostile so it is rather safe :)
