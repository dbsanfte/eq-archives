I tried that....when i get to the website i have 2 choices, either view
account information which just shows my station info, or enter new account
key. When i click that(enter new account key) and try to enter the OoW
account key....it tells me i don't have features that that key requires,
even though i have all the other expansions. There just isn't a button
anywhere i can see that says register expansion., just the 2 buttons i
described, and yes, before you ask, i did install OoW. Any other
suggestions?
