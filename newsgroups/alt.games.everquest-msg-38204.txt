form the article:
"The warrant says the U.S. Attorney's Office suspects the men of crimes that
could put them in federal prison for up to five years". 
Hope it was worth it you pricks.
I love the bit about how they were caught because they posted information to
the web and an 'annonymous' e-mail to sony. Just cant resist advertising their
l33t skillz!!! If they had left it they would have probably got away with it
but their 'I, 0wnz u! I Roxxor' attitude makes them the architect of their own
downfall. Whats so smart about doing 5 years bird?
