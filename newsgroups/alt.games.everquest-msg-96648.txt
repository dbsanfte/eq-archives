Splat levels are the level after a hell level. Since when you die, you lose
a percentage of the XP needed to get you to that level, and you needed much
more XP to get to that level (the hell level), you lose a LOT more XP than
the level before or after. A safety bubble in a splat level isn't enough to
keep you from undinging.

Personally, I am torn. My character that went through all the rights of
passage is whining and wishing everyone else would go through what he went
through. He's 54, and still has three blues to get through. But my necro, at
24, is doing cartwheels. She's happy that she can soon hunt in the middle of
a zone without fear of anything ever sneaking up on her again- or getting
trained without warning. I understand there's a possibility of getting
summon corpse at a younger level too.

And I am very glad that I never will hear another level 1 to 10 idiot
complain about falling in the Hole or whatever ever again.

Hey, anyone else want to skydive with me? I got a twinked level 9 in
Paineel. Let's jump in the Hole and come back to our bind points.- first
person to dive 5 times wins a prize. Jazz, we can twink your Hole mule with
Jboots or a horse now- he'll never lose his stuff. I see a whole bunch of
sporting activities beginning from this.
