Thanks good thing to know, having some resists now in OT on engulfing darkness
but not more than i can live with, i only need to find a good spot to pull to
and fear, was thinking of the area behind the portal, seems to be free of 
wandering mobs, the area between the portal and thurg may not be to good, many 
people run there and i shure have no wish to get others into trouble, maybe i 
could team up with someone that can root then use dot's

Have for the moment left the area and are doing my first step on the epic, 
stuck now at the point where i need to kill a lvl 33 pally :(

Thanks for the info.

/Regards Berth (Thotamon 7th circle DE necro luclin)
