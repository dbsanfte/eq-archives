So why does any mob on my pet immediately go for me the second I nuke it,
unless my pet is damshielded?

I don't say you're wrong, but my experiences have pointed in this direction
so far.

In fact, I've had this problem just last night. I was soloing in OT. I
damshielded my pet, pulled a mob with Malise, ran to the zone-hill, waited
for the mob to come up a bit and chugged my pet to it.
After counting to 3 I started casting a rain spell. If the rain is resisted
one or two times, I do a small nuke after it as well. Went fine for a an
hour or two.

Then one time I forgot to damshield my pet beforehand. I did the same as
above and, sure as hell, the mob turned to me after the 2nd wave of the rain
hit it. If I couldn't get another nuke in I probably would have died because
of it.

Maybe it was an odd coincidence in which my pet didn't do enough damage the
single time I didn't damshield it, but I tend to believe it was the no-ds
that almost got me killed.
