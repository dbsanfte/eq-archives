There is a way.  Just the day before this thread started someone did it in
the bard channel.  His first try it came out wrong and came out
%T
which when clicked showed some kind of blue vial kind of component, I forget
exactly what.  He then tried again and got it to come out
ladies panties
or something like that.  He wouldnt say how he did it.
