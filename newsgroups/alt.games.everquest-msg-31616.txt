Make friends with someone a few levels above you who is willing to mentor a 
true newbie. Those people exist, and they can be a great aid in helping. 
Don't abuse their help, however. Try and read about the game, the manual is 
pretty good starters. The EQ guide on GameSpot is also a good starting 
place. For more detailed reading, there's plenty of great web sites. 

Also I might recommend doing a warrior for your first char. It's a lot 
simpler, but still not boring if you do a lot of the trade skill stuff and 
upper level skills, and tanks are always needed for groups. Besides, after 
you get tired of it, you could switch to something else. Also, don't let 
your friend "twink" you too much, you don't want to be in a position where 
you haven't learned how to play the game when you get to the higher levels 
because you breezed through it. I got to level 4 with a dwarf warrior in 3 
hours, by myself without twinking, and this was only my 3rd char, none of 
which were higher than 8th at the time. Learn your newbie quests in your 
area, they make the early levels go a lot faster.  

I can say that it took some time to aquire a taste for EQ, but once you "get 
it" it can be a blast. I have no experience with AC so I don't know how 
favorably it compares. If you're looking for PVP, however, you've probably 
come to the wrong game, based on what I've read about it.
