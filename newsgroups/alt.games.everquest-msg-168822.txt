I think you are seriously misrepresenting conservatives.  I am a
conservative, and I have a permissive view on all of the above except for
abortion, which I view as murder, plain and simple.  Now, it's possible that
I have been traveling the road between conservative and libertarian over the
past few years, but I think you will find that most prominent conservatives
fall out somewhere between the religious right and libertarian.

Personally, I'd love if we had a two-party system... Republican and
Libertarian.

Which is the tact that many conservatives take, to varying degrees.  Even
the most aggressive libertarian will accept that there most be some
governmental action, otherwise we simply have anarchy.
