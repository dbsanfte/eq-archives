Do NOT stay in FM just to get a Loop. I liked the place, got good XP there, and
some ok loot for guild newbies.
I soloed at the DL zone entrance from 29 to 34 (was in CT half of level 30 on a
raid), and i got 1 Forest Loop in that time. After level 31 i only killed giants
unless i didnt even have any on track.
But the other loot in the zone is ok, Lumberjack Cap and Giant Lords Tunic is
nice items for newbies in the guild, and the 3 weapons the giant drop can sell
at vendors for around 40pp each.
But dont stay there just to get a loop, its not worth it.
