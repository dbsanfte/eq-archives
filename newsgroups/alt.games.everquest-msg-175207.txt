As you progress through your 50's and 60's, your main buffs become "group"
buffs anyway.

So you cast 1 spell (e.g tali of brute) that gives your entire group
stamina - you will see yourself when its fading and re-cast.   And honestly,
why would losing a buff for a short period make such a difference?

I don't time buffs..  if its a single version spell (e.g PoP focus) I start
with F2, and work my way through the group casting it on them (skipping
clerics, obviously).. then when the first person says "focus fading".. I
know its going to fade for everybody soon, and re-start the order.

If im buffing my shaman too, i'll start with him, then I can see myself when
its fading (i usually don't bother tho, not like he gets smacked around all
that much)

Im a lazy shaman though, I only cast focus, stamina, agility(if asked) and
avater for buffs (plus obviously malo, turgers, krag/tnarg/torp heals, tears
of sar and nukes).

Regen is a no-no.. I have the new PoP group version (blessing of
replenishment).. but it doesn't stack with my monks 10th coldain ring (such
bs).. and haste?  Find a chanter !

Of course some of this is the mindset of my shaman being a bot (albeit a
damn hard working one), and grouping with guildies who already have the
gear/primal to max things like STR and Dex
