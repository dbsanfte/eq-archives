EQ requires very little thought to play.  Perhaps they are drawn to the
illusion of playing a game that requires thinking, allowing them to feel
leet without actually having to make any real effort.  Surely someone as
leet as you doesn't labor under the illusion that EQ is hard do they?

To the blind there are no landmarks.  To those who rely on /loc to
navigate there are no landmarks.  I on the other hand have navigated
strictly by landmarks since beta.  I don't need to stop and /loc if I
need to flee, I look where I am and am instantly able to relate that to
where I want to be and vector accordingly.  I assure you that sans /loc
that each server community would have come up with it's own well known
vernacular regarding landmarks and navigation between them.  Without
such a recognized system I would simply tell the other player to do
exactly what I would do, knowing where they are and where they need to
be is a simple matter of providing a vector which can be expressed in
terms of either clock position or degrees from a known vector.  Again,
those capable would survive, those incapable would perish.  Of course
the bottom line would have suffered since those unable to actually deal
with <gasp> thinking would have soon canceled their subscriptions, so VI
determined that /loc would remain.

No, those folks rely on /loc and would have left with everyone else who
couldn't deal with it's removal.  By making the game more difficult, by
raising the bar for survival in EQ rather than continually lowering it
as they did, VI could have created a much better game for those who
played.  The most annoying players, the ones you describe, leaving would
have been but one of the benefits.  That is not what a business is about
though, it is about profits, and they have done very well in that regard
despite the failures in terms of gaming.  The more I consider  it the
more I realize that we may never see the best potential games from a
gamers standpoint as they would by nature of difficulty exclude too
large a portion of potential profit base to  be funded.  I know I should
be more concerned about starving children or the rape of our
constitution, but somehow this realization is one of my greatest
concerns in life.  I wonder if I could get Sally Struthers to make an
appeal for donations to a fund to create such games? <eg>
