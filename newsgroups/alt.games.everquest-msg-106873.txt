Loot. They drop good cash and bronze brigandine (chain class) armor 
which isn't half bad for the level, and sells for a couple of plat 
per piece at vendors.

Also, one of the camps is right by a zone line. As Ben pointed out,
it reminds one very much of the Shralok orc camp in Highpass, bad
manners and all. Even on sparsely populated Firiona Vie, there's
a group at the southern bandit camp pretty much 24/7.
