I love Win2k.  I won't run it with EQ though.  If you have anything better
than a 16bit sound card (ie, something 5 years old) and actually want to
take ADVANTAGE of all the cool things added, like 3d sound, Win2k won't
handle it.  You'll get a lot of stuttering and won't hear as much as you do
on your Win9x machine.

Of course, you can also turn off your sound acceleration...but then you've
just made your $100+ sound card into a $5 16bit Sound Blaster and will no
longer get 3d sound or any other bells and whistles.
