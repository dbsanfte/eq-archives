I'm in a small guild... I find that generally, if I can't solo it, and not 
everyone wants it, I'm probably screwed.  Sebilis and HS I quite enjoyed 
the key quests for.  VP I've only done a piece or two, but I'm confident I 
can eventually get all but Trakanon.  The raid force ones I may actually be 
able to get done with the guild... We're having a lot of people talking 
about doing the PoI dragon.  Trials were somewhat a disappointment, but I 
think that had mostly to do with me still being so low level that the only 
way through would be if the guild built a group of 5 that could do exe 
without me, and then tossed me in it.  That may be more fun in another 5 
levels.  VT I haven't even vaguely considered.  Our guild is -so- far from 
being able to do emp...  Well, ok, I lied, I have at least two lucid shards 
in the bank. :)

I guess really the only ones I feel strongly reluctant about are the hard 
key quests.  All keyed zones seem to make pickup groups very hard to come 
by though, except seb, and since I'm frequently solo, that's pretty 
frustrating.  I have HS keys on two of my characters, and have had them for 
about a month now, but still haven't even been there.

Having keyed zones seems to enforce the tiered system of guilds.  I'm not 
sure how I feel about that, since I'd much rather choose a guild on the 
basis of liking the people than on the basis of uberness, and that 
seems rather likely to exclude me from ever seeing endgame content.

I'm not sure how much I'd like the endgame content anyway, though.  There 
never seems to be mobs I can hail and interact with, or work up insane 
faction with and do a quest.  But that seems different in PoP... some 
quests are being found in the higher planes that sound quite fun.
