Wrong about that one, sonny. I wrote and gamemastered a D&D game with the
same group of young adults for seven years. Based one the White Box with the
three books inside, and the precious Greyhawk supplement.

All of us wanted to fight evil -- so I created a game that was a questing
story, with real villians and mysteries and such. I rigged the world so that
my group was consistently tempted towards "evil" deeds, and in the end, the
Necromancer made them pay for every step towards the dark side....

Of course, they won and blasted the Necromancers back to the hell they came
from. We tried playing after that, but the world was just a little too
boring. So we had babies and bought houses.
