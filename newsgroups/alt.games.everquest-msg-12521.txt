I'd just like to have a start of poll. How many people here buy SoW potions?
And how much would you pay? I ask since I've only managed to sell one 10
dose since the TBoots arrived (and I'm hoping that's just bad luck). I've
not got a lot of money to tie up in this at the moment and I'm hoping to
hear that they're still useful to most people.

While we're on the subject, what other potions do people buy? I would guess
IvU and Shrink. Dunno about gate potions as the Thurgadin one seems a lot
cheaper to make (master potter, skill still rising :)

Cheers,
