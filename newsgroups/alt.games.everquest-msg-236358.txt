| Is your Mortar & Pestle in the bank?  Shortly after coming out the Mortar

Mortar and Pestle only works for rogues with make poison skill now. I tried
with a level one rogue and that didn't work, needed a rogue above level 20
with skill to be able to use the new UI. It did work fine shortly after
release for all though. The tinkering container seems to have the same sort
of restriction.
