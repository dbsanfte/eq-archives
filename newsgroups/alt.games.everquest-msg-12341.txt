Hi Paul,

To be honest with you, getting gifst as a start out is a fair deal.  Also,
within the next 10 levels, you'll go through that and make 2 - 3x as much...

My druid was gifted starting out by a player with some nice equipment and
some cash.  It got him started but by the time he cleared his 9th level
spells, he had gone through the massive bounty...  By 24th leve I'd earned 5
times what you are describing and he's got maybe 60pp to his name - he can
make that easily in an hour or 2 - the sum he has won't even put a dent in
his next batch of spells <grin>.

A major difference between twinking and what happened to you is a gift --
unexpected.  Unasked for.  A true and honest gift from a more senior player
to you.  If you are worried about it, put it in the bank and let it sit.
Have faith, it won't sit that long before you'll find a use for it.  Just
remember the gift and pass it on later when you get to those levels...  See
both how it makes you feel as well as the unexpected person you help out.

Best wishes and I hope everything sits better with you.
