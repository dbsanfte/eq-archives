What gets me about "football" aka "soccer" is the offsides rule.
Who the hell thought that one up, slow teams?  If a player is
fast enough and skilled enough to get the ball ahead of the def-
enders, why punish them and make them wait for the other team 
to catch up?  Same goes for hockey, too (i think they have a 
similar rule).  Not so in American football, which is one reason I'll
watch that over soccer any day (it's known as soccer in the
US so that is what I call it) .  Plus, American football fans don't
riot and kill each other.
