Yes there is!

Iksar make the best Necros.   The extra AC and Regen really pumps up a
Necro, with no down side.  Necro all the way!

The other classes Iksar don't really do much for.  

Warriors would be good with the regen, but the lack of great STA coupled
with not being able to use much of the warrior armor make it a poor
choise.

Shadownights suffer the same problems as warriors, plus not having as
much use for the regen, being able to heal with lifetaps.

Monk would be great (and this is the 2nd best IMHO) for Iksar but the
lower HTH damage of an Iksar more than takes away the benefit of higher
AC & Regen.  

Beastlords I'm not sure about, I imagine the lower HTH of Iksar for
monks would travel to Beastlors and make them less than ideal, but don't
know for sure, the regen isn't very useful since they heal and don't
have any other spells to take advantage of it like Necros or Shaman.

Shaman are pretty good, but the lack of some (very) key items & some
armor also makes them much less attractive, besides which you have a
shaman already.
