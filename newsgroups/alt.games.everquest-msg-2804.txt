Its nearly impossible to get reliable figures since often real females
hide that fact on the net (stalking), many players of EQ might be
children but the account name/info is in the name of an adult who also
filled out their age since they are the credit card holder,  etc. Also
many people fill out the wrong age/sex info for no other reason than
to throw off statistics ( I often do this) since they don't like to be
"marketed" to as a demographic.

Taking all that into account, I think it mostly turns out to be male
and in the early 20's. No big surprise there.
