I wasn't aware the thread portion had throttled down to
a single group thing.  I'll try to stay with you though for
the sake of this subportion.

Raid or group though, with one mob in camp you should
indeed be sitting down, assuming the MA has had a
decent amount of time to establish aggro and you haven't
just done something to put yourself back on top, like drop
a big nuke or mod rod yourself nearly to death.

Not at all.  Someone else suggested "let it heal naturally"
As a cleric, I would never consider such a thing seriously.
If ther's visible damage, then I assume it will never ever
go away on its own, just as I assume a rock will stay in the
middle of a stream forever, in its original shape.  Of course
the les heal enabled classes will argue that wounds DO
heal naturally, just as the sculpted shapes in the Grand Canyon
argue against my original shape feeling... but in both
cases the change is so glacially slow as to be beneath my
visual acuity.  If I'm saying anything, its that you stand and
wait for a heal.

I'll get to you.  Just not if someone important is being hurt.  If
you die because I was healing someone more important... well
thats honestly part of my job.  An unpleasant part, I might add.
Choosing who will live and who will die.  Explaining afterwards
"we needed the other guy more than we needed you."  Writing
home to the widow.  Rough.  Welcome to the Corps, chaplain
Bergh.

You don't expect heals in that situation.  I'm not offering
heals in that situation.  You expect heals when injured
and the healer isn't otherwise busy... I expect to heal you
in that situation.We appear to agree completely.


I get in arguements like this with my wife all the time, we
agree on something, but both think the other is disagreeing.
Its always a knock down drag out arguement because we
are both so sure we are right... and what do you know, we
both are!
