Like most people, my PR and DR are really really crappy. I have FR/CR/MR
over 100 (or did on MR until I sold my bloodmetal earring for Mask of the
STalker), but I can't get the other two past 50 without sacrificing my
other stats.  ANd now I"m wondering about replacing my imbued granite
spaulders with drape of the proud, which would take me down below 40 on
FR/DR.

Here's what I've begun to notice though, fighting in Droga (which has more
casters than you can shake a stick at).  Nukes HURT.  Malo annoys to no
end, and fear SUCKS!  But dots and slow don't last more than 2 seconds and
barely hurt my HP because Rak is quick with the cures.  And that's the
thing...most spells that PR/DR work against can be cured.  There are some
nukes based on poison, but they are smaller numbers than their ice/fire
counterparts. But FR/CR...there is no "curing" those...they hit you and
they've done their nasty work.  MR spells can't be removed without
removing other buffs (we tried keeping the top slot open to dispel malo,
but 25% of the time it would ignore malo and dispel some other buff), or
else they do the worst and take your control from you (ala mez, charm, and
fear).  So I'm beginning to wonder if having good PR/DR in my normal gear
really matters.  Not to mention that my husband has talisman of epuration
(and the higher level one he rarely uses).

Is there anything I'm forgetting?  If I were to go on a raid that dealt
with DoTing mobs, I'd bring resist gear. But for someone who spends most
of their time in Veksar, Nadox, and Droga (until I find some regular
friends, LDoN just has nothing for me)...is there any reason to take 10
PR/DR over 65 hp, 8 dex, 5wis, and 35 mana (I love nuking a lot with my
ranger, so mana is a pretty big deal to me)?  I've not visited Hate's Fury
yet, and it's definitely on my list of places to make a regular spot for
me, so I'm curious as to whether PR/DR is any more important there than in
Droga.  (I hear that zone has a lot of casters.)
