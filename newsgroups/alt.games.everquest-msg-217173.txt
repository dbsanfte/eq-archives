rofl, i have a very good friend who Rps iksars. met him originally as a 
monk on Sol Ro, though he has bopped over to firiona vie server and 
started all over again as a SK. met him when he was an applicant to the 
guild i was in at the time. Took about 3 weeks of RP to get to where he 
became less than surly towards me....esentially i 'took a thorn out of 
his paw' - he made peace with my iksar shaman husband and had to cope 
with the softskin wife...it 'helped' that i didnt immediately try to 
kill him when he was serioulsy injured and i healed him instead.

I have an iksar SK on FV myself, and when I play her I log into 
cabilis:cabilis to RP along with the rest of his FV guild. I too prefer 
to speak in lizard, will sort of admit to speaking elvish if I have to 
deal with the lesser races....and think that elves are better spitroasted=)
