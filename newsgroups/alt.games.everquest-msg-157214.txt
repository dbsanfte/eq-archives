My monk died for the first time at lvl 5. Was a good laugh too.
I was trying kill a yellow(had some buffs) but they ran out during the fight
and my HP dropped, so I quickly ran to the guards and then I did something
stupid. I hailed to the guard. LOL...I was dead in 1 sec. Somehow it hit his
own attack button and then targeted me when the mob ran behind me..
