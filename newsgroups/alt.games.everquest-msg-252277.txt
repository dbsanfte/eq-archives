Dominant? Maybe not. But they've successfully repositioned Windows
from a toy OS (real men use Unix, grunt) to a mid-market enterprise
alternative. They're not going for GM, but you can run a $500 million
firm really well on a Windows platform, and do it with sys admins that
cost 1/2 of what Unix does.

Then, they kept plugging away at SQL Server in the same segment,
asking that $500 million CIO why he needs Oracle at $40,000/CPU plus
hot&cold running consultants. SQL Server has carved out about a
15-share of the DBMS market and is accelerating. IBM is growing there
by acquisition, and Larry E. is reduced to crying at the feds about
PeopleSoft. MS will gnaw you to death if you ignore the
currently-small customer opportunity.

IBM isn't "down" but they've changed. Despite what most people still
believe IBM has become a consulting company, not a core manufacturer
of hardware and software. They do that, but it's consulting that sells
the iron and code. They have over 135,000 working IT consultants after
the acquisition of PWC; it's now the Big-4 (Deloitte, Accenture,
Bearing Point, CapGem) instead of Big-5.

I don't think so, just matured. The changes are more waves than
cliffs.
