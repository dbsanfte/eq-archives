Same goes for charged items, I think.  When I happen to get a charged item,
I'm always very reluctant to use the charges, unless I'm sure that a better
occasion won't arise.  I'm sure my Stein of Mogguk is going to have its
three charges of Light Healing forever, for instance.

For both potions and charged items, I think they need some reasonable way to
recharge them (aside from the vendor exploit).  E.g., for potions, make it
so that alchemists can recharge them.  Recharging uses components that can
be bought from vendors, and recharging a given potion trivials at 1/2 the
skill level that making it trivials at.
