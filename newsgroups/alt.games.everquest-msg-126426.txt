Yay!  Finally got the young ronin to spawn.  There were some higher levels in
the zone trying to get the AC to spawn, and all their killing of rares was accelerating
the rare I was looking for... I think.  Who knows about this stuff, lol; it could all
just be luck.  In any case, I shouted a couple of times that I was looking for him
and was pointing out SG's to the higher levels when the SG spawned.  Eventually,
the young ronin spawned and a high level DE wizard nailed him with one shot
and let me loot!  Well, I stood up from looting him, and who walks up and takes
a swing at me?  Another young ronin!  must have been his twin brother.  He was
an easy kill for me at 24, though.   All those hours of waiting, and two show up
together.  From what the DE wizard said, two had been around earlier too, so
maybe it's common for them to spawn a pair.
