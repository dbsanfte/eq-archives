*go word by word through my sentance* OK,you are right...data is the noun
there.  I was thinking "year", but that is actually part of the modifying
phrase "year's worth".

Doesn't mean I might not have screwed up on the "data" though...you'd
think with a bachelors in biology, a minor in "Data Analysis" and a PhD
father who howls at me when I misuse "data" that I'd never get it wrong,
but I have an obstinant brain.
