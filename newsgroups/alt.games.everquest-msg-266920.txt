I am having no problem starting over in EQ2 as I have always played the game 
as entertainment and for the social aspect of it. I am finding EQ2 to be a 
far superior experience to EQ1.

I also think it is quite funny that the people who play the game in a ultra 
competetive pissing contest fashion are having problems leaving their uber 
EQ1 characters behind and "getting dirty with the unwashed masses" again.

"But, but, there are now level 65 druid guildies to powerlevel me, and I 
don't have a level 70 character to farm twink items either - how the heck am 
I meant to play now?"
