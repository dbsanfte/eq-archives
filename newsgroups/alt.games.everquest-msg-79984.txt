Penny for my thoughts (I'll hand out change later), I bought PCZone because
of the rumours I'd heard about EverQuest before. Now after four or five days
of life sucking gameplay, I think I am suitably hooked. Playing a Druid
(attempting the walkthrough listed in the mag), but generally the most
striking point of the game is the FUN. Jeez, meeting people on the same
level, joining forces, this game has a lot of life left in it. I have only
been reading this newsgroup for a couple of days since getting the demo, but
it seems like I'm here to stay for a while. Just bite the bullet and pay the
subscription :(

FYI:

Any other PCZoners like us, here's a bit of info on buying the game proper:

As stated above, you can purchase the Trilogy for US$30 (+$9 shipping) ,
which includes the Ruins of Karnack and Scars of Velious expansion packs.
The Shadows of Luclin is being sold for US$20.

Amazon.co.uk are offering the Shadows of Luclin at �16, and the Scars of
Velious at �14. That's yer lot.

There are no EverQuest products on Jungle or Gameplay as far as I can see.
