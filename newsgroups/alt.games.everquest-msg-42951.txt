Ouch. I had the amazing luck one day to catch a wave of people "needing" ports out
of FV, and made close to 600pp over the course of 3 hours. It was wonderful, it has
also never happened again hehe :)

It's a decent way to make money, and a really good way to finish getting your
(non-quest) level 29 spells, but by mid-30's I doubt anyone is making money faster
than they could by exping in a good loot zone or practicing a trade skill at a high
skill level.
