I don't see them as PCs, I see them as in game customer support, but...
I dont need to know that he's john whitcher from des Moines.  Allanon is

I do see your point, I just disagree.  I feel that GMs and Guides are
OOC encounters,  as much as they try to roleplay the whole bit as
avatars of the Gods.  They are customer service, they aren't here to
play they are here to help.
