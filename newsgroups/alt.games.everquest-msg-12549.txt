Well, you haven't mentioned weight, but I would recommend first going
from the ring mail to Banded(weight less and ac higher) or bronze
slightly more weight and better AC.  Lose the Jade electrum bracer and
the ivory,  Replace with polished bone bracers Evil Eyes in Gorge. 
There are some new improved blackened iron items in the new runnyeye,
including a neck upgrade.

is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
