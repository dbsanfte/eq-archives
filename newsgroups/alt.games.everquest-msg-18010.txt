Hail all ;-)
Just a question i would like to hear your opinions about,
1st: Its the old twinking problem.
I started some characters and see myself still as a newbie.
Chars are lvls 7-16 now.
I find it more than frustrating to see almost all chars round lvl 5-10
(or even under) with armor and weapons like 50+  !
Why should we do anymore quests ? Just make one highlvl and then twink
the next few - is that the way ? I dont believe in that.
2nd: Why all that shouting ?
I know i can suppress it with options but i think it is ok in SOME
cases. Im on Brell Serilis now and you cant even read as fast as
people shout Topics ooc in the chatwindow.
I consider it as a a very sad fact cause im roleplaying live and
pen&paper for years and it IS a big break in athmosphere i think.
Anyway - i understand that other people have other opinions about that
so pls do me a favour and give me response if im alone with mine.
(BTW ironically people accuse me of beeing twinked cause i have to ask
for some in-game abbreviations cause im germane and have some language
problems ...)
Thanks in advance
