You don't say which add on, regular EQ/velious /kunark/luclin etc.

32 meg of ram was really too small for everquest even back in the day
though. The minimum was around 128 meg pre luclin. You really HAVE to
get more ram, at least 128 meg. At that point you'd find it was
playable by:

disablling all luclin models
NOT installing luclin with the option to upgrade old world textures
(LEAVE THOSE AS THEY ARE)
Turn on texture cache
Turn on 3d texture cache if it works on your card, otherwise turn 
that off it cause a problem.
In display, in game, turn clipping to about 5 percent.
In options set textures to LOW

I am currently on a 
p2 400
Geforce 2 mx 400, 64 meg card
576 meg of system ram
Ultra ATA 100 40 meg hard drive.

In EQ I never upgraded old textures.
I am using old models (though I have velious textures
enabled, and play fine like that so I left them in for
eye candy (no velious textures with the new luclin models))
I have texture cache on
I have d3d texture compression on
I have clipping at about 5 percent
Textures set to low

Instead of going through and disabling all luclin models, I just
edited a couple lines near the bottom of the [defaults] section
in my
eqclient.ini
which is in your EQ directory.

AllLuclinPcModelsOff=TRUE
UseLuclinVahShirMale=FALSE
UseLuclinVahShirFemale=FALSE

That turns them all off at once, while you can still have them enabled
in the lines above that. In this way you can switch from them all to
none just by leaving the game and changing that one line in the 
eqclien.ini. The next two lines make it so you use the
new/old like vah shir models. They basically look the same
but are the vah shir textures on wood-elf looking body's with a kitty
head. I got used to them pretty quick

I feel I have somewhere around the MINIMUM to play luclin.
With old models I do pretty darn well, even in the bazaar with
450 people.

Oh, I also have particle effects off (epics, etc)
and spell effects off, mip mapping off also (uses
resources to blend out textures and such depending
on your distance from them)

Really you need a minimum of 256 meg ram
p2 300 or so
geforce mx 64 meg
to play eq now WITH only old models.
Because the system I named, my system
as well, would now be horribly outdated
its pretty much worth it now just to get a 
new one.

This is a pretty well optimized [defaults]
section of the eqclient.ini. I do have dynamic
lights on, since without particles and such 
it doesn't seem to really lag me at all. Without
it on you can't tell which wisps or other things
have a "light". ;)
When I was using my tnt 16 meg, which was also fine,
I had USE TnL off, because that card did not have
hardware transform and lighting, the geforce does.
Show grass, is only some of the 3d grass protrusions
in luclin outdoor zones. 
I left the do proper tinting command in, though it
does nothing with old models, so that if at some
time I suddenly want to use luclin models again
I can just change that
section
AllLuclinPcModelsOff=TRUE
UseLuclinVahShirMale=FALSE
UseLuclinVahShirFemale=FALSE
to false, true, true and have it be lke it was. 
I turned them off for the bazaar/jagged pine zones, 
which were particularly bad.
