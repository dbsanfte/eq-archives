Yup, levitate if you are forgetful =)

Nah, the large undead gnoll is a random spawn off any 1st floor kill.

>some say it takes a while.

Worst key drop in the zone.  Pack a lunch, you will be there a while
for 1 and days and nights to outfit a full group.  Its worth it tho,
dont go higher than 2 unless somebody in the group has this key locked
away in the bank.  Nothing is worse than dying on floor three and
camping for keys again, or looking for some kind soul to help you CR
up there.

>3rd floor is tougher undead/live mix, spawn for key

Key spawns most often in the kitchen, fairly quickly.

>4th is maze, lots of casters, got lost several times, finally logged

Kill Amonephetra, when he is dead Cara ormica spawns.  Kill her, get a
nice loot and 1 key.  Kill random mosters until Amon spawns, Rinse
Repeat.

Level 5 the mobs are EASIER and the loots are BETTER.  Tons of fun.

Level 6 is fun, watch the dragon trap, and kill the Geni for the next
key.

Level 7 is Tserinna.  She drops the best looking robe in the game,
very rarely, and I'm proud to wear it.  She has some other nice drops
including a nice monster summoning focus for mages.

It also happens to be the most fun and profitable zone in the game.

Perfect levels for you, especially if you get a few friends.

Single pulls are cake in here, dont even need a monk.  Of course, at
level 53, I like to pull 15 at a time on 2nd floor and Jylls em to
smithereens =)

>>Any

Yes, nice drops on all floors.  Floor two has the Teachers Syllabus
and Students homework.

>>Traps to be aware of? 

None to worry about until floor 4 (pit traps) and 6 (Dragon statue
AOE)  There is a funny trap on floor 2 but dont worry about it, it
wont hurt too much.

Bring a full group and see how far ya get.  Dont get discouraged
camping the keys, the rewards are worth it and greater the higher ya
go.  Level 5 has some nice items you will like, trust me.

If you want more details send mail to samuel.posten@ilex.com since I
dont read the newsgroups every day...
