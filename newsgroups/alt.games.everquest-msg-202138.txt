I never seriously played a hybrid class before but I am planning to
start one soon. Either a Shadow Knight or a Beast lord. I can give him
a few twinks (but not truely spectacular; think of stuff as Polished
Steel Ulak).
Which one is most fun? Which one is best in soloing but still wanted
in groups?
What race to be? I been thinking troll if SK and Iksar if BL.

And as a last question; do hybrids get the same damage bonuses as
warriors and so get at levl 30+ ?
