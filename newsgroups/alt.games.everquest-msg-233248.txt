You can also, for example, export a playlist (I used WinAMP) and put
it in a folder near where the EQ MP3 player looks by default, to save
time on loading.

Be careful, though, the MP3 player can contribute to Link Death if you
don't have a lot of memory.  Even with 512 MB RAM I go LD more often
when I have the MP3 player going than when I don't.  Unfortunate, but
I can always play music using my laptop or radio (stereo's in the
living room, unfortunately).

Game on,
