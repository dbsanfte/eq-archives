Hail,
 For about the last week my secondary computer has crashed at every
single load attempt. I get to the server select screen, choose my
server, then BOOM the error message "EQGame has caused an error in
EQGFX_DX8.DLL".  I have deleted and redownloaded both the DX8.DLL and
the EQGame files, but no change. I have all expansions except SoL
installed. I am running an older video card, a Voodoo 3 and am surviving
on 116 RAM on this puter ( hey, my other is a new Dell, I run two
accounts ). Any suggestions? Thanks in advance to the group!
