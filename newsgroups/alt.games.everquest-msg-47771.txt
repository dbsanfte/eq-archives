Ink of the Dark is nodrop, I'm pretty sure.  However, it can be
multiquested (some other person gets Ink of the Dark for you, gives it
to Stofo Olan, and then you give the white paper and mechanical pen to
Stofo.  Whoever turns in the last item will get the Copy of Notes.  

Getting the Ink of the Dark involves charming the ghoul scribe in LGuk.  I
don't know if it requires only indifferent faction with him (meaning
you can charm him and have a friend turn in the empty vial), or if you
need to be amiable.  If amiable is required, the person doing the
charming must turn in the ink vial, which limits it to enchanters and
necros.

This first step is the only part of the enchanter epic that can be
mutiquested.  After this, everything is nodrop, and must be combined in
special bags before turning in.
