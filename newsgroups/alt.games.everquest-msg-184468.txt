The easiest way to handle stuff like this is (1) never do transfers with
anyone without a guild tag; (2) if this guy did have a guild tag, report him
to the guild leader.

1. People in guild are more trustworthy (usually) because, not only will
that member find himself blacklisted on the whole server, but his guild
faces the same problem.

2. Guild leaders are in a much better position to handle things like this.
