Ok, first the milestone.

/em does the dwarven snoopy dance

My cleric is 39 today!  Yay me - that was a major goal for quite some
time.  :-)  My guildies are happy too.  We have one other rez-capable
cleric, but his time is a little more limited than mine.  Granted,
he's 54... but, it seems I'll do in a pinch.  

Now the question:

Mob exp.  What gives?  The last few blues of 38 were driving me nuts,
so a friend and I strategized a bit.  He's a 53 druid, so he took me
to CS with him.  Sure, I got exp as he quaded, no complaints, but we
were (*ahem*) sneaking on from work, so time was of essense.  So, he'd
run out and root one, toss on a dot or two and then I'd pop up and
start casting root for all I was worth.  We were doing Wyrvens.  Most
yellow to me, some red.  As I watched that blue line INCH up, I
realized something quite odd:  Each yellow wyrven was giving different
amounts of experience!  Some as much as a third of a blue, some would
barely move the blue line a few pixels it seemed.

Why is that?  I'm guessing (PURELY guessing) that there are multiple
levels that are yellow to me now?  If so, that would make sense, "low
yellows" vs. "high yellows" give different experience.  This is my
oldest char, so I have no clue if that's true or not.  If not, how to
explain the rather radical difference in experience?

Oh - final thought:  what levels are spectres?

<mwuhahahaha>  Can I get revenge now?
