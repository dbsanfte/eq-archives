    In addition to the information listed here, let me add: For a druid, the
mobs when you first enter a zone and hit track are in "no particular order".
They aren't listed alphabetically, or by closest mob, or anything at all.
Once you are in the zone though, the list will track mobs where that mobs
that spawn are at top of the list. So, if you enter a zone and kill the only
4 gnolls in the zone, then sit and wait a half hour, you will see 4 new
spawns at the top of the list representing the 4 gnolls that popped to
replace them. This can be somewhat useful, especially if you are using track
to wait for a named spawn. If he's not there when you zone in, you can watch
the top of the track list and see when he pops.
