And haven't really raided with one who does.  One epic cleric on the raid cuts
wipeout recovery time from  45 mins to 15.    Mid combat resurrections, etc..
raise this even higher.  Just plain not having to stop whatever you're doing
for 5 mintues whenever anyone in the zone dies, even better.

*nod*  I've seen a level 60 ranger single pull the Spectral Turnkey from
Karnor's basement all the way to Left Corner through fully spawned camps,
where our (too small to go inside) group killed it.  He did it several times
that night.
