I�m meleeing my arse off in the LOIO, and I�m 23... Around this time, my
damage shields are inflicting considerable pain (and of course, they
work well because I�m getting hit A LOT =). If Creeping Crud at 22 is a
much better DoT than Swarm is, I may consider just kiting, but on the
other hand, Wolf Form is supposed to have an increased attack factor,
which will keep me in the brawl until 25-26, by my own reckoning.
Probably no more, because some of the blows are beginning to seriously
hurt.
