"Crimson Light of a Winter's Twilight". I'll take my comission in plat 
or L33t Dr00d G3aR.

I find myself almost physically unable to pay any attention to my alts 
when I know Hanrahan is four levels (four long-arse levels, admittedly) 
from the cap. I wish this wasn't so, because I really fancy playing a 
Necromancer and kicking some butt for a change. My necro languishes at 
16.

That's pretty much why I don't think I could get into playing a melee 
character, although I've been tempted by paladins and rangers...

Your frog is 33 already? I would weep, but then again I've witnessed 
Martin's rogue go from 1 to 60 in less time than it takes me to root-dot 
a Disturbed Elysian Remains :)
