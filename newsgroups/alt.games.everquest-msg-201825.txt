best used when soloing and when searching for a pc/npc...it's situational,
but very useful generally

quite so, yes

the damage will be reduced, but depending on where you hunt, that might not
be too big an issue

bow kiting is done best when the mob is snared, debuffed (some fire dots
lower ac), and dotted, so the mana pool helps

and a good bow + noobiest arrows you can find will get the job done, it just
wont be as fast as the crazy arrows

> Finally, how practical is it to solo with a ranger?

very practical

you can snare and run around plunking your mob with arrows

if it's an animal, you can snare, fear, and melee it (swords, staves, feet,
pointy-nose-of-lying-death)

you can't tank, so don't......and you'll be fine

BTW

rangers can cast better than druids can melee, and bards are amazing but a
class all by itself, and it takes a while to learn them
