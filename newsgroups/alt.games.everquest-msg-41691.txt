Aside from the moaning about the loot code, and now that SB has been out a
little while, what is everyone's opinion of the zones?

Personally, I like them both, SB has a little too much wandering aggro, but
it's not as bad as I had heard.
I've been hunting the warrens and Stonebrunt on my druid, got levels 15 to
almost 18 there ( with about half of 16 being in Lavastorm after taking a
break to trade in EC ) and my warrior friend who I've been partnered with
most of the time has gone from 16 to 18 in the same time, and we've both
made about 100-150pp each, splitting the profits from bronze weapons and
whatever else goes to vendors, which doesn't even take into account the rare
loot that we've gotten.

The loot is awesome for the level, bronze weps fairly common, and I've got 5
stacks of kobold meat to bake up eventually.  Also, the rare drops off named
things in the Warrens are kinda nice too, I've gotten a Ball Peen Hammer for
my druids range slot, and just last night, I FINALLY got the Packmaster to
spawn and got Filth Covered Boots, they're awesome, as well as pit fighter
hand/foot wraps for the lower level monks who hunt there, and I've gotten
almost a stack of BBQ erudite off of the Foodmaster.  Now I just want to get
high enough to do The Muglwump, I want that shield with charges of Rune.

Also, it seems to me that the leopards, maybe all cats, in Stonebrunt DON'T
DROP RUINED PELTS!!! Makes my druids aspiring tailoring a WHOLE lot easier,
I've gotten a stack of LQ and MQ cat pelts in about 20-30 cat kills
(leopards and leopardesses, tigers and those are still bloody red).  Now all
I have to do is take up smithing to make studs.... Uggh, metal bits... I
hate metal bits.

Downside is that the trains run on time and regular, I've caused a lot, but
especially on the warrens to SB side, its because my camo drops smack in the
middle of the throne room, so my SoWed up wood elf ass just keeps running,
and picking up umpteen bazillion other kobolds.  (worst thing is when a
troll and barbarian are sitting at the SB zone line, AAAHHH ROADBLOCK!!!
MOVE!!!, or pincer training, theres a train on both sides of the zone line,
then I just zone back the way I really want to go and reset my comp since
you don't come out if you go LD while zoning.)  Also, due to the craptastic
quality of my computer, Stonebrunt performs a video card meltdown
semi-regularly if I don't keep clip-plane low in the entry valley, I don't
have any issues up towards Kejek.

And for the more aesthetic, check out the waterfall in Stonebrunt,
beautiful, as is the vast majority of the zone, the highland kobolds, and
the unique things and all the BIG animals like gorillas and pandas.

And last, but not least, Quests;  I haven't done any except kobold molars in
Erudin, but the new Stonebrunt quests look nice, especially the shadow
armour ones, the weapon ones aren't extremely powerful, but they're still
kinda nice to get, if a bit heavy.
