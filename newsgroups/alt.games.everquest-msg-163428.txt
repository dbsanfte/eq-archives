The thread on Morning Dew made me think about this; what foraged
only items are droppable and stackable and valuable, and what can
people hunt in the zones where they drop at various levels?

Morning Dew drops in Gfay and LFay.  GFay houses very low level
mobs, but it strikes me that at a level low enough to exp on
them, your forage skill is so low that you won't make "real
money" foraging.  Does anyone ever hunt all the Woodies up in
town?  Not the guards, this is one place where the newbies really
depend on those guards, I mean the hundreds of non trader guys up
in the treetops?  I can't think of one person who's ever been
saved by any of the guards up there (I imagine they help on a PvP
teams server) so hunting them wouldnt be a detriment to anyone.

LFay, especially revamped LFay, I know very little about, its
always been somewhere to get thru, to me, other than a day spent
helping a druid friend get her corrupted brownie.  How annoying
is it that brownie scouts don't drop brownie parts, by the way?

My bard (my foraging alt) is now 42, hunting the tigeraptors in
WW.  I foraged a worm egg or dragon egg I suspect is valuable,
other than that, not much.

My cleric got help doing his Shroud of the Dar Brood quest handin
from a druid in WW who was there strictly for foraging eggs...
she was only 52, perhaps too low to hunt anything there
effectively, though.

At any rate, I haven't really seen much discussion of this
combination; valuable forages in exp zones, by level.
