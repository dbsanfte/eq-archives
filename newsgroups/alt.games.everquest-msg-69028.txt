    Here in Canada, the most right-wing party (Reform) was trying to get the
second most right-wing party (Progressive Conservatives) to merge with them,
so they could become an unified alternative to the ruling Liberals. So
Reform disbanded and became a new party, designed to bring the PCs in. The
name was revealed to be, with much fanfare.....

Conservative Reform Alliance Party.

    After the media had a field day with them, they had an emergency meeting
and shortened the name to the Alliance party. 8)
