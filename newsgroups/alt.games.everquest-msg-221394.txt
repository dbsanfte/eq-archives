I'm getting an altered version when I load that page; it looks like
one of those generic "cannot find server" "click the refresh button to
try again" page but it's different.  It has the "I do not want to
display this page" at the top but the text after that is different
with some other funny stuff.  (go check it out yourself at
http://www.eqdiva.com )

http://www.dotnetdiva.com/Default.aspx works, though.
