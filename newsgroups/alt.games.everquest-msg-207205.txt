warriors can crit just fine with thrown weaps . . crips with throwing
boulders get to around 500 damage (this was before luclin)

large race only, and boulders only drop off fg's and ig's, but hell, it's
fun

 there was a bug for about 2 days .  .. like 2 years ago. .. that made every
thrown attack from a warrior become a crit

it was the coolest thing in the history of eq...except for that monk who
solo'd naggy + vox
