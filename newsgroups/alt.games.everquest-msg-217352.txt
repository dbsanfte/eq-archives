Rains are odd.  They are very useful in specific situations.

First the particulars of rains.
Max 3 waves, Max 4 hits total.

So, if there is one target in the ae you get 3 waves of 1 hit each
if there are 2 targets in the ae you get 2 waves of 2 hits each
if there are 3 targets in the ae you get 1 wave of 3 and 1 of 1
if there are 4 targets you get 1 wave of 4 hits.

Second, rains have a built in secondary resist of around 20% (according
to tests run by the folks at The Magician's Tower and Graffe's)

Third, rains generate less aggro than a nuke of equivalent size.

Fourth, damage foci do not affect rains.

Now, let's look at a 65 mage specialized in conjuration (the best post
60 nukes for mages are conjuration, rains are evocation).

Black Steel - 360 mana, 1400 dam - conjuration (MR)
Sun Vortex - 395 mana, 1550 dam - conjuration (FR)

Sun Storm - 440 mana, 800 dam per wave - evocation (FR)
Maelstrom of Thunder 480 mana, 900 dam per wave - evocation (MR)

now, my savings on Conjuration nukes is:
10% (spec conj) + 10% (SCM3) + 5% (avg for Focus of Solusek) or 25%
my savings for evoc nukes is
2.5% (50 spec) + 10% (scm3) + 5% (avg for Focus of Solusek) or 17.5%

My average damage for DD's is 1.1 x base (summoned focus bracer -
20% max increase, 10% avg)
Black Steel - 1540 avg dam (5.7:1 ratio)
Sun Vortex - 1705 avg dam  (5.75:1 ratio)

On a single target my average damage for the rains is
3xdam*.8 (for the 20% resist)
Sun Storm = 2400 * .8 = 1920 (5.3:1 ratio)
Maelstrom = 2700 * .8 = 2160 (5.45:1 ratio)

On 2 or more targets (a harder thing to accomplish) it's 4x dam * .8
Sun Storm = 3200 * .8 = 2560 (7:1 ratio)
Maelstrom = 3600 * .8 = 2880 (7.3:1 ratio)

So - most xp groups I use my DD's for their superior ratio and ease
of use (ever get summoned into your own rain?  OUCH)

Boss mobs I chain rains (mana efficiency doesn't matter - 
max DPS with minimum aggro does)

Situations where I'm loading all 4 and we get an add that is
off tanked (so both mobs being tanked) I use the rains.

If you're a wizard or druid and soloing - then they aren't worth
much because mobs can move out from under the rain.
