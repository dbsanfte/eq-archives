That does sound sweet but I didn't really want to cram another monitor on my 
desk as the one I have is a 19" NEC monster that takes up a lot of room. But 
in the Fall my daughter will be off to college with a laptop and she has a 
very nice MAG 15" LCD monitor, so maybe I will squeeze that baby onto my 
desk and do it then.
