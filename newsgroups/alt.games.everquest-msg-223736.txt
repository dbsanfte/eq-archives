I think other people have probably already mentioned this, but SoE
should realize that a number of their customers have limited playing
time.  Maybe they actually would like to group, but can only play for
an hour at a time, and they don't want to commit themselves to a group
when they can only play for a short time so they would rather just
solo for that hour and not inconvenience anyone else by having to bail
out of the group.

That's another thing too with people who don't have much playing time;
maybe you luck out and find a group with some great players and try to
make it a point to group regularly with them, but then you can't play
as much as those other people.  Then because those players have more
time to play, they eventually become too high of a level to group with
you any more, so you're back to taking your chances with pick-up
groups.
