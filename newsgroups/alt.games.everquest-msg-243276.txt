I don't believe the"reset" button ever undid changes that were already made,
just changes from the current session.  For example, if I have a red tunic,
and I bring up the dye window and make it blue, but hit the reset button, it
will go back to being red.  However, if I dye my tunic blue, accept the
change (or actually use the dye pack), close the dye window, and then come
back and try to reset it, it won't.  It only resets things to how they were
when the dye window was most recently opened (did that make any sense?)

However, to remove a previous dye color, I believe if you dye that slot
white (255, 255, 255), it will effectively remove the dye effects.... of
course, it will cost you another vial of dye...
