Seems to proc (75 HPs) about the same as the REIF it replaced.  I
like the proc, I like the stats and I like the look of it - one of my
better purchases lately.  While doing my Stoicism (great spell, if
you're unlikely or way too low to get Torpor definitely go for it)
quest I was straight up tanking slowed dark blues with no HP loss at
all between spell regen, item regen, racial regen and the
Soulstripper proc.

Makes it very easy to Canni while tanking the mob as dogdog and the
DoTs eat away at it until you've dropped a bub or so then resume
attacking to heal up fully.
