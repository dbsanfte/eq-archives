Har!  My baby ranger got stuck in that box once.  I discovered, much to my 
dismay, that I -couldn't- nuke myself to death.  A full mana bar of nukes 
only took me to about 60%, and when I sat to med up I got back to full 
health long before my mana recovered.  I can't remember how I finally got 
out, maybe the petition was finally answered, but I remember the solution 
having been cleverer than that.  I do remember running all over with my 
wizard on a second box, trying to get her stuck in there (no luck) and 
trying to target the ranger to group through the zone geometry with the 
'eye of zomm into the wall' trick, but no dice.  Not that he probably 
would have been in port range, anyway. :)
