The problem is that different people have a different interpretation of the
word.  For some, it should be spelled with only four letters.  Others just
consider it a condition of having better equipment than a player could
normally get for themselves, however received, and perceive no negative
conotation (sp???) to it.

While there seems to be something "dirty" to artificially raising your
players equipment with gear from "retired" characters, getting donations
from other players who are generous is just part of the game.  Perhaps there
should be separate terms for each, so a player who is self-twinked is
twinked, but a player who received honest gifts within the scope of the game
is equipment buffed (for want of a better term).  Twink, as I see it,
implies artificial means of acquiring goods, but there is nothing artificial
about giving a gift.  Happens all the time in real life.

Cheers,
Eric
