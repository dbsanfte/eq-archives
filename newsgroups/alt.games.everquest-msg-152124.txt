There seems to be a bug, introduced fairly recently.  I've done the
following:

1. Stand up from medding.

2. Target myself.

3. Cast levitate on myself.

There is no chance that I'm moving during that.  Yet, I occasionally get an
interrupt.  I asked in guild chat, and some others have seen interrupts in
situations where there should have been no chance of them.

However, I don't think that is what you are hitting, at least with your
DOTs.  Just stopping and waiting is not the most reliable way to make sure
you are really stopped, as far as the server is concerned.  The best way, in
turns of reliability and speed, is to stop, and then *turn* a little.  If
you do that, you can cast much quicker.  E.g., I routinely run, let go of
the "move forward" key, tap the "turn right" or "turn left" key, and start
casting, and almost never get an interrupt, even in high lag situations.
