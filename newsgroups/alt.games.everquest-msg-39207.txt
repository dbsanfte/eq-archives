I am, and he does, I'll check that out as well.

One thing that I do know about SoW/JBoots and swimming is that
when you've got a "quickfeet" buff, you can swim backwards (albeit
very slowly), whereas if you're unbuffed, you can't move
backwards at all in the water.  That's pretty handy during
underwater fights, where you can sometimes drift too close
to a mob and get "you can't see your target" -- with SoW/JBoots,
you can just slide backwards a bit to get into better position,
but you without them you have to swim farther forward and then
turn back around to regain proper melee distance.
