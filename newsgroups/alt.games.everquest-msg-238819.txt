Our group is in about the same situation that you're talking about,
not really enough gear to consistently handle multiple pulls on a Hard
since we usually only have 1 tank. Monk pulling hasn't worked all that
well for us, just takes too long to split when you have to try for
singles (or doubles at most). An SK who's snare pulling seems to make
for faster pulls. A bard pulling makes them almost trivial but due to
time-zone differences I don't get to group with that bard very often
these days. Once monk lull gets fixed, doing hards with a monk puller
should become a lot easier for us. 

Tak can be pain sometimes. We did a normal last night where we had
around a half-dozen pulls of 5 or more.  That kind of a lay-out on
hard would've been scary. 

Rgds, Frank
