Of course, for several months 100% AA was bugged, and you would gain AA
slower than a 90 / 10 split...   but forget that!  Splitting is stupid!

Pffft... do what you enjoy.   If you're looking for power, for almost all
classes Real exp beats AA until you hit 60.  After 60 it becomes a toss up,
IMO.

Going 50/50 in 61 at the moment. ; )  It seems to have the right mix of
occasional rewards (Hey, I have enough AA to buy increased triple attack...)
and true power (Hmm, if I get 62 I may have a couple hundred more hp fully
buffed) to keep me interested and having fun.
