I've been through it probably 20 times (Enchanters were in high demand for it
when GoD was new, 65 was the cap, and my peer group was partly-elemental
equipped).  I <3 my pooka.

Probably, but I don't know where.  It was trial-and-error for us the first few
times, then became fairly well known by word of mouth.  I'm sure someone's
written it up - google probably is your best bet.

>correctly)?

Nope.  Have 2 (maybe 3 - not sure) people go invis and go in.  All the ghosts
pop but don't see, so go back to the group and have your puller bring one at
a time through normal prox aggro pulling techniques.

Nothing wrong with that group per se.  The end mob is mean, and the
warrior should save his disciplines for it.  Your cleric will need to use
fast heals, and the shaman probably will need to spot.  

You will know fairly soon if your group is underpowered.  If you're struggling
with clearing normal mobs quickly, you're not going to win the end fight.
