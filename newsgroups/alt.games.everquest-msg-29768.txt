Ah, but you're talking about a druid.  I was discussing *groups* of regular
players. I don't think any of those rules apply when you throw druids and
necros into the mix. However, for well formed groups of the classes you need
to set up smooth running groups, either above ground or in dungeons, then I
believe the conventional wisdom is that these are the best xp generating
groups.
