There was a time when I did argue strongly against M$ Windows. But I'm a
bit more mature(i hope so atleast :P) and everytime I get asked whether
one should try Linux or Windows I'll ask what they want to do with it in
return. If someone wants Office and the general Windows Feeling then
stick with M$.

I'm no friend of KDE and even GNOME desktop isn't the thing I like. So I
ended up with a completely self made linux(though the Linux from Scratch
website gave me alot of help). They GUI I installed is made of a few
little tools that provide a good interface to the shell. After all there
aren't much areas where a mouse driven interface is superiour to the
console. 

This machine acts as file/print server, firewall etc. On my desktop
system I still use windows though mainly for games. Every serious work I
do I'll do on the console on the server. This is due to my
disappointment with graphical uis. Though I don't use an office package.
TeX is more then adequate to my needs.

With Cedega I might try to install a linux system on my desktop. After
all if EQ is running fine - no need for windows for me. :)

I'm really interested in the result.
