I've been lurking on the newsgroup for quite some time now and thought
I'd throw out a question of my own for a change. Two years ago, right
before the GoD expansion I cancelled my EQ account because of time
constraints. Recently I've thought about returning but I'm pretty sure
that I'd feel clueless in the beginning because of all the changes that
have occurred since my departure. If someone could sum up the changes
and then offer their opinions on them it would be a great help. My main
was a lvl 64 enchanter; how have the changes since then affected
enchanters specifically? Also, my old server (Veeshan) was merged; can
I choose a new server (via /movelog) if I reactivate my account or do I
have to play on the Luclin server? Also, recently I've been spending
some time going through older messages from this newsgroup in order to
refamiliarize myself with EQ and noticed that traffic has dropped
sharply over the past year or so. Do most players post messages
elsewhere or is this because the game's popularity in general has
declined?

Thanks for any tips/advice you can offer!
