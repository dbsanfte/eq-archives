Can't say I have noticed more than a couple of Japanese players but I guess
that depends on the server.
As for the World knowing who he was, I don't think he is well known as you
think. This game might be loaded with Japanese players but it is more loaded
with kids who's closest contact with Kurosawa would have been watching Last
Man Standing on Video.
Really, is he that well known in the states? If I mentioned his name here
I'd have to be very selective who I asked to get more than a blank look.
