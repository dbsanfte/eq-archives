The down side is that Vah Shir can't worship any god at all, as far as 
game mechanics are concerned.  Nothing to keep you from pursuing the 
various "dark side" factions, mind you, but you won't end up being able 
to wear Bertox only goodies or anything like that.

I dont' think there's a down side to Veeshan worship for any race, 
perhaps you wont' be able to get good faction in KD no matter what you 
do?  I've not heard that but its possible, some religions make some 
factions impossible to fix, or so I've heard.

In general, religion matters little from a game mechanics standpoint, 
for a good roleplayer its fodder for lots of fun, but there's nothing to 
prevent you insisting your bard worships Bertox if you like even though 
he's Vah Shir.
