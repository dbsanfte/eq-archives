If you use the exploit over and over before reporting it, you risk getting
banned.  I've heard of folks getting in trouble for doing it to *demonstrate*
for the GM's, too, though if they did, that's bullshit.

If you really want to test it to see if you really DID just accidentally dupe
something--dupe 5 copper ONCE before you report it, not 500 plat; dupe a rusty,
not a Yak.  At least then you can show you weren't trying to gain something in
the process.
