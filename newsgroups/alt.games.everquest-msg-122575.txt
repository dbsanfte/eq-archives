I have a 54 gnome mage... great race/class combo and slightly higher
intelligence then high elf to start out with.

Yes.. the new race with the SoL expansion.. the Vah Shir (big
kitties), they non evil and have night vision, safefall and sneak as a
racial abilitiy.

Yes new class... Beastlord, they are a hybrid like rangers, paladins
and shadowknights.
They get a warder (ie.. a pet) at level 9, and to summon pet doesn't
require any mana as its a ability and not a spell.
Beastlord's pets will travel across zones with them.. so you don't
have to keep resummoning pets once you cross a zone.
They are a excellant class to solo with. 
Barbarians, Ogres, Trolls, Iksar and Vah Shir can be beastlords.
Each race gets a different type or warder.
Barbarians get wolve warders
Ogres get bear warders
Trolls get alligator warders
Iksar get scalewolf warders... hehe, look like big green armadillos
and Vah Shir get tiger warders
I have a 41 Vah Shir warder and other then a true evil city, I haven't
found too many cities I couldn't go to.
