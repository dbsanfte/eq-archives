First, are you sure you will want to go to LOIO?  Once, it had a very high
XP modifier, but they've cut it, so it's not a spectacular XP zone any more,
and not many people are there, so getting a group could be hard.

If you will really want to go there, I *think* you can do the tunnels OK,
even without invis.  The route is pretty easy (just followed the left hand
rule for traversing a maze, both before and after zoning).  You'll have SoW,
so just outrun anything that aggros.

However, some of the mobs in the tunnels might be shaman...I don't
recall...and so this might be a horrible suggestion.  (Although, caster mobs
tend to stop and cast, so you can probably run away from them).

As others have said, though, going through FM is probably the best route.
