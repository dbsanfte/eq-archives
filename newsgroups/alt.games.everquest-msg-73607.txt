I dont have a horse, but keeping them in the bank for a corpse run
wouldnt make sense I wouldnt think as I seem to recall that your whip
(isnt that what they chose to call your horse) is soul bound so if you
die you simply call your horse.  I know that is how they WERE going to
do it.  Not sure if it actually made it that way.
