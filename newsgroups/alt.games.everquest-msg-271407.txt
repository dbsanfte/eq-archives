The Peat Bog seems to be pretty good for that ... just run around 
harvesting/mining/gathering etc. and you'll start seeing the traps. It's 
usually not too busy in there from what I've seen ... you need to get your 
skill upto 20 before you can start on the tier2 stuff iirc ... used to be 40 
before they dropped it in one of the patches.
