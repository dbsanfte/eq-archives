   Really?  People are really trying to shut it down?  I know of course that the
media seems to love putting out features that describe how EQ is ruining lives,
but is anyone really trying to pull the plug?  I mean I thought that even Mrs.
Woolley was trying to shake SOE down for money, and start up a help group for
those who are addicted.  AFAIK, there isn't even a Chick track that deals with
the evils of Everquest.

    I'm just mildly curious about this, not rabidly flaming.
