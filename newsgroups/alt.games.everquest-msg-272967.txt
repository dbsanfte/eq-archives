No, that's a distinction *you've* been making. The general claim here is 
that no one is ever jailed without having been accused of or considered 
suspect regarding the breaking of a law. No arrest ever goes on the books 
as "just because I felt like it".

The thing is, that's not *all* you said. It's your claim that a person 
should be put in jail for banning someone from their website that people 
are arguing.

Therefore, you tell us, if you agree that the board owner and admins were 
well within their rights to do so, how is it that they deserve jail time 
for doing so? Even if you don't agree with them on an ethical basis, their 
actions were hardly worthy of incarceration.
