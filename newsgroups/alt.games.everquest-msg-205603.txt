: Does this skill just take that much work? I had to quit because my

Get your wisdom up a little (over 100) and you will see the skillups move a
bit faster.  But, yeah, it's slow.  You're a fighter and your Wis/Int are
not going to be all that high to help your skill-ups.  Also, don't try to
work on items thatr are too far over your current skill.  Just work on the
next trivial level of arrow.  Don't stretch it...too many failures and, in
my experience, slower skill ups.
