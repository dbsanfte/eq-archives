With regards to the specific pathing problem I'm speaking of, there is no
'grey area'.  You swim mobs to a certain spot and they simply stop moving.
Imagine if you could go to Maiden's Eye and round up a bunch of Gorangas,
Coterie..whatever.. and run them to a spot where they just froze in place to
be killed by 1 or 2 AE'ing wizards.

The only difference I can find is that since ME is a *very* utilized zone
vs. SG which is pretty much empty all the time, one zone would get fixed
while one has been broken since Velious was released.
