I got a snicker from a GM posing as a named tizmak the other night.
Several named tizmaks were running around in GD, claiming to seek
revenge for their kin. I asked how they could know who to take their
revenge out on then commented that ok, perhaps it was a clue if the
players were attacking them, and the tizmak snickered softly at me ;)
