Find someone with 300 Alchemy or Poisonmaking, and the best tradeskill 
enhancement item for that skill (probably alchemy, with the pouch off the 
alchemist in Grieg's End), make sure they have Salvage 3 and alchemy or 
poison master 3.  Do the same for the blacksmithing part, 300 smithing, +
15% mod item, and salvage 3 and smithing mastery 3, and the same for the 
JC part, 300 JC, +5% (I don't know of better) item, and salvage 3 and JC 
mastery 3.

That will give you the best chance at success.  The odds are still not 
great with that many combines at high levels, depending on what is 
returned by a failure.  For the final combine, I know the gem is not 
normally returned, having failed a lower level one for someone.
