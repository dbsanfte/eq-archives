Nawww, they'll release it this year... finished or not (Im betting on
the or not part). With WoW being a major player, they wont sit on EQ2
for long. Oh, they'll spew all the rhetoric about not releasing till
its done, but it will be on the shelf not much longer after WoW is.
The marketing boys wont let them hold it off till 2005.
