Merchants are by default no worse than glower dubious, unless you
lower that faction (usually by kills)

This can trip you up as it did me when I went into skyshrine, dropped
invis somewhere safe and conned an npc. "Oh!" I thought, "I am glower
dubious to skyshrine!" As I turned the corner though I had a large
train as I realized that no, I was scowl but merchants start out at
glower dubious unless you've taken a murder hit ( I had never killed
any skyshrine COV faction things or outdoor dragons in velious at that
point)

So unless you've taken hits to a faction, you don't have to worry
about merchants.

Scowling and threaten is kos, both will get you attacked but threaten
is less aggro sort of.. which means you are still just as dead.
