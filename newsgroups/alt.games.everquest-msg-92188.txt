Okay, I take some offense to that statement. =P As someone with a lvl 53
druid main (don't ask about my alts - they are shamelessly twinked =P),
I don't hold a weapon - haven't for some levels - and I am most
definitely not a twink. I wore nothing but non magical leather armor and
never even saw a magic item drop until I was 20 or so. IMO, any druid
over 20 should probably try to lose the weapon and get something better
for everyday use, like a paw which can be quested in your mid thirties
and the testament (no drop book, so it's more difficult to twink with it
/evil grin) which can be quested in your mid twenties, or perhaps even
low twenties. Both are much better stats than any weapon out there for
the hand slot (9wis and other stats on the paw, 10wis 10mana on the
testament) and it's not like you're going to be able to melee worth crap
much after 20 anyway, *especially* if you aren't heavily twinked. I
started noticing I was really taking a beating in melee wearing non-uber
armor somewhere around 21-22ish, if I recall correctly.

That said, it comes in handy from time to time to have something to
finish a mob with when you're low or oom, so you'll probably want to
keep a weapon in your inventory somewhere. I'd have to agree that 1HB is
the way to go for everyday use if this is your first character. It's
much easier to find a decent but inexpensive 1HB than 1HS and you
*definitely* won't be doing much melee by the time you have an epic,
other than to whack at a fleeing mob perhaps, or maybe kill the odd
green that aggros while your medding. Pick up a combine or velium scimmy
or icepaw war claws, and use it occasionally if you just want to try to
keep 1HS up so you'll actually be able to hit something when you get
your epic. You might even want to do the same with 2HB, just in case you
get lucky on a Naggy raid or something similar late in life. But use the
1HB as your "everyday" weapon. =)

FWIW, I currently equip a cone of the mystics and paw of oppolla
(although I hope to be dropping this for the epic real soon) for
everyday use, and keep in my backpack a heirophant's staff (2HB) for
occasionally whacking stuff and icepaw war claws (1HS) and a jagged
shard of bone (druid usable piercer, or all things) for wearing into
newbie zones so I can disguise myself as a rogue or a ranger. /grins
