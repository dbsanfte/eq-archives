I guess you are terribly unfamiliar with usenet. Nothing is
"obviously" a shild's post, nor is it ever possible to seperate 
who is an adult from who is a child.

Adults now graduate from high school with a total inability to
communicate in a written form at all and a lot of them in college may
not be as mature as your 13 year old. 

Here are some good rules of thumb for usenet:

No one is as they seem.
There is no age, sex, country of origin or race.
Nothing is assumed.
