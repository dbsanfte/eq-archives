I don't want a beggars be gone.. I want a "leave me the hell alone u
incompetent person/group" be gone..

I was doing HoT (Halls of Testing-Temple of Veeshan) last night.. a small 1
and a half group thing that was going really well.  No gating mobs, no
deaths, pretty good for several hours.

Then, gimp_guild_rep tells you, "Where in HoT are you?  We are coming too.."
You tell gimp_guild_rep, "I have bad experienced of multiple groups in
HoT..."
gimp_guild_rep tells you, "It will be safe.. I've done it before.. here we
come"
You tell gimp_guild_rep, "We are not comfortable or happy sharing in a place
li.."  thats as much as I'd typed, before 5 level66+ uncharmable and
unmezzable mobs came steaming at us
