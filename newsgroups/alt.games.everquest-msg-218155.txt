You continue to miss the point.

I have no objection to the statement that bad genetics is 'attributable' 
to the parents. My objection is to the statement that bad genetics is 
the parents 'fault'.

They are not the same thing. Suppose I have a car crash. It is entirely 
  true that the accident is attributable to my being in my car at that 
particular place in time. However that doesn't make the crash my fault.

Fault implies that an error in judgement has been made. It is entirely 
possible to make an appropriate judgement and still have things go awry. 
The result is attributable to your judgment, but there is no fault in 
your judgment.

Every time you get into a car there is a risk that you won't survive the 
trip. The mere act of choosing to get into a car doesn't automatically 
make it your fault if you don't survive.
