I haven't personally run EQ on a laptop, but I have done extensive
research in preparation to purchasing a laptop that will run EQ.

Right now the video to have is the Nvidia GeForc 2 Go with 32mb of DDR
memory.

The best cards for gaming on a laptop (and there are only a couple out
there) ranked from first to last....

Nvidia GeForce2 Go 32mb DDR
Nvidia GeForce2 Go 16mb DDR
ATI Mobility M4 32mb
ATI Mobility M4 16mb

A fully loaded dell Inspirion 8000 (with the Nvidia 32DDR card) will
run you about 3000.00$

Cheers
