I guess I missed the part about multiple people using an account. My boys
shared one for a log time. They now have their own since they want to be on
at the same time.  Transfering wasn't even available back then but my
youngest didn't have a problem starting over. His brother gave him his old
equipment so he only needed to regain experience.  I know several families
that share accounts, how would Verant ever know?
