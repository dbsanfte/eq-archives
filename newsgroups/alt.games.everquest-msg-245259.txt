But then, how do you deal with the case where the 5 rangers in the guild
agreed beforehand on the order of who got the bow and bid minimum
points, knowing no one else would be allowed to bid on it? Let them do
it then kick all the rangers out? This happened in my previous guild,
mainly with rogues and monks. AoW pants going for 5 pts rankles the
classes that can't make those kinds of sweetheart deals for items they
want, especially when it allows those classes to save those points to
grab those 100+hp all/all items many classes covet.
