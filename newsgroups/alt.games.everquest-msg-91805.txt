There is some new uber armor, some off of not too insane mobs in
umbral planes. The Elysian armor for druids there is darn good. The
bp, which was higher AC at one time but was "fixed", is now something
that rivals the TOV or thurg velious quest bp. It has pretty near
similar stats like wis and hp and such BUT it has plus 8 to some
resses in addition. SO really in some ways its BETTER possibly except
that it hasn't got the group regrow right click. What I thought about
doing, though, was if I got the elysian bp like I want to.. go ahead
and then use the 3 black marbles I have to get the thurg bp instead of
going for a tov one. I could then just toss on the thurg one for the
group regrow, then switch back.

There is some pretty darn nifty stuff. We have killed rumblecrush in
umbral a couple times and he is a fun mob. Mobs like him are fun
because they are fairly rare I think but many guilds are just not
gunning for him yet. We've added him to our list due to some okay
stuff he can drop like a 45 ac wis/hp etc bp which a cleric in our
guild was happy to get (for clerics its different but better in some
ways than their tov bp) The person who got it knew that a stipulation
of getting it would be they'd not roll on the TOV bp drop, but they
were more than happy to agree since its a good bp, fairly compareable
and of course they had far more of a chance to get it than they would
competing for a tov one with several classes.

Mobs like him are great in Luclin because if you get on and other
guilds are rushing for vindi/statue whatever you can go and scope it
out and jump rumblecrush. The more mobs like that which are around
with semi god-like loot, the more spread out guilds can be and the
less competition or crying there is.

Most of the stuff I'm seeing in Luclin though is not super fantastic
and possibly in line for a nerf, its just darn nice stuff. Besides the
loot the mobs are FUN (especially the first time) we had no idea if we
could kill rumble and then died a couple times due to strategy gone
wrong, finally got him alone, used our typical cazic/vindi/whatever MT
tank with CH cleric chain and druids and whomever else spamming heal
the MT also, while our big gun wizards used which ever spell one of
them found to hit the most on him. We've found that once the Master
Tank has fully aquired aggro and with the CH chain and spam healing he
is staying alive, the fight is more or less won for us. I know some of
this stuff is old hat for other guilds, but we are still learning and
everytime we do this and it works out TOTALL RIGHT, we have a group
orgasm basically.

It just really brings some more excitement, content and room to do
things as a guild, while getting some new and different pretty good
loot (Luclin does.)
