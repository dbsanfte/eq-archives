And that is the crux of the democratic claim. That a machine that does
nothing but count holes in pieces of paper managed to not just once but
twice count up all the holes and attribute more holes to bush than to gore ,
and that said machine obviously knew who the republican was and cheated for
him . The machines where selected , run , and managed by democrats btw.

After you swallow the prior bit you get to swallow that democrats not liking
the result made the claim that democrats and only democrats could by hand
count better than the machine.

Then you have to do some real dodging on the absentee ballots . You have to
manage to throw out all the military ballots since our military sensibly
does not vote for democrats since pointy head liberals hate soldiers. They
have to vote absentee because clinton removed the voting places that used to
be on military bases because our armed forces could not be trusted with
anything as important as running voting booths on base. (worked too , lots
fewer military vote these days), then you have to scream rant and rave that
blacks where denied there right to vote and do so loudly enough that no one
notices what you are doing , the media will never mention that you cannot
find even just one person denied his right to legally vote.

We are getting there now ! almost done ! You have to hand count votes in
just heavily democratic areas. You do this and all your nice democratic
ladies can conveinently punch out the tabs that accidently got left on
democratic sheets , while very carefully handling icky republican sheets.
You do this outside the watchfull eye of independent observers and all the
people doing this are democrats. But democrats surely wouldnt add a ballot
or two or find 600 or so stuffed behind a pew at a church.

The only way it was ever counted as a gore win was when ALL of these methods
where used AND all the military votes where thrown out. In no way was that
counting method evenhanded , or even sane.

The supreme court decree was that if you where going to hand count votes
then you must hand count all of the votes in Florida in exactly the same
way, and that you could not deprive the military of the right to vote just
because you didnt like the way they voted.

Machine count 1 bush
machine count 2bush (done less than a day later)
recount done by the times bush ( done monthes after the fiasco )
