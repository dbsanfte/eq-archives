On my keyboard, when my fingers are hovering over the tilde, 1, 2, 3 
keys, my thumb is right over the ALT key.  Mind you, I do not suffer from 
significant carpal tunnel problems, so I find it quite easy to just use 
ALT-# to cast spells.

I use the mouse as little as possible, I do not use it for moving, I only 
use it for targetting in areas with lots of mobs, where I am trying to 
slow multiple mobs.
