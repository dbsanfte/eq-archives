Well, Val is 50 by now, and maybe 51, and with the new guild he just 
joined, he'll be experiencing that fairly soon.  (I've exp'd and been 
guilded with his GM, she's a druid who isn't afraid of any dungeon I've 
seen.)
Of course I know a TON more about other classes than I did at 50.  To the 
point where I almost know which new buffs stack and which overwrite 
similar buffs.  In fact I would say I know more about other classes now 
than I really knew about bards at 50.
