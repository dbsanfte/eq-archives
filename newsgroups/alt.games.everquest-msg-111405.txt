A lot of weapons derived from farm implements, and not just because, well,
thats all the peasants had to fight with, but also because typically under
oppressive regimes/conquerers the first thing banned is martial training and
weapons in the local populace. Agricultural implements of course are needed
for the peasants to be productive. That was the loophole used universally,
not just in Japan either.

For example - the widespread Germanic predisposition for mastering
(seemingly) unweildy axes I recall dates back to Roman occupation and the
outlawing of swords in the native population. Axes were an agricultural
implements, widespread and legal at the time. Next thing you know there is a
large pool of skilled axefighters and even axethrowers.

I would imagine a Roman Legionairre examining an thrown axe embedded in his
chest would have had his own opinions about how effective weapon
restrictions were, as also a mainland Japanese soldier must have thought on
the receiving endend of an Okinawan numchaka (based on the grain flail?).
