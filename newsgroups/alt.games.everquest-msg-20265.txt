It's not Druid only, it will give mana to any caster.

As far as I know, train 1 point in the skill at your guildmaster and put a
weapon in each hand.  It'll go off automatically I think.  If not, you'll
have to make a combat button for it.

It depends.  It'll let you do a lot more damage, but you'll lose some AC. 
Dual Wield has a lot higher damage potential than Bash though (and I'm not
sure Rangers get Bash anyway.)  Plus, a weapon in your left hand can still
proc, so you could have a Polished Granite Tomahawk in one hand and, say, a
Vellium Longsword in the other, and get both procs every now and then. 
(Yes, I know it's not an "ideal" weapon combination.  I just don't know of
many proc'ing melee weapons, since all of my characters are casters.)
