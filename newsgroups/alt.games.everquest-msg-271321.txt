Cool, glad I could help.    Yeah, some of the tricks of the tradeskill process
aren't really explained anywhere, except maybe a few old message board posts
if you're good at digging for the answers.   That one is a common one... I've
met several people who thought that because they were only shown 2 possible
levels of quality... that was all the recepie allowed.   That there were crude
backpacks and shaped backpacks, but nobody was able to make pristine.   Or
that they wouldn't even get the option to make pristine until they maxed out
thier skill.   When all along it was the low quality components they were
using that were to blame.

I'm not sure about your server, but on ours, Alchemists are the scrooges.
You'll find you need at least one of their chemicals, wash, resin, oil or
temper, for every single f'ing combine you do.  Creating four chemicals costs
them 6 copper for water, 6 copper for a candle, and one easy to get foraged
component...  and they then try to sell each of those chemicals for 1 silver.
About a 3300% profit margin.    They were getting away with it for a while
since there were so few alchemists to compete with them.... not sure if they
still are.  (Haven't had much time to play in the last week or two.  Getting
ready to move.)

So, Alchemist will probably be the most useful class.  Aside from supporting
your craftsman character, he'll also be able to create poisons that predators
and rogues can use in combat.  (You play a predator, right?) And fighter class
skills that you can sell to other players.

You'll still need a ton of things from other classes, like metal sheets and
spikes from blacksmith types and iron studs from jewelcrafter types... but
those people all need chemicals as well, so you could probably trade a couple
stacks of temper for a stack of sheets, etc.
