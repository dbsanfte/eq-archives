It is tempting but doing such a thing would just encourage him to try
to get back some of his horribly maimed image here. I think its better
to just let him try to forget this rapage ever occurred and just get
on with posting as if it never happened. He would be very wise to do
so, though doing the smart thing is not exactly Andrew's strong
point...


>Crap! I just said "methinks"!

Cease doing so forthwith!
