To some degree, sure.  But there are a lot of tradeskilled items
that players get from other players.  Leatherfoot Haversacks come
to mind; they're cultural tailoring, so if they were nodrop then
only halflings could ever have them.  Ouch!  And of course all
those geerloks that make tradeskilling a little easier, only gnomes
could use them, and they'd have to push tinkering up pretty high
to make them.  Similarly, only gnome bakers could make ice cream,
since they're the only ones who can make the ice cream makers.

Now, I'm not saying that making all tradeskill items nodrop -- and
hence mostly unavailable -- would break the game, but it's an
example of the sort of change that can have a large ripple effect.

And of course, as your earlier remark (which I snipped) points out,
making everything nodrop (even if you leave tradeskill items alone)
will make plat less valuable, since there's less you can do with it.
(I guess you can buy a horse.)  Which would mean there might be less
reason for people to make tradeskill items for sale anyway.

Well yeah, I wasn't suggesting that all the nodrop stuff would clog
up inventories; obviously, if you can't use it, you destroy it.  But
that means a LOT more stuff is getting destroyed, which maybe people
get used to at higher levels (as you say, "Grats Rot") but for me it
still sounds like it would be frustrating.
