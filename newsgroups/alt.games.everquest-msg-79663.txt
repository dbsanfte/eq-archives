Here's my Dyllin story:

It was almost two years ago (right around when Kunark was released) and my
druid was in his early twenties.  I have a strict "no camp" policy when it
comes to rare mobs, i.e. it bores me to tears and I can't be bothered.  So I
stopped by to see if Dyllin was up, he wasn't, so I camped for the night in
the area where he pops.

The next day, I logged in on my lunch hour to see if I got lucky.  He was
there!  So before I even said hi to my guild, I harmonied nearby NPC's (just
in case) and killed him quick.  Woohoo!  ToV is mine!  I triumphantly told
my guild about it, and was met with a couple of LOL's.  Two of my guildies
were, at that very moment, on the EK ramp on their way to check on Dyllin.
Heheh, woops.

Maybe it's because I still feel guilty, but my druid still equips the ToV at
level 49 (yeah, I'm a slow leveler, and I just didn't like the CGS).
