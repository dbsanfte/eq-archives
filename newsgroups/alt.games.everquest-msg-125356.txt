I know this is probably a cliche, but...
There are no stupid questions. (At least this one's not, I can't vouch for
the others. :P)

The best way is with a thank-you, and a desire to help somebody much in the
same way later on, when you're all Super-Uber, and you see a lower level guy
or gal in distress... do unto others. On the same page as this is if
somebody gives you a cool weapon or piece of equipment, don't sell it when
you've outgrown it - spread the happiness by giving it to a struggling new
player. That's the cool thing about Everquest - it allows the chance to be a
better person than you may be in real life. Spread the joy! Good luck!
