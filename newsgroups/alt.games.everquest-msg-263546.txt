Being a developer yourself, they can also see where a particular portion of 
a program may not be quite ready for prime time for many possible reasons, 
while the rest of the program is much further along. It was likely ready to 
deploy with the exception of a few critical bugs, or perhaps they wanted 
more concentrated feedback on other sub-systems. The late arrival of that 
one aspect of the game does not speak the volumes you claim.

Man, in spite of Lance's speaking up for you, you're making it kind of hard  
for you to be taken seriously. Many of the issues you feel so strongly 
about amount to little more than matters of personal preference. Where I 
realize that could be said of most complaints about most games, yours here 
strike me as a bit short-sighted and over-zealous - almost bitter.

I appreciate your giving us your own take on it, but it's starting to feel 
like a wet blanket. We get it. You don't like it. I still think I will. To 
each their own. /shrug
