Yet another dumb question guys

Could you explain the grouping rules?  I had gathered that you need to be
within a certain range to group and still get exp, I thought it was about 5
lvls apart, but I was in a group recently and a mage joined, 4 lvls above me
she was, but 7 above my mate and we all got exp?  The answer seems fairly
obvious, but I was wondering if any could clarify for me, seeing we got some
EQ master on here : )

Here's hoping : )

Oakas
Half Elf - Ranger

ps don't ask me how I got to 26 without knowing this stuff !    (dumb but
LUCKY lol)
