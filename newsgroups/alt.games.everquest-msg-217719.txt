Neutral on these. I simply don't group enough for it to really bother me.
Not that it wouldn't have its advantages, of course.

Slightly less than neutral. Yes, they have the capability, but at the same
time, I like the fact that the old world zones I grew up in still look the
same. It makes it more like coming home. And I don't trust that they'll be
able to make them prettier without changing the feel overall.

I'd love this. Much as I like the idea of the old world staying the same,
I wouldn't mind in the least if this changed. Even with faster zoning on
my new computer, I still hate having to go from one end of Freeport to the
other. And don't get me started on the tiny little Kaladim zones...

One thing I'd like to add that I don't think anyone has mentioned yet
(sorry if someone did and I missed it): I'd like a field in the friends
window where I can make a brief note about each person. I think there's
something like that in the guild management window, but I haven't been in
a guild since that was introduced, so I'm not sure. It would be useful for
me, since I have seven RL friends who play EQ on my server, and four of
them have used all their character slots. I hit /who all friend and get
results, sure, but that doesn't mean I know who I'm talking too,
especially when it's one of their less-used alts. It'd be nice to be able
to note for myself that so-and-so is my friend Bob's necro, or is someone
I met in-game that I had a fun time talking with, or whatever. Yes, I
could just write it down the old-fashioned way, but those pieces of paper
tend to wander off.

It seems like that wouldn't be very had to implement, but I'm no
developer...
