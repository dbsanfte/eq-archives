As I stated above it does NOT affect the Hast/Slow portion of a song.
Just check www.eqdiva.com for infos on that.

I haven't used the resistance songs until I got the AE versions at 54
and 56. Since then I use them regularly and it does help quite a bit. I
was with a few guildies (all 65) in an LDoN when an enchanter Mob charmed
our tank. I then twisted elemental chorus (with TDoK) in whenever we
encountered a caster and nobody got charmed/mezzed or nuked sucessfully
then. Sure the poison and disease based spells hit but I only have 8
spellgems. :P
The other occasion where your resistance songs are not only useful but
nearly required is when fighting dragons. My guild had done Trakanon
quite a lot lately (I got my epic 2 days ago. YAY!) and it's poison AE
is a pain when your resistances aren't that high. Sing your resistance
song with drum equipped and it bounces off. :)
So they do work! :P
