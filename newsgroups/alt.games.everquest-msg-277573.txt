Yeah, the "anti-zerg" code....

Actually it lets the designer take a variety of approaches
since they don't have to worry about a guild just throwing
more people at an encounter.    Group balance is easier
since you don't have single, over-powered classes (like
clerics with CHeal).   The bottleneck is on the players, not
the content (ie, Guild A killing Vox doesn't mean Guild B
can't, it means Guild A can't just go kill it again immediately
with the same players.)

There's certainly a content barrier (at the high-end) for the
hardcore player but it's a lot easier to address in EQ2 than
it was in EQ1.    I just don't see any mechanical barriers.
