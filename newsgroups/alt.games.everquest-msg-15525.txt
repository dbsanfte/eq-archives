How may times does it have to be explained.

It is a contraction, and because it is a contraction, it has been
abbreviated. If it has been abbreviated, it is an abbreviation. I defy you
to find a dictionary that says otherwise. An abbreviation is anything I
decide to abbreviate, how can you not see that?

Simply repeating over and over that words are only abbreviations if you deem
them to be such, is ridiculous. Find some evidence about these "rules" you
have invented about what constitutes an abbreviation and what does not.

Get thee hence to a dictionary.
