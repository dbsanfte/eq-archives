There is actually just cause for most people in poor countries to
resent the US, and it's not jealousy. There are countries that have
agricultural surpluses that are starving. There are countries that are
bankrupt that are sitting on massive natural resources. Why? Because
they don't control the wealth anymore, it's in the hands of the
multinationals, and though they aren't all American, enough of them
are, and the US, as the defender of rampant uncontrolled capitalism in
the world, is the biggest backers of them. Hello to 21st century
imperialism.

Including the current administration.

Goes both ways. The US seems to believe its the only one doing good in
the world, and its media will not acknowledge anything else.
