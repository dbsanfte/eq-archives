Yeaaaahhh, but that's over my $150 top price. :)  Meanwhile I can buy a
Gainward GF2MX400(64) for $78.  SOMEHOW I don't think that a GF3Ti200 is
worth twice the price of the MX400.  Somehow I don't think that SoL is coded
to take great advantage of its added capabilities.

PLEASE, someone correct me if I'm wrong...someone who has 2 machines with
one with the MX and one with Ti or has upgraded in the last 2 days from one
to the other.

I'm thinking I'll buy the Gainward for now and upgrade in 6 month or so,
when the price of the card you're recommending is at about $100. :)

I DO appreciate the info, btw, thanks!

(someone asked me in email before when I mentioned a card for $70 for more
info...the vendor is buyeee.com and www.pricewatch.com is listed at $68 +
$6-12 shipping...I haven't verified it yet)
