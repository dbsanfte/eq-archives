Well, I agree with you for the most part.  Although if the other person
(your necro friend, say) just casts a DoT on each mob when they were three
fourths of the way dead, that would speed quading up a hell of a lot, and
since you've got a fourth of their HP agroed away, shouldn't take agro to
much.  I've practiced this with a friend, and as long as we run close
together the ones that change their agro still goto the same place.  druid
snares and dots 4 mobs, at three fourths HP I ebolt all 4, sit down.. ebolt
will do almost just about half the damage of a blue mob by itself.  and RIPs
get JBBed to death while druid keeps the others running.  I love shaman, if
only I could snare (no, i'm a barbarian, so I can't).
