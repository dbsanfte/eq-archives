War starts tommorow, hopefully the last one for a while, but this is a just
war and it needs to be fought, most of you are "made blind, deaf and mute by
the enlightenment brought about by secular humanism".

Apparently God has chosen not to destroy France, that can only mean that
they are playing the ol' wait and see game before they act, as they always
have, actually that is how I always act as well.

The United States of America will exist until the end of time.
