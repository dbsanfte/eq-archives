Log it Kenny.  I'll be somewhat surprised if there's a noticeable
difference in proc's vs. time for the example you give.  SOE has
in the past specificly stated that proc rate is in part a function
of 1h vs. 2h.  That is, 2handers are more likely to proc on a given
swing.

See above.

You're somehow not understanding what I've posted, let's see if
repetition helps your reading comprehension:
"Your assumption, that proc rate is strictly a per swing calculation,
is however unproven as far as I know."
It may well be that Haste increases proc frequency, I've never bothered
to check for or test this because it has zero effect on my play (Haste
is good regardless).  SOE has, however, stated publicly that 2h weapons
will proc more frequently on a per swing basis than 1h.  Restating your
previous argument without addressing my objection to your unstated
assumption demonstrates nothing other than that you are capable of
working the same trivial math problem twice to get the same result.

Prove it.  Until and unless you do I'll go with SOE's public claims
and my own observations.
