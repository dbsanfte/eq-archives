So far so good.  /ignore solved your problem, right?

I also say "so what?".  There are jerks and impolite people at any large
social event.  They're easier to ignore online, which is good.  If he
threatened you or didn't leave you alone after you asked him to, then /report
him and there's a chance something'll be done. 

>I say, "Let's rate his baby X" ... let's put that out there.

I don't know what this means.
