There are several places to lose a corpse at about level 11:

It's possible to lose a corpse in Befallen.  If you go past the first
locked door and die then you will not have a key to get back in.  I
used to solo in Befallen and it almost happened to me - I just got back
through that door before dieing.  If I hadn't got through it I would
have had to kill that SK with no gear or as much gear as I could
scrounge up with the money in my bank (not a lot unless I raided
another character's bank account and that wouldn't even be available if
this was your first character).  Then, by the time I got back, chances
are that the whole top room would have repopulated too.  I forget what
level I was when that happened but the first floor is about level 8 or
10.

I also nearly lost a corpse at level 12.  I was a dark elf and went to
the Ocean of Tears to try to find my way to Kunark without using the
PoK.  I landed on the dock and wandered around a bit until I
encountered an elf who attacked me.  I ran away and foolishly jumped
into the water.  I cast gate and was interrupted a few times before
getting it off.  I fainted three or four times at my bind point before
I finally recovered.  Had that last gate not succeeded I'd have left a
corpse at the bottom of the sea which would have not been easy to get
at all (if it was possible at all without outside help)

Also, at level 12, enchanters need to get their pet spells from High
Keep which means a trip through Kithicor Forest.  That was a tough
corpse for me to get - I didn't know exactly where it was and there are
a lot of mobs there that can wipe a level 12 out in one attack (which
was what caused my death in the first place)
