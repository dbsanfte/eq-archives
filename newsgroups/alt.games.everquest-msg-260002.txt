LOL i really need to proofread...

I think the series might have been Butterflies, or something like 
that? Blond woman having an affair with a man, and IIRC they 
didnt actually have sex until a fair amount into the program, 
they used to get together and just talk. She had one or 2 sons, 
and her 'affair' started out as a way to destress by talking with 
someone who actually cared about more than dinner on the table 
and clean laundry.

Dont know about Red Dwarf, but getting british programming in teh 
US can be a bit dodgy, though PBS did a decent job of using Are 
You Being Served, Fawlty Towers, Dr Who, and a sort of rotating 
selection of odd SFish shows that they would seem to pick up in 
mid series, and show episodes out of sequence and then abruptly 
switch into doing a different series just as you were getting 
into watching it=\
