What stats for a ranger?
All depends on your playing style now and in the future.
Forget adding to strength(you get a spell for that)agility(minimal
difference to AC)and
ofcourse Int. Put your points into Stamina, at least up to 100, because at
higher levels
in longer fights when your fatigue(yellow) bar hits 0 you start hitting
less. The other stat to consider is dex, because it affects the rate at
which all melee skills increase and later will affect your critical hits
with bow.
Your playing style comes into play here. In a group you will need good AC
and hitpoints because you need to draw aggro from the casters and might end
up being the one getting pounded on.
You might also be the main aggro and puller of the group if you're a few
levels higher than the other melee. At level 50 however you get double
damage, with bow, on a MoB that is standing still but not rooted or (I
presume) snared. This means that if the warrior is standing toe-to-toe with
the mob with another char beating it as well, you can stand back an pin
cushion the mob with arrows. With haste, a wgt loss quiver, and a good bow,
such as Light Velium Bow, 30/40 you can hit for 60-80, and double that for a
crit hit. Need good dex for this.
If you solo, then it depends on your style of soloing. At level 40 I spent
some time at the dragon bridge in Eastern Wastes hunting the rygorr orcs.
Exp, pp and sometimes loot. I would harmony, snare, then root and dot, and
stand back and use about 40 arrows, get the mob to half hp then melee to
finish off. AC and HP are important and having reasonable wis for this is a
must too, though not entirely essential.
Or you can fear kite animals, much faster exp, much worse loot, mostly. If
you keep fear up constantly you need not worry about AC or HP since you
hardly get hit. you just need to pull the mob away from potential adds.
I read on a ranger forum that in the high end game, and in raids, rangers
are used mostly as archers, (you get some AA archery skills) and that Sta is
the only stat that matters. Whether this is true or not I can't say yet, I'm
only 51. Some level 60 rangers recommend dumping all points into Sta, others
say it doesn't matter. I put none into sta, base is 80, but I have 118 sta
with equipment.  I hunted wooly mammoths in Ef  for exp and cash then took
my savings to the bazaar and traded there for a few weeks. Made a lot of
money and upgraded all my gear by picking up bargains, so getting good gear
was never a problem.
