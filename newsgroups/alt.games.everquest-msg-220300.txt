So your enchanter obviously got his targetting right. :P
In fact, I don't see how a new target indicator will help me (i play an
enchanter) in the situation you described. If you see a circle around
the targetted mob then switching to another target will only slightly
move this circle around. Since Mobs can stand in exactly the same place
this won't help much. It's the same situation as with the flashing text.

But I do see an improvement on incoming mobs. The flashing text appears
quite late imho. If you have an indicator which is seen as soon as you
see the mob you can start to mezz/root/what ever right there. So I'm
looking forward to this change.
