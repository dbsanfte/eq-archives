MIn spec is 256mb, and 512 is still laggy for me on a Duron 750...

Not on the supported list... if it works at all, kudos...

Below listed required specs (16mb) and again, either a 32 or 64mb card
would do you a world of good.


If you have a tight budget, I had a similar machine (K6/2 450) with
256mb and a VooDoo3 card and managed to run SoL ok, with most of the
models turned off.  Both a 128mb chip and a VooDoo card can be had for
cheap these days.  As can most of the GeForce2 MX cards... in the $20
to $50 range, depending on your selection.
