*Snips out all the maths so as to insert a question*

Does your skill with a weapon effect the max damage or chance of hitting for
max damage too ?

I ask because my Beastlord uses a 13/27 feral claw in his main hand and has
a max hit for 55.
He also has a 2hand blunt weapon a 23/44 Groaning mace but I find my max hit
seems to be in the low 50's.

I'm assuming this is due to the fact my hand-to-hand skill is maxed where as
my 2hb is only at 60 (way below my max).
Does anyone know to what seems to be causing this low damage ? is there some
kind of damage cap for skills below 100 skill points ?

Thanks
