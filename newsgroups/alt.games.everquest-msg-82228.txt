Yeah, the Gorge is another name for "Beholder's Maze".

Get to about level 25 ( random guess, I don't play a druid ) and you can 
rotate the 2 Evil Eye spawn, make cash, and handle it if either of the 2 
minor Lords pop.  Kill one, med for 3 minutes, kill the other, rinse, 
repeat.

Now, if Lord Soptyvr pops up on the throne, maybe you can harmony him and 
keep going.  If not, maybe a higher level person passing through can help 
you.

 An Evil Eye      17 - 21  Monster  
 An Evil Eye Pet  15 - 16  Summoned  
 Lord Sviir       19 - 22  Monster  
 Lord Soptyvr     29 - 30  Monster  
 Lord Syrkl       22 - 22  Monster  
 Lord Sviir Pet   16 - 18  Summoned  
 King Xorbb       25 - 25  Monster  

These are pages on Allakhazam I tend to use a lot:

We were killing the Evil Eye Prisoners in Runnyeye the other day to get 2 
sets of runes for Crafted.  Between the 45 or so minute spawns, we went 
back to the Gorge to show our Druid friend the EE camp.  He SoWed me and I 
ran the whole gorge, smacking everything once to get it aggroed ( except 
the Goblins ).  Then, I would go back to the Eyes, and he would cast a DS 
on me and we'd whack them to death.  Easy way to raise one of the RunnyEye 
factions.

If you haven't, yet, look closely at the map of the Gorge. Interesting.

Also, say the names of the Lords out loud.  Took my friend several days of 
camping to see that one.
