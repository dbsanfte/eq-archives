Easiest to 250?
Jewelry... Platinum Jade Ring trivials at 250, so you COULD go from 0 to 250
in one session... all you need is cash and wrists of steel (and prolly a
spare mouse or 2). No tradeskill farming is going to be particularly
difficult for a 50+... just incredibly tedious.

Useful to non-Enchanters? Depends on your class... Fletching, Baking,
Brewing are directly beneficial... Smithing and Tailoring can be good (but
not recommended if you want quick results).

Yes, all the old recipes work... but not all of them give the old results.
Some baking recipes now yield more, lots of smithing recipes are easier than
they used to be.
