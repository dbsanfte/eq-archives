Well, if you look at the levels of my druid and ranger, you can see I have
not been to high level zones.  I have not been in places with cats, at least
not without the intent to kill them, recently either.  The places I have to
base my knowledge on are the commons, and karanas.  It's probably been more
than 4 months since I've had my druid or ranger doing anything there.
