    Seems like you're wasting mana by casting Yaulp so often. You also risk
losing damage output if you're fighting something where you time your Bash,
rather than use it for damage alone. When I solo "a small mushroom" or the
Deep Cavern Lotus in Fungus Grove, Bash is a tremendous weapon in
interrupting their casts and I hold it until they start casting. With a
single hotkey that could mean losing one fifth or more of my damage output
as well.
