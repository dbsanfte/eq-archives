Maybe the only ones to survive were the Bard Kerrans, who were wearing
Singing Steel Gauntlets.  As far as radiation, I'm not sure what the tenth
thickness for fur is, but maybe the armor is dense enough to attenuate
gammas.

Given the surface area to volume ratio of the vascular system, even the
slightest swelling will drastically increase the volume of the system.  This
would drop the total head loss of the system, and lower the discharge
pressure of the heart.  Now, dealing with saturation pressure and
temperature, we know that as the vascular pressure drops below saturation
temperature for blood, it will begin to boil.  There's also the factor that
the swelling of the blood vessels is due to the blood trying to equalize D/P
with the atmosphere outside it.

Indeed.
