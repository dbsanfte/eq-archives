Yes, those mobs with the names that are not quite the same as the
normal generics are on the SRo rare spawn cycle.  There are about 14
different known mobs on that cycle.  Speculation is that the AC is on
that cycle, with about a 2 percent chance to spawn any time the prior
thing on the cycle is killed.

It is not known for sure, though, that the AC is included.  All the
data I've seen is consistent with him being a rare random spawn
independent of everything else going on in the zone, but is also
consistent with him being on the spawn table you noticed.

OOT is much simpler.  Sit at the one place the AC can spawn, and kill
whatever spawns there.  Something spawns there exactly 6 minutes after
you killed the previous thing that spawned there.  Do this until you
get the AC, or go insane from boredom. :-)
