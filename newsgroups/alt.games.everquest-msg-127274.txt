Oh, by the way, while doing this I have my primary
slot lute on my cursor, and juggle it into the primary
slot just as Hymn finishes casting, then swap my weapon
back in, hardly any interruption in swings and substantially
better HP regen this way.

I'd love to have a primary slot drum to do this with, but
since I don't it seems too much trouble to swap out
primary to drum to secondary, secondary to weapon
to primary, once per cycle... don't have any notes as
to what the DOT damage is with and without drum, or
the MR debuff for that matter, am I crippling myself by
being lazy here?

Here I keep drum equipped so that Fufils does more damage,
and so I can yank out selos at full speed whenever needed.

Here its drum in hand and secondary slot lute on cursor, so I can pop
lute in on the bounce for better heals.  I haven't bothered with
also juggling a wind instrument in the mix, as I've noticed no difference
using one for the charms, either stick rate or duration.

Thing that annoys me most here is using droppable instruments or
weapons, on a couple occaisions I've dropped something when
clicking off the TBoot effect or the Selos effect.  Thus far its not
been in the heat of battle... or maybe it has, my Combine Lute
seems to have dissappeared.  Anyone know  of a reliable way
to click off a buff while you have something droppable on your
cursor and not lose it?

I could set drop to confirm, I guess, but as I'm constantly foraging
(have it set up automated off my turn keys) and frequently get junk
I can't eat or drink, that will be a bit of a pain...
