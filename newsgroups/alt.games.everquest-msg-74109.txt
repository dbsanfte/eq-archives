I'll probably eventually look back at these.  The hobbit I thought was a
little boring.  The white-gold ring was extremely boring.  Think your not
actually suppose to read one word after the other, but skip the stupid
descriptions which was like most of the white-gold ring stephen-something
author series.

remember reading the hobbit, and was a little bored.  Personally I don't
care what things look like, at least when it comes to boring descriptions.
I'm much more interested in convo / plot / action.  preferably siding on
plot and action, with convo furthering plot.

probably should be skimming alot more.  ROFL

remember writing about 10 pages with the way I like to read, and had a
friend proof-read it, his first response was that it needed more description
about how things look.
I guess people cannot visualize it enough unless you describe at least
roughly what things look like.  ::yawn::

currently reading Robert Jordan, and definitely enjoying the latest
paperback.  :)
