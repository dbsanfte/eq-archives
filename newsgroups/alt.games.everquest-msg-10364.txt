    When I was creating my monk I put most of my points into agility so my
strength has always been lower than I would have liked. I recently paid 80
pp each for 2 jagged bands. Now I have looted 2 cougar claw earrings in Ice
Clad. I went Saturday and killed a bunch but no luck. Then Sunday my buddy
Jakugg came with us and we got one each, wooo hooo. Then last night another
buddy of mine Everman came and joined me and we started killing more of the
furry bastards. On the kill where I dinged 33 I got another one, wooo hooo
hooo.

    Almost all the money I have made so far I spent on weapons. The only
expensive things I have bought so far are the two rings and a executioner's
hood for 200pp. Other than that I have Gem Inlaid Gauntlets I did the quest
for but most everything else is cured silk. What should I look to buy for my
monk next or where should I be playing to loot good monk stuff? And please
don't mention things costing in the 2k and up range. Sure I would like to
have a FBSS but I'm a long, long way from having 8k. Actually, right now I
have about 200 in the bank.

By the way, I feel much better about getting the earrings from my kills than
the jagged bands I paid for.
