>Can anyone tell me what "camping" actually means these days?  Here is
>the scenario I've encountered, but first let me preface this with what

Whether I agree with it or not, this is what I see as camping:

1 or more people playing one or more characters that are rotating monsters 
as they spawn.  If you can take them down as they pop, then it's a camp, 
whether it spans a long hallway or multiple rooms.

If the person "camping" the Geonids is killing 1 while 4 more are sitting 
there, then fuggem.  If you don't believe in camping, fuggem anyway and 
make them share, but make sure you don't mind the consequences.
