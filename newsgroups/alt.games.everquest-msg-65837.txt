Howdy guys,

Howdy all,

With nowhere to turn and another dead end I turn to you guys for assistance.

I have recently bought a GF2 Mx to replace my aged Voodoo card and am
having(I believe !!) compatibility issues, I have an Aopen FM56-USB modem
and since I put the GF2 in my machine I am getting Linkdeaths in a game
called
Everquest (online role-playing game).  I have disco'd the USB modem and
replaced it with a standard serial modem and everything works fine, but soon
as I reconnect the USB the problems come creeping back.  General web
browsing work fine.  So to do the USB modem and V3-3500 together within
Everquest.

If anyone else has
similar probs to mine and knows the remedy for fixing it I'd be most
grateful.....  My system specs are as follows:

ASUS P3V4X mobo
256mb mem PC133
P3-600 (running vanilla)
SB Live
OS - Win'98SE
GF2 Mx 32mb (cheapy taiwanese brand - they all reference boards I believe)
4.3 & 10.2 drives

Hope this is sufficient for the technical minded, Ive tried a range of
drivers for both the vidcard and modem to no avail. I can be reached on the
following email address (eqjunkie1@iprimus.com.au) Remove '1' from email to
reply.

Hope someone can help.  Thanks a bunch guys
