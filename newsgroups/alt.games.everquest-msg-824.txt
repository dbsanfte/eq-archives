On Mon, 15 Jan 2001 18:29:19 -0600, a muggle intercepted an owl from
Tony <Tony@litenet.com> . It read:

Up until 25 or so (some higher depending on equipment choices I think)
you can even tank. I group with a chanter cleric combo and end up
being the tank quite a bit (as druid) around 30 tho being the tank
REALLY stinks hehehe
 
But you can fill almost any role as a druid. It depends on what the
party is weak in... BIG thing tho, if you're the healer don't nuke cuz
just as soon as you do something will wander by, jump someone, and
you'll be OOM and unable to heal them and they'll never forgive you.

If you're in there fighting and not the primary healer be real careful
about your dots. The fire and swarm dots will stack, and that REALLY
gets the critter mad at you. Add snare to that and the tank is going
to have a heck of a time taunting him off you. Which defeats the
meat-shield purpose of the tank. He's got more hp than you do, let him
get hit. If you dot twice stay back far enough so you don't get the
critters attention.

When in doubt ASK the party what they want you to be doing. I always
ask. If they want me to fill a role that I think is stupid I'll try,
unless it's going to end up with me being dead of course. More than
once I've learned something that way. More than once it's been a
dismal failure too. LOL

OK, so you want me to walk INTO the tizmak cave and then cast harmony
on myself so it will hit all of them? You're SURE this will work, I'm
already KOS with them. You're SURE you've done this before? I don't
think it's gonna work. OK, if you insist... cast SMACK SMACK SMACK
TRAIN!!!!! told ya! running.
