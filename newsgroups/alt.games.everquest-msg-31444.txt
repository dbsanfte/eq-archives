What exactly are their enforcement policies? if it's just relying on the
players to petition or the off chance a passing GM will spot it then thats
fairly non-existent.
Surely they could have it so that when a name is submitted, it is matched up to
other strings such as 'wantsomedrinks' and 'spankmymonkey' and as many stupid
names they can think of and if a match is found the name is rejected.
If nothing else it would force the wise arses to be a little more creative.
