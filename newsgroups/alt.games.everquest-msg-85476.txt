Shadow Haven was my main bind point but since locking up while zoning there
is pretty common (as common as zoning in Velious) I've changed it to
Nexus...nice thing is, it's REALLY hard to find a zone that loads THAT
quickly, and when you're expecting to be click-sticked back, it saves a lot
of people time.
