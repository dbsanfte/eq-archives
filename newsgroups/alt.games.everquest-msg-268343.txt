No, the label said dont *drink* it and I said I agreed with it.  Some here 
implied that snopes.com was sufficient authority to rely on when it said 
even a couple drops is dangerous.  That was the context of my comment on 
thinking about stuff that is passed off as authoritative fact.  Why do you 
keep implying that I somehow disagree with the warning label on the bottle? 
I never did and in fact explicitely agreed with what it said.  I also 
explicitely said dont drop a couple drops in someones food.  It may not do 
anything but it is still wrong to do.  You can think about what snopes says 
and come to the conclusion that they are bogus, and you can think about the 
fact that rat poison says dont drink and come to the conclusion that I 
already knew that.  There is no conflict between these two suppositions.  It 
is just plain stupid to believe that 2 drops of visine will kill you. 
Firstly because anything in your eyes is in your body.  Chemicals in general 
do not evaporate away.  And secondly because it is obvious to anyone with a 
brain in use that this little rumor has probably been tried millions of 
times by waitresses around the world without repercussion.  If they were 
killing their customers they would have got caught.  no doubt.
