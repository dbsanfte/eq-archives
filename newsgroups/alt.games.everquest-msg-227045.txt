I've been XPing my mage a lot lately - just got 54 last night.  Group was 55
Rogue, 53/54 mage, and 60 druid.  Zone was Charasis (aka Howling Stones).
And you know what?  We did just fine, HT'ers and all.  The rogue knew how to
evade-pull, so we seldom got doubles, and when we did I offtanked with Mr.
Bubbles.  Had to be careful about nuke aggro, since rogues don't have taunt.
But in two hours we put on a yellow and a half, got me to 54, then put
another half a yellow on me.  I'm not sure how much XP the rogue and the
druid managed.  Note, though, that the total buffing and healing we had was
a single druid...
