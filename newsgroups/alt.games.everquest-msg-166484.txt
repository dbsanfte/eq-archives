No, actually, I think it was very smart of them not to make the random
name generator auto-check it's suggestions before settling on one to
give. An automated run through the name filter would be repeated at
high speed until it finds one that clears, then offers it to the
player, who then will more than likely try for another and another
'til he finds one he likes. That's gonna end up taking up a LOT of
unecissary processor power on their end at the speed it would be doing
it with an automated process given a good number of players trying to
get a random name at the same time. In fact, a full guild of pissed
off people might even be able to crash the server by creating traffice
by all running random names at the same time repeatedly.
