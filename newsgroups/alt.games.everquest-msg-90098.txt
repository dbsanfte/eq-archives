All too true. Its just about impossible to get in a group as a druid.
Soloing means you die just about every time you do LD. You can still make
reasonably good money porting people around, I guess they are too wealthy to
want to wait. Ive put my druid into virtual retirement, and am concentrating
mainly on my cleric, and a bit of bard. I have almost no trouble finding a
group with either of these chars, and once grouped I feel like im actually
pulling my weight.

I dont regret playing a druid as my first char, I just wish I hadnt wasted
time getting it up to 56. One decent thing, I got succor to drop a little
while ago in skyfire, so another 9 blues and I will be useful for those WW
raids, at least as far as getting there goes.
