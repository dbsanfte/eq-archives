Sorry for the piggyback, my server is being odd about 
which articles are showing.

Afraid of people catching up?  It's in the very nature of
a game where the the highest level is capped, eventually even
the slowest levellers get there.  

I had a blast playing under vastly more challenging conditions
than any new player will experience now, even on a fresh, no
transfer server, like they are discussing.  My bard had a 40%
experience penalty, I lost twice as much xp on death, money
was hard to come by, weapons with 1:3 ratio were uber, and if
there were maps of the zones, I sure didn't know of them.

I think part of the fun *was* the fact that it was so 
challenging.  I don't begrudge any newer player the things that
make it easier - Easier money, less painful deaths, incredibly
cheap and easily found equipment that vastly outperforms the
stuff I had then, access to KEI and BoA for a bit of PP - I
think they may be missing something of the experience, but that
is their choice.

The thing to think about is that, while KEI makes you vastly
overpowered compared to your environment at lower levels, it
is merely very nice at higher levels.  There was always a spot
in each character's life where the game changed fundamentally.
For me it was at 51 with my mage - life had been so easy in 49
and 50 (the 49 fire pet is a monster) that the sudden slog of
51 was a shock.  The more overpowered you are at the lower levels,
I think the greater that shock will be.
