Raptors in TD are much fun. The area is not camped much and it is out of the
way so you generally won't need to deal with bashers.

At 52 with 205 WIS and some +mana items, I could succesfully finish a quad
only with ES Vambs. Raptors have almost NO LOOT (occasional words), 3Khp,
double for 100-110, bash, are not resistant to anything, and have HUGE
aggro. The island is designed with wanderers, so adds are a problem. Just
keep lev and Sow up and its very safe, running over the water will generate
enough distance to med if needed.

I actually prefer to root-dot, and occasionally charm one for a pet. Exp is
about 80% that way, but much safer than quadding in case of LD. Also, you
are always doing something rather than medding 20 minutes for a 5 minute
fight.

With the addition of Lesser Succor (18th level) getting to Raptor Island is
simple. Zone into TD from BB shuttles (or Oasis, I think) and jump of the
boat, cast Lesser Succor, and boom - you are on Chessboard Island a couple
hundred feet Raptor Island.
