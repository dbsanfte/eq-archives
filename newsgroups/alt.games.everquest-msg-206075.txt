It seems to me you've been reading this ng long enough to know that the 
amount of affect that STR has on damage inflicted is miniscule.  It makes 
the rare big hits look impressive, but makes very little actual 
difference in damage inflicted.  If you are finding yourself constantly 
encumbered, then there is a good reason to raise your strength.  As for 
dex, short of massive boosts in dex, it makes little difference either.  
What you should be looking for in equipment is AC, HP, STA, other stats.
