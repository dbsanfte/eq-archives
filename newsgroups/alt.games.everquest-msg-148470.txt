Actually the dirfs he's talking about don't have faction hits that can
bother epic stuff.  I never killed them though cause I'm a bit of a faction
whore (annoys me to this day that I managed to accidentally go KoS to

Slate just cried out to get owned while I auctioned back in the good ol' EC
days)
