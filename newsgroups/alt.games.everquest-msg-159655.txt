Probably your skin got some sort of problem. To me it seems like EQ is 
VERY bad at handling skins after patches. Me and a friend running exact 
same skin, he sent me his files so i could use them.
Then some patches ago, my skin wont work, but his work. I crash to 
desktop every time i try to use or load.


Today, i go to desktop if logging char in with new skin, or when zoning 
AFTER loading the skin.

Friend still dont have problems.

Its a shame skins work that badly, cause its a cool idea, but im 
considering stopping using custom skins, since my skins either broke or 
kicked me to desktop after around half the patches since they were 
introduced (excluding POP fix patches and server maintenance patches)
