In response only to your subject line, since it's all I have to respond to.

Yes.  Unequivocally, Yes.

I was 17 when I started playing, and I never really had that whole "teen
angst" thing with being a jackass to everybody and such.  I didn't have any
problems while playing my warrior up to 30.  Then there was a 3 week hiatus
after his unfortunate demise, that made me more irritable temporarily.  When
I came back, I started my necro up, and had no problems, got him to 10, and
started my druid.  Somewhere around level 27, my dad decided that he didn't
like EQ, and so I can't play it at his house, but my mother is
technologically inept, and doesn't have a modem, so nearly all of my EQ time
ends up being when I go over to a friends house on weekends (yeah, I still
live with my parents at 19, fucking whee.).  Ever since that point, I've
become jaded, obnoxious, apathetic and sarcastic, yeah, it's probably more
of an addiction issue, but suffice it to say that I'm generally pissed off
20 hours out of the day for some reason or another, although my dad's
remarriage probably has something major to do with the sarcasm and apathy
factors, since me and my stepmother have conflicting personalities (the
remarriage was back when I was playing my warrior).

Of course, I've never exactly been the most stable of persons, earlier in
life I had a tendency  to basically spend all my time dancing from addiction
to addiction in some way shape or form, nearly all of them having to do with
computers, since I've always hated people in general, for many reasons, but
mostly the difficulty of communication with most people due to my having
extremely bad hearing, and a near-complete lack of social skill.  (IMO, all
the extra stuff when talking to people is useless and clouds up the purpose
of conversation, which is communicating information;  talking about the
weather, or asking about people's health, when you really don't care wastes
time and breath)  I've also always been extremely paranoid, distrustful of
authority, and socially rebellious.

I had a point when I started this, but now I'm just angry again at
everything in general.  Of course now everyone will know how seriously
fucked up in the head I am, and how fucked up my life is in general.
WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!
