Ummm.. I do this! :-)  My friends have complained they don't have enough 
room 
on the /friends list for all of my alts! When I get bored with one, I switch 
to another. My current chars:

26 Iksar Monk - Play this the most. Love this class, in a guild, the works.

20 Barb Warrior - First character, played almost exclusively to level 20 
when 
soloing became unbearable (and I usually have to solo during the week).

13 High Elf Mage - First caster I really liked playing. Love the pet/nuke 
combo.

10 Iksar Shaman - Created to attend guild events mostly, but then he got 
twinked and I figured out that I really like him.

7 DE Cleric - Was supposed to play her exclusively with a friend's DE SK, 
but 
he's taking a break from EQ. Playing her more lately to get MED!

4 Wood Elf Ranger - Created last weekend when I was SO frustrated looking 
for 
Skulking Brutlings with my monk.

3 Erudite Ench - Placeholder really, haven't done much with her besides have 
my warrior give her some starting PP. Got to get her out of Tox before I do 
anything more with her.

2 Halfling Druid - Potential money maker/mule.

I also created and deleted a number of other chars along the way. Pretty 
surprising that I managed to get my monk to 26 with all that goofing around! 
:-)

I change chars when I'm bored, can't find a group, whatever. Also, like 
being 
able to see different parts of the world without necessarily travelling long 
distances.

Maybe I just have too short of an attention span? :-)
