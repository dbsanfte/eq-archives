The only server with trivial loot code, items dropping when you are
far above the mobs level, is Firiona Vie. However, on FV that is only
true of MAGIC or LORE or something items. So on no server would you
not get mundane things like batwings, if you were above the mob's
level.

As Tech wrote, loot is determined when the mob spawns.
Batwings are darn cheap, as well, in unlimited quantities on the
Erudite vendor in East commons, in the middle inn there by the zone to
West commons (she is on beta neutral faction to boot, so she is indiff
to all) Other vendors with unlimited batwings include some outside
cabillis (Lake of ill omen?) who are iksar friendly, as well as at
least one in Shadowhaven (I think I heard one is there) I believe that
POK also has one, but am not positive.
