A couple things I forgot to mention about the group that cleared the
Tak Observatory tower... it was a slaughter mission (second request,
I had just started my "rescue and assassinate are easy too" stump
speech when the leader got the mission).  And, it was a three tank
group (2 Warriors and my Paladin) in which I did most of the pulling
but was not MT.  I had fun, trying different pull tactics and ways
to transfer agro to a Warrior.  I'm a mid-50's "casual" Paladin with
decent but far from uber gear, similarly geared Warriors who know
what they're doing tank much better than I do (unless the group is
totally clueless).  I'm just not at the point in the game where the
Warrior's advantages get overwhelmed by everything else.  Two of the
best four LDoN groups I've been in had a Warrior or two in addition
to me, which suggests that the biggest problem for Warriors mid-50's
is not class intrinsics, but rather the fashion slaves who believe
everything they hear.

ROFL.
You misunderstood me.  The only way I get multiple invites is by
putting up LFG at prime-time (LDoN prime-time on Tunare server, that
is).  And my original motive for taking whatever comes along is that
I rarely get a quick invite unless it's prime time.  So what I was
trying to say is that, in the spirit of making lemonade out of lemons,
I now look forward to the challenge of dragging a crew of half-literate
d00d-wannabes through an LDoN dungeon.  Of course, in a few levels I'll
have to start being more picky, unless I want to endure a lot more
failures, but these mid-50s dungeons are just easy to beat.

Dammit Spock, that's no way to argue!
