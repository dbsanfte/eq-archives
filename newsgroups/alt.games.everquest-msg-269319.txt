The San Bernardino County Sun newspaper has two articles about "online
game addiction".  The first, "Video-game addiction seen as growing
threat" interviews a student who got "hooked" on EQ, and also talks
about Shawn Woolley, the Wisconsin man who killed himself and whose
mom Liz Woolley blames the makers of EQ for his suicide.  That article
is available at:

The other article, "Addiction specialists offer ways to unplug oneself
from video games", talks about Liz Woolley's Online Gamers Anonymous
(or Olganon) web site, which features a 12-step program similar to AA,
and also quotes from other addiction specialists.  That article is
