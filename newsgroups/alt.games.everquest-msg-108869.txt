Forgive the incredibly "newbie" question, but what is the Sleeper, and
why is it a big deal when he's woken up?

Is it just that they were able to get to him by taking down larger
"bosses?"   (Like an old-style Nintendo game!)

And why does Verant get ticked off when a group does it?  Why have
they banned or disbanded guilds for doing it?  It's not an exploit, is
it?  And if it's bad, why don't they fix it so it can't be done
anymore?
