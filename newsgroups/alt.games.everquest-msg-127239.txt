down and wouldn't turn on i was furious then i started unplugging all the
wires to see what was wrong then it came on i got to the Windows Password
screen typed my PASSWORD in then i logged onto the net again and loaded Ever
Quest when i got on i thought a moment then i thought SHIT!, i forgot my
Screen Handle so i started trying to remember it for about 2 hours, then i
just said sack it i couldn't remember it at all, now it's been a year i was
