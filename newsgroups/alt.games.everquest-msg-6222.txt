I've been running a P3/450, 128mb Ram, 56k modem, Voodoo Banshee (ick) video
for my whole time playing.  I've had barely adequate framerate, occasional
lag, and zoned in about 30 seconds average.

I went up to 256mb Ram this week and my computer as a whole is a TON faster.
With Word2000, for example, hitting Print, selecting a different printer,
and 'ok' would take about a full minute.  Now, about 5 seconds.  Same with
the dropdown font box (shows them in their font) would take about a minute
the first time used for it to 'draw' them...now, a couple of seconds the
first time.

EQ, on the other hand, doesn't seem a TON faster.  Since the upgrade, I've
been entirely in Iceclad and my lag meter is often over 1000.  I'm anxious
to hit my first zone to check how fast that goes.  One big difference is
going from the Server Select to Character Select would be 2-3 minutes
before - now, less than one minute.
