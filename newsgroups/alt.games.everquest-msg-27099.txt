I think the key here is intent.  If the intent is to have it read as the
original word(s), then it is a misspelling, yes, even an anagram.  If that
is not the intent, and the anagram/spoonerism/whatever is purely accidental,
then it is not a misspelling.  Now, as to how you judge intent, that's a bit
tougher at times, although in the case in question, I don't think there is
any real doubt.  It is an intentional misspelling, which is also a
spoonerism.  And yes, I know, this argument can go on forever, I doubt
anyone is going to convince anyone else of their side of the argument.  In
the end, the point is moot, if a GM decides it is against the rules, he will
change it, argue as much as you want.
