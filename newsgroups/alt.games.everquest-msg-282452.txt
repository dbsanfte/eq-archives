Which is a bigger stretch, to assume that nobody that read it is from the
southeast U.S. (or any of a myriad other places where the general culture
would deem that an offensive comment), or to assume that there probably is
someone that read it that would take offense?

You should look into that whole education thing.

Hello, groups.google.com, please read because you've obviously forgotten
that yesterday existed already.  Look for my direct response to bizbee's
post.  See one?  No?  Imagine that.  Now try arguing with one foot here in
*this* reality.

I responded when bizbee tried to compare his statement to one by John
Lennon.  Sorry that you seem to have forgotten that.
