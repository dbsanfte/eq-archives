EQW stands for EverQuest Window(s).  It's a little program that lets you run
EQ in a window like you do other programs instead of having it take over
your computer completely.  I used it for a little while, but got sick of
having to upgrade it after every patch...  I have multiple computers so it
wasn't that much use to me, and the window made it harder to see stuff.
