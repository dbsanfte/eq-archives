The message I was getting after buying out stock of item X then trying
to buy another one due to the icon still being there was:

"Could not purchase.  You may only possess one of those items at a time."

Which led to much head-scratching, I imagine. "WTF? High Quality 
Cat Pelts are LORE now?!"

That was clearly a bug and is probably what got fixed here.
