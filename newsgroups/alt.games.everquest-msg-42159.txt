As some of you may know I have been a little vocal about my feelings 
about what has happened this very sad week. Some have misunderstood my 
ramblings, some have agreed and some have disagreed. I still hold true 
to my feelings.

On the other hand, my eyes have been opened just a little and I must 
soften my stance a bit. I still hold to my beliefs that the United 
States should not act alone (or with intermittent help) in trying to 
make the world safer.

I have seen today (and this week) how much respect there is for the 
United States in the world community. Often times, over the last twenty 
or so years, all we have been exposed to here is the derision and scorn 
upon my nation. Maybe those feeling have been misplaced. It is truly 
unfortunate that a tragedy of this scale has motivated the world to act 
upon this scourge.

Anyway, I would like to publicly thank those from every country who kept 
the United States in their thoughts and prayers ... regardless of 
political beliefs and personal opinions. Hopefully, with the world's 
help, we can end this cycle and coexist together a little more 
peacefully. And for those behind this or wish us (all of the civilised 
nations of the world who despise actions such as this) ill-will: We will 
hunt you down and eradicate you.
