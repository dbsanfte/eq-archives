No, and now that our tracking cap has been increased, you too can have the
fun of running halfway across a zone to find a mob on track. No, you cant
set your tracking down, and track like you were lower level. Easiest is just
to forget about tracking to pull mobs in a lot of places.

FYI the mobs are sorted by spawn time. VERY useful. nuff said.
