The usual Moon route is PC till 24-26 then either:
 
1.  Netherbian (loot is not terrible, most mobs drop 1-2 plat).  Often
deserted except for all the foot traffic going to Maru Seru or
Dawnshroud.

2.  Maru Seru  (loot is bad.  Good place for low quality rockhopper
hides if your into making leather padding). My 26th Troll SK is here
right now.

3.  Echo caverns - needlite cave.  Good loot (needlite parts worth a
few plat)
and easy if you have a Damage Shield.  My Bard went from 25th - 30ish
here.

After 29th or 30th, move to Dawnshroud.

My 26th Beastlord went right to Dawnshroud (he can take on yellow and
red mobs).
