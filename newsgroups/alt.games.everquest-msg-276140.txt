Due to expansions players on EQ1 can now level all the way to 70.  Players 
who max out at 70 then put all their experience into Alternate Advance 
points to gain additional abilities.

I'm on the Stromm server on EQ1 and it's thriving.  Lots of players 
throughout the level ranges.

Most of the additional content involves additional zones and mobs.  The new 
Dragons of Norrath just went live about a week ago and people seem to be 
enjoying it.

Hope this helps.
