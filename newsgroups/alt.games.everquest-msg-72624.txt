Heh, I find the order to be different, but the principle the same.

(a) my own stupidity
(b) raid-related
(c) you feel yourself becoming visible
(d) link death
(e) overpulls

I can't think of a death that was stupid-twink related or related to afk 
miscommunication...  Unless you count my own stupid twinks dying, but they 
usually at least manage not to take anyone else along with them.  And 
that's just category (a) again. :)

Hm, actually, I've had a couple deaths due to healer being distracted 
for just that crucial 2 seconds between chanter getting aggro and too late 
to start the heal.  That could be construed as AFKness, I suppose, but 
it's a stretch.
