Thanks to everyone for their info. As it turns out, the encumberance
was due to excessive coinage I was carrying around (dang Orc loot
splits). Duh on my part there. Anyway, the GM checked the logs and WAS
in fact able to give me all my items back. Everything worked out
great.  Would be nice if I didn't have to spend a total of 5 hours
waiting for results though.
