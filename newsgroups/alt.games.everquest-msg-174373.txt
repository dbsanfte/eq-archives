Anywhere on Antonica, Faydwer and Odus (original EQ).

Not the old planes.
Not Temple of Cazic Thule.
I don't *think* it works in Stonebrunt or the Warrens, it *should* work in
the Hole and Paineel and Kerra Ridge and Kedge Keep.
No idea on Jaggedpine, I doubt it does though.

I can't test directly for you because the only time I ever held a manastone
(transferring for a friend), the goddamn  thing killed me (itchy trigger
finger).  As a result I refuse to buy, borrow, beg, steal, transfer, trade
for, or let exist in my inventory, a manastone.
