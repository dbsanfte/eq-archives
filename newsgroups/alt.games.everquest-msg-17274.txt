Come on, did you read the original post? It�s so farfetched that the author
must be
a) A troll. Don�t answer trolls, except to point out their trollness.
or b) A fool. Same as for trolls.
or c) Someone out to discredit SPLC and anti-hate movement in general. Don�t
give them the satisfaction of an answer.
or d) Someone with a weird sense of humor. Same as c.

Also, it�s not only off-topic, it�s way off-topic. That is enough reason not
to answer, except to try to put an end to the thread.

Q-switch (hoping this to be the last post in the thread)
