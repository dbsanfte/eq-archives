 I have seen him in the past, that naked human, not necessarily warrior,
though.  But the first time I saw him, I got scared.  I thought somehow
someone else's character had intruded into my account.  The word over his
head did not look like Load, it looked like Ioad with the lower case L but
looking like capitol I.  Afterwards, I got accustomed to seeing him from
time to time and was not frightened any more.
