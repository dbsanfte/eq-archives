Yikes.  That's absurd!  Seems like the current definition of exploit
is directly linked to bugs in the code.  Where's the bug doing what
you did?

Incidentally...  Good idea.  Those brutes are non-agro, so I can just
picture you feigning, waiting 2 seconds to make sure it believed you,
and then standing up and binding your wounds right in front of it's
face.  :)  As a Shadowknight I may find this usefull too.  You were
able to Bind Wounds faster than the mob would regen?
