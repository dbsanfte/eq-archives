> So it could be true and you could still see great Ogre smiths.

And you sir are the reason I stated that it was not yet agreed about in the
tradeskill community . Yes either way would account for high str low wisdom
low int smiths to gain skill at the same rate as high int or high wis smiths
. However a high wis high str smith gains skill no faster than either a high
str OR a high wis smith.

It is a repeatable test just find yourself 2 shamans of high level in a good
uber guild that have practiced no smithing . Ask one to train to 50 skill
keeping track of attempts required using just base wis. Ask the other to
buff their str as well .

You probably wont be able to convince them but then again it only had to be
done once :p

Additional evidence is how a programmer given the requirement of ok we need
tank type characters to be able to learn smithing as easily as caster types
please reprogram accordingly would have handled it.
