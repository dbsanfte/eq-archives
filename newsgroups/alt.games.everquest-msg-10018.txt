Ok, you use a skill, you get better at it, just like in RL... you can even
practice a skill, just like in RL.  What annoys me is having to go find a
safe spot and sit there for hours working on a skill (or casting discipline)
just to get it to a usable level.  Nothing more entertaining than a night of
pressing the same button over and over to up that skill.

Anyone have suggestions on how this can be changed in future MMORPGS?
