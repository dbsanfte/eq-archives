I've been doing the hermit in SK, he is very easy and good experience.

Unfortunately the loot is very poor. Nine time out ten he drops a few
silver, every now and then he'll drop 1P, and very rarely he'll have a
fine steel weapon. At this rate I won't have anywhere near the PP I
need to buy the druid spells at 24 (why are they so expensive ? I have
no money at all, it was like 100P to buy the ones at 19 and I only
-just- managed to afford them, how can I possibly afford the next ones
?)

I tried paludal caverns but I don't like walking around with a black
screen, it's way too dark in there.

Is there anywhere else I can go that has even half decent experience
and more importantly decent loot so I can afford to buy these spells ?

Cheers,
