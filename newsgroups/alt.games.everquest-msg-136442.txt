EQ, old boy, it would be nice of you to stick to one topic at a time,
hmmm?   Would you care to explain what flight of fancy makes you think
a Canadian law has any relevance to the rest of the world's
population?   Your side-tracking is most amusing, but does little to
credit your views.  I know we are a G7 country and in the top 3 "best
countries to live in" according to the UN, but you flatter us too
much!

Just out of morbid curiosity, which parts of "human nature" and
"evolution" for the past 2000 years do you consider far play?   And
what is being re-written exactly?

I remember a certain country changing the course of history and
insisting on this pesky business of democracy and individual freedom.
That novel concept certainly had little basis in human nature, or
evolution, or history of the past 2000 years!    I say we call the
Brits back in.   By historic popularity alone the feudal system seems
more part of "human nature" than democracy!

EQ, do you wish to be a serf or slave?   Sorry, positions of nobility
are closed to commoners.   You will be told whom you belong to, where
to report for work, and what religion to believe in at a later date.
Since you marriage was not authorized by your Lord, it is annulled.
Should you ask for permission to marry- not normally granted for
commoner scum you!-- please remember that your Lord has first bedding
rights on a bride's wedding night.


Remember, young one, that history looks back, while evolution looks
forward.  Would you stop evolution because it differs from yesterday?
If you did, it would not longer be called "evolution"!
