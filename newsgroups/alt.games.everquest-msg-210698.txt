Yeah, but if I ever get 25k, I'll keep on saving and buy a spell that 
will be far more useful to me.  Mind you that's just for one single 
spell.  Then, when I amass that much again, guess what, I'll keep on 
saving, and buy, yes, one more spell.  Rinse and repeat, I have several 
hundred k worth of spells to go yet.

My epic on the other hand was free.   Fear,well, others in the guild 
wanted various drops there, so, it's not like a Fear raid was organized 
just for me.  The Hole, again, several others wanted drops there, so we 
killed several birds with one stone.  City of Mists, again, Ranger, 
Druids, and Magicians all were looking for drops there as well, off of 
some of the same mobs needing to be killed for my drops.  Mistmoor, I did 
have to organize a group to go in and kill the dire wolf, the rest I 
soloed.  For that effort I got a weapon that I have yet to see an 
achievable replacement for.

For a significant portion of the EQ players, epics are still one of the 
best weapons they will get their hands on.

There certainly are better out there for many of the classes, but, many 
of those better weapons are nodrop, and not achievable by a majority of 
the EQ population.  For the others, well, 15 to 25k is a lot to drop on 
one single weapon.  Particularly for those of us that are cursed with 
extremely exorbitantly priced spells.  I don't have any other way to get 
my level 65 spells yet, other than purchasing them.  My missing level 60 
spells are quite rare drops, and it's hard to get interest going for 
hitting the places they drop.  Right at the moment, with current pricing 
on EMarr, I have about 400k worth of spells to buy, just counting the 
level 60 and level 65 spells.
