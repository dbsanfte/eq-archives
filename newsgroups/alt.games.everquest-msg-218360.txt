Who is this Kiev of whom you speak?  Kaev is in a dysfunctional
family guild, it's been a long time since they raided anything.

Really, nothing more needs to be said.  But just in case you are
incapable of comprehending your own words without careful analysis,
I suggest you contrast your repeated snide remarks about "follow-

comments.  Then, for extra credit, go to a dictionary and look up
irony.
