Or..you could give her something that would get her out from behind
her desk.
Take her somewhere..
I don't know your budget but I guess a new PC set up would be nice if
yours is a little out of date.
I took my EQ playing significant other to Europe on a EQ type mission
I came up with.
English countryside then Spainish Castles, up to the French
countryside then up to the Nordic lands to see the...umm. barbarians
and their unique salad bars, German huns and then Rome. 
Then right back to EQ.

Just don't think computers , think EQ related and you might get more
options on what to do with your money.
