And none of those mechanics support entering credit card numbers or 
paypal addresses. If your buying droppable gear in EQ with RL cash you 
are doing it outside the mechanics, outside the sanctions, and even 
outside the EULA.

Excellent example. Someone else playing your character violates your 
license with SOE on several points (including multiple users of a single 
account, and sharing your password). Could anything be LESS sanctioned?

Except that doesn't pan out. People who fall into the trap of 'working' 
in EQ tend never to get out. There is *always* another advancement to 
grind, item to camp or what not. Unless you actually enjoy grinding or 
camping you are perpetually not having any fun.

They NEVER reach a point and say, I'm done, I got what I want, and now I 
can spend the next six months frollicking about in interesting places 
doing interesting things. Instead its... oh... I want want one of 
those... I'll go farm pp for another couple weeks... or oh that's a nice 
item... I'll go sit at that camp for another couple weeks. Even though 
the fun of taking out the camp will be exhausted in the first day or so.

What exactly is the 'fun'? And wouldn't it be far cheaper to just rent 
someone elses character for a few hours when you want the fun of playing 
that character, rather than comission someone to spend a pile of time 
playing yours?

Is that whay they do? Hang out? You mean they aren't there to get 
someone a drop or upgrade or a bunch of quick AAs? You mean if these 
endgame zones had challenging mobs, no loot, no pp, and no xp... you and 
all your friends would still be there taking them out?

Once maybe... just once. 

(See the 'Sleeper'. They haven't gone back.)

Loot and advancement *are* self-assigned challeges.

Its game destroying because it undermines the point of playing the game 
practically by definition. You don't need better gear to have fun 
killing mobs. Better gear just lets you have fun killing different mobs. 
But there is nothing inherently special about the 'new mobs' that makes 
killing them more fun than the 'old mobs' except that they drop better 
items. But if you are buying the items then you've just defeated any 
possible reason you would have for wanting to kill the new mobs.
