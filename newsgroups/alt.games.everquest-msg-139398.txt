While I might only have 615 mana in items at this moment, I would be
well within 200 points of the limit if I got all upgrades currently on
my wishlist (it includes several mana rich items in slots where I
don't currently have mana) that my guild is/will soon be capable of.
Even just completing the stuff on my immediate upgrade wishlist
(2 purchases, one item transfer from an alt, finishing 2 tradeskill
quests, getting woven grass leggings, and a pita quest for a 75 mana
hat) would see me over 1k mana in items.
