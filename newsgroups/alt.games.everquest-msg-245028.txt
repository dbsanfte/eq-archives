If PoD / PoN / PoI arn't good for you, other places to try might me:

The Grey - Take plenty fish scales until you can make up necklaces for
your toons as there's no air.  Some nice loots & reasonable exp at 55
although low ZEM.  I used to solo with my druid there at 55.

Fungus Grove - Not sure if its outdoor but it should be reasonable exp
at that lvl.

Maidens Eye - areas near to the zone lines should be OK if there are
not too many players camping.

All the other places I can think of right now are indoor :(
