Ignoring Ken's response to my post, the types of issues we are talking about
occurring in this particular case are far from obscure or resulting from
players acting like jackasses.  As I understand it, all you have to do is be
anywhere near the Freeport or Qeynos guards for the to spam you into LD.
The Luclin portals not working in either direction?  And the third one that
was reported was boats not working.  I could see things falling through the
cracks, but not that type of issue.  They obviously could not possible have
done any significant amount of testing on these particular patches.
