The 10 hotkeys are set in stone, and there can be only one bank.  There are,
however, 10 pages of 10 hotkeys.  You can pick up any button from the ALT-M
window and move it to a hotkey.  I can't imagine any good reason to use a
mouse to press a button.  With 100 hotkeys, I doubt you need to keep the
ALT-M window up if you learn how to use the keyboard to hit hotkeys and
switch hotkey banks.

And seriously, how the hell can you pull and use the mouse to hit buttons? 
Do you not use mouselook either?
