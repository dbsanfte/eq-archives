Verant removing: "You are being inspected by {Bunghole}"

wanna know why?!  because it's useless information and it doesn't serve any
real in-game purpose.  Damn, isn't that just freaking amazing?!  It's
similar to removing the "i am stupid and want to destroy everything in this
bag with the" combine button.  It's great to know that I wont trash some
decent loot because it happen to land in my tailoring kit.  how many times
have you accidently trashed something you held dearly becase the system
lagged for a second and you hit combine sted of done?  I did it once.  and
it was one my first crafted armor piece, plus a few other items. (after a
corpse loot)....

anyhow, back to the subject.

so Verant is finally taking it out...isn't that just friggin great?  Someone
over there finally had the balls to tell the programmers that it doesnt
serve any purpose in life what-so-ever.  so just take it out.  leave "you
are inspecting {a different bunghole } because at least you know who it is
you're inspecting.  I've seen some cool armor on some peeps...asked to
inspect...no reply...so I do a quick inspect to get the name of the
piece...then they start turning in circles...then take off a distance away.

anyhow...everyone applaud!
