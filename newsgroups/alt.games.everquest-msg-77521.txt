    Strong point for SoL zones, but a lot of raid time is still being spent
in SoV - especially by "second-tier" guilds.

    You don't have the enchanters Cripple, or are they tired of dying?

    Chain casting isn't the idea. Take the standard 6600 HP MA. That's 8
NTs, 9 if you want one bit of insurance vs. LD. The heal chain announcements
would be:

Cleric 1 CHealing, Cleric 2 up!
Cleric 2 CHealing, Gimps up!
<Insert Gimp Name Here> casting my crummy heal, Cleric 1 up!

    The idea being that having nine lesser heals land at once (modulo lag)
would be just as good as a CHeal. Obviously, you prefer a cleric to a gimp
link. But on my server, once something worthwhile pops you have minutes to
get to it before one of the big two guilds takes it down - you may not have
access to many players of a specific class like cleric on spur-of-the-moment
things like a Dain pop, whereas you will have numbers.
