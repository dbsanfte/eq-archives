Deluxe toolkits are the best option, you can buy them for about 2 platinum
in iceclad at the gnome encampment. Nobody is KOS there (unless you have
hunted gnomes in velious). If you are low level, there is a chance of
running into a cougar, but they do not normally path near the igloos, so
unless someone trains them thinking that the gnome sentries will kill it
like newbie guards (which they will not), you should be safe.
