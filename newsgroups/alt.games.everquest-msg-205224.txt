    Yeah, I noticed they made that mistake on a few pieces. Especially the
one Lizard earring - that's a really desirable item because of that slip-up.

    But the Veksar stuff is pretty much across-the-board "recommended 45",
so I don't think it was an error. Now the new items from Inner Acrylia
having no recommended levels at all, THAT looks like a mistake. 14/22 swords
with great stats and no recommended or required levels? Hmm....
