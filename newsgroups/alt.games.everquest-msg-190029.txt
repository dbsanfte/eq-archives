ROFL... no, sorry was using an Army acronym...

 N.B.C.  Nuclear Biological Chemical



not the mention of NBC as the broadcast line of thought... I heard a
interesting argument point about how the PoW's were shown on TV and
how that was against the Geneva convention due to Humilating a PoW.

the argument was that our own broadcasts are showing PoW's (Iraqi
prisoners) who are handcuffed and hands behind their heads ... isnt
that humilating..

Id agree that both are humilating... but the showing of soldiers who
were shot in the head executioner style is beyond humilating.... its
just fucking wrong.
