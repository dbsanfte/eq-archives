A magician and necro make the best combo, lots of dammage output, prolly
the best in the game, and malo makes darkness and fear stick all the
time.  Magician pets are tougher then the necro pets incase of pulling
two.

This combo will be able to take even and yellow cons all the way to 50.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I
advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives
boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the
ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no
character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant companion
of your walks."
