My Rogue gained 20th 7 times.

As a Paladin, I started hunting EEs at 26, solo.  I preferred
attempting them solo because that way I'd be less embarrassed by
attempting to kill my friends.  They were very easy hunting.  Later I
teamed up with some friends who were intending to hunt them.  The
secret is two-fold.  First, load up on Magic Resist.  Second, DON'T
HUNT NEAR CLIFFS.

For the first, when I hunted them, I was running over 100 MR with a
bard singing his MR song, and somewhere in my 70's or 80's without
him.  The longest I got charmed was about 10 seconds, and they never
touched me with their blindness spells.

As for the second, the most damage I ever took from an EE was 160+
damage when he blew me over the edge of a low cliff.  They use a
force-blast spell that hammers you backwards.

Teamed up with others, it was... interesting.  At one point both of my
partners got charmed, and I never noticed.  I mean, they were only
hitting me for 1 to 2 points of damage (I think the hardest I got hit
by them was 10), and I was sort of focussed on dicing the EE.  On the
other hand, when it did get me, I whaled on our Druid for about 50 a
pop.  She didn't like it much.  Good thing it wore off quick.
