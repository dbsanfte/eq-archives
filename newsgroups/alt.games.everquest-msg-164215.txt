 God, changing faction too easy! It was dull and painful trying to change
faction by handing things in, and now it's ludicrous. Unless you can do it
by bashing things, forget it.

So my iksar monk is ally in thurgadin, and was ally in large sections of
kaladim and greater fay, but he will never be able to change his old world
factions in the cities there.

I always dreamed of getting him non-kos in qeynos, and now that's nerfed. I
roleplayed him as an unbeliever, an exile from cabilis, and now, having got
to be point where i could really improve my faction Oh well, at least the
rangers of JPF like me. Anyone remember that crazy iksar monk who wanted to
improve all good factions? Wonder what he would have made of this.
