The freeware version allows you to configure that as well, but the popup for
the game comes up after eq has taken over the video, and is at times
impossible to get to in order to tell ZA to allow EQ to access the internet.
You can manually configure it, but it's a hassle, and given that my router
takes care of my firewall needs, I just don't worry about it, and close ZA.
