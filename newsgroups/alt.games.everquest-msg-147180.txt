Feedback loops don't prevent 'bad' behavior, they correct it
after it happens.

Sure, in the short run.  Changes on a society level necessarily
take a long time to correct.

Slavery still exists in many "pagan" societies, just as it did before
the advent of Judeo-Christianity.  It doesn't in any Judeo-Christian
society, at least on a recognized level.  The civil rights movement
was predominately ran from churches (going back to the abolitionists)
as a faith-based behavior.  Opposition was largely done as a social
issue, even in the churches that opposed it as a breakdown in the
status quo.

Any religion is going to struggle approving behavior that's against
its basic tenets.  That's not limited to Judeo-Christianity.  Still,
it's a fairly good example that some of the most profound changes
come as a result of recognition of those rights from a faith-based
perspective, as in the churches that do recognize gay rights as an
legitimate issue, because recognition of those rights as an issue
core to the faith motivates lots of society to turn to a neutral
stance, if not a favorable one.
