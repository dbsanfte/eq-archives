I have to agree, what about the people who are avid 'nintendoid 
droids'? I see a *lot* of sprogs at blockbuster videos renting 
different game system game programs, and my 45 year old brother 
has quite an extensive collection of games for his [playstation? 
xbox? I have no clue because i dont do game consoles, i just get 
him gift certs as presents and let him buy what he wants=)] and 
he spends about the same amount of time playing that a lot of eq 
players do...and his kids play about the same amount...

I go to the mall, and the game room there is packed with kids, 
and I know  they are there together most every day from the level 
of familiarity they show each other ... and when I was growing up 
in the 70s game arcades were pretty much the same [just pinball 
and crude 70s video games, nothing like the stuff they have 
today!] and we had kids from my school that went to the arcade 
and spent until it closed 4 hours later each day. Same difference=)

And what about people who play nongambling  [heh] games like 
bridge? I have an acquaintance that does bridge, he is forever 
either playing it, entering tournements, whinging about losing, 
and reading books and magazines about it. He is in an online 
group that talks about it endlessly...

And when I worked for state farm, one guy in my office was a 
referee for physical sports, he was forever leaving work dressed 
in stripes and headed off to referee a game, and I know he did it 
both saturday and sunday...and at least 3 days during the week. 
At the kid/little league level so you cant even say it was 
because he was getting paid for it!

Not that I am pointing my finger at anybody and making it out 
that they are wasting time, hell I am unemployed despite my best 
efforts to get a job, so I admit that I am in game a *lot*, but 
when I worked, it was abotu 3-4 hours in the evening, and about 6 
on saturday and sunday...and my husband and I had plenty of out 
of game quality time together...
