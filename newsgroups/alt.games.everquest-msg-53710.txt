I really do not like putting people on ignore. Even from a jerk I want to
hear if he yells train to the zone I am sitting at.

The 2 reasons I go anon.
1. So I will not get constant tells for ports or SoWs.
2. So I do not get constant tells while in a city or newbie zone from
beggars that see my level.
