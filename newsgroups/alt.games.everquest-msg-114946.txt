While this works quite nicely, it doesn't help the pure melee classes out,
warriors, monks and rogues are pretty much buff free (with a few clicky
item exceptions) and simultaneously benefit the most from buffage.

On the other hand, if everyone follows your prescription, then those
poor groundpounders will benefit, as you will be buffing them along
with everyone else nearby.
