Mainly because it will either get the shaman or cleric killed unless
you're just strolling through with an uber group. Given what you've
posted about gear, AA, levels etc, I assume your group fell into that
category. Either that or you just happened to fall into a window of a
couple of weeks where slow wasn't being mitigated in the trials. 

All the mobs in the trials mitigate slow, we can assume slow is 50%
effective on average. Tigir's is a 50% slow, so those mobs hitting for
around 330 (iirc) will be slowed 25% from a successful tigirs. Torpor
or even the 500pt cleric HoT won't keep up with the damage that those
3 mobs beating on you will cause, cleric has to use a real heal and
since Tigir's doesn't have all that much agro, they'll then be beating
on the cleric. 

That also ignores the fact that a 61 shaman isn't gonna land any kind
of slow w/o a debuff or a lot of luck. At least one of those mobs
beating on the shaman isn't going to be slowed. 

To the original poster, it kinda depends on the DPS of the rest of the
group. If you have enough DPS where you don't need the cleric or
shaman for damage, then back up the cleric on heals and help spread
the agro. Maybe pull one or two and root park em. If you have a nice
uber tank and a high end cleric to heal, pull out your best DD (Spear
of Torment at that lvl), assist off the main tank, send in pet and
blast. If the shaman has cann5 and a horse he should be able to do
decent damage. 

Make sure the shaman summons pet ahead of time, buffs and gives him 2
weapons, then calls him down once you start the trial. 

Do malo and slow the boss mob, the only nice thing about having the
shaman along is that if you make it to the final mob, you'll usually
win.
