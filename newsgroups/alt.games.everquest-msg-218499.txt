Another, but very rare, problem that could cause maps not to show up is if
you initially download them into a copmressed folder and then open up into
/eqmaps they will not automaticly decompress (my brother faced that problem,
since Internet Downloads folder is copmressed by default in new
WindowsXP-pro), or as to that matter even mere presense of "Archived"
attribute on the files from EQ-tool box prevented me from seeing them. Go to
your  maps folder, select them all and remove the atribute (but I have not
had that problem on my old computer with Millenuim). Although most likely
you just have the  height filter on. lol.
