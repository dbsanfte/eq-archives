Big assumption there, I'd say 1/3 of the drops are crystallized
sulfur.

I don't remember whether the the JB Helm drops off of those scarabs or
not, been a while since I camped them. You have one mob that might be
able to drop a RBG, the wandering Krup. Anyone ever seen one drop on
the first floor off of anything but a krup? 

 As for the ODS, I'm reasonably sure that none of the spawns in that
area will drop it, they're too high level. You'd have to pull the mobs
across the bridge, back towards zone in/out, to have a chance at that.


It's been a while since I did scarabs but 1k an hour seemed like our
average haul. But that was usually in a lazy duo so we weren't really
clearing more than the mobs past the bridge to the locked door.
Hitting 1500p an hour was definitely high end. Assuming Iksar blood
sells well on your server, there's actually a better and easier money
camp in seb than scarabs.

Yeah, I can see that. I'm not saying that farmers aren't a problem but
holding up seb as an example just doesn't work for me.
