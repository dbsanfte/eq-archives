Unless someone counters in return. I'm not much of a poet (which is what
made it well written, in my opinion), so I admittedly could not make a reply
as well as Lokari's. However, I fail to see why it was made a point.

Arguing with logic is also generally fruitless. How many people do you know
actually keep an open mind in a debate?

I don't know about you, but I've never heard anyone say, "You know... you're
right. Many of my past opinions seem so false now that you have spoken with
logic."

Do you respect camps? I do - Verant doesn't. Verant makes those type of
rules just so they don't have to play Cop.

any way.

You're right. No one has the right to screw you over, though.

You don't have to suffer to learn. Otherwise, you would have to stick your
hand in a lawn mower to know that that is a bad idea. The right thing to do
would have been to either leave the items at the mercy of others (not that
there is much of that going around these days) or pick up the items, wait
for the real owner to return, politely explain as to why that is a bad idea,
and return the items.

Heh... for a long time, I always thought I was different because I tend to
be rather callous and cold. Now that I see how other people think, I think
it's safe to say that the world is full of people far worse than I.
