I agree completely. I had a Gnome Warrior that was a blast and was
constantly being /tell'd to come join a group for his tank abilities. Now
he's in dry dock in South Karana and noone even say's a word to him. Iv'e
since moved on to a Froglok Cleric and I must say, that so far he's been a
bit of fun.
