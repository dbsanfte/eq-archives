Back in 1977 I was a guest at the Carillon Hotel on Miami Beach and was able
to arrange a tee time on the Blue Monster since the two facilities were
owned by the same company.  It was a great experience.  There are multiple
courses on the property.  Be sure you play the Blue Monster.  Number 18 was
the most daunting hole of the day.  I can't speak to the wisdom of gaining
virtual experience, but don't think that it would be worth the effort.
