I ding'd 41 last night in Crystal Caverns soloing terrors.  It's
unbelieveable how easy it was.  About 80% were dark blue and the rest light
blue.  They are spread far apart and easy to fight one at a time  The
crawlers were also dark blue and easy to solo.  Spiders are easy but you can
almost never get less than two or three on ya at a time.  The geonids were
dark blue also but they have a faction hit so I only killed one.
