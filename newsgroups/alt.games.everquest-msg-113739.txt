I equate a polite SoW request with a polite "excuse me, do you have
the time?" request in RL. Both require negligible effort to respond to
the request.  Would you say to a person who wanted the time, "no I
don't want to tell you?" "If you want the time go buy a wristwatch?"

To go a step further, druids have the perception of being rude, greedy
assholes. By saying "no" to a polite request that costs you
effectively nothing in terms of time and effort you are perpetuating
that perception.

Point-blank refusing a polite SoW request is inexcusable.

>A "no, go fuck yourself you whiney butsucker" would be inexcusable.

Well it certainly would be one way to deal with people who walk up to
you and say "sow me".
