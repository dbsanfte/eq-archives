Heh, I think you're talking about another Faydedar raid - I've only
been to one wipeout and asides from the fact that I do not recall you
being there, we didn't have to summon the corpses :)

I think we did him with only one casualty once, and I am not sure
anyone died at all. And he's one hell of a lot more fun than camping
the stupid fish in Lake of Ill Omen... I am so very encouraged by the
fact that a friend spent 3 weeks looking for the corrupted barracuda
before he gave up.
