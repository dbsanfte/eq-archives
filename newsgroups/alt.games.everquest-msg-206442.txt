Mithaniel Marr;

A couple of months ago

Had just started my cleric that my guild needed (low on clerics)....

There was a GM in GFay who was calling for people for a drunken race. 
About three people total turned up (as it was for running drunk on the 
top of Kelethin- people didn't want to die or were too busy)-

I was one who competed. Died the first time then when he realised he had 
only a couple for the second race he said to run from Kelethin POD lift 
to Felwithe gates.

I won that race as I'd had to have run it a million times in the past. 
So I ended up winning.

Gave me about 7 or 8kpp worth of gear for winning with the most 
memorable and  thus still wearing them item I received were Thunder 
Etched Gauntlets. Got some netted kelp which I recently gave to a much 
poorer guildies new lowbie alt.

Nice event- lasted about 20-30 minutes.

Matt
