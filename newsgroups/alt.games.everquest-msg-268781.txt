"Guild pride." What is that? the nerd equivalent of being in a gang?

Hmmm...I've encountered EQ1 guilds insist everyone show their tags, and 
even dye their armour according to certain colour codes to show 'guild 
pride'.

Me, I'm not going to participate in that sort of asinine herd mentality; 
I don't need validate myself by ensuring everyone knows who I am 
affiliated with... But that's me... for *you* whatever floats *your* 
boat.

However if the dubiously valuable distinction of having your guild tag 
float around over your head must be bought at the expense of the guild 
en masse continually slaughtering 0 xp mobs... well... what progression 
oriented guild would even bother?

Hell, if they've followed EQ1's lead then I'd bet other players can turn 
them off too, so even if you 'earned' it, there'd be no gaurantee anyone 
else can see it.

...

All that said... surely one doesn't *have* to continually slaughter 0 xp 
mobs to earn and *retain* your 'tag'?
