I think it is people just adapting to what the game has to offer.
If you consider this cheating,  then I consider the Nerfing of
characters via patchs a form of cheating to find character balance.

If the rules of Verant's Universe are going to constantly change, then
the player should feel free to utilize everything the game has to
offer.

I just ignore it. I'm playing the game for "me"- I don't really care
if people around me level faster due to cheating.
