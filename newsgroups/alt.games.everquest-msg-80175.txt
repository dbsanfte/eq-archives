Heh -- you're going to love this one...

People are *supposed* to figure out how to get into
the Inquisitor's room via the locked doors (presumably
through some key quest) before they tackle him.

But the people that killed him bypassed the locks and went up
and over the wall and come down through a hole in the ceiling.

It took 45 minutes(!) to kill the guy.  And when they did,
they looted:

   "Cuirass of Sad Exploitation" ("Cuirass" is a fancy
   name for a breastplate) which had NEGATIVE 99 to
   ALL stats, resists, modifiers, AC, you name it.

And:

   I forget the name, but some sword with INCREDIBLE
   stats, best ever seen in the game, but flagged None/None
   for allowable race/class.

ROFL!

Gosh do ya think Verant saw that coming and designed
a way to give the finger to anyone who killed the
Inquisitor *without* coming in the locked door?
(Presumably, triggering the doors the "right" way will
cause the Inquisitor to respawn with his "good" stuff.)

The game designers are starting to get clever.  :-)
