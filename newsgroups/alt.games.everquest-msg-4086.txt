It doesn't autoequip all your stuff instantly, you still have to
click on each piece.  However, now you don't have to drag
stuff onto your body (or into the portrait window)... each
piece you click on will check to see if the body slot it fits
in is open, if so it drops directly there, as if you -had- dragged
it over and dropped it on your portrait.

If you want your PGT in your primary hand and your
gnoll whip in your secondary, loot them in that order.

Anything that already has something in its slot will drop
into main inventory, just like it used to when looting, and
like it does now when dropping on your portrait
