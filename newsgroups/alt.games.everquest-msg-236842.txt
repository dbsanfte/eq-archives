I think that's a pedantic approach to the argument.

Its a convenient choice of context.

Yes if time is exclusively a trait of the universe then a temporal
reference like 'before the universe' has no meaninful interpretation.
Its true that its generally recognized that time in the universe
'started' with the universe.

But the 'idea of time' is not necessarily an exclusive property of the
universe. There may be a point of reference outside universal
space-time from which one can experience a separate manifestation of
time-space or something more exotic and from that context meaningfully
refer to a before and an after to the creation of our own space-time
reference.

It may be true that there is no such context, but it is a convenient
hypothetical tool. And its hardly irrational.

The only thing that makes the universe universal is that we named it
as such. There is nothing observable that would lend credibility to or
against the statement that there can be only one.

pride? I do derive amusement and enjoyment... but an ego stroke? not
really... after all...really what's there to be proud of here?

I would call *any* argument at this level of metaphysics to be
inherently on very shaky ground. Nor am I opposing anyones particular
choice of belief, but instead merely suggesting that at this level a
number of choices are equally rational.
