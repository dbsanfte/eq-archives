Its not that hard.. just make the quest guy always up but have him not
always drop the item. After you kill you have a 7 minute timer to when
you can reagro him again. That way everyone gets to kill interspresed
throughout a 7 minute period with everyone re-killing in order every 7
minutes... when it drops for you, you leave.
