Baically it comes down to people getting in the way, it's a lot easier to
communicate between 1 group and control 6 people than it is to make sure 30
people are doing exactly what they are supposed to do.

  Its also alot easier to keep track of mobs with just 6 pc's, having 4-5
groups in the way, the tracking of mobs becomes a nightmare for your
enchanters, which means a greater chance that 1 mob will slip thro the mez, and
that tends to mean dead chanter/cleric.

And if the worst should happen and you do get death's, by doing it this way it
means you have a second group roughly equivalent to the break in group that can
finish the job, if however, every1 had gone in together and you wipe you're
left with a very nasty corpse run.
