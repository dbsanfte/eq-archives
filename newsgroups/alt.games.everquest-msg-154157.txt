Arrows (at least, the ones in SK...don't know about ones were you were) do
somewhat obey world geometry, so just get a rock or a tree or something
between you an it, and you should be OK.

I used to root the Centaur Archers, and then step behind a tree, so I could
nuke them, without their arrows hitting me.
