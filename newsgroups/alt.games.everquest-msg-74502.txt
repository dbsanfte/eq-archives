There's a myth out there that if you forget to turn in your
note you are screwed.  This simply isn't the case.  The note is simply a lowbie
quest that gives you some xp, and an AC 2 tunic.  There is no, "you are now
an official member of the guild" aspect to it.

Just go right-click on one of the masters in the guild and you are ready to train.
