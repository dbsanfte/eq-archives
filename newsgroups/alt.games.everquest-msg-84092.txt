Its invasive and it (the message) actually lags you if they spam
inspect you.

To answer the question:

to fix it, so you can't tell if they inspect you or can't ever get
spam lagged (good bard killing tactic which is against the pnp), put
this line under defaults in your eqclient.ini:

(Defaults]

ShowInspectMessage=FALSE

You will never get bothered with people inspecting you again.
