I assume that what you call "toon", I call character.
And that's the worst of it ! NO ! I did NOT buy the account because there
were higher lvl chars...I bought it because I just wanted the expansions !
When I bought it, I really thought I would just need to install it, and
boom, there you go, Kunark & Vellious & Luclin on my own char.
Even worse - the seller did not have a clue either that the keys were not
transferrable. - sounds naive, but who can honestly say they read the EULA ?
Suggestion : how about a big red sticker on the box saying : ACCOUNTS NOT
TRANSFERABLE. It feels like these insurance policies that hide the important
bits in the small print. Considering that I am, like all of us, a
regularly-paying customer, I would have expected some kind of warning.

There was a 25 lvl ranger on another server, not Sullon, stripped of all
gear, so of no interest to me.
Next time, I will not assume that Ebay is cheaper than Amazon - just had a
look and found out that Everquest Gold sells for less than what I bought the
game from ebay. Naive ? GULLIBLE is a better word.

Doh.
