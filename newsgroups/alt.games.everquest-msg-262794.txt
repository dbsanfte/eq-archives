It seems to me the thrust of your argument is that the first X levels of 
mmog Y are a waste of time because you 'aren't playing the real game', 
and should be bypassed as efficiently as possible to get to the real 
game, be it via grinding, buying an account with a level 50toon on it or 
whatever.

The *solution* is that the game should simply not have 'waste of time' 
levels. If levels 1-20 are a waste of time they shouldn't be in the 
game. If the average player seeks to skip content to get to good content 
it shouldn't be there, or should be 'skippable' like the tutorial.

There is no reason to fix a game with bought items or accounts when the 
problem is simply poor game design. Fix the real problem. Perhaps start 
EQ characters at 40 or 50 or 60 or whatever and be done with it. 
Apparently the majority of players don't want to play those levels 
anyway. Once upon a time those were the levels players used to learn 
their class, but grinding and PLing have all but eliminated that, and 
most players really 'learn' their class post 60.

Revamp the entire lowend game, revamp the items, make everything no drop 
and start players at 50.
