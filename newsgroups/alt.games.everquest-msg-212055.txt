At least according to the people who parsed the datastream with showeq
back before the experience changes, the death penalty was based on
something like 10% of the experience a human warrior needed for the
previous level. This is why the level after hell levels gave you such a
huge exp hit when dying, because the previous level's exp was so huge.

My recollection was they specifically stated death experience wasn't
touched with the adjustment formula, just like any bonuses in place
weren't touched.

60 is particularly bad for exp loss or it was when it was the top level,
which was the last time I was 60. If I recall right it's almost 10% per
unrezzed death in 60, as it takes very little experience to fill your
bar at 60. 65 on the other hand is 5% per unrezzed death. Has anyone
passed through 60 lately? Was this changed with the addition of 61-65
levels. It certainly didn't look like the 61-65 levels were smoothed
into the regular experience curve when PoP came out.
