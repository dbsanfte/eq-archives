On a mob that doesn't give an actual message upon a successful taunt
(ie: 99% of eq mobs) how would a warrior know whether his button mashing
had been successful or not? I could taunt 10 times, and still not be
successful, while the rest of the group stands around tapping their
feet.

If it's an easy group, I'll break every mes the second I'm ready to
engage, firstly with slam, then taunt, disarm, autoattack mashing. it's
really not worth standing around taunting if the group is ready to kill.
If you're standing around anyway to space a spawn, by all means
taunt/disarm.

If the enchanter doesn't want to get hit, he should be memblurring, not
relying on a warrior's taunt, which can fail as much as (parsed) 94% of
the time. By all means tell the warrior to hold until you've slowed,
tashed, crippled, and then memblurred before breaking mess if it's
imperative you don't get hit.

What defines bad play? 

Not working with your group. Simple as that.

A bard playing manasong during a pull would be a 'good' player?
