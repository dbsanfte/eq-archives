Is it??  Never heard that one before and I am going on 12 years on
USENET...

Care to point to the reference??

No, it's an opinion..

If I were to say you are a complete and utter asshole, because you
cannot debate in an adult and mature manner w/o resorting to personal
attacks,  would that be an opinion or a fact??

Illiterate??

Oh and that is not a personal attack..

Well, congrats, RS... You get to join Lena in my MKF..  :^) 

So sad, you actually had potential.  But I insist on adult mature
debates where I can match wits and not have to worry about being
called names like "clueless" or "illiterate".

Have a happy..  :^)
