I just recently had an incident with a 50+ monk in Hollowshade. I had been,
up until that time, hunting the sonic hunters and had logged on after a few
days rest to see that the zone was now owlbears. So, I decide I'm gonna try
one out. The problem is they are really close together and I'm afraid of
getting a gang of them jumping on me. Anyway, this monk was there farming
pelts. I found a nice, solitary owlbear and lay the usual slow/dots on him.
He broke root, but I was confident I could handle him. Well, the fight had
barley gotten interesting when the monk comes over and kills it within a
fraction of a second. I mean, I didn't even have time to register he was
there. So, I just say "ahem" to which he responds "what?". "I was killing
that". His answer possessed the pricelessness of idiocy: "So?".

Needless to say I left the area.
