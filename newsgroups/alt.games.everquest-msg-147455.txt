I think rogues have little to no place in EQ.Not by any fault of there
own,but EQ hasn't designed the game to accommodate them.They should design
rogue only quests which involve all there skills.Such as 'sneak' into high
pass hold and 'assassinate' a specific guard then pick the lock to the room
that holds a chest that you must 'pick '....and it would have great to
awesome loot in it.It would be a 20-30 lev quest but it should pay off.As it
is rouges and rogues are fairly useless.They should make all classes
useful?...?don't you think.



Ps. rouges are rogues they just don't Know how to spell it.
