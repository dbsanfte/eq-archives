I guess you conveniently missed the end of my post. Let me quote right from
the bottom of this post:

"By the way, let me wrap up any possible 'rip me off' excuse you might be
thinking up. Since you are buying the ticket, you will have the itinerary
and can wait for me at the airport in case you feel I might take the flight
and run."

I already closed up that possible excuse.

You are the one inviting me and TwoHead (individually) up there to kick your
ass. I have graciously accepted your invitation, but don't expect me to
waste my money in doing so. I am willing to kick your ass in exchange for
the ticket down, but I won't put my own money to go up there and waste my
time.

Apparently, the cost of a plane ticket should be negligible to you ... or
was that also a crock of shit? Dave's eaten up your entire piggy bank in
court?

I guess you'll have to content yourself with being labeled everyone's
"Usenet Bitch", and now the added sub-label of "Usenet Pussy". So much for
your rich tough guy act.

> Guess yer just gonna have to live with that..  :^)

Yes, I guess I will have to live with the fact that you're a chicken shit
pussy-bitch. Too bad for you. You could have proven you're a big man and
possibly gloated all about it on Usenet and IRC for the price of your ISP
and NNTP service connection of a couple of months.

Cop-out. This will make a beautiful reference in Google. Now you have two
counts of pussying out.

ROTFLMAO!!

Why don't you go join the folks over at alt.pussy and stop wasting time in
here?
