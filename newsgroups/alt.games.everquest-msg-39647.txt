Hehe, yeah, I've had worried people talk to me who almost seemed surprised
that their firewalls didnt pick up anything. But I'm not that good of a
programmer yet, I dont know how to send anything over the net, let alone
bypass a firewall. Again, not that I'd try, I'm not evil. :)

BTW - Hi Hesten! Everytime I see you in game I wave and run off, cuz you're
the only one I ever recognize from Veeshan posting here. Its only happened a
couple times, but I'm sure you've thought I was a bit of a nutcase. I get
that a lot. :)
