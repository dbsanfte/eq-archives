Oo. That one little word will do tons to invalidate your gripe. I 
personally had not problem aside from the *very* infrequent summoning to 
the zone of desktop others have mentioned. Of course, I was not on during 
the patching and re-patching process. Anyone not have any trouble who *was* 
on during that time care to chime in?

You're claiming that this patch was applied in a completely untested state? 
That's insane. You really have no idea what caused the problems that *many* 
people (not all) experienced. 

No offense, but this smacks of the typical "Sony sucks - I deserve 
perfection for my $12.95/mo.!" rant. Just accept that stuff happens, 
sometimes preventable, sometimes unforseeable, and move on. I am of the 
opinion that for the massive scope of their operation, they are doing a 
great job keeping it all running as well as it does - which, again, is 
pretty darn well as far as I'm concerned.
