Any clue on how their MR is and what sorts of attacks work best if
casters are hunting there? (magic, fire, cold, etc.?). I'm wondering if
a few 56/57 casters could xp in PoD off those mobs?

Do they seem to have any of those annoying "no movement change"
restrictions where you can't snare or root them? Are they stunnable?

I'd like to go try an xp session in the new expansion with my partner,
but don't care for an endless CR either.
