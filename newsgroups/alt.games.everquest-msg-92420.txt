Okay...thanks for the reply...what I'm "bitching about" is ...How was I
supposed to know not to move my corpse?  Where is that rule written?  I was
just trying to keep the same thing from happening to other players porting
in.  Maybe players who petition all the time are aware of this but it was
only the second time in almost 3yrs of playing that I have petitioned.

Also, if this is not considerd a "bug"...does that mean you port at your own
risk?

Thanks for the replies...even the flames  =)
