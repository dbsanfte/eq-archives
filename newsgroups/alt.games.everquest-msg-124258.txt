The only time a BL can fight his way back to the corpse is in
a place he can solo or travel through anyway, same as any other
class.  If the BL can't solo, any fight is going to send him
running for the zone again.   Monks (and rogues) can travel
through areas they can't fight in to get back to their corpse
(and back to an area where the monk, at least, CAN solo in.)

Mobs 32 and over (not 35) still have a chance of being memblur'd
immediately;  it's just automatic for mobs below that.  And that
chance goes up to 90% when they return to their spawn point, so
multiple feigns are pretty much guaranteed to work eventually.
Even if it doesn't (as sometimes happens with wandering mobs)
the monk can still run to a spot off the wanderer's path, feign
again and /q to lose the wanderer's aggro and move on when they
come back in.

There's a reason groups use monks (and rogues) to do CRs.  BLs
don't have the skillset needed.  And the rogue is screwed if
he does get aggro;  the monk isn't.  The only places I've seen
a monk unable to get back to his corpse were places where a
rogue couldn't go to open a locked door (ignoring the places
like the Hole where the monk didn't really WANT to get back to
his corpse alone because he wouldn't be able to get out
afterwards...)
