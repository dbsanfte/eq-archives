You know  you keep repeating this same thing over and  over again and 
every time I see it I hear to questions shouting in my heads:

1 Who decides what is a valid reason?

2 Why do you have to support your assertion that yours is the one true
way by name calling?

If in your opinion there are no valid reasons that is fine, say so.  I
have a valid reason for wanting inspecition either by permission only or
entirely done away with.  Roleplay.  I find that to be a very dang valid
reason considering the game I bought was marketed and sold as an RPG. 
Now you want  to call me a whiney minority you go right ahead, but name
calling really isn't much of an argument and really doesn't become you.
