Well ain't that interesting...my mom was mentioning this the other day,
but she works at an elementary school, so it didn't bother me.

I do have one bit of text near a link that says "Contains Adult Themes"
(I'm linking to another comic) and I say that my comic is PG-13, and a few
of my pieces of artwork show tasteful skin, but...I haven't yet figured
out why various filtering programs are going spastic on me.

One person told me that my webpage triggered their AOL filters for these
words:

"Insane", "heck", "AD&D", "necro:re:necrophelia", "sinfully"...

Maybe your filters don't like the word "heck" either? *snicker*

But being serious, what filtering system is it? I'd love to get some sort
of understanding, because if there's a way to get around these filters,
that'd be nice. I can understand a parent not wanting their 5 year old to
see the drawings I have with battle scenes, but it seems a bit overboard.

You don't suppose someone put me on a blacklist because my comic has a
supposed child sacrifice, do you? My husband warned me that I might piss
folks off for that.
