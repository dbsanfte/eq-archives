Doh!  Don't spoil his fun...if you aren't killed at least once by an NPC by
level 5 you're doing something wrong. <g>

I still remember the first time...in Qeynos...I forgot to hit Enter before
typing.  "A" is a fairly common letter when typing....

That's also the time I remapped my keyboard to change Autoattack to the "Q"
key. <g>
