That little suggestion is ridiculously prominent on ISPs websites.
Hell they usually direct you to their website as part of the long
intro recording that they bore you with when you phone them... as if
I'd be *phoning* them if I had access to the internet... 

/boggle


Then again I already know I know more than the tech support people I'm
going to wait the better part of an hour to speak to... the only thing
I ever hope is that the engineering has communicated to the support
team that their is downtime in some area or other, which they can then
relay to me so I don't even bother making an appearance at the site.
100% of the last 40+ times a client has had a cable/DSL problem ...
waiting for the ISP to fix it at their end was the solution, and about
80% of those times phoning the ISP resulted in clueless techs who
wanted me to unplug my router, drag a PC into the back where the
'modem' was and pointlessly reboot it 11 or so times until giving up
in defeat after finishing their troubleshooting flowchart suggesting
that I need to contact my PC manufacturer.... 

20 minutes later everything is 'magically working again'...
