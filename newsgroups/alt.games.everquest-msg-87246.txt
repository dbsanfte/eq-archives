Black Iron and Alloy drop just about anywhere in Runnyeye Mostly on the
bottom level. I personally like the Goblin Kings Room (2 on Eq Atlas 4th
level). Pickclaw Lords spwan is on a 15-20min timer very few wanderers plus
Black Alloy and Iron  drops in that room and the next room regularlly. Once
you have the Spwan times down its very easy to pull to that room and big
enough for a group to fight. Use Invis to get everyone down there.
