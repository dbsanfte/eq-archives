I concur, but unless it has been fixed with the last series of
patches, have one annoying issue - with the 23.11 drivers, I go LD
ever 3.5 minutes, to the second.  with 21.83, I don't, but suffer
extreme system lag (not a top of the line system, but 700mhz, GF GTS
Pro and 512mb is well beyond recommended specs) to an extent of
getting a frame rate of 1-5fps... not exactly acceptable...

OTOH, the graphics improvements are staggering.   I like the new
models quite a bit better than the old ones, although losing what
appears to be a foot or so in height as a barbarian is a little bit
odd to get used to )  Look more like a Mafioso henchman than a
barbarian shaman )  And to finally look like something other than a
walking pewter can, with a bear head on, at level 44, is just so nice.
