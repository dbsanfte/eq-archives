Ignoring all the personal attacks from both sides here.

The likely issue is not that auto attack continues to be on while FDed, but
that the server and your computer don't agree on when things occurred, so,
possibly, an attack was registered by the mob, after you FDed, thus breaking
the FD.  I don't play any FD classes, so I have no personal experience
whatsoever to draw on, and could quite possibly be full of shit here.  Given
the postings of various people here who do play FD classes, that sounds like
the most likely reason.  So, it is likely a good idea to turn off auto
attack, delay a bit, then FD, just to increase the likelihood that the
server and your computer are synchronized.
