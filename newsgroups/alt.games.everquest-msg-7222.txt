The exact way of doing it was, at the zone in, the caster would swim right
up to the right wall, and cast eye of zomm.  The eye would appear in
Phinny's room.   Phiny would aggro and kill the eye, thus aggroing the
caster, and since teh caster had not engaged Phinny, he couldn't be
summoned.   So Phiny would instead warp over to the caster, and the waiting
party at the zone.  He would then be greated by cold, blinding, death, and
thus, an epic(?) encouter would be made trivial, because the rest of
Phinny's room wouldn't have tagged along, like with a traditional Phinny
pull.
