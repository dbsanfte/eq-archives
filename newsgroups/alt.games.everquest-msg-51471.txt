Interesting thoughts...but, as a cleric, you would also be more inclined to
help others (why else would you be a healer?).  I have a high elf paladin
and that's how I view it.  I think the way most people fail to role play
high elves (myself included) is by grouping with dark elves and other evil
races (regardless of whether they "say" they are no longer evil).  A high
elf would never tolerate a dark elf because of their views of the world and
the gods they worship.  But, since I can, and many of my friends choose to
play evil races (and I never have, preferring the way of light), I group
with them anyway while trying to stay in character....
