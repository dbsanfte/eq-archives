I did start the game without any friends that I could play with, on the 
recomendation of a couple of RL friends of mine.  They were way too high 
level to group with me.  Not needing to move to some specific place to 
get together with friends, I just started out where I was, Kaladim at the 
time with a dwarven paladin.  I had an absolute blast with him, finding 
places using the nifty cloth map.  I drowned him under the freeport 
docks, no knowing how to swim yet, but did manage to recover his corpse 
after another long boat ride back.  That was when I discovered that a 
dwarf cannot just run onto the boat at Freeport.  I got him up to the 
uber level of 12, when I started my Shaman.

Again, I had an absolute blast, I knew a little more about the game 
mechanics, leveled up high enough to want to get my Serpent Sight spell 
so that I could actually see on my trip from Everfrost back into Halas.  
I found out that in order to purchase it, I would have to run all the way 
to Oasis on the far side of Antonica.  I died twice on that trip, once to 
a griffon of some type in North Karana on the way there, and once to a 
Highland Lion on the way back (that was when I discovered that there are 
mobs that run faster than I do with SoW).  I made the trip back to 
Freeport again, and on to Faydwer, where I made friends, some of whom are 
still friends of mine to this day.

It was definitely a very different game then from what it is now, and, I 
do miss that.  Part of it, I am sure, was just the newness of it all, 
this was the first MMORPG I had played.  A lot of it was the feeling of a 
vast world out there.  That feeling has vanished with the ease of travel.  
Personally, I liked it better the way it used to be, boats and all, not 
that I am going to quit over the changes, but, I fell saddened by the 
loss of what EQ used to be.
