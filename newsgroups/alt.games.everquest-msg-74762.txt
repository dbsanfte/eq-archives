Its not SoL related really. If you don't have SoL (like me, will buy it
though I think...) yo still have the problems. At one time, the loading took
so long, the boat just LEFT freeport dock again after I zoned in from the
ocean zone. I was still able to jump off and swam ashore, but 30 seconds
longer loading, and I would zone back to the ocean....

Very annoying!

Another problem I seem to notice on both machine i use EQ from is that
sometimes when you turn a corner, all over sudden the frame rate slows down
to about 1 a second. This seems to happen over and over in some area's and
none at all in other area's.

Its also not user related, because i have no problem in North Freeport on
the marketplace with about 40 users around me at any given time, and in
Quenos with hardly any users turning around the corner at some house give me
problems. I have 640 Mb of memory, a Geforce 2 and an AMD 800 Mhz processor,
and a defragged harddrive with Windows XP installed on it. I use the
original drivers supplied by Windows XP since the newest NVidia drivers do
not work correctly with my VIA chipset. I use a 1.5 mbit/s down and 256
kbit/s up cablemodem. My other comp (a mere 128 Mb/Intel Pentium III 650 Mhz
laptop, Windows 2000, Ati /M Video card) has the same problems. I don't
think its a resource related issue as I can also perfectly run across NFP
with no problems.

I did not play from the end of October till the end of December due to
travels. I first noticed the problems at or around the 20th of December, so
the problems must have been generated by one of the later patches. I suspect
the SoL patch to be the problem maker, and I hope they will fix it soon.....

Verant keeps sending me the standard "how to solve video problems" email....
So apperantly they don't know jack either :)
