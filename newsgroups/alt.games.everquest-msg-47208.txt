Not a flame, at all, but just a double check.  You have your:

LoadArmor17=TRUE
LoadArmor18=TRUE
LoadArmor19=TRUE
LoadArmor20=TRUE
LoadArmor21=TRUE
LoadArmor22=TRUE
LoadArmor23=TRUE

in your EQCLIENT.INI file correct?

I could have sworn there was another before, something to the matter of:

LoadVeliousArmor=TRUE

However, I cannot seem to find it now, odd.  Does anyone know if they have
done away with this now?

As for recommendations as to armor, I haven't any besides those that were
already made.  Tis why this would appear to be a flame/insult type post,
but, again its intent is not that. :)
