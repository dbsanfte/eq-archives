Were they refering to things such as traps?   I am max ally, and the traps
still hit me.  They are just objects on the ground that hit <whoever>,
regardless of faction standing

Just gives you more time for tanking while a healer is called in.  If you
CoH'd a warrior, then a mage, thats a long time for 1 warrior to fight an
unslowed mob, with zero heals.

DA is good enough too, CoH the paladin, then cleric, then ranger, then
chanter, thenwhoever.  There is no crowd control at this point, its just 1
mob who you must kill, without it running.

At A, there is only one way into the castle.  The 2 side windows are above
the deep pit (not particularly high, but its more than jump range), the
centre doorway is where you run in (theres a trap round here).  Its been a
while.. I think the trap is a small dd and a dispell, but I could be wrong.

Once you enter the castle, there are 2 choices.  Left (bypass prince) and
right (prince) - they both lead to the same place in the end.

I would never rely on invis/pacify to move a raid.  Just bad luck, or the
random duration factor killing people makes it too risky.
