 He probably simply left or did what I recently did when I got dropped by this 
"guild bug" that makes people lose their tag. I have, for the time being not
asked to rejoin my guild because, simply put, it was more hassle than it was 
worth to be in. I am a Wiz and found that I was spending far too much time 
gating members about, helping lower level Wizzies and casters with research 
(or just outright making their spells for them), participating in raids or
helping with corpse recoveries without getting much of anything in return such 
as help with quests I need to do.
 
 Since I have been out... I still help an occasional friend I made while in
but I have all my time to do as I please now. Such as try to find people to 
help with the quests I need to do.   :/
 
 So.. I would say.. if you play a class with have no real marketable skill 
such as a Warrior, go right ahead.. join a guild.. it will help you. However,
if you have a skill or ability that people will be clamoring to avail themselves
of get ready for a deluge of demanding people.
