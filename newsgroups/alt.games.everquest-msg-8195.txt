What she was saying, is that your mid and upper
level pet spells may be found only at High Hold
Keep. In point of fact, the erudite in HHK is
the only source for them. You will not want to
actually spend time there until your upper
teens, when you can actually level from 18 to 35
without leaving the area. Just move from the
Pass to the Keep when the mobs all turn blue or
green and have fun.
