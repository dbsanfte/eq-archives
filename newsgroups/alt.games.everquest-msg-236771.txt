All the lists are good, and I'd try and do all of them and more if
your new to the game. Why limit yourself to crushbone?... when you are
55th level at the end of list one you will have missed any enjoyment
you might have gotten from the zones on list 2 and 3.

Besides you'll learn more by trying the different zones. If you make
55th and you've seen a whopping 5 zones you aren't going to be a great
player.

Definately if you want to grind some xp its important to know where to
go... but theres really not much point to getting to 55th "faster".
The high end game isn't going anywhere.
