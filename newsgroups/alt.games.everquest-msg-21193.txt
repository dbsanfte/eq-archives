The fact that you are concerned is a clear indication that you will
NOT be a "bad" Druid in a group.

As a Druid you come equiped with one of the most flexible bag of
tricks in the game. You need to learn what all of your spells do. This
will help you decide how best to server your group. 

When you join a group make sure you know what everyones class is. If
there is a Ranger or another Druid make sure to decide who will Snare.
If you are the only healing class, then be prepared to save all of
your mana for healing. If you are a "Backup" healer, always keep a 50%
mana reserve for emergencies.

Some rules to live by:
1. Always keep everyone SoW'd (if not fighting indoors)
2. Always cast your best Damage Shield on the primary tanks. You can
do MUCH more damage this way than by casting your best Nuke or DoT.
3. Keep your mind open and flexible. Situations can change rapidly,
and if you stay on your toes you can save yourself and your group from
getting wiped out.
