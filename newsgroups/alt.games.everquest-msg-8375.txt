I'm all for anything that makes a game's interface less intrusive. I think
it would be neat to experiment with different macros for pet control, for
example. Not a big deal, and not something I think is a weak point of the
client, just something I'd like to play around with if the utility were
available.

Why would you think that I in particular would not even try it? Do I come
across as a technophobe? I'm the very much the opposite -- I love to tinker
around and play with how things work. I used to take alarm clocks apart when
I was a kid. <g> I am also as curious as a cat when it comes to software: I
probably install and delete ten programs or more for every piece of software
that I install and keep. And I may only actually use a quarter of those. (I
have to wipe my hard drive every six months or so and reinstall Windows, as
you might expect.)
