Bone chips can go for much more than that.  Batwings, however, require
either finding a sucker, or someone who feels like overpaying to help a
newbie.  That's because batwings can be bought in unlimited amounts from
vendors for under 3g/stack.  The casters guilds usually have such a
vendor, and there is also one in East Commons.

If you have a high tolerance for boredom and do not mind a lot of
clicking, an investment of maybe 20 plat to get baking skill up will let
you do fish rolls.  You can buy the ingrediants to make two fish rolls
for about 5 silver, and the fish rolls sell to vendors for about 5
silver each, so you make about 5 silver per try.  Arrange you stuff
efficiently, and you can do 30-60 plat an hour this way.
