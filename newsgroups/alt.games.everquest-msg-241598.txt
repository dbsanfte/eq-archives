Yep, same thing happened to us. Our barb had to use a gate potion.
What was wierder was when I summoned a pet at the top of the tower in TS,
and I got warped to under the world nowhere near the tower.

Yep. same happened to us. A raid member fell through a wall got agrod by
some mobs, and the cleric unknowingly healed him. Shall we say TRAIN?

After 2 wipes because of things falling through wals, we finally engaged the
main boss. Lost several members falling through walls during the fight, but
we finally prevailed.
Sheesh, I think we will just do outdoor mobs till they fix this.
So many problems, makes me wonder if they missed this stuff on test, or just
didnt bother reading the bug reports.
