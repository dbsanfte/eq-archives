No faction change is correct, not even deity correction, BUT, sneak
hide+ lowbie door key holder and 70 sneak+hide and hole key in under 5
mins.  IF you don't have an alt/box, usually you can find someone in
bazaar with one.

Hole key does go on keyring, it is transfered from the shroud, and
nothing I could see pathed into the vendor area while I was buying.
and nothing in paineel sees sneak/hide.
