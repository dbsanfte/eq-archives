ok, so i was trying to make a tin sword, and for a while everything was
going ok.  then, i needed another tin bar for one of the pieces.  no big
deal...i switch over to the tin bar recipe and when i click "begin" it says
"the components are invalid.  trade skill process halted."  so i think
that's a little wierd, so i send a /ooc and ask about it.  some guy sends me
a tell and asks all kinds of stuff about the fuel i'm using and what i'm
trying to make etc.  finally i decided it was probably just a bug and i
zoned out and back in.  sure enough, that worked.  for a while.  a couple
combines later i got the message again, zoned out, was good for a couple
combines, and got it again!  what's up with that?  is that a bug or am i
doing something wrong?
