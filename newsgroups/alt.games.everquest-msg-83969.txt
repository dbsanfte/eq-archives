Just go up to the Bazaar on Luclin. Zoning in from Nexus, go past the
first bank, take a left into the merchant building just past it. The
first merchant on the right sells something called a "Travellers Pouch"
for only one plat. It's a ten slot container that holds GIANT size
items. I have seven of them in the bank now. The down side is that they
weigh 25 pounds, making their name the ultimate in ironic jokes. I
wouldn't carry one around, but they are outstanding for bank use.
