First, you must make sure that you do not aggro the mobs too much. The
only mob you can let hate you much is your current charming target,
else the mobs will keep running at you instead of attacking your charmed
mob. Select one mob to be your pet. Put this mob in your tab buffer by
targetting it and pressing tab twice, thus targetting yourself and then
the mob again. This mob is now in your tab buffer, and you can target
it again by targetting yourself with F1 then pressing tab. Pull your
first mob any way you like, then train him over more mobs to add to your
swarm. The level 40 dispell song and the level 55 and 65 resist debuffs
OOS/HOS can be used to aggro more mobs without having to train them or
generating much hate. When you have a good size swarm, charm your selected
pet, press F8 to target another mob in the swarm and press your /pet attack
hotkey. Wait until it's low on health, break charm with invis (an instant
invis item item like Boots of the Mosquito or Goblin Gazughi Ring is
helpful but expensive (boots) or take ages to camp (ring), so unless you
can get one cheap just level up to 55 when you can use the Tiny Cloak of
Darkest Night which is a pretty easy soloing camp as a 56+ bard) and chant
it down. Retarget the same mob with the tab buffer technique so you can
chant down or recharm the same mob, because once you have charmed a mob
it will hate you so much it will never stop to beat on another charmed
mobs.

As long as you don't hurt or otherwise cause excess aggro to the other mobs
in your swarm it's quite easy to make them all beat on your pet, although
sometimes you need to train those mobs still following you over your pet
and whoever it is fighting.

Don't forget to group now and then or your defense skill will be abysmal,
but don't worry about it too much, it'll get up there eventually. I don't
think many bards max their defense until long after 65, soloing or not.
A bigger problem is your own grouping skills as a player, especially if
the bard is your first character - you don't learn much about the game
swarmkiting to 65.
