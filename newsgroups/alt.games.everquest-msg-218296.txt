The plan is definitely LDON but so far only 2 of us have it.  The
other 3 will get it shortly.

We are not on Sarynn but thanks for the offer.

The enchanter can pacify as well but I understand what you mean.  If I
do it and it goes poorly I won't necessarily die instantly, whereas
the poor enchanter will.  We've been down that road a few times...

Thanks for the input.
