I was trying to help a couple mages with a named mob in Burning Woods
one night. They assured me it wouldn't summon. It did. I didn't have
egress loaded, but I did have gate up, and was bound right next to
Chardok zone in. Pets died, mob gated, mages were summoned and going
down fast. I gated. Zone didn't reload. I was summoned and died
marginally less fast than the mages.
