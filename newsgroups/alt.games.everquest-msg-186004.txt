Your statement that the increased playerbase proves easy travel
doesn't hurt anything is a cum hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, and
therefore has nothing to do with opinion.

(Cum hoc ergo propter hoc: The fallacy is to assert that because two
events occur together, they must be causally related. It's a fallacy
because it ignores other factors that may be the cause(s) of the
events, and is a form of the more general 'false cause' fallacy. Note
that just because something is a fallacy doesn't mean it's not true,
but in this case the effect on increasing the playerbase was probably
minimal at best, and that really is an opinion. Logic is our friend!)
