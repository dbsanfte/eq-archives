Yep, incredibly annoyingly rare... when I finally got him, it was
because I gave up on help, and just soloed the spawn for 14 hours
straight till he finally bothered to show up.  My pet and I got real chummy
in that time... and even chummier on the next little goblin spawn.

I highly reccomend any cleric in their high 30s low 40s get a group
together and get some exp camping this spot, I'd have been -far- happier
if the gobbies weren't all green or occaisionally cyan.

This is correct.  You need only kill the center guy, nothing you do with
any of the others makes a single bit of difference.  Kill em, leave em,
train them to the far ends of LRathe and root/atone them... nothing
matters but killing the center spawn, and you do it as soon as he pops
as quickly as you can because this shaves a few seconds off the time
till the next repop... those seconds add up over the hours!

Deep spawns right there in the tower, but doesn't move around if pulled
away.  One strategy would be to purposefully pull her off somewhere,
so that you could massively overnuke the top of the tower with an
AOE.

It only seems like 28 minutes.

This happens a lot, about 3 out of four "tainted" spawns don't
result in a "corrupted" spawn.  I'm not sure if this is a bug, or
"broken as intended" just to tease you.  If you plan on getting
a druid in to kill and loot the corrupted, the trick is to have
atone loaded just in case.  Kill the tainted at a distance and
the corrupted won't aggro, but if he does you can root,
back off, and atone.  Shouldn't take a druid long to port
to NK, SOW up and run down to you to help kill that
corrupted.  Over my camp time I got 3 druids their epic pieces
and saw one rot because I killed first and called druid afterwards.

Right spot, just takes patience patience patience.
