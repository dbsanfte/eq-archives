Well, the Ice Burrowers in WW will remove charm pretty quick from my pet.
Funny thing is that since you can't cast snare after the charm, ensnare
always gets debuffed first - so I get an unsnared and angry ex-pet on me as
well as the IB ...

Back to the topic. IB de-buff is a proc, so maybe its different. I doubt it.
I have no idea why the Chroma's didn't remove charm ... Probably luck ...
