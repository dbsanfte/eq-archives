Hello all,

I lead a Fear raid at the weekend, which was pretty successful all in all.

We did the break-in with two groups (average level 56) and it took two
attempts.  The first attempt was add-city so we had to Evac.  The second
attempt we ran to the West wall and.... huh, where were all the mobs?
The difference was amazing.  So we killed a couple of wanderers before
getting the other two groups to come play.

It transpired that the Enchanter epic mob in the Amy temple was up,
so we made our way north and around the back of the temple, and a
bit further along.

We then sent a SK with Harmshield in to pull the knights and then to
try and split them.  Unfortunately he died, and as ALL the knights
came, we stood well back to reconsider our strategy.

However, thanks to Verant's wonderful pathing --- they pathed straight
onto the raid party (well, took 15 steps in our direction, before
aggroing and charging).  Wipeout.  Thankfully, as we had taken the
time to clear Fear properly up to that point, CR was just a case of
clerics zoning in and running back to the camp.

So: What is the best way of doing this encounter?  one suggestion was
to send a suicidal FD class to kite the Knights off to the other end
of the zone, whilst the Enchanter mob was pulled (different faction
so she doesn't join in the chase).  Any others?

(We didn't try again, as it had already gone midnight, and people were
starting to leave).

Thanks in advance,

Tris.

p.s. Yes, next time we'll approach the Temple from the South.
