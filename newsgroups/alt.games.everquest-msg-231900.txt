One thing people have forgotten about the marketplace is Location, Location,
Location.  Ok that's three things.  Where you sell can be a important to the
price as what you are selling.  I can and have gotten 10pp for spiderling
silk in the Bazaar, but no one wants to pay more than 1pp in the zones.
Same for pelts, 8-10pp in the zone, 20-50pp or more in the Bazaar.

People going to the Bazaar have money.  And there is an old sales slogan, If
your going to sell something, sell it to the rich.

For the people wondering if this is a fair pricing system, consider that the
Bazaar is a one stop shop.  Fire up /Baz, check prices, buy what you need
and off you go.  Need foraged items, they are there.  Need a lot of pelts,
they are there.  Don't have the time for running around the country side,
come to the Bazaar.
