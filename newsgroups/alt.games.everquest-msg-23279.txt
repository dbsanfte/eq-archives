I'd like to see a compromise -- the ability to
minimize the character-select screen.

Then you have to camp your character to check your email, but
at least you don't have to get ALL the way out to check your
email, then get ALL the way back in (since the loading time
between the server-select screen and the character-select
screen is the worst part of the all-the-way-out-then-all-the-
way-back-in process).
