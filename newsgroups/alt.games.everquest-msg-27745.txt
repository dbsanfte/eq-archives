Draco,

I've never heard of this SBLive! bug. I have an SBLive! and I run Windows
ME. Everquest sound is fine, no problems at all. Seeing as how ME and 2k
both share something in common; no 16-bit kernel, the problem may be with
your 16-bit DOS compatibility drivers. Try removing them (disable it in the
system icon in control panel).
