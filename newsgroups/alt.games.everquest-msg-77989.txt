  I doubt it.  Features and game mechanics are much more "fundamental"
features than a ruleset overlying the real features/game mechanics.
Firiona Vie is essentially no different from the other EQ servers,
except there are a few special rules that distinguishes it a bit from
the others.

  He intends for his new game to have broad appeal across many
audiences, so I doubt he is going to make the second least most
populated server in EverQuest the model for his new project.
