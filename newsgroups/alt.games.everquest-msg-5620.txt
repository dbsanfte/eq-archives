I get the impression from doing several quests in and around Highpass
that Carson McCabe works for no one. He is walking a dangerous line
and trying to stay neutral and in power in highpass. Highpass would
be an extremely valuable strategic point on Antonica, kind of like
Panama in the real world. Carson is like a leader of a thieves guild
keeping spies in all factions and working to make sure Highpass stays
right where it is: In the middle of everything.
