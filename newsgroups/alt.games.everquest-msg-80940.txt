Easy - well... kinda....
Two ways - it's a lot easier if you don't give a damn on Militia
faction (West and East FP):

Merchant faction:
Go to East Freeport, down into the tunnel at the docks,
find the DEF rogue, ask "what about janam and rebby?",
get note, go over to dwarven rogue, two rooms further,
ask "what message?", get another note.
Zone into West Freeport, find place of the Ashen
Order (Monk Guild), turn in note 1 to Rebby, get
Rebbys Rat Whiskers (stackable), turn in note 2
to Janam, get note, zone back into East FP,
down into tunnel, turn in whiskers to DEF, note
to dwarf - rinse and repeat 20 times, should
get you to amiable with rogues, indifferent to
ALL freeport merchants and even a little more Militia
faction to ruin afterwards :)

Priests of Marr:
Find Mojax Hikspin at the lake side near the inn in the west commons,
get a wolf form (so he accepts milk),
turn in about 35 stacks of milk, 4 bottles at a time (can do a stack of
four,
that's faster) - voila, the Knights of truth will love you, and the Priests
of Marr went from threateningly up to indifferent for me.
Militia went from dubiously to scowling though...
Ah well - some more mobs to kill


If you want to avoid getting KOS to Militia - probably better
start by turning in all the orc belts you can to a guy
in the militia building, get best possible faction with them
and THEN turn in milk, the gained faction with each quest should
be higher than the lost faction on the other quest.
Just that once you get KOS to Militia you cannot do the
belt quest again.

Have fun,
