Subject: What about a Soloer's server?

     The way EQ has been set up it has been geared towards  talentless and
cowardly grouping techniques.  Six players stand in a place where they can
easily run away and single pull mobs that they all beat down with very little
risk of taking damage much less suffering a death and EQ actually rewards this
with extra exp.  I've always found this style of play to be the ultimate in
boring and have often wondered why the style of play that is most difficult and
requires the most amount of strategy(soloing) is penalized with less exp?? 
Maybe they could start a server where players would be required to solo, no
grouping allowed.  Now that would be a challenge.
