My Dark elf Shadowknight, is infact KOS there, You will want
an invis for passing the newbie area guards, and then you
should be fine.  After killing many many kobolds i am sure
you can bank etc.  I have heard of wood elf druids do it it,
I am sure you need less faction than they due, espicially if
the ogres worship Cazic.  I think I read, they start at
higher faction because of deity.
