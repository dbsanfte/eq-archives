In the WoW bitcher's defense... for some of them the 'roughs' have been 
going on every day since middle of December.

Hell a little down time doesn't bother me much. FFXI had  a monster 
patch from hell in the last few months, that due to overloading their 
network with what was at ISDN speeds a 4-6 hour patch, turned into an 18 
hour plus nightmare. I got a bit peeved when that happened on my main 
extra-play day (my day off, and because of their Japanese centric setup 
the patches start around 10am my time) but after fiddling with it an 
hour or so I went off and played HL2 deathmatch for the afternoon.

I wasn't crawling around on the boards yelling for dev blood...

But it's not every night.

Our linkshell (guild) shares a teamspeak server with a WoW guild. 
Sometimes I'll bounce over to their chat channels and listen. It's sad 
when they have a main server and two backup servers for doing 'guild get 
together and do things night' and can't get on any of them.

Actually, one of the reasons I wish they'd get their damn act together 
is every time the boot half their customers Allakhazam goes to hell 
because his database/web servers are not up to the load of 300000 pissed 
off WoW players logging onto his site to bitch and look up quests during 
downtime.

Now if you will excuse me I have 5 hours till work and no sleep yet this 
eve. If I was incomprehensible... well.
