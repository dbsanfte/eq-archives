Looking thru the FAQ I see the following workup on the 'Zerker.  I wrote 
this myself, its been a long time since I played a berserker though, and 
probably 7+ months since I played EQ at all.  I think I topped out at 56 
or so, so I really wasn't an expert at the class even when 65 was the 
top end of the game.

Look thru there, there's lots of "currently" and "unfinished" to them; I 
was wondering if A) SOE ever "finished" the class up or B) if I was 
wrong, writing from a limited viewpoint, and there was really more to 
the high end 'Zerker than was apparant to me at the time

========================================================================

Berserker

Traditional duty: melee damage.  Other roles: snarer, caster interrupt, 
ghetto slows, backup tank.  A decent solo class, berserkers have 
moderately good DPS, and get enough HP, AC, and avoidance to be a good 
off-tank.  They can serve as primary tank against mobs that are 
stunnable.  Their value on a raid is currently minimal, where they are 
mostly just DPS and there are classes that out-DPS them.

Berserkers have no mana bar to worry about, but instead fuel their 
abilities by using up "basic axe components", which are cheaply 
available from their vendors.  The resulting axes can stun, snare, or 
"jolt" a mob.  (Like the level 51 ranger spell of that name, jolt 
reduces the degree to which a mob hates you.)  All share a single 
12-second timer, and are short duration, but the absence of a mana bar 
means they can be used nearly indefinitely as long as supplies hold out 
(which could mean over 100 hours of continuous use), and all take effect 
instantly.

Berserkers solo fairly well as long as they can single pull; the key 
ability is the stun, which should be used constantly on non-casters in 
order to slow their damage (on casters it may be held in reserve to stop 
their spells); adds won't be stunned and thus will do full damage.  In 
groups, stun use can easily overwhelm an unskilled tank's ability to 
hold aggro; again this is the 'zerker's key contribution, so the 'zerker 
and tank should find a way to work with this.  The use of stun as an 
aggro producer allows the berserker to hold aggro fairly well if in the 
position of main tank.  Berserkers should maximize their defensive 
skills either by soloing or serving as MT, as they will be thrust into 
the "punching bag" position with some frequency throughout their career.

Berserkers consider themselves an "unfinished" class; the newest class 
in the game, it seems to most that they are lacking features which would 
make them desirable in the higher levels.  Up into the high 50s this 
isn't an issue for a non raider; the berserker's position as a "medium 
tank" capable of both high DPS (for a primary tank) and good damage 
soaking (for a light tank) makes them flexible and enjoyable to play, 
and the fact that they have a short list of special abilities instead of 
a spellbook full of options should make them easy to learn and to play, 
even for a novice EQ player.
