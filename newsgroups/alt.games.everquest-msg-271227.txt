To be a provisioner you would have to be lvl 20 or above so I assume you are 
a craftsmen, lvl 19.

The cooking skill is broken atm in that you dont get skill ups during the 
process by using the appropriate trade buffs ( you do use them correct ?). 
Only a chance for a skill up for finishing the product.

This problem is fixed on test and supposed to go in with the patch next 
week.
