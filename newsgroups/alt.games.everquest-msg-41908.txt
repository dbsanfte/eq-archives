Thanks, Richard.

Actually, IIRC the :p was after the first paragraph I 
wrote, yes?  After I said "didn't you know, it only 
matters when..." bit?  That :p was meant to imply a sort 
of 'tongue in cheek' attitude.

As for the :/, it was meant as it looks - I have NO idea 
how to describe the facial expression, though - y'know, 
when you smile but don't, because something is true but 
not especially a laughable idea?  When you pull up one 
side of your mouth .. I dunno. I can't describe it - 
which is why I used the emoticon that I and my friends 
use to imply it.

And FWIW, I've seen huge flamewars broken out over *what 
an emoticon means*.  Needless to say, not much got 
solved.
