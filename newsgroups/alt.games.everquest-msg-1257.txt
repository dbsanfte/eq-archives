I wouldn't talk about combatting misinformation and not being an expert at
the same time...to further absolve the misinformation:


: Sneak and hide are skills.  Hide is more effective but, obviously, you
: can't move around.  Bard gets sneak and hide but the skill caps are so
: low that it is almost useless after some early level.  I think the cap

Skill caps are not the issue.  A bard moves with both sneak and hide on, and
hide will be turned off automaticly.  Skill checks on hide and sneak ONLY
determine if you began sneaking or began hiding.

: better than invis, itu, camouflage line, etc.  By "better" I mean, at
: skill 180+, 1) it works against both live and dead, 2) it is more

Rogue's sneak+hide ALWAYS works against both live and undead assuming the
skill check didn't fail.  Skill level makes no differance. 

: invisibility spell.  For example, revultant rats, who sometimes see
: through invis and sometimes don't, never see through rogue sneak.

Revs *can* see through sneak hide, albeit very very rarely.  I have no
informaion concerning how much more often a rat may see through invis than
sneak+hide, if any more often at all.

: others, 2) it is a skill with reset time, and 3) rate of movement

The reset time isn't a drawback really.  Assuming Sneak+hide has been
engaged for 10 seconds, it can be INSTANTLY re-enganged after turning it
off.  IMO, this is again better than invis spells.
