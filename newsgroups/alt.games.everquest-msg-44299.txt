Using the 'F' word is considered the height of unprofessional and immature
journalism.  My broadcasting and journalism professors all warned us to drop
the habit of using it completely...even in our private lives.  That way, if
you were ever in a situation where you were in front of a mic or camera you
didn't know was live, you'd avoid causing yourself embarrassment and
unemployment.

Journalism and broadcasting are very stressful occupations, and if you're in
the habit of using that word in your private everyday life, then it's only a
matter of time before you slip and use it on the air.  Then you start
looking for a new career.

Unfortunately, I've noticed it popping up more and more in semi-professional
web and magazine publications.  The young bucks out there haven't learned
enough about professionalism to realize that open use of the 'F' word in
publishing is a no-no.  They don't realize that instead of showing their
'gritty, real-life' approach to journalism, it merely shows their
immaturity, limited creativity, and lack of self-control.

The fact that it was used in an alleged quote of a magazine article throws
up red flags....little hints that just maybe that isn't really what the
magazine printed.
