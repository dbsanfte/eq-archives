You say tomato, he says tomato...er, wait...ah, nevermind. Anyway,
since we are required to guess at the underlying point to your post,
I'm afraid you will just have to suffer the flames of any incorrect
assumptions.

That said, and *assuming* you were merely looking for tips, all I can
say is that while my main level 27 monk has also experienced these
butt-whoopin's from should-be-dead mobs, thereby losing levels, I'm
sure it only gets worse soloing at your levels. I suppose the key will
be finding the right zone for it.

Wish I could be of more help.
