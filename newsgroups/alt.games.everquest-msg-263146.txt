"Not worth it" would be a better claim. As in a 911 Turbo isn't that 
much faster than a 911 Carrera but costs 40% more... is it worth it? 

The turbo is faster, and it would be nuts to call it the 'cheapo' 
version. But its not *that* much faster.

So... the Ultra version is 'crap' because its already overclocked... so 
you can't overclock it... because its been overclocked by the maker, and 
they'll support it at the higher speed? Sounds like a 'good thing' to 
me.
