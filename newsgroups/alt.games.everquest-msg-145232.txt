I have started a Shaman recently and was wondering if Alchemy is worth
training in.
After checking a few of the sites on the subject I have seen that the prices
for creating most of the potions is huge compared to the effects they grant.
Even the very highest level stuff seems fairly pointless for the amount of
time and expense involved in making it.
Is there any point in practicing alchemy past the sow potion stage?
Does anyone buy any of the other types of potions?
