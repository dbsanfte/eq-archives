If you like games were you injure something, try these:

    http://jet.ro/dismount/

These aren't flash games...they are 3D models with pretty good anatomy and
physics.

In one, you set up a guy in a truck, and set the parameters (velocity,
ramps, distance), and then the truck goes and has an accident, and it nicely
models the resultant actions on the driver.  Goal is to cause as much injury
as possible (best seems to be if you can get him to be thrown out and take a
massive head injury and then have the truck roll over him, and then tip over
and land on him).  In the other, you knock someone down the stairs, again
trying to cause maximal injury.

If anyone is looking to go all the way with the "injure someone/something
for points" genre, may I suggest someone write a "Passion of the Christ"
game?  Goal is to inflict as much injury as possible on Jesus.  I think that
would top all of these for true tastelessness.  I'm not going to even think
of doing it, because I don't want to go straight to hell.  Yes, I'm an
atheist, but that would be so bad I think it would cause God to
spontaneously come into existence just to punish the author. :-)
