However, the best part of this old story is that so many of us have read it and
loved it that we all know about it and it only takes one /ooc question to get
the whole thing going...  LOL

Example of this is recently, while hunting in The Overthere, someone did an
/ooc asking about Burning Woods.  Not being able to resist, I did /ooc "Don't
you mean Burned Woods?"  Someone else immediately picked up on it and said /ooc
"I hear it is off of WC this week"  etc...

The zone went on with this for about 10 minutes.  I know that a lot of people
are aggrivated by /ooc meaningless prattle, but this time it was the majority
of the zone and we were having a blast.  

There are just certain things among the EQ community that will always bring a
smile to our faces...  This story is one.  The Waist Down Fist is another.... 
hehe
