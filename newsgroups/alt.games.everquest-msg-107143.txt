I might port a poerson for free for a CR, but I will never assume that a
person is actually gonna pay me after a cr. Why? Because Ive been ripped off
before and I dont feel like being ripped off anymore. Most of the people
shouting for a port for CR tend to be whining newbies (I know from being a
druid), so you tend to get yourself lumped in with this group, even if you
are paying.

Get the money out of the bank first, say how much your paying in /auction up
front, and dont mention CR, and chances are you wont get flamed.
