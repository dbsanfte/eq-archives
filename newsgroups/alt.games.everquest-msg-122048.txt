As some have mentioned.  If you have to ask and wish for the precise and
accurate answer to be given to you, I would then have to highly suggest just
purchasing a new video card with the overclocking done for you, however,
this one comes with a warrantee.

Try www.newegg.com  then get yourself a Gainward/Expertcard GeForce3 Ti200.
If you decide to think of "upgrading" from that one I just recommended,
think twice if a GeForce4 MX anything pops into your mind.  ALL the GeForce4
MX models are really just glorified GeForce 2's.  Same GPU, different name.
