I was trying to bring my tank friend and me, the cleric, to a Tizmak
camp.  For some reason, I got lost but finally jumped down on a couple
of Tizmaks who then attacked me.  While we were finishing off the
second one, someone comes up and says they are camping this cave.  I
apologized and said they jumped me (I hadn't seen the other guy at
first otherwise would have asked if he wanted them).  He said np, and
my friend and I went to sit outside the cave I was trying to find.
Much later, another group moves in next to ours.  We basically had
been fighting the spawns outside and  the spawns just inside the cave,
because that's all our group of 3 could handle.  The other group seems
to be taking some of the outside spawns.  Basically, they don't say
anything to us about their intentions.. So say "We were camping this
area."  Eventually one replies "Sorry, I didn't know this whole cavern
was yours."  Np, we can share, but why the attitude?  I don't know the
area very well so didn't know how many spawns there are.  Otherwise, I
would have kept quiet like I should have anyways.   Reminds me of when
as a young cleric I cast a calm spell at an apparently uncamped
campground to help break the spawn.  A rogue, who had been hiding, got
on my case.  
My fault for not doing a camp check but I think it instilled in me to
be protective of things I'm camping.  

Now another story.  My druid was in Shadeweaver's Thicket, with
roleplay and anon off.  I was collecting silks for the Rallic Pack
quest.  A level 1 sends me a tell "Oh please say you can port."  I
replied "I'm sorry, I can't right now".  He replies, "Thanks for
shrugging me off, I hope you die."  Um, ok, I was bound in Katta
Castellum and the port to Nexus takes awhile.  Who knows how long it
would take to get back to the zone.  I guess I should have replied I
would port  later on when I'm ready, but really, is it my obligation
to port people?

Most of these incidents make me think I'm a rather rude, inconsiderate
player to generate these kinds of responses and worry that my
reputation is tarnished. Keep my mouth shut and go roleplay  is the
way to go.  And wish everyone including myself would assume players
have the best of intentions until proven otherwise.   Just
disappointed, was hoping my cleric would fare better than my druid but
I guess not.
