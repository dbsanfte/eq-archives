In Kael u will find drops in:

1.) Bank area all types of armor (medium drop rate like 1 per hour).
2.) Arena all types or armor (better drop like 1 per 30minutes). You dont
need to kill PoZ and named. They only drop quest items and eqipment
/snicker.
3.) Plate cycle. A part of the ring quest. Used to yield about 1 to 2 drops
per cycle, meaning per 10 minutes. That got nerfed big time and you are
happy to reach arena drop rate nowadays. But still ONLY plate drops there.
4.) Every mob in Kael (not named) has a chance to randomlyï¿½drop any armor
piece.

You can do Arena, Bank and Plate cycle with a 3 to 4 group raid which just
needs a good tank, a good cleric and a good shaman (55 to 60). The rest of
the raid can be from 45 and higher. No problem. Kael is fairly easy. Pull
singles, let all assist MA and u will be fine.



Halls of testing is a completely different story.

HoT is located in the east wing of ToV (Temple of Veeshan) in WW (Western
Wastes). All mobs are KOS and lvl60 and higher. The wurms, which have best
drop rate, mostly AoE. If you are not capable to crawl HoT you will fight at
entrance and that requires very much discipline and knowledge of the rules
from all raiders (ARGH WHO OPENED THE DOOR????? .....Zemm hits you for 380
points of damage :p). Minimum level for HoT should be 55 at least for groups
1 to 3 (honestly: below 55 characters dont contribute much to a HoT raid but
leechin healer mana). Additionally resists are crucial for HoT as for all
dragon fights. One AE resist song Bard is a REAL help there.
You basically need a solid tank, a puller who knows what he is doin, a malo
mage, a KEI chanter to speed up mana regen is nearly mandatory, a good
cleric with backup healers, a shaman and a AE bard. If you get such a team
assembeled (best all 60plus), the rest of the raid just needs to deal out
damage, assist MA at max melee range and dont sit on incomming mobs and you
are fine there. (just dont try using KOS cov people, do not open the door
while fighting and let casters use a wall for AoE protection).

Btw my recommendation for cleric armor:
1. get hate armor (helm, legs and BP are indeed good).....lvl46 to 52
2. get thurg/pog armor.........lvl48 to 55
3. upgrade to SS armor........lvl55 to 60
