Yes. You seemed to miss the 'first strike' portion of my response. If they
get a darkness spell off they are then kiting you.

Works great for PvM too.

If something works well in PvP it also works well in PvM with few
exceptions.

Go to any necro site and you will find a lot of them open with darkness.
UnSoW'd you can move away, lay your other DOTs and fear the target before
you are your pet even gets touched.

Or for that matter, just do the no brainer send the pet in and start firing
off spells. Just make sure you do the darkness before you fear or you will
be getting a lot of out of range messages.

In a group there is virtually no need for a 14 minute snare. Waste of mana
in my experience.
