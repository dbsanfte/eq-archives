Yeah, the gnome at the SRo Adventure camp provides this refund service and
it's the basis upon which people have been selling their Adventure points.
Purchase any non-lore augment from any shop and then sell them to an AP
buyer for the going price of 70-80p per AP. The buyer then returns the
augments to the gnomes to complete the transaction. Was a pretty common
activity on FV when I left a few months ago.
