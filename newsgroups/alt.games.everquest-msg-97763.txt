All depends on the class you are fighting. if you are fighting melee
people use the earth pet, DS it, and debuff the melee person with
the Malise line. Hope that root sticks so that you can cast. All depends
on the rules in a duel but definitely try to have SoW or jboots and
run the hell away from them, let them chase you while the pet beats
on them. Use fast nukes and no rain spells, people are smart
enough to run out of the AE.

For Casters get the Air pet out, and your resist gear on.

If you have time ahead of time try and get some splitpaw
whips for your pet.

If you are dueling another pet class, send your pet after the
caster and try and nuke their pet with your summoned line
of spells.

It 'may' increase your pet's AC but not its hit points.
Jury is still out on whether the summoned armor does
anything for pets. My personal feeling is that is does add
a few AC.
