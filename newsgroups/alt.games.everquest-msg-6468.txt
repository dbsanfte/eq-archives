Hmm..never once did I say it was a male/female thing...in fact I believe I
said that rape was just as an emotional event for males as well as females.
And I <also> believe I said I would react the same way to someone who uses
the word "niggar" just because that's the way they talk "down here."  Tell
me...where does sex come into that?  No one but you is making this into a
gender thing.
