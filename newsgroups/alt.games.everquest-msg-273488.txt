It's really not as complicated as it sounds. You won't die if IVU
drops since most of the mobs you have to get through are in their 40s
and won't be bunched together. You can usually get to a safe spot if
you see your IVU  fading and if not you might have to kill a mob or
two before heading on. At 65, I don't think you even need to use a
regular invis past the golems, you can hug the wall and not get agro.
So IVU to the golems, run to shop and IVU through the shop to the
dropoff. Then you pretty much have to start fighting since that
roaming hand can see through IVU. 

Once there, any 65 can pull singles. Not sure whether it's worth going
to these days, the days when a 2 or 3 person group could make 10-15k
an hour there were over when GoD came out with decent tradeable gloves
for chain and plate wearers.
