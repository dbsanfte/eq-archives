I would suggest So. Karana to Splitpaw
I'm 28 paladins and in groups of 3-4 outside the infected tunnels, we can
rack up xp with little risk and its reasonably fun, though like goblins,
once you've mashed 100...

At higher levels or when bored, zone into the infected tunnels themselves
for train excitement and higher levels mobs.
