Yeh, I've heard two things,

1. aggro is based on the max potential unmodified damage of a nuke - so
even if you do 2 points of damage with a 2700 max nuke, it's 2700 points of
aggro.  But, if you do 5600 with it, it's still on 2700 points of aggro.

2. aggro is based off the damage you do up to the max of the spell, crits
don't count any higher.

Neither time did anyone say what effect Improved Damage might have.

After playing a wizard to 65 and a mage to 63, I can't confirm if either of
those are true, because there's just so much going on in the fights, when I
get aggro I can't always determine the cause.

If I put my hand on my heart and took a gut feeling, I don't _think_ I've
had aggro more often from crits than not, but then most often you're not
critting, so ..............
