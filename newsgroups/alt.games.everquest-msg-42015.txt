He's 100% right here, you know. I hope the responsible parties know
just how badly they messed up. I'd be surprised to see anything like

together. And now they have the whole world against them.

Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for I 
may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either. Leave me the hell alone.
