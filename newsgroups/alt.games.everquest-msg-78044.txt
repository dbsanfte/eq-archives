No, not to me at 55 they were not.
Fire elementals seemed to be the first to get kos to me, but I think
it was because I killed a boss of theirs named "inferno." All of the
rest are still only glower dubious after much killing and the dubious
ones just stand there but the fire elementals jump me now.

Unless you kill a boss you'll probably be amiable with the people in
the tower before you are kos to the elmentals.
