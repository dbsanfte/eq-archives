I am neither afraid nor ashamed.  I was taught to be polite to people.
If someone says hello (hail) to me, I feel I ought to reply.  It's
called manners.  You may have heard of them.

Since virtually everyone who runs up to me and hails me wants me to
spend spend an inordinate amount of mana making their lives easier
while making mine more difficult, I find it easier to simply get out
of the area as quickly as poosible.  It really isn't any different
from going anon or roleplay.  I could simply be rude as you patently
are.  Not my style :)

As an aside, what really bugs me are the people who tell me, "hi."
These are people I've never heard of in my whole bloody life telling
me "hi."  What am I supposed to do, say hi back?  I don't know you,
chances are good to excellent you're a moron.  Don't tell me fucking
"hi," tell me what you want.
