While this is true, I'd personally avoid all future attempts to get me 
into a beta test if I found out that beta testers were being incinerated 
while testing your software.

Now if it was merely the characters played by the beta testers who were 
incinerated, I'd be willing to chalk up such things to the working out 
of software bugs.

But killing players, well, that tends to prevent them from ever buying 
the game, or filing their beta test reports in a timely fashion.

I wonder how he killed them, poisoned random mountain dew cans, or did 
he put a bullet in their heads if they insisted on talking OOC?

I mean, if he was a really good DM and you were only likely to get dead 
if you violated clearly understood social norms, thats one thing, but 
the random poisoning plan just to keep up the body count, well, I'm not 
-that- desperate for a game.  I'll just stay home and play EQ.
