I'm about 1/2 way through 35 and I've been in Crystal Caverns since very 
early 
in 34. The experience can be just insane - in a full group, pulling 
constantly 
I was able to get a full yellow per hour in level 34. This is amazing 
considering we were just fighting blues, with the occasional higher mob. The 
spiders and terrors are both great exp. Level 35 has been touch and go - got 
2 
yellows pretty easily over the weekend. Since then it's been a struggle to 
get 
the next yellow. It can be hard getting into a group - even harder to get in 
a 
good group. Limited camps, and limited number of players in the zone. Loot 
can 
be amazing, although I've yet to win the roll on something exciting like a 
crystal grinder or BCR. I've gotten a few gems worth 30-40pp, and a 
foreman's 
skullcap.

I don't know if I'd really "recommend" it as the trains can be kinda scary, 
and a good puller makes ALL the difference. You don't want to pull terrors 
if 
you don't know what you are doing (that was me, the first time I tried it). 
I 
think you have to have an SK or monk to pull terrors once you clear the 
static 
spawns on the platform and in the hallway. On the other hand, the exp should 
*easily* get me to 38 or 39, if I can bear to be in the same place for that 
long.

I'm learning a lot there.. and not just about pulling. Learning how a 
balanced 
group is almost essential, although did pretty well on Monday night with no 
healer in 2 different groups. Mobs hit HARD.. 80-100pts easily. Timing 
spawns 
is a good idea - that way you don't get ugly pulls. Learning that experience 
rezzes are a fact of life now.

My greatest frustration is feeling like I "have" to group. Apparently I 
could 
go solo golra's in TD, but that's awfully far away. Up until level 33 or so, 
I 
enjoyed the fact that I could group when I wanted, or solo for solid exp. I 
blew through 30 in no time soloing. But things sure have changed! :-)

Anyhow, I'm bound in Thurgadin and plan on staying in Velious at least until 
40. I can't stand the thought of another minute in OT (or LOIO for that 
matter).. my druid is level 14 and she's going to level up without setting 
foot on Kunark if it kills me! :-)
