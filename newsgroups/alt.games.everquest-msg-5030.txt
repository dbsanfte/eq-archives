Yeah guess so, dont really like it though, I wish they could make it so that
the full windowed mode could have higher resolution on it withouth having to
shrink the whole thing down, as it stands now if I leave same screen
resolution off and switch between modes my monitor will flicker for a few
seconds and its really annoying.
