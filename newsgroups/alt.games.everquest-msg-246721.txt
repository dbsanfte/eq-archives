Now if you re-read the thread you will know that I was replying to a
wild assertion from Dark Tyger.  So before we get into a discussion
about that have another look at what I said and the context in which it
was posted.

True in the past not now.

The 4200 or 4600 are not modern cards .. in fact they are now 2
generations old.

I agree with this comment.

We will see how the implementation goes .. I am betting they will get
it wrong like they have got everything wrong lately.

Now interesting that you accuse me of being a fanboi or of ati
shilling.  Why don't you do a search on my name with nvidia alongside
it in Google groups.

To save you a little time ... I setup the original FAQ on the Nvidia
TNT1 on the Creative website.  I received one of the very first GeForce
sample cards (ran like the clappers) for my work, from Bill Ball, at
Creative.

Replaced it with a GeForce 3 card and then left Nvidia to use ATI cards
(I still have my GeForce 3 in my third computer).  I have borrowed the
4 series cards and the 5 series cards from friends to do testing with.
The 4 series cards were very good in their time .. in fact, the 4200
was probably the best card that Nvidia has ever produced.

That said the GeForce 4 series is now 2 years old and in terms of
computer hardware is old (the first variants came out on April 2002).

Do I like the Radeon cards hell yes .. they do not have driver problems
now ... they are much better cards than Nvidia's current crop and I do
mean much better.

Will this change in the future, maybe ... let's hope that the
competition between the 2 brands hots up because that will benefit us
as consumers.

With the current pricing on the Radeon cards it is madness not to get
one if you can afford it and the DX9 support is there, unlike the
Nvidia cards.
