I've actually just bought a Dell, very similar system, and am quite happy
with it.
I would also agree with Khosh - go for the Turtle Beach (or the SB Audigy2 -
it's only
$10 more than the TB card - the sound on mine is fantastic!)
If you're heavily into gaming you may also wish to upgrade the hard drive to
the 80
or 120 gig volume (at least I do - I don't like to uninstall once I've done
playing.)
