That's pretty funny, considering that whenever our guild is talking
about raids and higher level equipment, spells, whatever, I'll usually
say "wait, I got a couple friends in uber guilds, lemme ask them",
then go ask in AGE and basically hope for a response from either Meem,
Ben, Cel, or Graeme :)

But then, to me, anybody who can successfully do Fear is uber ;p
