Serious bummer, it was charming...beats the hell out of american 
detective shows...I have a friend who is a provate detective and 
he complains that he never gets offers of sex to let someone get 
away with something [he deals with industrial espianage.]

I wouldnt mind seeing the whole series, and even the original if 
it was considered better than the remake!

What was the show in the 70s where a woman was having an affair, 
and she had a mini that had the british ensign painted on it? 
That was interesting, and very different from the way american TV 
would have treated it.

[actually, going by the shows that americans have *borrowed* from 
over there we cant remake a show for crap=\]
