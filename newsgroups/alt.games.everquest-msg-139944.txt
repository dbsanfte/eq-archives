Try http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ if you haven't already. You can create
a profile for your character (can't remember if you need to sign up to a
premium acount for this) and select all the items you currently wear from
the allakhazam database. There is a tool to check for equipment upgrades.
Just select the inventory slot, and it will list a number of items
(restricted by your current money and level if you wish) ranked by whatever
stat is most important to you, although I can't remember seeing *looks* as a
stat. You can click on any item and see the full details including a picture
if someone has uploaded one.
