"""WHY would the puller bring back a train to a
 group, I realize that sometimes it's unintentional, but I've seen
 people pull back 4 or 5 red mobs expecting the group to pull them out
 of it despite the fact that it just ain't gonna happen."""

<<<SNIP>>>

one word: inexperience
(I talk about this in another thread also)

basically it falls into one of two categories -
PANIC: puller is getting mauled, so they head for their group, the only
"safe" place around (hey, there's 4 or 5 of them over there)
OVERCONFIDENCE: we've been taking on trains of blues successfully, we can
handle any train that comes along

I would bet that most people who train like that don't even know the con of
half the train. They con the first one, go to pull it, overpull, don't stop
to con the rest (or to think), and pick one of the two above options.

I'm beginning to think this newsgroup should be mandatory for everyone to
read. From the way it sounds, we know our stuff, it's everyone else that
messing up our fun.

Kinda like being in the Military. I'm in formation, being lectured on
missing formation, while the people that this lecture
--
"Ever stop to think ...
then forget to start again?"

Gortha Strongwill, Dwarven Warrior of 21 seasons
Xorisa, Iksar Monk of 8 seasons
Loniyak, High Elf Magician of 6 seasons

Prexus server

(remove "ao" to email any responses) applies to are missing from the
formation.
