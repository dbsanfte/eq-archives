That groupbonus, how does that work really, does anyone have confirmed how
it works?
Is it and added percentage per groupmember, like in your example 12% for 4
people, would mean
3%/member in the group, is it linear making a 5 person group getting a 15%
groupbonus,Or might the
formula be more complex than that.?
