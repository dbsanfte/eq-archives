With the recent death of 3dFX and the death of Glide along with it(
well outside of EQ and Unreal Tourney Glide had been dead for a year
anyway).  Expect the EQ crew to be fixing its support for D3D and
moving to make that the main video mode for the game.  ( much like
every other game maker over the last 18 months).  

Which should in the end make the support for the Det 3 drivers better.
I only get the flashes at the character screeen.  not within the game.

ALso have you overclocked your card, perhaps stepping it down if you
have might make a difference.  My bro actually likes the graphics on
his tnt2 p3-500 system than his daughters cel-500 voodoo 3.  actually
i should drop a p3 in the cellery system, i bet that would make a big
difference.
