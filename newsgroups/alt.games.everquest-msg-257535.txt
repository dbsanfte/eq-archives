Not just yours - he was the primary source of the *original* D&D
ranger, and therefore the influence is still there, though diluted.

It's worth pointing out Aragorn (and his fellow Dunadain of Arnor)
were referred to repeatedly and often as rangers. And just as
interestingly.. Aragorn almost never uses (and doesn't appear to even
own) a bow through the whole series. And Legolas most closely
resembled a *fighter*. Something to ponder.
