It's funny. I've never played a monk. I have, however, played two
shadowknights. And both times I sweated my way through L20-30 dreaming
of the day I finally get feign death. And when I finally got it...

I retired both shadowknights at L30. There just wasn't anything I was
looking forward to after that.
