    You should. Try joining the CH chain, and see what it's like. One of the
best ways to expose problems is to throw someone in that's never done that
job before, and see where they mess up. It'll also give you some
appreciation for what clerics go through in a raid - you'll see some of the
pressure, and begin to appreciate what they go through to get stuff done.
(Hopefully your guild doesn't actively berate clerics when a raid fails,
like two other big guilds on my server do.)

    When I first joined my guild, my raid experience was low and my CH chain
experience was nil. My first time on a CH chain was our next AoW raid. We
ended up blowing the spawn, and afterwards on the message board the lead
cleric asked "what can we do to improve our end of things?" I was able to
point out a whole boatload of problems I had because I'd never done it
before and the more experienced clerics tend to gloss over tiny things that,
in a serious fight like AoW, become big issues. Like losing the target
you're healing when you click on a bystander that's crowding the spot where
mod rods are dropped, or having a melee open a trade window with you when he
drops his rods, or having direct-damage casters "steal" rods meant for the
CH teams.
