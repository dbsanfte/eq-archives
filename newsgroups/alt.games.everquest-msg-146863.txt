It is true, though. Most banners/popups come from a third party
"service" site subscribes to. The third party decides what ads they're
gonna send through. The most Ala can do is write a complaint to the
guys who provide the ads and hope they pull it. Only other option is
to can the ads completely and go pay-access only.
