I think you did a damn good job. :)

}> The web page is looking fine, barring a few typos. :)
}Where where WHERE?

Boo, I shoulda known I couldn't get away with just saying that. :)

section 2.9, second sentence, 'an instanced dungeons' doesn't work.
same section, last sentence 'the LDoN dungeon drop' should be drops.
2.13a needs a comma after stormhammer in the firs sentence
2.13d FiVi -is- a roleplaying...
second sentence parenthetical, 'more than on character' should be 'one'.
line 4, extends, not extents
2.14 'from other servers from other servers'
3.10 two occurences of 'VV' ?
lower down in 3.10, "Any "line command" has mismatched quotes
3.15 not a typo, but I believe plague rat tails sell for much less than 
     2pp these days
3.15 'out grow' should be one word. comma after "spot". "merchants will 
     play for them"
3.15b 1) another bizarre 'VV'
3.16 the comma in 'location, which' should go away
3.16 second block, "good for a you to know".  There's more than one of me?
3.21 under Roles, "pacify on MOB", how about 'one'?
3.21 under Crowd Control, "Bard's" should be plural, not possessive.
3.21 under Buffer, 'shamans can load a person down', add 'with buffs' 
     maybe? unless we want shamans buffing people with Cripple for some 
     reason?
3.21 under Debuffer, there's a poor lost homeless semicolon
5.1  'expletives', not 'explicatives'
5.2  "if you were to some basic research"
5.5  stray ; before 'Q'
5.5 near the end, "the letter OT" should clearly be plural
7.1 "from the one", or "than the one", not "to the one"
7.3 second sentence is a run-on, make 'The list is endless' separate.
7.3 last sentence, comma after 'game'.

I'll do the other half later.  Some of the commas may be a matter of 
opinion.  Your call. :)
