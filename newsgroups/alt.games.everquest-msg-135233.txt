Or, rather, that _is_ the point.  Druids and necros are what Verant offers
those who, for some reason or another, want a soloing character.  The
drawback is that they aren't as good in raids (which fits the nature of the
character).  The type of player that's meant to play a druid is one that
wants to solo... that's how the character is designed.  To help with
grouping, the druid is given some clerical spells, but that's not the
empahsis of the class.  All this is IMHO, of course.
