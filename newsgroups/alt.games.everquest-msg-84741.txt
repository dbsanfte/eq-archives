Here's the official response I recieved from Verant EQ tech support
regarding the spate of very frequent disconnects I've been having since two
weeks ago.  I am on a cable connection sharing it with one other computer
through a Linksys router.

We do not support the use of firewalls or proxies, including home
cablemodem/dsl NAT routers and other Internet Connection Sharing devices
or software. However, the following information might be helpful if you
need to troubleshoot a connection that utilizes one of those
technologies:

Patch Application:
A TCP connection is initiated from the player's PC (using an arbitrary
port>=1024) to patch.everquest.com, port 7000. There are multiple IP
addresses for the patch.everquest.com clusters, and they may change as
the network demands, so check often using a DNS lookup tool if you
provide a specific firewall rule for patching.

EverQuest client:
UDP datagrams are sent to/from the player's PC (using an arbitrary
port>=1024) from/to one of the EverQuest servers (using an arbitrary
port>=1024).

The EverQuest server IP addresses are on the subnets:
64.37.148.* , 64.37.149.* , 64.37.150.* , 64.37.151.* , 63.241.40.*,
63.241.41.*, 63.241.42.*, and 63.241.43.*
These network blocks may be summarized as 64.37.148.0/22 and
63.241.40.0/22.

Please note that EverQuest opens a random UDP data port from the
player's PC every time EverQuest is run. Thus, the need to have all
ports >= 1024 available.

Ok, can someone please explain this response to me (in little bitty layman's
words).  It seems that they don't support cable modems???!!!   /em boggle
Help!

(not a) Happy Camper
