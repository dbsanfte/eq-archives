Druid snares animal, then charms it, then buffs it up with DS and
haste, dragging it to the pull spot.

One or the other of the pair pulls in a target, roots it at the
pull spot.

Druid sends pet in to tank, and stacks DOTS in on top to speed
things along.

Cleric keeps pet healed up, and uses chain stun to keep it under
control whenever it breaks charm.  If mana is good, MoR on the
victim speeds things along without screwing up aggro... I like to
pull with MoR, in fact.

Either partner can be responsible for rooting and pulling target
mobs.

Its important to avoid contact wherever possible with the pet
when charm breaks, as he's buffed and hasted and was selected for
his killer instincts.

A druid can hunt this way by herself, you say.  Well this is
true.  However, the cleric partner contributes several things;
stuns (which make regaining pet control much simpler and safer)
HP buff, fast heals (druids tend to get slapped around a bit
doing this sort of thing despite their best efforts, I should
know, I've rezed more than a few) more crowd control (a second
rooter, and Atone for the things you wish had never shown their
heads) but best of all, a real working mana efficient heal for
your pet.

If you think keeping a normal MA alive is a challenge for a
druid, try one with 12500 hp, fighting unslowed mobs that quad at
250 a shot.  Every CHeal I cast is landing for full 7500hp value,
I guarantee I'm spending far less mana keeping the pet alive than
a druid would.  This is, in fact, the ideal circumstance for a
cleric, a big badass MA with tons of HP, and no need to rez the
guy if something goes wrong.

I keep the pet on autotarget, since I need to cast heals on him
while he's a pet but stuns on him when he's not, so no one
solution will work well... except for marking him like I do a
raid MA, so hitting the E key targets him every time.

It took us a while to get fully up to speed here, but once we got
it down, we were killing more than twice as many mobs per hour as
the druid had been using charm solo, and thats my definition of a
good duo, more exp each person than they could have gotten
soloing.

Oh, at higher levels its important to note that Tunare's Request
is NOT the spell you want, this is limited to 35- mobs, you need
Call of Karana instead, even though it is a lower level spell.

Sadly, the hammer pet is useless here.  Pet aggro rules at
fault.  The reason a hammer pet can operate at all is because
mobs prefer PC to pet as a target under all but the most extreme
of circumstances.  Sadly, though, only pets on a mob, it seems
that the extreme low HP of the hammer qualify it for LHP
attention right off the mark.  Only time I got a hammer pet to
work was when I had buffed its HP up over the 1000 mark, but
thats another story.
