The problem with this question is that you'd really need the opinion
of someone who has levelled up two necros, one Iksar, one non-Iksar.

I've found the HP regen *incredibly* helpful for a necro. I didn't
particularly notice the racial XP penalty. A level in the low 30s
still took about 75 solo kills.

At 54, I still see a number of people I grouped with on the way up
hovering around 40-45 even though I see them on nearly every day.

A huge advantage Iksar have is proximity to the best XP curve in the
game. FOB 1-12. Kurn's Tower, 13-18. LOIM, 18-28, FM 28-36, OT, 37-42,
DL 43-48, BW, 49-51. All soloable, all but the last two within two
zones of home. VI really improved on their XP camp availability with
Kunark over the Old World.
