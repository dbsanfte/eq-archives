Oh, you still get adds, that hasn't changed. There are far more roamers and 
wanderers in EQ2 and probably more deaths result from this than anything 
else. I hadn't thought about this until reading this post, but I think I've 
died more often in EQ2 recently than I ever did with my Shaman 65 in EQ. 
With the exception of GoD (which was new when I left the game and still 
pretty lethal, this was post nerf), I almost never died unless I got 
summoned or aggro during a raid.
