I'm curious what you base that on.  From my perspective (and I've played
them *all* at least a bit), EQ is without a doubt the most complex of any of
the MMOGs.  A lot of that complexity comes late in the game, though.

I don't think that is a good thing (at least, not always).  There's a
certain breed of people that enjoy every bit of complexity thrown at them,
and a larger segment of the population that likes things more structured and
easier to grasp.

From my (very short, shorter than any other MMOG game I've ever tried) time
in EQ2...  it's a sad and sorry game.  It's like they took EQ, stripped out
every redeeming quality, including any complexity whatsoever as there is
nothing "advanced" about the gameplay at all, and gave it a better graphics
engine.  I freely admit that that is simply my opinion.  As someone who has
played EQ from the beginning, and has enjoyed various other games to one
degree or another, I simply cannot understand why EQ2 has been any sort of
success.  But then, there are people that enjoy being beaten with rubber
hoses too, and I never understood that either.  =)
