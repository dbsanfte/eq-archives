I have my site hosted at www.your-site.com. Runs about $5 per month.
MySQL costs about $4 extra. Includes 25 POP3 email boxes (individually
editable so each user can set their own password), and additional
boxes are fifty cents each. They will register your domain for you,
and they *don't* use Verisign as the registrar (I hate Verisign). 

Currently they've got a special on free setup.

Overall they've been a good hosting service, especially for the price.
The email system went to hell a month or two ago while they switched
over to a new server and software, but that's all fixed now and
running fine.
