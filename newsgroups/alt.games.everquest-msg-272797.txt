    The added zone description is pretty much cut/paste from every other 
release. "New monsters, new treasures, new zones!" This is a given with 
every expansion. The real selling points, since they can't sell the 
zones/loot without spoilers, are the add-ons. Look at the features page for 
Omens of War: http://everquest.station.sony.com/omensofwar/ - any mention of 
the zones? Would you say people are disappointed with the zones in OoW?

    You're saying this with no idea how many zones are being added. If this 
is LoY-sized, you have a point. But if it's OoW sized, do you still think 
the same way?

    You can use this logic for almost anything in the game, though. They've 
given us free zones before - why not now? They've given us new AA's for free 
before - why not now? Tradeskill recipes, spells - both done for free 
before, why make us pay now? You're assuming the size of the expansion 
before the spoilers from Beta come in.

    There's a graphics update in this expansion too. *cough*

    I also remember when the best product they ever made was a bunch of new 
old-world NPCs and five randomized dungeon themes that were as cookie cutter 
as it gets. Very little in the way of tradeskill content, no new AA's, all 
spells were No Drop and many were obsolete for higher-level characters - and 
players loved it dearly. There's more to making an expansion great than just 
"zones".
