Hey Phantom,

I've got a cleric currently at 51, so I'd like that I may be qualified to
field a reply.  I will try to answer some of your questions as best as I
can.

1 - If he is out of mana, at higher levels at least it generally means
everyone in the group with die.  At lower levels (upto and around 25) it is
possible for a cleric to melee fairly well (but not with multi mobs).  A
cleric's duty isn't just to heal, but to be able to put the pieces of the
party back together (rez) when things go wrong.  If he is able to get to a
zone somehow and save his butt, he is able to quickly do the needed resses
on the party and get them fighting again.  If he bailed with 20% > mana,
then he's got problems but fighting a hopeless battle, while may look brave
is NOT a smart thing to do.

2 - Grouping: He's is likely telling the truth, I had no problems finding
groups as a cleric really at any level range.  The exception being when I
hung around Dreadlands for a few levels and there seemed to be an abundance
of clerics a certain times of the day.  People seem to like having health,
clerics can provide.

Without question there are shitty clerics out there, but as a person plays
that class for an amount of time, they quickly learn the dos and don'ts of
the class (much like any I suspect).

This rule comes into play around lvl 25 - 30 and does not change:  If a
cleric is out of mana, they are completely useless to the party
