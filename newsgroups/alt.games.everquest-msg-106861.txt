 Also Netherbian is very very close to a place anyone (even Tanks) 
can bind. The bonuses are found in dungeons and zones that are difficult 
and part of that includes the distance to places where you can bind. 
Risk vs. Reward you know... there's simply not much risk in Netherbian.
Zone outs are nearby and easy to run to, it's not very easy to get lost 
in and you can bind very, very close by, and the pulls are easy. Now 
look at SolB for example, Tanks (non-DE at least) have to bind very far 
away, the whole place is very dangerous and confusing, and the zone is 
nearly always clogged preventing an easy zone out. There's where the 
bonus comes from.... RISK.
