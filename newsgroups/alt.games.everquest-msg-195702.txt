I know how to make buttons that shout "TRAIN!" and stuff like that but how
do you make some of these other buttons? I noticed people using buttons that
call out the spell they are casting or tell what mob is "incoming", or ones
that have other players names in them.

How do you do this? I've been wondering but never get the chance to ask when
I'm playing.
