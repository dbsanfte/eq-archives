Currently, there is no need to max research.  My research is at 171, and
since there are no research-only spells that I'm both missing and actually
give a damn about, there is no need for me to ever spend another point on
it.

PoP might change that (there is some uber loot with +research skill mods,
which would be totally useless unless they plan to introduce some kind of
high level use for the research skill), but until then, I'd hold off.

In general, I'd save training points until you need them.  There are several
good quests in the game now that require things made using several
tradeskills, so if you decide to take up those tradeskills, having a bunch
of points to spend to jumpstart things can be nice.
