Icegrinder is about 1k now, as is the Ice reaver.

EQ Prices and most of the websites are not updated enough or have dud prices
thrown in (whether high or low) that throws them out.
Ask for a PC on that item in somewhere like EC.

I've made more money trading than I ever have adventuring but it takes time
and you may find it boring.

Don't expect to sell something in one hour, my best suggestion is to make a
Mule any character would do, get him to 6th level and palm the stuff onto
him then leave him in EC. Then, when you can't find a group or are not going
to be on long enough to make it worth while looking, log the mule on and auc
in EC (My mule is a 22nd lvl Bard) It may take a few attempts but you'll get
used to the market and prices.
You can ask here for Price Checks but we all play on different servers and
the prices vary from server to server (Bristlebane, where I play, prices are
fair bit higher than other servers, so I hear)
