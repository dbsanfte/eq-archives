I don't have a temporary one, I find with different color's of text, I
can visually filter out certain types of messages in the few zones
where it's a problem (PoK, Bazaar)

So for the perma list:

Loot-whores (is that the right term? Master looter splitting with the
loot?)  hasn't happened as much lately, but for the first couple
months of LDoN, it was kinda regular.

I guess as a sub-classification, idiots that loot everything can find
there way on the list.  Also, people who snag no-drop quest stuff
without asking.  Loot mongers of all kinds generally.

Also, a recent story I shared here about a Wiz who evac'd his party to
North Karana after they wouldn't split  loot when he bailed in the
middle of a LDoN run to get a sandwich.  Class act there.

A couple griefer's and trainer's, but I don't think they play much.
Kinda makes me wish for a /who all ignore command to see if these
idiots still play, or if they could be removed.

After that, nobody makes it much, unless they consistently act like
they're 12.  At least, I hope you're 12, cuz if you're 25+ and act
like that, then I hope you never leave mom's basement.

And lastly, Wood Elves =) 
Seriously.  What isn it with Wood Elves that atracts the morons? And
not just 1 or 2...I mean almost all.  I'm at the point where I think I
should back out of a group if they have more than 1 Wood Elf by the
time I join.  "Sorry, too many Wood Elves" =)
