Opened zones:
at 55:
Crypt of Decay
Plane of Torment
Plane of Valor
Plane of Storms
at 62:
BoT
Halls of Honor

As for getting EPs, I'd check the bazaar for the "important" ones.  They
should only run a couple hundred plat.  Work on getting 62 and access to
BoT and HoH, they drop like candy in there and most people already have
all theirs at that point.  You guys should be able to duo in HoH once
you get 62, which has the occasional spectral drop as well.

Hate.  This seems to be the only place that actually got easier with a
revamp.
