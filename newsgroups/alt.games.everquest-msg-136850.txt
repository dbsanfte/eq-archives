Funny, I took the "lure" as an indication of which angle you were biting

}The "salient" point of my response was my admision that it makes
}no difference if born with it or not.

I may have missed where you said that, but that -is- in fact the issue I 
was hoping to discuss.  I feel it does make a difference, due to the 
nature of the evidence being put forth to support the genetic argument.  I 
was rather hoping you had a new and novel argument against that evidence.

Why do I think it matters?  Because evidence like this has been used a lot 
in the last couple decades to suggest that not just sexuality is genetic, 
but about a zillion other non-physical attributes.  Which leaves us not 
only open to people saying 'oh, I'm sorry I'm an asshole, but it's 
genetic, you know' but also to face a philosophical quandary in which free 
will is subsumed by predestination.

}I purposely injected an 
}element of reluctance/doubt with the word "malarky" to illistrate
}two things.  First, to show that regardless of the root cause,
}the more significant issue was the behaviour and how it is being
}treated in society, which shows that I can objectively look past
}past something that may, or may not be of great emotional importance
}as to concentrate on a more important aspect. Secondly, it provided
}you the same oppertuniety.  i.e. you could have said something like,
}"I believe that we are born with it, however, thats not important
}here, whats important is how we are being accepted in society".

I believe I said that, roughly, a couple times.  Except what do you 
mean, 'we'?  But I was much more interested in discussing the root cause.  
Ahh well, the best-laid plans and all...

}Bottom line (for me) is this:  Chances are slim to none that "I"
}(on anyone else in here) we be able to convince you of my views,
}much like the remote chance that you will be able to do likewise.

Nope, true enough, but it's always fun to try. :)

}I don't "accept" gayness, but with the understanding that the 
}term "accept" in my heart/mind means "is correct" (the whole
}birds-n-bees things, plumbing, cause-n-effect thing).
}I oppose the gays forwarding a notion that a sudden re-definition
}of the word "accept" to include that we should "believe" in our
}hearts and minds that this is Ok, normal, desireable etc.

Both of those statements could use a good dose of grammar.  I think I see 
roughly where you're coming from, though.

(a) You don't personally have to accept gayness, you just have to not 
    discriminate against them.  How hard is that?
(b) I don't see what birds, bees, plumbing, and causality have to do with 
    what activities a person should enjoy.  Birds and bees don't go 
    bowling, either.  And part of the point might be to enjoy a 
    variation on the cause while avoiding the effect.
(c) This is not a sudden re-definition, our society seems to have been 
    working on it for quite some time now.  At least as long as I've been 
    alive, arguably much longer.  The fact that progress is being made 
    does not make it 'sudden'
(d) It is not just 'the gays' forwarding such notions.  I may as well come 
    out of the closet with my heterosexuality... :) I support them.

}I'll go to the nth degree to "tollerate" gays, and would never hurt
}one, condone hurting one, alienate a personal friend because of it.
}However, I would *never* go to bat and defend (even my best friend)
}a gay who is getting ridiculed in public.  I would go to bat if
}he was getting haressed at work over it (although I would go on 
}to explain to him that he has no business bringing "sexual preference"
}up at the workplace in the first place. (pictures on desk or not).

I hate to say it, but I'm glad you aren't my best friend.

}I understand that the term "marrage" is a term that describes the
}union between a man and woman and not open for re-definition.

All terms are open for redefinition.  That's how languages evolve.  

}I don't think it is fair to bestow upon corporations the burdon
}of having now to re-evaluate having to re-define the term marrage
}to determine who gets benefits, and who doesn't. 

It's amazing, then, how many corporations are doing that all by themselves 
for some reason... It would be nice if we could all agree on one term, 
though, so we don't need different forms for spouses, domestic partners, 
cohabitating lifemates, blah blah blah.  Just give it up and call it all 
marriage, ok?

}How would such
}notion be fair to thoes who may want to, say, marry their sister
}or brother ?  You laugh, but selfish to think otherwise...

Dunno, I hear it's legal and commonplace in Brazil.

}Further, and quite possibly my fault, as I leave this debate, I
}still don't have a "clear" picture of exactally what the other 
}side wants.  I mean, I do "kinda" know what they want, but
}it appears somewhat foggy.  

Go with the kinda, it's bound to be a good start.  

}I'm getting the feeling that they
}are wanting unamious public acceptance of this abnormality
}such to create a situation whereby no one would be allowed
}to crack a gay joke, make a smirk as a gay person, etc. etc.

Would you like to hear some good breeder jokes? :) I think as long as it's 
understood that they can smirk right back at ya, that shouldn't be too 
much of a problem... :)
