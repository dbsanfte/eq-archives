Twinking?  Well, there will always be anti-twinking fanatics but most folks
will say "Hey, you earned it?  Do with it what you want."

Though I do agree that anyone who is twinked to the hilt before level 6 (the
magic level where stuff doesn't disappear if you lose your corpse for more
than 30 minutes) deserve to lose their stuff if they're too stupid to
remember where they died.

And those who are twinked to the hilt who think that NOW they can solo a
level 10 critter at level 5 are too stupid to continue living. :)

Twinking should lessen the number of times you die if you have any brains at
all.
Twinking (or being able to twink) also should lessen the number of critters
the person loots...leaving more loot for those who need that 1 or 2 gold.

On the flipside a twink is slightly less likely to have all their skills
maxed by the time they level...but it shouldn't be by a noticeable amount if
the person is at all bright.
