 You don't need to install the cd in order to use the second account, 
you'll just need to use the code on the game disks to start the new 
account. 

 
You are trying to 2-box on the same machine right?  Then you need to  
make a folder under c://Program Files, name it anything you wish, then 
copy all your EQ files to the new folder. Use the original EQ folder to 
play your first account and the new folder to play the second.  Easiest 
way is to make a copy of the shortcut icon to eq.exe in the new file and 
rename it so you know which is which, put that on your desktop next to 
the icon for the other EQ.  

Some machines can't handle 2 copies of EQ running at the same time. 

Good luck
