Reduces the amount of dammage you take in combat. Note that this is
extremely mob dependant . For each and every mob there will be a range of ac
that is important and another range that isnt .

For instance take for example a rock golem in plane of valour. It might hit
well enough that an ac of 700 or lower might as well be nude while also only
getting the lucky shot in on anything over 1300 ac. Therefore on that
particular mob going from 800 to 900 might considerably reduce the amount of
dammage you take while tanking while going from 600 to 700 does nothing in
particular and going from 1400 to 1800 also does nothing in particular .

To that particularly well designed system they hardcoded some weird stuff to
address the facts that many classes had too much or too little ac for the
effect they actually wanted to provide and to address warriors and other
tanks getting annoyed that the last 10 items they upgraded had no effect on
their tanking ability.

The whole system is rather nastily broken atm. If you are a paladin try and
get an ac of about 20 times your level. If you intend on tanking the biggest
baddest mobs your large guild ever meets get an extra couple of hundred
points. Once you get above that magic number concentrate on hp items and
resistance items rather than ac items.
