Since you use this tatic frequently, maybe you do this already, but if not,
think about putting some delays in there...If  I am stunning casters I
usually cast them individually since the effects dont stack and cast time is
roughly the same.  Generally, Ill wait a few seconds before casting the
second stun and (if I have a third memorized) wait again before
casting...that way they actually stay stunned (assuming they dont get
resisted) and I then have the first stun I cast available again.
