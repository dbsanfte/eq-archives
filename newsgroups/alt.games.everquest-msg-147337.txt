Hmm, here's a plan.

Someone does all other parts of epic except for the swirling pearl.

Cleric does swirling pearl, then gathers the four shards.  Note that these
shards can be gathered for no work at all on MT, I got two of my
four by simply jogging over to spots that were announced in /ooc.
(and a third by a personal tell from someone I'd rezed months
earlier)

Cleric lurks around near warder, waits for RF kill, then ninjaloots
the heart.

Wait for warder repop.. maybe days later, sometime when you
won't be spotted.

Hand in shards.  Leave human Zordak up for someone, combine
heart with pearlescent thingumie to make completed heart.

Done, without having to actually kill Ragefire.  In the meantime,
you took someone elses kill AND spawned a version of zordak
that will be unusable unless someone else wants to similarly spawn
a useless zordak!
