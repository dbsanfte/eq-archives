At the level intended, I found them to be very reliable, the only 
problem with them is that like Skinspikes, over level 35 or so, you need 
dropped parts to make them, however, unlike Skinspikes, the storebought 
version is useless at higher levels.

They do, however, carry in stacks of 100 and bandolier in, so it might 
be worth farming the materials and making a stack or two of the high end 
ones for the various non snaring classes.

The Test server, sadly, has no real bazaar economy, and very frequent 
mini patches which clear out the vendors, so if you want these goodies 
you have to farm them yourself.

However, I've found Siren's Grotto to be very decent cash farming, 
sending in my retired SK I can farm about 2500pp in gems sold to vendor, 
and about 100 DWInks, which my little shaman can turn into another 
2500pp or so in Spirituality IX potions also sold to vendor (less than 
100pp in parts)

I tried farming Seb for Blue Lillies, but got far fewer per hour.  With 
CODecay now a hot zone, I've picked up a couple hundred of these as a 
byproduct of exping/PLing, but again, the actual rate per hour is lower 
than DWInk farming in SG, so if its just money I want (and skillups), 
its back to good old SG.  I haven't tried vendor farming since the HZ 
change, though, its possible now there's a good supply of Blue Lillies 
to be found on the POT vendors, I should look into it!
