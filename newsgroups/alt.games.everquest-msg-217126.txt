Well, I hear the exp is comparable to high end PoP and the drops I've
seen appear to be Elemental quality. You'd just have to treat it as a
2 hour dungeon crawl instead of a LDoN adventure. Nobody I know would
really be worried about the losses showing up on the leaderboard.

Yeah, main reason I'd want a good SK, both for pulling and MT. Warrior
would be nice but all the ones I know are either barely 65 or so well
geared that they don't need the equipment (Fubers).

None of the group I'd like to take would be geared all that well or
have all that many AAs. Would be easier with some friends from Fu,
some of em still enjoy a tough dungeon crawl but that kinda defeats
the purpose, gearing up people that _aren't_ that well equiped.

Heh, the really, really slow part goes without saying. Can a ranger
track the whole dungeon from zone in? Ranger would probably be
preferable to a druid in the group but I don't know any high end
rangers. If people really didn't care about blowing their adventures,
a group could zone in, see how many named were on track and then
always choose to cancel and grab another adventure if nothing was up.
