Yeah, scamming seems to be one of the favorite past time of jerks on
Everquest, and I am sure a lot of you people not only ben scammed, but feel
frustrated about how these guys get away with it.  Or how GMs don't do squat
about it.

But, there are ways to help them get these guys, and you will just have to
try and use some common sense in order to make sure that future scammers
(Especially ones who read this) will be discouraged for ripping you off.

As a buyer of items, always be sure to do the following:

1) Turn off Auction.  Apparently, GMs need reports to see the promise made.
Turning off Auction and getting the person to repeat the proper offer to you
will save you grief when the GM asks you to do a report.  You won't lose it
in the auction spam.

2) As the buyer, don't present the money first, especially if they happen to
be sitting on objects.  Often times such dealers are trying to exploit
something they aren't suppose to...  Be especially aware of people nearby.
Often times, it is best to have a friend with you to avoid things being
grabbed or at least a witness to who may spot the co-scammers.

3) If they promise to give you the item in question on another character, or
give you a bunch of stuff with the item you want in question, cancel the
trade immediately.  If you didn't already know this, items drop into the Gen
Inventory first if you are receiving a bag of stuff.  Make sure your
inventory has room.  GMs will not help you if you have not made sure you had
room in your inventory for the item in question, but they might bust the
scammer for purposely junking the trade.

4) Watch the trader carefully.  Sometimes they will try to do something
tricky, like try and LD or pull away.  If they are anon, they are likely
hiding something, especially if they are naked.  Scammers like to make
disposable characters to scam people, then find a good time to transfer
their ill gotten gains at another time to their real character.

As a Seller, a lot of this applies to you as well.  It is important that you
take exact notes and pay attention.  Most naked sellers aren't serious
sellers or buyers.  While there is a very little chance of getting your
stuff back, it is important to make scammers realize that if they get
caught, their chances of fun is even less than yours because of your loss.
You can make up their loss, but scammers will lose a lot more when they are
caught.
