	*Another* patch.  If they do more rollbacks I'm out.

	And why the hell do they do "scheduled" maintenance on
a Saturday morning for a game system?  It's Saturday everywhere 
they have customers.  When do people play games?

	I'm begining to detect a pattern.  "Whoops, we made a mistake.
Should we stop and correct it now, or allow it to percolate through
the world for two or three days so that we can make sure thousands
of people are unknowingly affected?"  "We need some more maintenance
time.  When do most people use the system?"

	Clearly the technical lead on this project is a BOFH.
