Hmmm, this may sound dreadfully naive but what is happening to my posts (and
those of others perhaps).

For example I posted about "Lesser Succor" and it does not show and yet I
saw Tukka Yoot's response (which was almost immediate) at the time (and I
still see it), also Jason Rochelle's response. My thanks to Tukka Yoot's
response also doesn't show. I am also seeing lots of  "Re:"'s but rarely the
original posts, even though they were posted within the timeframe of the
extent of messages that do appear.

I am using OE 6.00.2600.0000 and I have looked at all the options and can't
see what could be causing it. I'm sure it must be a simple thing. Any ideas?

Also, on a search for help I found a (probably unrelated to this post)
reference to  "To access this functionality, disable "Automatically expand
conversation threads" under Tools | Options | Read."  but this option does
not appear in my version of OE (it does however say "Automatically expand
group messages").

Hmm, well I guess the sensible thing would be to check and see if my OE is
up-to-date, perhaps I'll do that right now. No, that seems ok.
