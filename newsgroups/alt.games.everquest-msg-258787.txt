The reason I mention it explicitly is so that I can point out that it 
conflicts with cast buff haste, and to differentiate it clearly from 
song haste 2).

Many people know that Song Haste stacks with Buff haste... which is only 
partly true, only Song Haste 2) does.  I keep finding myself grouped 
with bards who are steadfastly playing both 1) and 2) despite having a 
higher level chanter haste on... pressed, a couple have explained that 
its to cover us when chanter haste drops... trouble with that theory is 
that it means they are wasting 1/5th (or honestly, 1/3rd, cause they 
aren't the best bards to start with) of their song output in order to 
keep us covered for an event that happens for a few seconds every 9 
minutes or so.  Keep it memmed?  Maybe.  Keep singing it?  Come, do 
something useful!

I"m afraid I have no details, and I'm actually =playing= a berserker. 
I've heard that it stacks with everything, but people hate it so much 
its hardly ever used, and I haven't parsed it while wearing haste item, 
haste buff, and bard singing overhaste, to be able to compare.

Heck, I don't even know what the haste % on it is!

Now thats a Time drop, and its good for a whopping 5% boost to speed...
but who knows whats out there in OOW waiting for us?

Grage, at a mere 36% haste (item), 54 Berzerk, Luclin
Thats 1 level from a 30% buff haste clicky item
Better get xping!
