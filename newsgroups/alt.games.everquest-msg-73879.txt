They'd get calls from all 475,000 users because it was a 1-800 number,
over the tiniest of issues which could be answered by looking at the
EQ faq or boards or asking any other player in game. Well maybe not
all 475,000 but even half of that would be very expensive.

Its kind of what verant once asked somewhere on their board in a
thread long ago. They asked, "would you be willing to spend more like
say 12.95 or 15 bucks (rough paraphrasing here) for a higher degree of
customer service" nearly every person replying said no and in fact
they want that higher degree now for $9.89 per month.

Them running a for profit business means that you are not going to see
a 1-800 number for $9.89 per month. Even at 12 or 15 they'd probably
get so many crank calls from people who left EQ or hate it or can't
play it anymore because of increased system requirements that it would
still not be enough. Really if paying 12.95 per month we'd each be
paying 3 dollars per month for all the other customers and cranks who
call that 1 -800 number even if we did not. Frankly that would prompt
me, and probably a lot of other people, to call that 1 800 number
enough each month to get my 3 dollars worth which would again mean
them taking a loss ;)
