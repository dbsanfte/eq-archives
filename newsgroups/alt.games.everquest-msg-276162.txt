if you plan to do a fresh install of windows to your new setup and then
transfer 'all your crap' from the old HD, most of your installed apps WON'T
work ('cause they were installed to the other windows not this one..). of
course there are some games/apps which do work when transferred like this,
but i doubt EQ2 is such. it all comes down to the registry entries windows
loves so much: if you could all EQ2 related registry entries also, then
maybe..

BUT: if you clone the (contents of the) old HD to the new one, everything
works as before. I've done this about 4 times over (when swapping my HD's to
bigger ones) and it works like a charm. I actually have over two years old
Windows install, which seems incomprehensible to some of my
'pc-technically-challenged' friends who do a full re-install about every
month (poor bastards aren't capable of keeping their setups in working
order.. ;)
