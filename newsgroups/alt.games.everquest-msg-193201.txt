Well, admittedly, since buying EQ, I have not bought very many games.  
OTOH, I used to regularly buy computer games, and keep my computer for 2 to 
3 years with minor upgrades along the way.  Currently, my computer does not 
meet the specs, my processor is too slow, being a mere PIII-800.  That is 
easily remedied by just replacing the processor.
