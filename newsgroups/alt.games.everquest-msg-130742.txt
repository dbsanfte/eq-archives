"Unconventional only begins to describe these ... products, which not only
pushed the early IBM PC to its technical limits, but also broke new ground
in gameplay ideas and execution. You'd be hard pressed to find a more unique
game than ICON in the 1980s, for example: Based on Wagner's Reingold opera
(!), it featured 16-color graphics on a video card that was only technically
capable of 4-colors in graphics mode. The gameplay was real-time, and was
calculated and animated at 60 frames per second. And this was in 1984!"
