You didn't provide much information but I can tell you this much...the
reason it's so slow is because you have an ancient video card gaming-wise.
The oldest card that Verant even mentions on their support page is Voodoo 3.

It looks like you said you tried another card and had nothing but
problems...what card was that?

What is your CPU speed, your RAM amount, your sound card, and your OS?  Does
your motherboard even support an AGP video card?
