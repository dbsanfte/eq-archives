Actually, the price didn't take a nosedive until PoP came out.  Before the
new cultural armor recipes, BDs sold for up to 1k.  After the Cultural Armor
became widely known about, the prices climbed up to 2k.  Now, with PoP, and
more BDs avaialble, or less desire to get them due to new drops from PoP,
BDs have gone down to 500 to 700.
