Much like what I described elsewhere in this thread, except I use
the F9 key with various ctrl/shift modifiers to select specific
cameras.  (My job and other activities often use keys with ctrl/shift
for various commands, so I find it easy to hit such combinations.)
I wouldn't want to use "home" for these, since by default that's used
for resetting the camera angle if I've used page-up/down while in
first person view.

I don't find that the camera angles change unless I've told them to
(using page-up/down).  Maybe you're referring to the way the camera
seems to jump around when in third-person view?  I think what's
happening there is that the camera is set at a fixed direction and
angle of elevation relative to the character, and is always looking
back at the character (who is centered in the screen).  But as the
character moves, obstacles may come between the camera and character,
in which case the camera pulls in past the obstacle so the character
stays visible.  Then as the character moves again, the camera pulls
back once the obstacle is no longer in the way.  And yes, this can
be disconcerting in some terrains; I often wish there were a way
to set a maximum distance on the camera relative to the character.
