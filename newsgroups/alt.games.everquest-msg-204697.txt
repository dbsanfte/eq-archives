 Just to put my 2 cents in, as a Monk I average in the 155-175dps range
on PoP mobs, mob depending. And I'm not sure that is counting procs.
I'll have to check on that. That's with enc haste/avatar. It would
probably be similar with Ranger buffs instead of Avatar. 

 100dps for a monk with 'uber gear' is way too low. It's even too low
for Warriors. I'd put well-equipped warriors at 130dps or more.
