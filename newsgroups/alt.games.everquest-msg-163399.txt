I have been living in Lesser Fay working on the Tunare quests.
Finally got that Necro to pop last night.  Anyway during my time there
I have been foraging morning dew.  Being a trade skiller I almost
never throw anything away so I keep them.  First a wiz in Kelethin is
ooc'ing for Morning Dew.  I give him 3 at the bank and he gives me 41
pp.  Huh?

Last night I spend my running around lesser Fay looking for one more
Ghast heart.  I get a tell  asking me if I would like to do a Quest.
I tell the person I am looking for Hearts but if they need help with
something maybe I could lend a hand.  He then tells me if I can get
him 3 stacks of Morning Dew he will give me a Paw of Oppala.  So
either Morning Dew is really valuable or I am overestimating the value
of the Paw.   I actually tell him I think he is insane.  

3 stacks would take a lifetime to forage since I only had 16 after
about 15 hours RL time in LF.  I told him if I ever got that many I
would gladly give him a tell.  "Thats all I ask."
