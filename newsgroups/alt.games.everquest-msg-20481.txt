I'm sure that there would still be a lot of names that
would be perfectly "legal" that would nonetheless annoy
some people.

So here's my (only partially tongue-in-cheek) proposal to
make *everyone* happy:

Add a command to the game, "/rename".  Any time someone
sees a name that they find annoying, stupid, damaging to
their suspension of disbelief, etc., they type:
    /rename  <stupidname>  <bettername>

(All of this will be handled client-side.)

From there on out, whenever they see that PC, the name
over the PC's head will read <bettername> instead of
<stupidname>.  Tells, shouts, oocs, and auctions from
that person will likewise appear with the name mutated,
as will appearances of that PC on a /who list.

Tells sent to that PC directed to <bettername> will
be translated by the client into tells to <stupidname>
before the message gets sent to the server, etc.

Whaddaya think?  :-)
