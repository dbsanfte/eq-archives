There are lots of ways to get OUT of those zones. There is only one way to
get in, and only wizards can do it. You can substitute a druid or wizard
interchangably if you need evac, but you cannot bring druids on a hate raid
without the wizards.

Drastically? No. But neither is the SoW spell. A variety of different
items, and 4 classes can all increase your running speed. Only wizards can
get to Hate/Air, and only wizards can translocate.

Clerics and Paladins have FAR better hitpoints, FAR better armor, and
access to LoH, Divine Aura, or both. Mages can use CoH in a limited
fashion. Warriors have the best possible ac/hp to survive a corpse drag if
they get seen while invis.

Err, whoops. Brain inserted an "if" before the "your definition". Sorry :)

Pulling singles, and being able to personally deal with adds in a
productive fashion (one that doesn't involve returning to your bind point
involuntarily).

I can count on one hand the number of times I've been ported out of
Sebilis, and that is NOT factoring in the fact that my shaman can gate.
Yes, I've been to Seb a lot. Howling stones is obvious. Kael, ToV, Hate,
Fear, PoG are all raid zones. All classes have uses on (most) raids. This
is a single group desirability function, and doesn't factor in the needs of
30 people.

Feh, shaman pet only tanks slowed things. Anyway, including the pet in the
damage absorb rating would put epic mages higher than almost any class but
warrior, and that doesn't reflect the reality of what happens when a mage
starts taking hits.

> I've been in mid fifties
>groups with no nominal tank at all, using the mage pet as sponge

I was in a Hand group in KC with 57 epic shaman, 55 Epic mage, 2 54 epic
rogues, 53 druid, and 51 wizard. Kicked ass and took names for 6 hours. No
tank, no cleric, no enchanter. I'm deeply familiar with the power of the
epic mage pet. Still doesn't help the mage when something decides to wear
his guts for garters. REALLY doesn't help if the pet is dead, or not
summoned yet, or pathed to some far corner of the world. Also doesn't help
prop his cruddy hp up against AE dragon breath.

But mages do, so it becomes an issue for them.

Malachite is only available in cities. Bone chips are available in 90% of
the zones in the game.

Which doesn't help if you are trying to get back to your body. Necros can
get around that.

No, not relying. Having the option. Necros have it, mages don't.

Ideally. Only seldomly works that way in fact. Necros eat a lot of coffin
costs. Course, they are expected to because everyone "knows" how necros do
nothing but farm FBSSs and rare 51+ spells in skyfire so are rolling in
cash.

You must hunt really profitable places. Even scraping up gems by the
truckload in the iksar necro jail, I consider it a miracle to get more than
200 platinum in 3-4 hours after the split. Most camps yield far, FAR less.
I never rely on group xp hunting for any kind of notable cash. The whole
concept is a joke when I can go to the rathe mountains and kill 4 hill
giants (simultaneously, no quad kiting) and get more.

> Also, I try not

I have only needed my corpse summoned one time when it wasn't a raid
wipeout, and that was the night they added Wuoshi to the WL portal, and his
obscene aggro radius (and ability to see invis) was unknown. All the other
times have been raids. If I never raided (and I don't, now...but I used
to), then the entire summon corpse line becomes utterly meaningless to me.
Doesn't mean it is meaningless to others. And no matter how many of you
there are, how high level you are, what gear you have, and what your
playing skill is...raids will get wiped out. Frequently where coffins are
the only feasible way to get recovered.

Why would you need a coffin if your body is in the EC tunnel?

The only reason my shaman at 58 is not broke is because I enjoy passing the
time farming hill/ice giants. I have no other means of income. I *never*
get saleable item drops (at least, nothing that goes for more than 100
platinum or so, and the time wasted in EC trying to unload the piece of
shit would be far better spent...you guessed it...killing more giants).

Lots of high level people do not have strong guild access, and are
therefore forced to buy most of their 56+ spells. Every penny a lot of them
end up with gets dropped on some farmer.

It is very seldom that I ever see a cleric who symbols anyone but themself
and the main assist. I never, ever ask for symbols myself, barring a real
need for it (ie: dragon raids).

Well, in my experience, adds turn clerics into puddles faster than the
casting time on my chloroblast, unless I get to them first. Course, my
clerics are spoiled, and often complain of boredom in the group because
there isn't any healing for them to do.

My inclination would be that if someone left themself bound in neriak
during a ToV raid, that they should rot there for a while. But that is a
personal issue :)

Cleric offensive ability at level 60 is capped at 175 yet? My 30 rogue is
nearly there in a couple of categories.

And the lack of primary hand damage bonus, which is monumental.

I've never been in a group where anyone said "can't kill, we only have a
SK/Paladin/Monk/Ranger". I've also never seen "group looking for warrior",
it is invariably "group looking for tank".  Hell, in small groups, Monks
and SKs make *WAY* better tanks than warriors most of the time. I can duo
almost anywhere in KC with a monk...I wouldn't dream of doing that with a
warrior. I was lone healer at the guardian in Seb, with an SK as main
assist. Her with lammy and the SK lifetap-proc-imbue spell, plus regrowth,
and I was going out of my mind with boredom because she never needed
healing. Even a dual-bloodpoint warrior couldn't pull that off.

How many necros did you have twitching mana onto you? Quite a few I would
imagine. Or maybe it was necro, cantata, C2, and a flowing thought item. 23
rezzes = 13110 mana, assuming the standard 5% specialization mana
reduction. 20 minutes of unbuffed mana regen = 5000 points, give or take.
That is assuming you did nothing to heal any of them after they popped up.

Cost to stick 23 people = 0 mana.

> Stick could have cut that to perhaps 10 minutes...

Time to Stick 23 people = 5.75 minutes, assuming 15 second cast time on the
stick. Call it 6. That is 14 extra minutes for everyone who got rezzed to
meditate, rebuff, heal, whatever that you would otherwise not have had.

Plus, if you were rezzed yourself up for those 23 people, how long do you
have to sit on your ass before you can cast ANYTHING to bring people back?
A minute or two probably. Stick = loot and go.

Every raid should plan on getting wiped out, or you will be up shit creek

When Shiverbacks in Fear were charmable by charm animal, this was a useful

[snip]

Take your simple situation, and have the second mob beat the living snot
out of the healer because he drew enough aggro, and nobody was occupying
the mob...dead group. Crowd control is not an exersize in damage
efficiency. It is keeping the vulnerable members of the group alive to do
their jobs. Yes, taunting a mob and pulling it away from the group is
probably the least desirable method of doing this, but it still IS a
method, and classes that can safely do this get better ratings than classes
who cannot.

The cleric's time is better served meditating than waiting for those legs.
If you could still sit down, and then stand at the end while clicking an
item, it would be a consideration...but the cleric loses too much
meditation time clicking their legs. Paladins often have little else to do
during downtime, and clicking the helm costs them nothing.

It works as both. Without regrowth, FAR more healing would be necesary.
Cantata fulfills the same function.

Bards slow quite well, thanks.
