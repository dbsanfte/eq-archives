I play a dark elf rogue and just for the heck of it i went into Calibis and
started conning guards.  Ok now i have good faction with the majority of
them.

now would doing the pincers quest or bone chips quest raise my faction
enough so that i may bank in there and raid places like Karnors Castle or
Kaesora without leaving me with no place to bank and shop.

Also does assaulting those two places affect my faction with Neriak in
anyway?
