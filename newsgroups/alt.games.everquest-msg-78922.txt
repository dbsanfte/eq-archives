Oh, you mean this?

http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/conduct.jsp

"THE FOLLOWING ARE THE BASIC RULES OF CONDUCT THAT
GOVERN PLAYER INTERACTION AND ACTIVITY WITHIN EVERQUEST
AND IN THE OFFICIAL EVERQUEST FORUMS. FAILURE TO ACT
RESPONSIBLY AND COMPLY WITH THESE RULES WITHIN EVERQUEST
AND THE OFFICIAL EVERQUEST FORUMS MAY RESULT IN THE
TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT WITHOUT ANY REFUND OF ANY
KIND.

You may not harass or threaten other players.

You may not use any sexually explicit, harmful, threatening, abusive,
defamatory, obscene, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive language."

See?  If he did a /report and /petition, your account is *gone* at the
discretion of the GM.  Assuming you said what you said you did, your
days of playing these characters may be numbered.

BTW, resorting to profanity because another player is playing the
game as intended by the designers would be something I'd attribute
to a 12 year old...
