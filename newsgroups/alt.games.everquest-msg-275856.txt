Either I've been out of it longer than I thought, or I just don't pay
attention to Bard issues (though I worked on a bard for a while as my
main)... but when did they start allowing you to twist bard songs via
macro?  Were people happy about this change?  I always viewed the
frantic button mashing as a vital part of being a bard, and part of
what made it unique.  Obviously the previous poster was unaware of
this change, no need to be deliberately obtuse with the "what button
mashing" comment.  That IDENTIFIED being a bard for years.

Anyway, I guess now bards might actually talk in /gsay. :)  How
fascinating!
