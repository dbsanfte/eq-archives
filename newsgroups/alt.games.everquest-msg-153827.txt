Perhaps at the high end, monks do less damage than
comparably equipped rogues as long as the mob's
back remains predictable.  So lets step back from
that brink  and say "monks do more damage than
rangers and almost as much as rogues" shall we?

Just to make you feel better.

1000 AC that don't matter one HP a minute.  1200 AC is 1200 AC,
and oddly, 2200 AC is still 1200 AC.  This would be the obvious
solution, clean out that AC cap so that there IS a difference, perhaps
by reducing AC effect over all, or better still by removing the
weird little plateau slope plateau shape of AC effectiveness entirely
and just make AC work on an inverse curve (is that what I mean?
such that 100 AC is better than 0 AC, 200 AC is better than 100
AC but not by as much as the 0 to 100 AC improvement, and 300
is better than 200 but not by as much as 200 is better than 100, so
on and so forth.)  Now every class would have a reason to pursue
AC, and yet plate classes would get much better AC results than
non plate classes.

Says who?  The guy taking the damage, or the guy healing the
damage?  I say monks take less actual HP per minute than
any other class.  Their HP bar drops at about the same rate,
sure, but thats because its smaller.  If I'm relying on heals
other than CHeal, though, I don't care about HP bar, I care
about actual HP loss.

How is this "wrong?"  Look, you say they have fewer HP and I say they
have fewer HP... we agree.  Now I add that a very well equipped monk
will have as many HP as an average equipped warrior... and I think
I'm right there.  But thats just an "unless" I added to prevent people
from using that to counter my admission that monks have generally
smaller HP bars.

I didn't say it did.  I'm saying I've healed a lot of them, though,
and a lot of warriors.  And in my experience, barring disciplines
and so forth that are usable for short periods of time I can tell
you that if I'm not going to use Cheal, monks are far and away
the best sponges.  They take less damage per minute, they do
more damage per minute, whats not to love?

Compare to a rogue, who does damage about as well
as a monk (more, less, dunno, but in the ballpark) but takes
damage only slightly better than a wizard.

Compare to a ranger, who makes the rez stick a "keep
equipped" item if he's trying to tank.

Monks, wearing Less armor, doing the same damage
more or less, nonetheless take damage on the order
of a warrior or paladin or SK, certainly better than
a bard or cleric despite their having far better armor
in theory.

Only CHeal, and only on high HP total sponges, breaks this
equation.

Lets do the math.

Monk taking 250 damage per minute with 1000 hp total
Dead in 4 minutes with no heal

Warrrior taking 500 damage per minute with 2000 hp total
Dead in 4 minutes with no heal

Healer with a 250 hp heal


Who is the better sponge?

OK, so the situation isn't quite this drastic.  Monks have
more than half the HP of a comperable warrior, and take
more than half the damage a comperable warrior does.
But the curve works the same way.  If you take less damage
per minute, then anyone but a Chealer is going to find you
easier to keep alive.

With CHeal, things get funny at high end hp totals,
CHeal a warrior  for 5000 hp for 400 mana, versus
a monk for 3000 hp for the same 400 mana... well,
unless the monk was taking less than 3/5ths the
damage per minute the warrior was, you lose efficiency,
even though he's taking less damage per minute.

Of course if Monks get their HP up over 7500 hp
then this won't matter, and if you leave them
at the current better mitigation, then you will
suddenly see them back on the top of the heap
as best sponge.
