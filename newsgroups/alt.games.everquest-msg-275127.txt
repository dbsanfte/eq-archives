Yes I like soloing and I also like grps but quest after quest, main and alt, 
I am stuck LFG night after night.
I am desperately looking for easy going guild at mo.

Quest after quest must have grp or most mobs will be grey when you can 
finally solo.
Many instanced areas require grp - not even given u the chance to explore.

What happens when the game is old and alts and newbies dry up - how can you 
grp if ONLY PLAYER IN ZONE??????.

Elephant training ground
I can solo in there np but can I get in without finding two more players and 
can I find two.

AQ3 I am finally up to this one but what a nightmare trying to find grps.

Darkblade Den
My healer alt has tried for two weeks to find grp for here.

I like so much about the game but it sure gets frustrating.

LFG, waiting for named to spawn, looking for solo mobs, to name but three.
