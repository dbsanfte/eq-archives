Swamp has a ZEM of 75 according to a list I was probably pointed to from 
here.  Only zones lower are The Grey at 65, and LoIO at 60.  Paludal, 
Crushbone, and Befallen are at the top of the list with 160, followed by 
Upper Guk, Kerns Tower, and The Warrens at 150. SolA and Unrest at 130, 
some city zones and Kedge at 125, most of PoP at 119, HoH at 111, more 
cities, Blackburrow, Kaesora, Najena, Runnyeye, Kerra Ridge, and Veksar 
at 100, Qeynos Catacombs at 96, lots of zones at 90 to 80, and just under 
half of all of the zones at 75.
