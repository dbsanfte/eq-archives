Um, no.

Did it ever occur to you that maybe SOE doesn't do it because SOE doesn't
consider the money they'd have the spend to do it worth it in the long run?

I'm sure someone at SOE has done some sort of analysis considering how much
they'd gain overall from pursuing such a course and come to the conclusion
that it wouldn't be worth the money in legal fees.

If it's not a financial consideration, since they can just afford to burn
all that money they'd spend on such an action, why don't they just go ahead
and do it anyway?  How would things change if they lost?  IGE's still going
to be selling plat in EQ either way.
