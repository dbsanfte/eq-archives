    He got it from the ShowEQ folks, who were the first ones to figure out
that the (original) exact formula for raw XP was
ZEMx(group_bonus)x(mob_level)^2. In the original game, all standard zones
got a 75 ZEM, and the dungeons got an 85 ZEM.

    The people that talk about % bonus only do so because one patch message,
when the ZEMs on mostly unused zones was raised, talked about it that way.
But what that patch message didn't say was how good the XP was in those
zones to begin with. Kedge, for example, had a higher-than-average ZEM even
before the patch. So saying "Kedge got bumped up X%" doesn't mean much,
because you can't just compare those percentages and figure out which zone
gives better XP per mob.
