Skull Shaped Barbute, 13AC 35HP 10svMagic

Replace both rings with Velium Fire Emerald rings (6AC 65HP ea.)

Rest of the stuff, go kill Icewell Sentrys/Guardians in Icewell Keep and get
the Royal Velium Frosted stuff, EXTREME AC compared to most of the stuff
you've got (eg crafted)  or else go on a planes raid or two, or
three...dozen and get Indicolite or the stuff in PoG.  Or you might try to
get in on some Kael raids and get your Thurgadin armor quests.

Also, An orc fang necklace from the Ry'gorr fort has 1 more AC than the
chipped velium amulet but 1 less STR and no HP, although it does have 3STA
and 3AGI.

The frost covered tome is good for a range slot item, but you should have
some sort of bow for pulling, and you might consider getting an idol of the
thorned for when you don't need the 15svFire.

Lose the Wurmy and CoT and get 2 Lamentations (this is assuming money is no
object) or 1 Lammy and a Crystalline Short Sword (the 12/24 one out of
Sebilis with 4STR 6CHA 6INT and 4AGI)  or if you prefer proccing, a Kunzar
Ku'juch and Journeyman's Walking Stick, Kunzar procs a snare/dot at 40,
Jstick procs Tashani at 35.  or if you prefer, get one of the Dragon
Necropolis Uber Velium Whomping Sticks of Doom ( just about any of the
exquisite/crafted/etched/aged/engraved/heavy/forged/light/polished/massive/t
empered/weighted velium weapons that drop in DN )

Rubicite BPs are nice, but at your level, you NEED more AC on the BP,
Crafted even has 22, but you might look in to a Treeweave(25AC 10STR) or
Barbed Ringmail(30AC 9STR 50HP) or even a Fungi Tunic(21AC 2STR 2INT
negative 10DEX and negative 10AGI and ~15HP/tick regen)
