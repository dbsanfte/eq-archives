I don't know this, but you might become visible once you give the first set
of gnoll fangs.  If I were to try this, and there's a possibility of
becoming visible, I'd try giving her 80 fangs at once (full stacks of 20 in
each open 'give' window).

It still may not be enough, since Barbarians are a stubborn lot.  One set of
three fangs will NOT be enough to change their minds about you, and you may
not get a second chance to give more fangs before having to do a corpse run.

Of course, if you would choose to play nice, good-aligned characters, you
wouldn't have this problem now, would you?
