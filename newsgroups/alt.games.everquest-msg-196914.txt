I didn't max out mine, except for the last in that line of the 
special skills (ie, flying kick but not kick or round kick and 
dragon punch but not tiger claw or eagle strike.)

But, some of our disciplines use some of those skills. 
Thunderstike works with a kick so get one of em maxed. 2 others 
uses Eagle Strike and Dragon Punch. I'm only 58 so I don't know 
much about those 2 but maxing both out, just in case they come in 
handy.

Also, get a dex buff for working up your skills. You'll probably 
even pay for a good shammy buff at higher levels, it will really 
cut down on your skillup time.

Good luck
