That would be wonderful if it was, I guess, but I sort of doubt it.
Wasn't the original intent of the Euro Servers to give all the Euro
players a chance to move to someplace with less connectivity and lag
issues?

Then again, I guess it would be equally fair to say that our Euro
friends should have both a movelog server and a start-from-scratch
server.  I just wonder how many 'Merkins (who are constantly screaming
for a "fresh" blue server thinking it will somehow be different) will
start playing there. Then, of course, will come the inevitable posts
that the lag on the new server is crap from Cleveland, Ohio, and VI's
tech peopel are incompetent fuckwads.

I'll confess, I've been tempted to start up on a fresh server just to
watch the economy grow, but nothing much would be different three months
down the road when the first uberguild of powergamers began to gell.
