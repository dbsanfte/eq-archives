Just to say first you dont kill the VSR you hand a globe to him and he
despawns with a spirit in his place who you give a ressurection spell to
which spawns VS who you kill, you probably know this already but just in
case.
anyway I have found on a number of occasions that VSR is up after a patch or
server reset so it may be worth alerting your guild next time it happens, be
quick though because he despawns a few hours after I think.
