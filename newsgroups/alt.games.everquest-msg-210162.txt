Of course.   But I can count the number of 1 group vindi kills on 1 hand,
the number of raid force vindi kills, on the other hand... :)

Anyway I was refering to normal sized raids, AE damage and the like..
outside of fights like xegony, offossa, AM.. why would you not heal your
group versus pyro, or fennin minis?  Contrary to the original post, changing
targets in fights like that would not have a significant effect on the raid.

Like I said, of course this requires a cleric with more than 2 brain cells
to re-target the MA in a timely manner
