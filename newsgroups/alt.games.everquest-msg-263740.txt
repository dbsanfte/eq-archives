My WoW ST experience was kinda thje opposite.  Horrible server-side
problems throughout.  After a serious bout of downtime, the group of
us rolled new chars on a different serverand had most of the problems
disappear.  WoW seemed to be affected quite severely by server-side
issues.  

We'll have to see if EQ2 is a client or server side problem.  Maybe
they're trying to update too much info in the large zones?

Again, not sure what might be causing this, but I will give them some
slack on it.  I've played a lot of games that I couldn't run at the
max setting sat the time, and most of them didn't have the longevity
that a MMORPG is likely to have.  Buildinf for the future is fine,
otherwise you'll end up looking horribly dated at your *cough* 5th
anniversary and end up rushing a new graphics engine out the door
*cough*
