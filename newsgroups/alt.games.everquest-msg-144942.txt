Admittedly my ranger experience lies principly with damage dealing
non "tank wannabees", and almost entirely in the sub 57 range, but
what I've seen are rangers that jolt, and rangers that die waaay too
often.  I prefer the Jolting ones.  There is a third sort of ranger, the
ones that got tons of AC and HP gear and try to act as main tanks;
I hear that at the high end rangers get to where they can do an adequate
job with this style... I just have to ask myself if they wanted a warrior
why they didn't make one in the first place.  And a fourth sort, who
deliberately use slow no proc weapons in order to keep aggro off them
selves... you know, like they had to for the first 51 levels of their
lives.
These ones don't need Jolt either, but they do damage like a warrior,
so again, why didn't they just make one in the first place?
