Wardens and Enchanters get speed spells that are more comparable to
SOW, actually.  They start out at about 20% (more like begining
Selo's), but ramp up to about the same level as high level SOW at the
higher spec levels.  Bards start out at about 44%, and ramp up to
around 100%, so they are more like EQ bard-type speed.

The other realms are similar, with a couple classes getting a speed
spell, and the singing classes getting even faster speed.
