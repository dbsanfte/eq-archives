They have discontinued support for the old UI.  The "new" UI is now
simply the UI.  First, they made the new UI available to all.  Then
they made it the default choice.  Then they dropped the old UI.
IIRC, they started the process a few months after SoL came out and
finished it well before PoP was released.
