Ok I am game and am trying Legends - I am trying it for a month or two - it
amounts to after all about half of what i spend on dvds and movies. I was
just puzzled by tryying to get into it - for all I know it will be uber
despite the jokes about insert master card for fungi tunic etc etc. Maybe
the one reason I posted was because I went to main site and it seems like
nothing was wrong and I have been trying to connect for a couple hours off
and on. Dialup simply would not access the servers this afternoon and bored,
I posted. If they can make dynamic content I am happy because I am starting
to get very bored with the camps. I can kill x number of mobs and ding but
that may take a weekend assuming good luck of groups and not getting killed
a bunch. And the overwhelming majority of my friends who started EQ have
basically retired their chars (quit). It would be nice to have the
information posted on the main site - real time server status and perhaps a
chat area. I was looking at the main EQ site btw.

In reality for all of jokes about EQ (evercrash, neverlog etc etc), it is
quite ground breaking - the quests and the interaction of the REAL people.
Quake engine is nice but you know that the sargeant is going to be around
the next corner and you need the shotgun to kill him.  Eq is totally
different - when you log on you dont know what kind of group or mob (up to a
point). If Verant can pull off another step in the direction of
unpredicatability, mini epics, side adventures, story development and game
play I will be there. Good luck all - legends or not.
