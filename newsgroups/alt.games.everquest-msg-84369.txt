I don't really see much point in continuing this, we will, in the end,
continue to feel the way we did about it before this round of the discussion
on inspecting.  I disagree with you for two reasons, one, the one I gave
already, the other, I find it impolite.  Why do I feel that way?  I don't
know, why do people think it's impolite to reach at the table?  Why is it
impolite to not say "please" and "thank you"?  Just because I can reach
across the table doesn't mean it is polite to do so.  Just because I can
inspect doesn't mean it's polite to do so.  Does it hurt me in any way when
someone inspects me?  No, of course not, I just consider it rude.  You
don't.  I understand that, I accept that.  I see no point in arguing the
point, it has been argued to death in this newsgroup many times.  You don't
consider inxpections to be invasive, I do.  You are no more likely to change
my mind on the subject that I am to change yours.  I never have, and never
will lose any sleep over it, or fly into a rage over it, or even say
anything to anyone about it.
