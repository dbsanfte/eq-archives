How many times have you been harassed because you like red?  Do you find
people calling other people vanilla ice cream eaters to insult them?  If
someone in your guildchat mentions something about the great chocolate ice
cream they had for dessert, do you have to keep silent about the vanilla ice
cream you had?

There are many people who treat gay, lesbian, and bisexuals similarly to the
way many people treated black people before the civil rights movement.  It
makes a lot of sense for GLB game players to want to form guilds where they
will not be treated that way.
