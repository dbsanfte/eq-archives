    All the melees look like Cher with all the mismatched pieces, and they
make fun of someone with a matched suit of armour? People in glass houses!

    For fun, challenge any warrior there to whip out Earthshaker and do the
auto-riposte /disc followed by an AoE Taunt when that happens. We figured
that with enough people in the room dying, the warrior could likely kill the
named mob by himself that way.

    Oh, and that's anyone who dies IN ALL OF CoD when he's being fought.
Good to know if you see a group doing XP at the zone-in.

    Don't things like this make you wonder about your guildmates? We repeat
everything in raid several times just to make sure folks get the message.

    LOL, that's one method to figure it out. ;-) I've heard of guilds doing
/randoms, and my personal favourite, guilds forcing members to pay DKPs to
get the key.

    The red mob is the trigger - kill it, and the event starts. It is
trivial to any raid that has a hope of killing Bertox. Before that was put
in, the trigger was clicking on the chair.

    Woo-hoo! I'm up to 219 base Tailoring now, and loving every minute of
it. I've started selling the cloaks for that Wood Elf illusion thing that
I'll never get personally. What I'm really looking forward to is the
elemental plane silks. 120 HP robe, yummy!

    The mobs in there are pretty clever, and will frequently re-damage
shield themselves. That wastes time they could be hitting folks, though, so
it's still smart to MoK them. Did anyone come late and have to get dragged
through the door after dying there?

    To pronounce his first name, make the sound a caster makes when the
caster is hit by him. "Ta'Grusch!"

    They worry any sane cleric. 3500 is ungodly - we double-checked with the
monks that tested him when we first found him. "Did you say 3500?!?"

    MT wouldn't last while you're waiting for the first CH to land.
Sometimes I wonder if we'd be better off having everyone go full-out nuke.

    Very, VERY few HPs. Last time we went we had a manaburner hit him with
that, and it went amazingly fast.

    No, you won't!

    The room is really nice. Considering the crap you have to go through to
get there (ask your guild about the key quest sometime), it should have a
hot tub and a buffet, too.

    The mobs are non-KOS, and when they get to the Prophet they glue onto
him and give him a small rune. They aren't worth worrying about.

    Whoops! Should have consulted the l33t b3t@ 1nf0z.

    Ok, this is what happens if someone actually responds to her text.
Everyone in the raid near her gets ported to a new place, a bunch of rooms
and stairways with random mobs in them. It's kinda like a maze. Fight your
way through, kill boss mob at end, hail the person (Tylis Newleaf, wasn't
it?) for a flag. Get ported back to room with cage when you say the correct
phrase. Now, remember the sick person in PoTranq who you first offered to
help to get Torment access? That person in the cage was the sick person. We
THINK that your Saryn flag won't count (you won't be able to get text from
another NPC) until you complete this. You do get a character flag for it. We
just don't have anyone unflagged on this to test our theory. There's one
other guild on the server with a Saryn kill, and they didn't do the Tylis
event, so they can test it for us. =)

    Or, you could just move around the room, following the bird and not
getting hit by the AoE! Saryn doesn't hit hard, and the bird moves pretty
slowly. The biggest problem in that fight is the adds - they must die fast.

    And your raid leaders agree with me!

    Res and rebuff on the top of the stairs. It's a safe spot, as you
noticed when you were standing there admiring the scenery. Just have to move
quickly before corpses poof to the GY.

    That's the good thing about PoP fights - they go quickly.

    Clerics are herd animals! ;-)

    The raven's AoE silence only goes off at one of the "points" of the
triangular path it flies. Guess the radius (or cheat and look it up on
Lucy), do a little geometry, and presto, you know the "safe spot" to stand.

    We usually have a group dedicated to keeping the MA up, and other groups
are made as OT groups. Clerics in OT groups have primary responsibility to
their OT group.

    Hmm. I never had issues with mana, nor did my fellow clerics. Might have
been a responsibility issue. When clerics don't have clear instructions on
who to keep alive, they tend to try to play hero and keep everyone in the
zone alive, spamming heals like crazy. Later encounters will wean them off
that, though, as adds pop at odd times and tend to kill whoever hits the
hate list first - like people throwing around tons of heals. ;-)

    Boo, that's the sort of lie a High Elf tells! Take that back!

    Congrats on Saryn. Now go kill more gods!
