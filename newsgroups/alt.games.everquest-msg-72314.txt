I am a Level 21 Erudite Wizard of Quellious on Fennin Ro. I want to make 29
as quickly as possible, definately within the next two weeks. Anyone have
any tips? I currently have 186 INT (nice mana pool), decent equipment but
nothing special (i.e I have a stein of moggok but no Jboots for me yet :)).
What can I do to make great xp at this level? Soloing in Ill Omen is nice
but dangerous as many of the mobs have high magic resistance, so I land only
partial and sometimes full resists.

Thanks for any input
