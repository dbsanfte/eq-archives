I've been annoyed in the past by that item or spell or whatever
it is that gives everyone in MGB area a stack of food (another
does water) but not enough to worry about it.

If the altered function of Mod2 I saw elsewhere on this newsgroup
isn't a hoax, though, we are about to see a bunch of pure melee
getting mod rods from mages, MGB style.  While this isn't the
worst thing in the world that could happen to them, I'm wondering
if there is a setting somewhere that would allow them to refuse
to accept them, automatically.

Thinking further about this, though, the simplest way is for them
to already have a mod rod on their person, since the things won't
stack.  So at start of raid they get one, drop it in a bag in
case its needed some time later, and don't have to worry about
subsequent casts mucking up their cursor.

Hmm, looked again, and the new mod rod is still no drop.  So if
you are a warrior, rogue, monk, or bard, mod rods are only useful
as a way to do damage to yourself, or as a really crappy back up
weapon.  A way to refuse them would be handy.
