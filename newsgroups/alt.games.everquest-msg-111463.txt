True, but the type of modem that is being referenced here uses software to 
emulate most of the actual modem functionality.  In other words, it does 
require CPU cycles just to do the modulation/demodulation.  A heavily 
loaded system, or an application such as EQ that sucks up all available 
resources, can cause significant problems.
