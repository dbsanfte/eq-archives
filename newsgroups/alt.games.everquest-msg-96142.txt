This is fun! It's obvious he's really thought this out.

ALL RIGHTY THEN!

I'm a cleric, in a dungeon. Clerics often don't have gate up, it's not
their job to gate out, they're supposed to DA and /camp out.

So, I tank a bit to try to get my last defense point, putting me under
80% health. I have no SoW (a dungeon, remember? I dunno if your soloing
ass knows what a dungeon is, hughes, but suffice to say it's an indoor
zone where SoW doesn't work). I have 30% mana (enough for 2 CHs). I go
LD while the puller gets a single mob. Because I LD while the puller
pulls, I'm still sitting, and the mob beelines for me. Now then, I'm
supposed to die? Your rules say yes, no way I'd die if I weren't LD.

NOW! I'm still a cleric, a vengeful one, I decide to train some moron
who I don't like. I make sure I load DA and Gate, med to full, and make
sure I'm fully healed. I drink a SoW potion, pull the entire zone, then
DA and pull the plug 2 feet from the medding AFK bastard wot I hate. I
timeout immediately, meeting all your criteria. Big win for all, right?

The big difference between you (and other normal people) and hughes is
that you're obviously able to deal with LD deaths. He's very much not.

Oooh, multiple choice time! Ooooh, oooh, I know! Is it E?
