Whenever I go out of town on business, the first place I scope out is a
bookstore ... Borders, B&N, Books-A-Million ... matters not to me.  I can
spend ages in a bookstore ......

At our Borders, the cafe and the books are so close in proximity that it
would be almost impossible for them to keep the two separated.  At the local
Books-A-Million there's a low partition between the cafe and the stacks, but
they still don't mind you taking books into the cafe.

We must look honest around here .... ;-)
