This is crap.  I have 256MB as they say, GeF 2 Ultra 64MB, and a 1.6GB
PIV.  I am getting crashed out like crazy.  Only half the models up at
MED rez.  Patched up.  Still no good.  Oh well.  Turned all the stuff
off and its still choppy.  DX 8.0 and this new stuff is NOT worth such
a sacrifice in performance.  The models I saw looked great, but the
lag was so bad, I'd be looking just as good lying on the ground dead
after some MoB ruled me.  And if you turn them on, its hit or miss
whether the program gets to the char selection screen.

Sorry I am not impressed by the direction.  EQ is all about atmosphere
and fun.  Not eye candy to the max.

Wonder how many Poly's it takes to make the fem elves so well endowed.
Guess that was priority...
