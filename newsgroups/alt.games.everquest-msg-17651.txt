I know, and I thought about picking this face. But then I ran into a
female dwarf warrior in full bronze, and the only way I could tell she
was a dwarf was because she had shoes on, and no ears sticking out of
her helm. They just don't look like *dwarves* to me. I'm too used to
thinking of dwarves as unisex looking, and the only way to tell the
sexes apart is be extremely delicate in the questioning.
