Aye, what you say is true.  My list was started when Focus effects were 
first added to the game.  At the time, Zephyr of Brell was an effect, and 
not a focus effect, that provided the 20% EE IV and a couple mana regen 
per tick.  Then, later, since they had focus effects, they split it into 
an effect: FT III (which was an upgrade as I recall) and focus effect: 
Zephyr of Brell (the 20% EE IV).  

And round about that time PoP came out and suddenly there were all kinds 
of level IV focus effects, and I was just starting to notice tons of other 
named focus effects on vex thal gear, and it looked like just too much of 
a nightmare.  Sanguine Preservation? Focus of Solusek? Ack!  To make 
matters worse, there were lots of them that were part one thing and part 
another (Should focus of Solusek go under mana preservation or affliction 
efficency or what? aigh!)

Anyway, if I do get around to upgrading the page, I wanna get all those 
other tricky bits sorted out.  But that might keep me busy until June 2006 
or so. :)  But almost all the droppable, reasonable for twinking, items 
are on there.  I think. :)

Of -course- I wear that lovely shawl.  I wouldn't leave home without it.
