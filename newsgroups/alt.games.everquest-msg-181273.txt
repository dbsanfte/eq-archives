I can't definitely understand how that can happen. :)

The first 10 levels are a piece of cake now, so if you are already 
familiar with the game, it makes it much quicker and easier to get to the 
meat and potatoes. That was a huge improvement.

It's just the original EQ plus the planes. I would suggest going for the 
gold tin package that contains everything for $50US or so. That will 
still leave you with your original stuff you used a couple years ago for 
a second account if you need a transfer mule or just more character 
slots. I always found that even eight slots just wasn't enough for me.  
:)

As far as I'm concerned, the easier 1-10, the PoP transport system and 
the Bazaar are reason enough to come back.
