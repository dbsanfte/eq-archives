That would be because cost has nothing to do with price beyond
setting a minimum for sustainable operations.  Prices are a
function of the market, they are determined by the producer's
estimation of how much customers are willing and able to pay.
The price that a market will sustain is determined by perceived
need (the root of that evil known as marketing) vs. cost and
availability of known alternatives (don't pay for Brand X when
we'll sell you Brand Y for less!).  This is why competition is
(usually) good and monopolies are (almost without exception)
evil.  IOW, the rate increase for EQ was, apparently, a case of
SOE noticing DAoC's success at entering the market with the
higher subscription rate in place.  So blame DAoC for failing
to directly compete with EQ and thereby demonstrating to SOE
that there was room to raise rates instead of the pressuring
them to lower prices as is usual with competition.
