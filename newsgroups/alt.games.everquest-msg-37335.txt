Keep your Allure of death on as long as possible. When you fight start with
darkness, fear, dot then life tap, keep taping till full or near full
health. What I like to do is save the last tap for when the mob is almost
dead  then tap it, you'll get all but a small bit of exp (the rest goes to
the pet) and you'll be at full health and set to med again. At that low of a
level you are better off getting + mana items, the moonstone rings are
almost give away items now, but good for lower level casters +3 str +30 mana
each. See if you can lay hands on a dustscryer's crystal ball +2 int +30
mana range slot item  very nice for casters.
