Actually, for most it's not lack of computer hardware.  It's the
shit-for-brains release management they have in place.

You don't release an expansion and within a single week end up having
6 emergency patches.

The game as it is is so buggy it's playability is non-existent.  We're
talking about memory leaks so significant, it's chewing up 1.9+GB of
page file.

We're talking about zones so buggy that you can LD and get "trapped"
in that zone.

Login process is fooked--you login and get disconnected instantly.

The little warning box that warns you that you don't have SoL
installed and are playing an SoL enabled account that they put in with
the last patch is broken (as in, I HAVE SoL installed you retarded
little piece of shit program!).

I can go on and on and on, but you get the general idea.  These aren't
"minor" bugs (the last actually causes a crash on some systems btw),
these are bugs that directly impact playability (or lack thereof).

When I connect to the Chat server to check on the Tech Support rooms,
what do I see?  GMs indicating that the high priority bugs are bugs
like "you lose your SoL character model face when you zone, it returns
to the default face."

Wow!  That's a priority 1 bug alright!
Especially since most people can't even play with the fucking Luclin
models turned on due to lag and piss poor performance.
