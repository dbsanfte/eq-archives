I suppose the Dalai Lama -is- technically western now, eh? :)  Ok, how 
about Lao Tzu, or Buddha, or Confucius, the long tradition of asian monks 
that don't go around acting like Samurai?

Even Shaolin isn't -about- asskicking, even if they may be good at it.  
Check question #19 in this here handy-dandy FAQ:

}Absolutely - I agree completely here.  Call a martial artist a martial

Mebbe if we start a petition about it somewhere?  What the heck, it worked 
for druids. :)
