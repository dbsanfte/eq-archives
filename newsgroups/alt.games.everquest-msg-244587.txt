I'm in the best guild in EverQuest[1].Currently, raid leaders will
usually say, "We've found our target. Don't start any new LDoNs" about
30-45 minutes before a rally is called. We have that luxury because
90% of our current raid targets are either mostly uncontested, on
rotation, or part of a backflagging agreement. The only target we
really race for anymore is Emperor in Ssra, which we haven't lost
since we made him a priority.

But, every member who signed up for this guild had it made clear to
them: the guild exists to raid. If you're on when a raid is called,
you're expected to be there. Backflagging is particularly tricky.
Guilds that have, historically, gone at it hammer and tongs, are
cooperating on making this task less tedious. But, competitor guilds
are not about to hold up their raids so that someone in our guild can
finish their LDoN. And, when we start competing on elemental gods,
we're not going to have the luxury of calling a target 45 minutes in
advance. It won't be there in 45 minutes.

I hate leaving a LDoN group in the lurch, especially as a cleric. But
the fact is that our guild will eventually cease to exist in any
recognizable form if we're not willing to race for targets.

You're obviously in a very different sort of guild than I am.

[1] By definition. If I didn't believe this, I wouldn't be in the
guild.
