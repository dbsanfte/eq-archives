}I think I know what items I'll never be making.
}How much does that sell for, or is it no drop?

Yep, took me two tries, because we failed on the pottery combine (trivial 
under 150 somewhere, supposedly.  Ouch.)  The final trophy is no drop, but 
the artisan's seal (basicaly, all the expensive parts put together for the 
final combine) is droppable.  I have heard estimates that it would sell 
for 5-6Kpp.
