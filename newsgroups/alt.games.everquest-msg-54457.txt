    All the references can be found on the Dev board or the Testing boards.
The bard Lambent quest NPC hinted at a quest weapon in his text - that text
is gone. The Forest Barley for the second Holy Symbol of Brell Serilis had
gone missing off the Kith vendor where it was found - it's back now. Froglok
Eyes for making practice runes weren't dropping very often at all - the drop
rate was upped. Timbur the Tiny had to be killed for a quest in game, but
even with constant clearing of his PH he was a once-per-month spawn. That's
been upped to once per week.

    And the last part is the usual Halloween tomfoolery. 8)
