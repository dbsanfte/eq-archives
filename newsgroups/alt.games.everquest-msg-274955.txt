At the lower levels, you are gonna get somewhere fast.  Unless you're the
grinder type who wants to be the highest level with all the AA's and the
best gear money can buy, you will probably feel you are getting somewhere
when you go buy those lvl 4 spells or train in your new melee skill.  The
lower levels go by fast, so, to me anyway, it actually feels like I'm
getting somewhere faster when I'm playing a low level character than when I
play a higher level one.  If you are brand new and you've only got an hour
to play, go kill some decaying skeletons or a few orcs and by the end of the
hour you'll have gained at least 1 level, maybe 2, so you'll feel like
you're getting somewhere.  Also, lower level groups don't seem to last as
long, so if you want to group but don't have alot of time it shouldn't be a
problem till you're in your mid and high levels.
