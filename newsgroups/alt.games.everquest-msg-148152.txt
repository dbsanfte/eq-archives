It's just a camp with two mobs, both of which have pets.  Any
tactic good for breaking a camp that's spawned works.  And,
if you can't break that, you'll have zero success getting
the two hearts you need for the quest in dungeons anyway.

Harmony should work, mez will work, pulling and rooting the
two pets while you kill the skeletons works, bringing a good
enough group to kill four level 25 mobs at once works, etc.
At level 30, you'll need a reasonably good group.  At the
upper 30s, you'll just need you, a tank, and a healer.  (Some
of the mobs you'll have to fight are still good XP at 38, BTW.)
