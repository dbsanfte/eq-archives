Same here, rezzed and been rezzed out of group, but, was about two weeks 
ago, and there is indeed no comfirmation box as of the last time I was 
rezzed.

One nifty thing they added was a spell to summon an item that allows any 
player to rez you (the priest) in (might work on anyone, have never tried 
it).  Summon one for each group member, and even if the priest dies, so 
long as one person lives, all can be rezzed back in.
