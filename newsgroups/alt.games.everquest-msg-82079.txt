It's a different approach to VI, one which makes quite a bit of sense.
Guilds are going to farm Ragefire as long as his drop table isn't
nerfed.  If they do, their twink clerics are going to end up with the
heart container for whenever they will need it.  You solve that, maybe,
by asking VI to make the heart container NO RENT.   Now it can't
go to a twink.

VI is (most likely) going to ignore the issue of having level 24 clerics
with an epic drop from Ragefire (something that will happen if the
container isn't NO RENT.)   VI is a lot more likely to respond
favorably if it's pointed out that the script of the quest isn't being
followed.   That's a design issue;  a twink with an epic drop isn't.
