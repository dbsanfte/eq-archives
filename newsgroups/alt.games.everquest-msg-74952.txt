Welcome to the club :)

This is a common problem that users of Win2K and XP are having.  I have the
exact same issue that you are having.

It's not an EQ problem however, as I have a couple other applications that
produce stuttering sounds and feedback.

Guess we'll just have to wait for creative to come out with a patch, or for
Verant to find a work around.

Turn your music off, as it will help considerably.
