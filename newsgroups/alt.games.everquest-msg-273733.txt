A lot of people who aren't lfg are willing to group. 

I agree a drive by click-invite is a big "don't", but I get tremendously 
good results with a simple polite tell asking if they'd be interested in 
joining forces, or better still an in person 'say' during their 
downtime. (I always do it from the same zone, usually within sight of 
them) Sometimes they decline but never has anyone given me a line about 
how if they were lfg they'd have their tag up.

I do love ignoring those guys that 'hover' near a group though, ooc'ing 
"classX LFG" over and over. If they actually ask us (rare occurance)... 
they are usually invited.

My absolute favorite though is this coming through on ooc over a 10 
minute span:

...
Monk 50 LFG
Warrior 49 LFG
Cleric 44 LFG
Warrior 49 LFG
Cleric 44 LFG
Monk 50 LFG
Warrior 49 LFG
Cleric 49 LFG
Monk 50 LFG
...

Come on people... its not rocket science.
