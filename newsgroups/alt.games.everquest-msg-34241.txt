Subject: (OT) Problems playing since i ditched BT

This is really only for the UK players. I used to connect with BT but i
recently switched to NTL and though AOL assures me my connection speed is
adequate i can no longer play EQ. The ping is always 1000+ sometimes up to 2000
and the other end of that bar is constantly yellow/red even if im just standing
still, if i engage in combat its a joke and the packet loss will dump me after
5 or 10 minutes. Has anybody else who connects with NTL experienced this sort
of thing? and are there any ways in which i can improve my connection speeds? I
blame aol mostly because they have over 15 BT connect numbers and 1 fucking
'other' companies line which must therefore be hugely congested. Also does
anybody know where i could get a reliable test of my connection speed? because
i know the rate aol presents is a load of horseshit. I either need to change my
mickey mouse 'Yum Yum i can swallow all your RAM' ISP or phone company. If
anybody could shed a little light on this subject, especially other ntl users
who maybe use a different isp, id be most grateful and sorry about the rant.
Another thing, does anybody know exactly why aol installs such an enormous
amount of its software onto the users hard drive?
