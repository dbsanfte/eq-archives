They released a limited number of cds to the retail market.Ebgames has them on
the website ,but Gamestop is already out on their website.Most stores i know of
in my area either have 1 or no copies left.Whatever is out there now is all
there will be they aren't reprinting it as a seperate product ,may show up
later on if they have another complete set of all expansions,but no word on
that yet..So if you want it get out and get it now.As was stated in an earlier
post,it is only in jewel box form ,it doesn't come in a box.
