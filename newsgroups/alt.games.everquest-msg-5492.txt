Just a couple of things I noticed, categorically:

The first of which was that you never offered your thoughts to Matt Frisch's
behavior, and whether or not it equated to the very thing for which Zeppo
was dismissed from his ISP.

The second of which is justifying "tattling" (I'll call it what it is), then
claiming some kind of victory for it.  It's akin to "I told Johnny's mom and
she sent him to bed without dinner.  Neener, neener, neener", which is
childish, any way you slice it.
