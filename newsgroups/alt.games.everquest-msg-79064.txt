It doesn't offend me in the least. I'm just wondering at what point your
enchanter will be able to 'take care of him/herself'. Hopefully for you that
point will come before you start hunting in a zone without guards. I can't
think what strategy you are going to use then that won't work now.

Personally I work out a character's escape plan when I leave the newbie
field.
