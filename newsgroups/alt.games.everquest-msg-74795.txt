The data file IS appended to.

The problem is that with new versions of the program, I add new data to the
file, so the format changes.  As of now, there have been 3 releases with the
data file feature, so I'd have to support 3 different file formats in the
current version, with an additional format every time I released a new one.

Sorry, ain't gonna happen.  This is why I explicitly said not to delete the
logs when I first added the feature.  Zip'em up.  Burn'em to CD.  Whatever. 
Just don't delete them.
