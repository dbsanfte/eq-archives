You might be forced to interact with other people with those wyverns. 

It's literally impossible for that to happen in an instanced
"dungeon". Instancing is the worst thing to ever happen to mmorpgs.

EQ is dead without interaction. As a single player or single group
game its grossly outclassed by the non-mmorpg competition. To succeed
they have to play to their strength which is the interaction.

Failure to understand this is why EQ has been spinning its wheels for
so long now, and why games and expansions that focus in the wrong
direction keep flopping.

...

Hey you guys keep pining and hoping for your instanced solo worlds. If
you guys have your way soon you'll be able to play EQ without ever
having to deal with other people at all, except as a glorified chat
interface. Everyone playing in their own little world instead of one
big one.

Yeah, sounds massively multiplayer to me.

How long until you're asking for an instanced room with a button to
spawn any mob you want with any loot you want? That's not very far
from what you people are asking for.
