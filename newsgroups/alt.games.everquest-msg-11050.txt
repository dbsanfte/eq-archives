Sounds about right. Wondering around as a clueless newbie is one of
the funnest parts of the game. Some non-spoiler tips:

1. Go into graphic options and turn up your gamma setting. Makes it
easier to see at night.

2. You generally don't buy weapons and armor from merchants. You get
far better value from looting (free) and from other players.

3. Yea rusty sucks. hint: ask a blacksmith if s/he can help you out
;-)
