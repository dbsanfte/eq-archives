  Except he's already said that one of the GMs said that their logs were
showing that Tunare was killed by a player character.  Maybe the GM was just
lying to try to get them out of their hair, that doesn't seem to mesh with a
GM /killing it, or a bug, or an intentional feature that is supposed to make
Tunare despawn for no apparent reason.  Or maybe Martin has his story wrong
or is lying.

  Another thing... you made a big point about how the GM would have to
access logs to check on guildchat and that it simply wouldn't be worth the
trouble and there would be no point in it.  However, it's possible the
guildmate guy sniped at the GM in /tells or /say and nobody else in the
guild say it... the only thing we can be sure about is that the guildmate
wasn't entirely pleased with the GM's lack of assistance, which means
there's a strong possibility he said something directly to the GM.  Also,
it's possible the GM researched the logs for a reason other than looking for
a snipe (perhaps something that pertained to the issue the person was
/petitioning about) and just happened to see the snipe.

  Either way, if Martin's story is for the most part accurate, something
fishy DID go down and I would think it'd be worthy of a GM showing up on the
spot to assist and investigate.  Spending 11 hours to clear a plane just to
have the boss mob disappear is a fairly major issue, no matter what might
have caused it.
