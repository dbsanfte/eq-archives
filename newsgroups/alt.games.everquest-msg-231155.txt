Have you tried camping the bazaar instead of the actual drop?  There are 
several items out there with heat vision or ultravision, and you can 
probably earn the cash to buy one faster than you can get one to drop 
killing in a greenie zone like sol A.

Another approach is midway between potions and something permanent; mage 
summons.  Heatstone, Coldstone are both items which fit in either neck 
slot or ammo slot; as a paladin you are probably pulling with a spell 
and so don't have any real use for ammo slot.  Heatstone gives 
infravision and is a level 16 summon for a mage, coldstone gives the 
marginally superior ultravision and is a level 29 mage spell.  Both have 
a little AC on them as well, the AC works only in the neck slot, and you 
should certainly have a better neck than what little these accord you.

A favorite of mine is the Orb of Exploration, which fits in several 
slots you won't want to give up, plus your ammo slot again; to me the 
key slot since nothing in that slot will give you stats.  This item 
gives Plainsight, which is Ultravision plus see invis, very handy for 
following people around invis, or for hunting in spots like Velks where 
some mobs are invis till they backstab you, or for (my biggest use) 
giving gear to my annoyingly invisible air pet.  Trouble is, this is a 
44 summon, but you can only get the spell with LDoN points, and most 
mages don't bother with it, so its unlikely you can get one.

Why are these in between potion and permanent?  Well, they are No Rent, 
which means they vanish if you go offline for more than a few minutes. 
But while you are logged on, they Never wear off, unlike potions or 
buffs.  Invest a few minutes before doing your LDoN run getting one, and 
its going to be there for you the whole run.  A level 16+ mage isn't all 
that hard to find, and if not free, at least a very small bribe should work.

Something of your own will be better, of course, in the long run, but 
given that you don't need the solution very often, its probably not 
impractical to use the mage based one.
