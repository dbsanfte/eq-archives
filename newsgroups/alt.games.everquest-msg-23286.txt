It can backfire... My shadow knight recently dinged 12 and learned how
to meditate. She doesn't sit still often, but last night I had her on
her butt for a minute or two and wondered why she didn't get meditate
raises. Lo and behold, I'd forgotten to replace her sit hotkey with a
spellbook hotkey :)

Gate is for indoors later, mostly. Get in trouble you can't run from,
cast gate and hope your channeling skill holds.
And when you get bigger, you'll encounter mobs that will catch up with
you if you don't have sow. I died to a kunark rhino once because my
sow dropped while he was chasing me and I was oom.

The bobbing annoys me a little, so I usually only use it when I am
running cross country in bumpy and dangerous terrain.
