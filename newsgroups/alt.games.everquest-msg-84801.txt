Subject: what do you think of runnyeye?

I'm a level 26 monk.
For a change of pace I want to hunt in a dungeon. Because it ties to the
treant fist quest, I was thinking of soloing in runnyeye.  I wouldn't mind
grouping, but I'm not expecting to see many people in there.

Do you think I can successfully solo in runnyeye?  Will I get reasonable
xp and pp?  Is it too risky?  Is there enough spacing to I can hunt (feign
death split) and kill things when they run?  Any experiences?

Please give me your advice.
