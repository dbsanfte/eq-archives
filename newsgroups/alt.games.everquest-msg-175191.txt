Saying "he wouldnt be welcome" is probably overdoing it a bit, tho certainly
someone who can do their buffs quietly without being asked would be worth a
bit of faction. I play an enchanter, and I always try to refresh hastes
early, when I have good mana. (Casting SOV, not using epic). Cast buffs on
yourself to time it if you dont want to watch the clock.
