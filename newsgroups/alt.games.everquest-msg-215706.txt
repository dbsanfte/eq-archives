Actually I keep Netscape 4.7 running in the background, because I can window out
to it and then come back to the game without having to quit out, but I can't
window out to desktop and then load netscape; something in the load process is
too big to handle.

But my point is, I was able to run that in the background just fine for the past
year or so (well, ok, since about a month after they made the change that added
the native to EQ capability to put EQ in a window... no idea how long thats been
really; took me about a month to figure out how to get Netscape to run under
those circumstances).  So the patch changed something; whether it was as simple
as the capability to run anything at all in background I don't know.  If so,
perhaps its a "feature" rather than a bug?

I can go try "raid mode" settings, although I'm about halfway there already, I
have about 4 luclin models active, one up from the bottom resolution, fancy
spell displays off and so forth... hard to see really why most of those would
have any effect on zoning, though, I'm not LDing when I try to look around the
bazaar or am near the bank in POK (where there are often tons of spell casting
effects going on), its when I'm as far away from any visual effects as I can
get, looking at a zone line!

Too, when I zone, its reasonably fast.  In fact, several times I've crashed out
and gotten back in the game before one of my groupmates finished zoning.
