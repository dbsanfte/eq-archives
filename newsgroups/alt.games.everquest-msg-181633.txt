    The quick list:

<anything> darkness = upgrade to previous level <anything> darkness spell
arystole = upgrade to heart flutter
<anything> blood = upgrade to previous <anything> blood
Every time you get a life tap/life drain spell its an upgrade to the
previous
Abduction of strength = upgrade to the level 9 str tap
Every pet spell is a replacement of the last

Some "upgrades" are really a new spell that stacks with the others of that
line, ala spear of <anything> - they're all .5second cast 30 second recast
nukes, casting more together is merrier. The taunt spells work the same way
although once you're stacking 400 and 450 hate dont reckon many people will
bother with the 200 one.

Thats as much as i recall off the top of my head...

Cheers,
James
