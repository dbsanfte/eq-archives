I wonder if http://home.earthlink.net/~matuse/_wsn/page2.html has been
brought to their attention. :)  If so I wonder if they're only looking at
reproducing the bug, maybe adding a patch or command that will only be
available to GMs.  Maybe some "special" character animation that will be
anatomically correct that only works from within Verant's network that the
GMs use. :) :)  I bet those GMs would love their anonymous and invisible
commands. :)

/who GM
There are 500 GMs in Kelethin.

P.S.  Does this patch message being posted mean the servers are back up?
