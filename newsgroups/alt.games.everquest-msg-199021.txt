His comment was not meant as insulting.  Did you take it as insulting?  Yes.
Would everyone take it as insulting?  Obviously that's a big no.  The fact
that you call 4 other people illogical and insult them because they don't
believe it was insulting is the ironic part.  The fact that you were a big
dick about it is what caused others to be insulting after the original
statement.
