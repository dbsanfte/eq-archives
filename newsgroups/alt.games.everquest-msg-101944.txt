Next time you kill Lodi, I suggest you have someone loot the shield
piece and give it to its proper owner later. There's no reason stuff
like that should happen with droppable items or quest items where the
end result is droppable.

Back to the earlier topic: I have never gone to a Kael raid for
faction without asking permission, and when I have been told to stay
away, I've done just that. Aside from not wanting lag or not trusting
strangers to not ninja or KS (if there are enough of them), you never
know when someone will do something stupid. On a pickup raid I
attended for faction, a giant was pushed up on a ledge. Everyone was
told to back off and everyone did, except for one lone pet who kept
tanking him on the wall and being summoned back when the owner got
around to trying /back off. Raid leader was screaming for the pet to
be killed, while some others were laughing and cheering for the pet.
Wonder what they would have said if the pet had knocked the giant over
the wall and started a train or something? And then there's always the
risk of someone nuking too soon and drawing aggro they shouldn't.
Ping pong in EQ is not my idea of fun and I am sure it isn't fun for
the raid that is actually there to accomplish something either.
