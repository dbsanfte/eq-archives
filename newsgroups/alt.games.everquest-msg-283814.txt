If it worked like you said... of course it would have been successful.

No doubt you guys are "good necros" and I don't doubt what you say is true. 
However.. this necro was NOT the savior you have described. Not only was 
he/she NOT being effective in kills... the necro in this case did little of 
anything beneficial to the group.  As in any class, there are good and bad 
players. This one was ineffective. I am not insulting necros as a class. But 
this particular one sucked.

And I know it may sound like a contradiction (bringing the druid issue into 
this) but I really was NOT the one whining for med breaks. The druid was 
(repeatedly). Although I did get low mana a few times when a nice mind 
breeze would have been helpful... I was never in such a bind I needed the 
druid heals. If the druid had been fighting and snaring as he should, he 
would not have needed the med breaks. If he would have not constantly 
undermined my spells... I could have had more mana. It is a real waste to 
cast a CH on someone at 90 health. Yet he would not communicate, by hot 
button or in grp chat. I would have much prefered he wait until I asked for 
the help and we work together... but he seemed to do his own thing. (He also 
did not seem to get the concept of ML... The whole grp was getting 
frustrated as he'd "forget" and keep looting... grrrrr)

Thanks for your comments. I have learned much more about necros than I knew 
before!
