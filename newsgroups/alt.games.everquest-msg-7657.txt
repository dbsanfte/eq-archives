    This is not entirely true.

    I, for example, cannot start a train, under any circumstances, in Black
Burrow.

    I blast a train with AOE nukes, the train dies.  Nothing else comes up,
nothing survives to be pissed off, nothing is drawn by my weapons fire.  The
only thing that happens is many mobs die (who are already at the entrance)
and the handful that don't turn and either run... where they heal up and...
or come at me and proceed to swing until I finish them off.

    Why does it happen like this?

    The ENTIRE zone is green to me.

    Nothing aggros to help anything attacking or attacked by me because
everything (including the zone boss) in Black Burrow is afraid of me.

    It has been like that for at least 9 levels, when I know I went down
there to test out my new 29th level spells, and scowered the zone looking
for a MOB that I didn't kill with a single blow so that I could check the
secondary effects of a spell.  But that day is another, quite amusing, set
of stories.

    The point is at 29, you can safely do whatever the heck you want in
Black Burrow, because the normal rules of aggro no longer apply.

    I believe that this condition existed for me before 29... but I do not
have absolute prefect recall of being too uber for the zone prior to the day
that I punched an Elite in the nose with a bare fist (to do only 1 point...
because he wouldn't survive if I did much more than that when I hit him with
the spell I was testing) and then WALKED up top with him in tow to root him
in the open air to test fire stuff at him (/saying "don't attack this elite,
don't help me" the whole time so that he didn't aggro on anyone elsse, and
THEN cause a train because his little dog faced buddies would run in to help
him kill a lower level char).

    25 might be too low to be train proof in BB... but not by much.
