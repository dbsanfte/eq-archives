I would recommend for starters going the Shaman/Warrior duo route too.  If
you are barbarians, you have good newbie hunting grounds in Everfrost, can
easily zone over to BB for some goblin hunting, and then move on the Karanas
in your teens as just some very basic progression through the ranks (with
EQ, all sorts of possibilities exist outside of that simple suggestion) ....
I've played with a couple that have this combo before and they have a blast
....

Hope you have fun!
