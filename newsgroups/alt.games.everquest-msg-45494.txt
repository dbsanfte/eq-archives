i was recently thinking of setting up a timer /wait function hot key.

say you wanna know when 60 seconds have passed.

/say wonder when 60 seconds is up.
/wait 600
/say 60 seconds is now up.

depending on how versatile the /wait function is and if you can do anything
while the /wait is in function, it would be useful.  I guess I'm looking for
an online timer that you don't have to use /time for.  maybe i just need to
invest in a stop watch.  ROFL
