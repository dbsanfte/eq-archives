Actually, if the are a derivative work (up for debate, IMO) they are
copyright VI/Sony AND the person who drew 'em.  In other words, if
they really are derivative, the person who drew 'em can be stopped
from distributing them, but VI/Sony also cannot use 'em without
permission of the person who actually drew the maps.  It's a shared
ownership, as was discovered back in the days of TSR and their rather
draconian policies against AD&D works on the internet.

Probably irrelevant, but I thought it bore mentioning.
