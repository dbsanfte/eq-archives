Each pulse of Bard charm lasts no longer than 18 seconds at
any level. Each cast of Enchanter charm can last up to 8
minutes (although rarely that long at low levels) up to Dire
Charm which is theoretically permanent.

There are situations where Enchanter charm is useful or even
necessary in exp groups. As a 60 Cleric, I have, in the
olden days, duo-ed Upper Kobold in Velketor's Labyrinth with
just a 60 Enchanter as my partner. Obviously, charming as an
Enchanter adds a level of complexity to crowd control since
your pet will spontaneously and without warning break your
charm periodically, and even when it is under control, the
pet may break or prevent you from mezzing adds properly.

When I play my 53 Bard, I generally only use Charm when
there is no Enchanter in the group. Properly watched and
timed, Bard charm can be an asset to a group, without
putting the party in too much jeopardy. However, a bad Bard
is an Enchanter's worst nightmare.
