Actually this IS the main reason that I use PST, I have had numerous
occasions where someone would send me a tell and say, "well answer me" or
something to that effect, because i usually do my auction and turn off
auction and the idiot will try to ask how much my item is or whatever IN
auction.  So I always put PST after my auction.  It souldnt bother anyone
that there are 3 tiny letters behind the auction=)
