Given the time and effort invested to become qualified to be a rocket
scientist, their work is worth more than a burger slinger. They'd be
justified in complaining about working for minimum wage. Practically
any joe off the street can flip burgers, so min wage or close to it is
the "market value" of their work. The burger flipper can't even take
extra pay (tips) from a customer who is willing to pay it and feels
their work is worth it (They'll get fired for it).

The product's rarity and quality determine it's worth. Same as an
employee's.
