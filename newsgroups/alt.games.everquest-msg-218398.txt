    This has been done to death. 

   The reason I prefer bottom posting is that if you top post, and I
care about what you are saying, the flow of your post is that I read
what you wrote, then scroll down to see the context.  Often, the top
part won't make much sense until you see the context, so then I would
scroll back up to read it again with it's new relevance.  It takes more
time, it is awkward, and annoying.  

   I rarely bother.  I see top posting, I just tab through to the next
reply.  You could be adding delightfully relevant and interesting posts,
for all I know.  If you insist on using a format that makes it that
inconvenient for me to read, I figure you don't really want to be read
at all.
