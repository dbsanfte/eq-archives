	According to analysis on the Glade, a Wurmslayer is superior in output to
either a Rat Whip or a Lamentation until level *58*, at which point the other
two weapons barely edge it out.

	What level is your Ranger?

	Now that we have better armor than Thorny Vine (I walked into Fear the
first time with better AC than Rangers used to have leaving it for good) and
the Defense points we should have had when Kunark went live, sure.

	Prior to that, no.  Using a Ranger as a tank in places like Karnor's or
Sebilis, around (say) the release of Kunark, was at best a major drain on the
group's kill rate.  At worst it meant a wipeout.

	The primary issue with Rangers as tanks (even now) is less one of AC than
it is HP.  Rangers have to be healed too often, meaning you have to use
smaller, less efficient spells.  Your healers run out of mana faster; you
spend more time medding and less time killing.  

	Of course, this has bugger-all to do with Wurmslayers.

	No.  It has virtually no taunt to it whatsoever.  I was able to swing away
with mine with total impunity.  I found that, while using a Wurmslayer, I
could not taunt off a healer or Enchanter who drew agro to save their lives.
I got in the habit of keeping my EE bag open during combat so I could swap in
the Rat Whip when I needed to draw agro.

	Actually no; the proc doesn't work 95% of the time.  It's blocked or
overwritten by just about every slow spell in the game.
