}move her faction up a good deal with the Benevolence line of spells, and she
}(obviously) is well above the CHA cut-off. Above Indifferent there is no
}change in the prices vendors offer to her. She's been using a Diamond

}prices.

Close, but not quite.  At the higher faction levels, the CHA cutoff point 
decreases.

}like to meet them. ;-)

I'm probably getting close... Amiable in most of Paineel now, after 33 
million kobolds. :)
