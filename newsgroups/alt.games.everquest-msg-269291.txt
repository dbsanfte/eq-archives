For any that didnt know about this (Like me)

First I was a tad sceptical on this, but it *ACTUALLY WORKS*

Formats...

For EverQuest users - [tell EQ2.<servername>.<playername> <message>

For EverQuest2 users - /tell EQ.<servername>.<playername> <message>

Keep in mind, for the areas with the <> around the area, that is where
you put the selected server and player you are trying to contact!

So for those who thought they were losing good online friends because
of a game switch from EQ to EQ2, it is time for you to rejoice!
