Well, if they're talking about transparency, as in seeing the sky flickering
through the ground, it hasn't been fixed.  Only way I can play without
getting a migrane is to keep the sky turned off.

If they're talking about transparency as in seeing through the clothing of
the new Luclin character models, then /boggle....as the Intel 810 chip users
have a hard enough time with the Old World now, makes me wonder how any of
them can play with Luclin installed and the character models turned on?
