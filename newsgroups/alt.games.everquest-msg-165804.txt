Sigh**

I had a character called Bonehand, who I deleted and then tried to recreate
as a different race/class (I've done this a couple of time before, just
playing around to get a feel for the different types of character) and the
nameserver wouldn't allow me to re-create using the name that I'd been using
for several months.

There must be a new name nazi with too much free time at Sony these days me
thinks.
