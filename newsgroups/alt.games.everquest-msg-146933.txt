Show me somewhere where Verant says that lightning blast/FOK was designed
for group play only, or stop making unsubstantiated claims. Also please
explain how quadding "ruins the hunting of others". Dont tell me its cos
"they use up all the mobs" either. That happens in plenty of places where
theres no quadding (RM for example, or even loio on a bad day).

How do you get your xp. Root kite? (lol, u might make 60 in the next
century) Leach off a group?
