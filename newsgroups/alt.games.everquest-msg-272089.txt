I use to have this problem also (being a pred myself).  What I did was
gave up the first 'big' hit and went with a pull move instead.  Use
arrows, or the best (because of the range) is Stalk.  That will pull
the mob and the groups that are hoarding them won't even know how you
pulled the mob (no visible effects from Stalk).  After that, get
Swindler's Luck going, then hit with Cheap Shot.  While the mob is
stunned, stop the auto-attack, hit Stalk again, and use a big hit.  It
takes some practice to get down (especially if you need to swing behind
him before the stun wears off), but keep at it.  Doing that will allow
you to pull, and still beat the badguys even without starting with a
big hit.

Seeing that you are a pred makes the frustration at soloing more
understandable.  I can take few reds/yellows (turtles in EL), but more
whites, and then even more blues/greens.  It just takes more practice
since going toe-to-toe HURTS.  Make sure you work on good techniques,
and are chowing down on good food/drinks (not the vendor or summoned
stuff) that is appropriate to your level.
