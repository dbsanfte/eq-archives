If you got a WAR in the group he should taunt all the time to keep agro.
That's his job to hold agro.
Here is what I do in a group as a ranger.
- Snare towards the end of the fight, snare generate BIG agro (if not in
a Fear Kitting situation).
- If the ranger is the puller, dont pull with snare but with arrows.
- Once the mob is pulled to the camp dont run into it right away, let
the Tank fights it for a few seconds to build agro
- I usually stand on the side of the mob or behind and let the WAR/Tank
in the mob's face. If there is Rog in the group stand on the side as the
Tank but stay sligthly behind the Tank.
- I cast DS on the WAR/Tank NOT on myself.
- If I get agro, atk off, run towards the tank and try to keep the tank
between me and the mob. Dont run towards the healer in the group.
