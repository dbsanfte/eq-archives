Seriously? They must have waited a long time to edit the spell description 
then, because perhaps the biggest reason I never considered using it was 
that I didn't care for the prospect of getting smacked by a wandering mob 
and losing it and having to try and channel through SoW while getting 
beaten down - well that and the fact that it took so long to refresh after 
memming it. I could just never justify a spell slot for it when I could 
simply cast SoW and then mem something else.
