I"ll tell you why I don't like to group with necros: its because I
feel useless.  They don't need heals, roots, fears, and put my
nukes to shame; plus they can snare (which I flat out can't)
and their pet more than covers any meager melee contribution
I could make.

I'll tell you why I don't like to group with necros: its because
in a group they are useless.  I can heal, root, fear, nuke, and
melee, plus I can stun (which they flat out can't) and the
group would be better served with a wizard, ranger, or
druid snarer, rather than a jack of all trades master of none.

I'll tell you why  I don't like to group with necros: its because
they are evil and I am good.

I'll tell you why I don't like to group with necros: its because
hardly any of em embrace the evil that they are, they act
nicer than any three mages!

I'll tell you why I don't like to group with necros, its because
they are so good at soloing that they have practically no
experience at grouping.

I'll tell you why necros have no experience with grouping, its
because noone will group with them, so they -have- to solo.

I group with necros all the time, actually... turns out that my
best use of mana 90% of the time is to celestial the necro
so he can lich up more mana fast.

I group with necros all the time, actually... they make great
mana sources for me, so I can heal, nuke, stun, and so forth
all the more... like having a second cleric in the group, only
they also bring a pet!
