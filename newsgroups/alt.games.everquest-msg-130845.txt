I hate top posting, but I don't feel like fixing this half-witted top post
conversation and if I bottom post here it'll just confuse the hell out of
people.

If you'd actually LOOK at the links you're spewing out, you'd notice that
they don't have the information he wants.  Allakhazam's velious armor page
DOESN'T HAVE BEASTLORDS ON IT YET!!!
