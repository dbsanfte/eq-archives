How about, "that is so gay" (or "ghey" -- do they feel guilty typing
gay?")

I had a new druid ask me if I thought his hat looked "gay".  I told
him I didn't know any gay people that ever wore a hat like that, so I
didn't know.

The most annoying is "ne" for "any".  The users must have incredibly
low energy to not be able to type that one extra letter.  I kept
wondering "Northeast what?" 

"Yur" must be a catch-all for people that don't know the difference
between "your" and "you're" -- it seems most people don't know the
difference!
