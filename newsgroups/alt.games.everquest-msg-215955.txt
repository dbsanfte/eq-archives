    I've been pleasantly surprised by how good the "normal loot" items have
been on normal with level 65 party. Things like the AC 57 plate BP, the
Vengeance II ranged item, the INT/WIS 5 HP/MANA 50 ring, the
better-than-OotIV shield-that-looks-like-knuckledusters from Guk - there's
some stellar stuff in these places. And at hard difficulty, the quality goes
through the roof. My guildmates have gotten things like 15/21 BS mod
daggers, 75 HP/90 MANA masks with Haste of Solusek, all sorts of amazing
drops.
