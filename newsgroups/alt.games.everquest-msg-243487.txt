They'd be flushing whatever credibility their game had left down the toilet.
Ignoring the fact that that service itself pretty much tells you that most
of the game and nearly all of its content isn't worth playing, they'd now
have a real economic incentive to make the non-endgame as boring and joyless
as possible, just as they would have an economic incentive to nerf loot
drops across the gameworld.

Just think what that would look like to an average player if they did that
and then nerfed back the ZEM of some of the higher ZEMs in the game.  Think
about how it would look whenever they nerf a drop that sells well, or nerf
massive platinum farms.

And think about the case of a player who doesn't buy their stuff, and finds
himself several times less powerful than everyone his level who did spend RL
cash on their characters and equipment.  Think he'd be having fun playing?
