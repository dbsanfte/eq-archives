First, necros *do* get an invis spell at level 8, called Gather Shadows.
It's a self-only invis, but it's good enough for he POK mask quest.

Second, I'm guessing you mean Cloudy Potions rather than Swirling Smokes.
Cloudy Potions are the vendor-sold 1 charge invisibility potioins.

Definitely worth checking out for casters and hybrids. Haven't been there
since the revamp though. Hope non-gaters can still get out if invisible.
