I have been caught again, and I am guilty as charged but only for having a life.

I can't stay glued to my computer because of work, family/home responsibilities and my home based
business. I appologize for treading into your tight little world here and will not do it again. This
venue is an area I have always used for getting/giving info even way back in the bad old days of DOS
it is too bad there is so much cynicism here.

Yourself and bonda took this info request and twisted it into something to entertain yourselves,
that is not right in the real world but here .....? I see I am called a troll, interesting how the
lurkers will jump on something like that and then scurry back into their holes immediately after. I
thank Darren for his input, I have been in touch with the reporter from the Seattle Times and it
appears there is way more here then Verant/SOE is admitting to but don't let this worry you. It is
propably a good idea that you stay right where you are with your head buried in your computer and
totally ignore both the possibilities and the world around you.

I don't have to worry about my son not being able to play this crazy game he loves so much because
of my unwillingness to put my card info online again. This is  because SOE is offering Pre-paid 90
day subscriptions available at a few computer gaming/store outlets. This takes care of my immediate
problem but I do still have to take a step back and ask why is SOE doing this.

To the Bizbee's and Bonda's of this group........ Good Luck
to the lurkers......... Think and form your own opinions, don't let the bizbee's and bonda's
influence you.
To the Darrens........ Thanks, 

Bye
GM
