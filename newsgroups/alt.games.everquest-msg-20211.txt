Don't think so. I agree that people calling themselves
'Rambo' or 'Rocky' or 'Aircarrier Supreme' and all the
really lame 'Ihityou' etc names disrupt the fantasy 
setting and make it real hard getting into sliding
yourself into a (made up, as eq doesnt provide much there)
atmosphere.

Both are ok to me .. I don't mind composite names, as all
players are 'special' and not the normal kind of inhabitant
of the world. It's not like every farmer on Norrath would
be called 'Shan Stormsinger' etc. Actually I wonder why
some people mind composite names ... look at history, there's
a ton of Lionhearts, Ironfists and XYZ, the manslayer. Names
like John SMith are for the farmer, who doesn't show up in EQ.
(at least not as long we all got enough CPU power to simulate
a whole city alive).

Some sre good. But I agree, I have to hit the button very often.
I think the other guy's idea was to keep names of a certain folk
(i.e. Iksar etc) within a certain scope. An Iksar called
'Happy Joyrider' just breaks the setting for me, too. Iksar just
are the kind of people named 'Ssitsak' and 'Shakeruliz' to me now :)

True, but people grown up in Vietnam are rarely called
'Philippe de la voie'. There's some kind of distinct ringing
to people from a certain area.
