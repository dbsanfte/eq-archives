In a way I can agree, it's much easier to avoid idiots by their names.

The OP's name on the other hand I'd not have thought about twice about,
shame he lost it, although in pronouncing the name it can read as Mick
Jagger, it can also read as MC Jagger (which I guess is also against the
naming policy, it just doesn't bother me) it's one of the more inventive
ones.

Havusin Maweena is about as original as Seymour Butts.
