ROFL, I suspect that most of us have figured out by now that you
don't suffer _anything_ gladly.  What Rumbledor missed is that
your attitude here is quite consistent with other opinions you've
defended at length.  VI has been quite clear on the subject, and
you accept their ruling.  Period.  To summarize:
- the rules are clear,
- the OP was not in any way in violation of the rules,
- the "victim" was acting like an idiot and so deserving of no sympathy.
Looks amazingly like your position on name /petitioning to me.

Have I understood you correctly?
