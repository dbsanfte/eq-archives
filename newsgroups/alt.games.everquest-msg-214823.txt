Unfortunately seems not to be not the case. The spells exist, but do not
work on all traps.

There are several kinds of traps. There are different ways to remove the
different traps.

WIS casters can remove "cursed" traps. INT casters can remove a second
type, and rogues can remove a third (mechanical traps, I think).

In practice I haven't seen a cursed trap yet. When I've tried the cleric
spells, they've always told me that the spell could only be used on a
cursed object. On the other hand, when grouped with a rogue the rogue has
always been able to deal with the trap.

Others' experience may differ... there's a thread about this on the
eqcleric forums at the moment.
