Sit tight on your cash until you have 100pp or so, and buy a Giant
Militia Longsword (11/39, magic) - or keep checking vendors,
especially in Kaladim, I've repeatedly found them there for 7pp or
less, sold by players too impatient to auction them. The same 100pp
(or less) should get a Crystal Fiber (8/26, magic) if you prefer a
faster, less damaging weapon.

If you can put together 300pp or so (quite possibly less, I've seen
them on The Rathe for 100pp), get a Crystalized Blade (13/31, magic,
paladin and shadow knight only) - this will hold well into your low
20s. (Note that this is different from the Crystaline Blade, 11/38 -
not what you had in mind).
