So there I was, up in POK selling off about 6 dime bags of bronze
swords the guards of Nektulous had been generous enough to leave
me in their wills, when a call came out for more people for a COM
group, levels 30 to 40.  Hey, I'm 30... so I offer my admittedly
limited services, and they go for it.

I ask if they have a porter or if I should run, and they suggest
I run.  I'm halfway there when the second tell comes, "lol".

I guess they didn't consider that a possibility, but unsowed it
still only takes a couple minutes to run to COM from POK, and
half of that is ever so carefully easing myself down the
cliffside in EJ.

So I set up in COM and equip my pet with every summons I can
think of, not that it will help much if he becomes MA, but they
are still showing up as in POK so I know I'll have time to get
the mana back anyway.

Eventually they all trickle into the zone and I get an invite.
Then we get trained, I'm dead, group takes a while to get things
figured out.  Eventually I get a rez, after talking to the
anonymous little dwarf who invited me, presumably a cleric then.

Killed again within seconds, I'm halfway back to the COM when I
get asked where I am and tell the cleric I"m dead again.

Then we get trained another three or four times, pushed out of
the zone entirely a couple of those, fight and kill two of the
four mobs that train us one of the other times.  Its ugly.

Noone ever says one word in the group, its all tells and says,
like we are keeping things from the members of the group that are
dead or on the other side of the zone line (a frequent occurance
due to the trains).

Finally we seem to be all together, there's a new group
member.... I start summoning yet another pet.... and poof, we
zone to POK.  Group splits up and I log out.

I'm sitting here wondering what (besides the fact that COM seems
to be the new Grand Central Station, a title Karnors has always
held in my mind) went on, why nobody was talking or announcing
pulls or explaining that they were rezzing or getting us a port
out or anything at all...when I realize the awful truth.

I'm playing on Firiona Vie.  Recently, a friend logged on and I
was working on training up her Elvish while I learned some Vah
Shir from her.  This means that we were grouped, but chatting in
tells (did you know if you put a semicolon before a tell it gets
around language problems?) while using group says to spam away in
the respective languages for skill ups.... with group chat
filtered off so as to not have to see all the spam.

Its been a couple days, but I group so rarely I hadn't noticed I
had group chat off!

Splendid One, deaf 30 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
