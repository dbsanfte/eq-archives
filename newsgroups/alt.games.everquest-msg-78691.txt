Further.. if you then bind one of your movement keys (W) to the same as one
of your user defined keys which you have your... say... Sense Heading skill
on.. then you are practicing every time you move forward.
I've used this technique with the following social bound to my forward,
backward, left and right movement:
/doability 1 (sense heading)
/doability 2 (forage)
/loc (gives me current loc)

Never get lost or go hungry. ;)
