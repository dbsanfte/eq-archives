I'm going to have to reply with a Dogbert-like "Bah" to anyone who
claims EverQuest isn't addictive.  The subject of addiction is an
interesting one and I can only recommend you do some research on it
and discover what makes things addictive and why EverQuest falls into
that category when other things like, say, softball, don't.
