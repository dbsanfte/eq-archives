Had you replied to someone who said "I don't like PvP because everybody 
is an asshole and it sucks in every way", and said "I think you're 
painting it that way *because*...", it would have been a brutally honest 
*opinion*.  What you did was paint most of age with the same brush 
without knowing what their reasons were.  Personally, I stumbled onto a 
random server without knowing what the hell it was.  When I finally knew 
enough of the game to know what that meant, I was already firmly 
entrenched in my server with many friends, and had had quite enough 
experiences, as Jekke said, with idiots on non-PvP to be completely NOT 
interested in finding out what they could do in a basically FFA 
environment.

So what say we each play the game the way we like, and not act better-
than-thou because our names are printed in a different color.
