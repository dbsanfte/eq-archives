Because then you start doing sanity checks, port assignment logs, adding
code to LD handling routines, etc...  The amount of I/O and cross-server
overhead would rise (I think) significantly.  It might work for low
traffic servers, but not some of the ones with traditionally large
populations.  It's much easier and much less expensive to just let the
receiving server assign the "next" available port in it's available
range.
