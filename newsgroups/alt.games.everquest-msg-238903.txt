You mean that every player has an obligation to know how an item is made
or where it is dropped? If I see an item for 20k in the bazaar I assume
it's hard enough to get that it's worth 20k. If that isn't the case, then
Sony should make the drops more rare or change the difficulty of the recipe,
instead of changing items bought by an innocent third party.

They've let lots of items remain in the game while changing how often/if it
drops, sometimes changing stats of the new item that drops (moss covered
twig, circlet of shadow et cetera), I don't see why they couldn't have done
it here. Are those 5/11 weapons so unbalancing that they can't stay in the
game? I think not.

For the record, I don't even know what the weapon is question is, how it's
made or anything else, so this doesn't affect me in any way.
