There's also an area full of Walruses and Men of War in the SW part of the
zone that might be good.  I think the Walruses there might still be blue
at 52.

Another good spot is straight out from the Kael ramp.

Is a soloing Beastlord constantly busy, or are the med breaks where you
sit on your ass for several minutes?  If so, one warning: Death Squad.
Going AFK is a risk in that zone.  The Death Squad sees through invis.
