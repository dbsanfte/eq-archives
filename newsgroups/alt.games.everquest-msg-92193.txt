Try eastern wastes in velious. I did my thirties there, pulling stuff
(mostly snow dervs) back to either side of the bridge. It's a great zone
for druids. Lots of wide open, dead spots to kite in. Lots of animal
mobs. No undead to see through camo. Easy access from the iceclad or gd
rings. Reasonably easy to get a group, if you really want one, and the
soloing is top notch for a druid. I suggest dervs, cats, and wolves in
your thirties, ulthorks, giants, orcs and bigger animals (walruses,
mammoths, rhinos) in your forties, and rhinos, manticores, ulthork man
'o wars and some giants in your early fifties.
