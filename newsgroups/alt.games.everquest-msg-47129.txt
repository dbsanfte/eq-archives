    The "level 51" assertion does not jibe with your later comment:

    I can understand why - they're reaching the "end game" faster than any
old timer EVER could, and they're doing it on the backs of the old timers.
More further down.

    Jakugg knows all the rules for getting XP: steady stream of low blues,
with as little downtime as possible. Avoid anything that could kill you, or
even make you take a "med break".

>Where do I suggest you pull even cons? I mentioned them not at all. There
>are low blues in dungeons too and they tend to have fewer HP,

    They usually come in pairs or more, at least when you're breaking. That
means you require crowd control, and furthermore this crowd control must
work in confined spaces. Lower HPs doesn't help if you have to chew through
twice as many mobs in a pull. You also didn't mention one of the big reasons
indoor mobs have fewer HPs: there's a ton more caster mobs indoors. Dealing
with caster mobs means stuns, resists, and a game plan. Not so melee-class
mobs - pull, slow, kill.

> not hit as hard

    His outdoor mobs hit for nothing - they get Feared, and look back
infrequently. Again, lower downtime. There's a reason why these outdoor
groups fly up in levels despite having inbalanced groups, long pull times,
and having to fight mobs with more HPs in zones with lower ZEMs.

    Well, you got half of that right - they're a liver, as opposed to
someone who likes to die a lot. Balance is a LOT more important in a dungeon
setting - without crowd control, for example, a two-mob pull does the damage
of three single pulls in the time it takes to kill them. That means more
downtime, even if HPs are lower. And that's assuming you survive the
encounter. A necromancer can be healer outdoors - heck, BANDAGES can do the
job outdoors if you know what you're doing. Indoors? Forget it - have a
healer or else. And escape? Outdoors, run with SoW, pull to a zone line, or
just Fear the damn mobs away and go zone. Indoors? Train and pray, or evac.

    Again, Jakugg knows the score. Dungeons that are even remotely
reasonable to do are packed with folks who want to do them. The ideal
situation is being in an empty zone, with nobody to fight over pulls with or
cross pulls with - and that describes outdoor Kunark zones at Jakugg's level
quite well.

>Everybody is crammed into Velketors Labyrinth these days. SolB can
sometimes
>be a little crowded.

    Sol B can be a nightmare, though. I love the zone, but some nights you
zone in and it's a zoo. Fungi soloists are claiming Pool and Bats, a failed
Efreeti raid is using a monk to CR to zone-in, and some fatty is AFK at
zone-in unshrunk. Anyone who you could get a group with was long ago trained
out, and is sitting outside naked waiting to be able to zone in and drag
quickly to Circle for a res. And the first time you zoned in past all these
folks to check on things, two Sonic Bats and two Lava Guardians just inside
the zone immediately proved to you how much they hate Trolls like you that
ruined their lands.

    The biggest problem these days with Sol B is that fungi soloists "claim"
what used to be a fine camp for three or more people, like Pool or Bats. So
people don't stay to form groups elsewhere, and the dungeon ends up
supporting far fewer people than it could.

>Guk Liveside has always been empty

    Heh. On my server, King is fairly frequently camped, Eye will be farmed
by Qanan or an alt of Qanan, and Raster is camped by some poor sod. At
Jackugg's level that really leaves Live side fort (is that still blue?),
which one needs to learn to pull effectively. And some of his support staff,
like Tiru, will be less than pleased at going KOS in Upper and being swarmed
by garbage any time they wish to return to LGuk. He'll also need to find
people who can crowd control and snare - his usual core crew seems to be
WAR, ROG, CLR.

>Sebilis rarely has more than 30 people

    Seb requires him to find other party members that make up a balanced
group. Requires. At minimum, if he wants any sort of safety he'll require
snare, mez-level crowd control capable of handling at least as many adds as
a bard can handle, slowing or mana acceleration, and evac capabilities. He
CAN get multiple functions from one person (ENCH gives crowd control and
slow/mana acceleration, for example), but he'll still likely need two more
folks minimum from specific classes to match the XP over time he'll get
outside.

>HS has never ever been crowded.

    HS is a pain to get to and hellish to CR from. Remember, minimizing the
hassle a death causes makes up for just about ANY zone XP modifier you can
name - especially when the zone in question is a coffin-CR zone with a
hostile zone-in.

    And with the secondary market for items being as deflated as it is, you
can usually afford to do just that AND have solid gear for your level.

    He's good enough for a raid.

    No, I'm serious. Even the most avid outdoorsman learns how to /assist.
What else do you learn in a dungeon that is crucial on a 30 plus person raid
with others who know what they're doing? Take Jakugg, troll warrior. He
pulls in a dungeon - not on a raid. In a dungeon, he does everything in his
power to get and hold aggro - he has to learn a whole new set of aggro
control techniques when he raids, depending on who they want tanking and
when. Loot? The items he earns on raids will eclipse what he could buy in
EC, even if he had dungeon cash. Raiding requires only a few people to truly
know what to do, and a lot of people to just do what they're told (at lower
raid levels). So what does he need these 'leet dungeon skillz for?

    I've been a dungeon cleric all my career. Even when outdoors, I've gone
places that have the feel of a dungeon - Unrest, High Pass/Keep, Drolvarg
Temple in FV, Karnor's. Places where fear kiting wasn't an option, where you
need the same sorts of crowd control skills as in true dungeons. I felt that
the skills I was learning would help me in the end. Then I started raiding -
Hate, ToV, Velk's. And quickly found out that those dungeon skills, with the
exception of /assist, were not used on raids. It's pretty disappointing.
