You hit the nail on the head.

It

1) turns your name purple

2) makes you anon but still shows your guild tag if you have one (but
no longer your level or zone)

3) makes people laugh when you have it on but are not roleplaying in
the least

4) lets your guild still see you in /who all GUILD but not your class,
level or where you are
