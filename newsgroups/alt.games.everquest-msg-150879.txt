I'm guessing that after the folks went LD, the mob was left with
entries in its hate list like:
    "charname3, did XX points of damage to me, is an NPC"

After they got back, their additional damage probably went on the
same table entry, still flagged as an NPC.

At the end of the fight, the "NPCs" had done more damage than
the folks who were still considered PCs.  Either that, or
"charname3" got the killing blow, and was still flagged as
an NPC in the mob's hate list -- *poof*

Or maybe you just killed him in water that was
too shallow or too close to the surface.  I know
I've had underwater mobs poof on me (even solo)
when they died, because the game was confused
as to whether it was actually still underwater or not.
As a result, I always make sure I kill underwater
mobs in deep water areas, well under the surface.
