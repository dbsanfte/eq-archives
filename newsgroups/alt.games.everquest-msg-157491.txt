Every guild is different, as different as every guild leader. But in
general, if it's a raiding guild, I'd say you screwed up. Nothing wrong
with asking once, I suppose. But bucking the decisions of the officers
is your first poor move. You point out that you were well aware that the
guild's rules specifically call for them to raid and you to participate.
Frankly, there's probably a good chance that the officers are currently
looking askance at your trial membership status, IMO.

What you wanted was totally natural. But a guild can be a very military
environment, particularly in the raiding guilds. Recruits who rock the
boat, make waves, and buck against instructions and policy don't exactly
start off shining.

If you're a natural explorer and like leveling and xp groups and such,
maybe a raiding guild isn't for you and you might consider removing
yourself before they do it for you.
