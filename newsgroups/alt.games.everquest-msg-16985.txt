As I don my bard-flame resistant armor, let me add the following:
While bards are a wonderfully versatile class that can bring a lot to
the table in many group situations, trying to make them act as a primary
healer in a group of *their own* levels is insanity. The healing
capability of a 31 bard vs a 31 cleric is, well..... not great. Trying
to then make him/her the only healer for a warrior ten levels higher
fighting challenging mobs.........
  The fault lies on two sides here, sadly. Did you *really* think there
was any chance that was going to work? My 39 warrior currently is
travelling with a 32 <cleric> and she's generally OOM after any fight
where I get one or two more blues (to me, that is) than expected. Great
news for the clerics alteration skill (or whichever one healing is, I
forget) but it makes for some dicey fights.
  The warrior may not have been too bright in this story, but you were
equally off the beam by not just saying "no thankyou" and continuing to
look for a fuller group more suitable to your level.
