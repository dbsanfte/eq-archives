NO! Please stay in the sewers THERE IS A CITY THERE!

It is called "The Shrine" it is guarded by FOUR Spectres but they wont aggro
on you :)

The city has guild leaders of clerics, necromancers, SKs, Warriors,
Enchanters but you have to be evil.

It has a banker there merchants etc. You get to it either by A) Going into
the warrior animal prision area you can zone into it inside of the cages or
you can look around for a false walls and it will have a bunch of strange
symbols all over it it is around there someplace...
