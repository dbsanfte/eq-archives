Apparently not. By DT's statement, you are only soloing if you are the
only person in the zone, and are nake or dressed in/using equipment that
you personally looted yourself. And dont' go buying any spells off any
vendors either, you cheaters! If you didn't research them yourself with
runes that you looted yourself, you're not soloing!

;-)

Oh, this is fun.
