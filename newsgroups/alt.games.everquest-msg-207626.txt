Most paladins think the top three choices are enchanter, shaman and druid,
in that order.  The higher you get, slowing the mob will become very
important in minimizing damage.  Shaman can slow a bit better, but you don't
get the mana regen and the healing function is sort of duplicated.

Me, I picked druid because I had a level 34 one at the time I got my second
box, and no shaman or enchanter.  I'm 61 now and the druid is 59.  We can
mow down non-PoP low dark blue mobs fairly easily, but the damage from mobs
really starts to pick up on higher blues.  But the druid still brings a lot
to the table: incomplete heal (58+), damage shield, hp regen, mana regen
(59+), fire and cold resists, mob strength and attack debuffs (though I'm
not sure these help a lot), snare, root, good ultra-low resist DoTs, direct
damage spells, evac, transportation utility (ports, sow, camo, lev, see
invis), atk buff outdoors (wolf form).  Whew! Did I miss anything?  Strength
buffs, stuns outdoors, AoE snare and DDs, blind, cure disease, poison and
curses etc.
