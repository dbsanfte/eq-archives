I  never even got close enough to him to even try.  All the Elves around him 
just keep slowing me down.  They are worse than the Death Beetles in Unrest 
and give just as much xp.
I have heard if you do get past them Santa has 9 different pet, one which 
will blind you with some strange red light.

Let me know if anyone can prove this or if it has been nerfed.
