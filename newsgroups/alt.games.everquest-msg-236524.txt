Even though the server of Morden Rasp has been *ruined* by transfers 
(other's words, not mine) I think that a new guild with a strong 
emphasis on role-play should be created there, once they start accepting 
guild apps.

I have a few themes in mind for at least 2 guilds with a basic story 
line, and they are basically formed from the story line of my two 
characters, Ragnarnok and Mephistio.

Mephistio, a Drow SK, and Ragnarnok, a Wood Elf RNG, are bitter rivals, 
and in a brutal and extremely competitive quest for a magical item, the 
ended up reaching the artifact at the same time. A battle ensued and 
they ended up dropping the artifact, shattering it into exactly ten 
million shards. As the magic of the item was scattred, it caused a 
chaotic worm hole of sorts and the elves' essences were switching into 
the other's body, Ragnarnok's spirit trapped in Mephistio's body, and 
Mephistio trapped in Ragnarnok's, and were then transported to the place 
their souls were bound (the escape the cities for the both of them is a 
much longer story then I will explain here).

While Rag (now Mephistio) is being smart and trying not to stir the 
waters too much so that somehow the mystics of Neriak find out his true 
identity, Mephistio (now Ragnarnok) is rallying a crowd of distraught 
and/or easy manipulated elves of all the 'lower' forms to create an army 
to take over Norrath for, as he claims, the Elven people, though he 
really wants Norrath only for himself, not even for Neriak.

The guid that Rag is trying to form is called the Order of the Pureblood 
Elves and only allows characters with elven blood in. The name is 
pureblood, however, there would be special occasions that a Half-Elf 
would be permitted to join (though they have to have a pretty good story 
plot for it to work).

Mephistio OTOH, is secretly trying to gather a counter-army, having 
heard of his nemisis' plans in a vision sent to him by Tunare. However, 
the only ones he can rally at this point in time to his cause is by 
convincing the evil races to defect to the lawful, more saavory side of 
the world (in other words, evil races/classes, playing as good guys). As 
the story is played through however, Mephistio's guild will accept 
member's of all races and classes to strenghten his "Shadows of Light" 
clan to destroy the Order of Pureblood Elves guild once and for all.

If this sounds like a fun and interesting set of guilds, and you would 
like to join one or the other, and maybe even help out starting up the 
guilds' story, events, getting recruits, and organizing some story 
material, please email me or send a tell to Ragnarnok or Mephistio on 
the Morden Rasp server. Please remember that these will be role-playing 
guilds. While we will have occasional OOC events and raids, there will 
be some PvP battles of both guilds fighting each other, in a story based 
environment. Anyone will be permitted to join the guild, if they can 
pass a role-play essay test that I will have organized through email 
submission on a website. Once some more of the details are fleshed out 
(such as a full charter, guild rules and requirements, etc.) I will post 
them here, and also make a guild site which I will also post the URL 
here, as well as several other EQ oriented forums.
