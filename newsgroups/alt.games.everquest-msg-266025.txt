That reminds me of another thing I sent feedback about.  I got a book when I
gained Freeport citizenship that I read.  After I read it, I noticed that
the option to read it went away on the context menu.  Furthermore, the quest
had no listed steps that appeared to require that book.  So, later, when I
ran out of inventory space while hunting, I destroyed the book.

And then, as I continued the quest, a new step appeared that told me to read
something from the book!  Oops.  I went back to where I had obtained the
book the first time, but was unable to get another (unless I remembered
wrong about where I had obtained the book!).
