i have a more controversial view here but im allowed as i have played the
game quite a bit in the past.
the online experience does rely on subscription, and this is encouraged
through a certain type of fear; losing friends youve know for so long,
devaluing of your current items,  keeping up with new trades/trends/gear. to
me, the relentless camping, clicking, dying etc is a strange form of
addiction which i was very much part of. but, its a beautiful world out
there -rl. to think all those hours gone
