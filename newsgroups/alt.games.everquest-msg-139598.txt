Are you dialling up from Europe somewhere?
If so (and this may count for other parts of the world) there is a router
down somewhere that is causing a problem. It was taking more than 5mins to
do the file check (btw if you cancel it then close down the patcher, EQ will
crash) and once in password auth and server selection took about 20seconds
each.

To Bristlebane I had a ping of 0 (Not sure how high the ping limit is for EQ
to display 0, somewhere over 1000...by my estimates my ping was in the 4 -
5000 mark) but to Antonious Bayle (and UK Q3 servers) my ping was around 150
(on a modem, awaiting ADSL) and quite playable.

A couple of friends, also in UK and both on Broadband, one cable one adsl,
had no problems whatsoever but I know some members of a Euro Guild had
similar issues to me. I tried various ISPs with no luck. This all started
around Saturday afternoon for me one moment my pings are 300 - 500 the next
0 on all PC's (Yes I can run 3 accounts sharing one modem dial up...strange
how I couldn't on 1 isdn channel, not so long ago) I doubt it'll be like
this for long, now weekend is over but the issue isn't with Verant.
