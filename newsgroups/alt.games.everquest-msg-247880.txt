High-DPS (a charmed pet or 2, and if you're really insane they're
hasted, but you need some good alternative CC or your chanters quickly
become a fine red mist) chain-pulling inner camps in BoT are best for
unflagged XP.  The XP in Nadox is quite disappointing, even with it
being a hot spot.  Forget about Luclin, mobs have too many HP for their
level to be worth it.  You want the highest level mobs with the fewest
HP, which means velk's is out with its lower level mobs.

SCM before anything else in archtype, for every caster (except maybe
shaman, think they need MC for Canni5, but then it's SCM next).  You'll
easily save more mana doing that than MC3 will provide.  Unless you
still find yourself going oom or dying a lot in groups, MC3 should
really wait a while. 

Don't waste AAs on stats, they'll come with gear anyway.  Stick to
archtype, PoP abilities and some GoD stuff if you want to avoid the
class AA title (though SCFM, Improved Familiar and Exodus are all nice
to have and would put you over the 24AA limit to keep Mistress). 
graffe.com seems to have a good AA guide (though the GoD stuff is
missing, it's all very high cost so you'll still probably get a lot more
for your XP with the lower cost archtype and PoP AAs for a long while).
