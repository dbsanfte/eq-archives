I wonder why that is? Could it be because there is no counter argument?
Nah , that couldn't be it.

The of course you are a Vegan and also have no leather products right?
Never kill a spider? Never step on an Ant? Ever use a disinfectant to kill
some germs?

Playing 'god' is done everyday by everyone that exists on this planet.

animals. The line cannot be drawn anywhere else. If you start to
draw that line anywhere within the animal kingdom the you are in
a whole world of trouble.
