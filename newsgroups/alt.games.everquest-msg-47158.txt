Really? I've never heard of a playing method that get's more xp faster
than chain pulling low blues. Since we're rarely in a full six person
group, taking on high blues and even cons leads to long fights and
occasional run to zone and/or die scenarios. Doesn't lead to fast xp
generation in my experience. Granted, you probably get an xp modifier
for being in a dungeon in some of those zones, but that only helps so
much. And any *popular* zone will often lead to dead time looking for
pulls, fighting with other groups pullers, etc. 
  No thanks. I would have to disagree. If you can blow off loot for a
while and are only looking to bull your way through a couple of tough
levels and generate xp, I'll take EJ any day in the high forties.
Usually the only people in the zone, and an unlimited supply of blues
close by a zone line in case it goes south.
