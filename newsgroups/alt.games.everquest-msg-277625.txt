1. Its happening now whether they like it or not
2. Its kind of like legalizing an unsavory activity - by making it
legal they hope to get rid of the bad elements involved by making it
more in the open (I do know of people that have paid money for goods
but have received nothing in return).
3. Sony is in business to make money, but this certaintly is a turn
around from their past position. Maybe there could be some other ways
to limit the eq sweat shops (i.e. you can't get more than 5 BoC a
month).
