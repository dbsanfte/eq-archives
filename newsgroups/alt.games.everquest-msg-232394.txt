You're right, he's wrong.

2 requirements to buy an item in camp A, at price X:

1. You have, at some time in the past, earned X points in that camp.  You 
only need to do this once.

2. You currently have X points to your name.

Let's say I wanted the 1496pt Ritual Claws of the Scion and the 1496pt 
casser chest from MM -  I earn my first 1496 points in MM and buy my claws,
I can then go anywhere to earn the next 1496 points to get my robe.
