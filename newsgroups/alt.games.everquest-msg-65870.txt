Fortunately, most of us here in the NG speculated -before- the patch that
this sort of thing would happen, thus seeming prescient, rather than
post partum prognosticators.

I agree, this is EQ2... or it will be when they finally get it rolled out.

It isn't necessary to be omniscient to predict trouble with a rollout of this
nature, why you yourself agree that problems where bound to erupt.
Question is, why didn't the bastiches test it, instead of releasing it
across all their servers simultaneously, in a heavily unwashed condition,
on its official release date?  I'm guessing its part of a relatively new
(been creeping up on us for a couple years) attitude on the part of
game companies; release on time no matter how entemelogically unsound
your product is, and fix it all in patches afterwards.

Bah, unless you have something specific, thats only going to slow down
the people working on  the problems.  On the other hand, the readers
of this newsgroup obviously have plenty of time to read or ignore our
drivel, pro-verant or contra.

Bitching is a good way of letting off steam, Venting, as it were.  This
is not a victorian society, its the web, where we can spit on the floor
and call the cat a bastiche.

Sadly, its not just a game, its a shared virtual reality... and many of my
friends are in there with me.  Just because our social interactions
are filtered thru the soda straw of everquest doesn't make them any
less real... and if you want to tell me that those people I"m "friends"
with may not in fact be real at all, I'll just fall back on the Turing test.
If I can't tell the difference, then there is no difference.
