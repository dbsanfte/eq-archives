Honestly, I don't remember what the actual letter of the law is on right 
of way in merge situations in my state, but I've always been of the 
opinion that if I'm in the lane being merged into, I need to make room 
for the merging traffic. It just seems to me that the choice between 
altering my speed and causing the merging vehicles to possibly have to 
stop, thereby all but eliminating their abiltity to *ever* merge under 
heavy traffic conditions, or continue through the end of their marked 
lane onto the unmarked shoulder or breakdown lane is a pretty easy one to 
make.

I typically try not to be in the lane being merged into when approaching 
a merge situation in an effort to make way for merging traffic. Where 
that's not possible, say if my own exit is very soon after the merge, I 
make way.
