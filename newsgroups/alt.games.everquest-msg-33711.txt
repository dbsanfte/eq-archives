 Yeah, that one. Not sure on the going market rate but from what I hear
(I know people that have equipped multiple twinks with the things) they
aren't all that rare of a drop. So if they are expensive now they should
be going down in price eventually. Being lore works to your advantage as
well if you can make it to SG. Can probably auction in zone and haggle
them below market price. 

 With the agi it adds up to 10ac I think. Forgot the formula for agi=ac.
Not too bad for a monk wrist piece. It doesn't appear to have a graphic
though last time I put it on.
