Fighting in Ssra, Comm 1. Went in fully buffed with two slots free for npc 
dots. First combat had an Arcanist dispell me and took out 5th buff slot 
only, which happened to be my Conviction . . . .  Rebuffed with own 
Natureskin ( yeah, no where near as good, but as a ranger best I had ) then 
went on to next snake which happened to be a Warlock. They also dispelled me 
and I lost my 12th slot buff, Clairvoyance. So, considering all my buffs had 
been refreshed and were in order of casting or receipt, there appeared to be 
no order of dispell. Fighting the named Dragons in WW, sure enough, they 
followed the dispell order of top to bottom, so was using a clicky effect of 
from the Telescopic Eyepatch as the Shrunken Goblin Skull wont stack with 
ranger attack buffs to save further dispells.

In all, not particularly helpful in answering original question, but best 
thing to do is carry a clicky or two just to even up the odds of not loosing 
the buffs you really need to keep ^shrug^
