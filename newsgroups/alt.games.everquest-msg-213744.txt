Agreed.  I usually Malos a mob on incoming, then cast Turgur's 
immediately when I can, standing next to the tank.  I have found that I 
get just a few too many resists in many places I xp in to not do some 
debuff, and, those same mobs are just as likely to resist malosinia as 
slow, so I use Malos.
