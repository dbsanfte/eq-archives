No need to go to a second hard-drive (tho it might help a little),
just dupe the EQ folder to another name.  That's what I do to run
both my accounts and I do not have the extreme start-up time you
mention for the second instance (and my system is quite a bit less
powerful than yours, although I should also note that I always run
with old models to avoid lag problems in Luclin, LoY, and LDoN,
even when I'm just running one instance).  The loss of the mouse
while loading/zoning is mostly unavoidable (if you are auto-running
towards a zone-line or waiting on a port to cast and switch to the
other instance before you zone you don't lose the mouse).  You don't
mention whether you have sound on or not, I long ago took martin's
suggestion and disabled sound for all instances of the game to
minimize lag.

I used to use EQW, but once SOE got windowed mode working decently
I stopped as I found EQW more annoying than windowed mode (don't
recall what the annoyances were, it's been a while).

Use two machines.  ;)

Aye, happiness is a good thing.  :)
