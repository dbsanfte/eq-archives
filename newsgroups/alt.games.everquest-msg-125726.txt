    Wow, I can't wait till I get BAOR.  Any day now, right?
    On a _completely_ unrelated note... as one progresses to the higher levels of the
game, how does one learn what spells do what?  Caster's realm?  Trial and error? 
Having one's guild leader threaten to toss you out on your ear if you don't get it
straight?  Now that I've finally settled down on a main, I'd rather no screw it up. 
Too bad, anyways.

Annie <--- pretending she knows what BAOR is.

-- 
My main on Firiona Vie:

By the side of Lenny, the Traveling Ogre Warrior.
Members of the Council of Mithril Dreams.
Teapray  -- High Elf Cleric, 23, poaching Gorillas in Warsliks Woods.

Several others played on Drinal, highest is a level 30 Ranger.
