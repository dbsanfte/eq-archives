I have a Barbarian Shaman and a Barbarian Beastlord and am finding the
Beastlord _much_ easier to solo than the Shaman. The biggest problem is
downtime with the shaman (whilst soloing), the BL actually has very little
dowtime in comparison.

Note- I have only gotten both characters to 30. If "end game playability" is
a factor at all then Shaman would be the way to go though - just eat the
downtime. Currently the general view is that end game BL's are like tit's on
a bull - utterly useless for raids and stuff.

Think of 'em as career soloist's and you aren't far off.
