Last night I bought some really nice Cured Silk hand wraps for my 7th level
monk. The price was good, but I have a question about those. Someone told me
that they were acting as a magic weapon, hence I could hit wisps with them.
It isnt written "Magic" in their description so I'm wondering... is it
really a magic weapon?

Thanks
