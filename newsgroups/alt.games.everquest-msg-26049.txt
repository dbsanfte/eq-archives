I noticed the other day that the COUNT parameter doesn't work all of the
time, but it does work MOST of the time.

Just stick COUNT (lower case) pretty much anywhere in the line, though
unless I'm doing a lot of counting (assuming they get the shift-up-arrow
fixed for /who queries) by class I usually stick it at the end.

/ all cleric count

Uh, I don't think it's possible to get a count for your present zone, IIRC.

/ all count

/ all 40 60 count works, I think.

(just the slash by itself is the same as /who...just remember to put a space
in if the person's name starts with "q"  or "ex" :) )
