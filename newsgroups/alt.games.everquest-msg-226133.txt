Doing a quick calculation, based on my memory of the rates I got when I had
ISDN, it sounds like the client is about 500 MB?  Here is what I would do in
your situation, if Sony won't tell you how to resume downloads with their
server.

I would get a web hosting account somewhere with a plan that has enough
space to hold the download and includes shell access.  I'd then use
something like wget to grab it, but it somewhere in my web space, and
download it to home.
