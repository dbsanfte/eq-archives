AAAHHH!!!!
We have to wait until Christmas 2003 to get the 3rd one? Which means we have
to wait for about June (or spring at earliest) for the last one on DVD? Why
not only 8 months apart?

By the way, the one released back in the late 70s, the animated one, does it
go all the way through part 2 or was that only half way through part 2, and
a quick "they do complete their mission" narrative at the end?

Why didn't they ever make the final part to that one? (I saw it only because
I downloaded it just before the theater release of this version).
