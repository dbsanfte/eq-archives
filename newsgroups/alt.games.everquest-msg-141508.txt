Mages are on the "HIGH demand" list on Legacy of Steel's recruitment
information page (along with Clerics), so they evidently have some use in
the high end.  (The are also looking for Paladins, Wizards, and Rogues, but
those aren't on the "HIGH" list).

See http://www.legacyofsteel.net/forums/ and click the "recruitment" topic,
if you want to see their lists and requirements.

Of course, it would be a lot of work to get that 55 Mage up to their minimum
requirements...
