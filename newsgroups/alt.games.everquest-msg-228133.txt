I mean, non-LDoN groups...  I find these groups all the time, particularly
if there are only a couple hunting in the zone... may as well group and chat
while grinding XP...  In the great divide, I routinely group with casters
who are there to get Kromif heads - they could care about the xp/loot - so
we make a nice balance - they med and protect...  I slash and whack - we're
both happy...

If I'm in the mood to group - I'll group with nearly anyone who asks...

I agree.  I do adventures for XP and loot...

I would also love to play a group where the express purpose would be too
open all chests and 'activate' all victims - just to see what happens!  G!
