Well, let me see if I can explain it better without insulting you back by 
using smaller words. Shards of Dalaya (http://www.shardsofdalaya.com) is, 
for starters, legit. There's nothing "quasi-" about it. They've already 
dealt with SoE on the issue and made the necessary adjustments.

Secondly, I would recommend SoD because it isn't polluted by mudflation 
and people pulling wagonloads of plat around with them. It is basically 
EQ with many of it's warts removed. It may not have been true a few years 
ago, but at this point I feel that SoD is the better game for a new 
player. 

Lastly, the ruleset is not completely different. It certainly differs on 
some key points, but it is still very similar to that of EQ. Naturally, 
this is my own opinion, but then again, that's what the OP requested from 
us, now isn't it? 

I feel someone interested in trying EQ would be better served with SoD. 
EQ is great for those already in the end game content, but the new player  
draw just isn't there anymore.

Wow, so they could play to level 10 only to then start paying for a much 
different (read: lesser) experience once they subscribe and begin playing 
on normal servers. Even the standard tutorial now misrepresents the vast 
majority of what the normal game is like these days.

Why you can't see why I might not recommend that route is beyond *me*.
