By the post we are talking in a group, I've rarely had a root last for
more than a second, and infact had it wear off immediately in PoN with a
group with a couple tanks with procing weapons, a mage with a procing
pet, and a wizard blasting away every time I cast it.

If you aren't in a group sure, I've had root last quite a while, some
times long enough to nuke down a creature all the way.  But if you
aren't in a group I don't know why you would want to stand around and
wait for a tank to gain agro either.

It can be your friend, it can also make things worse like any other
spell.
