Resistance is just high: Otherwise, since one of the earlier patches around
halloween, you would get an explicit message saying
"Creature soandso cannot be affected by spell soandso"

They did that - kinda scared me when I was in Rathe Mountains, during
the Halloween event, pulling a nightmare, and after my initial attempt to
snare
it said "Your target is immune to changes in the running speed"
Ugh - I really had to run at that point, as I was WAY far from
my group....

Better level up to charm the guards :)

May they kick yer ass, for nobody attempts on a DEF's life
 - and lives....


Best Regards,
