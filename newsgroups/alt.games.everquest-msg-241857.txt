A thousand monkeys banging on keyboards posted the following under the

I decided to take a look back at this group since this is the one
you've been using to prove your case the most. And the final tally is:

Top posted: 69
Bottom posted: 241

...and most of the top posts are STILL coming from TomG.

(note from while I was counting) How the fuck do you get a 60 post
flamewar in a bloody motherboard discussion group anyways....

I think the conclusive nature of the numbers speaks for itself. Nearly
three quarters of the posts are bottomposted.

I've never used the newsreader you're talking about but given its
highly dubious numbers in comparison with a visual google search, I'd
say its not measuring properly. Since I have programmed newsgroup
stats programs myself (perhaps you noticed them when you googlestalked
me), I know how easy this is to have happen.
