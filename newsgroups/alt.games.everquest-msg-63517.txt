While you can have a train in DAoC no one beisdes the aggroed party
will get attacked until the mobs return to their normal locations.  In
other words, if you train some mobs to the entrance and leave (or die)
the mobs will walk at a normal pace back to their spawn locations and
will not aggro anyone else until they get back.
