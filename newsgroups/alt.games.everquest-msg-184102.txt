You are absolutely right in the gist of your message, but I just wanted to
make one comment.

An adult cannot be hopitalized against his/her will for any reason these
days.  Even when they have been shown to be so severely mentally ill that
they are unable to care for themselves.  The only way it can be done is if
the individual is in danger of harming themselves or someone else.  (playing
too much EQ doesn't count)

Our system for handling mentally ill people is really screwed up right now.
Mentally ill people often do not realize they are ill and will refuse
treatment.  This may have been the case with this young man and his mother
may have felt completely hopeless with no way to help her son.  However, I
completely disagree with her attack on Everquest because it is obviously NOT
the problem and I'm shocked that given his history of mental illnesses that
any news agencies took her seriously at all.  It was obviously for the shock
value not because she had a legitimate complaint.
