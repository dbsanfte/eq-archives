Troll - the natural regen is nice

HP - uber alles.  ideally you'll only get hit once or twice before the
tank takes aggro back.  And if you're going it solo or with a group of
berserkers you'll kill stuff so fast it almost doesn't matter.  Right
through lvl 50 or so.

Dex - axe damage gets high at later levels.  At 53 I can throw for 70+
damage.  Crit's are nice (over 600 once, generally in the high 300's
or low 400's) so the more you hit the more likely you get em.

Snare and stun are very nice.  And as someone mentioned you don;t need
to use them all that often.

Honestly, if you've got a group of 3 berserkers all with DS potions or
a pocket DS'er, you will rock.  Hard and fast.  The DPS of a berserker
is equivalent to rogue, so imagine 3 rogues all of whom can BS.

If you're pocket DS'er is a druid then you have heals too.  Nothing
will stop you.
