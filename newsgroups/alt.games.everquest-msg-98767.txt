Hi there fellow mage

You just stay in Oasis and solo crocs.
The nice thing about crocs is, they dont draw agro from your blasting as
long as your pet is hitting it. They are not social, so they wont help each
other. Deepwater crocs goes all the way to lvl 21.
The only downside is they dont drop any good loot.
