Friends,

My secondary character is an 8th level Erudite Enchanter (Agnostic). I
have completed collecting all four of the components to get the
compendium in Freeport. I would be proud of this fact, but it was
remarkably easy. I simply started in Erudin, a brief stop in Surefall
to pick up some nitrates. Stopped off in HHKeep to pick up my next
three Animation spells. Stopped in Felwithe to pick up Enchant Silver
and Enchant Electrum. Ak'Anon to get the Regurgitonic. All this on my
own two feet - no ports. Anyways, gated back to Qeynos (that's where
I'm bound), casually strolled over to Frostbite. He was kind enough to
ralph up the fish.

Anyways, I've got the fish, the nut, the tonic, and the honeyjum. I
don't anticipate any problems getting back to Freeport to get the
compendium. Here's the problem: Can I - as an 8th level Erudite
Enchanter - go to Ogguk? Or, do I have to wait until 12th level and
have Illusion: Dark Elf?

I know I could prolly kill Lizard men and turn in toes or meat or
whatever to build faction, but are there any spells I could use? Can I
go in as a Gnome or Wood Elf and not be eaten on sight? Can I just
stroll in as my native Erudite?

Please help.
