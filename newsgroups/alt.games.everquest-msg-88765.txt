I don't quad a whole lot, its not that interesting to me, but when I do, the
north shore ulthorks in east wastes (hunters and warriors, one type goes
down in about 2 more blasts than the other though with full damage on all
hits)

Lately at 42 I've been trying to kill Bloodgill goblins in LoIO, they're
gimpy to root/rot (as in takes one bub of mana per kill) for me, I'd try to
quad them but there's never enough up (and they are kinda hard to pull
unsnared since you can't outrun them underwater without it)  but if you can
get them when no one else is eradicating them, they're easy to kill and I
would figure that with a bit of technique refinement quadding them would be
easy.

And I hate stonebrunt for precisely the reasons you mention, although it is
fun to charm a graniteback and have him guard you while you kill things (the
only charm I've done in the last 12 levels or so hadn't worn off after 10
minutes when I gated out, it was nice to have a pet, hehehe)
