FoH has got some stick on my servers boards lately from a lot of people
(they attacked Prexus #1 guild on their messageboard (furor) and even now on
the front of their website (furor again)) but id like to see somebody argue
against that.

Sure people can give their "furors a fat pos who can't see his dick or get
laid so hes always on EQ" (hes not fat and hes not ugly, there are r/l pics
of him floating about), but he is arguably the most succesful leader in EQ
history.
