    Being a raid cleric takes very little in the way of "play skills".
That's why a lot of clerics quit once they hit the raid stage - it's pretty
damn boring. Our server's top guild rarely has the actual owners of the
cleric accounts playing them on raids - usually whoever has a "gimp class"
as a main gets roped into it.

    I do NOT want to start another "Is the EULA legal?" thread, so please
don't start that tired rant again, but....

    Does the language in the EULA apply to the account, or the account
holder? Or would it be applied retroactively to the original, "true" account
holder? Reason I ask is this: when the seller sells the account, it's no
longer theirs to lose. The buyer wasn't bound by the EULA when he bought the
account, only after he first logs it in and clicks "Agree". So how can it be
banned?
