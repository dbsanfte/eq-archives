Thank you.  With the exception of 25% of levels 24 and 25 I soloed it 
all the way.  I did have a 500pp loan at the start, form a kind friend, 
to get some sensible equipment and another for a decent 1HB in my early 
teens.  This was paid back in HQ pelts though.

My friend is a l52 Bard and there may be some grouping now, although I 
seem to die when I group with him - mostly due to us trying something a 
little daft :)

Hmmm, interesting idea.  GD is usually busy, but EW generally seemed 
quiet.  Never really went after giants, but I will give them a look. 
Thank you.
