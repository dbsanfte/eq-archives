Sorry Arolpin, LGuk is a bad example for your argument.  A friend of
mine, who long ago quit playing, leveled from 30 to 40 in LGuk with
his Cleric and he was often solo, especially before he made 34.  He
was utterly untwinked, and so had gear that today would be considered
laughable.  This was over a year ago and the mobs he was killing then
are the same mobs that are there now.  Root nuking is hardly efficient,
but a Cleric can do it successfully in LGuk.

Yes, try telling the druid who sacrificed about half of his xp / hour
to duo with a guildmate instead of quadding that he solos only because
he can't get a group.  I think hughes is simply trolling, making this
shit up as he goes along.
