You're right about that. The game is about enjoying yourself with friends.
It's not nearly as much fun when you are alone and no one to chat with.

I decided to take a break a few months ago and ended up quitting. For a
while I had some good friends in the game and had a lot of fun, but when
many of them quit playing I was never able to recreate that no matter how
hard I tried. I joined several guilds, but never really gelled with any of
them.  I had a hand full of aquaintences in the game, but no real friends
and it was boring.
