Hmmm he used the whine word so now I am free to point out his whining
about me right? But wait then would I be whining about his whining
about my whining? My head hurts now...

Small fraction of melee with WB? Damn things are all over the place,
someone farmed the crap out of this weapon. Biggest boost to melee
soloing since fungi and biggest boost to "common man" dps in a long
time. But this is ok I bought 2 of these for 10k each now the price is
stable at 50k on my server so I stand to make 40-80k on the deal
depending on if I want to keep one on my War or not. Im sure you did
even better on this right?

Now thats not bad.  Takes a lot of the sting out of things. Come on
Windblade, baby bard need new Boots of Flowing Slime  :) .

Support your local Bard...buy a Windblade
