This is too funny.  Last night my wizard friend and I were trying to complete a
quest in Tenebrous Mountains and my ranger got dead.  So my friend - the 65 /
planes / raid / uber gear guy - says he'll rez me we if we come get him because
he has no idea where TM is.  So the wizard ports to POK, gets him, ports to
Grimling Forest, and we run over to TM where my corpse is waiting at the zone
in point.  We rez and the wizard asks where we want to go.  Mr. Uber says
"anywhere there's a bank".  So Mr. Wiz ports us back to Grimling since he
already had it memmed up.  Then he logs off.
As it turns out, Mr Uber had never been to GF either, or Hollowshade, and had
only been in Shar Vahl once!  He was quite impressed with the landscape in GF,
FWIW.
*I*, OTOH, was a little ticked that Mr. Wiz didn't just take the time to port
us back to POK.  I've gotten old, spoiled and lazy in my old age.  And I like
it that way, thank you very much!
