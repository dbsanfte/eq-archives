Yeah, besides beastlord is not really a melee class instead of a
caster class. They are something new. They kind of are more like a
bard since they are in a class all by themselves in a way. They are
like a new hybrid/caster pet type class. In fact they are the only
member of that type of character. Due to the pet, melee is not such a
huge concern while mana pool to heal the pet/buff etc, is. This makes
them totally unlike every other hybrid and more like a class like the
magician.

From what is said here it really seems like preference to me
and most of the things people have mentioned, outside of mana pool,
are not going to matter much when your pet is the tank much of the
time. Personally iksar and troll seem pretty good to me for the regen,
while vah shir is nice for the look/safefall/factions/sneak. I made an
ogre one to try it out and it was pretty dang good for the starting
stamina/str/not getting stunned from the front (though the last one is
moot if pet is tanking.. but nice if you get hit while trying to cast,
which is going to happen sometime)

The troll or iksar also get points for the most unique pets. I've seen
tons of beastlord vah shirs with their tigers but very few iksar or
troll ones with their scaled wolfs/alligators. The iksars lil scaled
wolf-stegosaurus looking thing is especially fun.

Really its preference though. This is probably one of the only classes
where the bonuses for this race or that one are really not going to
make play that different. Any of the races you'd pick has one larger
advantage while not having any real disadvantages beyond troll and
iksar getting 20 percent less xp when their regen is not such a big
deal anymore. Equipment might also sway your preference since the
medium, including barbarian, races can wear the hero bracer while I
don't think large can. Large races can probably wear some items which
the other ones can't also. Barbarian can wear both, since it is
large/medium at the same time. Barbarian also has the disadvantage of
being the beastlord with the worst vision at night.
