Newbie

When I was your age there -was- no breeze, we had to get from 1 to 29 without a
single taste of caffeine, I remember when Kunark came out I was on my third
character camping in Oasis and eagerly awaiting the rafts in from Timorous Deep
with the few who had the expansion bringing in fresh copies of the spell to auction
off.

My first mage wore Raw Silk armor he'd made himself all the way up to when I
stopped playing him at level 28.

Splendid, 5 mage, Firiona Vie
