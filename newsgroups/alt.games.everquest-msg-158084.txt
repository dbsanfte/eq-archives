Except that anyone in my group who tried to charge me for a rez would
wind up on my ignore-and-never-to-hunt-with-again list quicker than
you can say "Porting to all druid locations". If I had no cleric in my
group, I would welcome the accessibility of rezzes. The only ones who
would lose out are the cleric's looking to make cash for rezzes.

You're pretty much supporting all the arguments against your own.

Nope. The cash cow feature had been reduced drastically. They would
still be the more convenient and often necessary means of a rez.

Nope. I would tell them the same thing we've told you. You have only
lost *some* of your ability to make quick cash.

Yes, I would.

Yes, I would.

Again, yes, I would.

Again...

You're not supposed to be the best at anything, because your are very
good at a *lot* of things.

Whereas, I *would* make all (if not, most) of the above points to a
cleric finding themself facing a similar scenario, I wouldn't view the
addition of rez vendors in the same light. Clerics, by their very
nature, should be able to do two things: heal and resurrect.
Trivializing either of these (as was done with the baby CH given to
the druid and shaman) is a bad idea in my opinion.

From a pure role-plaing perspective, porting is not necessarily a
druidic ability. That would typically be an ability possessed by
wizards. I don't see it as class-defining for a druid. Therefore, when
that ability is infringed upon where the druid class is concerned, I
can't really get too worked up about it, and I do play a 36 druid.

Druids can do so much so well that you will find little sympathy
around here when one of their perks takes a hit. Try crying on the
shoulder of a rogue or warrior about your inability to port people
around for money (again, you can still do it for free to your heart's
content). Let them give you a little perspective on what hardship
really is.
