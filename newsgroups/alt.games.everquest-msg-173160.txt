The freedoms Americans enjoy as well as *ALL* of Western Europe were
paid for with the blood of American men and women. Your scorn for
those that serve (or have served) is completely without merit, and
only shows you to be nothing more than a jaded selfish and spoiled
little child. I am begining to think the world would be a better place
if the US had let the Euros kill themselves off in the last 2 World
Wars.

Pure ignorance, and not worthy of rebuttal.

Say that in Iraq (about Iraq) and you will be beaten tortured and
killed. 

The ONLY reason there has not been a WWIII is because the US has been
the most powerful nation since WWII. The US has almost singlehandedly
acted as the sole stabilizing force in the world for the last 60
years. This fact cannot be denied, and you are more the fool for
thinking otherwise

>Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11.

>Get a brain.

I have a brain (unlike you). I can also read. There is plenty of
evidence to support the link between 9/11 and Iraq. You only have to
open your eyes to see it. Further 9/11 is only a symptom of a
worldwide disease (terrorism). Beyond that there is ample reason
beyond 9/11 to liberate Iraq from the terror regime of SH.

-------(Pasted from another newsgroup)-----------
...And here is a great commentary on disinformation being carried out
by the Press or by fellows inside the Government who oppose linkage.
These stories revolve around the Meeting in Prague between Atta and
Iraqis Secret Service.

>Well...you havent managed to get him out yet...whats holding you up?

A spineless, gutless, ineffectual UN funded and supported mainly by
the US with economic conflicts of interest with Iraq (French and
Russian Oil contracts, etc). The only thing holding the US back is a
fundamental desire to be the "good guys", and not act unilaterally.

No we bombed the fuck out of his army, and only stopped when the goals
set by the UN were met. The same gutless UN that refused to "mandate"
his removal then is trying to block the US from removing him now. How
soon you seem to have forgotten the atrocities and killing committed
by his army when it invaded Kuwait.

The "sanctions" would have been lifted years ago if SH had abided by
the terms of the cease-fire. Innocent Iraqis have died, not because of
UN imposed sanctions, but because their "leader" refuses to meet the
obligations he agreed to and continually ignores the terms of the
cease-fire.

Every member nation of the UN that refused to allow the removal of SH
back in '91 is guilty of leaving SH in power. The US is only guilty of
abiding by the UN mandate. A mistake that will soon be corrected. 

>Before that you were GIVING him presents of military equipment!!!

Victory in 2 world wars.
The liberation or Western Europe (TWICE!)
The rebuilding of Western Europe and Japan post WWII
The prevention of Soviet Aggression durring the Cold War

The US may not be "saviours of the world", but we are the closest any
nation has come. The only thing "mealy-mouthed" is the anti-US
sentiment expressed by ungrateful malcontents that should have been
left wallowing in the rubble they created for themselves.
