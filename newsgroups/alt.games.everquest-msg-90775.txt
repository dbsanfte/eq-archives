wow...i think with your attitude, you should move to the us and work
for the postal system...then, you will have the best of both worlds...
have verant's sorry local support and a job that fits your
temperment....
i agree 100% with your take on verant's sorry support but your
misspelling of "your" vice "you're" is a bit annoying.  i know verant
also has a lame email tech support as well...anyway,
enjoy the sunshine of the lovely uk and stay away from the 
gun clubs...
