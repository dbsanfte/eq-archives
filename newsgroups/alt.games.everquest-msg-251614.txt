No snare, no root (to speak of), no stun, no slow.  Air pet casts stun, 
but when he likes, not in response to anything.  Earth pet casts root, 
same deal.  Fire pet (post 50) does have a snare, but he also has half a 
dozen other spells he likes to cast and is very stupid about it, odds of 
him getting a useful snare on the target when you want it aren't good, 
and he's as likely to dispell it after as to do anything useful.  I'm 
not certain the 63 fire pet even does this, I haven't got the spell yet 
(and am not too eager to get it, fire has been my least favorite type 
since passing 50)

In my experience it takes longer to find and organize a port than it 
does to run... but its been quite a while since my cleric was going to 
the Grey regularly, perhaps its not so difficult anymore.

Just as a benchmark, I did an LDoN yesterday, and got 15% of level 63 in 
an hour and a half, with a decidedly sub-par group (spent a lot of time 
waiting on people to recover from rez, if you see what I mean); since I 
got 1% in an hour in Fungusgrove, thats about 1/10th what a full group 
in LDoN gets.  I'm not knocking this spot, since its just the sort of 
thing I was asking for, just trying to get a handle on how relative 
rewards for solo vs group play are working these days.

Course a mage isn't that good a solo class, we're Much better with 
almost any partner.  And of course I think I can up that kill rate in 
Fungusgrove with some experience, maybe as much as double.  What I won't 
be able to do is overcome the massive grouping bonus they get now for a 
full group, nor the fact that I'm trying to do without slow or snare, 
which are pretty much the two vital soloing tools (slow makes melee work 
lots better, snare makes kiting work much better)
