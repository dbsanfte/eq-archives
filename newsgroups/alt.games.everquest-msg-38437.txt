Since this thread deals with weird zoning glitches, I'll throw in one
from last night. As I understand it, this isn't all that uncommon. We
were fighting in City of Mist, and in the middle of a battle, somebody
pulled a Train from Hell (TM) out of the temple and ran through our
group on the bridge. Our cleric gave the evac call, and everyone ran for
the zone. In typical tank fashion, I stayed there trying to attract
attention until the casters had a head start for the zone line, then
started hoofing it there myself. Got stunned numerous times on the way,
with about seven undead beating on me. Two thousand plus hit points
suddenly seemed like not vey many to have. ;-p
  I made it to the zone line at a crawl with a sliver of life left. When
I finished zoning, I had less than fifty hit points, but rather than
being in the hall outside the zone, I was in the far corner of EJ, up on
top of the ledge south of the FoB zone. (I suppose somebody at VI
thought this was a "safe" place. Like there's any safe places in EJ.) 
But here's the really odd part. All my buffs were still in place. I had
about six on me, and still had them all. From what I'd read, I thought
that little process was supposed to strip all your buffs off?
