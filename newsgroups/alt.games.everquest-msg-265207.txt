One note, the pre kunark people are mostly gone, if not all. The Vision, 
as it were, has no place here anymore. Or most other places.

Uber gear is a state of mind. It's something with +1 more than what the 
other guy has. Or +2, because some other people have a +1. In a game 
like EQ, if the +1 isn't their, there is little incentive for half the 
player base to bother playing. He who quits 'NYCHMS' with the best toys 
'wins', and that's the only way to 'win'. Most players are goal 
oriented. I want a better sword. Now I want a magic sword. Now I want a 
magic sword that sparkles and has a proc. Now I want a magic sword that 
I have to go on an obscenely long quest for, called an epic, to get, 
because only 15 other people have it. Now I want a new magic sword, 
because the epic suxxors. etc..
Essentially, weapons are the shiny. Many people need the shiny in order 
to be motivated to play.

Part of the problem SWG has with keeping people, among other things, is 
there is no shiny. Jedi is kinda a shiny, but it is a tough grueling 
shiny. But weapons? I can buy second best for 10000 cred, about 5 hours 
after I start playing. Best is 20mil, but that's because Bounty hunters 
are rich and dumb.
Armor, same deal. Second best is 10k, best is outta most players league. 
You don't use the best anyway, as using it wears it out. I knew a bounty 
hunter with what had to be the best set of weapons and armor on the 
server. They stayed in his house, because he didn't want to 'waste 
them'. Was 135 million worth of gear.

> EQ1.
Everything I've seen is geared towards smaller level content; group type 
stuff, and better solo content. They have to, however, cater to the 
raider at least somewhat, because without the raider, EQ would not be 
here at the same level... it would be limping along with 100k 
subscribers, or less. Your casual/small group player is an important 
person to attract, but I would hazard a guess that the majority of the 
'non churn' multi year players are the FoH 'W3 4r3 Ub3r' types that play 
to be the best, to be better than you. And me. And the other 99.999%. 
That will raid 6 hours for a chance to roll on a piece of gear that 
gives their 10k hp warrior +10 more hp.
That being said, from what I've read WoW will cater much more to the 
Uber Raider than EQ.

While I agree in principle that 100% resists are a bad thing, resists in 
general are not. The flip should also be true; 100% resists on mobs are 
a bad thing.

Player houseing (as I understand it) isn't scattered across the world; 
rather it is stuck in the cities (where it belongs) with instanced 
apartments + a 'high rent' player housing area. It's most like Final 
Fantasy's mog houses in that respect (except you can let others in your 
place... FF mog house is for you only).
