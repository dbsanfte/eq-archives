Pets always stop chasing a mob and begin meleeing as soon as they get
in melee range, making them essentialy engage at near max melee range.
(Not quite max melee range, there is a buffer they violate to prevent
constantly having to chase the mob after each melee round)  However
they will not move another inch as long as they remain in melee range.
In other words, they start at max range but they do not adjust their
distance to keep from getting too close.  PCs, on the other hand, dance
around.  They move closer and farther away, so pets will inevitably end
up closer to mobs than PC's from time to time.

No need for all that, just have a pet and a tank engage.  As long as
the tank is doing more push, the mob will get closer and closer to the
pet, even to the point where the mob is right on top of the pet.
