Since my BL is a troll I have the same xp deficit that iksars have I can
comment on this.  The xp penalty definitely hurts at later levels, but the
regen when soloing can definitely help to compensate.  I didn't even really
notice the bad xp till the late 40's but before then being able to kill
non-stop it didn't matter that I only got 1% a kill when I was killing tons
of mobs in an hour.  The regen can decrease downtime a good bit (or at least
enough that it helps out IMO) when soloing.  Of course in groups where
downtime isn't based on how many HP you are currently at the offset of bad
xp can definitely hurt.

As for an Iksar Necro, I'm wishing now that my necro was Iksar rather than
Dark Elf cause that regen is a beautiful thing with Allure lines.

And besides if the OP is just making a character to have fun with when
unable to find a group, then the journey doesn't necessarily need to be
fast, just fun.  And there isn't much more fun than being evil.  :)
