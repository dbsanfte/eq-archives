Example: I target unclaimed mob, cast Frostbolt 2 (which is my nuke with 
6 second snare, 2 or so second casting time, plus it doesn't do damage 
till the 'bolt' travels to the target, and the bolt is slow. call it 5-7 
seconds from button to hit).

Another dude who is not in my field of view (he has more range, or 
behind terrain) shoots it with a blunderbuss. This is almost 
instantaneous. He does 5 points.

My bolt is on the way, I can't stop it, it hits, 43 damage and a snare.

guess who mr. mob is pissed at the most.

If the player is a Good Guy (TM) he will smash it hard to bring agro 
back to him. If not, like has happened to me more than once, he will sit 
down to rest while I deal with it.

Which is why I started (then stopped because I was being a bastard I 
felt) pulling with my insta nuke when I got it.
