It seems like tailoring skills are going to become less sophisticated
in Velious, judging by the fact that my wood elf's leggings will be
barely attached to the waistband, as opposed to actually being
pants... also, her hips look kinda anorexic, like the bones inside are
too large for the body (contributes to the bulge thing, but dark elves
still are worse at that... human girl has it too), the large-hands-
syndrome is present, and I still don't quite like the head shape.

On the bright side, I like the green embroidery and trimmings.

Oh, and they hit jackpot with the iksar :) Female halfling was cute
too, even if they took away her skirt.

Generally speaking, the Ogre still looks incredibly lame (old ogre
might be dumb, but he has personality. New ogre looks like a giant
baby Fudd), all the males seem to have been fed steroids - way too
much of the cartoon superhero broad shoulder build, even on frail
races like elves...
