My Baking skills on my main Enchanter is at 152.
I got it up by doing bear/wolf/mammoth/lion fillet in cream .
god was that ever hard work. had to run around to get wolf parts ( don't
anyone loot wolf parts?) none on venders had to hunt some down, then to
Thurgdun for lion/bear parts and go hunt down a few mammoths. then I had to
get my Smithing high enough to make a fillet knife & dairy spoon.
Now I wanted to do a simple recipe next , was going to try Gnoll chops till
191.
 So went to Black Burrow and Split Paw. lots of gnolls there
Nothing, not a single part . has anyone ever seen gnoll parts in EQ.
