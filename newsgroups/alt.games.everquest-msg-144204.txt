Evidently you box it up, call it Everquest and nearly 500,000 month
to month subscribers play it for three and half years plus. They had
no trouble at all!

This game has NEVER been anything but tedious most of the time, its
ENTIRE design is based upon withholding. Its kind of pointless to have
it that way to this degree though; I could see it if it was an hourly
charge (oh my god would lives have been ruined then ;)  )
