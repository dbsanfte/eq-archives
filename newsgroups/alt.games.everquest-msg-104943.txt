Wow, haven't had to use a tape deck since my Atari home computer.  Used to
hate to forget to reset the tape counter before searching for a file.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
