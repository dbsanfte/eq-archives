>>>SNIP<<<
>> 2. This bombing goes way above and beyond 'regular' terrorism. <<

I may be being overly sensitive and nit-picky, but quoting misinformation
has always been a pet peeve of mine.

People, please, there was NO bomb. It was three jets crashing into three
separate buildings.

Now, before you reply stating "but there were explosions". Yes, they were.
Jet fuel tends to explode when the fuel tank is ruptured.

Also, I know there was a fourth plane. But since it did not hit a building,
it didn't pertain to the stated reply.
