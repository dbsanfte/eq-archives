Lol, indeed!  On the one hand, it's a classic symptom of getting "too
immersed" in a game for you to draw such a sweeping real life comparison.
It's a *game*, and his character didn't *earn* the tunic.  You can tell by
the way he plays the game (crossing Antonica on foot rather than begging for
a port or an escort) that he likes his character to *earn* what he
accomplishes in the game.  This is simply a function of how he, as an
author, wants to write the story of his character's adventures.

On the other hand, while I agree with your point that in *real life* people
value things they've worked for much more than handouts, you damage your own
point by your "faux amazement" that this is the case.  It's human nature,
and this phenomenon has been around at least as long as there has been a
written history.
