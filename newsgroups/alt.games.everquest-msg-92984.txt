But don't totally neglect AC/HP, you're a healer, you WILL get agro, no
matter how hard you try not to.

Testament is an EXCEPTIONAL item for the level that you can get it at (you
might want to wait until 19 for new nuke though), I still use mine sometimes
for soloing "easy dont need resists don't get hit" stuff, but for general
use I prefer Sarnak Battle Shield  (plus it looks cooler  =P)
