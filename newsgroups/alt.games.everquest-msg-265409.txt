I'll be giving WoW a try as soon as my beta key is emailed to me.

I think EQ2 will be the way to go, though - plently of time for them
to fix things - it's possible that the poisons thing is bugged, and
will be fixed.

I had assumed that by adding poison to weapons, you'd get a permanent
bonus - otherwise it seems odd that Rogues get a damage redution, in
return for a temp bonus to damage - and one that keeps cosing money,
too.

If this stays the same into retail, I may go with a mage or warrior,
as they seem better candidates for soloing.

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
