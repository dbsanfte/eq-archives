Two things.  First, go to eq.castersrealm.com, go to the section for your
class, and look up the skill.  If it says it has to be trained, make sure
you put at least one training point in.

Second, you have to fall to get a chance at a skill increase.  Switch to one
of the third person views and watch the animiation as you run down the
slope.  If it stays with the running animation, rather than the falling
animation, you won't have a shot at a skill increase.
