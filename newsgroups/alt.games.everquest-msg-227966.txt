I loved this about Horizons:

"Horizons is a sad story. David Allen, the original creator of Horizons, had
a much more substantial game planned. When his Beta FAQ hit the net there
was a strong community that swarmed to the concept of that game. Sadly, due
to corporate bullshit, David Allen left his own game and development was up
to Artifact Entertainment. They took over and it turned into the steamy pile
that we know today as, "Horizons: treadmills and stuff.""

David Allen left because he was a froot loop who had no idea of what was and
was not technologically feasible, and had a penchant for running his mouth
off promising all sorts of unrealistic things to the drooling credulous
fanboys (and this writer of this article appears to be one) who ate all that
shit up without thinking.  Then his company ran out of money with very
little to show for it and had to be bailed out by all that "corporate
bullshit".

The guy might as well have talked up the virtues of Dawn, and maybe he did
later, as I stopped reading this badly supported article on page 2.
