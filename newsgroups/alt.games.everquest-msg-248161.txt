Give the entrance to the Hole a try. Hardly ever anyone there, and a nice XP
modifier. Mobs are warrior, rogue and paladin, around 37-40, going light
blue at 52-53. Handy zone line for popping out and refreshing SoW, (and
escaping overpulls :-) although you'll not want to do that as a pet class.
As a monk, FD/Phantom splitting was extremely easy, and would be clear the
entrance just as the first mobs start to repop. Without splittnig, you'll
need to handle 2 at a time, but once cleared will be singles all the way.
You get the odd roamer, but pullling way back to next to zone in by the edge
of the pool keeps out of thier way.

They drop loam encrusted gear, which is ok for twinking baby casters, and
reasonable gems, which sell for up to 45p. Usually make 150-200pp an hour
there.

You'll need to buy a key in Paineel, which itself needs a key. For this,
you'll need some faction work in the Warrens. Slaughtering every Kobold in
sight, (collecting the molars) I went from scowling to indifferent in about
90 minutes. That was when my iksar monk was 51, you'll probably do it
quicker, as the warder will stick to the runners. This is enough to talk to
the skelly guards in the newbie garden (say "I need a key"). Once in, hand
the molars (about 20) to Royal Guard Lilkus, which will get you from indiff
to aimiable.

Rallia Hapera sells the Hole key (looks like a bag), cost me 117pp with CHA
at 135.
