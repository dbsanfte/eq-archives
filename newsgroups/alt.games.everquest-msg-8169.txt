You were not waiting patiently for a quest item that drops once in a blue
moon. You were farming. Farming by itself it not *automatically* despicable.
Hogging a farm for over an hour when there are others who would also like a
chance to kill the NPC *is* despicable. Did you offer to share? It doesn't
sound like it. Why not?

OK, so you got killed, lost your farm, and when you got back the people who
had been waiting 20+ minutes were there. They make a surpassingly
considerate gesture, and cede the farm back to you.

Later, you go line dead, leaving the farm for a *second* time. This time,
you don't get the farm back. And you want to know if the people who were so
considerate to you violated the "gentelmanly rules?" You, sir, need a lesson
in manners.

Lesson 1: If you are farming, do not hog it.

Lesson 2: If you go leave the farm unattended (for whatever reason), and
someone gives it back to you, they are doing you a *favor*. Say "thank you".
Perhaps even offer to share (look that word up if it is unfamiliar to you).

Lesson 3: If you have been farming an NPC for a while and you leave it (for
whatever reason), and someone else steps in, accept it gracefully and hunt
somewhere else.

(I almost didn't send this. It's not as though I am a paragon of virtue. But
this fellow's attitude strikes at the core of what I think is wrong with the
behavior of too many people playing EverQuest.)
