Well, according to VI and some logs the guardian was aggroed for 15 minutes
straight and never capable of getting to the target. Not sure what they
could have done in that time, but it sure as hell indicates a pathing bag or
safe spot.

But even setting the whole exploit or not issue aside, VI still overreacted
by banning players and destroying the guild without giving a warning first.
That alone puts VI in a desrespectfull position, and that's what CQ is
trying to get as an official statement at the moment (if I may read between
the lines of Itzlegends' emails).


Kilmir, who's glad he's only experienced positive re-/actions of GM's and VI
since his start at christmas 2000.
