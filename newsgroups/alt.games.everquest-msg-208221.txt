I agree that guild is different from pickup group.  Still, as I said 
above, my experience has been generally good, even in pickup groups, with 
NBG.  Of course, I don't play a melee only class at high levels, but, I 
was never the one to insist on NBG, and, it seemed to work fine outside 
of PoP zones as well.
