At early levels you don't need more than two maxed (and you do have
enough skill points to keep them maxed, you only need to put them in
in the very early going).

They all go up through use. At least put points in when they will
actually help. The difference between how often you hit with 5 skill
points in at L2 and with 0 is phenominal; by putting skill points in
my weapon choice I can kill things that a identical equipped player
has to run from.

What is truly silly is what you are suggesting - putting skill points
in a skill you aren't actually using. You can work on that later.
Everyone constantly overstates how hard it is to raise skill later -
it is EASY, right from zero skill, once you have significant Offense
skill.

That's not what I am talking about. If you're hanging close to the max
anyways, don't bother putting any in. I am talking the very early
going when you have virtually nothing and its a struggle (untwinked)
to kill things that give good experience. Don't fuck yourself over a
second time by hording skill points for that mythical day you'll dump
them somewhere.

My ranger has never used a skill point that wasn't for unlocking a
skill. Ever. I have no idea how much I have horded away. Skill points
are good for one thing later on - getting a small jump on tradeskills.
That's it. Might as well use most of them when they matter.

That may be what you were saying, or what he meant, but that's not
what the person I replied to said.
