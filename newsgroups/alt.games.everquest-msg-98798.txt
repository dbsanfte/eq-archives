What probably occurred: the second group you were with were experienced 
players on alts, and/or twinked.  In other words, the loot off of the orcs 
probably seemed trivial to them and they saw your complaints as petty when 
they were just trying to clear corpses and tidy up.  

It could have been that it was a free for all loot group.  When I did PUGs 
at lower levels that was fine with me, I cared more about experience than 
anything else.  Friendly Free for All looting means try not to take more 
than your fair share, but the group isn't keeping track of who looted 
what.  On regular loot this was always my preferred method in pick up 
groups.  In non-PUGs it was and is usually master loot (one person loots 
all, splits coin and gems as he goes).

In any case, when joining a group, just ask what the loot rules are.  Not 
everyone does everything the same way.  And try to work within the loot 
rules of the group... don't go run off screaming because they are doing 
FFA looting, just try to get one out of every sixth mob.
