My friend leveled up her skill from 150 to 185 on solstice robes.  Yes, her
failure rate was very high, roughly one success in twenty.  However, the cost to
fail is around 10pp not counting spider silks, which we farmed with alts which
were making experience doing so.

IF you are selling silks for 100pp each, or heck, buying them at that rate, then
you are sort of spending 610 (or is it 1210?) pp per fail, or 24200+300 for the
gem thingie per success, and losing massive amounts on the deal.

However, we looked at it as 200+300= 500pp per success, which sell easily for
2500pp each... we made a very nice profit on this back when solstice earrings
were the hottest commodity on the planet.  Funny thing is, she was always hoping
to fail, since she was really looking for skill ups, and there was no cheaper
skill up project in the game than failing solstice robes!  Success would mean
needing another gem encrusted thingie, which meant some actual effort and
hooking up with our enchanter friend.

I can't say I know every detail of this, so I could be off by a decimal place
here or there.  In no way, however, did her 30 points of tailoring skill earned
this way cost hundreds of thousands of plat, in fact even if we'd destroyed the
robes (like budding smiths tend to do with banded armor, which isn't worth
carrying to the vendor to sell) we'd still be out less than 20Kpp total.
