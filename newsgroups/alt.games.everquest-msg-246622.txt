A rating of x means your songs will be x/10 times more effective,
e.g. a song that does 10 damage normally would do 22 damage with a 22
modifier.  Normally that would be called a 2.2 modifier, why they
display a number ten times higher I don't know[1], but that's how it
works.

[1] I realise the reason is probably that the game uses the number 22
for calculations, but that doesn't mean they have to display it like
that.

I have no idea what you guildy was talking about, but everyone wants
HP, most everyone wants AC, bards supposedly fizzle less with higher
dex (the effect of high dex is fairly small though), so that's why
those are desirable.  You also want mana and int for your mana pool,
though that matters little until you get to level 63 and get fading
memories, and charisma is important to make lull resists less
dangerous.  And of course instrument modifiers are all-important - you
really, really want to get the epic, if you can.

As for suggestions, well, learn to twist songs, and always be aware of
what's going on so you can play the right songs (particularly
important if you're doing crowd control).  That's about all there is
to it. ;-)
