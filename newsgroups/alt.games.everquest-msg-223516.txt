Not aware of any sources, but here's a very short overview.

Most important thing - graveyards.  When you die in one of the planes, 
after 10 minutes (someone correct me if that's wrong), your corpse 
relocates to the graveyard, which is most often right next to where you 
zone in.  So, don't be afraid to explore due to hard corpse recovery - 
no such thing in the planes.

Planes are broken into different tiers.  Tier One planes are Innovation, 
Nightmare, Justice and Disease, and are open to all characters 46th or 
higher.

Justice is by far the easiest (in terms of which mobs you can camp at 
first), with Nightmare, Disease and Innovation being an order of 
magnitude harder.

The entrance to Innovation usually has a couple of groups camping it, 
and so sometimes the zone-in is a bit risky.

The entrance to Nightmare is sometimes being trained, and the graveyard 
isn't always a safe place to be.

The entrance to Disease is usually pretty safe.

The entrance to Justice is virtually always safe.

The method of leaving is plane is different - in Innovation it's the 
little column-box on the right side of the graveyard (click it to zone), 
in Nightmare it's a stone inside the building next to the graveyard, in 
Disease you need to move back a cover on the right hand side of the 
graveyard and drop inside, and in PoJ it's a run into the zone, 
downstairs, left, right, upstairs, left, left, right, and click on the 
door ;)

Tier 2 planes have restricted access.  Sometimes being a particular 
level is enough (such as 55 to get into Plane of Valor), othertimes you 
need to get flagged or keyed, which usually involves either killing raid 
mobs, performing trials in groups, or doing quests, all of which are 
outside the scope of this short write-up.

I think of the Tier 3 planes as the elemental planes (fire, earth, 
water, air), which I've no hope of ever getting to and so don't know 
much about.

Finally, the last one, is the Plane of Time, home to the strongest gods 
and guilds.
