Go to the camp spots.  Ask in /say if they have
an open spot, or mind you praciticing H2H, 1HS,
1HB, etc on their mobs until you get a spot.
Most groups will say yes, and most of the time
in a PUG it seems like somebody comes and
goes every half hour or so.

It's also good for getting you to meet new
people, especially if during your practice
sessions you keep the others laughing
or something.
