 Personally I like the key quest for HS. It keeps the population down to
a fairly tolerable level. Not many people seem to bother with it since
"Sebilis key is easier". Limits it to people who actually want to be
there.

 When you say CS in your first sentence, do you really mean SS? And you
sorta do need a SS key if you want to get your CS key. Unless you happen
to be grouped with someone who has a SS key and they don't mind running
you over.
