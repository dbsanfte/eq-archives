Mesmerisation is more of a stun line of spells. Some things ARE immune
to stun and to mez. (giants cannot be mez'd and give this message to
remind you that you left your brains at home! hehe) Maybe the MOB
you tried to mesmerize is immune to it. Mesmerisation isn't the best
spell in the game for enchanters, but if you have a good puller, lots
of open space to target mobs, and a group that doesn't smack your
mesmerized mobs, it can really help with multiple pulls. Sarnak Fort
in ill omen is a good place to practice, as is Crushbone and Black-
burrow. (at least parts of blackburrow are good)
