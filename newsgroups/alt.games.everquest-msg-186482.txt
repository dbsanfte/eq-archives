As a wargamer (see other subthread) it can be done.  But you have to be
willing to accept much smaller profits.

You've just hit the nail on the head.  It's about the cash ... not just
profits, but huge profits.  It's not about my gaming style .. Ben's gaming
style .. or your gaming style.  It's about the quarterly report.

No no no ... not all games.  I didn't say a thing about all games.  But even
if you choose to go after a niche market, you need to listent to the folks
who will be playing the games to see what they like and what they don't ...
what whould make the game better for the folks you hope to be your players.

It just struck me the difference is this:  In the wargame market, the type
of user interaction/changes that are made would usually appear in the next
game in the series.  If a group of players doesn't like the changes, they
can still play the older game.

But in EQ, there is no 'next game in the series' ... the game is constant.
The folks who like it the old way are out of luck.
