Get an enchanter in the group ASAP.

Ahh, I see you do have a chanter. Good druid. The bad news: Make sure the
tanks know to /taunt at least twice before breaking mez. Otherwise a mob
that's been mezzed awhile during the fight will -immediately- agro on the
healer when the tanks break mez.

Root all the mobs before healing. A good group will all be beating on the
same mob so the root's should last a bit. Make sure the tanks have worked
up a good amount of hate, and heal only when the tank drops to 2.5 bars HP
or lower. If you don't heal at that point it's sometimes too late. If you
heal earlier than that it's a waste of mana.

Does the advice of the primary chanter count? My job is always to keep the
healers alive. If you go down, I go down type-a-thing. If you -do- have a
chanter, make sure they are on the stick - if you get agro'd it's the
=chanters= job to get it off you by mezzing it. Not the tanks job to
poke it with little pieces of metal in the vain hope it will turn on them
instead of rip you a new one.
