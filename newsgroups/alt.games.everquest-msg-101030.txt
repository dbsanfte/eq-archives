bluebie duels never yeild loot, to loot coin you need a real pvp kill on
TZ/VZ/SZ
and to get a loot/coin kill you need to get a real pvp kill on RZ.

LAG is the easy one :)

regardless of how close you two are, your packets are going from your house
to san diego and then to your friends house, and his also bounce through
san diego (where the EQ servers live) and then to you.

lag, when he made the hit, you might have appeared to him as being in range,
and when the server validated the attack, it also saw you as in range.
