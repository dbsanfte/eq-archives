Ignoring the top posting idiocy, were you dropped on your head as a baby
or something? Please tell us how a quest, where you have to collect a
set of no drop items, combine them in a no drop container resulting in a
no-drop turn-in item, could be multiquested? I'm sure we're all just
dying to know.

Back to the original question, no. The SoTF quest isn't a container
quest, and all four items are no drop, but one can easily be obtained by
second hand looting for the MQ.
