heh, forgot about the chessboard, fun memories of the first time I killed
one of the pawns. That's a good place to go.  Crushbone is good too.  Don't
worry about Luclin till 15 or so.  Paludal caverns is the place to go then.
Should get you into the 20s fast there.  After that, Netherbian Lair or
Marus Seru until 30.  At 29 or 30, Dawnshroud Peaks.

Other places to go on Antonica at 10.  EC, Sro, Befallen, Misty thicket has
new mobs you may want to check out, many many places.

Good luck
