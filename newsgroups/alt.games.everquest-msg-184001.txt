I don't know why people nowadays might have it in for Gnomes
(Gnomes are for punting!).  But back in the deep dark days of
forgotten history, just a few months after initial release,
somebody put up a "player guide" somewhere on the web that
claimed that Necros were the "best" class and that Gnomes made
the "best" Necros (Gnomes are for punting!).  What followed was
a plague of Gnome Necros that covered Norrath (Gnomes are for
punting!), to the point that I saw more Necros than Druids for
a period of months leading up to the DoT nerf (can't recall
exactly when that occured), after which many Necros mysteriously
disappeared and we were left with mostly just dr00ds to bash.
