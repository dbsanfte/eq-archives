Let's say you're a Shadow Knight ( a Dark Elf, for sake of argument, so that
you don't have to worry about being killed in the Outpost right away), in
the mid-to-high teens range. You just got off the boat from the Oasis, got
yourself a bind from a helpful Enchanter, and your sword is itching to slice
into some surface meat.

Where do you go? What do you kill? Where are good places (within a zone or
two from Overthere) to solo? To team up and hunt in a pack?

What do you think?
