Most I have talked to think SWG sucks.  Many have come back to EQ after 
leaving to play SWG.

How noobs are treated will vary, but, usually not too bad.

Gameplay can be mindless and tedious, in the end, it's what you make of 
it.

Never played any of those, so can't comment.

For the best chance at roleplay, you will want to use the Firiona Vie 
server, and even there, don't expect a majority of people to be 
roleplaying from what I am told.  On other servers, you might, once in a 
long while, encounter some roleplaying.
