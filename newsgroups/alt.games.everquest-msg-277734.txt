You're preaching to the choir regarding the merits of *not* buying plat 
and twinking out of the gate.

However, the fact remains that a new player does feel at a notable 
disadvantage playing this game as it comes out of the box after they see 
the advantages the "average" player enjoys.

For a change of scenery, I started a brand new player on a different 
server a while back. It was fun for a while, until I realized that the 
people I met and grouped with would and did easily outpace me. I didn't 
care that it took me longer to kill a particular mob than others, or 
that I didn't have enough coin to even keep me in bandages much of the 
time. What I did care about was the fact that I wasn't able to group 
with the same people more than a couple of times before they became too 
high of level for that to be reasonable. Nor did I care for being a mana 
sponge, comparatively speaking, as a relatively far under-equipped tank, 
or constantly running OOM as a healer with a tiny mana pool. Someone 
else was always the better option for tank or healer or just about 
anything else. As such, I didn't play on that server for long.

So, back to my original point, SoE appears to be accellerating that 
effect with EQ2.
