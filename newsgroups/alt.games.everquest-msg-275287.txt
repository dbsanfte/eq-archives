Ok, I have spent two days now, harvesting, gathering, mining, meeting reds,
doing shard runs, and finding out where I dont want to be at level 16....
.....and, I not only havent I found an electrum cluster...I can only
barely find rocks to mine.
Mining skill....35.
Looking everywhere but the right place....
I dont mind working for it, dont get me wrong, but, phhht...this is
not fun anymore.
Tips?
