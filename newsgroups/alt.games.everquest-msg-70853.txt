Completely irrelevant tangent.  Thanks for the Mr. Obvious impersonation
though.

Let's test that theory.  Inner fire, 20 heal, 5 or 6 seconds per cast with
the refresh time?  (close enough).

Fungi, 15 point heal every 7 seconds, no mana cost.

Well, you were right on one part, while I'm standing there chain-casting
inner fire, I'm healing faster than fungi.  Except when I'm all done healing
with fungi *I'm Ready To Fight Again*.

Thanks again for pointing out that this is a downtime reducer.  I'm not
quite sure who you're trying to disagree with, as nobody has claimed it's
not a downtime reducer.
