I have a HUGE problem with this statement from the mother.

The kid has was having seizures.  Everquest, and other 3D games, posed
a legitimate, physical danger to this boy.

Whose responsibility is it to make sure that this kid avoids the
things that might cause him to go into seizures?  Did I hear someone
say "His parents"?  Yeah, that's what I thought I heard.

Instead of abdicating parental responsibility (responsibility is a
good word, I wish more parents would look that one up) and blame
others, why not step up and make the hard choices (you know, the
ones that parents have to make) and cancel the account.  It was
a physical danger to your child.  Protect your kid.

Sheez.

The rest of this article is nothing more than a rehash of how
people "with problems" can make those problems even worse, nothing
new here.  But for your kid to be physically at risk from a game
(or a cartoon) and to allow them to continue to play (or watch)
is tantamount to child endangerment.
