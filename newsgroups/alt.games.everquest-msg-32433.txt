Hehe

I know which of my spells stack with each other (I'm a Druid not a dr00d), I
just want to make sure they aren't overwriting another caster's DoT (the
Necro/SK line comes to mind) so I can tell my groupmates not to bother
casting or save my mana for DD's.

But I'm sure the info on this thread has helped a lot of younger Druids!

Thanks!

Drywit
