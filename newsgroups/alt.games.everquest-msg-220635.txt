They may hit hard, but the xp makes it well worth it regardless, 
depending on your level.  I can get far more xp in a tier 3 pop zone than 
anywhere else I go to xp with a group.  Even soloing, I find I can get 
more xp over time in tier 2 or 3 PoP zones than anywhere else in the 
game.  Of course when soloing, how hard they hit is not all that 
significant, just how resistant are they, and how many hp do they have.
