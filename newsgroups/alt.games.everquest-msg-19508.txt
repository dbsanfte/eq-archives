His review is full of shit.

While I have seen disconnect problems like he describes, they are in the
minority of my experiences.

His total lack of interest in trying to interact  with the actual features of
the game makes the review a fraud.  Revealing which of these features were not
working might have been a service to his readers but he couldn't manage to do
that.

His account of his wandering around like a total idiot was not entertaining in
the least.

The game has lots of problems and was released too early, but his review makes
it clear he had no actual interest in the state of the game.
