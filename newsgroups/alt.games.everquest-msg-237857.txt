To address your points, Gohrus, and I thank you for making them in a
civilized manner:

My actions were immoral and unethical, as were hers in my opinion.  That is
the main reason I have difficulty getting over this.

This virtual experience did become a little too real in my life, and I
didn't appreciate it.  But, again, for some reason I could not bring myself
to remove her from my life, no matter my effort.  Taking time off and trying
to forget her and the game didn't work.  I wasn't able to see her in a
detached, mechanical manner, the way she evidently viewed me.  I was
obsessed and couldn't flip off the switch, again the way she did in regard
to me when she was done with me.  I felt disrespected, but at the same time
I had disrespected her.  I felt ignored, but I had avoided her at times as
well.  I was deluded and anguished by an online fantasy I allowed to
penetrate partly into my real life, and it was taking its toll on me.

Based on what I gathered from what she had told me, she was barely affected.
It was all just another series of /moans and
OOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMGGGGGGGGGGGG's.  The only, and probably the best, way
for me to cut it all off and remove every feeling I had was to confront her
husband quite recently (a retribution attempt, kamikaze attempt) and leave
the game afterwards.  I didn't leave the game for fear of what her husband
would say or do, or what she might say or do.  I left because of what I had
done and what I allowed to be done to me, though I tried my damnedest to
control myself.

Yes, she will move on from this and be her own person, but I see the person
she is now.  I also see the person I became during my immersion in Everquest
and that experience.  Thus, the CDs rest in the trash.  The relationship
didn't end a year ago, in fact, I don't even know if qualifies as a
relationship; it ended quite recently when I confronted her husband and she
ceased speaking to me in tells.  Before my confrontation with him, she would
talk to me in tells but would /quit out when her husband was online with
her.

All I know is that there were strong feelings, which I never dreamed I would
experience without meeting the person.  And these feelings needed to wither
and die.
