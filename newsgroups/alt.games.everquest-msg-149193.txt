If your using something that happens and wasnt intended, in VI's eyes that
an exploit.

Drop a weapon and zone with knockback.. grats on your duped item. You just
exploited.

Bypass a locked door using a spell that wasnt intended for that, grats on
your exploit.

What your saying is design flaws are ok, but coding flaws are not?

I think when they design certain stuff, they design it to look good.. not to
be hack/sploit proof.. they are most likely 2 totally different departments
too, so the designers don't have the mindset to bear in mind "sploits" in
geometry
