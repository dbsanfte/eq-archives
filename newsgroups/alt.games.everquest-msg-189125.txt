The Age of Discovdery guild on Test was formed here for a.g.e people
to have a place to group and have some fun. It is designed to be a fun
second guild, or a nice primary guild. We primary cater to those of us
on USENET here, hence the reason I used this public channel.

For those of you on test, I am going to be forming a meeting at 10pm
tonight, and I would like to meet up briefly. I will open a channel
serverwide, so you don't have to really log onto Test if you can't or
won't.

Please listen to the serverwide.age channel for instructions. I will
make a new channel for this meeting.

My agenda for discussion is how we want to do the regular groups, and
how we would like to add members.

Let me add now anyone on the AGE Usenet group is welcome to join us,
we can help you get a few levels to work with us. Drop me an email at
this address, NOT IN THE NG, or send a tell online to any "Age of
Discovery" member. Everyone is welcome, even bizbee :) but excluding
End Times Pervert.

We now return you yo your regularly scheduled flamewar...
