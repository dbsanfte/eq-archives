Two cases:

An NPC (someone's pet?) gets enough buffs cast on it to raise
dex/str/agil by 100+ points.


A hostile NPC gets a stack of stat de-buffs on it that take off 100+
points of str or some other stat.


In both these cases, what effect do the altered stats have on the
capabilities of the target? Willl they hit more/less often? Will they
hit for more/less damage in general? Will they dodge or proc more/less
often? etc...
