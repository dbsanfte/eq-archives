/You/ are the one who first attempted the grammar/spelling fLame.  Any
person such as yourself who claims to be "experienced" on usenet
should know that all grammar after that becomes open game,
particularly the original fLamer's.

just in case they don't understand where to look for a job.  /You're/

Are you posting poetry here?  Didn't think so.  Or, do you use 'cuz'
