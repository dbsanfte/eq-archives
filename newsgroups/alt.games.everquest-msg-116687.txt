I have to say that in the past few weeks I have noticed a significant
increase in the sound and connection problems.  My system has not changed at
all, I still use the same ISP.  Given others posting about having similar
problems, it leads me to believe that the problem is on Verant's end.  I do
know that some of the connection problems I have had are related to my ISP,
they had to replace a router.
