No, it was half an orange, or whatever that color is beneath the blue line,
which takes me, soloing, about an hour of playtime. I don't lose 4 bb at a
whack (unless Gix or Xytl comes out of nowhere and blasts me with 2 smacks)
because I don't group, and I attack only blues, never yellows or reds
because I have learned not to, if I want to keep my enchanter alive.
Unfortunately, she is a bit on the brittle side. I have lost that many with
my druid, kiting griffs in the Karanas, but I also know that A) I CAN outrun
it, having SoW (my enchanter nevers asks for it, so she rarely has it) and
B) I also know that I'm perfectly capable, as a druid of 18 to be able to
kite grifffs and kill them, so long as I'm generally careful not to pick a
red one.

I didn't curse him over that. I cursed (and I've already said that I was in
the wrong and am attempting to make it right) because I had already died and
lost my level twice, and almost did a third time, had it NOT been for the
guards. Please don't tell me that you don't get a bit miffed when you've
spent a long time -- say in a hell level -- getting the level and then you
lose it, whether through your own fault or someone else's? Yes, I took it
out on him, which I deeply regret. And I do still think that I should NOT
have gotten that upset with him, but that *being* upset was a perfectly
valid reaction on my part.
