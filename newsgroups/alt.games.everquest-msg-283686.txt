That's pretty much just what I was thinking. Two of the three scenarios 
result in Sleeper being merged into The Combine. That and the theory that 
The Combine being the initially announced and single beta server (thereby 
already getting a head start in community development) make me believe 
that the seasoned of the bunch will know the odds and play them.
