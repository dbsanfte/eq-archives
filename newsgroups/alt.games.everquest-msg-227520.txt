Same here, macroed my really gimp CH, none of the others.  Rarely have it 
memmed anymore though now that I have quiescense.  Even as the main 
healer in BoT, if there is just one mob, I don't need my crappy CH, spot 
heal with  my mana intensive one, and keep the tank in Quiescence seems 
to do the job quite nicely.
