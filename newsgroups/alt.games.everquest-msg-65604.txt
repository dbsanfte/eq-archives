This isn't actually true.  Verant made a conscious decision to upgrade
from DirctX 8.0 to 8.1.  The chose the path that would dump Win95.
The didn't have to do that.

Still, I understand their actions.  I would put good money on the fact
that people running Win95 couldn't have made up 10% of the player
base.  Hell, if they made up 5% I'd be pretty frickin amazed.
