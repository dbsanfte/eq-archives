But this isn't losing connection. This is program closing down,
something totally unrelated to how good your connection is. The
program closing down is client-side. Unless, again, SOE has a big
"close program" button they can use on any user and just do it to
random people in the Bazaar for kicks, which would be pretty silly.

And, oddly, I haven't seen any out of the ordinary behavior between
the before and after.

Every single patch since I've started playing (just before Kunark) has
brought a good share of people complaining about increased lag or LDs.
This doesn't seem any different to me as of right now.
