Sure the 6th person makes the bonus 30%, but it was 24% at the 5th person so
your math is still wrong.

124 xp divided by 5 = 24.8
130 xp divided by 6 = 21.3

Seems to me you get less xp. There is no magic group bonus at 6 it scales up
from 2 people to 30%. When they implemented the group xp bonus the patch
told us it scales up from 2 people. So only if the person brings an extra
16% does it get better by adding a person. (They bring 6%)
Of course if you are pulling faster it works, but I think the argument was
for a group that was already handling the spawn effectively.......
