Dead Man Floating (often shortened to DMF) is a spell cast by 
necromancers, they're able to cast it starting at level 44. Besides 
the levitation/floating, it allows you to "breathe" underwater so 
that you will not drown, it allows you to see invisible creatures 
and players, and it increases your resistance to poison. Overall, 
it's a pretty handy spell in a lot of situations.

Having those expansions provides you with more level-appropriate 
places to hunt as your character progresses. You don't *need* 
anything beyond the original zones for quite a while, but I like 
having the extra choices of where to go, it keeps me from getting 
bored with the same places over and over for each alt =)

A lot of people don't stick around to wait for thanks after casting 
buffs, but it's always a good idea to try to thank them, as you did. 
When I randomly cast buffs on people, I don't do it just to hear 
them thank me, and many don't, but it sure is nice those rare times 
when someone does take the time to say "thank you". "Please" and 
"thank you" aren't nearly as common as they should be in MMORPGs, in 
my opinion, and a lot of people really appreciate hearing them.

There do seem to be more male players than female, although I don't 
have any poll results or statistics to provide (and I'm too lazy to 
go try to find any right now), but there are still a lot of female 
players, myself included.
