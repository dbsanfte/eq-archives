=46or 2hs, Mith 2her or Exe Axe is good and cheap. If you have more to
spend get one of those Velium 2her which are 30 40 and shouldn't cost
you more then 5k.

=46or 1H, I'd say YK and Cane are best value for money.  and I'd
recommend holding off upgrading them until you can afford a lammy or
css. =20

At 35+, duel wielding would have a better chance of doing more damage
as your double attack and duel wield skills get high enough. I know it
feels good when you see yourself hitting double 140 but that doesn't
come often and you can't taunt effectively with a 2h.  I keep both 1h
and 2h skills maxed though. =20

Just my 20 cents.
