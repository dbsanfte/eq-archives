I'm guessing that you are taking this on hearsay and haven't tried it
yourself, correct?  I haven't spent much more time in TS than required
to run to RoV, but in Nek there are solo creatures right at the CL
zone, as well as the beach.  You can find solo treants and bears also.
There is a lot more grouped mobs, but there are solo ones also.

Once you hit 25 and get EL access (which will require a group), the
area near the docks are loaded with soloable creatures.  Even after the
patch that beefed critters up yesterday I am able to solo pretty
readily there, and I get ripped to shreds in a toe-to-toe fight.

There are plenty of places to solo, at least up as far as 36 so far,
you just need to keep your eyes open and look for them.
