I don't know about the mage / cleric combo, but my enchanter was getting 
some guild "help" from a 51 druid in Ferrott fighting the lizards just 
outside CT. They won't last much over 33 (I wouldn't think) and the casters 
could be fun for you (Enchanter chain stunned to make them easy) The xp was 
good. I made level 31-32 in about 2.5 hours.

Annother option may be Eastern Wastes or the brute caves in WW.
