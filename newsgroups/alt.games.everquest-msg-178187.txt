If you don't *need* wireless, don't bother.  It's more expensive and is also
slower than traditional ethernet.  If you can't stand the clutter of wires
and don't want to do any wall-fishing (which is usually not a problem, but
sometimes you can run into funky baffles and stuff in older homes) than go
for the wireless.  If you do decide to wall-mount some ethernet plugs, the
faceplates and hardware can be surprizingly expensive for a few pieces of
plastic.
