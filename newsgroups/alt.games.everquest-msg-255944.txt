You're crazy. The issue you're seeking to resolve is whether raiders
are more competent than non raiders on average. You seek to resolve this
by restricting your sample set to competent players. It makes no sense.

Its like saying 'Lets see if spanish speakers are IQ 100 or above
more frequently than english speakers but we'll only test people with an 
IQ of 100 or above'

It makes no sense ;)
