Bored, I lent one of my level one characters a copper hammer of
striking.  Great thing about this weapon is that it procs from level
1.  Then I noticed I was hitting up to 16 points of damage even though
the damage listed on the weapon was (1) due to my level.  Granted,
this was on test server.  Unfortunately my character's dex was below
100 so I didn't see too many procs before I got bored and logged ;)
