I have the same sound card and have had the same issues. I ended up
reformatting and reinstalling everything on my system last weekend, and
things seem to be better now. I am using DirectX8, but I don't leave the
music up at all. I was having the same issue where the music was all
garbled, but installing the latest drivers fixed that. You might just
want to go to either Creative's site, or your computer manufacturer's
site and see if you can find the latest drivers.

Hope this helps!

Brent
