Monks aren't the only ones that can FD... to that note, and basically this
whole thread...why not make FD, Hide, Sneak, etc all AAs?  Well, basically,
everyone shouldn't have them.  It encourages interaction...if you want an
ability, you play that class, not play X class then whine because you want Y
class's abilities.

One would assume that you could learn to play dead just as easily as you
could learn to Forage or Tailor or master Jewelcraft...after all, it IS just
a skill, right?  (c;
