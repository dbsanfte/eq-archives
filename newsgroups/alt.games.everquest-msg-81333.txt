Where the fuck did that come from? Lokari's posts have always had a lot 
more informational content than yours (or mine, for that matter), and 
she's done more for the community than half of the posters here rolled 
together. I know the two of you have flamed each other on occasion, but 
sniping at someone who's not around to respond is not going to earn you 
any sympathy, or lend any weight to your position.
