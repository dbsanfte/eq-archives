I actually very rarely end up in a maze of underwater halls, after I fell

Nono this doesn't work. You have to afk them while sitting at your desk to

You see a lot in me just being bored at staring at the spell book.
I talk about staring at the spellbook. Oh, did I mention I only talk
about staring at the spellbook? Or maybe I should have said somewhere
that I was only talking about the spellbook. But hey, ok if you see
a whole universe of issues in this.

Oh yeah .. today I manage to sicken myself. Flame me :)

: might sound like fun to you but I doubt it does to anyone else.

See? That's why I don't want to stare at a spellbook :) I think you
got it now.

: The game is stacked against you, a single 45th level mob is a match for 3

: doesn't have to worry about hot keys or lag or what spells to mem but the
: computer has no real intelligence and it is assumed the player has, thus
: being able to over come all the odds stacked against them.

Sounds about as interesting as playing a pen & paper RPG when the
Gamemaster goes like 'Oh .. uhm .. you can't walk that way .. uhm well...
you just can't .. ok?' when players walk off his designed maps...

: You want more spells to be able to mem, sure, I want more hitpoints and

Yes. Just because I'm lazy, less because it gives an advantage. It does,
however.

: while we're at it can I hit as hard as slate, please, he's a lower level
: than I am.

All the things you see, it's amazing. Do you intend to discuss or offend?

: While we're at it, can we also reduce or remove falling damage, you'd never

Well, you see. The spellbook. Ah no .. forget it.

: Oh yes, I am going to extremes but I am trying to prove a point, hundreds of

Ah, that's why I must like what others tolerate, ok :)

: dealt with as part of the game and put made it to 50 the 60th level. They

I see. God mode cause I don't want to stare at the spellbook.  I hope I have
upped the wordcount of 'Spellbook' in this posting enough so your enhanced
sensory arrays get to see it.

: I'm not saying don't make criticisms about the game but what you are
: complaining about are there as penalties not bugs or oversights. The Spell

That's what I'm not agreeing with, see. Not being able to melee is penalty,
staring at a spellbook is lame nusiance to me. It really is. Even if you
don't agree. I can assure you, in my opinion it is. Really.

PS: Spellbook
