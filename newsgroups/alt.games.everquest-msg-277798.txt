I think perhaps opt in all players, and let those who know how to play 
(e.g. uberalts) opt out.

I think that could work. I don't know what the influx of true newbies 
is, nor the percentage of experienced players that rolls their alts 
untwinked, or at least comparatively so. 

Maybe a more formalized system in the lfg tool to simply say: "untwinked 
player looking to group with same for adventure".  Provide some 
structure to it...

Anarchy Online has a series of autojoin chat channels players get 
dropped in as they join the game and get started. Experienced players 
would just drop them and rush to their friends, but it might be quite 
beneficial to newbies to have them all autojoin 'newbie' channels by 
level range, to make finding eachother easier. It would almost be like 
logging in and finding yourself in a guild of level 1-15 characters, 
with newbie chatter going on all over the place... and when you turn 
12th you autojoin a 10-20th channel as well... etc

Its FAR better than finding yourself in gukta cold and alone...so very 
very alone ;)

I think stuff like this would help, but its going to take more than that 
to solve the problem. EQ culture has to change, and it has to be done at 
the developer level, by designing a game that allows people who PL to 60 
grind 100 AAs, PL to 70 and THEN play EQ to exist without utterly 
dominating the landscape as the 'best way to play eq'... because it 
isn't.
