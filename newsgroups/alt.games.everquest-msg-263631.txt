I'm trying to install the parts mentioned above and it looks like everything
is going but the "front panel connectors". I can turn on the pc and the
reset switch is fine. When i look at the cables, they have a triangle on
them, instead of a + or -. What polarity is a triangle?!! The manual is
completey unhelpful. I tried doing a search on google but the cables on the
net always have polarity symbols instead of this weird triangle stuff.

I have looked over the case and can't tell what sort it is (apart from
server tower)... I'm worried that i might have plugged the cables in the
wrong way and blown the power and hard drive LED. I assumed the triangle
symbol was negative from what I could gather (in other words the labels face
inwards like this picture
http://www.melbpc.org.au/pcupdate/2405/2405article3-16a.jpg ) . If I can
just get past this last step I should be able to format the new drive and
install eq again!
