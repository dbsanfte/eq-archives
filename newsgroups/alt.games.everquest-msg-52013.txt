Its against Verant's rules and they could go as far as banning you if
they knew. They can also ban for writing a naughty story in a site
totally not connected to Verant even though it did not say that in the
EULA. In otherwords Verant, and their EULA kind of says it, can
basically ban you for any reason they want to.

Its also frowned by on some people in this newsgroup to do it here.
However, there is a site called 

www.playerauctions.com

which allow such auctions and probably several other sites.
