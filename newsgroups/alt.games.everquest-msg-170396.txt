EqWin has been working for a number of years now. I used it often to "park"
on the bazaar..... Why would it be the end of EQ when it jas been around for
a number of years now. I think it would be a new income for all them clerics
needing to rezz people that went and checked their e-mail while they were
medding up :)

Those are already out there. You really think this is something new?
Besides, you don't need Windowed Mode to "cheat" on a game. Loading a module
in memory before you start the game is plenty. For many games you can
pre-set a number of values like unlimited lives, unlimited health, money
etc... and load a small program that takes care of that. If EverQuest were
that easy to hack don't you think someone would have done it?
