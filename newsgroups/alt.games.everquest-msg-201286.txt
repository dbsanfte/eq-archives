BLAH

My guild is finally getting close to the Elementals.  Reading your message
kina deflated me.  7 hours for 2 drops!?!?!?  Thats insane!  Previously, all
the Planes had stuff dropping regularly, I can't imagine why SoE created PoP
like that!  As it is we use a form of DKPs for loot distribution, & PoP
really has caused inflation.  2-3 hours to kill a God for 2 drops, 1 maybe
Uber.

Nothing beats VT for drops....  but now there are 6 guilds VT capable on my
server, 4 on a rotation, the other 2 "too uber" for VT (lets hope they stay
that way).  The best part of VT is how you can populate soo many slots with
unbelievable items.   I went from FT 1 to FT 12 there.  Huge upgrades!  & I
got a few more slots to fill. =)

I am kinda surprised that with the degree of difficulty to get to the
Elementals, that the loot is that rare.  Think maybe SoE fooked up?
