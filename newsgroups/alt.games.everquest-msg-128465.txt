I am a necro (lvl 12) and once in a while I want to mend bones my pet.
However at times, when he is at a distance it is soooo hard to target
him with the mouse. I also found that there is no F-key (that I know
of) which targets your pet and a hotbutton with the command

/target %m

does also not work.

How can I easily target my pet??
