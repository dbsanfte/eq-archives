Natural (non item/magic modifier) endure breath depend on Stamina, not lvl
or swiming skill.
I went LD when crossing a zone and i was in autorun (num lock). When comming
back i was under water with half breath bar used. Very disapointing ...

In Oasis with my mage i use waterstones to med under water far away from SG
/ spectres ...
But in Iceclad, snowguardian love to swim too (maybe a pathing bug)  and
Lodizal dont use ice bridges. Even under water (of course depending your
spot) you cant be totaly safe.
