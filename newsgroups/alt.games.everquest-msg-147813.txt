If you were in my guild I'd give you the same answer as they did, "you're on
your own."  Too many people, when they say "spend a little more time
helping..." are actually saying "spend some time PowerLeveling..." and after
3.5 years I can barely get enough energy to PL my OWN alts (well, ok, I find
the time... <g> ).

Or, if you're not talking about PLing, what kind of help are you talking
about?  Grouping?  Well, if you can't FIND a guild group...MAKE one.  That's
the biggest thing that pisses our ruling council off more than
anything...people whining about not being able to slip into pre-made guild
groups and not willing to make their own...but more than willing to whine
about it.

If your guild CANNOT support your rogue due to lack of level 40ish players,
find a guild that can.  There's no shame in leaving a guild that's not
meeting your needs.
