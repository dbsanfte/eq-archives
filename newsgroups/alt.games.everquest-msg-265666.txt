I said I hate drive by healing being possible. I didn't say i hate drive 
by heals, or drive by healers. But knowing that its possible also means 
powerlevelling is trivially easy, and I do hate that.

I simply said the mechanic that allows one allows the other. And you can 
rest assured that a number of people are doing it. Probably to their 
friends or 'guildies' and not to random people on the street.

I prefer to play a game that rewards egaging challenging play over 
mindless tedium. Sitting in a corner powerleveling with hilev buffers is 
far more efficient than actually playing the game in far too many games.

I shouldn't have to log in and make a choice between having fun and 
getting a small amount of xp, or boring myself to tears to get a large 
amount.

Then its not a KS issue.

Indeed. Although I'm pretty sure that isn't what you meant to say.

I mentioned several other games. The only one that prevents some helpful 
buffing is EQ2, to my knowledge. And even that is at the players 
discretion. They can yell for help and ulock it if they want.

I can't recall a single superhero comic or cartoon where a superhero 
would do a drive by buffing/debuffing. So I'm skeptical that its in the 
spirit of anything.

Rush to the assistance of... sure. 

Besides nobody has ever said that 'asking for help and getting it' is 
killstealing, and even games with mechanics that prevent assistance 
allow players to unlock it if they wish.

But to keep this on topic, letting you buff a fellow superhero doesn't 
diminish the amount of xp, loot, faction, influence, or any other reward 
your target might get. So its completely unrelated to killstealing.
