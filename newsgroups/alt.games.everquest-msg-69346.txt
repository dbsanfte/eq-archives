Suggestion:  check your IRQ's  (run: msinfo32, then open the 'Hardware
Resources' tree, and select 'Conflicts/Sharing'.. is your sound card and
graphics card on the same IRQ?  if yes, you might want to physically change
the PCI slot which your sound card is in, because having them on the same
IRQ does have a tendency to have conflicts, especially between ATI and Sound
Blaster (I had an ATI Rage 128 and an SBLive).  I'm assuming your graphics
card is AGP, so you can only change the slot of your sound card, if your
graphics card is PCI you can change it as well or it alone.

Just a suggestion
