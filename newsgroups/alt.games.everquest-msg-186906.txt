Ordered EQ Gold (to set up a second account, and to get the nifty stuff 
lol), and got it today.  The included figurine that came with it is the one 
that is shown on the EQ Store site (Paladin looking dude with a wing 
adorned helm, sword in his right hand, and shield in his left..shield has a 
wolf head or something similar on it), and was wondering if anyone knows 
what it is.  Also appears to have some kind of mail armor, and some of the 
detail work looks as iff it were elvish.  

Any ideas?
