You say should get more, which would make sense, but I'm
saying that the points systems I've seen thus far aren't a case
of "getting more" but rather one of "getting all"

Guy A plays twice as much as Guy B, and gets twice as much
loot, no problem.  Guy A plays twice as much as Guy B and
gets three times as much loot... hmm, well OK, I can see the
reasoning to support this.  Guy A plays twice as much as Guy
B and gets 20 times the loot?  No, I can't see that.

Of course if you can put raids together with nothing but A types,
thats fine and you can have a pretty casual attitude about the
few type B or C (one quarter the play time as A) and D (one
eighth) players.  But assuming your raids require those somewhat
less committed players to also attend, then those players should
also be getting some of the rewards.

Of course I'm told that there are points systems out there that
don't turn out as badly as the four or five I've seen in action,
that I'm just a victim of a series of bad systems and that it
isn't the fault of the points plan in general.  I can't argue against
that, since I haven't been in a guild with a system that works
as described in this thread.  Possibly the new system the guild
I'm currently in will work out better than the ones I've seen in
action thus far.

A year ago while a guild I was in was discussing a loot system
I designed one that I thought had promise, I'll see if I can dig it
up or remember enough about it to start a thread on it.
