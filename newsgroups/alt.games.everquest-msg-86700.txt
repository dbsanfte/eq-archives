Yes, many people have this same problem.  The music is very stuttery and it
gets very annoying. I have no solution, but I do have a suggestion.  One day
it got so annoying that i just turned the music volume all the way down to
off in the option.  I left normal sounds on, however.  these past few months
without eq music has been great tho =P
