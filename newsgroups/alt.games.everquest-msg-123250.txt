Others answered the question, here's just an added tidbit.  "/as" is the
shortest way you can type it (one letter shorter and it makes you anon :) ).

If you want to assist Fubbington you can usually get away with typing simply
"/as fub"

For melee and nukers it's almost imperative to create a hotkey for a
particular person.   Typing /as %t  WILL work, and is fine most of the time,
but can be cumbersome.  It's probably just better to create a full hotkey
for the person
/assist fubbington
type out the full name in case some guy called Fubar <pun intended> comes
into the zone...if you were still doing "/as fob" it might just start
assisting Fubar instead...not good!

As for other classes, I went about 2.5 years before ever creating an assist
hotkey.  My healer classes would /assist the critter for heals, and of
course my enchanter RARELY assists except to see what the main tank is
beating on (most of the time I don't really have time for that and simply
mezz the first one I target and hope it's the right one. :) )
