I've never had a problem with bards dropping manasong during combat.
But as for the bard that joined the group I was in in my mid 40s,
started manasong and went AFK because I as solo healer needed
manasong during downtime more than his l33t pulling skills... it
wasn't long till he was kicked out, and he's still on my shitlist.
