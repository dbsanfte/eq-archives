That's what I did on the last build here. Worked like a champ.

Just as a note, if you are using a flat (ribbon) cable to connect your
hard drives to the Motherboard, they often have two connectors for HD's
on them. Check the jumper settings on both Hard Drives. If you set them
both for CS (i.e. "Cable Select") then you will want your new HD on the
*end* of the cable, as that is the one the machine will first try to
boot off. The old one that you want to copy EQ from can go on the
"middle" connector on the cable, and it will default to being the slave
drive. Or, you can save the hassle and just jumper the new one as Master
and the Old one as Slave before booting. If you are using two round
cables with only one connector on each end, you'll want to do that
anyway to be safe.

However, Instead of just copying everything over in one shot, I was
paranoid about the installation. You may want to be also. I took all the
CD's and installed EQ on the new machine from scratch, specifying the
drive and directory I wanted it to go to. Then I copied the old drives
files over that directory. The first time it hits a match (identical
file name) it will inform you the file already exists and ask if you
want to replace it with the newer version. If you say "Yes to All", then
it will replace all the original files with the ones that have been
patched on your old drive, giving you the current state of the files.
This will also ensure that all your customized files go into the right
spots.
