Don't you find it odd that you can get so upset over someone spelling "your"
as "ur", so upset, in fact that you start writing to them telling them how
pathetic you think they are, yet a real life issue can make no impact.

I have no problem with you calling peeople "retards" or calling black guys
"spades", but go say it to their face, not behind some anonymous medium.

I admit I'm sensitive to people making derogatory remarks about disabled
people, and I am not ashamed of it. You are sensitive to people's spelling,
for some reason someone writing "u" instead of "you" sends you into some
sort of frenzy. Addles your wits so much that you pretend you need
tranlations.

You need to get a grip on what's important and what isn't.

I know I can't stop your Archie Bunker mentality, but one day perhaps,
you'll have a few too many drinks, maybe forget where you are, and call
someone the wrong name....
