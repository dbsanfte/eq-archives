Say that when you're in Kael with a 30 person raid, which has to finish the
15k hp level 55'ish giant that came with the giant who dropped the quest armor
piece, then random the item among the 15 different players which are able to
use the piece.    It's generally not possible to get that all done within two
minutes.

But hey, you do what you want.   Good luck when other people start hearing
about it.
