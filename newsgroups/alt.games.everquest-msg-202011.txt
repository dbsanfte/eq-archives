    There is a second zone out, but it's in a place where nobody would use
it that's doing XP.

    Be interesting to see an elevator installed in Droga, taking you down at
the start.

    Question, since I've never gone there for XP (the faction hit makes me
very uneasy): are there a number of named mobs with drops, or do the various
Loam etc. items drop randomly?

>  Velks - Not much needs to change here.

    The Castle area could use a bit of tweaking to make it more attractive
to the high-end crowd. And if they can, get rid of that area behind the
zone-in. Mobs used to get trapped there all the time after a train and
they'd never path home. Then, as soon as one person with low health aggro
ran towards the zone-in the whole thing would come boiling out to kill him,
and would then start to path home. The screams of all the players caught by
the unexpected train FROM zone were quite amusing.

> The pit is dumb design since you can't get out. Or can you?

    If you go far enough, you pop up into the Castle. From there you can get
out through Upper Dogs. Nobody said it would be easy!

    They'd be a neat feature if there weren't so many buggy 10 K fall spots
in there.
