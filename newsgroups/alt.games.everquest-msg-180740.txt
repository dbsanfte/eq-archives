Ah, I think I see where you might be making a mistake. "Mudflation"
can't be stopped (at least not in EQ1). Items that were worth a
fortune Pre-Kunark are selling for peanuts now, or simply given away. 

A few of the broken factors are:
1. More powerful items have entered the economy with each expansion.
2. Items last forever in EQ (unless sold to a vendor or destroyed).
Each time the "Big Foozle" is killed another Uber_Sword01 enters the
game world. Eventually supply will outstrip demand and the selling
price of the sword will drop.
3. "Money" lasts forever in EQ. (unless spent on vendors doing
tradeskills, or destroyed)

If you pay market value for item_X today, it is a sure thing that when
you go to sell it, it will be worth less. Only the rarest and most
useful items retain a significant portion of their original vallue
(like the FishBone earring, or Fungi Tunic)

Think about this for a minute...What is there to spend money on in EQ?

The only thing you "must buy" is food and drink (unless you can
forage). That is the only real "cost" associated with your character.
All of the plat you collect in EQ is there to spend on
items/spells/tradeskills. 

At some point a character will hit the "wall". This is the point where
the only item upgrades available are NoDrop/Raid items. If the player
is disciplined and doesn't blow the money they make on alts/twinks,
friends or tradeskills, they can very quickly amass a fortune in pp
and have nothing to spend it on.

I think everyone will agree that the economy in EQ is "broken" to some
degree. It is just one of those things that you need to learn to
accept and not let it get in the way of your enjoyment.

The answer to that is yes and no. Many NODROP items are not that
great, or are common drops. The Goranga Club (12/23) is a perfect
example. It's a great weapon by any standard, but it is a common drop
and sells for 100pp on FV where it isn't NODROP. Even some Planer
armor (which isn't sold all that often) is not up to speed with some
of the drops available from expansions.  

If you accept the premise that the economy in EQ is and has always
been screwy (or broken if you prefer), then it isn't that hard to see
why prices differ between servers. The age and number of active smiths
on a server will dictate leather padding prices. The total number of
players and "uber-guilds" on any given server will directly effect the
price of farmable items.
