 I've never reall shouted it over a zone, but occasionally
might tell my group or guild when I hit a milestone level
such as "Ding 60   8^P"

 Using those abbreviations whilst asking me for a TL or GG 
will only guarentee that I will ignore you unless you are a
VERY good friend or guildmate.

 Every few minutes is ok with me, but using /shout, /ooc
AND /auc for the same auction WILL cause me to put a person
on /ignore.

 Sure don't help. And bear in mind most will have guilds that
certain info will be passed onto that guild through guildchat
to several hundred people.

 The inspector can also turn off inspecting inadvertantly with
a /inspect off command as well. I do this on those heavily
populated raids to avoid just this problem.

 The naming policy has changed. Some of those names will 
result in banishment and/or account suspension without
notice now. Yay.

 Sometimes I will help out a newbie if they ask nicely rather than
true begging. Getting to know me of offering a stack of bat wings 
might yield a generous donation. An obvious effort must be made
though.
