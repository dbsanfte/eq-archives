Is your caps-lock key stuck, dipshit, or did you just graduate from AOL?

"Modern medicine is the art of keeping people alive long after they
have lost what made them people in the first place."

There you have it in a fucking nutshell. There is such an incredible
industry built around palliative care of the elderly that I am very
surprised to see that more of our tax money doesn't go to keeping the
drooling checker-chewers in Depends and tube-feedings. Even more
astonishing is the ever-more-numerous breed of spineless dipshits who
insist that the already ponderously bloated and outrageously
overpriced American health care system expend vast amounts of resources
to keep their insensate, geriatric progenitors alive. They fail to
grasp that, rather than being a "Mercy Killing", a DNR (Do Not
Resuscitate order) merely means not subjecting this poor, drooling
near-corpse to even more humiliation and pain. Not that humiliation
and pain are necessarily bad things, they're just fucking expensive
and in the end, we all wind up footing the bill because you didn't
have the requisite balls to say: "For the love of Geebus and all that
is holy, pull the fucking plug so we can get around to squabbling over
Granny's money!".
