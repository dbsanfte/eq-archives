Stop actually wearing the tolan's crap for tunare's sake.  Hardened Grey 
Flesh Sleeves.  Definitely get the solstice earring, it's not that 
expensive even if you have to buy everything in bazaar.  You might look 
into an eyepatch of plunder if you feel like camping stormfeather for a 
while.  Get your helm of the tracker at 55.  It's a very easy quest in PoG.  
Valorium rings.  Silver chitin wrist band is nice, bracelet of fortitude, 
bracer of benevolence if you have decent CoV faction.  Pick up a drape of 
the proud for your shoulders (just replaced my IGS with one last night).  
Barbed rubicite is *really* nice for this slot if you can get a group to go 
farm 4c with you.  Tae ew chain tunic and leggings the minute you hit 51.  
Kingly boots of splendor are nice and should be fairly cheap.  Blessed 
Faydark Thunderbolt is a nice upgrade for your bow slot, twisted longbow 
even better when you get a few more levels.  Cloak of the maelstrom is a 
nice back piece.

Thurgadin gate potions work as well.  Requires a little farming, but much 
cheaper than gate potions.

Another option is the OT gate hammer.  Sticks you right next to the PoK 
book in OT.  Pick up some puppet strings, find a friendly enchanter to tash 
the guy and stick malo on him with your SHM and you shouldn't have too much 
of a problem getting him charmed.

It's spell haste.  The difficult part is a rare drop off a 24-hour spawn 
that DTs.  Good luck.  I think most rangers get this by getting lucky on 
the way to the next island.  Eyepatch of plunder has 20% spell haste and is 
a bit easier to get :P

Swiftwind is pretty easy to get.  There are two parts that require a little 
planning: one is getting the swirling sphere from sky.  But clearing the 
griffon island (usually required to get to the islands for warrior and mage 
epics) yields like 12 of those, so just find out who's going to sky and 
have 'em get you one as it's easily MQ'd.  The other is Jaeil, just because 
of the adds that come in while you're fighting him.  Take along a pair of 
good lullers, a healer and a decent tank and you'll be fine.  A good bard 
is nice as well for the group DA so you can jump down and skip a bunch of 
content.  Make a brell rogue to scout the keeper before you go.

As for earthcaller, get a swarmcaller and call it a day.  Unless you have 
friends who absolutely love wandering around in hate while you track nameds 
every day for a couple months.

Start looking into getting a nice 1hander to go along with swiftwind.  Once 
you switch to archery it might not be a bad idea to equip that scion axe 
for the veng2.

Also, I heard a rumor that the dmg nerf on rec. lvl weapons is broken and 
you get full damage regardless of your level.  Can't confirm that though.

Anyway, that's the general direction I'd head.
