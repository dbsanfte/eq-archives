Oh Please not another overly simplistic anti Druid rant.  The ability of an
individual Druid to function effectively in a group or during a raid  depends
only on that player's motivations to group and raid. True the druid is a jack
of all trades and master of none but a Druid DOES bring valued skills and
attributes to any group or raid IF the group - raid leader uses him in an
effective manner.

A 50 + level Druid is an effective Healer, buffer and or dd dealer in a group
and has a series of rather effective group buffs.

A druid becomes weaker as he  goes post 50? Sure. Thank SOE for the nerfs.
Actually I think SOE should simply eleminate the Druid as a class and
redistribute the remnents amoung the other classes. After all you no longer
need ports with PoK  right? And who in their right mind would ever want SoE or
group Howler?  No one.

Sorry. Leveling a Druid is not harder or easier than leveling any other class
until the Druid is in his high 30s. Then it becomes more challenging to level
him due primarily to the exclusionary attitude articulatred in the clipped post
above.
