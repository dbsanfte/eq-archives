They die even faster and for less mana if you charm a rat.  A swamp rat
charmed and hasted can kill about 4 or 5 (possibly more) Tsetsian flies
without a heal.  Then you can whack the rat for more exp and find another
one.

I prefer PoD, PoN is like DL mk2.

Also, CoK limit is 53.  Ravens spawn as high as 54.  Nightstalkers are
always CoK charmable, the young bat is always dire charmable.  The larger
bats flying around near the necropolis and inside the caves are only
charmable with Command of Tunare (63 spell, charm level up to 60) though.

I killed the level 56-57 ones at level 53.  The only thing is that you'll
have to root a lot more.  That was what the Warden Symbol is for.  Granted
however you'll probably need KEI to do this until 59 or so.  Still worth it
for the significant upgrade that the armor is for most people.  (only piece
I still wear at 64 is the legs though)

Quite so.  11-12 solo kills in PoS per aa point.  Granted I'd probably make
exp faster if I didn't keep going after giants and dying. (need a beard for
BoT key)
