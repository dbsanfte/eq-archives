Or, more importantly, have you ever let some minimum wage high school
student swipe your credit card for a gasoline purchase? That gives
them a permanent imprint of your card number and security around those
slips is lackadaisical at best.

As for SOE/EQ, I have never heard of anyone's cc information being
stolen through EQ unless they gave it out to some third party
pretending to be SOE.
