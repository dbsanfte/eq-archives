It's not just the higher end guilds...:( Everyone seems to be focussed
on his/her personal mission. We have guild disbands since nothing gets
done. Even if some do say we aren't really capable of even doing epic
1.5! (this is true imho)
Add to this the EQ2 beta and we're short off falling apart. :/
