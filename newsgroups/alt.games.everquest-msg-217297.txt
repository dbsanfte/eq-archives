Happened last night on EMarr too.  From what I could tell the entire 
server could not cast.  To fix it you had to zone or camp.  GM broadcast 
that you should camp for 10 minutes to fix it.  That did not seem to be 
necessary, just camped to character select, came right back, and it was 
fixed.  Fortunately, it happened before we started pulling a named giant 
in PoS.
