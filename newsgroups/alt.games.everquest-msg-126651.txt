RAAF. That was one of the many humourous episodes during basic recruit
training. They just heap shit on everyone to see who breaks because those
are the peeps they don't want. I went through with a whole flight of radio
technicians with a few comsops to round out the numbers. These guys were are
exactly the type that gary Larson had in mind when he drew this:

of common sense between the lot of us.

Towards the end of our recruit training our collective real world stupidity
took it's toll on one of our ADG (Airfield Defence Guards) Corporals and he
had to be shipped off to the drink tank. I can still imagine him to this
day....
