That would have been a great strategy, too bad he couldn't follow it.  I 
took sympathy on melees for awhile with my necro that way - I'd tell 
them to let me dot them and get them to the pull spot, then to grab them 
while I got off a fear.  Inevitably, they'd start pulling other things 
while I was off finding something.  Because after all, casters can't 
pull ;p

I did group with a necro last night as a rogue.  THAT was fun.  All I 
had to do was wait until she slowed and feared, then I got to backstab 
the hell out of anything that came along.  Whee!  And since she had two 
pets, even two or three pulls didn't leave her struggling for mana.  It 
being relatively empty, we didn't stop pulling very often.  :)

I understand kaev's point - as a melee, there is NOTHING I hate more 
than standing around doing nothing.  However, there are times where, I'm 
sorry, it's just more efficient that way.  That tank was wasting their 
mana on heals and making a fool out of himself in the process.  If you 
MUST get your killing instinct out on something, go kill all those PHs 
and spawn some more giants.
