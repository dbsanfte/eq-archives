All really depends on how good/bad your current equipment is.
For instance The Cleric legs are extremely easy to get. While the stats
are not that great the AC is nice.

Used to be good. It let you cast invis to animals. This would
kill your pet quickly. This is not as useful anymore since they
changed the pet agro rules.

Again they all depend on your current equipment. Most of the
wizard items suck. The quests for the weapons all have the
casters having 2HB staffs. Not very many people use 2H weapons since
you can get greater stat boosts from having items in both hands
rather than just one item.

Here is a good reference list for those quests:

At the bottom of the page are links to sort them in different
orders. Very handy.

Oh yeah that's a great quest. Huge exp for that.

Um yeah that's the jboots quest. You already have that one listed.
