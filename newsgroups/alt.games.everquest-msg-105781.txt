so neriak is  a dungeon? I can't get jboots to work in there.  Of
course they not gonna put dungeon bonus in netherbian lair, like they
said: easy pulls and easy kills, what more do you want?  go to a real
dungeon like Mistmoor (which allows sow btw) or Unrest (indoor and
allows sow as well). Both give xp bonus.  And are great for 20s and
30s, if you like the challenge of a dungeon :)
