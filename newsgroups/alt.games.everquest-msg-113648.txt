I guess beggars are at least good for laughs sometimes. I was sitting in WFP
doing some brewing, when a shout goes across the zone: "Can someone plz give
me some plat for armor and songs?" I ignored the first shout, but this guy
started spamming the shout every ten seconds or so. So, just for curiousity, I
do a /who all beggar_500243. The beggar in question is a level 1 MONK!
Laughing my butt off, I /occ "You're a monk, right? Since when did a monk get
songs? lol" The response? He shouts again asking for plat for armor and
songs...but just one more time. After that, he soon logged off and I didn't
see him the rest of the night. It's pretty bad just being a beggar; even worse
when you forget what class you are begging for. :-)
