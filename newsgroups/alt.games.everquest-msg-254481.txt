Ok, yet another newbie question. Given the sheer size of the game, is 
there any good resources out there to point me in the right direction 
when it comes to getting new items based on my level?

The situation I'm currently in is that I'm about to finish my 
Truthbringer armor quests but figure I need to update my sword (still 
using the original) and my shield (using one I bought off a vendor). The 
problem is, I have absolutely no idea how to find what items I can or 
should be going for. I've checked a couple sites but there are literally 
thousands of items. I have no idea where they are, if they are 
appropriate for my level/class/world/etc. Even the site eq.crgaming.com 
that has a dedicated Paladin section doesn't tell you what items are 
good to use when.

Any links/pointers?

Thanks yet again,
nib
