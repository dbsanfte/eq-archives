I accidentally somehow turned off my window that shows buffs and other stuff
(no idea how, maybe a bug?). I was trying to turn it back on but forgot the
key command.  I know ALT+T is target, ALT+S is spells, and a few others.  So
I was trying to ALT+every key on the keyboard until I found it.  I
accidentally hit ALT+TAB and left EQ.  It didn't crash or illegal operation,
just as if I had /quit to get out.
    Is this what is supposed to happen?  When did they implement this?

Also has anyone noticed the new warning when you start EQ?  Warning about
experiencing seizures?
