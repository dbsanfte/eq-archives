I always found bards to generate remarkably little aggro,and couldnt' 
figure out what the aggro reducing songs would be good for; only mob 
that really hated me was the one who charm had broken on, and even he 
could usually be peeled off me fairly easily.

If bards made better tanks, I'd have been looking for an aggro 
increasing song, rather than a reducer.

Things being as they are, heck, not annoying mobs isn't a bad thing at 
all most of the time.
