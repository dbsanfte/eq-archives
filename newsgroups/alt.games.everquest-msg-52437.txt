This is very good tip to be sure to get spelling right on your hor key if
You put your hot key /assist %T. The frist person you assist will have his
name replced.
Prior to assisting hot key 1= /assist %T. use to assist Jakugg
after assisting hot key 1 now = /assist Jakugg
with some of the names out there misspelling can be hazardous or even
deadly.
