Well I tested it using a 3rd level monk (carrying a torch to stop DW) and a
15th level Cleric.
/logged with and without SCHW.
Cleric came out with 9% Haste (9% increase in swings)
Monk with 16%...eh?
Ok, neither got to 22% for haste, that SCHW should give but Cleric was way
off...My current conclusion is I fucked it up and need to look at logs again
(and maybe try test again) but I was too tired last night so chose sleep
instead.

I'll do it again, and include some different classes, using 2hb with a delay
of 50 that all will use. If I still think results are screwed I'll just post
a link to logs and someone else can take a look.

I still believe that haste items are effected by level, although it's
looking like the lvl +1% figure was just picked from someones arse, given
the results a 3rd level monk got. Now wondering if non melee classes have a
different haste cap...
