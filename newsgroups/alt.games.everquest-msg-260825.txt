You miss my point.  Why should mage pets cost a malacite and necro pets 
a peridot (plus a bone chip)?  Having them cost just a bone chip is more 
fair.  Its still advantage mage, cause bone chips can't be store 
bought... but the advantage is mild, they are easily farmed or bought in 
bazaar or you can get AA that turns flesh to bone and I think you can 
buy meats that work for that.
