There are always pathetic losers who feel that their way is the only way, and
it's the children who cannot see that time=money.

Because they have the vast amounts of time required to camp the uber-item (no
job, no social life, no prospects) they don't understand how much time this
game demands.  I've been playing for almost 2 years and my highest level
character is only lvl 32.  If I ever want the Molewhacking Stick of Uberness
I'll have to buy it somehow (plat in the game or dollars outside it) because I
won't be able to acquire it as I play.

I remember hearing about the 30+ hour camps people used to do for Jboots when
they were in Najena.  Sorry, 30 hours of my time is worth way too much to spend
sitting around in a game doing almost nothing.
