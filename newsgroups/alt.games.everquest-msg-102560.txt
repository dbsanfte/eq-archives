Stein of Moggok (10 int, handheld, can do after lvl 12, or lvl 8 if
you're a DE ~ good moneymaker for young chanters, it sells easily for
about 200pp on my server); Incandescent Gloves, Incandescent Mask,
Incandescent Wand, Rod of Insidious Glamour (all 30ish chanter quests
which result in a nice item except the Incandescent Wand ~ it's okay but
not really worth the trouble); Tash spell quest (spell is lvl 49, IIRC,
but you can do the quest to get it as soon as you can travel fairly
freely, say 4ish ~ all you have to do is collect coins from various
cities around Norrath, there is nothing to kill.)
