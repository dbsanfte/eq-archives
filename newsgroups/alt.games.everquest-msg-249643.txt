Go with a paladin, so you have easier pulling for a while and then
decent rezzing should you need it.  I'm not speaking from experience
with a paladin, rather from having played a warrior.    

Eventually the paladin's lulls won't work when you start fighting
level 60+ mobs, but until those levels, the paladin's buffs, stuns,
roots and lulls would seem to be much more useful than any difference
in DPS.
