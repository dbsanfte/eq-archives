Its quite possible, not being a trade skiller I've never needed to
know.  I've yet to see a peridot or invis potion vendor where
any modifiers unfavorable to me seemed to be in place, and the
price break always goes to best at 106 for me.  As these are
the only items of any interest (relatively expensive items bought
in bulk) thats as much research as I've done on the issue.
