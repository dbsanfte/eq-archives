It's definitely longer than 1 hour, more like 3, I was there for 3 hours
hitting track regularly, and after the first reaver went down, there weren't
any more than that on track for at least 2-2.5 hours.

It's also not worth the time to go to CoM and kill the reavers if you can't
get them all, unless you're going to kill one of the Lords/Ashiirs, who's
already up, and reavers are just an added bonus to that.
