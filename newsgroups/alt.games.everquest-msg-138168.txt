I need a place where I can safely solo from 23-30. Here are some one I've
tried and can't anymore

Paludal Caverns: Nice, but all the Phlargs con teal, and the bandits are
always in groups
Lake of Ill Omen: So overdone, plus I have to run through DL or OT and FM to
get there... yuck
South Karana: I'm  too low
Netherbian Lair: I get so many adds in this zone even when I'm careful, plus
its bugged and sometimes you don't get exp, happened to me once :\

Where can I go for some relatively safe soloing at level 23?

Thanks!
