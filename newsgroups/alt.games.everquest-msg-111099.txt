But...but life begins after 60, doesn't it?

Well, it would be nice to see the economy drop back down.  Most players go
through the bulk of the levels looting things that they have no use for, and
selling it as vendor loot, when it was orignally good stuff.  I would like
the ability to have a use for going through a dungeon.  In this way, it will
be a nice change.

Still, I think Verant could give some bonuses based on EQ1 characters.
Nothing too severe, but a few more points to play with, or a reduced XP
curve in the early game, or a better starting weapon.  Some sort of
recognition.
