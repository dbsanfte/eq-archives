Grr -still- no work done on plate mitigation?  My cleric would really like to
see mitigation similar to other plate classes, instead of merely wearing heavy
and expensive metal colored t shirt fabric!

Eep, no place is safe today... not just from screwups on their part, but just
the old "I know nothing wanders past here, we can take a breather" spots will
all have to be re-examined before use.

Scary, but certainly fair... assuming "appropriate" doesn't mean "worse than for
healing a PC with similar HP totals"

Up to a third each?  So three chanters working together get no exp... and 6
chanters working together get negative exp?  Or is it just "up to a third"
total.  And if the latter, is that "between all charmed pets" or "from any
single charmed pet" and... wow this seems either really hard to implement, or
poorly explained.

I don't remember it ever working any other way, my bard had to work like a dog
to keep mobs hitting his charmed pet, which they wouldn't do at all if anyone
else engaged.  IIRC (it has been a few months) the only way to have mobs go
after charmed pets was to do as little as possible to the mob and stay well out
of melee range.   Charmed pets in group actions, therefore, were far less
effective than for soloing purposes, which I often thought was the point.

OK, admittedly this always seemed stupid to me... hmm I was going to complain
about its triviality, but looking at some of the other fixes, heck, they are
going after trivial stuff all over the place, other than saying "this should
have been fixed in beta" how can I complain?

Hah, that makes a LOT more sense!

Wow, huge change eh?  Assuming this includes wolf form and skellie form, and
that those are "non-playable races" this kills several faction fixes for non
enchanters, and also enables use of wolf form (and I presume skellie, but
haven't been one much) in lots of previous "no-no" areas.  Since those forms
were more than just appearance modifiers for their adherants, that latter part
would be a very good thing.

Umm, why?  Attacking or casting a spell breaks invisibility, that's an old
chestnut from back in D&D days, I understand it.  But hiding and then moving?
When moving normally doesn't?  Whats the difference between hiding and ducking
around a corner?  Whats the difference between moving out of hiding and just
taking a stroll...or for that matter, taking a flying leap to duck across an
alleyway?

No more "you have to zone to see the change"?  Hmm, and now to "boot strap"
languages, we can just sit and talk to each other, no more get two skill ups,
zone, then I teach you till you get two skill ups" process?

So here's your "big jump in value" item of the patch for all you speculators out
there?

So these quests just became 6 times as useful as they were before?  Wow, that
seems like a big deal, should be much easier to get people to help do these if
they work for whole group.  Heck, even if you are flagged already, help someone
do it and then swap places with your alt or guildmate to get him flagged.  On
the other hand, there goes some of the exclusivity principle, now anyone over 46
can get any of these flags, no?

Wouldn't it have been more fun to put content behind that door???

Bergh, commenting on patch message instead of demanding my money back on the
unplayable time, so no YCNHMS
