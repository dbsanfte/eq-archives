A spoonerism is not a misspelling.

And unlike an actual misspelling, which stills "says" the
"disallowed" word/phrase in the reader's mind as he reads it,
a spoonerism requires the reader to actively disassemble,
rearrange, and then reassemble the name in his mind in order
to come up with anything "offensive".

It's like the woman who called the police because a man
walked by her house every morning whistling dirty songs...

What's next, banning ANAGRAMS of dirty words?

If the reader has to rearrange a name to make it "naughty",
I fail to see the problem.

And just how many names might end up "bad" if suitably
rearranged?

You're forgiven.
