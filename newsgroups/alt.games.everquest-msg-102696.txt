Sometimes I'll see people arguing about something stupid, if it escalates to
obcenities I automatically put the offender on my ignore list.  That way
I'll never have a problem with that person.  I don't care if I've never
grouped with the guy or just walked into the zone, if you are smeghead
enough to be shouting at someone like that I don't want anything to do with
you ever.  Don't ask me for a SoW, don't EVEN ask me for money, you aint
even gonna get an answer cuz I put you on ignore 6 months ago.
