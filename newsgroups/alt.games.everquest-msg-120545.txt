Hi All,

Is anybody else out there having problems logging in?

The response I keep getting is one of the following

Log-in server is currently TOTALLY INCAPABLE OF COPING

unable to contact Log-in server DESPITE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR WITH A SLEDGE
HAMMER

or most worrying of all, this last one

either your Log-in name or password is TOTALLY UNKNOWN TO US, WE'VE NEVER
HEARD OF YOU, BUT WE'RE KEEPING YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER ANYWAY,
BWAHAHAHAHAHA.


or is it just me?
