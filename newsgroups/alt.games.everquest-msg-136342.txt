With all the talk of how EQ makes for socially inept people that we hear
about in the news, I think this is one example of an extremely positive
aspect of the game.  The generation gap that exists between parents and kids
is often a result of having totally dissimilar interests.  When something
like EQ can bridge the gap I believe it can create a much healthier family
atmosphere for a child to grow up in.  I applaud you two.
