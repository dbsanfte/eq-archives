A guide told me this one about report....
You can only report once per zone in...  and a report shows the last
ten lines in your log that are VISIBLE to you....

so....  scroll up to the start of the BS.... do a report.... Zone...
scroll to the next part you want to report....  do a report,  zone....
rinse and repeat till done... that way you can get the entire
conversation in.....

Luck to you... and go break that little bitches drum....
