"Auto IP assigning," or being a DHCP client isn't a problem with the
Linksys...it handles it just fine.

If you've made adjustments to the out-of-the-box Linksys broadband cable/dsl
router you've probably goofed somewhere.  I think there was only one thing I
had to change, but for the life of me I can't remember what it was, but I'm
99% certain that it didn't have anything to do with ISP IPs that change when
you power down.
