I got tired of hitting the damned key so I disabled it.  Not by the registry
method(s) or ripping the key off.  I took the keyboard apart and put some
masking tape on the bottom of the key so that it doesn't make contact when
it is pressed.

I never use those "new-fangled" keys, so they are just a waste of space to
me.  I hate 'em.
