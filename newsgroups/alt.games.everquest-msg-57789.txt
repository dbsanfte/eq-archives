Hey guys. Im new to the game and on the fennin Ro server. Anyways i want to
get some of the necro gear from Najena. The only problem i have is that no
one in my guild says they don't want to raid it because it's such a low lvl
area. Anyways, i got the dark circlet from there and i was wondering what
would i be able to solo in there? If anyone has some advice let me know
please. I  am a Dark Elf Necromancer of the 15th season.
Moratol.
