Then again this "kid" was 21 and had his own apartment.  If the kid
didn't have mental problems i would say: Hmm I think that it might be
a good time for him to take care of his own damn self.  But because he
did have documentable mental issues he should have been getting
counseling.  However I'm sure the job at the pizza joint had damn good
medical coverage.  Either way it's not Sony's fault.  Anyone feel like
giving her a call?  I think this is the link to a search that will
bring up one of two possibilities for her phone number.
