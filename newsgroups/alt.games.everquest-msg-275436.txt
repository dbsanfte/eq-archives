Well they actually sell advanced characters directly as well. In theory I 
personally don't find a problem with people buying and selling accounts but 
I also understand why other people may not like that. It is usally easy to 
identify an ebay'er. I can even understand why people may want to buy an 
account to try out a class once they are high level and not go through the 
leveling early on again (yes I know most people can get to 50 pretty quick).

The problem is since people agreed NOT to sell characters I do find a 
problem with it on EQ and WoW (again if they changed it I would not care)

DOAC allows for selling of accounts, but not equipment and money, they also 
have the /level command to get to 20 if you have a level 50. (A decent 
compromise here)

Some of the people here find selling wrong no matter what the user agreement 
is, that is fine. But I think the majority are saying you should not sell 
because you agreed not to.
