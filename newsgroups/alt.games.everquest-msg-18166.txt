You have it all wrong.....

"Daddy" = "Johnny Two Shoes-18"

It's the same player.

He "paid" for his "car" and did plenty of "shit" to get it.

Example:
If I spend 20 hours with my level 49 Druid collecting cash and gear
for my lvl 15 Warrior. I personally earned all of it. The characters
on "MY" account use the items "I" earned.
