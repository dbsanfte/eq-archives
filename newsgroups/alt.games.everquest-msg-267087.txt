I deleted my Cleric that I had on The Nameless server, but now I am thinking 
of starting one again.  (this will be the third CLE that I have made).  Is 
it possible to get either of them back or do I just have to start over 
again?  It is not like either was very high, less than 16 was the highest, 
but if I can forgo the early levels and buying the spells it would be worth 
it.

TIA
