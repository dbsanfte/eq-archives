I'd take the $100. I don't really have a use for 1,000,000 plat (yeah,
sure, I could come up with something to spend it on, but there's nothing
I really need), and I wouldn't sell it for RL cash. So, while I don't
really _need_ the $100, that's what I'd choose because, well, at least
it's real rather than virtual.
