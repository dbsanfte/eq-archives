Indeed. The Conquest guys found that when you directed the mobs to a certain
spot it got stuck there almost unable to move or hit anything although the
tanks could hit it. They simply drove all those guardians to that spot and
beat it to crap.
The only "flaw" in the trick was that it could summon the clerics (and
tanks, but it wouldn't because those were in melee range already) in a
position in which it could hit them. A few mages using CoH to get them back
was all it took to keep everyone alive.

Plus they used a small bug with using the Rez spell, for when you have the
pop-up of "Do you want to be rezzed by xxx" you couldn't be slowed with the
slow spell of the guardians.

(This is all based on what I understood of 5 message boards and a few dozen
articles on it)


If this accidentally happend then there is no problem, but they continued
doing this without notifying the GM's of this bug. That's what's called
exploiting.
