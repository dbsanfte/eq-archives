    Hi Right now I am a Level 11 Dark Elf Necromancer, sitting around
in Neriak and have been unable to find the bind affinity Spell. I
don't have plains of power yet so I have to travel the old fashioned
way. does anybody know where I can buy this spell or what level I need
to be to use it.  So does anybody have directions to the Bind affinity
spell.

Thanks

NiGhTWind
