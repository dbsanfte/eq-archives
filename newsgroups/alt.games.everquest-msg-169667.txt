I didnt see it listed anywhere. I killed an npc in Nektulos yesterday, he
was a paladin, walking near a bunch of rodcet nife followers. He was light
blue to my Druid (15 at the time) so I killed him, I lost faction with the 3
main factions in qeynos and got better with the bloodsabers. I looted a
lore, no drop helm called the Cracked Helm of the Lightbringer.
Can't wear it but I have no clue what it is for. He respawned instantly
after I killed him. He is close to the halfling spawn around ruins.
