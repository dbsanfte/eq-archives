Never played Starcraft, warcraft, etc eh? Never had a good counter
rush to save a flag carrier in TFC eh? Never had the pleasure of that
final desperate fight to the capture area against massed defenders?
Zigging and zagging between demos hurling grenades and pyros flaming?
Or in this case Warriors charging you and archers snipering, while the
Wizards lob in nukes and the sneaking Nightshade gets ready to
backstab him after quietly sneaking in behind.
