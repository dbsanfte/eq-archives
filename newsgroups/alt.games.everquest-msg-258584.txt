Heh, sorry. I didn't notice this post until now for some reason.
 
You seem to have about all the bases covered well, though I might suggest a 
clicky invis item. I also rolled up a throwaway ranger to help me with my 
search for newbie quest armor components. My warrior was level 11, and I 
just put him on auto-follow as I ran the 1 ranger around tracking 
everything. When I fould something, I would switch to the warrior and kill 
it. The problem I had was that the ranger would invariably get aggro from 
something passing by and end up getting killed. No big deal except then I 
had to get them back together again before I could continue. It would have 
been *really* nice if the ranger could have tracked without fear of aggro. 
Your godly AC and HP numbers for a level 3 might serve the purpose just as 
well, though. :)

Oh, and on the Gloomingdeep charm, I'll never start another character 
without going through the tutorial now. It's a very nice item to occupy a 
slot I've never before been able to fill.
