Baking is cheaper. Second easiest to GM after Brewing. You can get to
191 (IIRC) on store-bought stuff making Patty Melts. (They sell ok in
the Bazaar too. I sell a stack for 10pp, and sell on average about 4
stacks a night.) (Firiona Vie here)

Once you get to 191, it becomes a bit harder... There are a few
recopies after that that I'm looking into. Cheesy Griffon Casserole
requires all store bought materials (on the order of a few copper or
silver each) with the exception of Griffon meat and eggs. (Eggs are
easy to get, so many will work. You can usually buy them for a
somewhat reasonable rate in the Bazaar, or hunt them (or forage them)
up for yourself. That will take you all they way to GM. (And the
product should sell well too, as it has +4 WIS, +4 STA on it. Good for
clerics, Druids, Rangers, and Shamans)
