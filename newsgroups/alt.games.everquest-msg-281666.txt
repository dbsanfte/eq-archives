My friend bought a Sony laptop and it actually came with an EQ demo on
it  :)  He copied over his folder from his desktop PC, and off he
went, no problems.  He regularly brings it over and runs it from my
router, if we have a day of EQ, and from what I've seen it is very
good at running EQ.  While he used all the graphic models for a while,
like me, he later turned them off as being pretty but superfluous. As
you say, while laptops are pretty speedy these days, they usually
don't shine as regards graphic cards - shared graphics cards are
usually the norm.
