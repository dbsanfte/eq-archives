The law has two parallel methods of action, Civil penalties, and
criminal penalties. Of course TGIANAL!

He is misusing intellectual property because he is using the software
in violation of the EULA. It is a clear civil case. Easily actionable.

Theft of intellectual property, from a player is definatly criminal,
and has been talked about here with a password stealing scheme.
Accepting, or providing a conduit for selling the gains of that
enterprise is considered accepting stolen property, which is a
criminal charge.


Mr. Yantis appears to be in some trouble here, civilly and criminally.

Morally , a cheater, in the gamers subculture is the lowest of low
lifes. We all push the rules and are rules lawyers from time to time.
Argueing about the rule is part of the fun. (WH40K has a 1800 line I
used to call to take the fun out of it)

Mr. Yantis, in my kangaroo court is a cheater. I declare him in
contempt of court, and I sentence him to life plus 30 years for
cheating, warrior profiteering, molesting an Orc, and dating a zombie
less than 16 years undead.
