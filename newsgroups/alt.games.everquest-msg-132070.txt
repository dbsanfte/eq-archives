Stop it now! Repeat after me. Druids ARE NOT wizards. Druids have some
ok nukes
but wizards own the nuking arena. Thats what they do. I mostly come at
this subject from the frustration of being a tank or rogue and with a
druid as the only healer and them being constantly oom from nuking all
the time. /em sigh

it just seems theres another halfling druid born every minute and they
all act the same.

p.s. is Linvarwen on seventh hammer a halfling by any chance?
