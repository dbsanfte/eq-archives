The last time I had a breastplate awarded, it was for my then level 52
rogue in Plane of Growth. It's the only BP I've ever gotten.

While playing my cleric, I've only gone in on a breastplate once--the
Mail of the Void from cursed cycle. I've passed on the ornate BP
because it's just not much of an upgrade from racial armor for
clerics.

In Sheava's entire career, I only upgraded her BP once from the Dark
Prince Regent I put on her at level 4--to an Architect's Bejeweled
Chestplate.

Now that I've had to restart my cleric, I'll be working towards the
Royal Attendant Breastplate of the Sand again. With the correct
augments, it looks like this:

Royal Attendant Breastplate of the Sand
AC:79, Sta:13, Cha:11, Wis:10, Int:10, HP:140, Mana:100, CR:12, MR:12,
PR:12, Flowing Thought II.

Obviously, if I were awarded a VT breastplate or better, I would skip
this. But, that's a breastplate that compares favorably to a lot of
raid-level gear, even at the VT and planar level. And, you don't have
to wait for your guild to clear out the backlog of people needing BP
upgrades to get one.
