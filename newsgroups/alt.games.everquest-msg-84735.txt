With the Luclin gates in N Karana and Greater Faydark, one of the best trips
I could suggest is
a trip to Lake of Ill Omen. There is a gate straight to the Kunark islands,
but the zone it is in is
much too high for your levels to take. From N Karana to the Nexus, you can
then gate from the
Nexus down to G Faydark. Then run thru Butcherblock (avoiding the guards)
around to the docks
and make your way around the dock wall to the dock with the shuttles. take
those to Timerous deep
and make your way to Fironia Vie. Jump ship and make your way to ill omen.
There are enough
holes in the guard post coverage to make this trip, but it will be difficult
enough to make the trip
exciting. Word of caution, you will need invis to go from FV to ill omen as
well as SOW. There are
high 20 to mid 30 lvl giant spider people to avoid as well as a NASTY necro.
there are PLENTY of
people going from FV to ill omen that it shouldn't take much to get a guide
to lead you. Also, print
plenty of maps of the zones so you can preplan your route. I have seen MANY
dark races make the
trip so I know it is possible. Also possible is to make the trip from oasis
thru the barge, but I dont know
this route. it is designed for the dark races to take, so I have had no
experience over there, yet!
I took 2 characters (dwarven paladin and human enchanter) from around 17 to
23 and 27 there. good exp
and LOTS of hunting space.
GOOD LUCK!
