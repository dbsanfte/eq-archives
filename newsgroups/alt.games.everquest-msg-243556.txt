In Echo Caverns, way in the back, is a camp called the Taskmaster camp.  A
bunch of skeletons surround a snake, the Taskmaster himself.  This is a
pretty good camp, as the skeletons are easy kills and even the Taskmaster
will be easy for you.  Cast Invisibility Versus Undead to move your BL and
CLR to the back of the cave, where a little cubby-hole makes a perfect place
to pull.  Then use Pacify to lull the skeletons allowing you to single-pull
the mobs until you've broken the camp.  You'll still "only" get 1% per kill,
but they are fast easy kills, and once you've cleared the Taskmaster camp
you can find blue mobs nearby to pull and kill until you get respawns.

The Taskmaster may occasionally drop "Undead Snake Organs".  Keep those; if
you get three you can turn them in for a necklace that gives you Enduring
Breath.  Always a handy thing to have.
