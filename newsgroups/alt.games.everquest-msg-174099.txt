No, no, and no again.  I will continue to beat this drum until my vote is
counted!  Aside from all the allegations of Gore's ballot stacking, many
Republican votes, that were legitimately cast, were not counted, mine
included.

If a candidate wins a state by more votes than there are absentee ballots,
then the state does not have to count those ballots, and they usually don't
in order to save money.  Any servicemen who voted in such states by absentee
ballot, which is pretty much the norm for servicemen, did not have their
votes added to the count.

Gore won the majority of the votes that were counted, but the figures are
extremely dubious.  If we're going to base ANYTHING on that comparison, then
it had better be an accurate one.
