I'm just wondering, is this something that's reportable or
petitionable (when you consent another player to drag your corpse and
they deliberately drag it to somewhere dangerous)?  Or is this one of
those things where you're SOL (like if you allow another player to
"try on" some nice piece of armor and hit the "trade" button and then
the other person takes off and won't give it back to you)?
