    Sure, if you suck. Or if you go to the places in game that are horribly
overcamped. Dream King suggested some better places to go. Even in some of
the overcamped areas, you can get good spots depending on time of day.

    Hrm? I'd be stunned if you couldn't find an all-you-can-pull area in
Fungus Grove (to name one example). Between the never-camped bug hive, the
Fungusbeast camp under the bridge, three Caller quests, and the various
areas up front (which are admittedly prime AoE targets) there's a ton of
pulls.

    Not a good idea. Unless you're willing to go deep in, where the traps
and what not are, you will bump heads with folks there. It's quite rough for
an XP zone. Honestly, you'll have better luck outside in Maiden's Eye.

    It figures you are familiar with it. :-/

    Agreed. But that doesn't make their analysis of how things are wrong, it
just makes it irrelevant.

    Is all you offer to the group pulling? You have no useful buffs, deal
crap damage, can't tank? Wizards are quite one-dimensional. They offer
ports/evacs, damage, and snare. That's it. If that damage isn't up to snuff,
the reason to have a wizard really goes poof.

    Of course not. You play in slow groups where a melee shaman could keep
up the kill rate from the sounds of it. But try thinking about it a bit. You
see no problem with a class (not just wizards here, any damage-dealing
class) having the exact same damage output at 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57,
58, and 59? With absolutely no way of upgrading it, period, unlike a melee
with upgraded weapons/haste or, well, just about any other caster? My class,
cleric, gets two nuke upgrades during those levels when wizards get none.
Something's wrong there.

    What, getting higher DEF? You're right, they don't have that problem.
:-)

    Or are you somehow implying that casters have favoured status in EQ?
Care to back that up, or shall we cross it off as class whining? I'd say
something here about "Gosh, I guess the folks at Verant like mathematical
proofs, too," but that would be rubbing it in.

    You still don't have enough. I posted numbers showing you that the
disparity is still there.

    <uber attitude (c) Jazz> ROFL, Dennis so powa! Wanna know how I solo in
Fungus? I nuke a mushroom, then start chain-casting my 54 and 56 nukes while
tanking it. No need to self-heal, since they spend all their time casting.
Finish at two bubs of health, just right for a CH. Tanking Fungus is NOT
terribly impressive. Come back when you've tanked something that actually
hits hard, like a Velk's named dog or some of the trash mobs in Ssra, then
we'll talk about your tanking skills. </uber attitude (c) Jazz>

    After seeing this list, I'm beginning to understand why your groups have
lots of downtime. Next you'll say you were in a group with ranger healing!
