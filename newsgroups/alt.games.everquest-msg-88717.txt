I used to have the same problem but I solved it in a different way.  I got
together
with a girl that kept tarantulas as pets.  4 years and me buying myself 4
arachnids
later I am pretty well over my fear of spiders.  hehe

Gotta be careful when looting out of game!  Neighbors really don't like to
see you
skinning their dogs or cats.  And they look at you really funny when you go
after
dogs and cats with your quack stick (broom handle with a rubber ducky taped
on)
waggling your fingers saying "Ahh  I feel much better now!"
