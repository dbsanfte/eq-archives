Is it a rare drop off of a common mob or a rare drop off of a rare
mob? If its a drop off a rare then just wait for it to spawn and
engage first. You have as much right to the rare as they do.. and if
you engage first.. the mob is yours unless you lose.. then its theirs
if they can kill it.

So long as you don't kill the mobs they've engaged first.. absolutely.
My main issue was you coming on to gloat about engaging in
kill/stealing from newbs.

Common courtesy is not kill/stealing someone elses mob. Even less
common courtesy is posting to this newsgroup about it.
