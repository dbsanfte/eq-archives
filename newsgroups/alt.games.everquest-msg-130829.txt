Orc camps in EC, Dervish camps in WC and North Ro, the Goblins
or Chessboard in Butcherblock, "Cog Valley" and the Dragon
Bones in Steamfont, Befallen and Crushbone are all typical
choices at that level.  But it's difficult to say without
knowing whether there's racial issues (a DE shouldn't hunt in
Crushbone, for instance) or travel issues or even just lag
issues (Luclin has some very good progressive zones, for
instance, where you could group and just move from zone to
zone and camp to camp as you level.)

I suggest looking at the level guide at www.eqatlas.com for a
list of possible zones and using the command "/who all 11 15"
to see where people are on your server around your level.
Obviously, there has to be people around so you can group...
