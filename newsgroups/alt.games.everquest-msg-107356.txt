I just wonder one thing.. If you were to give your pet a nasty mean really
good 2K weapon.. Will that be gone if the pet dies? Or can you loot it back?
So you really should not give it something veeery good?

And does anyone know if a Beastlord pet have any advantage of weapons? (ie.
it cant hold any weapons cos mine is a tiger, and bashes, claws, kicks..
whatever as it is.. )
