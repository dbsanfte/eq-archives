    They broke a specific agreement between my guild and their guilds. We
had agreed not to kill Rallos Zek. In return, each of their guilds had three
consecutive days to try the encounter alone (the trigger repops in 20
minutes) before we started a proper rotation on it, one day for each.
Furthermore, at their suggestion, we would get the loot from the first kill
they got. On day four or five of "their attempts", a patch made the
encounter easier so they banded together, rushed it and killed it. Unlike
other servers, where the "boss guild" just kills Rallos and ignores other
people, we actually made an agreement that gave them chances to learn the
encounter and kill it.

    We had done the exact same thing in Luclin - we had a one day each
rotation on Emperor in Ssra. They claimed that this rotation was made to
hold them down, and that we should give them unlimited attempts at Rallos
and not kill it for ourselves. So a loot-bearing mob (and his loot is very
nice) is up, we know how to kill it, but we shouldn't so someone else can
get a shot. Someone else that, on other days when they COULD have tried it
(back before we started killing it), instead went to whatever loot farm zone
was up and farmed. Uh-huh. Most of the people in my guild were upset that we
gave them as good a deal as we did, since we didn't have any reason to give
them anything except to keep guild relations good. That they'd break the
agreement just drove home the point that they can't be trusted.

    On a personal level, it disgusts me because of their motives: pure
greed. They're in it for the lewts, and in one case we believe in it for the
$$$ of playerauctions plat sales. If someone joined your guild "so you guys
can get me my epic", how would you view them? We've seen posts by you where
you say that you don't want folks like that in your guild, because they
aren't interested in progressing guild goals, only themselves. I view the
server as having goals, and guilds like those two do nothing to advance
those goals.

    Other people, like Furor, have mocked them for being unskilled zergs.
/shrug - I know that neither of them has done Rallos on their own yet, but I
don't hold that against them. To me, the hatred stemmed from breaking an
agreement and from the motive that drove them to break the agreement. The
people I feel sorry for in this case are the members of the two guilds that
hadn't done all the bosses leading up to Rallos Zek. From what we've heard
and seen, the two guilds aren't going back and doing those encounters to get
those people flagged because the loot that drops isn't good enough. Ouch.

    Hopefully I was specific enough. ;-)

    So all of the following would count:

    (1) By doing XP in PoEarth, you blow ALL the ring events there. To
trigger a ring event you must kill all trash mobs of a given type in a
specific order. People doing XP blow that order all to hell.
    (2) One of the guilds has started doing the Fennin Ro script. Not to
kill Fennin, though, but to kill the intermediate bosses that drop lots of
glyphed rune words and some other lewts. That blows it for a week.
    (3) The zone-ins of Water, Fire, and Earth used to be so safe that you
could AFK there for the night. Not any more!

    As they start to explore, we're looking forward to more of the same.
Like the events to get keyed for Xegony. They can also be blown, although
the respawn there is only 3 days. Earth is the one that worries me, as it
can be rendered perma-blown by folks doing XP.

    In a way, yes. It would be fair to say that I'm upset that the people
we're competing with aren't competing so much as just consuming. I look
forwards to the fourth guild I mentioned making it to the elemental planes,
because they're skilled players that want to get to the end game just so
they can say they got there. Even if we lost the race to PoTime to a guild
like that at least we'd know the interests of the server as a whole, the
competition for inter-server bragging rights, was being held up. Right now
people hear the name Quellious and think "server with zergtastic gimps with
no skill", and that upsets me.
