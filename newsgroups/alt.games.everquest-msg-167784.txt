Strange. I know for the longest time, felines were KOS to rangers and
druids 'til they fixed that a few months back. Maybe they broke it
again.

Simply put, if you don't see a faction hit message, then nothing
happens to your faction. Kill bears and wolves to your heart's
content, you will never become KOS to them (The exceptions being
killing the ones in Surefall and I beleive Jaggedpine...).
