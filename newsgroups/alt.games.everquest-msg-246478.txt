And while you were being sarcastic about it, in the end, that's all I 
was saying about the continued "dumbing down" of the game. Why bother 
grouping that level 28 warrior if you can heal up to full in three 
minutes?  Not like it's going to change at this point, but it seems like 
SOE is more and more driving the game into a situation where nothing 
counts but the end game, and they want to make it so every new player 
can just shoot up to level sixtyfive as fast as possible.

This game originally got its "legs", so to speak, from the fact that it 
was a long term commitment to really get to the high end, and to master 
it. And it also built the community it has exactly because people were 
forced to group up and band together to get anything productive 
accomplished in a reasonable amount of time. Both of those aspects of 
the game have pretty much been washed out.

Was this change disastrous to the long term health of EQ? No, not in my 
opinion. It's just one more in a long series of changes that dumb it 
down to the least common denominator.
