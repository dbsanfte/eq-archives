Aye, the only true balance will be achieved when ALL classes have ALL
abilities. And everyone has Uber gear so they may walk Norrath as gods!!! I
want a /godmode ON command!! What they really need is a Save/Restore ability
so you can play like Quake. You know, SAVE game, blow thoughtlessly into a
room, get creamed, RESTORE game, replay.

Sheesh. If being a cash cow cleric is your dream - then play one. I don't
think I've EVER met a cleric not willing to do a rez for small donation (<
100pp) - usually optional. If you are in a guild - they are almost always
free. These players have stuck with a support class - sitting in the back,
healing and rezzing your ass for level after level, and now people want to
take away the thing that really makes the class special.

I can't wait till Enchanters are dual wielding/double attacking with 6000hp
and 1500AC. And tanks are clicking their insta-heal Uber nuke Breastplates.
Then the game will be REAL fun.

My apologies in advance if I offended anyone, nothing personal intended.
