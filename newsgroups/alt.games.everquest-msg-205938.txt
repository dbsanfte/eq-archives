Puller:  Monk, ranger, tank.  Any class can pull, some are just more suited
to it than others.  If a group of mobs needs to be split, a monk or
shadowknight is the way to go.  Outdoors, a ranger is great since he can
track a mob and fill it full of arrows on the way in.  One of the fastest
exp groups I was ever in had an enchanter chain pulling.  So pretty much
whoever knows the area best or is best suited to the situation at hand.

Tank:  Warrior, shadowknight, paladin.  Monk, ranger, rogue, beastlord or
even a pet will do in a pinch.  You don't want pure spellcasters tanking,
but a shaman can hold his own once a mob is slowed.

BTW, isn't MT and MA the same thing?
