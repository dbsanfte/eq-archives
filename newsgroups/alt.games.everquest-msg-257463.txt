You should always be able to pacify.  Stand a few paces back from the door
(2 floor squares in tak), open the door, hit F9 four times and spin the
camera around to face you.  Now camera is inside the room looking back at
you and you can see the two door guards and a few further in.  Pacify to
taste and then you can enter and scope it out better.  Alternately you could
buy some stalking probes.  They cost 30p in bazaar with 5 charges, and when
empty they sell back to npc vendor for 14p.  Just light one up and send it
in.  Nothing aggroes and you can open doors and target creatures for pacify.
