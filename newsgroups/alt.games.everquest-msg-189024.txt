After having left EQ for a couple of years, I've now returned to the game.
In my previous
life, I had never been to Tox.  However in this one, I spend some time in
Tox and
I'm wondering if it's normal for the NPC's to kill steal out in the forest?
I mean sure, you
expect a Guard to k/s if you train a spook to him, but these freaking
Erudian Emissaries
just wait 'til you've spent all kinds of mana and whammo!, take it.  Am I
missing something?
