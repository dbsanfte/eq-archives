WoW. This more or less doubles the effectivness of 6 man groups.
Previously you would need to kill 5 times faster than a soloer to make 
the same xp with a 6 man group.
With this you need to kill 2.79 times as fast to keep up.

This will make groups much more common.

It will also speed up leveling something cronic.
