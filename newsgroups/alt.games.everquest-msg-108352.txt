True, but not the whole story.

You must be level 59 to learn it.   It costs 6 AA points.   Unfortunately
Casters Realm does not list the prerequisites, but the minimum prerequisite
for a class ability is 12 AA points spent in the Archtype levels, which all
have prerequisites of 6 points being spent in the General levels.

So... in order to get what is really a necessary level of control over thier
pet, Necromancers and Mages (and Beastlords, I think) must gain level 59, then
repeat level 51 over 24 times before they have enough AA points to buy it.

Way, way too much.    I don't care how they do it or justify having only a few
classes that get a class only skill at Archtype level, but IMO, there is
absolutely no way the minimal level on this should be beyond 55 at the latest.
With minimal or even just token AA point spending.

(And no, I don't play a pet class, not even on an alt.)
