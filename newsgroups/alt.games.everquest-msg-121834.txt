Wow! You were still pulling thorks at 46? The hunters are (I think) all
light blue to me at 43 and there's never enough warriors to consisently
get four withou a few walrus tagging along.

Have you tried staying there and quadding the rhinos? I know the loot
would totally suck, but I saw a yellow-to-me druid quadding them, and I
could already single pull them at 42. Might be an option until you can
do CS reliably.
