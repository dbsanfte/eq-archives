I never thought it would be this easy, not that I plan on making a career
out of soloing.
Put swift like the wind on your pet (animation), give him another 1 handed
weapon so he dual wields. Pull a level 40-44 mob, tashanian, shiftless
deeds, dot, maybe a nuke. Finish up with a fear (got to find places where
pathing works for thiss). Low dark blues i dont even need fear... pet can
tear them up himself and finish on half halth. It is a joke.
