Yeah well, try being a monk (or rogue).  I have c.r'd countless people
(friends, group, and total strangers) in dark and dangerous dungeons, which
posed a grave threat to my life (and I've died in the past doing c.r's)..

And i've *NEVER* been offered a donation!!   Of course thats not why I do
it, so I wouldn't accept it anyway... I do it to help people, just like
casting SoW / c2 / rezzing is helping people.

I have never, and will never, pay for a SoW (I wouldn't pay for *ANY* buff).
Of course im not the kind of player that /shouts NEED SOW!!!!!!�%�!%$�$!,
and spam harasses people at druid rings etc.

If somebody gave me a smart ass rude reply because I asked for a SoW.. well
in the future im sure they'd need me more than my bot army and I need them..
and I doubt they'd get my help.    I rarely even use SoW unless Im going on
a big run... or porting into Waking Lands and needing to get away from
Wuoshi

Btw I do have a cleric, and I do have a policy on determing if i rez
somebody (I don't care what plat they are offering)

If its a guildie or friend, I will log the cleric in and run to them - no
questions asked

If its a random /tell, it depends on my hunting rate... if im in an empty
velks (i.e more up than I can kill) well sorry, I need every drop of mana my
cleric has (its not often im in velks with less than 10 people)
If the pulls are slow, the zone is over crowded, im getting ready to
camp/zone whatever, then sure I'll rez.

If they spam /shout or ooc, or just bug me in whatever way, then tough
fucking shit.  Offer me 1k, im still not rezzing you.

If I've just zoned in I will rez them.. and moreso if its some poor person
thats been LFG for an hour, and like died in a train or something.
