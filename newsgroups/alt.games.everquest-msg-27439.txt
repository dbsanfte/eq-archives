I have a question about the effects of Wolf Form on faction... I know it
resets all positive and negative factions to "indifferent", but I don't
know if that's a permanent effect, or whether you build on (positively
and negatively) that whenever you are in Wolf Form.

Currently, I'm doing the Bread Run to Oggok to get enough Clurg faction
to get the Stein of Moggok (pointless, I know, but level 30 is
bboooorrrrrinnnnnggggg). After a few runs, Clurg is still indifferent to
me, and won't give me the Stein. Is all the good faction work I'm doing
being reset by Wolf Form, or will I eventually be amiable *while*
wolfed? Or, alternatively, do I need to cancel Wolf Form in order to
reap the benefit of the faction work (or reap a big Ogre boot down my
throat, more likely)?

I tend to think Wolf always resets the faction, because I've got all my
positive Firiona Vie hits while in Wolf Form, and yet Nubs Blackgranite,
the vendor at the mill in Lake of Ill Omen, (who is in FV faction, I
believe) regards me as indifferent when I'm a wolf and as "warmly" as a
human.

Should I take the risk and show myself to Clurg as I am? Have any druids
here completed the Stein quest?
