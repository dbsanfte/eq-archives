I really suspect you have a conflict in resource management between
the sound card and the video card.  Just from what you describe, at
the point the game needs to shift video mode is when you go bye-bye.

Just for the sheer halibut, could you go into device manager and
completely disable the Audigy?  Reboot, and try again.
