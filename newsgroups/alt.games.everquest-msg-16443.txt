One of the most amazing things in this article was the quote that in a
country with a population of 46 million, 2 million people have accounts.
That's effectively 5% of the country's population. Can you imagine if EQ was
that pervasive in the US? How many freaking servers and GM's would it
require? Within months, VI would buy microsoft just to get a better deal on
the software, and probably a few other companies for the hundreds or
thousands of servers.
   The streets would be nearly empty in some towns, tumbleweeds blowing past
the emaciated dogs and cats whom nobody had fed in months.
