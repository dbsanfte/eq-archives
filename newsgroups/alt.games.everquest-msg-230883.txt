Actually, they could check a lot less.  Do random checking, ban any accounts
caught.  They just need to catch enough people to make it not worth the risk
for most.

Also, they could use the client for this check.  If the client catches
cheating, it could notify the server, which flags the account.  Then, a week
or two later, they could turn on server-side monitoring on flagged accounts,
catch them in the act, and ban them.  The week delay is to make it harder
for people to figure out that there is client-side checking going on.
