OK, so you've stopped reading, well your loss.

I know someone personally who bought 2 stacks of items from one of the
vendors, felt guilty, and sold them back.  They were rolled back to about 3
hours before the patch.

Before the patch they XP'ed in MPG, died, and got half way through looting
a corpse when the patch hit.  After the patch they did the buying and
selling back.  After the rollback they are at the entrance to MPG, with
none of the XP earned during that three hour session.

So if you'd been patient, you could have proven whether Sony were being
honest or not without having to behave like a 3 year old child.
