1. How many fucking computers are you running now? /boggle

2. Why can't your monk just tank? I mean, for any non raid level mob
your bot army is tackling, doesnt' meemers pretty well do the job?

3. How did you get to sixty without knowing jack about warriors? he he.

Depending on tradeskill abilities, do you have all your bots flagged for
tier three zones? Or if not, can you get them so flagged? I understand
there's some fucking awesome player crafted stuff coming out of there
that puts fierce heraldic to shame requiring drops that come off garden
variety mobs as opposed to just bosses.  I think the INT caster stuff is
called "Eternal Silk" armor or somesuch. Not sure for the tanks, but I'm
pretty sure there's a smithing equivalent already running around.
