Sorry, I have no idea. It might depend on whether another person is
doing the same quest, which is likely. If not then you may just be able
to hand in the other items similar to a MQ. I did as many of the newbie
quests as my patience would allow when they first came out, and found
that many people handed in only a few of the items required and I
received the reward plus some of my turn in items back. I did do this
particular quest, but that was so long ago, my sorry brain can't
remember the details to clearly. I do remember that there were a few
problems with the Human Freeport quests though. Items dropping off the
wrong mobs etc., but I am not positive whether or not they were fixed in
subsequent patches.
