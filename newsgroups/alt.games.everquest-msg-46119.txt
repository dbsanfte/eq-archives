    Looking at some of the responses, you aren't the only one. 8)

    They aren't complaining about their grouping skills. As you say, a
well-played necro adds a ton of damage to a group, additional
healing/mezzing, some mana regen with twitch, snare.... You really begin to
wonder what they can't do. Then you get on an endgame raid, and you see what
they can't do.

    A lot of the endgame mobs are 100% magic resistant, so that they can't
be slowed. Seriously, I believe that is the ONLY reason for the 100% MR tag.
Well, that 100% MR stops a ton of other spells... like Lifetap. If a
necromancer can't get life back, and can't deal damage, and has a pet with
cruddy resists that gets smoked fast by any serious mob, what can they do?
Transfer mana to clerics, which CAN do something with it. Imagine being Mr.
Badass Tank for 50-some levels, then being told "oh, this mob won't aggro to
warriors, and has 10 K AC. But you can hold a mod rod for me for later!"

    It isn't that they don't know how to group. It's that they're facing a
mob that they can't land spells on. Casters without spells aren't so hot. In
the case of druids, they can buff (PotG is THE caster HP buff, much to my
cleric's chagrin), then cast Ro's to lower the mob's FR. Then heal ripostes,
as Sang once pointed out. Oh, and they port folks there. Not the most fun
one could have killing The Mother Of All Dragons.

    Well, that's sort of the point, isn't it? If you're running through EW,
say, and a Snow Griffin aggros you, what happens? Most other classes either
can get away, kill the griffin, or aren't detected by it in the first place.
You just take one for the team. 8( I'm not saying that is a legit
complaint - when things go south in Lower Guk, say, my warrior can
frequently be the only one with the HPs and MR to make it out - but it is
something people gripe about.

    What upgrades have you bought/camped so far from that list you made up?

    Other than the "boredom" part, as a 60 cleric I do see those as issues.
The inability to do anything to the mob only comes up during the endgame
encounters, though.

    That's almost true. In one place I've seen - Velk's - the pulls can be
so controlled, and the aggro so predictable, that a group with only a shaman
for heals in the spider areas would be more than fine. And the XP there
takes you to 60, sadly. But by and large, hell yes, it's a great perk.

    Not really. Most of a cleric's tools are for one purpose - damage
prevention/healing. Stuns don't do much damage, they prevent it. Roots are
used to either prevent damage (parking), or reduce it (using proximity aggro
to put a mob on the highest AC combattant). Heals, AC buffs... all for
prevention or restoration. Only our nukes actually speed kills, and they're
so inefficient that if a group really is pulling the mythical "constant
stream of blues" then you'll rapidly go OOM casting them. This was part of
Sang's point in the whole "why have a cleric for XP groups" thread - unlike
a SHM, a cleric never speeds the rate at which things are killed except by
reduction of downtime. And slows with small heals can reduce downtime by
about as much.

    It's another part of Velk's spiders that hurts clerics - they have such
weak damage output that stuns really aren't cost effctive, especially if the
mob is slowed first by a SHM/ENCH. My buddy that did 50-54 in a week there
nearly maxed his 1HB and Offense in spider camps because after slowing so
little healing was required. To become useful again he'd go to the edge of
the highest ledge (he usually got himself into Upper Spiders, the highest
camp), switch camera angles to see the bottom of Velk's, then stun something
at the bottom and train his own group.

    Aye, true. But when you remove their ability to do anything to a mob,
then they have two functions - buff, and Tash. And (if you're reading Brad,
take note) Buffing Isn't Fun.
