You keep referring to charm pets and mages as if it is the mage
who charmed the pet.  Did I miss mages receiving charm spells at
high level?  Or is it that a pet equipped/buffed by a high level
mage is so much more powerful than otherwise that it's become
normal to say it's "from" a mage to distinguish it from ordinary
mobs?
