Heh.  I just wish people would hunt in the Commonlands and Karanas again, or
the orc highway of Oasis of Marr.  Nowadays everyone's a twink alt getting
PLed by their main on the primary account. :)  One thing I do to keep the
game interesting with my necromancer is avoid LDoNs and PoP.  I've gotten
him to 54 with maybe one group of each.  I've had a great time going out an
actually exploring.

With my main, a 65 rogue, I try to get folks to go to old zones like Old
Sebilis and Howling Stones.  The zones aren't fantastic for experience, but
the loot is much better than PoP for the casual player (i.e., someone who
doesn't have 4-6 hours a night to raid).  Plus these zones don't require you
to be geared up with a multitude of goodies from the elemental planes.
