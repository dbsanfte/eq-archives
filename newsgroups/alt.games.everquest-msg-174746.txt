As in having a decent chance (depending on circumstances) vs. having no
chance.

I have noticed quite a drop-off in caster melee strength since the
caster AI patch.  In general, they don't melee as well and definitely
have a lot less hps then comparable melees (i.e. comparing Gnoll casters
to Gnoll melees, or Undead Frogluk casters to Undead Frogluk melees, &
etc.).  In the past, it always seemed as if the casters were equal to
(or at most very slightly inferior to) equivalent melees.  This may be
true of some mobs still, but in my recent experience casters have been
total creampuffs facing my Paladin (who can stun to interrupt), which
never used to be true.  As for "cast like mad", well that's certainly
still true.  And the lower level casters, like the ones the OP ran into,
seem never to run out of mana, they just don't seem to be able to use
their mana faster than that mad mana regen they get.
