Hi gang!
I play on Stromm.  Ever since the June 16 patch I can't zone into
Butcherblock - I get stuck between zones.  This is the only zone I can't get
into.

I went to customer service live chat and they said I should turn off my
firewall and antivirus software - I DON'T THINK SO!!!!  I tried it once and
it didn't work anyway.

At this point I think I have a corrupted file - anyone know which file it
may be?

Thanks in advance!
Lou
