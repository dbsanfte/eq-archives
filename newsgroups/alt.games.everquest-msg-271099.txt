"...it is not available anywhere close to that..."? I'm not sure how 
you're coming to that conclusion considering that:

* There are some 744 hours in this month - we're talking about 27 of them 
being lost.

* There are 31 days in this month - that's only 2 you've missed out on 
playing by your own admission.

Nowhere close to that? Stick to the facts and perhaps you wouldn't be so 
pissed off all the time.

You have options. Considering your level of dissatisfaction, I can't 
imagine why you're not exercising them. Do you just prefer to be angry?

And that has exactly what to do with their present day service levels? 
I'd say they're only known for their mistakes by those who choose to see 
little else.

I'm not sure what else to say that might help you understand just how 
much one can expect for $14.95/mo. Keeping in mind that we don't face a 
27-hour outage every month. In fact, we probably won't see it once every 
six months. Look at the big picture.
