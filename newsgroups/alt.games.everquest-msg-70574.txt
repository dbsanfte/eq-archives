The point isn't that EQ is expensive in and of itself. $10/month is a steady
thing, and something that doesn't change. $10/month is minor, as we've been
dealing with that for a year. $100+ dollars to upgrade my machine isn't
something that we can afford right now.

A game isn't. Friendships and socialization are. If you choose to deny that
these sorts of things exist in EQ, that's your choice. *shrug*

And for what it's worth, I was using my personal situation as an example of
how upgrading may not be an entirely viable option for everyone. Nearly
anyone could find $10 a month for something they enjoy. Not so many people
are going to find $100+ when their finances aren't the greatest in order to
keep doing that something when they've been given no reason to believe they
would have to shell out that extra money.

I think I just did. Until this point, anyway.

Get your own material, you fucking twit.
