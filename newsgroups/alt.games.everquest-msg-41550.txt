All snipped, answering subject line question.

As a tank, I have to rely on the help of a damage dealer to keep things moving.
I've worked with monks, wizards, pallies, necros, you name it. I also work, on a
nearly constant basis, with a rogue. Give me a skillful rogue any day. He
massively outdamages me constantly, makes for short fights, and manages aggro so
that he's not a mana sponge to the cleric.  For group activities, as I said, I'll
take the rogue hands down.
(disclaimer: a badly played rogue is, of course, just as sucky as a badly played
wizard, monk, etc.) But it's a VERY useful class. Particularly in the mid to
higher mid levels against mobs in excess of 5 to 8 KHP.
