Very few of them do. Just con each one you see before getting too
close. My main warning with Kardakor is, if you're tracking him, don't
dally around non-invis if you track him to a spot on the river outside
the caves between Thurg and the cave entrance and don't see him there.
This means he's underground, and WILL aggro through the ground if
you're KOS to him still...
