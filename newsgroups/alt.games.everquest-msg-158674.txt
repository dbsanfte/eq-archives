I'm curious, how many people are having problems logging in from the
UK at the moment?  Demon are having routeing problems over here which
may or may not have something to do with an arson attack on Telco
equipment in the Midlands.  It just seems like too much of a
coincidence that I'm having problems logging in while all this is
going on.
	Anyone sharing my difficulties who can get rid of my paranoia?
	Never thought that Osama would target EQ..
	Anyone think he sounds like a character from an Oz novel?
