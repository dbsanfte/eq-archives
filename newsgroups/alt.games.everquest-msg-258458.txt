A ranger has means to gate via tolans bp, any other melee has vials of
swirling smoke (insta gate, 1kpp), 10 dose gate potions (3kish for 10,
cheaper after that as you sell back one dose), thurgadin gate potion (100pp
if you buy the velium, free otherwise, need dorf faction or sneak).

I dont need a gate AA and dont want it, its a stupid addition unless it has
a 24 hour timer or something.
