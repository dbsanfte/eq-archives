Well stated.

Trying to read and figure out an ad nausem macro is annoying in the heat of
combat...as a War i make mine something like:

ATTACKING ... %T
/em assists ... %T
INCOMMING ... %T
etc.

To me the bold stands out among all the other babble (which the new damage
windows have greatly helped make combat speak more useful).

Make a funny one here and there to make the easy kills more interesting.
