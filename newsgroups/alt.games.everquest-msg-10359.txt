I did a quick check on allakhazam, and this diety you refer to doesn't seem to
appear anywhere in the Pantheon of Norrath.  Odds are that your prospective
guildmates will have a hard time locating any temples or getting any quests,
armor, items, etc. associated with this belief system.
  On the plus side, you're unlikely to fuck up your faction anywhere in Norrath.

Good luck!
