   "Locals call it Bear Mountain. This is because it was a _bare_ mountain,
not that it had a lot of bears on it.  It was about as bare as a mountain
could be. Most trees gave out halfway to the top, only a few pines hanging
on to give an effect like that of a couple of pathetic strands  teased
across his scalp by a baldie who won't own up.
  It was a place where Witches met. A fire gleamed on the very crest of the
hill. Dark figures moved in the flickering light, as the moon coasted across
a lacework of clouds. Finally, a tall, pointy hatted figure said,
 "You mean _everyone_ brought potato salad?"
 ~Terry Pratchett~
