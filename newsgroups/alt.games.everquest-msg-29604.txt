I may be a little out of touch on this one, but here goes....

First thing, fighting batons might have gotten cheap on your server, that's just
a possibility based on Povar's age.  The most I've seen them for was 500pp, if
you can get them for a couple of hundred, that would be worth it for something
that will serve you well unto the 40s (by then you'll be camping CoM for a Wu
stick).

Most Crescent armor may not be worth the aggravation, except, as I have been
told, the slippers.  Since in my 50 levels as a monk I've not looted one piece
of Crescent and I've not felt the loss, I may be out of touch there.

Something that surprised the hell out of me:  sometimes you can find Bamboo Bo
Sticks at the vendors in Cabilis for about 20pp and people selling them for
almost as cheap.

I realize many monks are poor almost entirely based on their inability to bring
home loot.  One method that helped me was employing my own lvl 14 iksar shaman
to drop spirit pouches in Cabilis for me to pick up before heading out.  Granted
this was not always possible, so good friends in a group who can hold your loot
can be a great boon.  Also, positioning other characters near your hunting
grounds who can assist you in supply drops/loot pickups.  Risky, but better than
dropping it all.

I hope this all helps,
