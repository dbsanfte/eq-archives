My husband had the Trader Problem last night he ALT+ ENTERED to check an
email he was expecting and it booted him out of trader.  My trader was
sitting right beside side his, and he did not move.

The only thing I can figure is it is a bug.  (perhaps random with XP)
because I have ME still ( I still play games that don't like XP LOL).  The
only problems I have is when I go to windowed mode I sometimes get an error
coming back in to full screen no matter which way I do it using the key
combination or the run windowed mode button in options.
