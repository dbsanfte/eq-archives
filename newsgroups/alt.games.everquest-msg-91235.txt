Outstanding idea!  Probably the best way to shake off the newbie blues is to
join a newbie/lowbie friendly guild.  Find a pal who's been around and stick
close, or just pay attention to guildchat ... you can learn a ton that way.

You're right, people tend to be more forgiving of their guildies than the
general population.  And if you play a class that's fairly group dependant
as they get into their early 20's (cleric, chanter, etc.), it's even better
for you.  I've seen folks in our guild hook up in their eraly teens and be
groupmates on into their 40's and 50's.

Congratulations!
