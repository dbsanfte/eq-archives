hehe I am so glad that I will never be considered to be this type of player.
If any-
thing my enchanter is TOO gung ho. I have been told by groups to SIT DOWN
AND SHUT UP (casting that is) because I always feel like my contributions
are
too few and far between. Sometimes I sit without casting for 2 - 3 pulls if
the group
is going well. Usually after a couple of reminders, I find that by sitting
there, the main
tank will feel pitty on me and over pull once in a while just so I can area
mez and
have a little fun doing traffic duty. hehehe gotta love those big lugs. I
found the best
way to handle exp sponges is to make a pull while they are afk and mez it
right in their
shorts. Then the group backs away and waits for the hilarity to ensue. When
they come
back we all claim we were chasing a runner and didnt see the wandering mob.
We
thought that the sponge was with us when we gave chase. nasty, yes.
meanspirited, sure.
effective, HELL YEAH!    god us chanters have a mean streak a mile wide!
hehehe
