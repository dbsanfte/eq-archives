Or you could try HHK, SK and PAW - good xp. but yes, Loio  is easy to find
groups and xp aint bad, just a shame so many idiots there hehe.

Unless you want to make some good money.

You'll be luck to get a group at 35 in DL imo.

And you will die very quickly. I took my chanter in there at 45 and my
mezzes were resisted quite often, with colour stuns being resisted ALOT! Was
workable, and having 2 healers at the time helped but if we'd pull a biggie,
I doubt I would have lived. I wont be going back there untill I'm atleast
48/49 for that reason alone.

And you can quite easily work your CC in DL itself with a good group. Quite
easy to pull big there.

cheers
