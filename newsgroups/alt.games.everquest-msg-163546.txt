You might find the ultrasecure lifestyle loses its appeal after a while.
It's possible to defeat mobs much faster than that with an Enchanter in
your teens, and presumably later as well (never played one past 17).  I
used to pull with Tash, maybe use Languid Pace on hard hitting mobs,
then DoT and watch pet health, nuke or step into the melee when needed
to prevent Goner from making his name into a prophecy (hate kiting can
work so long as the mob isn't faster than the pet, always figured what
I really needed was a Ranger/Druid/Necro/SK partner, there just isn't
any real substitute for snare).
