Though I know above I agreed with folks who encouraged you not to go
into tailoring if all you wanted was some specific item, if you're
looking for a trade skill, tailoring is a good one for a druid, for
two big reasons:

- Much of the materials you'll need will be dropped by various
critters. Your tracking skill will be very helpful in finding those
critters.

- The materials you'll need are scattered all around the world. The
ability to teleport will be a great help.

I recommend before you get into it, you make sure you've got an
ergonomic mouse and keyboard setup. Eventually you're going to make
several thousand heady kiolas, and you don't want any repetitive
motion injuries.
