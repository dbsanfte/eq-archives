All of these seem to be generic responses that would be appropriate
if FD didn't work without a fail message once or twice... but here
I'm citing a consistent "every time" versus "never" pattern.  A Cyclops
saw thru successful FD Every Time and A Giant Skeleton, Grizzly Bear,
and Lizardman Warrior Never.

The "very high level mobs" was most applicable, but here too I've
certainly seen her FD shake off much higher level mobs most of
the time, and these guys are really not all that high, some yellow to 59.
