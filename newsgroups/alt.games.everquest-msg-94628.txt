This is prity much how I play it.
If the port is valuable to the other player then it should be valuable
enough to recompence me in some way if they are dragging me off from
hunting.
If I am porting anyway I will /ooc Port to XX leaving in 5 mins from
XXX.
Peope are free to have a free port then if they want.

Like I said if players want me to stop playing to port them then I want
something back.
If I am porting anyway then the first 5 go for free.

Jim
