You know, I was tempted to see where else you posted, but decided that
would be nosy, so I searched only in alt.games.everquest.

Of course, now that you've let the cat out of the bag... :)

Newb!  Pre-patch you could get someone to pee on the floor or take a
messy shower, then using the cheat, move the water over under a broken
lightbulb, then get the repairman over to fix it and kill him with it.
From then on, whenever you called him, you'd get a GHOST REPAIRMAN!
Ooooooh....

But then they nerfed it, those bastards.

>Annie <--- Feels like Biz, now that she's being stalked via google!

Mua ha ha ha!  Soon I shall post your entire military career HERE!

Ryou
( - use a cheat to pick up someone reading. Put them on a toilet.  Now
they can't get up and will slowly die.
- kidnap a neighbor!  I have a house where the entire downstairs is
completely blocked off and has a lovely jail/slum theme, and the evil
witches who live upstairs trap people from the neighborhood and force
them to make cheap wallets for sale in the local supermarket.  Poor
Mrs. Newbie has no idea that wallet she bought for her husband's
birthday - where could he be? he's never been out all night before and
not called! - was made by his own two tortured little hands.)
