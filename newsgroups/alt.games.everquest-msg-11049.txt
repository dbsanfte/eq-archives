1.  They have explicitly said that they're not going to do that in
    existing zones, or if they ever do, it'll be on a case-by-case
    basis per zone.

2.  They know that a huge number of quests would become broken if
    they just implemented the Warrens-type loot rules across the
    existing zones.  Countless quests involve getting a No Drop
    item from a mob that is green to the person doing the quest.
