I have found these detail settings are reset to default every time the 
game detects different video hardware. I have a small LAN at home and 
regularly reinstall various versions of Windows on various computers, so 
I copy one version of Everquest to all PCs to save time on installing. 
Every time EQ loads up for the first time it resets these options.

You may have changed something in your video driver settings which have 
caused EQ to reset your game options.
