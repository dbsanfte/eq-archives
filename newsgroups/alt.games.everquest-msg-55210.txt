yeah it tricks you because I don't think they con as seeing invis, but
if you pause they jump you. There is a large difference to running at
high level with sow on and not getting jumped (invis or none) and
running at level 14 sow speed. If one thing hits you at 14 you could
get stunned then dead in like 2 more hits.
