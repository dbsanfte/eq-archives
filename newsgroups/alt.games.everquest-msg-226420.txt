If that is how they're doing it, that change might actually be more
useful than just a 4% drop in average damage. What they seem to be
doing is smoothing out the damage curve for warriors, taking away the
higher damage spikes which makes timing heals a lot simpler. 

I don't think it's enough of a fix for warriors but it's better than I
thought when I first read about a 4% damage reduction.
