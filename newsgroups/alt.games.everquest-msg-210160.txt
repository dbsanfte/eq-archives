For straight pp soloing I would probably try plane of innovation or plane of
justice. In either case looking for sellables and trade skill supplies for
pop trade skill items. Both zones have solid 149 hitters to dire charm that
have good atk ac and hps . Both zones have steady plentifull mobs that drop
high value items.

In plane of innovation watch out for a mob called archaic. It is there just
to make life hell for what you are doing . It is immune to slow, root , and
snare . With a dire charm pet though the druid can keep up with heals just
healing the pet till it dies. Try to get as your first high level spell
insanity and a ornate silk glove pattern wouldnt hurt, with those the
chanter becomes a fairly decent nuker which will speed things up and
increase exp gain.

The best place to hunt in plane of justice is deep in . When you decide to
try and hunt there download a good map and study it first. The area near
mavin is not bad for hunting.
