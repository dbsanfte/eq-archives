Of course.  That is the point.  Some things would be ridiculous
without a tracker.  (Finding haze panthers or hunters/foragers)  Other
things would just take an extra hour or two to do, and probably the
help of several more people.  But let me put it this way.  If there
were no such thing as tracking, a lot fewer people would even bother
doing certain tasks.  There would be almost no gnomish vanishing
devices in the game at all.  Is a tracker crucial to being able to
make a gnomish vanishing device?  I would say so.
