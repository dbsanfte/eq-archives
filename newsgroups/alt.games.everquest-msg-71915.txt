Subject: What are the new shops in FP?

One of the previous patches added new shops to East and North Freeport, but
what are they, and where are they? So far, I've only found one; the building in
North FP near the bank that has the oven outside is now a fletching shop (with
kits, but no actual arrows, just the nocks, shafts, etc, to make them).

Hoping they added a shop that sells shields, too.....
