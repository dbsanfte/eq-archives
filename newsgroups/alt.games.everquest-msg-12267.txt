    If all you knew is a new spell was put in that enchants clay, the first
place I'd check is the trade skill that uses clay for everything - Pottery.
If you knew nothing about any trade skills, then you're gonna have a hard
search in front of you anyways.

    As message boards go, EQTraders is pretty clean. The moderator locks
down and redirects a TON of threads to keep discussion in one place. After
every patch where a class of items is introduced, a thread will be created -
"New Class Of Items - STATS ONLY PLEASE", where all non-stats posts will be
deleted. Really, that board is responsible for fixing a TON of broken items,
for forcing Verant to really improve the trade skills, and for the high
level of general knowledge about trade skills out there now.

    Some of them are quite good, although your ENCH should be aware they're
deity-specific. They also triv above 250 - the first pottery item to do so
(the old pottery max trivial was 188). As a jeweler, you can appreciate how
many times your friend will fail a 250 plus triv item at 188 skill. He'll
also need vials of clear mana (the level 29 spell) from you for them, too.
