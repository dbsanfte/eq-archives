  According to http://eq.castersrealm.com, he is right, they do have the
same duration (27 minutes), at least for the level 29 haste buff
(Augmentation).  I'm not sure if it's entirely accurate, but there you have
it.

  Still, his comment that it'll make melee characters generate 50% or more
damage seem a bit generous, at least for a mid-level enchanter.
Augmentation can only increase attack rate by 22-30% (again according to
castersrealm)... and it's my understanding that it only increases the attack
rate for normal weapon attacks, and not special attacks like kick, bash,
backstab or the special monk attacks... so there doesn't seem to be any way
it can be boosting melee damage output by more than 25% or so at that level.
Still, 20-25% is a significant boost, and there's also the agility/AC
buffing component of the spell that has to be considered.

  I agree with you that the wisest way for a 29ish enchanter to buff a group
would probably be to first give the casters/buffers their Clarity
(especially if they are low on mana for whatever reason), and then cast
Augmentation right before the first pull, or right after the first fight
begins and possibly wait until the second fight to give the spell to the
next melee class so it staggers (if that's really necessary).
