   If you ask me, the very nature of this little diversion misuses the
word "game".

   Really, a game that directs it's members to get recruits, by
trickery or whatever means?  Oh, they might have some little oft
ignored rule so they can disclaim that this is their intent.  But the
effect is that I see posts like this, worded almost always _exactly_
like this, on several newsgroups and ezboards.  Sound like fun to me
the same way that Amway sounds like a fun shopping excursion.  Maybe
the game _is_ fun.  Maybe it's a hoot.  But the bad name it is
generating for itself by these little stunts will give it a rep that
will sink it faster than a lead lined cement boot.
