I have to agree with this. I've gotten to the stage that if I hear "I
have to go get KEI", then my reply is "bummer, I have to log....".

I don't mind whoever having it, but I strongly object to the lack of
strategy that seems to universally accompany it. So much so, that it is
usually very rapidly lost, then the whole group has major down time
while they zip off to get Kei again.

Only a few people who have it use it wisely.
