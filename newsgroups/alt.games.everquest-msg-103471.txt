Thats fair enough, and indeed then druid is doing the healing I try and
spare them sow. In my case im playing enchanter, and the answer to where in
going is "round and round until someone snares the damn thing or can agro
it". Another situation I want to be sowed is hunting in a group at the giant
fort in fm. Overpulls and having to zone are just too common there to not
have sow.
