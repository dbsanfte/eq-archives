So lets assume you are a grandmaster tailor of skill 250. I can make you the
Artizans Seal with my JC and Pottery skill and give you the Artizans seal.
You take the seal and put it in a sewing kit with needle and combine using
your tailoring skill and bingo, you have your trophy.

Geerlocks are tinkered by gnomes, they can make them for all tradeskills,
they equip in your primary slot and give a +5% modification to your skill.
i.e Tailoring skill 240 becomes skill 252 (250 cap) which lessens your
chance of failure
