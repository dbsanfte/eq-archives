Well I certainly had fun buzzing about Steel Canyon.   Well until I
heard that sudden sort of groan sound that means you're out of
endurance.   The plummet to earth wasn't a whole lot of fun. :)

I've heard about the increase, but even if it never boosted at all it
would be fine -it's so much faster than hover it's a real chore now
hovering on lower level and new characters.

Now, if I could only have wings.

Though actually what i'd like to see in the future would be several
hover/flying options that you could choose between.  The standard
"levitate by will" that's in the game now, wings, rocket boots, and the
ever popular rocket backpack.

So a mutant or mage might go for wings, while tech/sci/natural might go
for the boots or backpack.  Or any of them could go with the current
standard.

Be pretty damn neat to see different people flying by different means.
