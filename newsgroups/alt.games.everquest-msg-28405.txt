I disagree. Let them make their money the same way everyone else does. A
system that is similar to Diablo 2 would work well for Everquest I think You
would still have to travel around the 1st time to activate the portals, and
you would only be allowed teleport to other portals you had activated.
 With the current system, I may still have to spend a lot of time trying to
find someone to port me even if I have the cash to pay for it.
