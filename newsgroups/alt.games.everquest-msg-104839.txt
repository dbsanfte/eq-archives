Another item from my wishlist implemented. About time. won't help the 20 or
so quests I screwed up so far but should help most newbies. Great change.
Heh at this rate I figure this game will be perfect in about 2 more years. hehehe

This item just kills me. For what is required to get it, its not that great for either
wizards
or druids much better choices out there. I wonder if the changed the stats and made it
useful?
I wonder if there are any wizards out there actually using it?

> - Rod of Identification should be working now

OMG! /em feints dead away!
I sent in a bug report and a petition about that like 3 years ago.
Holy smoke I think I might still have that on a mule somewhere.

I hope it was the Grimling caves. There were a couple very bad spots in them.

Hmmm, too much fear kiting going on there?

Cool. That is where I do most of my tradeskilling. Good for me. =)

Interesting update to Misty Thicket. Neat to see changes to old
zones like this.
