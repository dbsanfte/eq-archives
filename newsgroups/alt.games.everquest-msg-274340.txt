I'd say it would be the term they chose.  "Hooters," while rather tacky, 
isn't patently vulgar or obscene.  It's eye-roll material at best.  Cocks, 
dicks, schlongs are more vulgar, along the line of cunt or pussy.  Now, had 
they done a "sausages" shirt, or all worn Big Johnson shirts, that would be 
more along the lines.
