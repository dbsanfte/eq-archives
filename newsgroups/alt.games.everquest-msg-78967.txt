Hello all...

While frantically wailing away on spiders in East Karana, I stumbled into
the Bandit camp there. I managed to live through the initial fight with the
aid of a pair of passing wolves. They actually ran interference for me!

I did kill and loot a named bandit, and looted a Staff Segment and a
Highpass Hold key. Anyone know what quest this is for?

Thanks!
