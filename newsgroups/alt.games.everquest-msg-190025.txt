Difference between weapon skills and offense skill raises is that (I'm
pretty sure) you have to make contact to get a weapon skill raise, while
you just have to swing to get an offense skill raise.  At least I've
noticed offense raises on missed swings while the same is not true of
weapon skill raises. 

If they were taken to a sufficiently difficult zone for the level (ie:
they were plvl'd too aggressively compared to, say, Martin's assling),
it's possible that they just didn't make enough contact with their
weapon to get the skillups.  With sufficient tash/malo applied to a mob,
they may have been able to land nukes after a certain level which would
probably be more consistent than trying to hit something with a 1hb
skill of 5 after reaching a certain level of mob.
