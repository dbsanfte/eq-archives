Qeynos area (your level)

-Aquaducts in Qeynos
-Island between Erudin and Qeynos


Whenever you feel to make the journey to East Commonlands (EC) go for it.
You are a decent level to hunt Orcs there (for further exp) and then move on
to NRO to kill some dervs.

Once you hit, 24ish I suppose, head to East Karana.  Be careful of the
griffins/griffons/griffeines there though.  There are a good number of
spiders in EK for silks.

When in EK be on the lookout for named Cyclops, Giants (Turbal Earthstrider
specifically, he's a nasty one at your level) and named Gnolls.  Have Cure
Poison, Spirit of Cheetah and/or Gate memorized of course, incase you do get
to meet face to face with any of those nasties.
