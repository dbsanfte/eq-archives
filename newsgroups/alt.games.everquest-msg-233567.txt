There's more to it than stats.

There are exp penalties and special abilities and (less important now) 
faction considerations.

Example: Iksar monks get better regen, and innate forage. They get slightly 
better (for a monk) stats. They also get a 25% exp penalty.

Example 2: Troll warriors get regen. Ogre warriors get immunity to melee 
stuns from the front arc.
