I think the biggest question is what tier scrolls are being sold for
3sp?  Tier one, which includes Smite can be crafted by a single
artisan, so they should be pretty inexpensive.  If you harvest all of
the ingrediants yourself, total out of pocket expense for a tier 1
spell is well under 1sp.  Once you jump to tier 2, you have to buy the
quill and paper from someone else (or make an alt to supply them) so
expect the price for the finished product to be higher.
