HP is also useful for a cleric, battle cleric or no battle cleric. Clerics
get beaten on sometimes, and the more HP you have the better your chances
of surviving the experience (and ergo the party surviving the experience).

More WIS is always a good thing, but there is a point where extra STA is
more useful than extra WIS.

Another way to look at it is that WIS affects only the size of your mana
pool, not of mana regen. In an XP group, mana should stay about the same,
so size of mana pool is less important. In a raid, you're burning mana more
quickly, so the size of the mana pool is more important; on the other hand,
there are more likely to be AE effects that will take down a low-HP cleric.

So even for a min/maxer there are arguments either way. :-)

Personally I tend to go for WIS, mainly, and depend on DA to keep me
alive, but I die frequently enough to be aware of the advantages of high
HP and AC. (Neither of which I particularly have.)
