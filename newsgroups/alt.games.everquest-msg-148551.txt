Bards are very powerful in PvP combat. Wizards are also powerful
and have that awesome amount of burst damage. And a mage with
and epic pet is a force. A lot of it depends on the player, also on the
area they are fighting in, if its in a small room then you take a lot of
the advantage away from the casters and players with SoW and the
bards.

But usually casting classes pretty much own the melee classes in
PvP. Although I did see a very good rogue player in PvP combat
that owned every caster he came against in an arena contest.
Some of them never landed a spell on him, it was awesome to
watch.
