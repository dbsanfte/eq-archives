Yes, it can be multiquested; I got everything but the rune from Neriak with my
druid and let my chanter hand in the Neriak rune to get the mask. The runes and
glowing mask are all no drop; but the incandescent mask itself is not. It is,
however, entirely possible to get the Neriak rune even if you are KOS in Neriak.
The guy who sells it is on beta neutral faction (same as the sellers at the
druid rings) and nothing will attack you while you are getting it, as long as
you can make it in. My lvl 8 high elf has been there looking just like herself
to purchase enchant silver from the same guy. Invis to get in, drop invis to get
the rune (or enchant metal spell), then gate out and all will be fine. Of course
if you can't invis or sneak/hide, you might have a problem. . .
