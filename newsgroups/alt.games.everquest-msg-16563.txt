Hey, we're about the same game-age then. In that two weeks I have gotten to 
level ten and my laughter at the EverCrack-eats-your-life jokes has gotten 
a bit hollow. :)

A lot of newbies now (moreso, I imagine, than a year ago) are the you-
should-give-me-stuff type. A few of us understand the hard work that goes 
into getting that cool book and those nifty earrings- that fraction of us 
is not as blatantly unrefined as "someone sow me some one sow me" or "D3wd 
3y3 n33d l3wtZ! g1v3 2 m3 or 1 w1ll h@xx0r j00!". We see the stuff we want 
and think "Can't wait until I get there". 

Admittedly, I don't turn down charity or a good deal- it would be bad RP if 
I did[1]. But, at the same time, I try to keep it flowing downhill. When I 
upgrade a piece of armor, I see if I can find someone to give the old stuff 
to.

I think EQ is a representation of the world, with the only difference being 
that the 12 year old hair-pullin' brats are equal (in EQ's game-rules 
society) to 25 year old adults.

Just my .02GP

[1] Fairness aside, would *you* turn down kickass armor if every orc you 
say brought you to Bind Wind time?
