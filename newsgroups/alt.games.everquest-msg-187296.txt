I've never petitioned a name, and I probably wouldn't unless it was
extremely offensive, even with all the legolas wanabees.  Mainly because
I have had tons of other problems such as lost items (some I never got
back) boddies in walls, being ported into the lava on zonning, etc.  And
getting ahold of a GM is so freeking hard, I don't care to waste my or
their time on names, which don't hurt me or anyone else in least.  It
just seems so stupid.  If you are just a mean person and want to hurt
the person with a name, I suggest you go to the red servers where you
can grief people and it's expected.

On the other hand I'd consider petitioning someone with an obscene or
offensive name, considering the number of children who play the game. 
And the afformentioned "Eat..." would get it right away.
