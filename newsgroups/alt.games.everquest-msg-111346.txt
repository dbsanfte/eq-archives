And you can stop your story right there. Totally different situation. He
was the one in the /auc channel with a "Want to *BUY*" and you
responded. The person with the item is the only one who can eventually
set, determine, agree to the final price the item will be sold for.
Since you had one to sell, IMO, you could have just responded with /tell
buyer_01 'I have one of those and you can have it for 150 PP'.  Or... if
you were already convinced he was low level and needed a break, you
could have said 75 PP. If you didn't like the tone of his answer, charge
full price or tell him to forget it.  In either event, responding to a
/WTB is VERY different than the morons with various items to sell who
sit in the auction zone all day doing the /auc WTS x, y, and z  and
refuse to name prices.
