Well, I have to admit that it is encouraging to hear about a high level
crew that plays for fun.  I do actually know some lo- and mid-50s folks
on Tunare who are great fun to be around, just don't ever seem to get an
opportunity to run with them.  Of course I haven't tried too all that
hard to hang out with them, given that my level and gear are so inferior
to theirs.  Not to mention the fact that my paladin is developing quite
an inferiority complex about his melee capabilities.  As far as I can
tell at this point in his career the greatest contribution to a group in
a really tough fight would be to try and make sure he's the first melee
to go down, so that the guys who actually hurt the mob(s) get to swing
longer.  hmm, enough already, all the paladin complaints have been done
to death.
