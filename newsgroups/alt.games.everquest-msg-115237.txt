Halflings/Hobbits are not a "convenient stereotype". They are a
character that has been woven into high fantasy. EQ is a game based on
high fantasy. You are trying to pidgeon-hole Halflings into a
"convenient stereotype" of your own making. All other Druid/Warrior
races in EQ have Rangers, but you cannot accept Halflings? They may be
late to the part, but they are NOT contrary to the world of EQ.

Your interpretation. "Halflings" are used throughout the D&D world as
well. Yes, the designers of EQ chose to make them look "Tolkeinesk",
but that is about as far as it goes.

But none...zero...nadda professional thiefs. A few bad eggs in a
farming community does not equate to Tolken Hobbits having a Rogue
class.

"completely unlike EQ"

EQ Halflings != Tolkein Hobbits by your own admission.

There is no mention of religion or any reference to a Hobbit "priest"
class in Tolkein's work. In fact there is very little reference to
organized religion at all for any of the races.

"Middle-Earth was a low-magic setting"

Even if they had a priest class, they would have not been casters of
spells.....EQ Halfling != Tolkein Hobbit

I will grant you a Tolkein Warrior Hobbit, but as noted above the EQ
Halfling deviates completely when it comes to the ability to use
magic, and the ingame lore associated with the race.

All of the races/classes are "stolen" and "rip-offs" from
high-fantasy. There isn't a single original thing in EQ. All of EQ is
"ripped-off" from high-fantasy content, and most (if not all) of that
content is bastardized and changed for use in EQ. My pointing out that
EQ has stolen and bastardized content from the genre is not a
"cop-out", it is a fact. EQ is it's own world, and can makes it's own
rules. 

So why do you insist on picking on Halfling's getting to be Rangers? 
Why do you have such an illogical and unreasoning dislike for
"Halfling Rangers". Are you hung up on the stats and exp bonus? Do you
have race/class envy?
