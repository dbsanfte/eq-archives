I wonder if it isn't possible to script the whole thing and truly have
an "Automatic Buffing System".  Actually, I'm sure it's possible.  What
I wonder is whether it's easy enough to do that it's being done (seems
to me that most people clever enough to do something difficult would
find better things to do with their time).
