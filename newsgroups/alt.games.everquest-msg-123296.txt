Hiya all, I played EQ for about 3 months when it first hit the shelves, way
back when. Had a GREAT time, was easy to find people to group with, ventured
out to places I should not have been :) and lots of other fun. Thing is, in
that 3 months I don't think I knew the most strategic tatics .. and, lost
interest when, after 3 months my Ranger was only at level 12 or 13 .. can't
exactly remember .. Now, I didn't play hours, and hours, and hours every
day, had to work and take care of family. But, I did have a couple of hours
each evening.
So, got a few questions, I'm thinking about picking up the game again and
checking out the new add-on places I've seen.

What are some good sites for reading up on good practices for leveling
quicker. I'd like to try my hand at being a Mage or something with good
spell casting. But, I don't want to spend 3 months and basically have no
better spells than I started off with !

What are some of the better servers for US Eastern Time Zone people .. or
does that matter ?

How bout a good site to help with a starting Mage ? Like .. best race (is
that the right word ?) and starting abilities ?

Since EQ has been out for so long and there are lots and lots of people and
groups now .. is it hard for a newbie to get into the game and find some
groups to fight with when I get bored of soloing ? Most of the time I see
myself soloing just because I don't play for hours on end (unless it's the
weekend) .. but, there are times I like to group and make friends. I
remember when I played it was pretty simple to just yell out I was looking
for a group and within minutes we were well on our way. How bout now ? Has
it gone beyond that easy "friendship" that it used to be ?

Anyhow .. just looking for some good newbie pointers and starters for
someone wanting to be a Mage.  I'll be starting with nothing .. from scratch
.. and just want to know the best way to go about it this time so hopefully
I can get the most fun out of it !
Thanks !
