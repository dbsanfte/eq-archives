So which server has 3,000 concurrent users at PEAK times, let alone on
server up?

Sorry but thats a bull excuse.

And for the general "stop whining about patches" reply that everybody
uses... I don't really think its valid this time.

The bugs were SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HUGE AND GLARING, this time VI well and
truly fucked up.  Not small inexcusable mistakes, but HUGE fucking bloopers.

There is no justification for problems of that magnitude being released onto
live servers.  Shit like that should never even make a beta or test server.

Lets see, 90%? of the game crashing when you zone, camp, die..

An updated patch that caused everybody I spoke to (including myself) to
crash the instant they pressed a key at the character select screen

Tls to bind, and decessions out of nowhere.  Random punches for 20k...
falling through walls and floors on a regular basis.. porting into the Emp
room and 20king in the basement (just one example of a zone with bug, it
sure as hell wasn't the only one)

The patch was a disaster, and I think it really hurt whatever credibility
Sony/VI has as competent programmers/testers/everything else involved in the
process.
