Actually, the virus companies didn't raise badtrans from low risk to high
risk because of stupid people running attachments (although computer newbies
and illiterates did run the attachment I'm sure).  The reason it propagated
so quickly was a bug in some versions of outlook and outlook express.
Outlook would, under certain circumstances, AUTOMATICALLY run any executable
attachments, regardless of security settings, when the message was
previewed.  If you clicked on the message to delete it, the executable was
run.  Badtrans explicitly, through bad mime headers, took advantage of this
vulnerability.

There is a patch at MS to fix this.  I only have outlook on one of the PCs
on my network and it has the patch applied. I may start filtering
attachments at the mail server.  That would be overkill if I could trust the
software not to do things without my permission.
