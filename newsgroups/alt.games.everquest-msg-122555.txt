    But you should have been, since the snake casters have been cheating
since the place was first released. =) Even prior to the patch, every so
often a puller would come back with Splurt, Pyrocuror, Bane of Nife and Pox
of Bertox all nicely stacked on them. The only change seems to be now some
mobs will root, too - guess they want the efficiency of root-DoT'ing. "Med
up, A_Shissar_Spirit_Destroyer. These 'puller' things spawn fast, and in
groups."
