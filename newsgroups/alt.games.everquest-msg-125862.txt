If you are rooted by a ghoul you are being beat on (OP's example, tho 
for some reason he speaks of the ghoul casting "grasping roots", I
haven't met any ghouldruids yet myself, sounds unpleasant).  Ghoulroot
is a proc-type combat effect, not a ranged spell, which makes Jazz's
commentary relevant.

I have never had a single instance of success with the "first slot
open" tactic, and until this thread I've never seen any reason to
go back and deliberately test it again.  I've got a mid-level paladin
not far from LGuk, should have time to play tonight so I'll send him
in to get rooted a few times and see how things work out.
