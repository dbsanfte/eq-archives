Most likely it would go into your desktop two cable connections, a possible
jumper change on the harddrive,  some screws to hold it in place, and you
should be set.  I have to admit that my knowledge of things laptop is pretty
vague, I am assuming that they use IDE drives in the laptops just like in
the desktops, albeit possibly very compact ones.  Even if it can't be
installed permanently in your desktop, it can likely be plugged in
temporarily to copy stuff off of it.  I am reasonably certain that in a new
desktop you have room for it, unless you already have four IDE devices
hooked up which is unlikely.
