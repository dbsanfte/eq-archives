Yeah, it is a simple video game and some of the critics have assailed it as 
"Pacman that will kill you". They deride the icon matching system as cheap 
interactivity and it is, until you consider that matching icons is really 
much of what you do in combat, too. You see a pop, you hit a button; mob 
shifts to attack the cleric, you hit a button; mobs brings the MT's health 
down dangerously low, you hit a button; you get aggro, you hit a button. And 
so on. Not sure there's any substantive difference here. As in combat, you 
can use buffs to increase your resources and enhance your chances, you can 
use different timing tactics to achieve different quality states of 
interest, you can make a long term strategic plan on certain pristines that 
you will achieve and save, and so on.

Not to diminish anyone's heartfelt opinions that this system isnt any good, 
but I honestly believe that a lot of the criticism directed at it is based 
on it being so radically different from any prior crafting system.
