This is what has me glowering at SWG dubiously.

Back when I was cruising the dev boards, it sounded like a lot of
effort was going into setting up an interesting and dynamic PVP
system, and a not-so-fun niche for PVEers to play lightsaber repairmen
and landspeeder mechanics. 

Where EQ was a PVE game with PVP tacked on as an afterthought, I fear
SWG will be a PVP game with PVE tacked on as an afterthought.

If UO taught me nothing else, it taught me that I hate PVP.  (Yes, I
hated it in DAOC too.)
