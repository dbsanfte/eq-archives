I have killed both Trillcor and Fireclaw and they seem to vary quite a bit
in how tough they are.  Sometimes they have been a piece of cake, and
sometimes they really worked me over before I killed them.  The problem with
pulling them is that if you don't pull them before their buddies spawn, they
will always bring someone with them.  Also, if you try to pull the buddies
one at a time to kill them first, Trill or Fire will come too.  Trillcor
hits with a stun that spins you around for several seconds (very annoying).
I think anyone at 50th level can handle themselves here, just a warning to
be careful around these two named MOBS, don't assume because the rest of the
room in a cake walk that they will be too.

Also, be careful of the Stonegrabber that spawns as a pile of rocks.  I
backed into him one time when I was fighting another MOB and he caused a
little trouble for me (they are highly magic resistant).

If you clear the room and get bored, you can go down the hall, or around the
corner for more action.  It's all about the same combination of Grabbers,
Underbulks and Fiends.  I was picking up half a yellow in about 30 minutes
soloing in here, even with half the spawn LB.
