I am also using ICS at home. It is working fine, except the ocasional
disconnections while zoning. I tried to configure Wingate to play EQ from
the other computer but failed. Patch is ok, that is only a TCP mapping to
the patch server. But playing is only through UDP. How do you configure
Wingate to allow UDP traffic from the other computer ? I know you can make
UDP mappings too .. but not for port ranges. And EQ needs ports 1024+
opened. Care to share with us what you did ? :)

Of course, I assumed you used Wingate to play EQ ...
