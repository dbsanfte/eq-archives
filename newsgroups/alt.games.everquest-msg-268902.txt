From Moorgard, on the official forums:

"Our designers are currently refining a few elements of the guild
system. Chief among the upcoming changes is the fact that decay over
time is going away; we will tune guild advancement rates to take this
change into account. Additionally, status quests will be based on the
player level rather than the guild level, which means you won't need
to farm greys to advance your guild. Also, artisans will be able to
earn status by performing tasks similar to the ones they now perform
for their societies. This will allow artisans to become active and
valuable patrons for their guild.

We believe these changes will benefit all types of guilds, from casual
players to dedicated raiders.

I can't yet announce when these changes will go live, as we want to
spend a good deal of time testing them internally before pushing them
to the live servers. But I wanted to let you all know what was coming
in the near future."
