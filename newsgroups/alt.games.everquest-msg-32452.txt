    Only when instituted by a or as a form of government.  Communisim
without socialism is possible providing that the community desires it... but
of course you knew that as demonstrated by the end of your post.

    Perhaps.  But that really only applies to people who know what communism
is, and don't want it.  My point was that most newsgroup posters don't have
a clue what the word communism means. (Actually my specific point was TC
doesn't know what it means.)
    I just received a Cold War Service Recognition a few weeks ago... and I
was not around for McCarthy.  I would suggest that the evils of the nations
which are identified as communist are a bit more contemporary than newsgroup
posters' grandparents.

    As I said above... communism and communist government are two very
different things... and truthfully, neither has anything to do with
infringement of civil or constitutional rights (except that the two biggest
"communist" nations allow[ed] no civil rights for their citizens... but
again, that had nothing to do with them being communist, and everything to
do with them being imperialistic and socialist [and even then, their
particular flavor of socialism]).
