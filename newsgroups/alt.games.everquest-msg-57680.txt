Actually, I thought after I started making my journey that I should have
asked someone to group with me to see how I would have been tracking
relative to them (i.e. using the info from the guy I asked, in theory I
would have been running right beside him but according to my PC, I would be
zoning while he was still in the middle of the zone) but I was afraid I
would just either crash them or me.  But this would have been an interesting
trial which might have got to your last point - - didn't feel like doing it
though once I reached my destination as, yes, I was worried someone wouldn't
take too kindly to my little test even though I have no idea how it
happened. (trust me, I'm about as PC literate as a fig these days.)
