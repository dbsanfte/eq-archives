    This is a MMORPG. That's always the case.

    No, and since I never used the word "solo", I regard this as something
of a straw man. I raid to increase my character's ability to defeat
challenges in the game world. I take whatever path leads to that goal the
fastest. Things like seeing the world and discovering are secondary to that
goal - I did levels 40 to 60 in 5 zones total, and two of those zones were
used only for one level.

    If you'd been on a raid, you'd know this is the case.

    Correct. There's plenty of mobs in the world that are quite tough which
drop nothing. We don't kill them.

    It is a means to further our ability to become even more powerful
relative to our environment in a minimum of time. You may not get raid drops
as often as you get single group drops, but they boost you up by far more.

    Again, I don't know where you're getting soloing from. But I will say
this: raiding does not yield good experience rewards. Experience, in the
form of levels and AA's, improve a character. A character with good gear
generally gains XP faster than a character with poor gear. So by gaining
boosts in power from items in an optimal manner, we're also allowing
ourselves to gain XP in an optimal manner during our non-raid time.

    Ah, there's where soloing comes in - it ties up your straw man
arguement. See above - my motivation is not to experience the joy of
soloing. It is the accumulation of power relative to the environment in an
optimal manner. Raiding is merely the means to that goal - if another method
would allow me faster progress, I'd dump raiding and do that. And so would
my guild.
