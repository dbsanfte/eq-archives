Well, yes and no.  I'll try to be brief... (especially since this was a
touchy subject in the guild I recently ended up leaving)

It's not really a matter of raiding, it's a matter of exp grouping.   Due to
the level bonuses, and the reduced "blue range" 60 plus, there are only
about 3 spots left in the game where a 63+ group can go and group with some
high 50's people, and still have everyone getting "good" experience.(not
even great, merely "good")   Valor and Storms are the minimum flags that
need to be had, to continue getting "great" experience all the way to 65,
and beyond.

For some guilds this isn't an issue.  Everyone does the trials in Justice,
with a few extra runs so the groups doing it can be balanced.   For ours it
was.   We had a *lot* of high 50's and barely 60 characters that became that
level not because they played as much... but because they had been playing
casually for three years or more.  What happened was the heavy players like
myself zoomed up to 63, 64 and 65 right away, and needed to move on.   Most
of the rest did not.   So we ended up with a guild that was half "average
level 64", and half "average level 58"

In order to become flagged for the "good exp" zones, Valor and Storms (Yes,
I know, there are better beyond, but these are the two most attainable)  you
need to pass one of the Trials in Plane of Justice.    The Trials themselves
are *extremely* hard.   They are designed for average players of level 63.
It takes a very well equipped group to do them earlier.

Your question then becomes "Why did those of us who rushed to 65 not get all
the rest flagged?"

Yes, it is concievably possible to do this.   But it doesn't happen.

1) It puts a *lot* of pressure on a very few individuals.    It takes a
*very* good group of 5 level 65's (barring uber equipment, which we didn't
really have) to powerlevel a person who cannot contribute to the group past
the trials.  (and make no mistake, if you're not at least 60 (or maybe 60
plus), you're more of a liability than an asset in that trial room.)   In a
guild with over 30 players that would need help...  and an average wait to
do the trials of 30 minutes between attempts... couple attempts per
person...) you're talking weeks of play time, maybe even a month, to
powerlevel everyone thorugh.   A month, of doing nothing but sitting in that
trial room, trying to get one person after another flagged, with little
thanks afterwards.  Tell me those 5 people getting asked to PL everyone else
through aren't going to get just a *bit* burned out.

2)  You're getting people flagged for zones where they are *way* over thier
heads.   Take the desert giants in Plane of Storms, for example... one of my
current favorite exp spots.   The giants are level 62 - 63.   They can
triple hit for up to 720 damage each round.   And each of those hits can
have a damage proc attached to it, which adds up to 850 more damage per
proc.   If you powerleveled a 58 warrior through the trials, no way in hell
he would be able to tank that.  He wouldn't even be able to taunt the thing
on to him, (must be level 60 to taunt yellow or above) and if he did gain
aggro somehow, it would kill him in seconds.   (and not all were 58.   One
of the biggest complainers was a perpetually level 54 paladin, and I'm sure
it was just a bit of time before a vocal level 50 warrior spoke up to remind
the guild what it "owed" her this time.)

None of the people you powerleveled through the trials would be able to get
a group in those zones, nor would a low level group of thier own be able to
survive.  In order for them to be able to hunt there, you would have to take
them into your more powerful groups again, and powerlevel them more.   An
ongoing charity case, with no end in sight.

Then of course, there were the (perhaps) inevitable arguements about it.
The lower level group accused the upper level group of being selfish and
unhelpful for not wanting to powerlevel them through it.   One even went so
far as to suggest that we were all secretly laughing at her, since we were
getting incredible experience while she was "stuck" in the older zones, and
plotting to keep her there for our continued amusement....  well, lets just
say it went downhill from there.   The constant badgering, whining and
complaining made the higher levels less inclined to spend thier whole night
helping those who were acting like that...  which induced more complaining,
message board flaming, etc..
