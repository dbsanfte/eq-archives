Certainly did.

E-mailed a copy of dbg.txt and msinfo.ifo, as well as a detailed
description of the problem, the pertinate lines from dbg.txt and a
synopsis of system specs.

I got back a autoresponse of the Luclin troubleshooting page, which I'd
already read a dozen times and told me nothing I didn't already know.

Can only hope they do actually read the emails and not leave them in
autoresponse purgatory
