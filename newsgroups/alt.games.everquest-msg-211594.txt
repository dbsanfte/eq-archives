Actually, the same goes for masturbation, since the act Onan committed in
Genesis 38:9 wasn't really masturbation.  It was pulling out before he came.
I suppose maybe he finished off with his hand...but it's not usually
considered masturbation when you use a woman to get all the way to the point
of orgasm.

If anyone should be worried about Genesis 38:9, it is male porn stars. :-)
