One of the few destinations left where I'd be willing to pay for a port 
was Cobalt Scar.  GD EW KD WL SS CS is a long long run, and depending on 
your invis and KOS status (and level) could be a dangerous one as well.

However, I've been playing around with POM recently, and had a group 
mate accidentally discover something; he went out to pull and ended up 
in Cobalt Scar.

After some exploration the next day, we managed to find out what he'd 
done; there's a tree just north of the zone in, indistinquishable 
visibly as far as I can tell from all the other trees, but if you click 
on it while close to it, you port into the center of CS, underwater, but 
with no aggro nearby unless perhaps you are so unlucky as to land atop 
the sea dragon.  (very rarely up, this would be like dropping in on 
Wuoshi in WL)

Course its one way, but as I'm bound in POK thats not a problem, for 
tanks, though, well I hope you've got your OT hammer packed.

Too late for me to make use of this shortcut to make CS a happy hunting 
grounds, the wyverns are all cyan to me now with rare exception; I 
leveled my cleric from 44 to 50 or so soloing these things about half of 
each level.  I recall, though, once we got to raiding levels, that a 
port to CS became a very frequent occurance, rushing off to DN or WW or 
TOV all the time.  Assuming the same sort of thing is in my gnome's 
future, this shortcut is going to be fantasticly helpful.

And its going to cut into the income of the few remainging porting 
druids, since this is the one location I can think of I'd still be 
willing to pay for a port to.
