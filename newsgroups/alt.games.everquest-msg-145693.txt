It may also help to understand that at the time Adams wrote this, he
was really addressing the distinctive adoption of Mill's
Utilitarianism as the leit motif of popular democracy.  The Brits,
loyal to the King and all were still sticking to Hobbes' Leviathan.

The distinction can be drawn rather simplistically as "if it's good
for the king it's good enough for me" versus "we must all commit
ourselves to the social contract by putting forth our best character
and efforts"

Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any shall note itï¿½. Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle.
