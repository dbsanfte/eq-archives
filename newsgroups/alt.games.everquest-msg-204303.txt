Yo.

ok, well, heres wat I have:

connection - DSL w/1.5 Mb down/ 128k up
AA- Run 3
encumberance - 96/121

my bard is 56 currently, using Nostrolo's tambourine.  my lvls at the
time were:
50 when with the SK; I had no aa
55 when with the ranga; run2
52 when with the druid; no aa
54 when with the shammy; run2

now the times I was left behind were, noting aa's/connections/and
weight, by:
52 SK (no aa run speed, dsl, and middle encumb)
61 ranga (run 3 iirc, not sure of connection, and 150/210 enc)
54 druid (no run speed, 56k modem, not sure of the enc atm)
57 shammy (run 3, I think college network connection, not sure of the
enc atm)

I *did* ask wat their respective encumberances were at each time (it
was the FIRST thing I askd each actually), and as it turned out all
three had agi that were 20+ points higher than mine (both the SK and
the ranga were around 140 agi or more....I wished my monk had that or
my pally had that.)

those R the facts as I remember them to the best of my ability; to
*ME* it seems as tho agi played a factor.

also, I would like to note that I have been 40 - 50lbs over my max,
and STILL managed to stay with different members of an acrylia
collecting party once.....I didnt have the most but I WAS 3 heaviest. 
selo's doesnt seem to affect encumberences the way other movement
boosters do; Ive seen ppl who were sluggish with SoW cast on them jump
right to my rate of movement when I offered them selo's, so take that
as U will.

if any1 else can give an explanation then Im all ears and happy to
recieve.

l8r!
