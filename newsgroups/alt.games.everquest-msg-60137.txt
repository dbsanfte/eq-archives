I found, at early levels, monks fists are pretty poor compared to most 1hb
weapons (incl a cracked staff) but the weapons weigh a lot and it would be
better to use fists anyway for the weight.
Agree with what everyone else said about making sure you keep both 1hb and
H2H maxed (2hb also, I found I was doing far more damage with a Greenwood Bo
at 20th than I could with my fists)
When I started my monk, nearly 2 years ago, I am certain I didn't get Dual
Wield till 4th level. Can anyone confirm this? Did I just miss the skill
when training or was this something that was altered? I do remember all the
warriors and rangers around Qeynos asking me what level I was when I was
running around at 4th level with 2 cracked staffs.
