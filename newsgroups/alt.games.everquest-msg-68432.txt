Played last night and, other than lag, everything was more or less okay.
This morning when downloaded the patch and logged in all my graphics
were completely fubared. PC's are, for want of a better description,
really, really fuzzy. Can't tell one face from another. Trees have no
texture, etc. I would really like to know if this is just on my computer
or if there are other people having this problem. I'm using a Geforce2
64mb card, installed last week and the latest drivers as of last week.
I'm going to go on a driver hunt now; but I'm not real optimistic. /sigh
