Unscrupulous tells Sony, "Daah, I seem to have fergot my username and 
     password... but I have the CD key. Can you look it up for me?"
Sony tells Unscrupulous, "No, but I can set you a new one. Hang on a 
     minute.  What would you like it to be?"

Unscrupulous tells himself, "TeeHee.  So glad I figured out how to steam 
     off those labels and glue 'em back on.  And the shrinkwrap machine at 
     work made it look even -more- new.  Paypalsucker will never see this 
     coming!"
