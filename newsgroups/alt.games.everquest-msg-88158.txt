Amen man.  This is known in MMOG development as the "Necromancy Option".

In the history of Ultima Online, at about the time EQ launched, they
developers were touting how necromany was going to be introduced into the
game and had even published some phony, unfinished elements of it to the
game.  It was all of course a bunch of bullshit meant to keep people from
subscribing to EQ right away.

GM events + clustefuck hardware patch = Necromancy Option(tm)

Boy, I'd love to participate in some events but SINCE MY FUCKING SPELLS LOOK
LIKE IM LOOKING AT IT THROUGH A FUCKING WELDING MASK AND THE SKY SEEMS TO
FLICK BETWEEN NIGHT AND DAY FASTER THAN A FLOURESCENT TUBE ON ITS LAST LEG,
guess I'll have to take a pass.

Oh, and in case I didn't make the point in another post I've made, fuck you
VI.
