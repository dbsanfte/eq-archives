Your characters are guaranteed safe for 3 months (or is it 90 days). After
that they will be vulnerable to deletion when Verant runs a clean-up. So far
such a clean-up has happened precisely *zero* times. All characters from all
cancelled accounts are still, afaik, there.

A caveat is that currently development work at Verant is focused on
something which involves character storage, so there MIGHT be a purge coming
soon.
