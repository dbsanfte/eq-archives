Again, you're missing the point.  They're not just the "best" chance.
They're the ONLY chance.   Even then, they won't "skate" through
like core members of a high-end guild.   They'll pass, but it'll be close.
Take one of them away and they can't pass.   So THEY can get through
the trials but they can NOT carry the rest of the guild through them.
As an example, they have a 61 cleric with enough AAXP for MGB,
etc.   Even with the 61 cleric doing the pre-trial buffing, they can NOT
get a 58 cleric in the same guild through the trial;  he doesn't have the
mana reserves even buffed with everything possible.

Yeah, mid-50s to upper-50s, with a scattering of lower-50s.  But you're
still missing the point.   How cohesive a guild do you have if the key
players, generally the leadership of the guild, HAVE to play in zones to
which the majority of the guild doesn't have access?   You lose the bonding
caused by *grouping* together.  Unless you're a pure raiding guild, it's
*grouping* that forms bonds.   And family guilds, by definition, aren't
raiding guilds.

In theory, no.  But in reality, yes.   Guilds stay together because they
have a bond, one generally formed around grouping together.   It's a
rare guild that can survive when its members don't group anymore.
In order to group, either the higher-level people (who generally are
motivated to level and advance) have to play alts or the lower-level
people (who generally aren't as strongly motivated to level) have to
spend time on the leveling grind.   You're expecting one group to
not do what it wants how it wants.   That's not going to happen, at
least not in a game setting people play for enjoyment.
