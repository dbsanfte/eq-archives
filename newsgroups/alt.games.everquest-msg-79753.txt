I had that problem the very first time I tried to run Luclin
(day of the release) with my i810, but the patch later that
day fixed it.

Make sure you have all the latest patches, are running DirectX 8.1,
run DxDiag.exe to check) and have the latest i810 graphics drivers 
installed:
   http://www.intel.com/design/software/drivers/platform/810.htm?iid=PCG+devside&

Also go into your eqclient.ini file (found in your Everquest
directory) and make sure that every "LoadArmorNN" line is
set to "TRUE".
