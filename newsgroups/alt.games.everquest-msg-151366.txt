I agree BUT "press and hold the UP key?"

I used to do that three years ago.  Complained about it once in
guild chat (commenting that I was leaving a brick on my keyboard
so I could run across SK while AFK) and got the same mockery
then that I'm giving you now.

Stand in a nice clear area with no mobs around you or in your way.
Tap the NUMLOCK key once.  Don't hold it down, just a single
tap will do.  After a while, tap it again.

Now retire the brick.

ps: left and right will still work for steering, but up or down
will break the numlock effect.  As far as I know there is
no "reverse numlock" key that would let you run backwards
without leaning on the down arrow, pity, as my bard has been
casting an eye upon my old brick pile.
