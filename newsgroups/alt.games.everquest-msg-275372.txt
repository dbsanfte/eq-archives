You have already been officially named the winner, Oneiromancer.

Hmm... that's a bit cumbersome, isn't it?   For the same effect, try:

Also, I've been a bit lazy lately.  I promised to put up an updated
list for the next merger, but never did.  Well, actually no, I haven't
been lazy at all.  I've started exercising and working out, trying to
get rid of some of this Annie Baggage I'm toting around.  And I haven't
been on my computer as much, as a result.  But I promise, kids, this
weekend I will post the new, updated list, in a new thread. 
Oneiromancer, I hope you will submit a new date.  It will be
interesting to see if you have any spooky psychic powers and stuff.

Too bad you didn't see the original "You're a winner!" thread when
it was posted, though.  I sure hope a neighbor didn't swipe your prize
when I shipped it.  


Oh, and about the lunch issue, I think our thief moved on.  But
that's ok.  I like the hot sauce I bought.

Auggh!  Netscape isn't allowing me to post this.  I had to cut n paste
it into the Emarr Portal.  I need a new browser.
