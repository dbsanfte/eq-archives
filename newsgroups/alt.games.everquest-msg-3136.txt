Well, depends on what you'd rather do.  Do you want to be on the front lines, or
doing big nuke damage, or do you want to be a support class?  Or perhaps a mix?
For front lines, start a Warrior.  For nuke damage, start a Wizard.  For support
class, start a Cleric or Shaman.

EQ's pretty diverse, and it does good to serve everyone's preferences.  The
drawback is that there's no single good "starter" character.

I think, though, if I had to recommend one class/race to a brand new character
to start out with... I'd say Ranger.  Go with either Half Elf or Human.  Wood
Elves are great, too, but Greater Fay is, socially, a brutal zone to start in.
Too may jerks and KSers.  Humans and Half Elves will start out in Qeynos and
Qeynos Hills, respectively, which are both pretty good newbie areas.  Half
Elves, while having butt-ugly donut hats ;), can see in the dark, too.

You might also consider a Halfling of most any class, as Misty Thicket is
probably the *best* newbie area in Norrath.

Just avoid playing a Bard or an Enchanter until you know the game.  Both are
complex to play, and playing them well relies on understanding the game basics
and some of the nuances--save those for later, once your feet are wet and you're
getting yourself around OK.

Good luck :)
