I always love conflation.

Movie 1 - What's New Pussycat (Peter O'Toole, Peter Sellers, Woody Allen,
Ursula Andress).  Remember the theme song by Tom Jones?

Move 2 - What's Up, Doc (Barbra Streisand, Ryan O'Neal).

Me, I blame it on all the "Carry On" movies.  (Best one, Carry on up the
Khyber!)

By the way, if you want to see a "What's Up" movie that's great, find
"What's Up Tiger Lily?".

Oh, as to the OP, he's a pussy.  Really, he's a bud off a tree!
