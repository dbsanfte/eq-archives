Though I don't like hearing eq (or anyone) being falsely accused, I did not
read that she was asking for money.  She was asking for information.  So the
question that should be addressed is whether she should be (or even could
be) given information about her *adult* son's account and 'life' history.
Sony claims they can't because it is private information.  I'm surprised
they didn't just say that they don't have that information, but maybe they
do have it logged somewhere.
