   Sure, it's a great idea, but they put the gnome in the wrong zone.  So
unless you pay for the GoD (I think) expansion, you're stuck with a helm
graphic you hate?   I think that GoD is an expansion that many people
skipped over (I knew several people who skipped past it, and I wish I had
done the same).  So is losing the helm graphic worth springing for the
expansion?  I think that many might think not, and still be annoyed by
being cut out.

    Turning EQ into a land of have and have-nots over such a basic
privilege is just not a great idea, IMO.
