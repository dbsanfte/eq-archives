Hmmm 31 here, and I know what you mean Lokari.....Seems like only yesterday
when I was stuck in the 80's as a teenager.......(Hasn't affected me at all!
*twitch*).

I suspect a lot of the player base is older than it would at first
appear.....It's just EQ can bring out the worst in us humans....(Not saying
there hasn't been a fair share of good bits too mind you).
