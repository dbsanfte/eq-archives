I would have to agree.

I would agree with that as well, though IMO, that also makes them less
meaningful. Anyone can easily become master of some tradeskill while 
levelling up adventuring. It really requires little effort outside the 
course of typical gameplay.

Blizzard is going to be some time in getting over.
