So, why is French bashing bad, and American bashing good?  Why is it when we
air legitimate grievances about the French, it's bashing?  I'm sorry, but I
don't believe in protected classes of people, French included.  They have
proven to show poor judgment in the question of Saddam's threat, and are a
piss-poor ally right now.  That's the way I see it, and if that's bashing
them in your view, oh well.
