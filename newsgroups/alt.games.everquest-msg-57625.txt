The tome sucks ass, I have one in the bank I was going to try to sell
but like the other poster says really you can't give this thing away
it sucks so. It comes off some other guy around there, forgot the
name. Would be lucky to get 130 plat for it.

The chancellor might be level 45 or so, he is a shaman with a pet and
he loves to try and root which can actually work to your advantage if
you res the root (he continually tries to root you at the expense of
other spell casting) His nuke is pretty big also unless you have good
cold res or the druid resist circle.  He drops the jade chokadai prod
which is part of the howling stones key quest and also a good shaman
pierce with 6 wis until they get better.

I probably farmed like 50 jade prods and sold them at 1 k plat down to
500 plat (the later more lately) and also gave them away to buddies
questing for the key. I did it while it was particularly easy to me
because I was high warmly to sarnaks and it took a very long time for
me to finally get KOS (just did) I got that way before kunark came
out, since when you killed that frog you can auto spawn in misty you
got iksar (non real faction it turned out) and sarnak (real faction)
both raised. So I killed the frog a lot when bored figuring it might
do me some good. Kunark came out when I was level 47 or so and I think
they nerfed the frog raising those factions at that point (he does not
now) It took me a while to figure out why I was warmly to sarnaks and
make the connection. 

So from 49 plus, the channcellor was incredibly easy for my druid
because I was warmly with all the other sarnaks so I could just walk
right in and kill the channcellor in front of them and as soon as he
died, they all joined in beating down his pet which was trying to
attack me. It took me until level 55 to finally get down to threaten
with them, after a whole lot o' kills. Now he is quite a lot harder
since you almost always have at least a couple of the other sarnaks
joining in beating on you if kos. What I do is wait until he is more
or less alone on the platform, root his dog first, ensnare him, then I
run back and forth by his throne just flat out chain nuking him before
too many of his buddies jump in. If they jump in I snare them too then
ignore them. He dies and I gate to a bind point in Lake of ill far out
of aggro range.

I used to bind right in the middle between the fort and gob caves then
hit him, hit gorlick with the mithril staff, go off and sell them then
come back and hit them again.
