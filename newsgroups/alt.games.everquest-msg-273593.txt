Does anyone have the breakdown of how many gnolls you must kill to reach the
various levels and finally "hunter"? What about the poster in the city you
can check your kill status? Anyone know where that is?

Also, what are the parts for? Someone has told me it's for part of the Mega
Hunter (not the real name, but all I could think of) later in levels, but
does anyone know how it works?

What about goblin parts? I made a new character a Goblin hunter and
collected all the parts while I was at it. Will they come in handy later, or
are they just taking up space in the bank?
