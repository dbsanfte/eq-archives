You will not evade me, "Kilmir" <nospam@kill.com>:

[snip fun crazy story]

Nothing's better than when a situation like that doesn't get people
killed :) The only one that comes to mind for me is being in a regular
group with me, a cleric, some melees in burning woods around level 44,
and getting within aggro range of a forest giant ancient I was trying
to harmonoy while we had enough health/mana for a blue a few seconds
before one of the melees went linkdead. The cleric went oom, the
giant's health dropped but so did the health of our group, and I
decided to use my last sliver of mana on a nuke instead of a heal. The
nuke landed and knocked him into flee mode, everyone lived and he died
a minute before the linkdead melee came back :)

>Rhand lvl 44 Dwarf Mage, Vazaelle
>Mahrim lvl 23 Dwarf Mage, Vazaelle

Based on the above, is Mahrim a dwarf warrior who was raised by the
Felwithe mage guild and had it 'rub off' on him? :)
