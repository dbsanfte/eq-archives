In my main hotkey bank I have Forage, Spells(meditate), Sense Heading,
Track, and /who all GUILD in #9 slot, /who all friends in #10, and a brain
fart in the other 4.  =P

Second bank has my heal hotkey (/g GHealing %t, /cast 2); forage; track;
sense heading; my assist key(/assist) which I use for assist healing where
you target a melee, hit assist to target whatever you're fighting, and then
hit assist again to target whomever is currently recieving the monsters
wrath; as well as a few other keys I don't ever use for nuking( got tired of
telling everyone I was about to nuke, I just do it), and snaring, which
tended to spam people because I'd get resists a few times.

I do like emotes, but since I don't spend much time in wolf form except for
certain places, *cough*Lfay*cough*, the wolf specific emotes are wasted,
although I do have a "/em winks mischievously at %t" emote keyed, which
tends to come in handy when people stare at my chest or butt, or I get a
rude SoW beggar who doesn't notice I just cast Scale of Wolf on him (or
Spirit of Scale, whichever the level 29 one is).
