I have never heard of this "bulldog" role before. Is this only common in the higher level
groups?  Problem is, I don't always have a potential "bulldog" available. One group that
lasted for five hours on sunday had me, four casters, and a much lower level (22 or 23)
paladin. (Not exactly bulldog material, as I was outdamaging him badly.)  Hrmmm... food for
thought.
