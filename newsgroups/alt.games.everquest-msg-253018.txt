I loved that song.  And I wasn't much into heavy metal back in those days,
although I did regularly listen to AC/DC's Back in Black (whoah, 70's, I'm
*old*).

The lyrics are surprisingly intelligent for the genre.  =)

Oh, you're so condescending.
Your gall is never-ending.
We don't want nothin', not a thing from you.

Your life is trite and jaded,
Boring and constipated.
If that's your best, your best won't do.

Great music video, too.
