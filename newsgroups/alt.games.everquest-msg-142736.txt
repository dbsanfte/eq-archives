Of course, a paladin's time is divided between his cleric and martial
training.  None the less, if we can bring back the dead for about 10% less
XP than a Cleric, then we should be able to 75% heal, as well.

IIRC, Barbarian Shamen can worship the Marr siblings, so I don't think the
nature of the diety plays into it.  Rather, the nature of the race, or the
nature of the calling.  A shaman is a medicine-man and a spiritualist.
Based on the shaman buffs, and the alchemy trade skill, I don't think they
do their job in the same way that a cleric does.  While the difference has
left their healing a bit weaker, it has also allowed them other advantages
that clerics don't have.

In this, they actually seem more like Paladins in their calling.  Instead of
Holy Crusader, they are Nature's Warriors.  Again, though, the power of
nature will probably be far less than direct healing from a deity, so they
shouldn't measure up to Clerics, nor can their methods be compared.

Then a ranger's offensive set makes sense, while a paladin has a more
defensive disposition (thus, better heals).  Looked at another way, paladins
are a subset of the best healing class, so their heals should be better than
the rangers'.

Not quite.  Shadow Knights don't deal with arcane magic, but rather with
necormancy, and if you try to create a necromancer, you'll see there are
only three possibilities: Innourk, Bertox, and Cazic Thule.  So, necormancy
is definalty diety based, and by extension, Shadow Knights are tied to a
diety.
