Why was The Bazaar implemented the way it was?  It seems to punish
those without 24x7 Internet access, because they can't leave their
PCs sitting for hours or days on end in trader mode.

I think I would have implemented a "consignment shop" approach.
Take your wares somewhere and give them to an NPC merchant with
instructions to sell them for X pp.  Check back occassionally to
see if your item sold and, if so, get paid.  Perhaps have the NPC
merchants take 10% off the top as a service fee.

These "consignment shop" merchants could exist in multiple
locations.  Your wares could be sold while you were off-line.
No more unfair advantage to 24x7 Internet access users.  And
it would remove the need for a dedicated zone that brings even
the most uber PC to its knees.  The "consignment shop" merchants
could be linked like bankers (or not, depending on how it would
all balance out).

Before some of the crabby regulars (you know who you are) start
accusing me of whining, I have 24x7 broadband access.
