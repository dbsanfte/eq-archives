You can get that on FV for the same price as a regular server, and
there's plenty of people to group with at all levels.  No alts though,
and some other really FU rules. 

Thanks for your info (although original .  I'm still really p.o.ed at
Sony about thier GM support after the recent change.  I lost a 10k item,
and a bunch of other stuff (that's more money than I've ever seen) to a
rez bug, that I had just looted.  Thier support site was down and I
petitioned for weeks with no results.  The only reason I would go to a
legends server would be for the GM support, apperantly even that's gone.
