Offhand, name of zone? Tactics isn't it.. because the MB gets open
raided all the time. Furthermore, there is an alt-key quest your group
could do. Tower of Solusek Ro might be it, but most of the flags for
it are open raided all the time. Or are you one of the guys who sits
back and scoffs and bemoans open raids while they succeed and the
people get flags? VP since revamp would sure fit your criteria though.
