Would that, then, be two non-Wiccans in agreement about Wiccan subject
matter?

I say again, the Tetragrammaton has no meaning to the Wiccan religion.

Let me emphasize the important part that maybe you're overlooking:

The Tetragrammaton has no meaning to the Wiccan *religion*.


Yes, for his particular Wiccan tradition, Gardner borrowed from the
Kabbalah. But then, he also borrowed from Kipling and other sources.
He drew on the Key of Solomon for his rituals, certainly, but he
greatly modified and simplified them over time, making them more
'pagan' and less Hebrew. 

Gardner himself made distinction in his own Book of Shadows between
the "Witch", referring to a Wiccan practitioner, and the "Magus",
referring to the ceremonial magician (Kabbalistic practitioner).

The presence of Kabbalistic symbology in Wicca simply reflects that
some symbols, or 'forms', were borrowed. That is totally unrelated to
the 'gospel', if you will, of Wicca.

In the same way, while pagan symbology appears in the practices of
many Christians (Christmas trees, the Easter bunny, etc), paganism has
no meaning to the Christian religion.
