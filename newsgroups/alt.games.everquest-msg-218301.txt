The root of these problems in forming groups is the cursed 7 level
limit. Its completely unneeded and causes a great deal of problems by
limiting your potential group mates. What would be the problem in
bringing a 52 cleric along with level 65s? Very badly thought out
IMHO. IF you can average out the levels across 7 levels you can do it
over 15 particularly at the high end. Enjoying LDoN less and less due
to this problem of building groups. And btw this Wizzie dont come to
the camp till people are gtg otherwise quadding is better xp than LDoN
due to the horrid dead time involved. But then I can get there pretty
quick :)
