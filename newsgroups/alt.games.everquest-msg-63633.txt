Greetings,

I was stationed in Germany for three and a half years.  I had internet
service through a local service provider and it cost me 50.00 Marks per
month for unlimited time.  Now I'm not sure what the exchange rate is
anymore.  But you will also be paying a the cost of a local phone call to
hook up the service provider.  All in all it was more expensive than the
states, but you will also be getting cost-of-living allowance while you are
there that is supposed to make up the difference.
