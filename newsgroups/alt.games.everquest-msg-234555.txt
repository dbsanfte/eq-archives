Before i do my usual nit-picking, grats on clearing time =) (Would say Grats
on Quarm.. but VZ and Inni are harder fights! heh)

Thank god your not the man with the plan in Silent Tempest, huh? =)
Actually I never really heard any whacky strats or ideas for Inni before...
but VZ, some I heard were just nuts heh

Pouch ranks up there with DBotW for monks (its not just about having a 180hp
range item, its the fact you don't need to keep un-equiping your uber
stats/hp ranged item, in order to load 0HP shurikens/Javelins to pull. The
range is awesome, and the ratio makes it a fun toy (though it doesn't get as
much use as a kiting tool now, that they are single summoned instead of a
stack/click)

Actually Cazic is not tethered either.

Word of warning - Quarm roams.  Its probably not in your best interests to
keep fighting him with ninja self agro.. so if you need buffs, specific
groups etc.. do them uptop before clicking down

He's a pretty unusual mob.. whilst his max hit is way up there, his average
is more like.. 300 heh.
He also AE ramps, but again this isn't a probem.. when he claws you for 20
and such

> ducking out of the CH.  The AE's go off and I resist most of them.

Did you really resist most, or just seemed you did (fast cures and such)?
I can get to 500 in all resists fairly easily, and I sure as hell don't
resist most of them. Infact, I've never seen anybody (visually from hp bars,
from asking for cures, or general chit chat) say that they resist "most" of
them.. or even close to like, a half of them.

I mean as a comparison, I can go an entire bertox fight week in week out,
and 0-1 ae's will hit me each week.  The stuff quarm casts, and the proc
from his adds though.. forget it heh.

Whilst I wouldnt say you are not capable of them... really, comparing ldon
time raids as insignificant now you've completed PoTime, is a long way from
reality.  Even the easiest Time Adventure theme makes PoTime look like a
walk in the park.

Grats again =) Welcome to the farm!
