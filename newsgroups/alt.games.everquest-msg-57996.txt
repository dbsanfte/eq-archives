Well, I feel what you're saying, but they're PAID to do just that.  If they
want to play, let them play on their own time.

I once worked at a call center, but you didn't see me having fun with the
customers calling in with problems.  : )  Sure would have been fun if I had,

The "endless stream of petitions from irate customers" who now have to wait
until the GM gets his yayas in?  Although to be fair, you've got to figure
there won't BE and endless stream all the time, but surely there's got to be
other things a GM can do that's good for them AND the customers.
