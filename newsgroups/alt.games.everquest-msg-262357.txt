Of course, percentage figures don't need to be "adjusted for inflation",
which is always an exercise in guesswork (for reference, try to make
automobile and home prices, most American's biggest expenses, fit with any
estimate of the proclaimed inflation rate for any year since the 1970s).

Comparing absolute numbers to other contemporary absolute numbers might work
(but of course leads to another percentage figure).
