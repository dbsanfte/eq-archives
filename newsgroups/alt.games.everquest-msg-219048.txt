On this subject I would say my conclusions are pretty spot-on considering
how CEO salaries and executive compensation have skyrocketed to
shamefully obscene heights in America.  Yet the majority of people either
ignore the situation or just complain a bit in private.  There should be
rioting in the streets over this issue.........but people just don't seem
to care enough, and they won't until it's too late.  Kiss the middle
class in America goodbye, it's slowly-but-surely eroding and it may
never return.
