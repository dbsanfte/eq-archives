How does that make it untrue?  Try going to a few local caucauses (sp?)
and see if you don't feel like you're being left out in the cold.
Hell, these alleged "grass roots" political events are even more
partisan and factional than the larger scale conventions, with members
of the various cliques constantly sniping at one another and the
candidates.  Everybody's busy pursuing their narrow little agendas with
both hands clamped in a death grip on their blinders lest any fool seek
a consensus, or even worse, try to inject reason into the contentious
gabbling that passes for debate.
