]yaaay, now I have spmeone else to chat to =)

Well, the nda has been lifted.

The frame rate varied froim 0.4 to 12.1 fps every couple of seconds.
I was told it was a server issue. It did get better with only 1000
players, it wasawful with 2,000 players. Hopefully it gets fixed as
it rather ruined pay for me.

Overall I liked it, what I got to play of it. The graphics are good,
if you have the video card to show them.
