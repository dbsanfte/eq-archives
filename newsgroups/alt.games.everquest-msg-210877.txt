I had no problem soloing warrior up to mid-40s using nothing better
than crafted and a BABS. Until then nothing ever put me in danger when
I fought them from 50 health. So as long as I had bandages I could
solo.

After that point the amount the mobs were hitting for outstripped my
armor, and soloing became too dangerous to be worth it. Perhaps later
I could have, when equipment caught back up, but by then what's the
point? Grouping fifty times better exp anyways.
