My Druid partner and I campe the underwater tower in LR for the
tainted/corrupted aqua gobbie for 3 hours the other night and he didn't
show. Previous to this we camped and got a tainted every 30 minutes (which
I've read on other sites it the correct spawn time) just didn't get the
corrupted to spawn. Anyone know if this spawn is broken? Or is there
something I'm missing?
