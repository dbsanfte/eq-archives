Thats the instrument mod.  Divide it by 10 and that is the multiplier that
instrument applies to songs effects that can have strength multipliers
applied to them.  So a drum with a 22 rating will make your dots do 2.2x
what damage they would normally do.  This multiplier does not apply to haste
or mana regen.
