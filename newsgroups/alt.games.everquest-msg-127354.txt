You don't need the "Long fight" part of that.    Just Dead Solo Rogue.  Rogues
are debatably the worst soloing class.

In a group situation, or with certain weapons, it is very very likely that you
will run out of stamina before you run out of mobs.   And considering you will
be in groups or raids ninety percent of the time, that is what you should be
planning for.

Step back?  So your solution to doing less damage is to stop attacking
altogether and do no damage?

Those skills max extremely quicky anyways.   Thus, worthless.   Maybe you have
to get swung at 10 times instead of 5 to gain a point.  Big deal.  In the end,
both the rogue with the Agility and the rogue without will both end up with
the skills all maxed, but the one who didn't buy agility will have more useful
stats.

Procs can add several hundred damage to each fight.  Aside from that, it's the
only proven (useful) effect of higher dexterity.

Cite, please.

Of course, it all depends on your completely unsupported assertation that
dexterity has anything to do with landing backstabs.  My rogue does not have
super high dexterity, and has had absolutely no problems landing backstabs.

Woo...  and exactly how much damage do those throws do?    Ever wonder why you
don't see Rogues doing the same kind of bow kiting that Rangers sometimes do?
Ever see a rogue stop in the middle of combat, back up and start throwing
daggers while the mob is being tanked?  No?  Ever wonder why?

Big deal.  So  you stay parked in front of a door in befallen for five hours
instead of six.   I'd much rather have an extra 60 hit points permanently, and
be that much closer to the point where my combat does not slow down, ever.

If you say so....
