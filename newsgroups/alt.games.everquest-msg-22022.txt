I got a /tell once from a player who I didn't know from Adam, whose
level I didn't know because he was anonymous, asking me if I could
give him 30 pp!  I told him sorry, I didn't even HAVE 30 pp!  I was
tempted to say something to somebody in his guild but I didn't (I
probably would have if he had kept bugging me), but I did write his
name down with a minus sign next to it (I have a habit of writing
players' names down and putting a plus sign next to it if they did
something real nice, or a minus sign if they are a jerk).
