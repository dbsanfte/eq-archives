You are vastly underestimating what a good player can do.  First,
though, I'll start with an average player--myself.  I used to play two
accounts.  Say I decide to start a halfling rogue on account two.  I'd
bring my shaman from account one over to Misty Thicket and sit him on
a stump somewhere.  The rogue would come over and get buffed and
SOWed.  Shaman sits down.  Rogue goes out and finds something yellow
or better, and brings it back.

Reach over to the other keyboard, and hit my stand key, then hit my
key that targets and assists the rogue, then hit the key to cast a
DOT.  As long as the rogue can outdamage the DOT, the rogue gets the
XP.

If the rogue shows any sign of losing, reach over to the other
keyboard and hit the key for a heal.  Sit down.

This makes the first 10 or so levels for the rogue a lot more pleasant
than they would otherwise be.  (I've played over two years...I don't
find the low levels thrilling anymore.  If I try a class totally
different from anything I've played before, it is thrilling while I
learn the spells or abilities, but that generally takes me only a few
fights to figure out).

But I'm just an average player.  A *good* player can do amazing things
with two accounts.  There are people on my server who can play the
primary healing cleric *and* the primary crowd control enchanter in a
group, or on major raids.  Heck, there's a guy in my server's
uberguild (Legacy of Steel) who also plays in an uberguild on another
server.  He can play two characters with active roles when both guilds
are doing uberguild-level things, and neither guild would know he was
doing this if he hadn't told them...he's that good at it.

Even that is nothing.  There have been people who have *four* accounts
and *four* computers, and have played all four at once in a group.
The mind boggles at that.

As far as bandwidth goes, 56k is plenty for two EQ sessions.  Only
real problem will be if both zone at the same time, and that usually
just goes a little slower, rather than actually kill the connection.
If you've got ISDN or better, two accounts would be no problem at all.
