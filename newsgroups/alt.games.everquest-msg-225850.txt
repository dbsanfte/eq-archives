Song 1 (to stop singing previous song)
Song 1  (to start singing new song)
wait as long as you can and still have time to do the following
Primary Slot (putting weapon on cursor
Open Inventory Slot (swapping weapon for instrument)
Secondary Slot (instrument for weapon)
Wait for song to finish
Song 2
Song 2
Secondary slot
Open Inventory Slot
Primary slot
wait
Song 3
Song 3
repeat

Simple 3 song twist with a single juggle.

11 clicks per 18 seconds, and not clicking the same button, no, 9 
switches, plus the tempo isn't a series of quarternotes, its two as fast 
as you can, pause as long as you can, three as fast as you can, pause 
till trigger moment, five as fast as you can, wait for trigger, two as 
fast as you can, wait for trigger...  I don't think rangers really 
compete for the biggest high speed clickfest prize

But since I do a 5 twist, often with two instrument swaps, I'm not 
worried about the ranger competition at all.
