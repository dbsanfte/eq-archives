Custom skins change both the look and the content of some/all of the
windows to varying degrees depending upon the skin. It is possible to
mix'n'match different UI elements so you can assemble your UI the way
you want.

Check out www.eqinterfaces.com for more info.

My experience with them has been that some are quite good but many are
a pain in the rear. They also seem to cause problems at regular
intervals (especially after patches ;) and require me to revert to the
default for a while.

Check em out, play with em and if you don't like em - go back to the
default :)
