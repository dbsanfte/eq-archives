While I have not played any of the other games you mention, I have played
EQ...twice. I quite cold-turkey sometime back and recently felt that 'grip'
on me again, so I started back up, this time with my wife. Guys, if you can
swing this, DO. Because now, EQ time is 'together' time. Yes it's lame, but
we need to seize any advantage we are offerred in this whole relationship
thing because quite frankly, we're not too good at it.

Anyway, yes it is hack and slash, but I think it's hack and slash for people
who don't like hack and slash, because at least there's a 'purpose'. Noobs
are treated GREAT in my experience, and it can be mindless and tedious, but
one of the things I find fun is trying to come up with interesting ways to
'mold my characters existance'...anyway.



Here's a little article I found that I found humorous, but strangely
accurate. Maybe it will help.
