	Not correct according to the Harpy's Head material.  Firiona Vie was given
amnesia by the Ring of Scale (when she offered to share her knowledge with
them...she didn't realise they'd literally take it from her).  During her
recuperation she was captured by minions of Venril Sathir (not the Iksar
Empire as such).

|16. Firiona Vie is "freed" from Veeshans Peak.

	Actually she was rescued from a bunch of Sathir's goons during a ritual
intended to corrupt her (Tunare-provided) staff.

	The daughter taken to Neriak is gone, and has been for some time.  There
is a rumor that she is now in Cabilis, but that quest has been broken from Day
One and no one really expects it to ever be fixed.  (Some have hypothesized
that this may have been the start of the original Firey Avenger quest, but
that has never been substantiated.)

	Other than that, it's a lot of good stuff.  Just don't read too much into
what's going on.  Things in EQ are usually simpler than they appear, and very
often the GMs themselves have no idea what's going on.  (Frinstance all the
stuff about the Teir'dal attacking Highpass...uh, Carson McCabe WORKS FOR
THEM, so why would they bother?)
