EXACTLY!!!

A perfect example of this is from another (much smaller) online game
Warbirds. It was originally a 2D game. In order to add 3D support they
modified the system to paint the 3D textures over the existing 2D
game. If you wanted to run in 3D, your system had to draw the 2D game
first and then the 3D overlay. At the time all of the players joked
that the game was "3D Decelerated", because of the huge performance
hit when you ran in 3D.

I think EQ suffers from a similar problem. It seems that no matter how
much horsepower you have, running with all settings maxed will bring
your system to it's knees anytime a large amount of textures or
polygons are drawn.
