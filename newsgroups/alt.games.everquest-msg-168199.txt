Flash of light to blind and "scare" off adds....

Off-tanking Adds

Pet-Off-tanking Adds

Slowing (when the group doesn't have a Chanter or Shaman)

Beastlords are amazing soloers and they off a LOT to any group. The
hardest part is finding a group that recognizes how good the class
really is. Easiest way of doing this is to solo the same mobs that a
group is fighting right in front of them heheh :-P
