Much of the Enchanter Epic is now soloable to many enchanters.  It
has, however been long since superceeded as expansions, new levels,
skills and equipment have been introduced.

Yes I have got my Epic & had it for some time (pre PoP), no I've never
really used it other than on raids to quickly rehaste the tanks when
mana was low.  Oh & clerics like it too as it stacks with Yaulp series
of spells.  It must have taken me over a year from starting to
completing during which time I aquired Speed of the Brood (Group Snake
speed) & my Staff of the Silent Star.  Still its a nice trophy to
have.
