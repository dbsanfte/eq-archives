It does make me wonder what sort of legal problems SOE might find
itself entangled in if such a service was offered to EQ1.  My
understanding of EQ2 is that SOE has so limited the opportunity to
grief-for-gain that there can never be a fight over who owns the
"limited license" to the equipment that just dropped, because the
coding ensures that no dispute can arise.

In EQ1, if you are fighting a monster that is holding an item that's
going for $200 on the Exchange, what happens when someone killsteals
you?  What happens when someone trains you out and gets you killed?
What about ninjalooting?  What about cheating on random rolls?  What
happens if you win a roll on an item that's going for $150 and the guy
who looted it decides he doesn't want to give it to you?  And it
doesn't have to be worth a lot of money, since theoretically, every
item that drops on the server has a real world monetary value.

Suddenly, a player can show genuine monetary damage from an interaction
with another player, and I'd be real leery of that and its legal
consequences if I were SOE.
