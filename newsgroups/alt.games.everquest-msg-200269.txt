The thing is a game shouldn't be designed like this, Im obviously
having a lot of difficulties with EQ, but i haven't played all that
much between then and now, i didn't play all that much due to the fact
that a buddy was going to be getting the game (im a lot more
charismatic in life than i appear to be on this board and therefore
have relative ease convincing people to try things). The initial post,
regardless of what you may think was not designed to be a troll
message. While it wasn't the nicest message it could've been, i felt
the need to rant, to get it out of my system. When i've encountered
posts like this on issues that i know about I attempt to be helpful as
flaming them creates a negative atmosphere.

What really surprises me is that this game appears to be very newbie
unfriendly. I've often thought about how cool it would be to set up a
Newbie/ Veteran system where the newbie pays a portion of the Vets.
monthly fee to get a sort of IG tutor.

I will close by apologizing for initially posting such a negative
inital post.
