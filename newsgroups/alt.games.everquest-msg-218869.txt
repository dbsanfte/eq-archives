I try to stay around 70-80mana in XP groups - more than enough mana
for a burndown, and always enough space to eat a rod charge and
get full benefit when the timer refreshes.  Like you Lance, I see
being FM as a loss in potential DPS.  I always pay attention to 
healer mana, if healer mana is dropping faster than mine, then I
burn harder, if mine starts dropping faster than theirs I back off.

Because my mana isn't crucial to the party staying alive, I feel
it's my job to balance my mana use against theirs.  My buddy, who
is usually our puller, asks for mana from the slower/backup healer
regularly when we're pulling hard (LDoN), and when I occasionally
give mine he says "I don't care about yours."  That's not a negative
thing, just an acknowledgement of the fact that my mana isn't crucial.
