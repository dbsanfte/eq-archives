Yeah, especially if the cd keys are unused the best thing to do would
be to give it to a friend. EQ evolutions is so dang cheap now, that I
don't think anyone would "buy" it from you when they could probably
buy it retail with keys that "FOR SURE" had not been used.

The only way to prove the key had not been used, is for you to be in
the room when the person goes to sign up and they go "ooh the keys are
not used you did not lie!"

If I were you I'd keep it myself and sign up for a second account at
some time. Perhaps try to play two characters in the same group with
two instances of EQ in eqwindows (eqwindows.com, does it much better
than regular EQ since they manage memory far better)  I was bored in
EQ and two boxing two characters on the same computer was a lot of fun
for a bit (until they nerfed KEI and I got REAL bored again.)

If you don't actually want to group with a second account, you could
just use it for a bazaar vendor, with all sound and luclin models off,
having it look at the ground or something, while you play your normal
account. The only question is if its worth the addional subscription
fee a month.
