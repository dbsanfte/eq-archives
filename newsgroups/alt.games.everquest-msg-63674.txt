I have read and done some of the quests in the game, but the one that I hear must about is the
'Stein of Moggok'.

In many places i see that it can be sold for 250pp - 400pp, but to whom?? It does NOT say where I
can get that price for it.

If it is to another player i would have guessed that if you can afford that price, you are at a
level that 1) don't need it because you have other items that gives the same stats (from other
quests?). or 2) they have no problem getting it for them selfs (xx)

(xx) I have one as a lvl 12 necro because I am teamed up with an enchanter, so it is not impossible
to get one!!

But still where can I get 250 - 400 pp for selling one??
