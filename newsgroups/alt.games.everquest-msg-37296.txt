Actually a contention could be made that VI evidenced a pro newbie
stance by NOT putting low level content on Velious.  Imagine trying to
get through SG to get to a lvl 6 hunting ground.  Now that would be anti
newbie, so by not doing that it must have been a pro newbie statement.

ROFL, logic, just add salt and twist.  Just about any shaped pretzle can
be created if you are creative enough.  I repeat, the lack of low level
content in a high level expansion does nothing to indicate VI's stance
regarding newbies... unless you really want it to, in which case it can
mean anything you want it to.
