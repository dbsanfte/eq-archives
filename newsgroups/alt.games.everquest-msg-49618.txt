You know, it is worthless people like you that THINK they are being funny
but in reality are
being assanine instead. Were you born without feelings and a brain, or were
they removed at
the same time you became a social misfit? Some people that read these
newgroups have actual
connections to real people, and some of those real people were victims of
the terrorist activities
of 9-11-01.... You think you are being funny, but in truth, you are just
making it harder for people
to get past this. Get a LIFE    Get a CLUE    and stop cross-spamming!

FLAME ------ ON!
