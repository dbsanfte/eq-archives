I will give it a try! I learned two important lessons today. First to
look at the name of the creature after you click on it and before
casting a spell. While it may look like a Pixie Trickster from a
distance, a Faerie Royal Guard does not take kindly to being
interrupted! Second to keep in mind that a creature easily handled by an
equivalent level Warrior or Paladin handles me very well indeed!

And quite a job it will be. I just spent all my hard earned gold on two
backpacks to alleviate constant running to sell loot. Between spells,
coming soon as I made level 4 today with 5 just around the corner and
weapons to better the one I started with, I can see a tough road, or
should I say path, ahead!

I have found the person in the cleric Guild that gives an armor quest,
but as yet all the creatures I need to kill are yellow or red to me.
Other than the starting tunic from handing in my note, all I have
managed to scrounge up is a cloth neck piece from an Orc Pawn. It has
been fun exploring around Felwithe though, even if all the chatter and
messages seem a bit overwhelming at the moment.

Thank you, I have started doing this.

Thank you very much for the offer, but judging from your post it appears
you are a very busy gent! All of this will come to me in time. In a
year's time, I will most likely look back on this post and have a good
chuckle!
