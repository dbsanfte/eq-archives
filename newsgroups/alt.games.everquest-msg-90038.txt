No Idea on the play time at those levels.  I will admit the cougars
might be better I never tried them.

What I did with the runners is this:
I kept a low level swarm spell memed
when I saw two of them turn I ran back and AE the other two and tried
to get them near.  Then I just DOTed what ever was left.  I know it
sounds like a pain but I developed a method that worked great.  Plus I
did it on the 3 spawn Sarnak side.  Never get a Goon over there.

When you get to BW level the Hornets, Apes/Gorillas and Skeles never
turn and run. So you can get any combo of them.

I have tried CS and TD they are just to camped so I never went back.
