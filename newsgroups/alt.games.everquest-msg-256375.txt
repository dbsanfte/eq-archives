Oh yes!  Skill increases of all kinds will come from your offhand.

You will increase Offense, dual-wield, and the weapon's skill;  if you were
a warrior you would also increase double-attack.
Some tips on skillups:
STR helps increase your attack rating, meaning better chance to land a hit.
Dex increases the chance of gaining a skillup on a successful hit.
No offensive skillups are gained beating up on green mobs.
I have only anecdotal evidence that fewer skillups are gotten when fighting
cyan mobs.
Yellow and red mobs are often harder to hit, and therefore have fewer
chances to get a skillup.
