Nice overview I'd say.  The discussion of types of players who may like 
or  dislike was good.  If making numbers go up is your idea of fun this 
game will get boring fast as it is easy to make them go up.  If your 
idea of fun is to craft or interact with other people you may like SWG 
as both are major parts of the game.  I'd imagine the first few months 
will be ugly as the leet and uber folk come to the painful realization 
that this game isn't for them and based on how beta progressed I don't 
see the devs changing the game to accomodate such players.  I really 
think their goal is to build a long term game and they realize that by 
focusing on community building rather than appeasing the number 
crunching folks they can avoid some of the pitfalls that EQ ran into.

Again, it won't be for everyone, which is a good thing.  I think the 
folks that enjoy it will really enjoy it, the folks that hate it will 
really hate it, so warnings such as you put in your review should be 
taken into consideration.  I never got into the PvP and the fighting in 
general never really excited me, but I am looking forward to seeing how 
communities and economies develop.
