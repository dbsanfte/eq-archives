We agree there were lighting issues. As a human I got turned around in 
the 'tunnels' from North Qeynos to S.Q. far more times than anyone has a 
right to, and would as much as quintuple zone as a result.

It was beyond stupid, no question. But I was never so shortsighted as to 
say 'not being able to see in a game is stupid'... it was a case of I 
should be able to see better *here*.

Another example was: getting lost between BB and EF; where for example 
it made sense. That was a  long dark cave. Bring a light source. Good 
game design there.

Trouble was even with a light source, the lighting implementation was so 
bad you might as well not bother. But that was the -implementation- not 
the -vision-.

That's not a corpse recovery. That's what happened when you couldn't 
recover a corpse.

I agree there were -some- corpse recoveries that were impossible or 
nearly so, and losing a corpse as a result is unacceptable. I never 
liked that.

But I don't care for popping corpses into a graveyard a few minutes 
later for convenient rezzing, or summon corpse spells that trivialize 
one of the few stings to death.

FWIW I quite like the new ShadowRest mechanic. If you can't get your 
corpse, your only down a week. Definately painful, definately somehting 
you want to avoid, but you never have to worry about permanently losing 
stuff.

Even fairly dense players usually got along. There was always a market 
for MQ/HQ pelts at the time. And by 12 or so there were a number of 
bronze weapon dropping mobs you could hunt.

And now the gear is the single defining characteristic of a character. 
And worse, content has to be primarily aimed at gear levels, not player 
levels or skills. And worst of all gear is largely not a progression 
like levels or skills... you can simply jump to the best gear from no 
gear at all. (Within some limits, but its not uncommon for characters to 
go from naked to twinked gear (which exceeds the majority of velious era 
stuff) to ele/god gear). Its the dumbest thing to hinge the majority of 
player power from.

You want to avoid a 'powergamer' mentality? Here I thought you -liked- 
the raid game that EQ has become. Only a 'power gamer' mentality can 
sustain that. Less dedicated players simply don't have the sort of 
network of in-game friends and in game organization to put raid after 
raid after raid together. I think the 'raid game' has pandered to the 
powergamer far more than the 'long game'.

I don't think I've ever disputed there was a lot of useless hassle. The 
point is that the useless hassle, by and large, wasn't part of the 
'vision'.
