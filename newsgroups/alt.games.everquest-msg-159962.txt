I've had problems going the "delete the *.txc files" route.
Often, the game will recreate them, and all subsequent
*.txc files, as zero length.

This doesn't break anything, but it destroys the reason
for turning on texture caching in the first place -- the
game will have to rebuild the textures every time you zone.

Once I've had a computer start doing this, the only cure
has been to copy a full set of "healthy" *.txc files from
another computer onto the bugged one.

It's safer to turn off texture caching, then enter the
game, exit, and restart (followed by turning texture caching
back on again), since the game will then itself wipe the
old files and start from scratch, correctly.
