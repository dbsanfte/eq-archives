> What a Great discussion. I've learned a lot, including that I can't kite.

There are many different ways to kite .. necros are good at two of them.

Fear kiting has already been explained. The other is agro kiting. Agro
kiting is when you get the mob really really mad at you, then you run around
screaming like a little girl while the mob chases you and your pet beats on
the mob.

At your level agro kiting is not a valid option, because as soon as your pet
out damages you, the mob will turn to him. But once you start getting up in
levels, you'll be amazed at what you can do. Oh, and agro kiting requires
SoW.

But really, why do we need to quad kite, when we can solo reds? =)~
