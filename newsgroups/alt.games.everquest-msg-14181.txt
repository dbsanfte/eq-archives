No the factions were reset to the default levels, my character was KoS to those
KoS to a newbie of my race/class/religion. My character was a druid so
I was able to teleport around and check my factions all over.

Even if I was non-KoS I would have still complained. This character is my main
character and is not twinked, he is a master of 5 trades skills(soon
to be seven, damn 7th coldain shawl =) )  I am very proud of his factions
and trades and equipment.
