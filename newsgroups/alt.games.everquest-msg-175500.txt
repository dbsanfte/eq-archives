No.

Servers came down for xx hours (4 I think) for a scheduled patch, then came
back up.

I don't know how long after, but in the time it took to kill Cursed, Blood,
Emp, and run to Kael for AoW, a systemwide broadcast announced the servers
were going down for a "brief, 30 minute" patch in 10 mins.

It was still early.. like, 10.30amPST when the servers were took down
