I hope you like soloing, Because with that kinda "I'm so Ubar" attitude your
going to get a very bad rep very fast.

And 1 -12 in one day on a twink is not at all impressive, 1-12 on a char
weilding their newbie weapon and cloth is average nowadays.
I remember back Pre-Luclin It took me weeks to get my SK (my first char over
lvl 2 ) to 15, and it felt great doing it.

A few weeks back I started a troll shammy, took one day to get him to 10
unequiped, and one more day to get to 20 and thats not even comming close to
fast anymore.

So either suck it up and play with the "N00bs" or re-roll.
