Ok, just made 39 on my druid this week, and get these, I know North is EJ
and South is SF.

However, I'm loathe to actually go to either spot since I haven't heard
anything about how safe the port in spot is, for example, I really hate to
port anyone into Iceclad since about 40% of the time I get jumped on port
in.

Particularly the SF port, since most of that zone is aggro and kos (and
still quite red).  The EJ port I'm not as concerned about since I can just
run to the TT zone from about anything and am on good terms with Sev, if
he's managed to survive long enough that is.  (Me and Gorenaire just had tea
again today, glad to see she's still in good health  =P)
