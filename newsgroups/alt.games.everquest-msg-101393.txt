I don't claim to be an expert, either.  I guess I just see myself as a sort
of modern day philosopher who refuses to be guided by reflex emotion on
either side of a controversial issue when rational thought may dispel the
boogeyman.  FYI, this is not meant as a veiled attack on you (as you appear
not to be a panicker either), so please don't take it as such.

If we could agree that, in the x/n and y/n figures above, n were indeed
1000, I would have little to answer your argument.  But what value really
*should* be assigned to n?  That is at the core of the debate.  If you ask
the wild eyed sycophants and loonies, you will get answers ranging from the
millions to a tiny fraction of one, depending on how completely the
respondant has surrendered his independent thought to "the cause", whichever
side of the issue "the cause" happens to be on.

I suspect the truth lies somewhere in between, as it very often does.  But
even rational people will have a difficult time agreeing on an answer.  One
problem is, if you are against nuclear power but haven't actually worked in
a reactor, the pro-nuclear folks can say you don't have all the facts.  If,
on the other hand, you are pro-nuclear and have worked inside a reactor, the
anti-nuclear folks can say your judgement is impaired by a concern for job
security.

So what we are left with is indirect evidence.  I have not seen a huge
amount of news, comparative to the number of reactors operational in the
world, about things going dreadfully wrong.  I think this is even more
compelling when you consider that nuclear "events" are big money news.  The
media is extremely unlikely to pass up a story involving a nuclear accident.
So the number of such accidents you hear about should be higher in
proportion to the total number of those accidents that actually occurred
than would be the case for fossil fuel accidents.

Case in point.  I lived about 20 minutes' drive from a refinery when I was
younger.  For some reason one of those vats exploded, and if I recall, 6
people were killed.  This made the local news for about 3 days.  I never saw
a word about it on CNN.  If the accident had been nuclear in nature, I can't
help believe we'd still hear about it from time to time (like we do Three
Mile Island, where nobody was killed at all).  And I do know why.  There
would be concerns about contamination to the surrounding area, whether well
founded or not.  But the fact remains that nuclear ALWAYS gets headlines.

Anyway, I'm drifting a bit here.  I think if you and I cannot agree on this
issue, it will be bacuase we failed to agree on the value we assign to n.

Yes.  There are a couple of countries with situations like this.  One ex
Soviet nation that did this was Ukraine.  Another ex Warsaw Pact nation that
also runs old, scary reactors is Bulgaria.  But I seem to recall hearing
that many of Eastern Europe's reactors were much larger than their Western
counterparts, and that they are of a design discontinued in the West because
they were not considered safe enough.  Wish I could provide a link to
anything like that, but I'm feeling too lazy to go and look.  I want to say
I originally heard that on CNN, but I'm not 100% certain.  Assuming my
memory doesn't decieve me, then we are back to trying to distinguish where
we have a problem with nuclear power in general, and where we have a problem
with people simply not adhering to safety standards.
