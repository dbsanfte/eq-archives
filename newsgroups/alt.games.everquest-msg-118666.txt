I can think of two guilds on FV that could (or might want to) take out
Wuoshi ,Fire and Fury and Resolution.

Try doing a /who all 50 60 or /who <guild name> all

Once you identify a member of one of the higher level guilds send them
a tell and let them know Wuoshi is up. If you are lucky they will go
kill him, and you can make a safe CR.
