Since creating a new character a mere few days ago on Stromm, I have gone 
about killing everything I could (including greens) in an effort to sell 
enough loot to raise enough plat to purchase a better weapon than the one 
with which I started. Last night, I had managed to come up with some 31pp 
by questing and hunting - a fair accomplishment, I thought. With that, I 
made haste to the Bazaar to see what I could come up with.

First off, there were more *far* people selling goods in PoK than in the 
bazaar. No matter. I figure as the server matures, that will change. The 
worst part was that the best weapon I could find for sale *anywhere* was 
the forged crap from aspiring blacksmiths. It occurred to me then that no 
one was even high enough level yet to kill the mobs that drop anything 
better. That made perfect sense, so I decided I should save my money and 
wait until these weapons started showing up in auctions.

*However*, I got to wondering. When these better weapons started showing 
up, why would I think I might be content to purchase one once it's 
available, knowing full well that even *better* stuff was right around 
the corner? Especially considering that it will be devalued as soon as 
the newer stuff becomes available. Good God, it's the PC industry all 
over again!!!

Thusfar, this dilemma, the overpopulation of lowbies and the flood of 
obnoxious overuse of /ooc everywhere I turn are really the only downsides 
I have seen. Other than that it is almost like new again...almost.
