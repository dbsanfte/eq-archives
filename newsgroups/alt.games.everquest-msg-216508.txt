According to Furor from FoH, a moderately well known Warrior and guild
leader, not being stunnable gives a warrior attacking from the front 10%
more dps. Every main tank I talked to in our raiding guild before I
started my warrior said if they had it to do again, they'd have made
ogres. As a cleric, the number of times I've seen our main tanks stunned
standing semi-uselessly in front of the mob they are tanking also makes
me believe that the inability to be stunned makes a large difference. I
guess it depends if you plan to get to 65 and keep playing. Almost
everyone I know who's L65 has spent way more time at max level than they
spent getting there. AA isn't penalized racially either, as far as I
know, so for the relatively little amount of time you spend leveling,
the 20% really isn't a big deal, especially with how easy it is to get
experience now with the planes, ldon zones and adjusted group experience
modifiers.

I think a better question is, why do you want to play a warrior?
Currently, especially past L55 or so, playing a warrior is probably one
of the most frustrating roles I've tried in EQ. While understanding how
agro works is invaluable as a warrior, the character is one of the most
gear dependant in the game, making it a huge investment even as the
twink of someone with access to high level zones that drop reasonably
sellable loot. Even with 2 20k weapons (on our server anyway, though
they've dropped since) one sword proc'ing planar stun and whatever the
copper hammer procs, I found at 58 that gaining and holding agro was way
more work than fun. Unless you can afford to buy a BoC (180k on our
server), or have access to raid loot, you will have a tough time gaining
and holding agro compared to either knight class, and if you aren't
going to raid, either knight is usually the prefered class for
experience groups at higher levels anyway. Maybe the new hate proc
augment from the Everfrost vendor will help a bit for this but you're
still reliant on unreliable procs and an unreliable taunt versus the
totally reliable stuns and agro spells of the knighs.

LDoN may fix this to some extent, in that eventually even non raiders
will be able to purchase themselves at least close to VT level gear or
upgrade thier existing gear in other ways. There's an any slot 40hp item
on Rujarkian vendors that can be added to most visible armor, for up to
200hp upgrade to your gear. Sta augments drop reasonably often as well,
and while they're only 6sta on L65 missions, a few can add up if getting
close to max sta is your aim.

Besides, if you asked him now I bet he'd admit to wishing he'd made an
ogre. He certainly sounded like he had ogre envy when talking about the
benefits of not being stunned.
