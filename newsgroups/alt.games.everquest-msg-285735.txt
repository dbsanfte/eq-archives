I don't think they ever stated the reasons for the breakup with MS, beyond 
the vague "we did what we felt was best for the game" routine. They *did*, 
however, tell us straight up that with SoE there at the end it was  all 
about the funding running out.

If the MS breakup was also all about the money, it wouldn't shock me. I 
wouldn't put it past either MS or SoE to try and publish a game like 
Vanguard on the cheap, rather than ensuring that it's finished before 
release.
