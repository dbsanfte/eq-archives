If you are thinking of tradeskill items you might also consider Heady
Kiolas.  These are used to skill up in tailoring.  They are cheap and need a
low skill to make (around 40 I think) but some people would rather buy them
than spend the time making them.  Check the bazaar to see what they sell for
on your server.

Leather padding is another good one.  To make them you need a Low Quality
Pelt and a Silk Thread (made with two spiderling silks) These sell from
20-50 pp each depending on the server.

Buying low and selling high works for some, but you really have to know the
items well and know what the market is for items.  I never had much luck
with it, except for a few items that I was familiar with.  I think the
people that make this work have played the game a long time and really know
the market and items well.
