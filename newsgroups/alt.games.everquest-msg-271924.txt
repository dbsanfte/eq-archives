I did approach quite a few early on as I am a casual player and i enjoyed
being in a  guild in eqlive, but always had problems with raids. I thought
it would be better but couldn't find any casual friendly guilds in my area.

True, but at least in other games, you won't be being harassed by the game
dev's themselves, because they hate soloers. Forced dependence on others is
not fun. Sure, group member should level faster and have better gear, in the
way raiders should be better than groupers, i don't have a problem with
that. There should however, be a way all along for a soloer to have fun. As
a crusader, I have to fight tough gnolls to become a paladin for example,
and i can't solo them, but because people are min/maxing their way to the
top, they don't fight those gnolls.

SOE's philosophy has always been hostile and contemptuous. I remember the
class decription of the monk in eqlive as being "able to solo or fight in
groups equally well" which was still on the web site at the same time that
dev's were posting on forums that monks weren't supposed to be soloing.
Early on in EQ2 soloing works fine for quite a few classes, but then you get
hit with quests that require you to fight mobs that really are tough solo,
like timberclaw gnolls. You can ignore the quests and solo single mobs ad
infinitum but it's the quests which drew me to the game in the first place
and the change in the last patch was the last straw. I was standing in the
forest in antonica besides groups killing stags over and over for days, and
asking to join and kill a few timberclaws as well, and being ignored,
because the feeling was that killing the same mob repetitively was the most
efficient way to leet status. Suck an elf, that's a dull way to play!
Eventually the gnolls started becoming green and i realised that i could
solo through a quest provided i was prepared to wait until the mobs were
grey. That's just insane.
