Well speaking from experience i have the two way system no phone line and
the phone line/ satillite system in the past the lag is very bad on the land
line/ sat but the two way is even worse go with anything else for eq even
the phone line will keep you alive. its great for downloads and surfing the
net but not when your life (game) depends on it
