There are two ways to help with research, first is to dump all of your
practice points into it as soon as you can.  The second is to do the
practice research.  For that you need to give a GLS or something to either
some gypsy in erm one of the karanas or the same thing to one of the DE
merchant/vendors in SRO.  After that you can collect other parts of various
critters to make practice runes which you can attempt to combine in your
research combiner for skill points.  Personally I found it easier to do
the dump practice points on the trainer and just be a research drop hog
and practice on making spells that I already had.  Now, I was a necro and
not a mage so I didn't have to go thru the hell of re-researching old
pets. :)
