Of course, one could mention the Sleeper in the same light, could they not? 
In that case, player gear eventually made success in that encounter 
possible. In the case of these quests which are not broken but just 
obscure, I would say the catalyst could simply be time. Eventually, someone 
could still stumble upon the solution.

I don't know. It just seems to me that not every single quest necessarily 
*needs* to have been solved by now, as long as the solution is actually 
possible and not a case of broken code.
