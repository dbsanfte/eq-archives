Clerics, Shamans, and I also believe Druids and Beastlords get a spell
to cure poison at low levels, and also all get healing spells. Getting
poisoned in a solo fight is very disastrous, but in a group, there
will almost always be someone that can either cure the poison or just
heal it's effects while you continue to beat on the mob.

That is the essence of grouping after all.
