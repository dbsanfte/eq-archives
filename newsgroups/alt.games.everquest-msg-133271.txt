Well, after a week of constant grinding, I've decided to take a break
and do some other stuff.  I was considering working on faction or
tradeskills.  I know eventually I want to do the Prayer Shawl quests, so
I definitely need to up some trade skills.  I haven't gotten my spells
from Shadowhaven so I should probably work on some faction there.  I
also started collecting silks from heart spiders last night, so when I
decided to start on tailoring I'd have a supply.  But then Luclin
tradeskills look very interesting as well.  

As I mentioned I know I need to work on Shadowhaven, what other faction
work would be beneficial to me?

Also as a 27 high-elf cleric what tradeskill would give me the most
benefit, both in the short term and in the long run?
