Don't worry you'll figure out how to play real quick.  I was a totally 
newb when I started.  I hadn't even played D&D, I'd tried to play D&D 
and just never got started at it.

Human warrior sounds like a good choice.  Or maybe a rogue.  Rogues can 
be fun.  Do yourself a favor and don't try bard, they are tough to learn 
on.  Any of the casters requires you to learn about spellcasting but if 
you want: rangers don't get any spells till level 9, gives you some time 
to learn how to control the character before you have to buy it spells.

Go to eq.crgaming.com and look at all the races and classes.  You'll 
find more information there than you can take in at once.

Then go to eqatlas.com/atlas and look at a map of the area that you are 
starting in. Print out the maps if you can, you'll be glad you did.

Then check out everquest.allakhazam.com look for quests by zone link and 
then look for the zone that you are starting in.  You should find the 
newbie quests for your class/race there.  The armor quests are new, I 
didn't have newbie armor to quest for, it's nice.

Good luck
