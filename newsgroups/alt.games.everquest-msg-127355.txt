Sounds good to me! :)  Now if it were -me- doing it, I'd design a whole 
mess of parallel universes, varying little things like the gravitational 
constant and the vacuum permittivity and whatnot, so I could compare how 
they came out.

Which would fit pretty neatly with this rather cool paper I had the 
fortune to read once on the evolution of universes.  Wish I knew what I 
did with it...

The basic idea was that it might be possible, eventually, for a sentient 
race in some universe to figure out how to create universes.  So there'd 
be an evolutionary pressure favoring universes with a sentient species 
being created, snce they'd effectively reproduce themselves.
