It all depends how it pans out - bear in mind its for eq2 so far , too - but
they have said you would ALL get the zones, at least the initial levels of
a multi level dungeon, but that certain content within those zones, such
as given quests, or story based encounters, would only be open to those with
the expansion bought.

I cant decide if I despise SOE for finding yet another way to try and rend money
out of me, or quite like the idea - it will depend, really, on whether these
are truly *story* driven things like RPG modules... if they are, well...

Norraths been missing story for so long now I'd be delighted. Ever since
the space invaders linear progression of POP I stopped loving EQ, and
the release of EQ2 was enough to get me back after OOW had me retire
my accounts.
