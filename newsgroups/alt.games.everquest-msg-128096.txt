is that for real?  100% that happens?   thats fucking STUPID.   I had no
clue about that.. im sure a lot of people didn't (posting maybe wasn't a
good idea) but thats unreal for them to have a "feature" like that.

Were talking about something a lot higher than EQ scams now... and frankly
sounds very unlikely.   Im not saying he didn't "steal" his account details,
but I very much doubt he did it from an AIM conversation.

I remember some old Ezboard dupes a while back.. and it goes without saying
theres probably more out there undiscovered (kept quiet).

If your willing to account share, then its the risk you take and price you
pay I guess (I have sympathy for them, but they ultimately allowed it to
happen to themselves)

I was stuck in PoH before, the 1 wizard had gone out to port another group
up (knowing I had to leave asap, it was 7am and i was already late for work)
and then had to arse about buying a hate stone etc... eventually I had to
camp out inside PoH (not really good, as a melee) a guildie told me to give
him my password and he'd get me out when the wizard returned.

Thanks but no thanks..

A few weeks ago I had to camp tormax... a few times a guildie has camped
him, given their info to me or another person (I have about 7 peoples
accounts, at a guess).. anyway 1 hour sleep in 2 days (16 hours of work, 1
hour sleep, 31 hours camping him)  on the last day, I came home form work to
continue the camp, to find out he died less than 2 hours prior.

I was gutted and pissed.. but in no way did my opinion change about getting
a friend/guildie to log me in.  Its not just about trust (yes there are some
people I trust in-game, and I trust most if not all my guildies).. its just
me, and thats not a risk im prepared to take.

I was totally disheartened by the tormax thing and took a week off EQ (my
first non-vacation break heh) but i still wasn't gonna give my info out to
somebody, so I could continue "a normal life".

The week after, in talks with a guildie on ICQ (and no intentions of
playing) and tormy popped mid-conversation...  guess patience is the key :)

I've seen and read stories though, a guild wipes.. 1 person has to log, so a
guildie offers to log them in for a summon corpse..  the person logs in to
find their account stripped/deleted/password changed.

He sounds like a complete piece of shit.. good luck in resolving it ;/
