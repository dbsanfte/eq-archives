Mmm. And I would expect end product items to hold up - as tradeskill societies
level up , however, the washes and oils become available from the wholesaler,
effectively destroying a high value market for intermediate products... or is
there some cap on what becomes available? As a 19 outfitter I dont make my
own washes (although I could) , its too annoying. I just buy my eolinth
tempers, stroma washes, etc, from the NPC dealer.
