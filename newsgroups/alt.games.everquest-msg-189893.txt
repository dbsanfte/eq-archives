Exactly.

Perhaps a 100% taunt isn't the way to go, but warriors need *something*.

Maybe a skill that generates the aggro of a stun without generating any
other effect? Basically something that acts the way many people think
Taunt *actually* acts, with an aggro hit of a particular amount amount,
and the level of the skill controlling the amount of the aggro hit.

That would not be unbalancing; the smaller HP of the knight classes is
compensated by some form of self-heal and by damage avoiding spells
(root, stun, fear, snare) so what is mainly needed is some way of
approximating their aggro generation capabilities.

One possibility is for the existing Warrior Taunt to have a +aggro effect
*before* the skill check. SKs/Paladins could perhaps get a similar effect,
muted down a little.
