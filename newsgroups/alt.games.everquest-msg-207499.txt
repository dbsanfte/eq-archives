 Yeah we killed him and it was pretty fun. He dropped 3 items. One of
them was the boots. A single group can kill anything there. At 65 the
only non-blue I saw was Korocust. I'd guess he was level 70 maybe. He
had a lot of HP but overall a big wuss.

 Sounds a bit lame to me. As least with extended affliction it would
always do the sme damage. It should never be random each tick in my
opinion. Either a coding screwup or a definite nerf. I leave that for
you to determine.
