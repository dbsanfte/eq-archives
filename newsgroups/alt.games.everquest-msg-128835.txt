Yes... AND me. And we wouldn't have HAD all those fucking corpses for
you to summon if somebody hadn't decided it would be a neat idea to pull
the shammy epic mob after I'd already TL'd half the raid force out and
was just memming gate myself.  The sad part was his partner posting to
our guild boards later and saying "well, at least it was still fun to
try."

I memmed gate and was just standing up when I got hit with some
UNFUCKINGGODLY AoE and went down in a pile of robes and burnt erudite
steaks.

/sigh
