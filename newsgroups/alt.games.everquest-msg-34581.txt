If you're hunting spiderlings, all you'll get will be spiderling silk.
This is used in tailoring, but the utility of it is fairly limited,
compared to full grown Spider Silks.

I've been having good luck lately hunting the Carrion Spiders in East
Karana. In my experience, they drop more silks than the tougher Crag
Spiders, and are killable with just a Root and a DoT. The spiders in
Guk are said to drop pretty well, and are relatively uncamped. And
I've had some luck running around South Ro cleaning up all the
unlooted dead stuff from the guilds trying to make the AC spawn. Keep
the silks, sell all the junk to the guy in the NW corner, and make
enough cash to pay for the next round of Heady Kiolas you're going to
have to make.

Useless for tailoring. Sorry.

Hehe. The best advice I can give involves considerable amounts of
alcoholic beverages. Especially when you get to the Wu's Armor. The
hosts of heaven will weep for you then.

>Looks like Cured silk is the way to go

Assorted random stuff will get you from 29 to 41. You'll want to print
some recipe lists and keep them handy, as you'll have to juggle a lot
of stuff depending on the ingredients you come across, but at least it
lets you put off Cured Silk.

I'm advising putting off Cured Silk until you've exhausted some of the
other stuff because it's annoying. Making Heady Kiolas is a pretty
fast way to put yourself into a coma. I've made many hundreds of them,
so I know wherefor I speak.

I don't have anything like that, you're right. I mention where some of
the rarer stuff (like the Velious components) can be found, but I
don't go into details as to what zones are best. Primarily that's
because on occasions where I've tried, I get a handful of e-mails
telling me that I'm wrong, and zone X is better.
