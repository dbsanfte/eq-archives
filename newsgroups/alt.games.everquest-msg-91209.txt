Hi all
A lot of things have been said about the effect of charisma on some
enchanters spells.
I would like to have an answer from enchanters, based on experience.

My question is about mez spells.
Those spells have a fixed duration, then charisma cant affect the duration.
I have noticed that my level, the level of the mob and the MR of the mob i
try to mez are very important for a mez to land. i.e. when i tash, mez lands
easyer. when the mob is blue, mezzing is easyer than when it is yellow.

But, when i raise my charisma with 75 more points (gear and buff), i dont
notice any difference :-(
So ? Are 75 more points not enough to notice a difference ? Or am i blind ?

I am level 44, so i dont know about high level game.

Any advice welcome.
