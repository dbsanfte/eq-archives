> What's everyone think?

It is a solution looking for a problem. People buying and selling plat has
very little effect on players at the high end where almost everyone is now.

Gear at the high end requires raiding, raiding requires guild and or
friends, guild and or friends if selling plat are doing so to further
raiding.

I.E. the only people overly upset about it are those who are not twinks
rasing up a character for the first time and getting looked over for what
they consider is poor gear but what is more probably poor attitude and lack
of skill.
