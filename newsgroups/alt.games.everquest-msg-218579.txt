MY BAD for saying "genetic issues" without further qualification.
I thought people would read & understand that to mean severe
genetic issues (as determined by one or more qualified doctors)
along with a high risk of passing it onto their children (as determined
by one or more qualified doctors).  In addition, I don't really want
anybody shot (I don't believe in murder).  Lastly, parents who don't
*know* about the severe genetics issues obviously can't be blamed (for
example, two carriers who don't show symptoms themselves).

I can see where my original message came off wrong.  My apologies.
If you knew me, you'd probably have know *immediately* what I meant;
in this anonymous and public forum, I can see I made a terrible
mistake by making that comment without fleshing it out very carefully.

I'm not a bad person.  Really.
