Knockback = movement.   Movment = Spell interruption.

Better than stun, even... if it works on unstunnable mobs.

Bah, this will do little for small race warriors.  You can start acquiring
these skills at 51.   At 55, you get the ability to stun with kicks naturally,
so why go through an extra post 50 level for the same thing?    Little
benefit.

Where it will really be desired is by non - large race Paladins /
Shadowknights, since they do not get the kick ability.

Why not?   Fear *spells* never hit me anyways.   I note that they didn't say
anything at all about making you immune to dragon roar (which is the important
one).
