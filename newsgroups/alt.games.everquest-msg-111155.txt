That is true, however I don't exactly see Christians being persecuted here
in the US.  I know there are places in the world where they are, but the US
is not one of those places.  John Ashcroft was not grilled because he is a
Christian, it was due to which side of a number of issues he is on.  There
are many Christians who do not agree with him and his viewpoints.
