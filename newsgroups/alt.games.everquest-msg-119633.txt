From the official Planes of Power site:

"Players of all levels will benefit from the Plane of Knowledge
that hosts scores of new quests and opens portals to Norrath
making travel easier than ever."

Off-hand, I'd say they set up Luclin as they did for whatever
reason, possibly having something to do with both "protecting"
the new race's low-level hunting grounds as well as the general
"time-sink" nature of higher-level encounters in the expansion.

The intent, apparently, for the Plane of Knowledge seems to be
basically eliminating that type of problem for lower-level players
as well as providing more quests.   Everything I've heard about
it focuses on it being (as well as whatever quests it hosts) being
a true, Norrath-wide portal.
