   I know you're talking to Graeme here, but I hope he won't be too mad at
me for jumping in.  Does one join EQ2 serverwide the same as in EQ Live? 
Or would it be something like /join eqII.serverwide.age:age ?  And does the
/autojoin function work the same way as in EQL?  Thanks for any answers I
might get.

Tealeaf-- Ogre Priest on AB
