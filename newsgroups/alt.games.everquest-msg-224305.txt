This is almost always the case.  Enrage does not happen until the very end
of the fight, so even 10 seconds of not attacking doesn't kill you. Your
hate procs have not been forgotten about, nor all the other damage you've
built up.

Riposted hits won't build aggro.  All that would do is hurt you.  Best
option is to just stop attacking.   If it spins to someone else, AE taunt
it.   If AE taunt isn't available, then start smacking it in the back and
taunt immediately.

It's kind of odd, but for all the hundreds of times I've seen boss mobs
enrage, I don't think I've ever seen an actual wipe happen becasue of it.
Worst that usually happens is a couple melees that weren't paying enough
attention get a sharp lesson.    In the extreme rare case you might have
your MT bite it, and a few other tanks die.. but by then almost anything can
be blasted down by the casters.

If I evade when enrage goes off, and repeat as it refreshes, my rogue can
generally attack through the entire enrage without gaining aggro.
