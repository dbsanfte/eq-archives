    I'm surprised he didn't reflexively respond, "I'm sorry, but I'm rather
busy right now." ;-)

    If you have SoW, JBoot effect, etc. then you can always move no matter
how encumbered. As long as Richard was in a zone where he could activate the
JBoots when he realized he was encumbered, that is. I've had to help so many
people stuck in Shadow Haven with loads of sacks and no way out....

    A true caster! "1" is Sit on all of my casters, too.
