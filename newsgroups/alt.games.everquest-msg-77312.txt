Seems we are trying to read more into this than necessary.  The original

So, if taken at its face value it adds 5% to the meditation SKILL not 
directly to mana regeneration.  Whether this means +5 meditation skill 
points or +(meditation skill times 0.05) is what is in question, IMHO.  What 
exactly does VI mean by +5%.  It may even be visible on those people that 
have mastered the skill (skill level greater than 100, say 120 or better,  
but well less than the  250+ cap) by looking at the personal information 
screen under skills with the item equipped and de-equipped to see the 
difference in the meditation skill.  If no difference is noted then VI 
probably forgot to implement the reporting feature.
