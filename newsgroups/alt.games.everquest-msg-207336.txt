I guess this is where we have a basic disagreement. I don't see where
there's a whole lot of skill involved in most CRs, they're an
annoyance nothing else (I'm talking party wipeouts here). At best, you
send in your monk/SK/Necro/rogue to drag the corpses to a safe place,
at worst you have to bug a friend to summon your corpses out. I just
don't see either of those as being particularly challenging and fun
for the group. A 90%+ rez is a given anyway so it's not like an exp
hit is gonna hurt. 

In the 55+ game, you just don't do old fashioned CRs with gear that
you happen to have in the bank. Those places, almost w/o exception, if
you wiped in your best gear, you aren't gonna be able to get back with
3rd rate gear.
