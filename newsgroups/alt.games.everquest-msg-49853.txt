Thanks for this.

This weekend we discovered another way to earn a lot of plat.

My wife and I started two new Barbarians on Cazic-Thule.  In Everfrost,
killing polar bear cubs for pelts seems to be very lucrative.  The medium
and low
quality pelts were selling for 4-10pp, while the high quality were selling
for 45pp.   We only spent a portion of our time killing bears,  mostly
while travelling.  Maybe we
were just lucky, but between the two of us, we got about 5 hq pelts
and about 15 lq and mq pelts (plus about 50 or so ruined, which
would make a great start for a budding tailor that didn't want to
spend practice points on tailoring).  So now our bank accounts are
sitting at 90pp and 160pp.  Wee!  That's more plat than my 15th lvl
bard had at once (of course she blows a lot working on smithing, having
Int and Wis in the range of a dolt).

There also seem to be a lot of generous people on that server.  People
kept offering us better and better armor and weapons.  So now we
have a nearly 8th level rogue and a 9th level shaman, and we are kicking
those nasty vengeful skeletons boney butts (well, ok, we're almost dead
by the time they crumble, heh).  We even took down a mammoth calf
by ourselves!

I hadn't played a rogue before, but they are definitely fun.  Hide and sneak
are fun to goof around with.  I haven't really figure out how to use them in
combat yet, as they really aren't reliable for me yet (skill 40 in each).

As I ramble on here, I played with pick pocketing a little and got 1 copper.
Yay.  Is this worth spending time at?  I found just one NPC in Halas who
wasn't red to me, to pick pockets, but I'm afraid if she starts attacking
me,
I won't make it to the zone line (would have to swim!) before she kills me.
Maybe I'll try pick pocketing gnoll pups or scouts.
