1) I put you in my killfile for a reason. Kindly stop squirming out of
it.

2) You and Bizbee don't need a debate, you just both need to shut up
and ignore one another. Bizbee apparently has you in his killfile, why
don't you put him in yours?

3) I don't care if you don't want others posting to this thread. You
want a private playground, go start your own news server.

So sayeth the master.

And your behavior. And all of those who are residents of so many kill
files.

Gosh, now if only you were so competent at ignoring Bizbee, we'd be on
to something interesting.
