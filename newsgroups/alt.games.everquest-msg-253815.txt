Short answer - no.

Long answer - No, because the software is all theoretically downloadable
if you know how (see Google for past threads on how to get the patcher and
go from there) or simply use another set of disks to install. The 
important part in the box is that key which you need to set up the access
account (its not like a normal CD key that allows you to validate a piece
of software on the clientside)  and which you need a new game box which
covers the same areas you want to play. If Sony sell Keys only, or
electronically transmit a key  from their online store anywhere then that
would allow you to use the disks you have (but the game will autodownload
and update a lot of it anyway) - however last time this went round I
believe the answer came that such a product wasnt on their website.

Basically a second hand EQ box with no unused key aint worth much beyond a
handy set off reinstall disks if you lose the others.
