I play a beastlord, and have to say that I think the combination sounds
very workable. Beastlords are considered some of the better soloers in
the game, with the only weaknesses being crowd control, reliable
stunning, and keeping the bastards from running. A druid covers all
three of those bases. A druid's DPS is from nukes, as I understand it.
This works great with a BL who prefers the 'pet cleric' style of play.
Druids have good healing output; this is great for the BL who prefers to
get in there and trade blows with the mob. Beastlords have slows, albeit
not as nice as chanter or Shammy.

Overall, I think it would be a very workable pairing. Maybe not as
strong on CC and such as a mage/chanter pairing or whatnot, but better
than many duos. There are not many situations this duo couldn't handle,
and even those are doable with more effort.

But, I am biased as I play a beastlord, and the things that make me
hate soloing as one would be perfectly complemented by a druid. :)
