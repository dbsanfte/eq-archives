Actually, I quickly found a work-around.  Just use an illusion mask.  I 
didn't realize until I read here that you could then duck out of it, 
making it only a 1 second issue, rather than a 6 second issue.  I think 
your bards just aren't quite as addicted as some of us.  (We had 3 of 4 
bards on from 8pm until I logged at midnight, bitching and casting 
illusion the whole time.)
