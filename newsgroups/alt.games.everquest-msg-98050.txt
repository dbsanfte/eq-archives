Don't play with a lot of bards, do you? :-)
Our guild only has three chanters over 50, and they are in high demand
and play from different time zones. When I have crowd control, it's
usually a bard, and they can do a fine job. However, most of the time we
rely on tank mezzing and rooting. Believe it or not, you can play a lot
of dungeons with no chanter or bard if you are careful and use good
strategy. I tank mez when I'm the *only* tank! And it works.

Depending on the dungeon's xp modifier, this is often the case already.
In the entry at the Hole, all but a very few of the elementals are light
blue at 55. But the old xp bar still moves better there than almost
anyplace else. And yes, I can *sometimes* solo a single one of them if
I'm at full health, but usually they can kill me or leave me near dead
at the end of the fight.

I think some of your suggestions (mostly snipped for brevity, sorry) are
kind of game unbalancing and not "doable" but I think this one has some
merit. Perhaps giving the shammies a no xp rez in their late thirties,
and a 50% around fifty wouldn't be the end of the world for clerics. It
would seem more fair from a game-play perspective for some of those
non-clerical races. Of course, if we give it to the shammies, we'd have
to give it to the druids as well, so I'd veto it just on those grounds.
