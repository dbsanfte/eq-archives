Because the night is about 3 hours long and the day is about 5 minutes 
long. Or am I the only one who notices this? :)  As I mentioned somewhere 
else in this thread, I'm VERY impatient.  I don't like sitting down and 
juggling spells.  I like to have a specific setup and leave it like that.  
For a very, very, VERY long time.  (Which is why I'd SO love it if Verant 
would allow, as somebody once suggested, TWO sets of pre-memmed spells.)
