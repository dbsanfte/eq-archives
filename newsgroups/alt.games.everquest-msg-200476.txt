No, you'll get no aggro in PoK from training brass.  I usually park my
bard(s) next to Virtuoso Legilwan (bard trainer), as it seems fitting
that he should be the recipient of my practice sessions.  AIUI you do
need something for the song to be acting on, so if you use DDD you'll
need to be within range of an NPC.
