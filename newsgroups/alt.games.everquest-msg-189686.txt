I started a vah shir beastlord and have found it to be an excellent and fun
solo character at least through the mid 20s. In the late 20s soloing wasn't
as effective, but now that I've got the lvl30 spells and pet its going great
solo again.

What I like about the beastlord solo as opposed to chanter or necro is the
versatility of the playing experience. Sometimes I'm right in there fighting
the mob with the warder, sometimes I'm playing pet-cleric, sometimes I'm
acting as an offensive caster (dotting and slowing), and I do a fair amount
of shammy-type buffing...I find it more interesting than playing either a
pure caster or a pure tank class.

But anyway the original poster didn't ask about beastlords or bards or
chanters. To the original question, I think the poster would enjoy a necro a
bit more than a mage, just from his comments and my observation of those
classes.
