And boy's soccer teams in middle America outnumber girl's soccer
teams. That doesn't mean the girls aren't having fun when they play.

I don't disagree at all that PvP games are generally less popular than
PvE. That doesn't mean they are not fun to the folks that play them,
nor that they're not a valid form of gaming. But let's not absurdly
dismiss them simply based on a numbers comparison - the world is full
of enjoyable activities that relatively small numbers of people engage
in.
