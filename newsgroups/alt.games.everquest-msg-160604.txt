I'm a level 50 cleric and I'd like to solo Kael to get some armor. I'm not
sure if I can do it yet but I'd like to start whenever possible.

I notice that the first giant by the door is green and the ones at the first
gate are light blue. I've heard that the giants at the bank drop armor.

Since I'll be needing to sit quite a bit to med up I'm wondering if there
are any safe spots to sit on the way to the bank (from EW)?

Also, do all the giants drop the armor or just the ones farther in?
