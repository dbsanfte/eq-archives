Not all sushi involves raw fish. Sushi is vinegared rice plus
something else. The most popular things to combine with sushi are
slices of raw seafood, but there is also the roe, smoked seafood,
deep-fried things, vegetables, eggs etc.

There are two basic schemes for combining the rice and the something:

Nigiri - the something on top of the rice
Maki -  wrapping the rice and the "something" in seaweed (usually a
roll sliced into rounds)
Te-maki - A large sheet of seaweed wrapped into a cone and filled with
rice and the "something"

Sashimi is sliced raw fish with rice usually served on the side.
