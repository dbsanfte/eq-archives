Back in good old Paladul this morning, (the -only- person in zone!) I
went in and started soloing B1.  With no good way to single pull,
eventually I got a little over my head and had to run up towards
zone.  There I managed to root park a couple of the mobs so I could
kill the other two, heal up a bit and kill the rooted ones.  By now
there were some other people in the zone, I'd called out an offer to
share a few times to no avail.  I'd called the train as I moved out
of the B1 area, and now apologized about the train, explained that
I'd killed them all, and asked again if anyone wanted to join me.

Got a tell from someone who said -he- was over soloing B2 all alone.
Yep, another shaman.  At any rate, we decided it would be more fun to
team up, and we could get more of the full spawn (neither he or I was
actually killing all our mobs before repop) so I went over and joined
him.  He was a 23 barb shaman to my 22 troll, we were both sporting
KEI.  There was a marked difference in our ability to tank, though,
my hp bar dropped a lot more slowly than his on the same mobs,
frequently I ended up sponge while he tried to avoid the aggro.

Slowly we gathered more for our group, a bard, a mage, cleric, and
chanter; this group really tore thru the mobs.  I was again puller
and MA, with chanter mezzing and everyone assisting me, the only
trouble was we were wasting mana regen; DOTs weren't worth casting
because mobs died too fast, other than whatever I'd pull with I
really wasnt casting at all, would have probably been FM with no mana
regen at all; only expenditure was on healing the mage and chanter
occaisionally if the cleric got in trouble.

I quite frequently called the cleric to task for healing me; as long
as I was over 80% HP it just seemed a waste of mana, particularly
when he'd then cry out "10M"!  Probably didn't have KEI, but that
aside, simple observation should have told him I really wasn't in any
danger at 80%, and was regenning HP fast enough that unless I had at
least three mobs on me I wasn't losing any at all.  The second shaman
had hit 24 by now and put Regen on me, plus the bard HP regen song, I
calculated my standing HP regen at 25 per tic roughly.

Funny aside, the bard got aggro like mad, and almost always from the
female mobs.  I could pull two males and get them both, when I pulled
a male and a female added, she'd go for him like lightning!  We
surmised they liked his look; full lambent, old school!   So thats
where a lot of the cleric mana was going.  Once we got the chanter in
this problem largely dissapeared, killing one mob at a time is so
much simpler.

There was quite a lot of flux in this group, one moving out and
another in, group size went back and forth between three and six.
Most of the time, though, we were killing every mob before repop,
realistically we should have perhaps moved to another zone, but with
a group ranging 17 to 25, where better to go for exp, even if you
could handle harder mobs?

Again I found I made a very good sponge, while other classes were
certainly knocking out more damage, we didn't get anyone in that
could stand up to a beating better, up to and including a couple 22
paladins.  After we lost the cleric and the other shaman it still
ended up working better to let me take most of the beating, and only
have the paladins steal it if I needed to heal one of the finger
wrigglers.  I picked up my new spells and memed a couple, keeping
Regen on everyone helped make up for the lack of an active healer.

Other than that I didnt really try out the new goodies, in fact I
didn't get half of them (trip to Everfrost ones) till afterwards.
Canna takes 50 HP per pop, with KEI this wasn't necessary but it was
interesting to toy with.  I might be missing something, but overall a
pretty unexciting upgrade set, other than Regen and Canna.  No new
slow, no haste... push to 29 I say!
