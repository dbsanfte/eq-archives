Not necessary, the unflagged could have just logged back in after camping 
out, and all rejoined the raid once all the unflagged were 85/15ed in to 
Sol Ros chamber.

While it's a major pain in the butt, you can get more unflagged in to the 
elemental zones, you just need to get 15% in, have them die, and then 
/corpsedrag them, and hope the dragger does not die.  Alternatively, 
corpse summoning can be used after the God is killed, or CoTH, just 
depends which God it is as to which method needs to be employed.  For 
Coirnav, CoTH works, for Xegony corpse summoning, for FRo, I believe 
corpse summoning works, and no clue on RC.  RC is more of a pain, as it 
is in EarthB.

Mind you coordinating the corpse summoning/rezzing/hailing gets to be a 
pain if the numbers are too large, but it's doable for a few people 
without any real trouble, just have to be sure to die near the zonein, 
after joining a group with a necro/SK right after, or shortly before the 
God dies.
