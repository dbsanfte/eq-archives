As I see it, you have a bit of a problem.  You want to join a pickup
group, which means going where lots of people congregate.
Unfortunately, wherever lots of people congregate, Very Stupid People
are going to predominate, and Very Stupid People don't understand what
a necro can bring to a group; they think they're weird and icky.
They'd much rather have two tanks, a nuking ranger, a cleric, a
chanter, and of course a shammy for those l33t, useless stat buffs.

If I were you I think I'd hit DL and try to find one or two partners
from among the outcasts.  Another necro and perhaps a despondent druid
would make a nice little trio.

Failing that, if you have Luclin, you could try to get a Rockhopper
group in Dawnshroud Peaks.
