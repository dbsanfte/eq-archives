I've gotten it several times with different toons...  Usually, it's
placeholder will be a named crypt mummy mob standing inside a small
tower... Keep it dead as well as all other undead mobs you see... Not
sure if it's on the same cycle, but killing spiders also seems to make
the AC, Terrorantula, Sand Giant, or Hussien pop faster... Even if
not, farming the silk is a good was to waste time.  I think the
average time for me to get it to spawn is 2 or 3 hours with the above
mentioned mobs appearing in bursts...
