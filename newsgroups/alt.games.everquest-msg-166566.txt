    I decided to see how much of an effect KEI has on a low-level character.
So I took my shaman twink to Dawnshroud to solo Zelniaks. Her standard
method is to slow, apply one Envenomed Breath on "a zelniak", two Envenomed
Breaths on "a large zelniak", two Envenomed Breaths and a nuke on "a wolf",
and then melee with pet using her 12/19, 81 DD proc spear.

    I'm never going back.

    My level 35^H^H36^H^H37^H^H38 shaman flew through the levels, with
almost no med time required (30 minutes up time per 5 minutes med time at
lower levels, 100% up time by level 38). I'd estimate I saved 2 hours per
level gained (normal XP rate is close to 1 hour per yellow soloing), at a
total cost of 225 pp for KEI. I got trained by Fungi, tried to beat it, and
died when it snared me or else that would be 150 pp total cost. Tonight
after raiding if I'm not too tired I'll get one more shot of KEI, blow
through the 3 or so yellows left in 38, and scribe my new spells (new slow,
DoT, and regen, woo-hoo!).

    James
