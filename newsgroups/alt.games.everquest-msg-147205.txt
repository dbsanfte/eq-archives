What do you think about all these "casinos" that are popping up in the
bazaar?

And, how do you think GM's are dealing with some of the problems they are
causing?  Several times now I've seen shouts/ooc's from people who were
ripped off by a player who took their money but didn't give them their
winnings.  I can't imagine a GM getting involved in this, it just really
opens a can of worms and doesn't fit with past policy.

Lately I've been turining off auction when I go into the bazaar so I don't
have to be bothered with the steady stream of Casino, Casino, Casino and
so-and-so rolled this and that, but it's starting to go to ooc.  I hoped
this concept would die, but it seems a lot of people are enjoying it and
lot's of people are making money this way.
