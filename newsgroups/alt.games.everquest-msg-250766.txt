If there are no mobs nearby, another way you can check to see if hide
worked is to do a /target <your_toons_name>.  So if your toons name is
Wiley, you do

/target wiley

If it says, "I don't see anyone around here with that name.", hide was
successful.  Otherwise, if it targets you, it was not successful.
