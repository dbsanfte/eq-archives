Isn't that what Evade, FD, and Jolt are for?

And yes, I've been on several uberguild raids
(as well as my own alt's guild raids), where the
warrior never lost aggro once, even without
evading.   Something to do with using fast
weapons with hate-intensifying procs as
well as building up sufficient aggro before
calling the rest of us in to assist...
