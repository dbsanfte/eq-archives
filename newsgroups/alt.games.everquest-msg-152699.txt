I don't agree with that statement at all. When I started playing EQ
I kept a wishlist of things I wanted to see changed or added to EQ
and periodically updated and sent that wishlist in to the EQ developers.
To date about 90% of those wishes have made it into the game.
I also see a lot of ideas taken right from the class specific user message
boards. I even see Verant posts to those boards, so they are reading
and considering user ideas and requests.
