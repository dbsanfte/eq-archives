This is what happens when stupid people don't understand the advantage
of using the internet over real life in social situations. Case in
point:

Yeah, the gals on his server are begging for ports to get near him.
It would be bad anyway, but that t-shirt REALLY makes it as does the
sign he is making ahaha.

Its a 3d avatar roleplaying game where you ARE the wood elf druid
naughty girl. If you want to be a guy with a "fucking fuck" t-shirt
you do that in real life everyday.

AAHHAHAHA OMG this guy knows exactly what he is and is in fact
embracing it publically:

That takes enough guts and self esteem that it impresses me. Ahaha how
appropriate he plays a troll.

Half of the posters don't seem to get the point and include no
pictures at all or cigarette packages with "MARIJUANA" very CLEVERLY
written on them.

Thanks for some laughs.
