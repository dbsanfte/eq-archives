Haha, my email address isn't munged. That's my actual email address. I
figure if an actual person was looking over the email addresses they
are harvesting they would reject it out of hand. I mean look at it, no
sane person would have that address. Then if an automated program was
harvesting, it would try to demung it, removing a required part. This
is my "I know I'm going to get spam on this account" account. It's a
permanent account that I expect to get spam on.

I have my main account which I don't give out to anyone except family
and friends, and a number of temporary accounts I make and then delete
just to sign up for things that will result in a lot of spam, but
don't require a long term presence. I've been doing tech support for
so long, I decided to put some of my own anti-spam advice into effect.
So far it's been working out ok, I get less spam on my public account
than I get on my private one, simply because my private one is easy
enough to come up with from a random generator.

That being said, I don't check my spam/public account very often, once
a week or so. Send me an email if you like, I'll get it eventually.
Though I have emailed you as requested.
