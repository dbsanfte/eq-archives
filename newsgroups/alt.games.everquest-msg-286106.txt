Well, it could be worse.  My wife plays Star Wars: Galaxies and
apparently the last couple of times she brought up the launcher for
that game, there was a banner message that said that the servers were
down.  She finally just tried to connect... and bingo, got in.
Apparently SOE just didn't bother changing the message.
