I've suggested ML strategy before.  Nobody seems to like the idea :/ *I* 
sure do, it does exactly what you say - lets me PP without worrying 
about splitting every so often.  And I have two weight reduction bags, 
which helps even more with drops and such.

I've noticed a real flaw in the looting system though.  Everybody claims 
they're not interested in loot as long as autosplit is on, and the first 
time a fine steel weapon drops, BAM, every person is up and after it. :/  
I really don't understand the problem with just sticking with 
alpha/master.
