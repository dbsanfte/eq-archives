    I deleted my 1st primary at level 27 (hie wiz w/ 97 base int) in
hindsight I wish I never did. Although  this was on a blue server where I
could have had multiple characters (yes I'm a dumbass). But mages aren't
that sucky or weak so if he has a well rolled character on his hands my
advice to him would be to hang on to it.
