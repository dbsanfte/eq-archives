I must wonder, then, why you are concerned with what the left does.  Since
you seem to say that you tend to be more towards the right, ideologically,
wouldn't it make more sense to try to find your home there?  After all, if
it's the personalities that torque you off, the left has just as many
jackasses as the right, and the lefts tend to be more self-rightous these
days, to boot.
