Thats all well and good, but some of hav to group, and im not taking my
cleric over to stonebrunt and shouting for a group for says and getting
nowhere. As ive said before, the popular zones are popular, largely because
they are popular. People go where the masses go because its easy to find a
group.

No doubt its the ease of huntng that makes for the initial trend. Oasis has
non social, non agro mobs with no special abilities (crocs). Loio has tons
of stuff, no special abilities, and all around the same level so theres nice
fast pulling at the right level. SK has lots of non agro non faction mobs,
which arnt casters.

Id say the reason we have too many underutilized zones, is that we have too
many zones, period.
