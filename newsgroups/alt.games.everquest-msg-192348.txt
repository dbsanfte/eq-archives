My wife (Beastlord) and I (Enchanter) were pulling Toilers to the zone
edge in ME last night. I had a charmed Toiler as a pet and my wife had
her Pet up (obviously :).

After about half an hour our pets finished off a Toiler but didn't
return to us. Upon going down to investigate we found they were
attacking each other. Mine was still charmed and both responded briefly
to the 'Pet Back off' button before leaping straight back on each other
again.

No prob thought I, I'll mem blur my pet, invis and then we can kill it
and I'll charm another.

When I invised the charm broke but instead of attacking the Toiler my
wife's pet started attacking me! Again, it responded to the 'Pet back
off' command for a brief instant and then leapt back onto me.
Fortunately I had Aego on me and had enough HP to run to the DSP zone
shouting train messages along the way in case I picked up any adds.

I don't believe either pet had been charmed by anything as there were
no other mobs in the vicinity and both pets obeyed our 'Pet Back off'
commands, albeit only briefly.

Any ideas on what could of happened or do you guys think it was a bug? I
reported it with /bug anyway cos it seemed like one to me. We have never
seen anything like this before.
