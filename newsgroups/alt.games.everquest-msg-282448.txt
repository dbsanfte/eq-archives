If you're so stupid as to fail to make such a basic distinction, thus
making yourself sound like a total nutcase in the process, you'll have
to get used to standing aside and letting the better educated amongst
us show you your errors.

Yes, you are - you can't differentiate between "the east/southest of
the USA found it offensive" and "would have found it offensive if they
had read it" until it's pointed out to you. God help you, YOU don't
seem to be aware of what you are "aware" of, at least not based on
your writing skills.  The only reason you didn't choose to "let it
slide" was apparently because "they" found it "offensive". Even
weirder, you evidently seem to think *I* have to interpret your
incoherent messages for you, in order to arrive at what you actually
tried and failed to say properly in the first place. Sorry, not my
job. Try and stay focussed and write what you mean next time, since
you purport to put such store in perceived meanings.

I look forward to your next blatherings with anticipatory amusement.
If (and it's a big "if") you manage to post something next time that
isn't as pompous as is your norm, or larded with your latest, trite,
cringe-making homilies, I might reply to it. I actually might even
reply if you merely manage to sort what *actually* happened instead of
what you *imagined* actually happened.  As it is, from the waffle,
bluster and all the rewriting of what you meant/didn't mean to say,
you are evidently all talked out on the subject of bizbee's supposed
gaffe.
