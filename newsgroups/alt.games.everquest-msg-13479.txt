This kinda popped into my head after reading your post.

I have of late and wherefore I know not, lost all of my mana, forgone
all chances of experience and indeed it goes so heavily with my
disposition that this goodly frame, Norrath, seems to me just sterile
pixles, this most excelent canopy, the sky, look you, this brave
orhanging firmament, this majestical roof filled with planes and gods,
seems to me a foul congregation of vapours.  What a piece of work is
man, how noble in wisdom, how infinate in corpse runs, in hacking and
slashing how express and admirable, in healing how like a paladin, in
snaring how like a god.  The beauty of the world.  The paragon of
MOBs.  An yet to me what is this quintessence of electrons?  No, PCs
delight not me, no, nor NPCs neither, though by your smiling you seem
to say so.
