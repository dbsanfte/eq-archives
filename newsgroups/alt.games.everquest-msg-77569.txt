This has really helped my zone times no doubt.

I already had the other two lines changed, mind you, just added in the
Umbra line.

HOWEVER this has not helped framerates at all and appears to have
actually obliterated them in some places (netherbian lair comes
immediately to mind).

I'm waffling on keeping it in. The fast zoning is nice, it feels like
EQ of old again. But framerates are bad enough without complicating
things even more. I have to look at the ground just to get through
netherbian lair.
