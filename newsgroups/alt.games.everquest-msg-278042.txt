 Well...as expected, there's plenty of buffage. Some more
opportunities for groupage under 65, though not as many
as before EQ2 and WoW. But, if I want to get something
done with one of my main stable of characters, I can.
  Mostly I've been working on Celune. Lower Guk was
actually fun at 46; undead falling fast to nukes, KEI keeping
me down there for long periods, armor configured for tanking
giving Celune survivability against three or four at once.
Now, however, it's likely the Planes for her, unless there are
groups in Karnor's these days.
  I don't want to spend much time on Grukyn, but something
about the ease of playing a beastlord just keeps drawing me
back. Now that he's 38, I just have to push for 39 and see
what new DPS the next pet brings.
  On Drinal, Cadwen has gotten his starter funds from some
high quality pelts; at least SOE had the good sense to raise
the drop rates on these. Now Cadwen can afford all his spells,
if he can find them, and go straight to the next spell level.
  I do worry about the lack of skillups to melee skills. By 15,
Cadwen should have had Piercing up to 50, but it lags around
30. If it's like this for melee classes, this could be game-breaking.
SOE had better fix it fast of there will be no new melees made
to replace retiring ones, and the high end content will slowly
become undoable.
  Invictvs is haveing trouble getting elemental god spawns.
We want to do Xegony, to finally get her dead and most of us
Time flagged, but other guilds have the jump on us; we may end
up on-call and ready to race for a spawn for a while. Possibly
exciting times...
