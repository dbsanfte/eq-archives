Hmm, I do beleive monopolizing spawns that grant no xp and denying
others who obviously can get xp from them is considered zone
disruption and is petitionable. The instance where he attacked the one
your "noob" benefactor was fighting is DEFINATELY petitionable.

One thing if you don't want to involve a GM/guide, do a /guildstatus
on the guy, check his guild, and ask another member for an officer.
I've gotten a few people kicked from their guilds for pulling bullshit
like this. ;-) Then again, you'll also run into the occasional d00d
guild and only end up with more of a headache... Some guy trained FGs
to Thurg in GD without warning once, started telling me off when I
said something to him, and when I finally went to his guild I was told
that since I wasn't killed by it, I should just mind my own fucking
business...
