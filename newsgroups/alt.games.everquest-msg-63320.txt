The fifth shawl is painful.  Incredibly painful.  You need to gather 75
nodrop, nonstacking threads.

In my case, I had to gather 150, since I failed on the first combine.

For enchanters, the 5th shawl gives you something that the first 4 don't:
CHA.  That made it worth it to me.

Currently working on the 6th shawl.  Got one siren hair, need one more. 
Hopefully I'll succeed on the combine...
