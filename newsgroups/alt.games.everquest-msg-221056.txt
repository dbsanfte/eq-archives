Not real usefull around that level, or later on. Never used it till lvl 55
or so when I chained it with Scintilation in PBAE groups and stopped using
it because it didn't add much value :).

Rains are nice if your group can handle 2 mobs at the same time. it can hit
4 times with 2 or more targets which makes it very usefull.
Also it spreads the damage over time in smaller batches which means less
aggro for you. The extra built-in resist rate of 20% makes it rather crappy
for single targets IMO though.

Yup, hated that too

DS rocks. Let the melee have DS damage on for a comparison, more often then
not it will do more then half the damage of the best dps person in the
group.
That convinced my guild's tanks (years ago) and several even have a hotkey
with "/tell rhand DS please" whenever it starts to fade.

Erm, I still summon lev rings at startup and usually lev anywhere I go. It's
too damn usefull.
Only times I don't lev is when the zone doesn't permit it or when I'm
charming in taki and I need to channel through a 96% hasted freight train
:).

The weapon summons are crap till level 61. Your pet will dual wield with or
without weapons so don't bother.

Hmm focus items were inserted in the game when I was lvl 60 so I never went
through the problem of not having all of them for my level. They're highly
usefull and in groups I always ask if anyone needs any. I myself still use
the bracer and earring because I don't have suitable replacements yet.

Other threads told you it is usefull. When I solo with invested pet
technique I always get a plate set together with some summoned foci and
other pet gear :).

The anti-summoned nukes are all crap. Only one which is worth the mana is
the lvl 64 one so don't bother with this.

Pets get a stuck at times. If you do some dungeon crawls in older dungeons
like seb and chardok you'll know what I mean. Not a typical day-to-day usage
spell, but when you need it you won't know how you ever could have lived
without it :)

I used this spell pretty often after it came out. Moved it to page 50 ever
since I got my silverflank belt (and you'll have to pry that one from my
cold dead hands!).

Don't think so. What level was Monster Summoning 1?

Try the fire at times. the DS will make up for the low hp, if you have the
torch of alna it makes for an even more usefull pet :).
