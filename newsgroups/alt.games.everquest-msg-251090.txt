I'm...shocked, and don't know how to respond.  Sorry.

I think you give DOS too much credit.  It was easier for DOS to remain
backwards compatible since the entire x86 line was backwards compatible.

The C64 ran on a 6510 and the Amiga ran on a 68000.  It would have been
time consuming and expensive for CBM to write a C64 emulator.  DOS never
had to write a CPU emulator to remain backwards compatible.

Which is a direct result of having the most market share.

Sure.  Windows (and DOS before it) are the easy choices.

I agree.

I agree.

Good point.  :)
