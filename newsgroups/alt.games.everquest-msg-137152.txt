Yes, and betcha that if the structure in the middle of the pond had
been a crusifix complete with Christ, no one would have said a peep
about it... Well, maybe the random pagan here and there, but I
garauntee that none of the fundies would have had a problem with it
(despite the fact the city isn't supposed to have religious
landmarks), nor would the majority of any pagans that might be in the
area.

Every religion has it's hypocritical, radical crazies. The fact that
Christianity seems to have a larger number than most (there are
exceptions) is mostly what drove me away from it. I see great value in
a lot of Christian teachings. But I had my problems with other
teachings that would have turned me away even without the crazies -
just without the sour taste in my mouth.

On a side note, wanna see a good example of Christianity's crazies?
