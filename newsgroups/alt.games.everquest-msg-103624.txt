But it did have Bernard Bresslaw and Roy Kinnear in it... kind of 'Carry on 
up the Dungeon'. And a really trippy soundtrack.

as www.rottentomatoes.com puts it:
"Good God, the music! Imagine Yanni opening for KISS with Zamfir playing 
backup pan flute. For those of you who asked us to recommend films to watch 
while chemically enhanced, we can definitely give Hawk the thumbs-up for 
its music alone."

Funnily enough, all the reviews I've seen of it agree it is so cheesy it 
must have been a TV movie. They're all wrong - I actually remember going to 
see Hawk the Slayer at the cinema when it was on general release (I don't 
think it was for long). You kids of today don't know you're born with your 
new-fangled CGI Lord of the Rings and what have you. Why, in my day we were 
glad of a couple of spinning hula hoops and a guy out of shot chucking 
luminous rubber balls around I tell you...

At least Hawk the Slayer was better than Mazes and Monsters...
