I assume you mean a 20g harddrive. XP ain't taking THAT much space. What
else is loaded?

As for your question: every zone he enters has to be loaded. Any that he
has authorized that ain't there when you start, will be re-downloaded by
the patcher.

Buy a 10 or 15 G harddrive and put it in. Move the EQ folder over to it.
Change shortcuts and play. 

A 10g HDD will cost about 20 bucks...
