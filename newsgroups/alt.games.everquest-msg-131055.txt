Paladins and Warriors don't get KEI.  :-p

I send one tell, period.  This is because I don't know of anybody who
isn't annoyed by repeated requests.  And it never disturbs me to be
ignored, people do go AFK, or get involved in four-way conversations
while answering questions in guildchat, or have other good and
sufficient reasons for ignoring a /tell from a stranger (including
being one of those oddballs who consider unsolicited communications in
a massively-multiplayer environment to be some sort of crime).  And
I've long since given up looking for a port by any means other than
guildchat or a tell to a personal friend or a guildmate.  I've run
across multiple zones /shout'ing "50pp for a trans to bind" once or
twice in each with no response except for a tell from a 20 wizard who
offerred to bind me.  At this point I just figure I can get anywhere
on my own in 30 to 45 (less if lucky) using the Luclin bus and SoW
potions, and that's good enough.

Bind Affinity has always been the biggest hassle, not so bad now with
Soulbinders and Nexus (Shadowhaven Soulbinder gives a bearable CR to
pretty much anyplace).  The only time I've ever "needed" a port was
to get between Faydwer/Kunark and Antonica when KOS in Freeport, and
now with Luclin even that "need" is gone.
