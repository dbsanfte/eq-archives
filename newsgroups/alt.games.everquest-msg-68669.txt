That is extremely odd to say the least. is he connecting at at least 28kbps?
if not then that might be the issue. Also if the modem and isp keep trying
to renegotiate a managable speed between them (i.e. Fallback/fall-forward)
then that would be what is "consuming his bandwidth, but honestly if that
happening he isnt getting bandwidth at all. Just my opinion though. I sure i
get flamed for something minor i overlooked.
