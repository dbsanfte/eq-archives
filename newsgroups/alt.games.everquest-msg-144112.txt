Rangers used to suck ass.. totally.  They did a lot of damage, but couldn't
take a blow for shit.. imagine a chanter duel wielding <-- that was a ranger
of old :)

Rangers now...  one of the best damage dealers in the game, some great group
spells, and extremely versatile.  Guildie ranger who i talk with a lot is at
5100 or so raid buffed now, and hes the newest of the old batch of ranger
recruits (the older rangers have more hp).. thats decent, to say the least
