I never ever leave a CHC.

However, I always have my hotkey bank open on a pageful of 'Raid' hotkeys.
Among these, I have a '/healers Interrupted CH to save mana!' hotkey as well
as a '/healers HEALERS, STAGGER CHC AN EXTRA SECOND!' and its counterpart
'/healers HEALERS, PICK UP THE CHC PACE AN EXTRA SECOND!'

They usually do the job.

Also, for boss mobs, I usually have a hotkey to target our designated slower
so I can cast my AA Divine Arbitration after Slow lands. Slowers and or
debuffers usually appreciate it a great deal : )
