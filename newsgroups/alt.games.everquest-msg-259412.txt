Sorry to tack on I lost the original post....
This is the list I have come up with for my cleric:

Jagged Ore of Foresight - Type 3 - 340 Ruj points
Radiant Shard of Thought - *TYPE 8!!!!* - 760 EF points
Brilliant Enchanted Prism - Type 3 *CHEST ONLY* 510 EF points +2 Mana Reg
Bloodied Gravestone - Type 3 - MMC 760 points
Grainy Sandstone - Type 3 - NRO 340 points
Transparent Shard of Thought - TYPE 7! - 760 EF points
Eternal Ice Prism - Type 3 - 1150 EF points +2 Mana regen

(Please note that if you haven't got Type 3 slots on your gear you can't use
those augs... and Type 8 only appear in Planes gear (or so I'm told))

One other augment I recently purchased that is good for casters:

Glowing Sandstone of Focus - Type 3 - 1150 NRO points - has Extended Range IV



Come dance with the west wind...
Healea Sternstar -  65 cleric
Skila Windrunner - 58 ranger
