Sounds to me like your computer is overheating.

Check that you have good airflow around your computer, I can't count the
number of times I have seen people box their boxes in with piles of junk and
papers, blocking airflow to and from the machine.

Turn the machine off.

Open the case and take a can of compressed air to the fans, make sure they
are reasonably clean and turning freely and easily, give the entire inside
of your box a good cleaning this way, making sure not to keep the nozzle too
close to the components or stay in one place too long, as compressed air is
extremely cold.

If you still experience this problem, pick up a utility to monitor your
machine's temperature, any AMD-based motherboard that can run a 600+ CPU
should support monitoring of at least CPU temperature if not multiple other
sources, compare that to the recommended operating temperatures of AMD CPUs,
I know my old 1100MHz seemed to run hot at 47C but apparently anything from
40-ish to 50-ish is considered normal.
