Note "the exception foes not prove the rule" stated above. 

Out of literally hundreds of spells in game, only a few are "nodrop"
and require the player to use expansion zones to get. I took a look at
some of the "nodrop" PoP spells, and none of them are game
makers/breakers. Look past the trees and see the forest. No one is
forced to buy any of the expansions in order to play EQ and acquire
most of the spells/items available in-game.
