Hrmm... interesting question. Never tried it back at those levels. I
suppose it's *possible*, and if you don't mind eating a death or two in
experimentation, I'd say give it a whirl. They've got a ton of hit
points, however, so use your most efficient nukes possible, and of
course, get a KEI before you go. They do snare easily, but until snared
can basically outrun or keep up with jboots, so be wary. You'll want to
snare them first, then root them when you get them to a comfy spot away
from adds. Be aware that you're going to break your best root at 39 on
them pretty often with your DD nukes, so be ready to back up fast and
re-root a lot.

I did 35 to 39 quadding drakkel dire wolves in GD up in the corner near
the EW zone valley. If you refuse to quad, I'm sure they could be root
n' shoot targets too. Again, snare first. Fast little beggars.
