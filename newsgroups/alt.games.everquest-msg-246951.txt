Pardon me while I do something you will never see again...

Thank you for making my day.  I too have issues with Paypal, hence why
this question has arisen...I'm trying to find out if I should go to the
trouble of researching the alternatives.  And I did. And I found one. And
it seems to be even better than Paypal.  www.ikobo.com  Let me know if
you've heard anything fishy about it.

But I truly do believe that www.paypalsucks.com...and I'm so sick of
people who think I'm a whiner because I don't want to use paypal.

Whew, ok, glad I got that out.

Honestly? That is exactly how I"d like it to be.  ACtually, my *ideal*
solution was to have a hardcopy CD be the final product, such that they
would use the USPS's escrow service. They pay upfront, I draw, payment is
released when it arrives.

But then the USPS discontinued that service. /cry

As it is, because many people would not like a complicated structure like
you propose, I've been hesitent to detail it.  I mean...who am I that I'm
so arrogant to think my art deserves an elaborate setup?  Still, my sense
of fairness and honesty compels me towards that sort of solution. An
artist is putting in their time, so they should not have to wait to be
paid until the end, but neither should a buyer pay site unseen for
something.

/boggle Once I start charging $100 (only $25 right now) I intend to make
certain it is done 2 weeks from the time I start it. Mind you, I won't be
able to start right away in some cases. That is why I would prefer folks
not pay me until I can start it.  Some artists say "your picture could
take months because real life takes priority".  Well FFS, if someone is
*paying* me to draw for them, it IS my real life, and I'll treat it as
such!

You see, I've comissioned artists myself and endured 8 months waits. I
hate it. I won't do it to others. I can draw a picture in 2 weeks, so that
is what I intend to guarantee.

> My suggestion: Take credit cards, but go with something other than paypal.

Will do. :)

> Paypal is easy. Paypal is convenient. 

PAYPAL SUCKS!
