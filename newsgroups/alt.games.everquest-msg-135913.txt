Ummmm, no.  No contradiction there.  Note the "if" in the first statemetn
you quoted. "IF" there were a serious condition in the US it would be
disucssed and possibly (note, not definitely, but possibly) planned.  At
this time there is not planning, not even disucssing, the development of
such a character in the U.S.
