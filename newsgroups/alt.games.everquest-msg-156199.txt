All my characters are female also. I don't have any "calling cards"
either, such as flirting too much (or too little) which would sway
anyone to a real life sex opinion either way. I've pretty much never
received even ONE gift. What I find, in fact, is that both my female
wood elf druid or dark elf cleric are asked to HELP others far
more than I ever receive help (from both male OR female characters)
They are both "helping classes."

AAAHAH that is cute. I've never even had anything that obvious.
Well, i did have one weird time with a "furry fetish" probable. It
was when I was first playing a vah shir shamaness and was in qeynos.
As you probably know, they look pretty "healthy" in chain armor. I was
walking around qeynos and some guy starting going,  

"U hav a nice bodey ;)"

Then he said it a few more times and was following me around. I was
about to switch characters anyway, so did in the next zone. I really
did not think much of it though since he was just acting on his furry
fetish and not talking about me in real life. it was kind of funny
because when I was in the next zone he was saying,

"r u coming back? I will wait ;) "

Then I logged.. wonder how long he waited ? aha.

Aahah that is ironic that you roleplay at him, then he tells you that
this is a roleplaying server and that you should get a clue (which is
not roleplaying) I would have said:

" I don't know what this roleplaying is that you speak of, but
I'm not into your pervert dress-up fantasies and will call a 
guard if I have to!"

Nothing is more ironic than a person who thinks they are
a roleplayer telling you that you should roleplay. it renders
them not being one even if they do type something stupid
first like OOC:  What the heck is the point of "roleplaying"
if you continue to mention real life things but put OOC: in front of
them?

AHAH yeah sweetycakes will be a man, 9 times out of 10.
From what I've guessed almost anyone taking advantage of
their perceived "sex" in game, is probably a guy. The real females
I know what to earn what they get on an equal footing. Maybe they
like some attention being paid to them, but not in a sexual way.

I've played with three guys in game who treated my character in
various ways. Two are super cool, they treat me like an equal and
someone who obviously knows a lot about the game. Sometimes we
jokingly /moan or /blush or something but its in fun. The third was
some weird kind of stalker freak. In the third's case we started
grouping when I assumed we were both female because they had
a female character. That was how our friendship started. I think
we kind of did some joking flirting but I find that especially fun
with female characters, since its just joking. Later I find out they
are really male and have something bordering on stalking with some
other female character who I guess is really female. Once that other
char is hardly in game(Probably due to this person), they start acting
like I am the object of their infatuation.

I kind of had no idea what to do in this case. I tried being cool to
them, but then they'd petulantly whine at me and say things like
"HELLO? WHY DOn'T YOU TALK TO ME!" I'd feel sorry for them and
say hi and giving them an inch was like giving them a mile. No matter
how many times I continued to say that I'm only me in this game, that
I don't give out my email, etc they'd continue asking for it. The
weird thing is I acted no different with them than anyone, just
friendly and fun. It escalated to a point where I totally quit talking
to them when I was with one of the two fun guys, for FUN (not stalking
behavior which was spooky) and we were in skyshrine trying to get my
cleric some guardian armor. This stalker type then walks in and I say 

"hello" to them, like I normally due out of courtesy. About
an hour later, after they never said anything, they finally say

"I HOPE YOU ARE HAVING FUN WITH YOUR BASTARD NEW BOYRFRIND >=(  "

I took screenshots of it and was both freaking out AND laughing, it
was just such an off the wall reaction. What a freak.
