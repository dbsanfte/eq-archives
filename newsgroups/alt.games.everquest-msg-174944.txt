I'd rather have seen Orcs as a playable race.

> Enhanced Looking For Group Tool
> New Cartography System

This may be the "selling point," like 51-60 in Kunark, the nexus in Luclin,
and the books in PoP.

> New Magic Item slot: Charms

Well, more to wear means more room for AC, HP, and mana.  Still, it will
probably only show it's usefulness in currently available content.  I'm sure
LoY content will be adjusted for it.

Load times.

Load times.

> Expanded bank capacity

Probably a big deal.

> New zones

I should hope so.  I'd like to see the new zones have more of the old-world
feel.  I think things started getting a bit too strange with SoL with the
aliens.

> New spells

Wizard and druid power will increase exponentially, Shamen and druids will
get CHeal, and Clerics will get group CHeal for 500 mana.  Paladins will
screwed again, of course.
