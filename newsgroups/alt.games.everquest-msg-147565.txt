First, your ping doesn't mean squat.  The other day I was having 2 to 5
second delays in updating my HPs (both numeric and graphic) from self
cast healing spells with a ping of 180 and no noticeable video lag.
Second, if you were sufficiently out of sync with the server (i.e.
lagged) that the server decided you were alongside or in front of the
HG then it could riposte you.  Keep in mind that packets sent across the
internet are not guaranteed to arrive in any particular order (or even
at all), so there can be no guarantee that you will not see game results
reported out of order.
