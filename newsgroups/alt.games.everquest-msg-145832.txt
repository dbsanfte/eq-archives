There is a simple solution to this problem.  Make your local
Rogue your Master Looter.  This way he can practice PP all
he wants and noone suffers.  If he's dishonest and doesn't split
all the loot, well any masterlooter could have done the same.

Oddly, being trusted often causes people to repay your trust
with honesty, while -not- being trusted can tend to make them
willing to betray you.
