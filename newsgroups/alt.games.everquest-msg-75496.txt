Id like to thank all who replied with the help full info...
Well the raid went on last evening... we had only 32 total for the
raid.  I was put in the riffraff group... and boy how I wish I had
better resist gear now...  
only 3 peeps died, and I was not one of them  WHOOT>>>>>
but I had only a sliver of health and one other in my group was at the
same.
Course I got no loot.  Vox dropped the staff and 4 bracers and some
Belt.   No book (2 pallys were there and disappointed)

All in all it was fun but I will not go on another Weeknight raid.
(my eyes were rolling up in my head)

Oh it went like this...
Tanks went in....  got the aggro,  Chanter group went in and sieved
the mana outa the bitch..   in comes the Nukers.... 
She hit the flagstones hard.
