Take the boat to butcher, take the shuttles to FV. Bind.
Then you can merrily go to lake of ill omen which is a pretty good
zone for you. The best way for you to get there is sow, camo, then
facing OUT of FV city run over to the left along shore, continue
running along the zone border where it gets rocky andyou eventually
come to the stream which goes to lake of ill. Or you could go to the
left and then follow the stream up which is faster but if a spider or
something sees you its easy to die. 

Once you zone into lake of ill, you can bind right there and be pretty
safe.
