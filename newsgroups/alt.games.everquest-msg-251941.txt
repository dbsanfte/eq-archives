I know that, and I'm not 'that guy'.

I'm sure if we look we'll find plenty of posts that claim 'eq is a 
stupid action game where you just run around killing yard trash 
endlessly. I see nothing else to do... almost none of the npcs will talk 
to me...and most of the players I see are red to me and won't group. I 
bought a book on tailoring and spent 2 hours looking for a sewing kit 
without success... this game sucks.

In other words...If he got bored in CoH after 2 hours, but he finds 
himself in engrossed in EQ then he's being unreasonable. There is 
nothing in EQ that will grab you in 2 hours of play. Hell.. at higher 
levels... 2 hours of play is barely enough time to get a group and go 
anywhere interesting.
