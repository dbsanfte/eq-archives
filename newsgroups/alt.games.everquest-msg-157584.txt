Well that's good to hear.  I misunderstood your complaint.

Bull.  Druids avoid damage better than anybody.  And tho that talent
is used mostly to solo, I've seen Druids kite enormous trains as a
crowd control measure when nothing else would have served.  That
talent is also quite useful when pulling, something some Druids I
know do very well at.

If that's the only service you have to offer your friends than you
are seriously deficient in imagination.

The provocation is not yours personally, but all the whining fuckwits
who've posted similar bullshit to this ever since Luclin went live,
and every one of them was bitching about the pp, so I naturally
assumed that your post was more of the same shit.  And the fact that
you're not going on about the pp does not make your bitching any less
whiney, nor your analogies any less bogus, it just makes your attitude
slightly less objectionable in my eyes.  Nothing was taken from you.
You suffered no damage.  You have nothing worth bitching about.  Turn
your bullshit back on itself and even you ought to be able to see that
your whine directly implies a desire to deny other players the mobility
granted by PoK, no matter how many disclaimers or assertions of
happiness you may make.  You liked having people dependent on you, which
is emblematic of a control freak, and now you're whining about their
freedom.  Tough shit.
