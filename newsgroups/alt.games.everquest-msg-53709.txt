Who is Mesmer?  Should I care?

Mesmer...sounds like a pretty sad name for a high elf enchanter.  Surname is
probably already planned as "Izer."

Ok, doing a search at google NOW....I'm guessing that the Mesmer in question
is some music group basing it on the Google hits (btw, it's 8th on the hit
list...not exactly THAT popular).   Ok, I answered my first question.  The
answer to my 2nd question is "no." :)
