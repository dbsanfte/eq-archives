Sure.  First, set up a hotkey (on the lower left of your
screen) to be a "Sense Heading" hotkey.  Let's say you
chose hotkey #3 for this.

Now go to your "Options" settings, and choose "Keyboard".
Hit "Next" a few times until you see an entry for "USER DEFINED 3"
(I *think* that's how it's labeled -- or something like that).
Now right-click (not left-click) on the key settings for
that entry.  You'll see a cursor (">") appear on the second
keybinding.  It's waiting for you to hit the key you want to
link to that option.  Now hit, say, the left-arrow button.

What you've just done is left the primary key binding for
"USER DEFINED 3" (i.e., hotkey #3) to be "3" (so that you
can still fire hotkey #3 by hitting your numeric "3" key,
same as always), but you've now defined an "alternate" key
for the same function to be the left-arrow.  Now, every time
you hit the left arrow key, it'll fire your hotkey #3 (Sense
Heading).  Note that the left arrow will still also turn
you to the left, because over on the key binding for "TURN LEFT",
it still has "left-arrow" bound to it as well.  So hitting
the left-arrow key will now *both* turn you to the left as
usual, *and* fire hotkey #3 (Sense Heading).

Warning:  Now turning left will fire hotkey #3 NO MATTER WHAT
HOTKEY BANK YOU'RE ON.  So make sure that hotkey #3 on every
hotkey bank that you use is either also Sense Heading, or
some other "safe" action (or no action at all).

Warning #2:  You've bound your left-arrow key to hotkey #3
FOR ALL CHARACTERS, not just the character you were running
when you defined the new keyboard link.  So again, either
make sure that it's safe to fire hotkey #3 for all characters,
*or* remember to "undefine" the "left-arrow = hotkey#3" link
when you switch to another character.  To undefine the
link, go back to where you defined it, right-click again,
and then hit the "Escape" key.

Tip:  Instead of having hotkey #3 be simply "sense heading",
you can define it as a five-line "social" which fires
sense heading, *and* four other abilities that you want
to practice without having to think much about them 
(e.g. Forage, Sense Traps, etc.)
