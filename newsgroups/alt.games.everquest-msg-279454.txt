Except the OP was referring to the article, not the game. I have nothing 
against people who prefer WoW. I don't think they are ignorant of 
certain important facts that left them to make a poor choice in games or 
anything silly like that. People will like what they like.

However, I still don't understand why people would choose to defend 
their choices in a newsgroup dedicated to the alternate views.

I can respect that, as I would expect you to respect the fact that WoW, 
along with a list of others, was a game for which I took a break from EQ 
to try. When all was said and done, I was back in EQ. Of course it could 
have done much better, but my opinion is that all the others have merely 
done much *less* in trying.

But that's for a different thread. ;)
