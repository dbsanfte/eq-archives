Man, you're wandering around with a pet that's max five levels below
you? That's got to totally suck. Have you been working on Human? How
high can you get the language skill at your level, and how high does it
need to be to make yourself understood by a native speaker?

I'm assuming that the spell isn't for sale in Cabalis, or you'd have
made the trip back there to get it by now. Maybe killing halflings in
Nek and then doing the wine quest so you can buy it there?
