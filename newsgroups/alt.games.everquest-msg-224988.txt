Mana gear and wisdom are important for killing one mob, or cleaning one 
camp.  In the long run, over a 90 minute adventure, they add up to very 
little, a buffer against running OOM in a big pull, but NOT enough mana 
to pull you thru the whole time.

Whats important is how much you use, and how much you get back.

Two things you can have will improve your mana over time: focus effects 
and mana regen.  Do you have Improved Heal III (assuming you use heals 
other than CHeal, for which focus effects are useless) Mana preservation 
III, enhancement efficiency III?  Those will all save you mana on your 
casting, one way or the other.  Save 10% on a spell and you regen enough 
mana to do it again 10% faster.

Similarly, you had KEI, but do you have any FT items or AA?  These add 
up, especially when you spend time on your feet.

> I was pacifying for the ranger to pull, but that doesn't take much mana.

Ah, the spell doesnt, but it means more time on your feet.  Depending on 
how good you and the ranger are at working together to find the lull 
targets, it can mean a -lot- of time on your feet.  No mount indoors, so 
thats costing you about 20 mana per tic... which is more mana than KEI 
gives you!

Warrior is NOT a DPS class, they are good at taking a beating but not so 
good at dishing one out, unless they have great gear compared to 
everyone else in your  group.  Even if their DPS is the same as someone 
else's, their position in front of the mob robs them of 15% of their DPS 
more or less.

If the necromancer was spending his mana feeding you, he wasn't a DPS 
class either; a necro pet probably outdamages that warrior, but thats 
not a hard feat to accomplish.  Necro is a swiss army knife class of 
sorts, capable of reasonably good DPS OR mezzing OR relatively poor 
healing OR feeding mana to someone else... but you have to pick one, and 
you picked one of the less effective ones.  This doesn't seem obvious at 
first, but you have to look at the mana efficiency involved.  I don't 
remember the ratio precisely, but its on the order of two points of 
necro mana spent for every one that you get... probably worse than that. 
  Using necro mana for cleric to heal with is like bringing a second 
cleric along instead, only one who has to spend twice as much mana for 
every spell he casts.  Again, this is good in an emergency, but it sucks 
on a constant basis.  Its very probable you'd have been better off using 
him as a DPS class, killing the mobs faster so you wouldn't have to heal 
so much damage per mob.

Oh, another problem with Twitching; it costs the necro more mana than 
you think: this is because each twitch is relatively small, so he has to 
chain cast it on you. This isn't a problem outdoors on a mount, but 
indoors, thats time on His feet, and that means He is losing 20 mana per 
tic because he isn't sitting down.

The druid seems to have known his position in this group; DS will work 
great on the warrior, and LDoN mobs should die too fast for DOTs to be 
worth worrying about.

I was casting a complete heal *every* mob, sometimes 2.

The armor on your ranger is largely irrelevant, he's not supposed to be 
getting hit; you want to know his haste, his weapons, and his dex 
(because he probably has proc weapons and at any rate has his call of 
line of proc causing spells)

The warrior's weapons don't matter as much because his damage output is 
really not going to mean a whole lot to the fight unless he's 
fantastically twinked out, but his armor and in particular his HP total 
-do-, with Cheal as the main heal, HP matter more than pretty much anything.

As we've observed many times here, another problem with a warrior MT is 
his relatively poor ability to get and hold aggro.  If this means you 
need to stand up for a while after casting a heal or nuke or slow or 
whatever, then that too is time where you are losing 20 mana per tic in 
regen.  And it also may very well mean that either the ranger has to 
hold back and not do as much damage as he is capable of, or that the 
ranger keeps getting aggro, dropping 15 % off his DPS and causing you to 
have to resort to relatively inefficient healing (or the druid to do his 
backup heals job, which takes him off nuke duty which -also- costs you DPS)

What were you landing CHeal at, usually?  That is to say, how low was 
the warrior getting on HP before it hit?  I met someone yesterday who 
healed such that the warrior never got under 50%.  This, she said, meant 
that if a cheal failed for some reason, she had plenty of time to cast 
another.  This logic works fine for normal heals, in  fact a normal heal 
cast at any time where it won't restore the target to 100% HP is just as 
efficient as at any other, there's no reason to let someone get low on 
HP.  But at level 52, you aren't likely to have someone in your group 
with 8000 hp, so all cheals heal past 100%... the more wounded the 
victim when it lands the more HP you get out of it.  Her strategy would 
have been mana efficient only if the tank had 16000+ hp!

You don't discuss the chanter at all.  What was he doing, putting you on 
autofollow and having a beer down at the pub with his buddies?  He could 
have been A) Lulling instead of you (see above as to why this cost you 
lots more mana than you thought) B) Mezzing mass pulls instead of using 
lull C) acting like another medium DPS producer via animation + Nukes, 
or D) acting as the highest DPS member of your group by grabbing a 
charmed pet [not for the faint of heart, but devastatingly effective if 
you are good at it] and managing him

Your group had one high DPS (the ranger) one medium DPS (the druid) and 
two low DPS (warrior, necro pet) classes, its hardly surprising you were 
killing things slowly.  Turn the necro into a second High DPS class, add 
either a medium DPS or high DPS enchanter,  tune for the lower mana 
supply on the cleric and you'd do half again as fast... which would turn 
"we barely made it in 90 minutes" to "we breezed thru it in 60 minutes"
