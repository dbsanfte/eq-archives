Up to level 60, the cap on all stats is 255.  After level 60, the cap 
goes up by 5 points for each level.  In addition, after level 60 you can 
purchase AA abilites that further raise the cap.  Maximum cap with AAs at 
level 65 is 355 for INT and WIS.

Protection of the Cabbage, Protection of the Grove, Protection of the 
Nine, or Blessing of the Nine, all druid spells.

Get the flowing thought items, even at the expense of Wisdom.  Over 200, 
the amount of mana Wisdom adds is small, far more important in general is 
your mana throughput, not manapool.

Varies quite a bit by server, but, first, and likely cheapest, is the 
Solstice Earring, you can usually find kits for the quest for sale for 5k 
or more.  It is a mana regen 1 earring, with decent stats.  Beyond that, 
there are several LDoN augments that you can get using points.  You can 
also go to the bazaar, and do a search on mana regen items to see what is 
available on your server.
