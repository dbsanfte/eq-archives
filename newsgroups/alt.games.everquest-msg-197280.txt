Yes, this is true.  But since the other trials are generally more difficult
than the "easiest" trial, and it already takes a massive effort to get that
one unflagged person past the "easiest" trial, doesnt it occur to you that
deciding "hey, that 12 foot wall I'm trying to help you climb over is busy,
lets see if we can boost you over the 15 foot wall instead" is an even bigger
waste of time?

Now again, an uber guild with tons of really great gear and really massively
AA'd people in it can casually enough take on the other trials to do flagging
for alts or lagging members... but a more typical guild with some 65s and
some 50somethings isn't really likely to pull that off.  And since noone in
those Uber guilds is complaining about the situation, solving this problem
for them isn't really of interest.

No, if the trials were hard but not excruciatingly hard, they wouldn't be a
bad idea.  Increase time per mob to 45 seconds.  Max of two Rocks per
spawn... or even a predicatble mix.  Lower mob HP a bit.  To balance all
this, keep flagged people from participating in trials at all, just as 53+
people can't do Vox or Naggy.  Now you get a trial that -can- be done by a
group of 62- people, and at the same time, trials mean 6 new flags every
time, instead of one or two.  And even if it takes you a dozen tries, once
you get past them, you are done forever.  Got uber 65's available to help?
Let em come buff up, like we do now for Vox/Naggy kills.  But they shouldn't
be a baseline requirement, just helpful.

But thats my opinion on the matter, apparantly SOE is so disgusted by the
trials they are killing the idea entirely, along with quite a few other
flagging necessities.

If they don't like those flags (and they are radically different from each
other) then why they are keeping -any- flags in the game is open to question,
AFAICS
