Monk.

My monk has soloed to 35 so far, and is still doing fine.

Bite off more than you can chew?  Feign Death.  It's the "Get out of trouble
free" card.

To heal, just bind wound to 50%, then mend.  That gets you to 75% health,
almost 4 full bubs of HP, and you're ready to go again.  You spend a lot on
bandages, but if you hunt in places where even moderate loot drops, you'll
still make money.

To reduce downtime, you can duo with a healer.
