Level :-)

Plane of Valor and Plane of Storms are Tier 2 -
to get there you either complete a PoJ trial (at 52 you'd
have 5 people completing it and dragging you through)
or level to 55.

Tier 3 is HoH, BoT, CoD, Tactics and...... Torment?

To get there you either get a raid flag or a quested flag,
or get to 62 for HoH, BoT and CoD.

HoH - quest flag (can't remember it all, but pieces of it
drop in PoV) or kill Aerin Dar, the crystalline dragon in PoV
He's a wuss as far as HP/Resists go - but he has a mammoth
fear+500hp per tick ae DoT and adds that wake up and come
to his assistance as he goes down.  We just killed him last
night after failing last week :)  Mage kill shot - then this
mage aggro kited the adds while other mage pet and the 2
rangers killed them (it wasn't intentional - they were rampaging,
things were going south and I got low health aggro and took
off in large circles :)

BoT - the quest flag requires you to kill giants - you need
a storm giant head (1) drop of any of the 3 kinds, you need
a piece from each of the 3 kinds (beard, sash, bone) and 2
esoteric medallions (from different camps) that only drop off
of names.  We've 2 grouped the names before - they can be
a bit nasty.

CoD - there's a quest flag, or you kill Grummus in Plane of
Disease.  We took him clean on our first try with 40 people.

Tactics - Quest flag - get the four medallion pieces from
Diaku in PoS desert and turn in for a group flag.  Single
groupable.  Or, kill Manaetic Behemoth in PoI factory 
(which requires you kill Xanamech to get the flag).  We
succeeded at that in concert with another guild.  Problem
with MB is the spider adds - if they make it into his 
room they detonate in a 4k ae explosion - NASTY.

Torment I simply don't know - Kill Terris Thule?  If
that's the case, then you need to complete the PoN hedge
maze trial (18 person max escort type trial) just to
flag to get to PoNB and take TT on.


However - keep in mind that I made 62.5 to 63.5 in one
long session in a BoT lower sands group.  I've also made
1 AA per hour in PoV Back Cave - although there was no
one at Front Cave and we were pulling from there.  We
tend to be spawn limited in tradition PoV / BoT camps
rather than DPS limited.
