Personally, I find focus effects worth way more than either.  At L30
my Druid has a WIS of only 135 with around 100 in +mana items.  But
with my assortment of focus items, esp. Affliction Efficiency II and
Extended Affliction II, mana is never an issue.  With these my most
heavily used spells (DoTs, Snares, Roots, Fear) cost less to cast
and last longer.  I'd have to have a lot more WIS and Flowing Thought
2 (or better?) to match what I'm able to do now if I didn't have the
focus effects.
