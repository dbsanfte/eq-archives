Don't need the book, just combine the metal bar (silver for starting)
and a gem in the jewelry kit. Start with the cheapest that's not
trivial to you yet and work up in order of expense to about jade (I
think), then switch to electrum-malachite. The trivial's a lot higher
than jade, but the next gem up to combine with silver is really
expensive. In the end, it's cheaper to jump on the trivials to next
metal/lowest gem (malachite).

Now, the jewelry will just be sparkly pretties unless the metal is
enchanted. That's why jewelcrafting is generally seen as a tradeskill
mainly for enchanters.
