In that case, you'd want an FD puller or someone who can mezz the mobs 
there.  It's been a very long time since I've done anything other than 
Xanamech in PoI.  Only hope you seem to have is that the bard can mez the 
mobs there, I don't know off hand what the mob level limits are on a 60 
bard mezzing.
