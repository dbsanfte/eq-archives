>It could possibly have something to do with the level of players in

This is something that always amazes me, and I think BIZBEE has hit
the nail on the head....

I would assume that the morons you meet at levels 20-30 in zones like
LoIO eventually wind up in DL and the other 30+ zones.

One theory I have is that most people are more interested in getting
levels (1-30) than in minding their manners. True newbies are usually
decent players through all the levels, but most veterans don't want to
waste time bat/rat bashing, when they are leveling up and alt or
twink. Since almost every class doesn't get "really" good until 30+
the mad rush to level leaves manners in the dust.

When things slow down 30+ most morons straighten up more or less, due
to the inter-dependancy of the classes. In other words the dickhead
warrior who trained and KS'd your celric in LoIO at level 20 will be
the nicest guy in the world when your both in your 40s and the need
for res, complete heals, and full groups is most important.

There will always be morons that never reform. They either join guilds
of people as moronic as themselves, or fade away.
