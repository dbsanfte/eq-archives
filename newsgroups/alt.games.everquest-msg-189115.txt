I had an odd experience with a guard the other day.

I was happy minding my own business on my way through WC when I got jumped
by a Griffin, lucky since I had been killing Humans I had a buffed pet up so
the Griffin didnt last to long, But as it got low on health and started
flying away it aggro'ed a guard and the guard started beating on it.

I figured the guard would take the kill like they do, so I sat down and
waited for my pet and guard to finsh it off, but when the griffin died I got
no exp yet a body was left behind I was able to loot seemed rather odd.

And not all guards are bad however, I love the wolf guards in the Great
Divide and often do what I like to call Guard kiting.

1) Sow self

2) Pull Giant with slow or DoT

3) Run close to wurm cave with Giant in hot pursuit gathering around 2 or 3
wolfs on the way

4) Run around in circles until guards get aggro

5) Laugh manically as Giant kills the guards one by one all the while
getting lower and lower on health

6) Run in and finsh off the Giant getting all the exp, faction and loot for
half the effort.
