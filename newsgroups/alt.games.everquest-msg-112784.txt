I've been using the Radeon 8500 for some time now, and it seem to work
fine (now that the flickering texture problem has been fixed).  I'm
using the most recent approved drivers from the ATI site
(4.13.01.9021) and I really haven't tweaked anything else.  This is
with Windows 98SE, P4 1.6 Ghz processor, and 512 Mb SDRAM.

Now, in areas with a LOT of new models (specially shadowhaven) I do
run into some framerate stutter, but not a whole lot.  I was running
into that before with my Voodoo 4 and old textures upon occasion, so
it's not really a surprise.

So, I'm pretty much using the driver and card settings at default
levels, and nothing fancy with the game settings either.  To be fair,
the Radeon was having a lot of trouble for a while with Luclin.  Boats
would have their textures painted over half the visible world
(terrible lookint) and any moving textures (on characters, for
instance) would flicker and disappear randomly.  Recent patches to EQ
and updates the the Radeon drivers have fixed these problems.
