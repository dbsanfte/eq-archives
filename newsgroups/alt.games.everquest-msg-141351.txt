At which point the newbie wasted the food.

You can't 'force feed' a stat-food and get any benefit.

not true... they've actually said the OPPOSITE by warning that
'force-feeding' is a waste of food.

EQ checks if you're hungry, then deducts 1 item of food from the first stack
it can find... the size of the food (snack, meal, feast, banquet,etc...)
determines how long before it checks again. If it can't find any food, it
warns you, even though you're not actually hungry yet.

Force feeding adds HALF of the value of the size of the food to that
counter, upto the 'you can't eat anymore' limit, before checking again.

My guess is that they somehow found a way for that 'hunger/thirst' search to
combine with the 'equipped items' code in a way that lets you have another
'equipment slot' but only if it's a recognised food/drink item. (because
that's the ONLY item-type that shows up on the hunger search).

That's why it doesn't matter what you last ate, because there's no actual
code checking to remember what that was, but there was already code to check
if there is a valid food item available for later.

not a bug... more like a programming 'kludge' that gets around having to
totaly re-write big chunks of code :o)

If it's a bug, then it can't be a 'nerf' it has to be a 'fix' and the fact
that you could benefit from it was 'an exploit' :o)
