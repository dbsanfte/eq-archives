I got my corpse mule in the Hole one last week...this was on E. Marr.
My corpse mule is just level 7, but is a good place to store rogue
extras (which I happen to have a LOT of) that I might could use or
sell some day.  I got her the Whistler just because I happened to
pick up another gem and still had the salts left over from the last
poison fest, so dropped 500 pp on her (with good CHR this is
still incredibly easy to do) and got her a new weapon before
attacking the quest guy to get back to Paineel.
