I'd have sent you mine, only for some reason despite never removing
them and knowing it worked not that long ago, it doesnt work any more
:(

They removed it because people got snobby about the exact numbers, and
I think they also feared opposition would try and make use of those
numbers.

Its supposed to indicate that if you are a newbie, they think you
might want to start here - however, if you have friends on any of the
servers it shouldnt stop you going wherever you feel

(I play on test for example)

There are a number of words/names which are in a dictionary or already
used, these will be picked up almost immediately, if there are no
guides on I think the name checking takes around 3 or 4 seconds, if
there is a guide on they get a box to approve your name, and can be
quite mean about the interpretations of the naming rules, and just
keep hitting decline.. but, chances are most of the reason you cant
find a name is because someone already has a toon of that name.

They revamped the UI a lot about err 15 months back, believe me it
took most of us a while to get used to it, but it is better its just
hard that there is no real update on online info to help you learn.

There should be a window bar (unless like me you remove it) which
allows you display various windows and you've obviously found the
thing about mapping keys to suit you.  Find a quiet spot somewhere,
and get used to the windows and keys and things.. and type /help for
commands, there are a good few in there, you may wanna make use of

I use cursor keys and use either alt or control dunno, I just do it
which is a side step, I think by default its alt... so you can do in
my case alt + right and it will just side step you to the right.
