Back in the days when ports from Wizards and Druids were the only good way
to travel quickly, my recollection as a Wizard was that people who were
asking for ports were far more likely to ask Druids than Wizards.  This was
probably for several reasons:

1. Druids got their West Commons port earlier.  On servers where the EC
tunnel was the main auction zone, this made Wizards useless for many porters
until level 39 (or 34 for those willing to accept a port into Nektulos).

2. Wizards didn't have a port into the Qeynos area.  Closest we had was
West Karana (uselessly to the East side of WK, just a short run to the
NK port).  So anyone going to that side of the world wouldn't think of
asking a Wizard.

3. Druids have SOW and Wolf form.  They can help you with your post-port
travel (and Druids often throw in SOW for free).  I suppose SOW is also a
factor pre-port, in that a Druid is able to get to where you are meeting for
the port faster.

4. In places where both Wizards and Druids had ports, the Druid location was
often better than the Wizard location.  The most famous example is Skyfire.
The Wizard port is far from the zone, in a place that often is full of
hostile mobs.  It was not unusually to see 4 or 5 mobs at the port, and
another 3 or 4 about to path through it.  And some of these mobs liked to
dispell SOW.
