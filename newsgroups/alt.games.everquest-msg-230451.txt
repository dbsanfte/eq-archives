An interesting point though, is that none of the plat in the game comes 
from selling items to players.  Every last bit of cash comes in to play 
from being looted off mobs, or from items sold to vendors.

All the items sold to vendors should also come from the bodies of mobs, 
but there have been some exceptions where people could buy items, use 
them in trade skills, then sell the results back at a net profit.  This 
apparantly wasn't intended and every effort is being made to make this 
impossible in the future.

There have also been a few cheats where people have been able to 
"duplicate" platinum, turning say 1000pp into 2000pp into 4000pp and soo 
on.  Those are more clearly cheats, whereas the trade skill activities 
seem honest by comparison.

Then there have been bizare things like sharks dropping 1000000 pp at a 
time and so forth, introducing outrageous amounts of cash into the game.

But by far, most of the cash comes directly off mobs or from selling the 
"vendorables" off mobs; ordinary weapons, gems and the like.

A player might make his money by selling bone chips or spider silks to 
other players (getting 100 times as much from them as from vendors) or 
selling Ornate molds (worth tens of thosands of pp to players), or 
palying KEI vendor (making thousands of pp an hour for casting spells 
that don't cost any pp to cast)... but all that is just shuffling the 
cash around, not actually creating it.  The cash those people pay 
ultimately comes from mobs or from items dropped by mobs... if they 
didnt' loot it, the person who gave it to them, or the person who gave 
it to that person, or so on, did.

Oh, and along these same lines, plat only leaves the game when you buy 
things from vendors or use it for quests (or quit a character and don't 
do anything about the money, or even more rarely deliberately delete 
money).  This is funny, because due to the "vendor ripoff" phenomenum, 
there's little of value to buy that you can't find much better for much 
less money buying off players.  A caster might spend 600pp on buying 
spells from vendors over his life, the average player may spend another 
1000pp buying food and water off vendors over his life... but the 
average player probably makes over 50,000pp over his life.  Is it a 
surprise that there's a lot of money floating around after a few years 
of this sort of economy?

Splendid
