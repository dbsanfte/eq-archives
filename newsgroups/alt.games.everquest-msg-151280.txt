/hijack on

    I do sorta like The Sims, though not nearly as much as EQ.  Sims
Online is not out yet, but is due before '03.  Thinking about getting
it, but I'm not sure I want to cut into my EQ time like that.  I can see
it becoming basically a large chat rooms with avatars that spend their
time watching tv, going to the bathroom, and ordering pizza when
appropriate.  Not sure that would be all that much fun.  But.... how
really knows, until it comes out.

/hijack off

   As for buy pre-made characters... /shrug  I don't doubt that soon or
later SOL will give it a shot.  Seems like less of a risk for them than
the Stormhammer server was, at least in terms of initial financial
outlay.  But yeah, I'm not really sure I want to group with a level 30
enchanter who has never heard *Ding* with that character, and who used
to play a level 55 warrior.  Might be useful if one could tell that a
character is prebought by having a dollar sign behind their name, or
something like that.

Annie <--- Would keep playing anyways, unless Sims Online turns out to
be REALLy kick ass
