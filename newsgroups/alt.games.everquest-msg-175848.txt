This question brings to mind a post I made a while ago.The fact that
warriors have little to no "carrot at the end of the stick" aspect that most
classes do.Magic types have new spells every 5 levels but warriors have
bash,dual wield then double attack then repose after 25 levs there is
nothing.Many will say its all in the armor and weapons but I also hear
warriors get the shit end of the stick as far as loot.But my warrior is only
18th so I only here this from here.
