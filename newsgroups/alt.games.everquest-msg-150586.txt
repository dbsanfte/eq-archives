EVERYTHING used to spawn on server up...  uber_guild15 bitched and bitched
that "the god damn japs and nazi guilds kill everything after a patch while
Americans are working and time lock the mobs.  This is an American game!
This is an outrage!"

(thats what one of their members actually posted on a message board.. tho it
was more along the lines of, "those fuckin germans time lock mobs and we
never see them.. damn nazis have time locked every TiV since he came into
the game)

Included in that is a slight randomness... e.g VS spawns every 3 days, in a
6 hour period around the time he was last killed (ie can pop upto 3 hours
early, and 3 hours late)

Anyway VI decided to include random spawn timers... mobs have specific spawn
timers already (e.g Tormax 1 week, Statue 5 days, Vindi 8ish hours, Aary 1
week, flurry drakes.. a day?)

So mobs no longer pop on server up (they even changed stuff like Yael, and
more recently the Gylphed cycle)...

It pops within a 24 or so hour random period.. and then the mobs regular
repop timescale takes over (which includes a randomness its self)

> The Shissar mob for the Chanter epic spawn in fear?

Pretty sure shissar will pop within the first 2 days of server up, but when
CT pops he will repop the zone.. and this can /poof the shissar.

> Broken Golem?

Will be up today

> The minis in Fear and Hate?

Will be up today at some point.. CT popping will make sure they are up
anyway.

If we plan to kill CT, with patch day on Thursday, we would schedule the
raid for Friday.. chances are he wont show his ugly head till late.

Actually for *any* plains, we leave it a day for the zone to fully pop and
boss to pop.. dont expect to see tunare up anytime soon on patch day.

Planes are weird in that they dont automatically pop any mobs on server
up(and never have).  If you camped in a plane before a patch, when you
logged back in (right after the servers came up) the  plane would be empty
of mobs.
From past experiences this is a manual gm thing.

I forget for these, not something we hunt.. werent they 2 days after server
up, then 1 week after the last death.

Most guilds have officers that have twinks in various zones, and either
using track, eye of zom, guildinvite, or showeq, can easily tell if most
mobs are up within a matter of minutes.

There are predicted times of certain mobs.. you know whos gonna be up before
who generally.  Im not sure you will find this posted anywhere... its
something most guilds keep to them selves prettymuch.. sortof their "raid
targets" guide for patch day.

If you dont expect a mob and are too slow, chances are you can miss a lot on
patch day... and its a day when most guilds are on in force because all game
mobs will be popping.

Even on Prexus (4 "uber" guilds, probably 10 tier 3 guilds) where your
basically racing against everybody, you can have a good streak.  I remember
1 patch day we killed (in 1 day), not in order
Zlandi
Klandi
Doze
Tormax
Vindi
Statue
Yeli
Rumble
Doomshade / other umbral named
TiV / other akheva named
Then moved into nToV and spent the night in there.

Zland/Kland/Tormy/Yeli are probably the most contested mobs on Prexus.. when
you killed one you knew without doubt you'd beaten a guild who was planning
the mob a little after you did.. to kill them all..  we had a fun day :)

If you want specific mob predictions..  drop me an email.  Not guaranteed..
but mob pops are something we check every single patch day, so we have a
somewhat better guess of pops than the average player
