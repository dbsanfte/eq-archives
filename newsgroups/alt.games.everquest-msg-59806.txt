The biggest objection to DKPs has always been in the minor details
that pop up after everyone agrees "it's a great idea".

Example:  What constitutes a raid?  What if you're late?  What if you
leave early?  Who determines the amount of point and the cost of an
item?  Given that casters are generally less gear dependent than
meleers, how do you reconcile that aspect?

Basically, by the time you get the DPK system patched to a degree
that's workable, you come down to a simple judgement call.  If you
can't trust the leads to make the calls fairly and impartially, it's
time to find a new lead.

We do the same.
But rather than keeping track of points, we assign "captains" of each
class, balanced with co-capts who are there to assist and help manage
the class.

Captains are assigned mostly based on their ability to keep things
fair.  They can track attendance and base "rank" and amount of
contribution however they want.  But they need to be able to answer
for their determination.  Again, if you can't trust the lead to assign
captains who are impartial, time for a new lead.

In a word, our guild is a benign dictatorship.  Lead's word is final,
end of discussion.  Sometimes bad calls happen, but generally those
are break downs in communication more than anything else.
