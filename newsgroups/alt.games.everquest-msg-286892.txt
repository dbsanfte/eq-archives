I'll reserve judgment until I see the new window, but the old /claim
command could definitely use a better UI (especially if they added a
"tip" window when you open the Claim window).  Heck, if nothing else,
maybe this means my bazaar mules won't have to sit through a dozen
lines of /claim offers every time they log in, caused by having bought
the Anniversary Edition:

I hope they'll replace all that with a single message, such as, "Your
account has a reward(s) waiting to be claimed.  Type /claim to examine
and select them.  Please remember that each reward can only be claimed
by a single character on a single server on this account."

Only just looking at DoDH myself, but I'm pretty sure there are some
melee discs available from those missions.  Maybe when discs got
changed to let you right-click them instead of having to give them
to a guildmaster, these got missed?

And it's aesthetically displeasing having the pet superimposed with you,
and that's something that you get to see every time you summon one.

Hm, I wonder if it opens up any exploits involving sticking your nose in
a wall and summoning a pet to get it on the other side?  (Can you cast
Bind Sight on a pet?)

This does sound like it's designed to stop the trick of getting
Earthshaker to proc on ripostes.  Presumably there are other weapons
where the proc on riposte was a bonus.  Heck, even the little vendor
bought "melee augments" that proc a modest DD or DOT were a nice bonus
on ripostes.  Maybe that was determined to be unbalancing?
