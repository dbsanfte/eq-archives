Heroism is level 52, same as Heroic Bond. If the >0.75 factor is right,
Heroism should stick to a 40 but not a 39. Still not sure if that's the
right formula, haven't had time to experiment yet.

Yes indeed. Especially so for raids where large level spreads are common.
If they would make the target level limit equal to the exp grouping range 
with respect to the spell level (level * 0.67 rounded down), that would 
make so much more sense.
