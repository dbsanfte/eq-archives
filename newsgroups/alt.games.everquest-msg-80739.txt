Hi all, I started playing on this server for the first time and I've learned
that it is tuff. really tuff.
I get jumped and attacked when I'm weak, and all that other good stuff. But
I still think PVP can be alot of fun.

I'm looking to form a team from 5-10 players who like to play. I'm not
looking to have some huge guild or anything like that. Just players to grow
together and watch each others back. We will share all knowledge with each
other, and help each other out on quests and all that good stuff. There are
some conditions for the team below.

1. We all will be starting with new characters.
2. When more than one of us is online, we only group
with our own team memberes only.
3. Learn to play with each other together so our
strength comes from playing together from our
skill instead of our numbers.

Thats it! If your interested email me the type of character you want to
play, and we will set up a time we can talk together. I'm looking to be
organized to go within 1 to 2 weeks.

Once again I'm not looking to form some huge guild or anything like that,
our power will come from growing together and learning how one another plays
together.

If this sounds like something you want to do email me
