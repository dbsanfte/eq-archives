When people act like children it is sometimes best to treat them like
children.  If Verant's version is true, those people KNEW they were doing
something wrong...but did it anyway.

How do you treat a child that knows not to do something, but goes ahead &
does it anyway?   You don't make it so they can't do that thing again (well,
you might, but not as a first reaction).  You PUNISH them (assuming we're
still allowed to punish children).

It's not a hard concept.  Don't do something you KNOW is wrong.  If you're
level 50+ you KNOW what's wrong.
