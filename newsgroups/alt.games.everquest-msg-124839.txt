I just stated what looks to be faily simple quest, Initiate Symbol of
Tunare.  NPC Yeolarn first sent me out for 4 bone chips. Upon
returning, I gave him the bone chips, stacked.  I did not get the
expected response.  Because I have a printout of the Quest, and knew
the right words to say, it looks like everything will continue on
normally without some of the expected verbage. Were it not for the
printed quest guide, I'd still be there trying to figure out what to
do next.   Is it because I gave the bone chips stacked ?  Do you
normally give items to an NPC one item per container or is stacked OK?
