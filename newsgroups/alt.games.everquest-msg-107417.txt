You could have made a new troll and drug the corpse yourself. Here's how. be
on with your Druid, type /consent fxtyrepryewsxzp (you can consent names
that aren't currently online and that aren't currently in existance. Now
camp and make a new character, make him a troll and name him fxtyrepryewsxzp
(or whatever) and go drag the corpse.
