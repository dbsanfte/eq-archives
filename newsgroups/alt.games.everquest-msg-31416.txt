Wizards at low and mid levels seem to have a hard time getting a group.
On raids, they are in high demand. They can solo *very* well at high
levels.

Great for soloing, all I hear is whining from the high level crowd about
being nothing but mana-batteries on raids. Erudites have better starting
int than DE.

They are extremely group friendly: they have heals, Skin line, regen,
wolf form, SOW, nukes, dots, ports... all very desired in a group. Maybe
not as group friendly in the end game though.

This is way off. I would agree they are "vulnerable" as soloists, but in
the hands of a *patient and smart* player they can solo well. Group
desirability should be 5 out of 5 even at low and mid levels. They do
not have the best debuffs, shaman slow line is better in the long run.
Lot's of people choose HE for race, but in actuallity, erudites can end
up with better starting stats, and with infravision at level 4, they
probably make a better choice.

I'd probably put mage at 4 of 5 for both.

Way off. Solo 4 of 5? Don't think so; try maybe 2 of 5. Group, maybe 3
or 4 of 5. Fizzle rate is only a factor when you first get spells. Lay
on Hands is not a Complete Heal. Paladin epics are not the most powerful
weapons in Norrath. Paladins are good tanks, just after warriors and
close to, if not tied with, Shadowknights.

Solo 2 or 3 of 5. Group, 1 or 2 of 5. Not a tank due to no plate armor
(they can wear metallic, just not "plate" - see silver plated legs,
truesilver armor, etc). They are a damage dealing melee class. Don't
think I have ever seen a human ranger - all are wood elves or half
elves.

Well, they can solo better than any other melee class, except maybe a
monk (esp Iksar monks), but I wouldn't give em more than 3 of 5 for
solo. Group, they make excellent tanks, tanking ability just under
warriors. Can taunt really well. Damage output is low for melee class.
They get great utility/self sufficiency spells: they can lifetap, invis,
invis to undead, locate and summon corpses, get pets, can buff
themselves a little, and can Feign Death (second best pullers in game
after monks). Not sure why you'd say humans make the ideal SK - I'd go
either Ogre/Troll if you want to max your tanking, or DE/erudite if you
want to max spellcasting.

Can solo well (just slow and boring).

Solo is 1 of 5. They don't deal the most damage up to 15, but thats
largely irrelevant since pre 15 is hardly worth basing a choice on.
Warriors are all about HP/AC - tanking and taunting. No other class (for
better or worse) tanks like a high level warrior.

Rogues are not tanks. They are melee damage dealers (and excellent ones
at that). Solo is 1 of 5, group is 5 of 5. Can hide and sneak, making
them the only class that can be both invis and invis to undead at the
same time. Strength being the most important stat for rogues, I'd
probably rate dwarves and barbs as ideal rogues over halflings.

Not sure what you mean by "more powerful than the hybrids". I'd probably
put them at 4 of 5 for grouping, they make great melee damage dealers,
on par with rogues. Can solo well up to 50 (not sure after that). Best
pullers in game due to quicker refreshing FD than SKs.
