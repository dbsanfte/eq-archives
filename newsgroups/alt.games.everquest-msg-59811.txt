When you get cut off, you first have the PL line which goes all the way to
100% packet loss. When 100 is hit you are "disconnected". The same thing
happens on the server so your char is still active for that period. Then
when the LD settles in your char will be in the game world for an additional
30 seconds, but taken over by the server (and has [LD] behind the name).
This means that if you were fighting it will continue fighting for 30
seconds, if you were running you will be running for an additional 30
seconds etc.
The AI also will have you go melee fighting if you get attacked by anything
while you weren't fighting before. Not sure if any spells are fired, but my
guess is not.

All this means that you can come back to some odd situations. A bard running
with Selo's on will probably find himself on the other side of the zone, a
caster who happend to go LD near a mob is bound to come back to his bind
point stripped of all his equipment (ie. he died).

Hope this answers any questions :)
