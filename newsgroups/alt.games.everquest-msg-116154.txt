Doesn't really matter to anyone....except for those who play on PvP servers.

Being inspected by someone was a tip-off that you might be being sized up
for an attack.  Rarely happened in my experience, since well thought out
attacks rely on surprise, and inspecting before attacking would kind of tip
the potential target off......

However now (or very soon), an opponent can stealthily scope you out head to
toe and know what to expect of you.....

Of course, if you're a class that doesn't have to rely on equipment too
much, this can be used to your advantage, as deception based on equipment
has worked to my advantage before...
...... just maybe my PvP Wizard will hang onto his newbie tunic a few dozen
levels longer...muahahahahha....
