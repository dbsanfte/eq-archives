Hehe, yep. If it didnt proc before level 20 its almost better to throw a Giant Grub Digger
at your char (hehe, saw a guy trying to sell one in GFay for 170pp).
But the proc make it a great twink weapon, but 99% of the sellers dont know it proc at that
level, so noone buys it. Helps a lot on selling it if you type proc at level 1 into the
auction line
