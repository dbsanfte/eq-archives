[What resist gear to get?]

Do try to get the camp. And, on the way down, get the Runed Bone Fork
(sp?) in Uguk, for your range slot. I can't remember stats on the RBF,
but it is a good resist item. The king camp requires a high-level guy
to single-pull or a competent crowd controller, though. One more stat
on that crown: 12ac, so you won't lose much ac by equipping it either.

FWIW, I've held that camp with a 52 cleric, 51 enchanter and 51 or 50
(I forget) warrior. We had to zone on our first try (There's a portal
to the Uguk/Inno zoneline right behind the throne), but on the second
try everything went like a charm, and we had time left to pull nearby
camps for more exp while waiting for respawns.
