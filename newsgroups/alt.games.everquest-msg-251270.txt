Well you have to look at it from cost/benefit standpoint.

Its only really useful for a couple levels, and as a wizard, on most 
targets you are better off casting nukes.

For a cleric, the same pet is good for about 6 levels, and its a mana 
efficient way to do damage on any half decently long lived mob, compared 
to other cleric means of doing damage.
