The Bazaar, as implemented, has always been a bad idea.  It continued
to degrade the importance of cities, it unduly benefitted those with
always-on Internet connections, it encouraged way too many people to
stuff themselves in the same zone at the same time leading to performance
issues.

I think a better approach would have been a mini-Bazaar in every city,
which are not linked to other bazaars, and to allow offline trading.
