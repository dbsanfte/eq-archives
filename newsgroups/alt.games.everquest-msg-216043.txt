Yea, and they are pretty resisty to DoTs and nukes too, at least the
mediocre ones that this 50s beastlord can generate. But pacify is your best
friend in LDoN, clerics and pallies seem to be batting just about 1.000 with
it. If anything this seems to make paladins into the ideal LDoN tank in my
experience thus far, being able to pacify each room as we go hence saving
the cleric's mana.
