If you are not using missile weapons, are not a backstabbing rogue, and are
not trying to get a weapon to proc, you don't need more DEX.  If you aren't
trying to learn defensive skills faster, AGI is only important for its
contribution to AC.  Dumping +AC for +AGI will not raise net AC, so is
pointless.

Compare to others of your class and level, and see if they are doing more
damage than you.  The rate that mob difficulty goes up does not match the
rate that player skill goes up.  There are some level ranges where most
classes simply find that they aren't doing as well against mobs as they used
to.  You could simply be in one of those ranges at the moment.
