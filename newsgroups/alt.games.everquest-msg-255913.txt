AND focus gear can extend them.

So if you have 40% extend AA and 15% extend focus, does that mean 55% 
extended, or does it mean extend by 40% and then extend that new total 
time by 15% (for a total of 61% extension)?

Regardless  of which is correct, which of the two methods, both 
logically possible, did the guy doing the advertising use to calculate 
his extension?

If he casts it on himself, he gets the real answer without having to do 
any math or any guessing, and I can check his answer when he casts it on me.

As an ex mage, I can tell you that lots and lots of KEI casters do not 
have any extended buff focus item at all, which means I got a lot of 
free KEI in exchange for a summoned focus item.  This didn't work out as 
well for Virtue casters, as the higher level clerics were much more 
likely to already have a buff extender, oddly enough, even though they 
needed IV level while the KEI people only needed III level.

This means that they are only vaguely familiar with what happens when 
they put the buff item on, so I imagine they are probably just guessing.
