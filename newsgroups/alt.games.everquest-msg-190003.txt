LANkrypt0 vandalized the alt.games.everquest bathroom wall with:

L> I remember a year or so ago someone posted a picture on everlore that
L> showed a secret island, no mobs on it, I believe an NPC or two, with a
L> white sandy beach, and shrubbery and palmtrees.  When asked where it was I
L> recall that it was said to be in OOT, but through 2 underwater secret
L> passages.  Where you pass through the first, then are taken out to an
L> opening, then there is another.  Does anyone know of this place?  Heard of
L> it?  Anything?  Or is time for me to just start swimming around with a
L> froggie?

I thank you all for your replies.  I believe that is the island I am
looking for and will go and check it out today. :)  Ive always liked
looking for new and different places, I think that will be my mission for
the next couple of days.  Exploring lots of zones and looking for neat
places.

Thanks!
