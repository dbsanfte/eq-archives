}So last night finally at lvl 25 it suddenly struck me why my spells like
}light heal and skin like rock fizzle so much when others don't.  To this
}point I have been using all my training on fighting type skills and haven't
}put any into alt or abj so of course they are barely working I am a moron.

You shouldn't have to put more than a point in, and even then you only 
have to if you're a hybrid class, I believe.  A ranger is a hybrid, of 
course.  The way to train them up is to pick the cheapest mana and fastest 
casting spell you have of each line, and cast it over and over and over 
until you turn blue.

}I saw that I can become a jeweler which seems like a good trade for my
}character (ranger elf).  So my question is how hard is it to learn a trade
}and where do I go or what do I do to learn.  Thank you in advance for your
}help.

It's not hard to learn one, but very difficult to get it up to a 
very useful level.

Go to www.eqtraders.com and poke about a while.  Everything you will ever 
need to know about trades is there.  Although there's a very pretty chart 
for jewelry at http://eq.castersrealm.com/misc/jewellery/jewel_table.asp
