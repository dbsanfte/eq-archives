Although... playing less than 4 hours at a stretch can be an exercise in 
  futility, and if you can only play for an hour or so because you need 
the phone for well... phone calls then dialup can be a real drag.

Well 'most if not all' should really be amended to "most but not all". 
It lacks the upcoming GoD, as well as LDoN.

Simplest class to play maybe because there is the least to it, but 
easiest? Far from it. The early heavy reliance on other classes makes it 
a difficult class, particularly if you want to do something more 
interesting than hang out leeching xp from powerleveling twinks for the 
first several weeks/months.

I'd recommend a druid, shaman, necro, mage, monk, or beastlord as good 
first choices. They are more complicated, sure, but they're stronger 
soloers, and for a newbie the early to mid game is going to be either go 
solo or hang out as an ineffective xp leech in Paludal Caverns etc...
