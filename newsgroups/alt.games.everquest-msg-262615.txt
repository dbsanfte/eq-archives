So has the US... and you can't even manage to resolve some niggly bit 
that some extremists have interpreted gives them the right to wander the 
streets with assault weapons.

Constitutions are *designed* to be difficult and tedious to change.

Strange that the US can't seem to learn its own lesson.

Besides why would any politian go out of their way to change something 
like a 'we won't go to war' clause; it would be a political lost cause. 
Who's going to make that a platform for election, especially at a time 
when war is not imminent? War is never popular, you don't have to get 
nuked to be anti-war.

The Italian government sanctions their fishermen to fish in American 
waters. Koreans seize US oil tankers in international waters. Mexican 
rebels set up a base of operations in New Mexico. Germany routinely 
violates US airspace. China takes Guam. Iran arrests American tourists 
and imprisons them without trial.

Your response... nuke em all?
