    Hey, at level 59 I still click on the PC to target. ;-) Only F key I use
a lot is F8, to retarget the active mob so I can time a "parting heal" on
the puller better and for stuns.

    This, I don't do. My hotkeys are: sit, fast heal, damageless stun, small
damage stun, MoK, Celestial Elixir. (I play in small screen, and don't
bother with any hotkeys I can't visually confirm.) This alone improves
reaction time a LOT.

    Not truly required. Typing return, OOM, return is quite fast, as is
return, LOM, return. If you have the extra space for hotkeys, consider
hotkeying more spells (if you don't alt-cast them - I don't), or useful
things like /assist.

    What Bergh said. Usually I replace Gate with DB if I'm somewhere where
Gating out would be considered bad form.

    Wanna see my new spell lineup now that I go to Velk's instead of Seb for
XP, Bergh? You'll laugh yourself silly.

DA
Stun (AKA "Unused spell slot number one")
Holy Might (AKA "Unused spell slot number two")
Gate
Celestial Elixir
Remedy
Mark of Karn
Celestial Healing

    The spiders have such a pitiful damage output that Complete Heal is
never needed. I don't bother stunning because of the high Velious resists
and the fact the spiders don't cast. MoK lands very well, considering the
stuns don't land well. And we just sit and harvest the XP and the quest gems
(got three CFEs in seven hours yesterday - yay!) Really, you should
seriously think about getting there before they nerf the place - the spiders
were harder before they got their levels raised, and at some point someone's
going to clue in and put the poison proc back on them.
