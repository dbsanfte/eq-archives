}Somehow this doesn't surprise me.

Statements for times until corpse decay should include the phrase 'a 
minimum of'.  Many a time I've thought a corpse would be gone, and been 
pleasantly suprised.  Many a time someone else's corpse has stuck around 
so long I've been able to use it as a landmark. :)

Once, however, a corpse disappeared what I thought was before its time, 
because I was misled by a typo in the Kunark rulebook, and missed the 
errata on disk.  But a certain kind GM reimbursed my stuff anyway.  Thanks
