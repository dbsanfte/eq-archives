One of my personal favorites...

A healthy mindset! Whenever unsure of what to do, kill the object of
confusion. As good in life as it is in EQ.

As for famous last words, how about...

"Hmm...I wonder where Nagafen is?"


Another quote that requires a little history...

I was in FV and met my guild leader online for the first time. We were
by the bridge out of town, right next to the guards. He was a Wood Elf
and I a Human. I remarked that he was shorter than I thought he would
be, so he cast levitate to make himself "taller". I started jumping to
make myself even taller.

Then he says "oh yeah...watch this!" and proceeded to cast wolf form
on himself. I don't even think he completed casting the spell before
he was dead.


Or how about...

Hello, young traveller. Are you ready for some [adventure]?

a

LOADING...PLEASE WAIT


Oh yeah, the "I am WWWAAADDD" story gets me laughing just thinking
about it.
