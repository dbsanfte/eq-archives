I think Fennin is a good one to call ranged.  Yeah, possible to dodge in and
out of AE, but with all the rangers doing trueshot and wizards going nuts,
you're not really shortening the fight by all that much, while increasing
the risk quite a bit.

We used to do TZ in the RZ script as a ranged fight, and sometimes I wish we
still did (somebody always turning him around and killing a dozen people),
but he does go down a lot faster with the melee working since all the
rangers will be saving trueshot for RZ himself.  TZ standalone pretty much
has to be a ranged fight, though I have spent some (pointless) time chasing
him around instead of doing my (pointless) monk range damage.  =)

I can't imagine doing anything in the Carprin cycle as ranged either.  Yeah,
they put out some massive damage (particularly when you're first
encountering them), but it's all focused on the MT who can't stand at range
anyway.

Agnarr is an odd one to call ranged on.  The guy *before* Agnarr we still do
as a ranged fight.
