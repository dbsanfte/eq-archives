Whoah that magazine version would suck then, basically everyone else
on it would also be 10 day players and newbs which is a pretty bad way
to get a feel for the game. I mean even when I got in the beta around
phase 3 and then 4, there were players who got as high as 50 and you
saw people in steel plate and different colored robes running around
looking uber and casting cool spells. If I had only played on a 10 day
server with newbs all in patchwork beating on rats and beetles, I
would have never bought the game.

I know why they did not allow access to the regular servers, think
about it.. 10 day trial for more or less free if you bought computer
gaming world to cause trouble without having ot put down your name or
give a credit card number.
