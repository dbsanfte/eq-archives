As a dual box?  

I've run an enchanter to 30, its a busy class.  As with a bard,
to get the full benefit out of it, you have to stay on top of
things.  I'm not an experienced dual boxer, and I won't really
have two computers running anyway, just two instances of EQ in
windows.

Thus, the principle benefits I'd see from an enchanter would be
mana regen, slow, and haste.  Shaman has best slow in game and
second best haste.  Mana regen, like it or not, can be purchased
cheaply and easily once you hit 45.

Further, half my consideration resides in benefits the class
might offer my main while he's lower level; ooh, I'm thinking, I
can breeze my mage, then later clarity my mage... only if I just
apply myself a bit my mage will be at KEI level and won't care
about those lesser buffs anymore.

So while I can surely concur with you that mana is one of the
less important benefits a chanter can offer as a rule, its really
the main thing I'd expect to get out of my unskilled and ill (RL)
geared dual boxing the class!

Splendid
