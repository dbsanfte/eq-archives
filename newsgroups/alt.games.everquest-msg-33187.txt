Never actually timed it, but if the mob didn't get killed
for some reason he has to despawn before the dog will head
out i believe.  So say you try to do the quest and the dumb
dog gets killed by a group of scarecrows, you have to wait
for the barbarian mob do despawn before the dog will leave
again.  If you can take a tracker with you it's much easier,
as the dog can get killed etc.
