"Requires" is a strong term.  I only recently got to a level where
I could try GE, and I ended up grouping there as a two-boxed pair
of 55s (mnk/cle) and a 62 bst who invited me to join him.  We went
to a courtyard and pulled from there plus up to two rooms away, and
that was plenty for us, and the cle/bst could sit and med while the
monk pulled.

Anyway, I agree that roaming is more fun; everyone sees more of the
area, tactics can vary, etc.  But sitting does tend to "work better",
not just for grinding, but also by letting the casters med, etc., so
it does tend to be the norm.  Still, I'll add something about the
pros and cons in the FAQ; thanks!

Yes, Warrior agro management at lower levels is more problematic.
I'll add a remark on that as well.

Or at least, you have an alternative, for a price.  I'll add a note.

Noted.

That's all I said: rangers are not a preferred tank class, but can
make do.

Is this still as effective since the charm nerf?

Anyway, I'll file your points away for next month's update to the FAQ.
Thanks for the detailed reply!
