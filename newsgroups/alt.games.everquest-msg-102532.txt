Now we know the "real" reason for the price increase:  Sony has to hire more
lawyers to fight a frivolous lawsuit!
</sarcasm>

On a more serious note, I couldn't agree more with your post.  I was about
as close to enraged as I ever get after reading the article.  The nerve of
these people is un-fucking-believable.  The same can be said of the suit
being brought against any corporation that happened to be around during
times of slavery in the U.S.  How much fucking money and courts' time will
be wasted before people realize YOU DO NOT FUCKING DESERVE SOMETHING FOR
NOTHING!
