I want to upgrade my 3D card and was wondering if I could get some
suggestionbs. I want a geforce 3 card.  What's the difference between the
ti500 and the ti 200?  Is the extra price for the ti500 stuff worth it?
Also, does it matter which brand of geforce I get?  Any to stay away from?
Any help, or any links to sites which have some good information and reviews
would be a huge help.

Thanks so much!
