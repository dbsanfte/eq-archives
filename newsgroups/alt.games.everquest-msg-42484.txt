Good magic resistance but poor AC. Save it for your resist gear
but get at least Crafted, or get a Tattered mantle.

Straw spun belt? AC 10, decent there.

Get a Fine Plate Visor AC 7, at least.

Good AC but you should have Plat or Velium Fire Opal rings here.
The extra 110 or 130 hp are worth it in the long run.

You can get some cheap upgrades to your armor. I'd do that first
then save up for the Lammy.
