Nice tale.  =)

Pacify will, indeed, work on separating a named from its surrounding mobs;
I've done it many a time before.  However, this is with a level 65 spell;
I'm certain the level 30ish equivalents don't have nearly the same
effectiveness, especially since you're fighting mobs nearer to your level.

Also, the Tenth Ring War is great for getting faction if you ever wanna get
+CoV and +Thurg faction.  Just memories your lowest-level nuke and cast it
on every mob in sight.  You won't get aggro but you'll be added to the hate
list and get the faction when the mob dies.  I brought my alt to a ring war
once and we went from dubious to the dwarves to warmly in that one battle.

Sounds like you're learning all the right things about your wizard, keep it
up.  =)
