I had serious problems with a few of the quests, but
http://www.gry-online.pl/eq2/maps.asp?ID=6 seems to cover a lot of them,
including decent maps and npc locations. I think the journal is sometimes
wrong, and sometimes inadequate, and that there was a lot reported in beta
they shouldn't have ignored before going live, but I'm disengaged from
roleplaying and am just playing to bash things and go for shinies, and it
works ok.

If they fix things up better, I'll roleplay again, but having been a hot
potato, and chucked from gm's to devs to the too-hard basket, i've gotten a
little cynical. That said, whilst I'm keeping an eye out for WoW, i love EQ2
most of the time. The art and characterisation is superb and i think there's
a lot of talented people here.

Now if only they allowed offline trading! And fixed up the betrayal quest so
that you were level capped as soon as you accepted it, or at least made it
unlimited for level... after all, redemption and corruption can occur to
young and old alike.

p.s. any casual family guilds on najena? pref Australian?
