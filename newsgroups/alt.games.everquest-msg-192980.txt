The guy was full of crap.  Loot spawns when the monster spawns.  Depending
on the loot, it can be visible on the monster carrying it before you attack
it (NPC type monsters carrying weapons, shardwurms carrying glowing bile,
etc.).

You'll get bat wings off the bats you kill at the same rate as anyone else
killing them would, subject to the random number generator's idiosyncrasies,
of course.
