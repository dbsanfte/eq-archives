You're seriously overblowing things. One big purpose of guilds is for
people to work together for the benefit of the group. There's
absolutely nothing wrong with giving guilds more material goals to
work for that benefit the group. This will not stop those who want to
group outside their guild from doing so, and it won't punish those who
don't.

Humans are "tribal" creatures, anyway. They tend to be most
comfortable with a group of people that they know and don't tend to
"wander from the herd" much. Some do, but for the most part, they
don't. This system is, really, just rewarding natural behavior.
