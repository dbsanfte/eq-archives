Speaking of NPC Summoned pets, has anybody made a trip down to the E.
Freeport Necro guild lately, by way of going in through that abandoned
building and going downstairs?  When you reach the bottom of the stairs,
there's a room with a couple spell merchants and a big hole in the wall
that takes you further down into the tunnels, to more merchants, etc.

Well, anyway, that room at the bottom of the steps has had, for the last
several days now, an invisible pet holding (I believe) a shield and a
weapon. I don't recall the name of the NPC owner (i.e. "So-and-do's
Pet") but the owner was nowhere to be found, and the pet hasn't moved
for days. It conned even to me at level 17 and was indifferent. Hailing
it produced no response. I have not tried attacking it. (Gawd only knows
how powerful it might be, or more importantly, what factions I might
trash, and pets never drop any loot anyway.)

Now I wish I'd written down the name, but it was the pet of an NPC whose
name I didn't recognize from many levels of many characters in Freeport.
Anyone else seen him on other servers, etc. or know what his story is?
