Of course you can do what you wish.... and I usually do go for the
individuals who ask for donation... rather than a donation of a
specific amount.
But, with all groups, clicks, circles..... words and meanings tend to
evolve over time...   Sow for Spirit of Wolf, Billy for er... billy...
then you have real world instances...  
"he is a nice person" --->  He's cool"  Cool? does he need a sweater?
"she's not a nice person" ---> "she's a bitch"  bitch? female dog?

Just as you say some people have taken the word donation as a
euphemism for "better pay me for washing your windows or ill...
ill.... breathe on you"

In the end... its really all about what gets your panties in a wad....
