Where are you now?

Here is the solo area without leaving Qeynos area.

As I play erudite, i usually stay at Blackburrow. At L9 or above, gnolls
become too low (gnolls), too high (guardian, or elite), or too rare (burly)
for your level. But there is some giant snakes, I favor the 3 snakes behide
the opposite side door at the lake. They will flee down the slope at low hp.
You shall have time to kill it, before your pet attract gnolls. These snakes
have no posion, don't worry!

The snake pit and nearby is not suitable for pet class, after the snake flee
patch half-year ago. They usually bring your pet to gnoll guardians, and get
you killed.

If you have good equipments, go erudite crossing! Give your pet some
summoned weapons, camp near ogre, and hunt the wisps. Great xp and loot.
