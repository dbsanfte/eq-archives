The haven book quests only raise that caster guild faction IN haven.

Go in tenebrous and kill the cotiere. I have been killing a 5 spawn or
so solo on my 55 druid (they are light blue to me) They are around a
lil castle looking building near the zone to grimling forest. They are
far enough apart around the campfire that I can single pull them and
fight them high on the zone wall where passing sonics never jump me.
They hit HARD and proc like a 200 damage harm touch like thing A LOT.
So I root them then use my dot on my epic on them and my drones tov
bracer on them then I sit on my ass and re engulfing root them as
needed. They unroot enought that its good damage for my engulfing at
160 damage when I reroot them while not using a lot of mana.

I tried killing them last night with a 55 sk and it was kind of harder
almost. I used a ton more mana since they did kind of a job on the sk
and fearing there would be fairly unsafe. We were basically kiling
them faster but I find it far more relaxing and easy to do alone.
Several characters could probably take the light blue cons easily
there and the couple blue named from the lil buildings.

Killing them raises several katta factions though I'm not sure quite
what the hell ones are which.

There is a shrieking substance quest which I think raises some katta
factions also, though no one in the thread actually states the
factions:

Oh and I got some vampire ash .. and fangs from those cotiere guys and
the ash is in a quest too:

"i'm terribly dissapointed in the award. it took me killing massive
ammounts of the vampires in tenebrous mountains to get 4 vampire
ashes. i was all excited, and what i got was a whopping 8 malachite. 

the quest did not continue.

one word: caca"

If you really don't care about being KOS in seru (sanctus seru)
which is kind of an opposite faction, you can kill a couple apparently
quite low ( to my 55 at least) and with few enough hp that I did not
have time to egress before it died from my dots, legionaires of the
hand or something in Marus seru by the zone into sanctus seru. They
lower several hand factions but also raised some (the seru people are
messed up and hate each other I guess) and I think raised some katta
type factions (dark side light side combine stuff basically.
