An enchanter on Innoruuk just posted a rant to the innoruuk.com forums 
detailing the troubles he has had attempting to get the Shissar head.  
Basically 36 trips, 208 hours in Hate, including 72 hours sitting in the 
temple solo.  He's even had Cazic spawn on top of him 3 times.  I would 
say that this is the real roadblock for the Shissar sticky.
