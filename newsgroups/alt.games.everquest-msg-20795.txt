The game has been out 2+ years and there are 400,000 subscribers, and every
time this subject comes up it's shot down.

Everquest is aimed at mature players.  Mature players have no problem
following the naming rules...hell, I'd venture to say that the majority
would say that they think the naming policies actually ADD to the game.

To me, saying that the naming policy is stupid is just like saying the
LANGUAGE policy is stupid (say "fuck" or "shit" after I suggest you NOT use
childish language and I'll /report /petition and start looking for a guild
officer if you have one).

And, quite frankly, I don't give a damn what immature players think about
the rules.  That's not a flame, I don't know you well enough to know if
you're immature.  I do know you well enough to know that either you haven't
been playing very long and don't know that a good chunk of folks like the
idea of naming rules, or you HAVE been playing long enough, but want to
whine about it.
