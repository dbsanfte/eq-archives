It depends.  Grey could be one level below XP range.
Would you have expected to win the same fight if
they were green?   More to the point, those mobs
were grey to a *group* of your level.  There's no
way (currently) to differentiate con based on
group/solo content -- a group mob that's green
to level 18 is green to level 18, easy for a group
of 18s and a lot tougher for a solo 18.

(That's a change I'd like to see -- group mobs
changing to solo mobs and remaining green
longer...)

The other issue is spells/abilities and gear, of course.
Using all App I (or App II) abilities and grey gear
means you're not as powerful as the average level X
and therefore just about every mob is an "undercon"
to you.

Bottom line:  con is an estimate, not a guarantee...
