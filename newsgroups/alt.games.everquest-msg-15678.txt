Sounds reasonable to me.
You think managing a guild of 80+ people is easy?
Generally to make a guild "reasonable" in terms of size, you want the
upper cap around 50 people.  If you're only going to have that many
and you want to be able to do the end game encounters, you HAVE TO
restrict the classes to those that are required for those encounters.
