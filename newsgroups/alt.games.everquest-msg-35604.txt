They were a constant 6k for the longest time on my server,
then suddenly they had crashed to 2k and have held there
for a while.

Does anyone know what drove this change?  I know it can't
be supply exceeding demand, the quest components (especially
the Gold Ring) are still a major drag to get, while new
Druids are a dime a dozen.

Has it been overshadowed by a new handheld item with
better stats?
