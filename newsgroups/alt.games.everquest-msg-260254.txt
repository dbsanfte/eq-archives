Almost right. Shaman dots generally stack. Necro dots generally stack. 
Druid dots generally stack. Enchanter dots never stack.

The 'key' to dot stacking is, is it just a dot?
If it's a dot+debuff, like the enchanter dots, and a few of the necro 
dots (that snare), and dunno about druid/shaman, then they will not 
stack. Same caster, different caster, different spell, doesn't matter.
