No, it's even worse than that as it is AFAIK the ONLY snare spell in
the game that can 'break' early, if you get three ticks out of it
you're doing well.  The Necro/Snare line may be sucktastic in a lot of
regards but at least it won't break once on!

As for TW they smashed it hard several times with the NerfHammer
(check all the changes on Lucy if you're interested) since it first
appeared in game, my theory is that they were testing
snares-with-root-properties with a view to implementing an entire line
and then decided against doing anything further in that direction.
One of their smarter moves.
