1.  The game is still very unstable, I have had 6 out right crashes from EQ
in the last 2 days and uncountable lock-ups and disconnects.

2.  Textures are still not right most armor is missing and some of that
which is present lacks any texture.  Many characters are still nude or are
missing significant parts of their armor.

3.  The game still loads slowly taking between 7 and 10 minutes to reach the
playing window, and is prone to lock up and crash during the process.  On
the plus side zoning seems much easier now.

4.  Characters seem hard to control from the keyboard, turning takes far to
long and there are a few mouse related problems as well.

Conclusion the game has made a good start over the last two days but has a
very long way to go before it is safe to risk high level characters in
combat.
