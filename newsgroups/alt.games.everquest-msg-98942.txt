One big issue not worked out as of yet...
I have all my macros doing statements.... so I can just change the
default channel Im talking in.... welp there is no way to change to
the default Chat channel...   
I could rewrite my macros... but If I set em up to do this in channel
1.... I will not be able to do in any other channel.

Somethign they need to look at in my minds eye, but they are walking
in the right direction.
