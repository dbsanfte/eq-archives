The implementation is way too complex.  Here's a way they can do it a lot
simpler:

1. When character logs in, load saved XP value, and figure out where
they are on the current XP table.

2. Convert that number to the equivalent place on the new non-penalty
table for their race and class.

3. Do all the in-game calculations using that converted number and the
non-penalty table.

4. Whenever the XP value is saved (periodic save or when the character
logs out), convert back to the equivalent place on the old XP table.
