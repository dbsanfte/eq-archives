If you wanna do tailoring, learn to smith and brew. Youll need brewing 
to make kiolas and tannins, and smithign to make studs and bonings too.
Since youll need better tannins and better studs/bonings later on, youll 
just as well learn it yourself, unless you want a smith to earn a LOT of 
money from you for making them.
