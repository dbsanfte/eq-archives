Not at all. It's wise to be certain that you want to make an
investment in advance.

It is, it is!

It costs $9.89 USD to play per month. I have no clue what that
translates into in your local currency, but it equates to about the
cost of a couple of burgers, chips and a beer.

>is there any demo or 'trial' period for everquest?

The first month subscription to the game is free. Unfortunately, you
do have to purchase the actual game to take advantage of this free
month.

If you look around, you should be able to find the basic EQ game for
about $10 somewhere - in other words, two more burgers, chips and
another beer.

Look at it as an investment in good dietary practice :)
