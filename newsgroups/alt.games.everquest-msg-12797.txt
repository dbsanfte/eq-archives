I was talking about soloing tactics. I'm aware that everyone can solo
at these levels.

You re-charm critters? I haven't had to do that really. Generally the
pet is near death by the time charm breaks, and ready to get killed
anyway. In the cases where it isn't, stun, mez, mem blur will take
care of mobs you don't want to fight. I also try to charm mobs that
don't agro naturally, like oasis crocs. One mem blur and they forget
all about you.

Whatever floats your boat dude. IMO, charm is the defining ability for
chanters. Your comment is much like wizards saying they never use area
effect spells. Why play the class if you hate the class defining
ability?

I agree with you that soloing is slower exp, and riskier than
grouping. However, the original poster was specifically asking about
soloing his chanter. Also, sow is not required to do the charm
soloing, it just makes it practically risk free. I prefer to have a
sow if I'm solo going up against a whole camp of mean mobs, but if I'm
just using charm to kill random wandering mobs, it's not needed.

Granted, charm soloing is not for people playing on auto-pilot. You
actually have to think about what you are doing. If you are aware of
the risks, and play alertly, it can pay off though.

You never expect charm to stick for ANY length of time, and play
accordingly. I.e. stay far away from your charmed mob, and what it is
fighting. You need time to react if charm breaks.

Again, grouping is where it's at, I agree. If you want to solo your
chanter though, using charm can be really cool. It's shortsighted to
just give up on the spell because it got resisted or didn't last as
long as you wanted. Root does the same thing, but people still use it.
Besides all the other arguments, I find it is a FUN way to play.
Certainly a lot more interesting than soloing a lot of other classes.
