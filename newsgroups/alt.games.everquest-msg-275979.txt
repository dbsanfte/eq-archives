I have two very different feelings about logs/parsing.  If I'm in a
group that I don't know people (increasingly rare, especially at higher
levels) and somebody says they are parsing, I don't do anything
special.  Sometimes I may even lower my DPS some, just because I don't
know if they have an agenda.  There is so much finger-pointing and nerf
calling on the forums, it is disgusting.  I'd rather not feed the fire,
whether I agree with it or not.

If I'm in a group with my friends and somebody turns on a parser, we
generally go all out and see who can beat who.  It is really fun with a
bunch of DPS trying to out damage each other, yet keep from getting
agro.  The heckling that goes on can't help but make somebody smile ;)

There are two parsers that I know of - Statalyzer (which was mentioned)
and a different one that is better for just plain combat called
(surprisingly enough) CombatStats - http://www.combatstats.com.  You
enter the names of your group and then tell it when to start keeping
track and when to stop.  It then lists the highest hit, what it was and
from who, the total damage and DPS from the group and the damage the
group took.  Then it lists the group members (in order of DPS) with the
damage given, damage received and DPS.

That said, I use Statalyzer and only because it lists out the
conversations I have if I ever need to refer to them again.  I haven't
downloaded and messed with CombatStats, I just leave that for my
friends :P
