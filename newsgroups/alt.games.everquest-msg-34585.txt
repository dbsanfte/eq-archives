Why would they be?  No guild I've been in or heard of (obviously I haven't
"heard of" the vast majority, of course) requires the ok of every single
member by every single officer.  I've been in 3 guilds.  The first required
one sponsor.  The second, 2.  The guild I'm a leader of now requires just 2,
and any of the leaders (we have 4, RL friends) will guild them.  The only
time a leader (or, eventually, officers) would be consulted at all would be
if we knew the recruit from before and didn't like them, and that would be
after the fact.
