You miss the point, they're not invading the homeland, they are
visiting the land of their god.  There are quests for Tunare
worshippers there, and they sort of require you to be in the zone.
How is the poor tree-hugger to know that the SK begging for a buff
isn't there to give Tunare a hug, but rather to chop down every tree
in the zone?  
The way that buffs work generally is that you don't take faction hits
for buffs cast unless the buffee is currently on the aggro list.  I
think just about every PoG hunt I've been on has had a druid/ranger
along to scout and buff every now and then.  I know that we would be
upset if one of our druids were to lose their faction, especially
without getting a faction hit message.  I've noticed that faction gets
really, really screwy when you start dealing with lag within a server.
If I do a /who all <> and it takes a while to respond, like more than
a second, then I end up getting random faction hits that I can't
attribute to anything.  It might be a place to at least start looking
for the problem.

treehuggers, bah!  Timber!
