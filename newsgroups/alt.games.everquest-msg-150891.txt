Couldn't log into the bazaar, just got a blank screen after cha select.
Emptied my skin 1 folder so that default would load. Managed to log in.
Whoohoo!
Clicked on my /bazaar hotkey, and boom, screen locks up. Bah!
Only 146 traders were in the bazaar when I could get on.
Below is the Response from CS. I would try the things they suggest but I
lock up while typing.
Doctor Jekyll-Verant gaves us the newUI, bazaar and trader options. Pity
about mister Mr. Hide-Verant.

"This has not been fully tested yet, but we have gotten good feedback, so I
wanted to pass it along.
If you are locking up in the bazaar, open your EverQuest folder (usually
C:\Program Files\EverQuest or C:\Program Files\Sony\EverQuest Trilogy) and
delete the new SpellEffects folder. After doing this, log into the Test
Server. Log out of Test and back into EQ.

Beyond that, we are looking at the lockups and hope to have a resolution out
to all of you soon.

Also, type in /filter to get around the other lockup, which seems to be
caused by an error in the item links in the bazaar.

So far, as I said, I'm just gathering information and trying to pass it
around until the real fix (another patch) hits. I haven't heard anything
about it, but we are expecting one.
As shakana said, the command is actually /filter badword

Another possiblity to get you in and playing (though I have heard limited
feedback on this one) is to type in /showspelleffects off.

If we learn anything further, I'll pass it along. As I said, none of these
are guaranteed. Just things we are hearing feedback about that may get you
back in the game until the issues are resolved.
