Ok, I've used windows 2k for a while now at work, but never for gaming.

I finally took the plunge and reinstalled my home machines with win2k pro,
however the results are dissapointing to say the least.

P4 1.8gig, geforce 3 64mb, 640mb sd ram, it runs HORRIBLY.

Zoning is 10x what it was on win98, logging into the game is a horribly long
ordeal, my p3 700 with a shitty geforce mmx (also win2k) runs 2 chars almost
better than this runs 1 char.

Even with just 1 EQ session running, if I try and access a webpage the
system is very very slow to alt/tab, and even to load the page.

Its almost unplayable, which considering its spec is pissing me off.

The only things installed on the machine are
win2k
Vga/mboard drivers
Direct X 8.1
EQ
IcqLite

Not another single program is installed on it.

Im thinking maybe I need to tweak something here or there (tho why the other
machine is working ok with the exact same install is a mystery)

Help!
