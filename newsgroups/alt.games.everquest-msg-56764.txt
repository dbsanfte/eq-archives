I have to go monkey, Heres my reasons.

Indoors or out you dont have a puller that can do half what the monkey can do
with out relying heavly on your chanty keeping you alive. 

If you score the Druid you got your speed, and the chanty/cleric buffs.

The monk if played right will out damg the warrior and still not pull agro from
him (warrior hopefully has a decent weapon) meaning if the group learns agro
control fast you can solo high reds left and right all day because the clerics
only got to deal with healing the tank.

The bard isnt going to bring the damg. out put with him/her.
