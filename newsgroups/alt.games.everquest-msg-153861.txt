    CH isn't broken. The designers are. Here are some ways to "break" a CH
chain strategy:

    (1) Mobs with the ability to produce high damage spikes. AoW's flurries
and the 4 K DD from Emperor in Ssra are examples. For AoW, the CH chain
solution was to make a CH chain so tight that any foul-up would kill the
tank. For Emperor, you must plan healing for the 4 K DD (and there is a way
to do this).
    (2) Mobs that switch targets often. If a mob can't be controlled onto a
limited subset of targets, you can't CH chain against the mob - the ten
second delay will kill the tank. Relaxing proximity aggro would be one way
to get mobs to bounce around a bit more.
    (3) Mobs whose primary damage output isn't single target. I tanked
Trakanon last night when we found him up and he aggroed on me during the
following raid. But what nearly killed many of our people was his AoE - THAT
was the healing challenge. Bring back mobs with fearsome AoE's, and lower
melee abilities, and you've changed how healing will work on those
encounters.
    (4) Reduce the efficiency of CH. This is my own pet idea, so make fun of
it as a "pie-in-the-sky" notion. Right now, the reason that people can mod
without low-health aggro and CH chains are so efficient on main tanks is
because of the HPs everyone has. So have mobs with abilities like the
following:

    The Viscid Boss of Plane X procs a negative buff onto players he hits,
Evil Buff From The Viscid Boss. EBFTVB lowers the base hit points of
whomever it lands on by 6000, but cannot be applied multiple times (it
bounces). This effect cannot be removed by Annul Magic, cure disease/poison,
remove curse etc. - just by time. It has no stacking conflicts that can
prevent it from landing. The proc rate for this effect should be similar to
the pre-nerf cleric hammer, the idea being if he swings at you it'll land.

    So now if low-HP people get aggro, they die. Period. The "main tank" has
6000 less HPs, meaning your healers will have to use fast heals if they want
to keep him from dying (you can tune mob damage output to the expected HPs
of the tank post-proc). And when it comes to fast heals, clerics and druids
are a lot more balanced. This also serves as an anti-Zerg measure - if a
guild cannot field tanks with good enough gear to overcome a 6000 HP
deficit, they cannot hope to succeed at the encounter. If the mob also does
an AoE which drops everyone else down by 2000 HPs, you have greatly
eliminated the ability of casters to mod with impunity (and you again
eliminate the ability to zerg rush with underequipped folks).

    This idea scales. You can make the AoE 1 K, or 4 K, or whatever you
want. And guilds will HAVE to get everyone they want at the encounter above
that mark for them to participate. Likewise with the main proc - no matter
how good the gear of the main tank, you can design a mob that requires him
to be healed by fast healing. Best of all, as the gear level of a guild
increases they will see a shift in what heals they can use to heal their
main tank. At the start of the expansion the main tank might only have 1500
HPs after EBFTVB. Later on, once geared up, they may have 5500 HPs and CH
will again become the best way to heal. So the actual healing strategies
against mobs will change with time. Right now, all that changes is the CH
interval.

    See how easy it was to think of ways to break reliance on a CH chain, or
at least make a CH chain a minor part of an overall healing strategy? But VI
can't seem to do any of these things. I leave it up to the reader to
speculate why.
