This'll be fun. You're comparing something that -does- affect me with
something that -does not- affect me.

If someone takes money from my bank account, the effect is I'm a hobo, and I
play Russian Roulette on the streets for sandwiches.

If someone exploits pathing errors in order to level up faster, I say,
"Damnit."

Whew, man... let me tell you... it's really worth getting pissy about.

I understand that some people take everything differently from others, but
damn, to get angry about something that doesn't concern you is ridiculous.

Now if someone was caught duplicating items, I would understand
completely... but that's a different matter all together.
