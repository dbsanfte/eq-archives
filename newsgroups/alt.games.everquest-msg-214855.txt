I now have a beastlord of every race, and so far am starting to like the
Iksar the best. Hope to ding 9 with him on Drinal tonight. The only real
differences I see so far is that the Ogre can solo yellows the easiest,
followed by the Troll, Iksar and Vah Shir. Ny Barbarian on Firiona Vie
has major difficulties even with dark blues. I have no idea why this is
so, as they are all similarly equipped, and post level 7 have all gone
the Paludal route, so theoretically are fighting the same creatures.
