Not only are the is the difficulty out of whack, it's not as good as other
epics either. As a Time bard with an ED and Songblade, while I could complete
the quest I don't feel like using that much of my guild's time for what would
be a marginal upgrade. The ratio on epic is worse than songblade, although
I'm sure it will outdamage it with two proc augs. It will however not
outdamage ED - nothing will except for Spiked Steel Baton, the upgraded ED
from Txevu. Sony designers never understood what a 750 DD proc does for a
class on such a low damage table as a bard.

So what would Epic 1.5 give me? A stat upgrade, some stun resistance,
instrument mods that I either need to have duplicates of or get locked into
keeping one item again (hello, epic 1.0 ball and chain!). Plus a clicky that
has been parsed as doing nothing as much as wasting a buff slot.
