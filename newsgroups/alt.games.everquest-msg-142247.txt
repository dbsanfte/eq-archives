Hmm, ok.  A bunch of merchants and landholders got together to assert
that all men (note that these men were quite deliberate in specifying
men, as opposed to people, or men and women) had the right to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of wealth (oops, better change wealth to
happiness in the final draft), and claimed that these rights were
part of being "Created" which was a clear religious reference.

Then, a number of years later, a similar group of men (some men
were in both groups) agreed on a document defining the basis for a
goverment (the U.S. Constitution) and another document detailing 10
amendments to the first document (the Bill of Rights).

Note the difference between what you said and recorded history.
I don't think I'll be relying on you for any information in the
future.
