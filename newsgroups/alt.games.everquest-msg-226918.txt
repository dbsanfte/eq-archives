Sorry, no.   Raids in EQ do not work that way.  More participation does not
mean more rewards on average, without some kind of loot system.   For a
simple example, Hate and Fear in the old days.   Two clerics in the same
guild, Cleric A works nights and cannot attend the Wednesday Hate raid, but
can make every Saturday Fear raid.   Cleric B works normal hours, but does
not play as much.   He attends no fear raids, but manages to make 1/4 of the
Hate raids.   It is physicly impossible for Cleric A to be rewarded more
than Cleric B... since even though he raids more often, the zone he raids
*does not drop any cleric armor.*

It also does not reward anyone for doing an encounter again once they
already have the drop from it.  A cleric who continues to raid IV after
having the FT2 neck can get nothing more out of the encounter.   Even though
he raids that a lot more than another cleric, helping other guildmembers get
geared up... his maximum total loot potential is exactly the same as the
second cleric who comes once, gets lucky on his drop (or gets it as the last
one who doesn't have it) and leaves.

*sigh*  I seem to remember having this discussion with you before.   If all
of your responces are going to center around "In a perfect guild in a
perfect world" again... just say so and we can end it right away.
