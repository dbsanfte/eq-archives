Shield of bane warding is a good upgrade to the sarnak.
Fairly easy quest just long, you will need one good group in their
50s to complete some parts of the quest. Quest in Katta Castellum.
Will give you +20 wisdom and +12 magic. If you got that
then:

My personal favorite are the Player jeweler made Velium Jade rings:
AC 5 +30 mana and +30 hit points. Once you are above 200
wisdom you only get about 5-6 mana per wisdom point. So
you are only losing about 24 mana to gain 10 AC and 60 hit
points if you wear both rings. Or pick up a Shadel Bandit Ring  +6 AC
+5 vsCold +10 vsDis +55 HP +55 Mana +0.50 Wt   from
Fungus Grove or buy one, goes for 3-5k on my server usually.

See if you can pick up an Amulet of Insight it has Extended
enhancement 3 which increases buff duration by 15%. I
got lucky and picked up one cheap in the bazaar. Must have item
for a cleric in my opinion. =)

I'd go for Coldain Skin Gloves  +12 AC +9 Sta +6 Wis +6 Int +20 HP
 +20 Mana +1.50 . Less AC than the CC gaunts but more mana
and hit points, unless you really need the AC and strength of the
CC gaunts. These go for 3-4k on my server usually.
