Head over to Kurns tower until around 19 or 20, then PC then at 24 or 25
head to echo caverns and kill Needlites.

You wont make much in the way of cash until the needlites but you should be
30 within a day or two.
Oh and be careful if the queen pops she has a powerful DoT that will take
you down fast, if you ask nice their is usually a higher level in the zone
willing to take her out for you.

Just pull in an anti-clockwise direction (facing into the room) use your
Slow, self haste, and most importantly your Damage sheild.
I love this zone these guys hit fast and I mean really fast but it will max
out your defense skill nicely.

The PH for the queen can't be single pulled without your harmony song so I
tend to either leave them alone (stops the nasty queen popping) or use the
Charm song to kill each other.

This zone is super fast exp, and very easy to solo if your a DS class ...
Hope this helps you some.
