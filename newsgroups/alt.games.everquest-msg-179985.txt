Hello All;

I'm a newbie level 6 Hafling Cleric.  Occasionally I'll find beer on a mob.
There are skills for brewing and skill points for alcohol tolerance (or
something like that).  My question:  What or why is there all this booze
sold at vendors, skills to improve tolerance (or whatever), booze loot, etc.
I'm certainly not against booze (I'm a beer freak personally). But what
purpose does it serve in the game?  Does getting drunk help your stats?
Anything you can tell me about this issue would be appreciated. My wife was
looking over my shoulder last night and laughing, wondering if I get a bunch
of beer can I throw some kind of drunken party????

Thanks in advance for your time in answering my questions.

Doctorzoid.
