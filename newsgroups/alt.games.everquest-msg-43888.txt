Both.

Now, if you bring up *JUST* 24 people (or less) yes PoA can actually
be interesting (although these days 24 would be tremendous overkill).

Unfortunately, rarely do guilds bring just 24 or under and since CoH
doesn't work (which is incredibly stupid while summon corpse
does...whereas in Velious zones summon corpse doesn't but CoH
does...what the logic is behind this I have no idea), you have sick
freaking time waiting on people.

A few times, I've had to entertain myself with "What strange things"
even knowing what that would mean.

Take 12, go to the 7th or 8th island (I forget, it's been too long),
clearing everything along the way, if you can kill the overgrown
bixies (hell even if you can't), it might be fun.
