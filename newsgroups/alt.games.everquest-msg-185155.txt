Sounds like youve been unlucky on the FS drop rate. You could try hunting
crags in EK. They drop a ton of silk which should sell fast in bazaar. They
are lvl 20, so should be blue up till about 26. You often get people
auctioning to buy silk in EK too. Just make sure to kite them, they have
pretty nasty poison for a lvl 20 mob.
