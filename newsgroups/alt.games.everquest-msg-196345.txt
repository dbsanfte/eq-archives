I think that I can guess just what thread you are referring to, let's
check google for exact quotes, shall we?
In the thread "Re: Cringely on ShowEQ (v. interesting)", first post
shown is from "Happy99 (loveme@hotmail.com)" in reply to a post by
"David Navarro" (hmm, you have no-archive set too David?).  All that
in case anybody else wants to go back an review, now on to the good
stuff...

Well, I'm not the sort to defend repulicans, and yet, when you post
"Next you'll be telling me that thieves are just doing their part..."
it sure as hell looks to me like you are approaching accusing him of
defending thievery.  You are certainly, given the context, trying to
create an equivalency in the reader's mind between what was said by
the other poster and what you said.  The "equally absurd" BS you posted
in response to Gary's reply to you is pretty weak given the context,
as well you must know give the knowledge and skill at argument you have
shown in many other threads.  The choice of what to compare to Gary's
words was yours, denying that it represents a deliberate attempt to
smear him by encouraging readers to infer that he is "defending
thievery" is BS and you know it.  Next you're gonna tell us that
the thinly veiled smear campaigns pursued via "issue" ads are not
about the elections they precede.

Oh no, I do not forget.  Of all your posts to this group only in that
particular thread have you given me reason to have anything other than
a very high regard for your intelligence and integrity.  Let us go on
to what you referred to just now, shall we?

I hope you will forgive me for snipping the above quoted material

Nor did I claim that you were accusing him of defending thievery.
I will say again, however, that you encouraged readers of your post
infer that he was doing so.  And, given your posting history, I can
only assume that it was done deliberately.  You have shown yourself
to be one of the most accomplished wordsmiths who posts here, I just
cannot believe that you didn't know exactly what you were doing when
you made that post.

 > Hell he didn't even mention thievery.

No he didn't, you did.  Which is very much to the point.

 > You all are welcome to

And all I know about you I've learned from your posts here.  Your
claims of innocence in this regard don't square with what I've
come to expect from you, sorry.  This isn't a criminal court, no
amount of slippery "logic" is gonna create a "reasonable doubt".

First, the hyperbole of 6 billion wasn't all that hyperbolic, Ed
was referring to the general population.

Second, I made no reference to emotional content in the ShowEQ thread.

Finally, I stand by my posts to that thread.  There is no reasonable
way I can see to read what you posted except as an attempt to create
in readers' minds an equivalence between Gary Beldon's claim that some
ShowEQ users were motivated to "give back to the community" and your
"thieves are just doing their part to keep the economy moving..." bit.
Your subsequent rather bizarre attempt to attack Dan Day with "Don't
you have a republican to defend somewhere with bs like that?" when he
called you on it, and the thrashing you engaged in when I pointed out
that defending republicans had nothing to do with it, stand apart from
every other post of yours I've read.  Given the occasions where you
held up others' attempts to squirm out of the obvious implications of
their words, or where you poked and prodded at others' illogic (like
the way you deflated my flight of fancy re: Likespotatos, which is the
funniest thing I've ever read in this group even tho I was the butt of
the joke, I simply cannot understand your insitence that we should all
believe that black is green and blue is yellow in this particular case.

sincerely and with respect,
Kaev
