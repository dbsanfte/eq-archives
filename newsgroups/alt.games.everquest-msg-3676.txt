Most comparable weapons cost 100 pp and up, like the Silvery War Axe
(6 22, 100 pp) for instance. Even inferior weapons sell in this range,
like the Blade of Passage (7 35 +20 hps, 100 pp). Weapons like Bladed
Thulian Claws (5 19, 170 pp) and Brazen Brass Kilij (10 35, 220 pp)
are no better than the Langseax, even at 10 times the price. The only
cheap 1hs upgrade to a Langseax I could find is the Crystal Fiber (8
26, 170 pp), a very good deal, pretty close to the warrior mainstay, a
Short Sword of the Ykesha (8 24, 1700 pp). Of course the Ykesha has a
75 point dd proc after level 36, but they are quite close otherwise.

The Langseax is really all you need until level 30 or so, but keep an
ear open for a Crystal Fiber, and maybe look for a Wraithbone Hammer
(8 26, 800 pp) for 1hb later on. I only upgraded my Langseax to a
Kunzar Ku'juch (8 22, 4,600 pp) at level 34. Of course I didn't know
about the Crystal Fiber, or I would have upgraded sooner.

Suden, 35 warrior.
