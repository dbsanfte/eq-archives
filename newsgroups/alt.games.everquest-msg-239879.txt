Resurrection effects, think of it as the headache you get from being 
knocked out that makes you sit there like a rock wishing you were dead 
again. The gain xp part is the restoration of any experience points you 
lost [is it 5% or 10% per level/] when you die over the level of 10. My 
best rez will restore 96% of these experience points that you would 
otherwise loose so you only have to hunt to replace 4% of the experience 
points you lost that I cannot replace.

Not malicious at all, I frequently stop if i see a body and see if they 
want a rez=)
