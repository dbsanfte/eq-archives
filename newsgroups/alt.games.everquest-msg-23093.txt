Usenet posters and high level players are not necessarily the same.

Understand, and make no mistake, JS's post was ridiculed not merely on
the basis of his poor language skills - this group regularly has
non-native posters, and they're as welcome as anyone. The post was
ridiculed not on grounds of intelligence, but rather of laziness.

Frankly, you're better at it than most native English speakers.

Again, don't confuse the game with the newsgroup.

You're certainly right about the game and social aspects. But in any
community, people will be judged by what is known of them, and reacted
to accordingly. In Usenet, the only thing that is relevant is one's
posts.

Thanks for the compliments, and I understand your point. All I can say
in response is that (like everyone, no doubt) I'm a far more complex
person than can be expressed in either Usenet posts or photographs.

A good comment, and certainly a worthy ideal.
