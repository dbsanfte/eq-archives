Check the hard drive space, you might be running too low to sustain a temp
file

Before starting the game, close any other programs that might be running, in
particular stuff down by the clock such as Seti @ Home, MSN messenger, ICQ,
printer drivers and just about anything else, you can also alt+ctrl+delete
and close anything in there that you don't need (keep Explorer up, and a
couple other things that are required to run Windows)

Also, update your virus scanner and run a full scan, you might have
something sucking up clock cycles.

Running scandisk/defrag also might help if your drive has been getting used
a lot lately. (Start off with a deep scandisk, then run defrag FROM SAFE
MODE, if you run defrag in normal mode on drive C it can cause problems due
to background crap that windows does)

Note: this is all assuming you're running Win98SE; if you have WinME, burn
it; if you have WinXP, I can't help you, and if you're running something
else then I offer you an ass-beating for being a moron, sir.
