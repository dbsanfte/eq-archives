My heated response wasn't based so much on what you said, which
I generally agree with, but how you said it.  I typically don't
like the "mother straightening our her poor, confused daughter"
style of discussion, and that's what I felt coming from you, though
I'm sure you didn't mean it that way.

In hindsight, I was too harsh, and I'm sorry for that.

Yes, I've had to eat those words more than once already...

You're right to take me to task on them.  Hopefully I've sufficiently
taken them back and expressed in more detail how I really feel.  Please
judge me on that instead of the initial spark.

It was only a request, not a command.  Hopefully I'm a little more
cooled down today.  Of course it's you're right in this country to
post to usenet how you see fit (well, within the confines of the law,
anyway!).

I agree that, ultimately, we all have to determine what is and isn't
right and wrong in our own heads.  One person may think diabetes is
a serious genetic problem, and one person might not (like me).  Which
is mainly why I believe the most important thing is freedom of the
individual, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else.

:    I appreciate your trying to make me feel better, but I've pretty much

LOL!

My spelling out your full name was a childish response when I was
feeling heated and threatened: sorry.

How about AMBL-AGE?

Hmmm.  Amblage.  Almost sounds like a real word.
