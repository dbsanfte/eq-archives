Sure buddy, no problem.  If a Guide quit because of this, then they are
no longer there.  If they hadn't quit because of this, they very well
might still be there.  Despite the fact that this is old news, I rather
doubt the Guides who quit in disgust because of this have returned.  Did
you really need that explained??

The entirety of the linked rant.  Guilt by association was the theme of
the day.  If Tweety was a conceited idiot on a power trip and was a
Guide, many assumed that all Guides thought like she did.  Don't you
recall any of this??

You may have been confused by that remark, it was directed towards Biz
in regards to his response to folks calling him names.  As a long time
reader/poster here that should have been clear to you, I was joking with
him regarding the fact that he is not disturbed much by others thinking
poorly of him.  Unless you misread the meaning on purpose??  Please feel
free to let me know whether you are dumber than I thought or you
intentionally misconstrued my words so I may properly consider further
posts from you in light of the answer.  In either case wisdom does not
appear to be your strong suit.

If Tweety is your gf and my post insulted her and so by proxy insulted
you, you have my sympathies but not my apologies.
