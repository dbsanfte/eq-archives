I spent the last several weeks fearing rats in PoJ and I never once
purposefully used the 'exploit'.  Not only that, but I rarely ever saw
anyone using it.  People feared things around in the hallways and up
top and they purposefully avoided the 'exploit' areas because they
were afraid the GMs were watching.
