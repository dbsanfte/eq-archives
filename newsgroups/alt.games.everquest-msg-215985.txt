Harmony only works on mobs up to L40 now, Nature's Harmony (or Harmony
of Nature, or whatever they call it) is single target.  No, Paladin does
not get the AE Pacify, nor do we get the one that works up to L65.  Kaev
has been puller for every LDoN group except his first one (at the end of
that one, a failure, when the Enchanter and Cleric were discussing in
group chat how to have made the pulling go better I piped in with "have
your Paladin Pacify the mobs and pull", it seems that many folks do not
realize that Paladin gets the line, possibly because all they know about
the game is hearsay and/or experience od the L65 raid game).

Well, as I pointed out, I have yet to have Pacify resisted in LDoN.
They resist Stun/Root/Mez/Snare like crazy, but not Pacify.  Better
the Paladin take one for the team on a Pacify resist than the Cleric
or Enchanter.
