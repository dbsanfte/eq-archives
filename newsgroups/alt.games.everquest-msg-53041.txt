Heh... My main isn't of a level where he could take the AC, I think, but I 
could probably pharm the Stein of Moggok until my fingers bleed, and 
eventually come up with the money for the Tboots... I'm just not sure yet I 
like my necro *that* much... :)

Now, if you have done the Jboots once and know you can handle the camp, 
yes, they are certainly an even better present for a baby necro. My point 
was that a stark-bollock-naked Necro (or any caster) with J/T Boots is 
probably more effective at lower levels than mega-twinked but without the 
boots.
