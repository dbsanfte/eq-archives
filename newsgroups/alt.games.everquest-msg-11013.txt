I think that you think that what I'm thinking you're thinking is a bit
overthought...

I was indeed thinking of hotkeys, because I know that they can be assigned
to particular keys on the keyboard. Can /doabilitys be mapped to a
particular key?  I attempted this morning before I left for work,
half-asleep, and the hotkeys were the closest I could manage.

Let me know if I'm wrong, I'd love to be able to configure this so it works
correctly.
