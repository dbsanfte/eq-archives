Bad plan. The thing that keeps the high-end game interesting to me is
that years after PoP came out, elemental and PoTime gear is still
unobtainable except by working to get there.

It gives a sense that there is real reward in doing it, even of others
already have.

That seems fair, though I would not add too many bindable spots.
Perhaps just where the missions are assigned.

Disagree. Monks are supposed to be hard hitters, and IMHO should do
even more damage than they do now, but a monk who gets agro should be
paste.

I'm a necro. I love playing a necro. I disagree strongly. EEs make
playing a necro interesting to me. We're not clerics, but in a pinch
we're important to have around.

SHM and not DRU? That seems strange.

Why?

That makes sense for people who can get that many, but the problem
Verant always cited when this came up in beta was that it was
impossible to tune single-group mobs so that 8 was a challenge, but 3
was doable.

Ah, I love these quests. The game should not be laid open to you like
a map. It's a hard world to get around and some places require
DEDICATION to get in to, and in some cases you can't do it without a
whole lot of friends. This is a good thing, IMHO.

Hrmmm... again, I disagree, but I'd be fine with the idea that you can
"transform" a character. That is, you can delete your main but give
all but the highest-end flags an nodrop gear to another. No epic
transfers. No VP/Time keys (whatever turns out to be the ultimate GoD
flag). But yeah, I could see switching.

If you're playing two characters concurrently, though, I don't see why
you should get your alt bazaar mule Time-flagged just because your
main did it.

Hmmm fine.

What they did right with PoP and LDON was simple: they created an
exapansion that presented a fairly simple progression path that was
easy to physically get to, and that drew in enough players that you
were usually busy doing things.

GoD is actually not very well populated.

Same went for LoY.
