How hard are the Ice Giants? I've killed Frost Giants in GD for a while and
with not too many resists I can solo berserkers there. Even with just my lvl
44 pets.

I would suggest you do get our DoT. It has a low taunt compared to your
other damage spells and seems to be resisted a lot less then normal nukes.

On another note, I usually go for water pets if I hunt in the open. The
extra damage from the nukes does make a difference and with the focus item
the pet has the same hp as an earth one. An extra note on that is, when a
monster starts to flee it doesn't hit your pet anymore. The earth one roots
it so he gets hit more.
