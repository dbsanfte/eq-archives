Got it working!!! Lucky I am.


D3D support was disabled in my Diamond Monster setup.
Now EQ runs with DX8.1, in D3D mode., test and normal servers work.

The colors look more saturated,
the font size of messages and buttons is TOO LARGE, spills over the
screen.

Frame rate is considerably lower with D3D
than it was before with Glide.

D3D is from Microsoft, is'nt it?

BASH BILL GATES!!!! cakes are not enough!
