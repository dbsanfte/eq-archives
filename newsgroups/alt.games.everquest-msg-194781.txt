The cheapest horses are somewhat cheaper than the cheapest lizards (about
8500 plat vs. about 10000 plat.) Only the tan and brown horses are
available at the cheaper price, however - the black/white horses are the
same price as the drogmor.

Whether the lack of a horse head is worth the extra 1500 plat or so is the
player's decision... not a big deal for a cleric IMO but for classes where
targeting MOBs is important (and /assist targeting impractical) the head
can be a big problem.
