Try running a popular EQ site sometime and see how many viruses you
get then :)

None of the ones I've received appear to have been sent maliciously -
they've all been the automated send-to-address-book flavors. But it
seems that a lot of people have me in their address books because of
the Tailoring Guide. Every time a new one of these viruses come out,
it gets sent to me a number of times.
