I am very happy to see all the new changes and such, but am a little
concerned about the implementation of two new features.

   /hitsmode  well it appears that when you setup your hits mode
ME.... your hits show in the window, but not your misses(they are
still in the chat window), so the messages are spread out in two
different windows.  Also the spell damage still shows in the chat
window.
    What Id like to see would be, have All Damage info in one separate
window from the chat window... (i.e. Spell damage, resists, weapon
damage, misses, and damage received and misses)
of course with the options to spread them out between multiple windows
(for those that would prefer the multiple windows... I of course am
not one of them....)

the second issue is with the new chat channels....

In the past I have setup all my macros so that I can go to the chat
interface and change the default chat (i.e. OOC, Guild, Say, Shout)...
now I have to recreate all my macros to do the statement in the
channel I need.  Could there be a way to add another option on the
chat options for making it default just as it is for the examples I
listed.


any comments... anyone else think these just make sense, or am I, yet
again, off my rocker
