They'd have lost sooner.

Nope, once Hitler attacked the Soviets he was doomed, unless Britain
and the US had exited the war at that point.

Supporting the Soviets, even the small support of Lend Lease materiel
and a few RAF pilots, was the key.  Around 80% of the German war effort
was directed at the Eastern Front from the day it opened, to defeat
them all we had to do was give the Soviets enough support that they
could stave off collapse.  We did, and they did.

A relatively unimportant sideshow, they had few men and little of
their best gear there, hardly fodder for extensive losses.

Hitler took some big risks early and was hugely aided by the French
tying their own hands behind their backs and jumping headfirst down
the well (they had more and better tanks than the Germans, but used
them idioticly, the one French general who started massing some armor,
forget his name, was too little too late, the Germans saw what he was
up to and threw everything they had nearby at him before he could get
it together well enough to pose a substantial threat).


US materiel and Soviet manpower were the biggest factors, tho British

stubborness did not hurt at all (they gave Hitler an opportunity to
make his first big mistake, effectively ceding the Battle of Britain
by starting the terror bombing of London which allowed the RAF to
recover).  The Axis simply did not have the population and economic
resources to win the war, things went very badly for the Allies and
still they won handily in 6 years.  You want to speculate about how
things could have been different, it looks a lot more likely to me
that the Axis falls in four years instead of six if you run the sim
over again.
