You are exagerating the requirements to pass the trials here.  They are 
difficult, and, it does require some combination of class/level/equipment.  
Varying one of those changes the requirements for the other two.

I am not disagreeing with the overall point, for most family type guilds, 
the options will be extremely limited as to which particular people you 
need to pass the trials.  There are however a wide variety of group makeups 
that have made it through.  Depending on the class/level/equipment of the 
person that needs flagging, the required group makeup will vary.  To get a 
shaman through, you need extra DPS to makeup for the drop in DPS.  To get a 
high DPS class through, the requirements for the remainder of the group are 
less stringent.  The guild I am in is not equipped with the top 5% 
equipment in the game, not even close.  The toughest mobs that we take down 
are Trak, Va'Dynn, Venril Sathir.  We have a limited amount of SS quest 
armor and Thurgadin quest armor.  With that, so long as the people needing 
to be flagged are high DPS classes, we can successfully complete a trial, 
not every time, but, certainly, we can pass.  To get me (61 shaman) 
through, we did have to call in extra help outside the guild.  We just 
could not generate the DPS required otherwise, at least, not in the 
attempts that we made.
