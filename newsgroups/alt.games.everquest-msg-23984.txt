Last I heard you had to WORK 34 hours/mo (8hrs/wk x 4.33 wks/mo) for a lousy
$9.89 free account.  That works out to a pay of  29 cents per hour.

Still interested?  Ok.

You get to travel around Norrath very quickly.  You get commands that no
mere player has.   You get to hob-nob with the uber guilds and the level 1s
alike.

Sound good?

You also get to be treated like shit, and not respected by 90% of the
membership, including 90% of this newsgroup's readership.   You will be
called stupid regularly and laughed at.

You will have to put up with lots and lots of direct tells from people too
stupid to petition OR by people who think their problem is much more
important than anyone else who was stupid enough to petition.

You will be allowed to answer questions, perhaps to move the many NPCs that
get out of alignment.  You will be like a mushroom when it comes to Verant
Inc...kept in the dark and fed shit (or nothing at all).

Wow, but you ARE "paid" 29 cents/hr for coolio commands.

(I'd be willing to put up with it for 2hrs/wk, but that's not likely to ever
happen)
