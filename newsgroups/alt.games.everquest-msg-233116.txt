I want to fiddle with the new tradeskill UI
changes on the Test server, but my "test" characters
there are all flat broke.

What's the best way to make a few hundred (or 1-2K)
pp on the Test server, given that I can choose any class
and get it to level 25 instantly (along with suitable gear 
and/or spells) using the /testbuff command?

Or, would anyone on Test like to sell me some pp on Test,
bought with pp on the Quellious server where my "real"
characters are?
