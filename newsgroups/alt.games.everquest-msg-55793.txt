    Given the way loot was being ooc'ed, it seemed like it might have been
more productive to just learn the co-ordinate system for the zone you were
in, and run and loot stuff left for others. Of the three items my ENCH got,
two were from someone else's kill that had been ooc'ed. Stinks for XP,
though. But....

    Exactly. Every so often, when someone started the "KSer" rant, I'd /ooc
that fact to the zone. A few people would agree, and the KS whining would
stop cold. I still kept Charm and Mez up, though. 8)
