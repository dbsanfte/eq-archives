About the only thing that really might cause a problem would be that with 
all the digital KVMs I've worked with, there's a few second delay between 
switching to another machine and the display coming up.  Not such a 
problem at lower levels, but that few seconds can easily cost you a party 
wipe as early as the 30s.

Agreed.  I sent back two perfectly fine monitors because they were 
ghosting like a mofo (read: I was seeing upwards of 5 copies of 
everything on the screen) using a "shielded" cable.  Even the Belkin KVM 
cables I have lead to a bit of ghosting, and those definitely weren't 
cheap.  I eventually ended up with some triple coax from a local radio 
shop.  Cost about $50 for the cable, but entirely worth it IMO.

Of course, I'm not running anything through my KVM now, since it'd cost 
another $100 to do it...
