When do -you- know it's time to zone?

I'm not talking about sitting on the tracks and hearing someone
yell "Train!".  I want to know what events trigger that little
voice inside your head that tells you it's time to leave the zone
for a bit.  Or even just sit somewhere out of the way hiding and
watching for a while.

Once, several months ago. I was hunting solo in Black Burrow.
I killing the three snakes in the room with the ramp/ledge.  By this
time I'm quite familiar with the train potential if the zone.  While I
was medding I see this shout, "Has anybody seen my pet?"

Something inside says it's time to leave.  I zone through then
sit and wait.  Not five minutes later it seemed the entire PC contingent
of Black Burrow came zoning out yelling about the largest train
they'd ever seen.
