Yah everyone is MISSING what he is saying. What he is saying is that a
mana using MELEE type will NOT be meditating when its involved in
combat with attack ON against a mob. A caster not casting is NOT in
combat. So really for casters the horse is still nice because you
don't have to /sit to have the same effect as when you sit. At worst
I'd think you might have to stand still.
