30, 35, 40, 45. They are levels where the amount of xp to get through
them scales differently. It takes at least twice as much to get
through those levels as it should. The *REAL* hell is the level
following each one, where the xp penalty on dying is based off the
amount of xp it took to get through the previous level. Which means
you're taking a bigger hit. Even at 31, a death cost me a FULL bubble
of xp.
