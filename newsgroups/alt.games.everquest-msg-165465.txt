Of course he was, and I was being a tad obtuse about it just for the
hell of it.  They left off lots of "not possible" models to save on
video memory requirements, which used to be tons smaller.  Now they've
got so much crap in there that I get the "luclin stutter" seemingly
every time somebody zones into wherever I am, surprised it hasn't
killed any of my toons yet.

But back to Druid fashion, I'm gonna have to get me a Dark Muslin Robe

and a Druid equippable scythe (I think Grimrot drops one), ought to be
worth a chuckle or two to be able to dress up my Human Druid as if he
were a Necro.  Pity you can't do the same for a Half Elf or Wood Elf.
