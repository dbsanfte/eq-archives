Ha! a nice anecdote.
I did the same thing on a smaller level the other day as I was doing a run
to Queynos I stopped and terrorised the mobs there, killing most with one
swipe. It was truly gratifying. I soloed the Klicknic Queen in 3 seconds, I
remember the day when her spawn would send droves of us newbies running in
fear!
I'm greatly looking forward to exploring and stuff too, so far my travels
have only taken me as far as paineel and the warrens.
