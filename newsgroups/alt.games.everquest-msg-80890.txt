I started a kitty bard and gave him a few things I had in the bank:

Singing boots
Syphanic sword
few peice of junk armour
and a sarnark battle shield.

Think this is good enough to level 20? He hits for about 20 points of
damage at level 9 so far which I thought was pretty good, but I've never
playeda warror type past level 10 and not with good items.
