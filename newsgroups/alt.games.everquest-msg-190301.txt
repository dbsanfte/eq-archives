Long ago in a distant land, I, Aku, shapeshifting master of darkness
used to buy lots of HQ pelts and turn them into money-making handmade
backpacks.  Everybody wanted them for wearing and putting in their
bank for the 10 slots.

Now some bastard sells 10 slot bags for 1 pp in the Bazaar.  Cut
them down and sell them for padding if that's what sells and sells
quick.
