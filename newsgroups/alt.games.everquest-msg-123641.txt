Cure Disease is a low level spell, the baseline of the line.  Next up is
Counteract Disease, a spell almost noone bothers to buy, and over
that is Abolish Disease, a shaman only spell.  The various disease spells
require a certain number of cures before they are eliminated, each
time you cure disease you check one cure (and sometimes the disease
will resist that, although that seems to be rare)

I'm not certain how many cures a counteract is worth, but it takes nine or more
cures to eliminate most slow effects, while two counteracts or one abolish
will do the job.  That leads me to think counteract is 5 cures, and abolish
is 10 cures.

Prior to the patch that made the slow spells cureable, cure disease was
an adequate tool, rare was the disease that needed curing in more than
a few casts anyway, and its a hard spell to find.  Turns out the only
place I could find it was on the druid ring vendor in Steamfont, not
something I as a cleric had ever checked into.  The ability to remove
Slow on your tanks is astonishingly powerful though in certain zones,
and I'd think more important now than ever, as with the new AI
a lot more mobs are using the line.

AFAIK the only thing that matters is what actually does the killing blow.
If you want to try dueling to avoid death from a DOT, duel someone who
hits really really hard, or better yet packs a large nuke.  If you are getting
sandpapered away, then when it gets down to the last few points its
a flip of the coin whether the disease gets you or they do (as you suggest
in your example)  On the other hand, if Warmonkey is hitting you for 120 a shot
and exercising a little care, he should be able to guarantee his shot does
the killing... even better would be that wizard, who can take you from
two bubs of health to dead dead dead in one shot.

I've never seen anyone actually do this, however, and can't say there are
no codes in to prevent it.  I'm pretty sure it -is- an exploit, and probably
a bannable offense if you get caught at it.
