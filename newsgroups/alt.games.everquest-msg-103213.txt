well when people include stuff like <mychar> in an example they're usually 
just indicating a field with the <>, to be replaced with whatever.

It sounds like you're including the greater than/less than symbols as 
brackets around your name, when you shouldn't be.

If your wizard is called Gandalf (god forbid), for example:

/target Gandalf
(this should work)

/target <Gandalf>
(this won't work)
