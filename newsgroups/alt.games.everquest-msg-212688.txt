}You get a message that the critter is too high, and you can immediately try

And  to answer your other question, yes, the mob you just tried to DC and 
failed will try to kill you for it. :)  And the question you didn't ask:  
I haven't had a mob resist yet that -wasn't- too high level.  The level 
cap is 46, which at levels 64 and 65 makes not -quite- all of the light 
blue range good targets.
