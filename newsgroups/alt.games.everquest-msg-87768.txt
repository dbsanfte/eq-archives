Just for reference, I have a Pentium II 300 with a Voodoo 3 3000
video card and 192M of RAM.  The trilogy works fine and I have no
intentions of upgrading to Luclin until I buy a new PC.  The 56K
modem connection will work quite well as the game is not
connection speed dependent.  I have DSL with 762K of download
speed and notice only a very small improvement over my old 56K
modem.
