Ya!  Rulez suxxorz!  any rulez.  I mean why can't I drag that bastard on
the cell phone out of his car and crush his skull under my boots?  Why 
can't I say "poopy" and other words so I can get some attention when I
feel the need?  And why can't I download music and software for free
just because the people that own it say I can't?

You talk a good game but are you really ready for anarchy?  You sure? 
Remember, the biggest bastard wins and that just may not be you.
