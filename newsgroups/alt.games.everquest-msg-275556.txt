Although I cancelled my EQ2 subscription right after my free month, I had
purchased 3 months, so still have some time left, and so popped in to try
out /pizza and also see what the new con system is like.

I tried fighting some greens and greys, and noticed something.  In 4 fights
(2 greens, 2 greys), I missed with my hammer *every* *swing*.

I don't recall being that bad at melee.  I do recall that nuking was the
primary way I did damage before, but I thought that I did at least hit on
occasion.

So, am I just misremembering and I really did always suck like this at
melee, or did they nerf something?  Character is a level 13 Druid.
