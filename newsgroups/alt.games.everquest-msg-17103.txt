Hmmmm clearly some people here are not too happy with my post.  As far as I
am concerned I am quite within my rights to be a bit cheesed off when I cant
use a game I payed for cos I cant remember 2 year old account details.  I
have the legit cd and the legit account key, that should be enough to at
least start a new account, its mine, I payed for it, I want to use it, seems
perfectley fair to me.  Clearly the system used is flawed if a legit owner
of the game can get into a situation where he/she cannot use their copy of
the game, at least in my opinion it is.  Also (imho) since I am their
customer and I paid for the game and wish to start paying for the service
its is *most definitely* their responsiblity to enable me to do so, it is
their fault, almost by definition since they are supposed to be providing a
service for me.  Obviously it is not their fault that I cant remember my
account details but it is their fault that there seems no obvious way of
dealing with such an eventuality (such an obvious and totally predictable
eventuallity).  Btw I got a response to my email, quite prompt actually,
they directed me to the 'forgot my station name' and 'forgot my password'
pages which or course I cant use (as I told them in my email).  I will try
phoning them later today to see what can be done.  For those who could see
why I was frustrated and annoyed......thanks.  For those who thought I was
being somewhat hasty and perhaps unreasonable but *still* tried to help
(albeit with a little sarcasm) .........thanks.  For those who could only be
bothered to post insults and sarcasm........ why did you even bother?

Paul.
