I was playing last night in DL, getting some decent experience and 3 times
within 3 hours I was booted back to the desktop with and eqgame.exe has
encountered a problem and will be shut down.  The only other place I have
noticed this happen was The Bazaar.

Ive had no problems with any other zone (that I have visited) I can sit
out there for 4-5 hours with no problem.  Is this type of problem
consistent with what people are describing, weird crashes in sporaic
zones?  If so, damn is it annoying.  I felt so bad for the group I was in
as I kept coming back 3-5 minutes later.  I mean it didnt cause any
deaths, but I can see how it could have.

Does anyone have any suggestions for a fix to this problem?  Deleting
Dreadlands and/or bazaar files in my EQ directory and letting EQ rebuild
them?  Perhaps checking out my datarate.txt file and lowering it a smidge,
could too much data be xferred back and forth causing eqgame.exe to choke
on it?
