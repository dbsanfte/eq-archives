I PLed a cleric with a druid following your same early path, but stayed in
Paludal Caverns until he dinged 22.  The Shik'Nar in the northwest area were
uncamped and very easy pickings, not a soul around.  Went to Netherbian Lair
for 22 and I agree that it sucks.  But then found a great, unused zone!  Go
to Swamp of No Hope near the southern undead ruins and pull everything from
around there.  I think it has a newbie zone exp bonus.  Cleric was 29 in
almost no time at all (power PLers probably would have left a couple levels
earlier, but I was comfortable with the exp rate up to 29).
