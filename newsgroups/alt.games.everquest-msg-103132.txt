I found a site that lists the IP addys for the servers. I'm using
ZoneAlarm. I know how to open it to add the IP's. It gives the IP plus
a range of 11 for each game server. It is also my understanding that
after every patch I must reset this part, no biggie. Now the part I
don't understand. Is it really needed to put in the patcher IP? Is it
needed to put in the login IP? What I'm asking is isn't the game
server enough to get the best performance? The reason I'm asking is
the site lists 2 IP's for the patcher and no IP  for the login server.
