hi lenny, no i dont use dial up-i'm on a high speed cable
connection-but thanks for the try-as an update-uping the voltages for
the cpu and memory really did not work in the long run-i reset every
thing to the mb defaults-and because there have been some hints that
its video drivers or a mb problem-i reinstalled the video drivers-that
got me on, and my character up for a few minutes-but then crash to
destktop-sigh-so today, on the theory that all these crashes might
have corrupted something in windows (XPhome)-i reinstalled( the update
type, not true wipeout and reinstall) windows ex-interesting that
during the loading device section-it stopped and said it needed the
VIAAGPI.SyS from the via agp filter driver disk-sigh-i could not find
that specific driver on the gigabyte disk disk of course-so i forced
it to go without-finished install-did the windows update-windows for
the first few times said it recovered from a serious problem,
regarding drivers :( of course) but it stoped almost crashing after
some of the updates-after that, i went to MB site, downloaded driver
package-intalled it-coincidently the machine called for an ati driver
after the install was finished-so i did find that , installed it all,
fired up eq !! and and-it crashed to desktop just as it finished
loading my specific character-and so this is where i stand :)  i hate
fucking computers, but the problem is, they seem to hate me harder
