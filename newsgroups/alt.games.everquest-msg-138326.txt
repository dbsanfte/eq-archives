They have always been somewhat against that, but maybe for tech
reasons. As it is now having to trust another person to transfer money
probably causes CS problems.

Nope, they are really against world hopping. Plus they charge 50 bucks
for it and people pay it, so whee. Only verant server moves are free
and open to people and those are special case like when a server gets
more crowded. 

World servers are completely seperate, the chat servers are not I
guess. I think the first interserver communication was an accident,
then they went "hey .. feature." On the trib server we started an
/auction chat channel and found that at least one other server was on
the same channel. Other people found that often there was overlap of 3
servers on such channels. 

When they move a character to a new server, it is a manual move. They
have to sort of download from the character server and move it over to
the other server's.  Its somewhat difficult because they did not
originally set it up to make it easy to xfer people (not planning on
doing it ever, probably.)
