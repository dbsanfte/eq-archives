i just put in an nvidia TNT2 M64 (i know , not the best) PCI card, and
now I crash back to the desktop after server screen . I already tried
everything off the eq site, and e-mailed them , but I want to know if
anyone else had this problem and solved it. It was working fine with
my 3dfx voodoo 3 2000, with 16 memory, and now this card with 32
memory , I can't play at all.
