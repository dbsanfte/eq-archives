I saw the same thing against gornit - I've killed him (lets
see - 6min spawn time, <1min kill time, 20+ hours of camping
him) oh 180-200 times.  I know which are the lowest con (max
hit is 88) and which are the highest (max hit 96).  Based on
others comments, this equates to 34th to 38th level.  Also, I
resummoned pets each time 'til I got a 46 hitter (never got
a 48, just bad luck :).  My pet definitely lasted longer against
the 96 hitters with phantom plate than without.

It may be a placebo, but I won't be fighting tough mobs without
armoring my pet anytime soon (solo, in a group it's a non 
issue).
