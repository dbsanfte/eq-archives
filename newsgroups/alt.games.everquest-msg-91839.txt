I agree with most of your post.

I think mostly because I seriously CAN see myself being level 60 in full
crafted. It's sad but might happen. I dont have the best guild so raids dont
happen often and we arent that large or have many high levels yet.

Ah I guess I cant really complain though! I have fun now and then and almost
always enjoy just sitting and talking with people. Whats wrong with that? I
rather be a normal joe then a dude speaker.
