I really hadn't planned on playing on FV today,
but the login server apparently crashed, so off
to Test we go. The newbie zone in Kelethin was
insanely crowded,especially with
non-roleplayers. They were noticeable by their
abuse of the auction channel. This is likely to
be a temporary problem that will be resolved
when the log-in server comes back up.

The hunting grounds were so crowded the mobs
were being swamped after two futile attempts to
kill bats, I switched tactics. (I don't think
anyone was kill-stealing, it's just with six
toons per mob, they mobs were getting swamped as
soon as they spawned by multiple players).

Off I went to the Bards guild. One hour later, I
was flush with 5 pp and an intimate knowledge of
the track between kelethin and felwithe. The exp
that way is slow, but the money is nice at my
level and the road was being kept clear of mobs
by the other players. I only saw five or six
other people doing what I was doing. Are we so
used to pl-ing our characters to get them
quickly through levels 1-5 that we have
forgotten alternative routes to getting exp?

The mail quest is a very simple quest suitable
for very low levels. Once the population of the
server returns to reasonable levels, it will be
a lot less viable, but right now it is probably
the fastest way to get to level 5.
