There isnt a simple answer to that. It depends  a lot on level. I imagine
getting in a group is much easier at high levels or a wizard than at low
levels. In a lot of situations, a wiz is preferable to a necro. In places
where you cat fear kite or use pets, I think most parties would then prefer
a wiz. Wiz's stack and necro dont.
Bards, similarly, are rather tough at the low levels. Once you hit 32 and
the overthere the rest is easy.
I wonder about the long term viability of my 40 bard though. Maybe manasong
2 will be enough to make me popular.
Druids are a well balanced fun class, but at high levels theres so many, and
their abilities are so generic, you will seldom be *needed* on a raid. At
high levels you start to feel a bit nerfed as a druid too.
Overall tho id have to say rogue is a sucky class. maybe ive grouped with
bad rogues, but their so called high damage output has usually been put to
shame by wariors and monks.
