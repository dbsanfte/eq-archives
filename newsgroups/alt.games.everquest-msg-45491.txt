if they did tweak the game engine so GM event chars could be level 90,
shortly thereafter PC chars would follow.  The only reason 60 is the limit
is because Verant's game designers have run out on ideas to what a level 70,
80, and 90 could do that a 60 couldn't, and extend that to all the classes.
Its a exponential amount of content, and a ton of work.

anyone who has 32 K HP is pretty much over 60th though, and many of the 60 +
mobs exhibit powers beyond a normal 60th char.  if anyone thinks that THE
SLEEPER is even close to 60th is way off the mark.

my guess is that just like Verant said EQ would never have new content, and
now is adding lucllin.  I'm thinking that in one form or another levels will
go over 60th.  Believe Luclin is even doing that so after 60th your level
isn't as obvious.

you get to the point where you see high levels fight, it shouldn't be
obvious who will win.  a 60th fighting a 40th is pretty obvious who has a
huge advantage.  that won't be the case 60 + now.  so in retrospect, maybe
the game designers are doing hidden 60 + levels.
