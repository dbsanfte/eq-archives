You should always keep Flash of Light memmed if you are in a group. It has a
shorter casting time, uses less mana and is as good a taunt as a stun. Also,
if the mob is blinded it cant find any casters to beat on :) I use Flash of
Light more than any other spell when grouping , well apart from Yaulp.
