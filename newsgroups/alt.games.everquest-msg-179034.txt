Have you noticed that every single Focus item has an "Exclude: Complete
Healing" on it?

You can have Mana Preservation XI and Spell Haste XVII and Complete Heal
will still cost 400 mana and take ten seconds to cast.

Ya get used to it.  I can cast buffs quickly and using less mana, but my
"class-defining" spell of Complete Heal will never ever get a shorter cast
time or cost less mana.  It's the way of the world.
