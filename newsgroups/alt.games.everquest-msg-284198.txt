One of the easier monster missions (i.e. the pirate ordeal in BBM) has given 
mixed signals in regards to a reward/kill issue.

To refresh a memory or two:  You have 45 minutes to collect AT LEAST 30 
"plundered treasures," mostly accomplished by killing townies in Freeport, 
but usually some are gained by opening chests too.  This is extremely easy 
and it can be accomplished by any half-decent group in far less time than 45 
minutes.

I've heard 2 conflicting opinions.  One, is that extra time is well-spent 
collecting MORE than the required 30 items.  "See how many can be gotten" 
... my record is 76, btw.  The wisdom here is that there's extra xp or a 
better drop at the end.  Two, is that there is no extra exp, the drop 
remains the same.  Thus, may as well soak up the extra time by chilling at 
the dock and trading war stories (or bongs, or beers, etc.)  I think I can 
at least attest to the drop issue ... no difference in quality of the drop. 
It's gonna be a rather lame aug, or boots that 4 classes may use.  XP is a 
little harder to guage.  There've been people in-game who proclaim things 
both ways here.  I hope someone knows for sure.  I do this mission a lot as 
it earns decent xp.
