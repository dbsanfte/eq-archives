Hell levels (all of them) are there due to a quirk in the way that xp
(required) is calculated. If by removing hell levels they mean removing
the changes in xp required multiplier then this would make it easier to
reach 60. It would also mess with allexisting chars current level or xp.
So I can't see them doing that. 

I have posted what I think they should do in a seperate message.
