I have a GeForce card and experience the same thing. Also, it's pretty
evident that they did *something* in LoY that affects gamma. Everything is
noticably darker now, and I actually discovered that my gamma slider does
nothing because I went immediately to try and change it once I logged in to
offset the new gamma look, it was that obvious. Didn't work. GeForce 4,
ti4600 here, with latest nVidia drivers. Although the look is darker,
there's also something about it which is noticably more appealing, too.
Looks gorgeous, although this may just be a result of things being darker
and muting some of the glaring edges, etc. Hard to tell, but the gamma
definitely did go down.

I noticed during the download a file named something like dx8gfx.dll, or
some such. Can't say for sure now, but I remember seeing it go by and
thinking "Hmm, some kind of video update?".
