no, thats about the middle of the road number on Saryrn as well...the 
problem is that with the kiting races quadding, HGs can be incredibly 
hard to come by, even with a low number of players in zone

i don't particularly care for that zone, so i don't go often at all, but 
when there, best rule to think of is that inevitably you will KS 
someone, and someone else will KS you.  unless the other guy is being a 
complete dick about it, it isn't a reason to get worked up.
