    Split screen. On one half is a map of the zone with all PCs, mobs, and
ground spawns as dots on it. You are shown, what direction you are pointing
is shown as a line, and the area visible to you is shown as a shaded circle
around you. On the other half is a listing of every PC, mob, and ground
spawn in zone with the following info: name, level, class, % HPs remaining,
item carried in hand. You can click on any name on the list, and a line will
be drawn from you to the target on the map. The listing is sortable by
various criteria ("namedness", etc.) I've seen ShowEQ on two people's
setups, and it's just amazing to watch.
