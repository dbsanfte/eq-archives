Yeah, but you're forgetting that you can be stingy and get folks killed
because of it, but that doesn't mean it's a bright idea.

How can you tell the difference between the two?  I mean, SOME requests are
obviously stupid, but MOST you won't know unless you grill them for the
reason why they should be blessed with your mana.

What if a cleric refused to start healing you until you were at 30% health,
because as far as THEY know, any enchanter who is regularly hit is a bad
one?  Or doesn't cast the best Symbol spell for much the same reason?  It's
THEIR mana...THEY are in the position of power.  Don't forget that.

You'll come back and say that the cleric is a moron.  Well, yeah, but no
more moronic than YOU when YOU decide what's best for a class (or a very
similar one) that YOU haven't played up to their level.  You saying "yes,
no, no, yes" on what you decide is best for them is suicidal.

You don't know best.  Get that thought out of you're head.  You aren't smart
enough to know what's best for every person out there.  Have you never
played any other class past level 20?  Have you never said to yourself, "oh,
I never knew <this> about that class?"
