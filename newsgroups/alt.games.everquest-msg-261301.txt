Each count of pause is a tenth of a second long, so 110 is an 11 sec 
pause before sitting.

The extra time is there because lag may make the Cheal take a little 
longer than 10 seconds, and because a slight delay after casting might 
help allow the MT to retain aggro when you sit.

The reason the multiple /cast 1 lines are there is to account for 
fizzles, but I think that without putting a pause 2 or so in each that 
you won't recover from your first fizzle before trying a second time.

If you are already casting from the first (or second) /cast 1 line then 
the other(s) will be ignored... not totally, you'll get annoying "you 
can't cast this spell cause you are already casting something you 
doofus" lines.
