Top tanks are now in the 8K range and they're getting new
gear and new levels (more HP) with PoP.  Adding a new,
high-level CHeal doesn't do what they say they want to
do, either, so I doubt that very much.

It's not much of a nerf for clerics, IMO, but it will make
tuning high-end encounters easier since you'll no longer
be able to add damage greater than mob regen, a tank with
sufficient AC and taunt to hold aggro, and enough clerics
and mages to beat any mob.

When this happens, guilds stretching their current limits
are going to get a rude awakening.
