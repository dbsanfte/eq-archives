I can't a Tank would want a Wizard as a partner, exactly how are you going
to keep the tank alive when none of your spells stick on it?
Root and run? great, I can run away just fine on my own.

Wizards calling for meatshields (or even asking for a tank partner) are
likely to be very lonely Wizards.

I wouldn't actually join the Cleric asking for a meatshield or a pet either
but that just goes over peoples heads that I would roleplay a Warrior with
some pride <sigh>
