From the shadows, the mysterious "Lief" <ask.me.for@it.com> (if that
IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>Aye, have 12 AA now, another 33 and my ranger can actually do what his
>description says (ie...DPS :P ).

Well you can start at 36 if you want, your bow damage at AM2 is
(probably) acceptable.

One wonders why you would stop at 59 to do AA though, unless those are
free flag AAs. The slightly faster gross exp gain per kill at 59
rather than 65 is more than offset by the much greater ease in getting
better groups and better hunting spots, along with better attack and
better spells that you have by leveling up first. Besides it only
takes a few days.
