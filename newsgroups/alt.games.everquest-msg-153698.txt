If VI retunes all of the high end zones/encounters to match the
changes to the player/classes, these changes will be a good thing.

Anyone who has played EQ to the higher levels (eq end-game) can see
how badly things are broken. 

"Mud-flation" of gear and abilities over the last 3+ years has really
hurt the game overall. It has created "must have" classes (the holy
trio), and it has made many other classes all but useless or
unstackable in the raiding enviroment. Even worse it has turned many
classes into 1-trick ponies crapping mod-rods, staring at a wall in a
CH heal rotation, or porting/buffing at raid setup only to sit out the
encounter.

The most telling example of the problem is that it is almost
impossible to Role Play on a raid (EQ is a RP game afterall, or rather
it was intended to be). The "tactics" and "skills" used on high end
encounters result in nothing more than a numbers game. Turning the
players into little cogs in a big multi-player machine. It's a little
hard to RP when you are Cleric #2 in the CH rotation. It is even worse
when you cannot even attempt the raid because you don't have enough
Clerics or whatever other class(es) are required for a given encounter
currently logged in.

The massive time commitments required to even play the high-end game
is another example of the problem. 

I am glad these changes are coming. After all this time EQ is due for
some "re-balancing".
