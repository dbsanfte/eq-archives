Game thinks you're still moving.  When kiting I try to run forward away from
my quarry, then as I turn to face it, the server I think gets the idea that
I'm indeed stopped.  When I kite that way I *never* get interrupted.  I used
to get it more backing away from my quarry while trying to keep it in view.
