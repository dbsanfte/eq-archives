   I *had* cash, and announced up front that I hardly had any, but I was 
still willing to pay.

  I'm sorry...did I somehow miss the part of my post where I was holding 
a gun to someone's head? Or did you miss the part where I said "I asked 
in my server's taxi channel for a port"? I sort of got the impression 
that if a druid or wizard sits in the taxi channel and answers a request, 
he or she is already willing to provide the service. 
  I don't know where you get this idea that I think I'm entitled to this 
sort of thing. If no one had answered, then yes, I probably would have 
done the long slog from the NK spires over to WC--or probably just camped 
out and tried later, as my playing time is unfortunately limited these 
days.
