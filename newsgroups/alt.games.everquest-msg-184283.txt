Well, you did get the Emperor's Shield thingie when you had been in the 
guild next to no time, and in the same week you were a bit in the 
doghouse for daring to question the judgement of the guild officers on 
raiding vs. exploring, so it doesn't sound to me like your guild is out 
to fuck you in the ass. Not that you claimed that in so many words. ;)

As for how to deal with not getting enough loot? Very easily... Play a 
soloing Druid. I still woot with joy when a decaying skeleton I whack in 
passing drops a Cracked Staff I can sell for 1.2pp.
