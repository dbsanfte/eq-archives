People act like they've never heard of focus items or what they can do.
Mages have been able to summon several of these for quite a while now.  Are
people just now seeing how useful they are?  I have never been asked to
summon focus items since the spells came out.

I use them all except for the neck, which I switch in when summoning a new
pet.  The increased buff duration, increased DD, faster casting time,
reduced mana usage and reagent reduction are all useful even if you have to
lose INT/WIS to use them.
