How are services such as fire departments, police departments, street 
cleaning, street maintenance, etc. paid for in Britain?  Here in the US, 
the local property taxes are used to pay for a variety of locally provided 
services, including those mentioned, as well as public schools, city parks, 
playgrounds.  Basically any service provided on the local level.  Many such 
services also get monetary support from the county, state, and/or federal 
government, but, are, at least in part, paid for by local taxes, which 
include property taxes.
