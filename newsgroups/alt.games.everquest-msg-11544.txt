I started a ranger - now just a lvl 6 - but i'm questioning its purpose in the
game.  I've read little about the ranger that makes it worth developing.  I
thought it would make a great tank, but seems not to many people agree.  If you
don't mind, please share reasons for and against running a Ranger.   For those
who would simply say pick what you like, I answer, I most certainly will, but
it helps listening the experiences of others in making that decision.

Thanks
