I've visited the site often enough to have it bookmarked.  But much of the
information there is sadly out of date and some is of dubious provenance.  I
don't recall seeing either of these items even rumored, much less confirmed...
but even if I had, I'd have come here for information, because A.G.E. is my
personal EQ community of choice, everything else is just supplement.

I actually know many of the posters here well enough to have some judgment as
to whether they are a) making something up.  b) parroting something they read
c) observing what their personal feeling is about the subject d) went and did
actual tests to see what the facts in the matter are.

For example, one poster says "I have the feeling that if a simple, cheap
upgrade would double or triple the soloing capability of bards, we would have
heard of it" (He has the feeling, and supports it with logic, but admits not
having any facts) while another says "Both are absolutely true. You might want
to visit http://www.EQDiva.com/ where you will find a lot of good information
for bards, including the answer to this question." (Its "absolutely" true...
supported by having read it somewhere, but the source is buried somewhere on
an enormous site and not directly referenced).  Neither appears to have tested
the question for themselves, and they disagree completely; this is fun!

EQDiva posters, I don't know from Adam.

Another reason I post stuff here is because there is a large general audience
here, and we enjoy having discussions about EQ matters; so whenever an EQ
matter comes to mind, I bring it up here in the hopes of sparking a bit of a
chat where some of us can learn from each other and others have the chance to
post gratuitius flames about my misspelling of the word gratuitous.
