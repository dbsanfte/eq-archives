So I had my first experience pulling in PoP (beyond my brief PoD
stint).  After having spent a lot of time in Veksar and Droga I was
fully in my "pulling is evil" mentality, due to my inability to pull
singles in the shops camp in Veksar. Droga was easier due to the aggro
radius, but still not a sure thing.  I loved having our cleric friend
along for the lulling.

Pulling in Halls of Honor was so darned easy it wasn't funny though.  
Harmony...those big wide hall ways...very few wanderers...I can't remember
I had such an easy job.  The only danger was when harmony resisted.  My
buffs were pretty full though, so of course I didn't ask for a charisma
buff and my charisma was at 83. *cough*  

*Hey dude, that butt ugly ranger chyck just tried to offer me some
weed.  How you say we smack her around a while?"

(That's how I think of harmony...getting mobs stoned.)

So, question time...

1) I believe my husband's charisma buff will take me up to at least
120ish.  Will that jump make a difference in aggro acquired on a failed
harmony, or do I really need to be higher than that?

2) Is BoT pulling similar to HoH pulling, in regards to layout? IE, mostly
static spawns with few wanderers that you can easily harmony pull? I am
assuming that even in my very first pickup group I will be there as
puller, becuase that is why people want Rangers in these zones, so I
figure I better be prepared.  And of course, any unsolicited and general
advice about pulling in BoT would be welcome. :)

3) Watching conversations about pulling in this group make me realize that
I can make a big difference based on *what* I pull with.  It sounds like,
with a good warrior, I can do the group a service by pulling with a
high-aggro spell (though not snare...I hate mobs that shuffle on
incoming), becuase when the warrior taunts, it gives him higher aggro.  
Jolt will save *my* butt, but it doesn't help the casters so much.  
However, is this also the case with a pally/sk?  Is their taunt skill
reliable enough, or should I just go back to pulling with jolt, and let
them get aggro using their spells as I would?
