The best rogue I can be would never use poison as often as I could use 
poison even if that increased my usefulness to the group. I'm a rogue 
not a saint.

The amount of time and money farming/tradeskilling to use poison(s) on 
every mob in a good group would probably make a peridot screwed cleric 
feel humbled.

Poisons are more like Shaman Alchmeny than Hybrid spells. Potions are 
useful, very useful even, but you don't go drinking them between every 
pull... its simply not cost effective.

mmmmmmm farming... as a rogue. (Time to roll up a necro or bard alt... 
they're much better farmers)
