Ack! No! The clarity yes, but not immediate haste. It doesn't last long
enough and costs too much to be throwing it around without purpose. I
don't start tossing haste on the tanks until someone goes out to pull.
Clarity isn't exactly light on the mana either. When I join I drop crack
on all the casters, then sit my ass down to med for the first pull. When
that mob is coming in is when the tank can expect his hit o' speed, and
they won't all get it right away either. The main tank always. The others?
Maybe - depends entirely upon their class and the situation. Anyone other
than main tank is going to get it as conditions warrant - and I'm not
being stingy or stupid, aggro management for the entire group is my job.
If the main tank is hasted and the other melees are not, it's easier for
the main to hold the aggro, even with a monk and a rogue ripping away at
the mob like madmen.  I try to pace casting so that someone always has
haste - they may just not all have it at once.

Rogues though - well, there's nothing quite like watching the little buzz
saws go to work. Their haste icon shall never dim if I'm around ;-)

Cast on yourself first, then wait one minute, then hit everyone. When you
see your icon blinking you'll be hitting them with their refreshes before
theirs start to blink. Makes them all think you're a god or something
;-) I don't know how many times I've landed crack on someone -just- as
they say /g crack going.
