I have an Erudite Necro worshipping CT.  I have found that I am
tolerated in E/W FP, as you say.  However I am hated most other
places.  Here's the good thing though.  My faction seems to be on the
redline in most places.  I can fix it fairly easily if I need to.  One
nice thing was that my faction at the OT outpost was merely
apprehensive.  (I took it to amiable pretty quick to get my hammer) 
Also, IIRC, Neriak was not KOS either.

Seems to me that you will trade off a few factions if you choose DE or
Erudite.  But the advantage of the Erudite is that none of them are
deep KOS.
