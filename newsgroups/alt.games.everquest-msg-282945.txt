eh, i blew $60 on the game.
had some RL friends who were all going to play together.
well, turns out one of my friends processor isnt supported by the game. 
  at the moment i dont recall the problem, but his system isnt terribly old.

so while waiting for him, me and another friend played it a bit.  its 
all group based, all dungeon based.  its got some stuff i like.  the 
reserved loot system is a nice touch.  no ninja looting now, and some 
nice rewards for doing easy stuff at a lower level.

but ive played it a total of 3 times, completed like 5 quests, and im 
already bored of it.  theres no solo content, so have a group ready, or 
run the risk of sitting and waiting.....exactly what drove me from EQ.
