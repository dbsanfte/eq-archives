Since the release of Shadows of Luclin, Everquest has become unplayable for
many.

WE would like to have our accounts credited for the time we have been unable
to play. WE would like to be able to get refunds for the upgrade that is
worse than most beta software.

Until such time as that happens, We will not purchase any SONY product.

Once happy EQ'ers


Sincerely,
