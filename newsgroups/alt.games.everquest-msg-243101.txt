i cancelled one of my accounts today

(i CAN have my own stuff!)

not being able to multibox since the dx9 patch has frustrated me to no end

the laments of the previously spoiled:

my 56 monk is less fun without my 58 shaman, my 52 war will never fight vox
with my 52 cleric, my 65 ranger will not *destroy* things with my 65 rogue,
my 65 enc misses pocket snare and ports from my 65 wiz

and i can't powerlevel!  =(

booo =)

hoo =)

hoo =)

down to 1 account

back to having to go LFG, since i'm not my own group

back to being unable to powerlevel my friends' and my toons

back to being a regular "high-bie" ... just like everyone else

in xp groups, i only get 1 roll!

on raids, i can only see what my character sees, not the whole friggin'
thing

and worst of all, i have no straightman for my /shout banter--

"you've got a beat like a cop!" and "randy newman was right, down with short
people!" ...these things can't just stand alone! no setup! phooey

/sigh

multiboxing was the best thing about eq...not because i played solo, but
because i was proud of efficiency

and i really hate LFG -- i can still form groups, but i can't load up a
class to fill a niche spot... i have to sit on my hands and wait for one to
show up


oh well

ps - hey, anyone want to buy me a computer? ^_^
