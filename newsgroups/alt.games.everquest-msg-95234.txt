You certainly get high points for being very amusing.

the /afk command was put in the game so that you could show other people
(or respond to /tells automatically) indicating that you were
temporarily not at your keyboard, and not just ignoring them. Period.
End of discussion. The "afk" tag does *NOT* grant you any special
rights, priveledges, protection, etc.

Should people *intentionally* train somebody who is afk? Obviously not.
They shouldn't train people who are at the keyboard and medding either.
But sometimes, for any one of more reasons than could be listed, people
will be running around with mobs on their ass and run over/near you.
Maybe they didn't see you because of zone lag. Maybe they were running
backwards kiting. Maybe they were frantically typing out a /shout
TRAIN!! message and just didn't notice you. Who's fault is it if you die
while afk in a potentially dangerous area? (say it with me)........
"Y_O_U_R_S".

"Tread carefully" around afk people while I'm hunting? Not bloody
likely. I'll do what I can to be polite and sociable and not
intentionally cause you grief, but I'm not taking on the role of your
designated babysitter because it's "too much trouble" for you to log out
and back in and summon a new pet. Let's see how much trouble it is to do
all that *after* you go find your corpse, loot it, get a rez, and med up
from the rez effects. Gee, maybe you should have logged off before going
on your wife's errand to the store after all.
