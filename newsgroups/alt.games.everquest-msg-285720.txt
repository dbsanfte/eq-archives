I have to say the one thing that has disappointed me about Vanguard are the 
bugs. There are lots of them. None of them are show stoppers, but when 
Sigil's CEO says this is a matter of course for MMORPG's I could retort 
'What about Warcraft?'.

Warcraft came out with extremely few bugs - I personally didn't notice any 
on day 1. Most of their initial patches were game-play tweaks rather than 
bug fixes. It was the initial polish of WoW that I think hooked people.

Vanguard has me hooked because it is unique, but I wonder how many people 
have turned away from it because they cannot see through the bugs? Releasing 
games early is in my book a poor excuse.
