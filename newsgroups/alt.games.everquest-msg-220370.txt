And if there aren't homes for the offspring of papered animals?  It's a
ludicrous distinction.  The *very* few people that actually make use of a
dog's papers would *never* consider having their pets "fixed".

All the rest of the animals are mutts, whether they have papers or not. 
There was a side discussion about where you draw the lines in this thread. 
Why does this line matter?  Do your pets suck because they don't have
papers?  Please, put them out of their misery and make up for the idiot that
didn't get his pet fixed before it had yours.  :P
