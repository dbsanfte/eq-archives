ouch i wish i had 10 pp :(

most of my money seems to be going on buying food and water. i'll search a
few sites for the location of these items. i think my current staff is just
a normal one. hopefully i will get alot more pp from my hunting in BB. i
havent gone inside the burrows yet, i am still battling in the
outer/waterfall area, waiting for respawns, maybe i'll stick to Qeynos
hills.
