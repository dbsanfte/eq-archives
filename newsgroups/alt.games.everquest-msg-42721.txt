Hmm, Misty thicket is a newbie zone, should be an exp bonus there,
shouldn't there?

I'm already KOS in high pass, don't really want to kill orcs, they
are sort of on my team, you know, but I always invis up to pass
thru here anyway.  With the exception of port cities (where I may have
to linger on the docks for a while) and cities with see invis guards,
I really don't give a hang about offending the good guys.  Like it,
in fact!

Pity, this is a great faction to be bad at... Halas isn't in the way to
anything,
and its a simple matter to avoid the one see invis guy out in everfrost,
Brandl.

Ah yes, I'd forgotten people do hunt there.  OOT is a pain to get to,
but since I can bind in the zone it won't be bad once I'm there.  Have
to post a mule there to buy and sell for me, but that's not a big deal
either.

Anyone else know anything about Gnomehunting?

Hope killing in high pass doesn't hurt my freeport faction, that would
be a drawback.  Not enough of a one to stop me doing it, of course,
especially with the Freeport tunnel system in place.

Wheee, lowered faction with those smarmy woody two shoes!  Forgot
to say I'll gleefully be going on POG raids someday, which is another
whole zone of hunting my "good" characters have morally insisted
on staying away from.
