I don't know if anybody has read the naming policy or not
(http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_naming_policy.jsp)
but I fail to see how any of these surnames, even when combined with
the first name 'Solare' would produce a violtation of the naming
policy.

Names are not allowed if they are:

- "Vile, profane, rude, or racist@
- "of religious, occult, or significant historic origin"
- "Trademarked names of products, services, or concepts"
- "Non-fantasy oriented names from popular media"
- "phrases that would not be found in the place and time setting of
the game"
- "Proper names from EverQuest"
- "chosen with the intent or possessed with the effect of harming the
reputation of or used to impersonate a Customer or representative of
Sony Online Entertainment"
- "Names containing titles within them"
- "Fantasy-oriented names that are easily recognized from popular
existing media"

As you can see, phrases are not prohibted unless they break one of the
above rules.  Personally I fail to see how any of the following are
against policy:

Solare Eclipse
Solare Starfire
Solare Storms
Solare Storm
Solare Wildfire

yes they are phrases, but they break non of the above rules.  If you
would rather have one of these names to the one you eventually ended
up with, then I suggest you re-petition.  If the guide answering the
petition refuses to change your name then tell them you want to talk
to a Customer Service Represenative about it.  The guides are just
volunteer players, afterall - they don't, necessarily, know policy as
well as the CSRs do.  The CSRs are SOE employees and knowing and
applying policy is their full-time occupation.
