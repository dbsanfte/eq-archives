Interesting idea, and even more interesting opinions.  So I shall try and do
justice in sharing mine.

1) If you are a first time EQ player and start with higher level character,
you won't have the same concept of dieing like you would when you were level
10 and lost all your gear.  Or better yet, maybe you would and be hoppin mad
when you can't find it.  In either case, these characters will likely be
more cavalier in their approach and that changes the face of the game quite
a bit.

2) You are likely, as a new player, to go backwards in exp. more often than
forward for a time being.  I can just see the small fortune a 96% res'ing
cleric and a corpse locating character can earn.

I have a few mid-level characters and was at a friends house.  He logged on
his 60 warrior and let me play him some.  Playing a warrior is not as
complicated (not to slight warriors) as playing say an enchanter with 6 mobs
breathing down the groups neck and one petted (no I don't have a chanter).
However, even playing a warrior is far different at 60 than it is for my lvl
26.  It would not take a group long to figure out who the "off the shelf"
warrior was, and boot him out of the group.

I don't like the idea of store bought toons, nor do I think it will happen,
but if it does I don't think they will cause current high end characters
much trouble since they will be black balled during the first botched raid.
