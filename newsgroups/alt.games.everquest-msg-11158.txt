Having been born into Catholicism, I'm in full agreement. I was
confirmed at the age of 14 or so - the theory is that they wait for
confirmation until a child is old enough to decide for themselves, but
I kind of doubt that most kids who go through with it are doing it
because they want to - I went through it because my parents wanted me
to and it never occurred to me to tell them "no".

Hey, and while I'm on the subject of children being made to do things
before they're old enough to understand them, I object to making kids
recite the Pledge of Allegiance, both on religious grounds ('one
nation under God') and a different moral concern ('I pledge
allegiance'). What the hell does a first grader know about pledging
allegiance to their country? 

We now return to our regularly scheduled religious discussion.
