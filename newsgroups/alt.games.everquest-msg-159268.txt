Player Auctions has my contempt on general principle. My Super Sales,
I loathe because the asshole running the piece of shit site has to go
and spam every fucking guild message board he can find with tripe
about how great his site is (which, honestly, it sucks ass anyway.
Nevermind that he's ripped off other people's art to decorate the
site, too... But, hell, just having the site tells you he doesn't give
a rat's ass about copyright...)
