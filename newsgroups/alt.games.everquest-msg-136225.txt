Welcome to EQ!!! Getting to level 10 your first week playing is doing
great!

Join a group of players near your level. You can type into the chat
buffer " /OOC Level10 Ranger looking for group" without the quotes.
(/ooc means out of character)

That is how the game is played from level 1-60. You are doing fine.

Were they using a 2-Hand Slashing weapon (higher damage, but longer
delay between swings)? Were they "twinked" (using awesome  weapons
that are intended for characters much higher in level)? 

>I am whacking away for 13 and a kick for 8. 

That is normal damage for a level 10. Your damage output will go up as
you level, and get better gear.

You are doing fine. You are not missing anything. Relax and enjoy the
game. Levels and gear all come over time. It takes a long time to
advance in EQ. Enjoy the journey, make some friends, and don't worry
about how fast you are levelling or getting gear.
