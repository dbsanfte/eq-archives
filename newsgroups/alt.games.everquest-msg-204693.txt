I have trained swimming in two places. Ak'anon, the Gnome City and The 
Docks in Butcherblock near Kaladim, the Dwarvan City. Never had any 
mishaps ever happen at either spot. Next time you in to either spot max 
swimming out.

PS- Also, I recently trained 5 points in the pool in Shadow Havan. But 
being a Gnome I had a hell of a time getting out of the pool!
