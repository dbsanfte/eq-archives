My current obsession is completing the quests so I am hanging around
Lesser Fay.  I am waiting for the Necro and Courier to pop and hunting
Ghasts for their hearts.  A couple of questions:

1. I have been hanging around the obelisks killing PH after PH and
have yet to see the necro.  Is there some way to force him up?  I did
get a Ghoul Boss in one rotation who conned red at 30 and killed him.


2. On track and all around me are millions of Fae Drake type mobs.  I
was thinking of killing these when I see them to get some Ghasts in
the wandering mix.  I have only seen 4 ghasts so far and gotten one
heart out of it.  My only concern is the Sky Talon faction hit I took
when killing a Fae Drake.  Will this faction ever be an issue for a
Wood Elf Druid?   I am not a big fan of burning faction with friendly
races/classes just to score.

Also if you are ever in Lesser Fay watch out for the Pissed off
Equestrian or something similarly named.  It nailed me for 500 damage
before I was even aware it was near me.  I escaped but barely.


Any advice would be appreciated.
