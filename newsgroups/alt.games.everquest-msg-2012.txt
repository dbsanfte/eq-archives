Correct. It is just considered incredibly impolite to call the "play 
nice" policy on people. They will try to let as many people know that you 
did that, and will (rightfully IMO) try to ruin your reputation.
There may be more things they can do within legal limits. If you are 
sitting next to them, they can keep pulling, through your party, and it 
will not be considered training you. And you know, sometimes bad pulls 
happen.
Another example was when some group wanted to "share" our room in Kedge 
because they couldn't keep any other rooms by themselves, we ended up 
buffing the hell out of our resists and killing a few shimmering 
sailfins. They rezzed the losses and left.
Let me draw an analogy. It is not illegal to use adult language 
extensively in this board. It's not illegal to flame people for no 
reason. Yet doing so will make more people KF you, and less people take 
any of your words seriously

Yes. Usually if I want in there really bad, I ask people how long they 
are gonna be there. In most cases they agree to send me (or my alt) a 
tell when they leave.

Well, it's still better to settle things peacefully. In some cases they 
don't camp *all* the mobs in the area, or they don't keep up. If every 
single mob is killed in the entire zone, then it may not be a good zone 
to hunt in.

I agree, but I'd rather leave this choice to them. When I feel like it, I 
go to a less camped spot myself rather than forcing others out
