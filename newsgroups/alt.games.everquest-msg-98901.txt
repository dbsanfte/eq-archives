Hotkeys my good man.  Only have to hit a key once every 3 seconds to stop the 
current song and start the next one.  It's trying to carry on chats with 3 or 4 
people simultaneously WHILE twisting that gets tough.  Also, with a good chair 
and good posture, typing is very unlikely to cause me any pain.  Mousing on the 
other hand seems impossible to do without some odd or unbalanced positions.
