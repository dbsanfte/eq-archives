Hey everyone -

I first played everquest about the time it was released.. I got a magician
to level 50 and a rogue somewhere in the early 40's. I quit playing RIGHT
before the Plane of Fear opened. I had just spent 72 hours camping Drelzna
for J boots, and was so disgusted with my addiction that I vowed never to
play again...

    Well I was browsing amazon today, and just broke down and pre-ordered
Everquest: Gold... Since I have never even seen an expnasion pack, gietting
4 at once seems like it would bring back that amazing feeling when
everything was still fresh and new. This time I have promised myself to play
in moderation, and play for fun. My questions to you guys is, how much has
the game changed since the early days? Are there any good webpages I can
visit to get a quick refresher course?

    The biggest problem i've been having that has been driving me crazy, is
what damn class to play!

    Enchanter - When I was level 35+ I was always fascinated with the
enchanter. They always had so much to do in battle, and every group craved
one. But, is this class fun to play BEFORE level 30? I may never get that
high this time, and he cant run fast....

    Druid - This class seems like it will be the best choice.. Easy to
play.. lots of stuff to do, very self-sufficient..I can heal.. buff,
teleport, and run fast. Downsides, its not an 'essential' group character,
due to being a little to jack-of-all-trades.

    Cleric - I love helping people.. I love healing people. I love
grouping... but the cleric means, i need to get weapons and armor, and I
cant run fast....

    Bard - very cool group tricks. and can run fast.. a little too group
dependant, and i cant help people who arnt in my group like i can with
druid/cleric.

I have no interest in soloing, I want to be a group character, but I also
dont want to die extremely easily when exploring the world (thats why
running fast / invis is so important to me :P ). Also on this note, should I
try to join a guild immiadtely so I can get into regular groups, or is it
not worth looking at until i get to a reasonable level.
    Anyway, just posting to make sure my assumptions about the classes still
hold true after 4 expansion packs, and wondering if anyone has any other
suggestions.

    Thanks!

-ilian
