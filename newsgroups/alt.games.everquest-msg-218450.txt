If you love to solo and are a machosist, you have picked the right
class. You may want to reconsider your choice though, both Magician and
Necro are much better solo classes. Once you hit 30 your will start to 
get too many annoying tells asking you if you need a group.

An enchanter can root rot just fine, root will break occasionally, but
your biggest problem will be, 1) It will take forever to kill any mob
you can get exp off of with choke alone, 2) after the mob has sat for
awhile choking away, it gets really pissed at you and your feeble pet
will not be able to taunt it off of you and it will be a race to see if
your pet can kill the mob before it kills you. This is a race you will
loose regularly starting in your 20's.

As I understand it, the animation steals almost no exp if you do any
damage at all.
