All I need to make me happy would be a full set of Affliction III,
Enhancement III, and Healing III items.  There are a few of them that are
not overly needed, like decreasing cast time on enhancements, or increasing
range on enhancements.

So far I have my GEBs, oooo, my buffs cast faster.  I have several
Affliction II items on various twinks that are going to have to give them up
for a while I think.
