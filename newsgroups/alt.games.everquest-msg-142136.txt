Why not?  Like I said, druids are called by their gods to protect
nature, while clerics and shaman are called to protect their people.
Protecting nature doesn't mean you have to heal people.  Hell, one
could argue that protecting nature is more about hurting people most
of the time.

As it is right now, things are tilted that way.  Off the top of my
head, druids tend to have more and better offensive spells than
shaman, and shaman have better buff/heal type spells.
