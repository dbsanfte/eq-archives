At that level I usually use East Karana to Power Level a character with my
Druid. Succor East takes you right in, lots of animals to kill ( love the
pelt and spider silk drops there). But any place you can find a selection of
High Blue, white, and yellow mobs is great. Most will tell you to use
Paludal Caverns for it's high Zem, but that place can be a zoo, and you want
a steady stream of Mobs. Plus with the Druid you have easy in easy out to
bank or log.

Have the Druid Sow and buff you with his highest Skin Like..., Regen and
Damage Shield. You pull with your best DD spell and melee. The Damage Shield
will do most of the damage. When the mob runs root it and melee again, or
finish it off with your nuke. The druid should also snare the mob and heal
you when needed.

The levels will fly by, your defence will be maxed (good) but your spell
skills will lag so every few levels take the time to stand and cast low
level spells of each type to move them up. I would do Minor shielding
(Abj.), True North (Div.), Fade (Alt.), and Eye of Zomm (Con.) over and over
until they max for your level. Evocation should stay up using your nukes to
pull, if not find a newbie area and  cast Shock of Frost  on greens or mob
corpses, (Can you still cast DD's on corpses for skillups?)

Also remember if this is your first time playing the character, and you do
plan on grouping with him, to take some time to join groups and learn your
characters function in a group every few levels also. If you plan on soloing
all the time, this is not as important.

Good luck and happy PLing,
Naphtoe
