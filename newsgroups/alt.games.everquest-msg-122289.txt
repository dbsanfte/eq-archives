To reiterate the rules on item transfer:

1) Use someone you *know* and trust.

2) Have someone you *know* and trust create a mule to help you do the
transfer (if they're not in the zone themselves).

3) If you're picking someone at random, then:
A) NEVER pick someone who's Anonymous.
B) ALWAYS pick someone who's in a guild you recognize (he's got more
to lose by screwing you over).
C) TRY to get a guild officer (who's got even more to lose).
D) TRY to get a known high-skill tradesman.  (Why?  Because for a
tradesman reputation is absolutely everything.)

My main character on Xegony is a guild officer and a Grandmaster
Smith.  There is literally NOTHING in the game that you could ask me
to hold for you that I would be tempted to steal.
