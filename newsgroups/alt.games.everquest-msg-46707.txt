No, but they can end each fight full health and full mana,
so that they can -constantly- be killing.  This has become
a nuisance to me, since I started my necro in order to
solo, with brief periods of activity followed by meditation
breaks where I can do some of the housework et al
that I tend to ignore for EQ... only after hitting about
level 16, there is no rest needed, in fact sitting down
hurts, after 20, since Leach wears out long before Allure
does.

If I can find a feed of high yellows, then I can engineer
some meditation time, but even that is short.

Now a Druid, on the other hand, will kill 4 mobs and
then have to sit to med back most of their full bar of
mana, with nothing (until high levels) to boost their meditation
rate.  Yes, thats 4 mobs killed in the time that a necro might
kill two... but the necro can probably kill 6 in the time a
druid can kill 4 -and- med back to full.

You also don't see druids quad kiting indoors much, while
a necro is almost as powerful indoors as out, given a "safe"
position to fight in, can FD pull singles out of spawns and
use self and pet to tank the mobs down.  In this case there
is some medding needed, as the pet needs to be healed up,
nothing is as efficient as Fear Kiting... but necro's kill rate
is cut in half while a druids kill rate is cut to a fourth... or
eliminated entirely.

Static spawn on a six minute timer?  Don't make me shudder.  -Constant-
feed of mobs, no waiting, since there's no need to med or heal up in
between fights.  A six minute static spawn would mean killing 1/6th the
mobs per hour that I'm capable of.  On the other hand, it -would- help
me get the dishes done!
