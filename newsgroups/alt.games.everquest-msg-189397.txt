Mage pets are tougher and more versitile. Overall, mages are less
dependant on buying supplies, etc than a necro and have fewer faction
issues. Necromancers, however, have the advantage of being able to
fear-kite, stacks of DoTs, Feign Death, and life->mana spells combined
with life leeching. For a mage, the pet is his main tank. For a
necromancer, it becomes more of a persistant DoT to beat on the back
of the fleeing mob and an emergency tank.
