Wow you have some odd ideas about raiding.  These days, anything with 
the DPS you describe above certainly doesn't exist in the way you 
describe it, because virtually every raid since GoD onwards has 
something else killing your DPS like AE's, trash, traps etc.

I can't think of any single raid team in the game that fields 20 
clerics, not even during PoP and the days of 72 and sometimes 120 person 
raids did raid teams have to field 20 clerics.
