While I am not a troll, my SK was able to sell to the merchant in the
Windmill in LOIO.  I was indifferent to him.  He doesn't have much in the
way of supplies so stock up before you go (food, water etc).  My SK is an
Erudite so that may be why I am indiff. You can check him out, just /con him
and the Professor before entering the Windmill.
