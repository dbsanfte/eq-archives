With this setup - you will proberly be more efficient for quite a long while
as a duo, and not joining a full group. The benfits of being able to
communicate directly with you partner is immense and once you get used to
it, is hard to do without.

If you want to practice grouping skills though - a good idea is to
physically seperate your computers and maintain RL silence for sessions on a
regular basis.

This will improve you ability to communicate in game - and will make you
more aware of the challenges and limitations of playing alongside people you
can't communicate directly with.

Cheers
