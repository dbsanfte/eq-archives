Yes, those are the new kitty type models. One other guy in the video
is the ratman model. In general, I don't like any of the models. They
are all pretty horrible. They end up looking like poser models or
something, very sterile. Evidently being able to have more polygons
and detailed textures makes the models a billion times worse than the
old EQ models, which actually have charm. They seem more like
placeholder engine testing quick models to me, but that probably is
not the case. If I was in charge, at SOE, I'd say "hey that is kind of
neat but can you bring me it again when you get the REAL models done?"

Word of warcraft shows how that doesn't HAVE to be the case,
in that they manage detailed models with kind of a cartoon quality
which fits quite well and lets them still have charm.
