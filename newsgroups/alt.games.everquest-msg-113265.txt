Why would you call it "pestering"? Pretty arrogant term imo. Aggemammon
asked
politely. Beeing ignored or rejected is fine, I just agree that there is a
pattern compared
to the shammies.

It might be because of the newbies not asking shammies as often as druids,
rendering the
shammies less "tired" of sowing than the druids, or it might be that
druidplayers are just
not as "Tunare" like as their class bids them.

In my opinion, going anon cause you are tired of answering peoples requests
for SoW is just
as arrogant as ignoring. Anyone who has played the game even slightly can
spot a druid anytime
anyway.
