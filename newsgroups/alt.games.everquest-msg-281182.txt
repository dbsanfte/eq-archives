Okay, I left EQII a month ago and i'm feeling the urge to go back. I left 
for two reasons- firstly, I had a growing feeling that my money should be 
spent better elsewhere; and secondly that I was getting rather bored. Due to 
working and the occasional interruptance of my social life, I didn't spend 
enough time online, and felt my guildmates were getting waaay ahead of me. 
My main was L28, and had only gained a couple of levels in the space of a 
month. I spent an awful lot of time trying to complete menial, 
half-forgotten quests to gain rather insubstantial XP, and the whole 
tradeskill process got really irritating really quickly.

So... why the hell do I want to go back, I ask myself? I feel like leaving 
Norrath was the worst thing I could have done, that I didn't persevere 
enough or see enough of the great things I could do, that I was the one 
making it less fun for myself. Hell, it feels like a damn relationship! My 
plan had been to start afresh, to abandon the idea of joining a guild as I 
haven't enough time to make a meaningful contribution, and to try a more 
solo-friendly class (I was a Templar- my main reason for existence was to 
heal others, and a templar that can only group occasionally just doesn't 
make sense to me).

Anyway, I can't decide. I have heard relatively little about the new update 
(DoF), but i'm tempted to come back to try it out. I'd appreciate some help 
with my dilemma.

Thanks,

Martin
