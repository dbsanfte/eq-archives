DE troll? not at all really...

but if you're playing your SK to bash and slash, you will be nothing but a
weak warrior

the spells after 30 are more mana intensive and you "will" need the higher
int to live through the mob

darken, pet, fear, dot, attack, dd (if preferred), repeat....... then tap

with the higher int I can solo well while only taking on a minimal amount of
damage

now a DE troll would be "all you are is another dumbfuck warrior who wanted
a mana bar and a pet"  :P

I "am" working up an ogre SK because my wife wanted to start new characters
and we thought a SK/Shammy combo would be fun
