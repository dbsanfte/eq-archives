Ugh... that's disapointing. It should be been done differently. I like
*secret recipes* that have to be discovered. But a character flag per
secret recipe... really... how many flags do you really think they are
going to allocate?

I'd rather have seen a recipe book, where you collect the recipes like
spells. Then they could do cool stuff like bundling 'recipe-spells'
into packages... so you can put 'Binly Recipes volume 1' into your
book and have access to all the recipes therein... 

That would greatly allow them to reduce the number of flags... you'd
only need one for every package, not every recipe...

Oh well... maybe EQ2...or WoW...
