Just my two cents worth on the subject.

Human necros will level the fastest they have the lowest exp penelty.
Gnome necros are tolerated in more cites easier for them to bank just about
anywhere.
Erudite necros have the highest INT for the biggest starting mana pull and
the best for below level 50 playing
Iksar necros (which I have) have regeneration which works great with Lich
type of spells and is the best for post level 50 playing but are the slowest
leveling of all necros.

At low levels when I cast Death Pact I could meditate and not lose any
health while other races would have to watch health carefully.  At level 34
with Call of Bones I noticed my health would go down while meditating but it
wasn't very fast and by my mid 40s it was even again. Now Lich at level 49
is awesome 20 mana boost and 32 health loss per tick is what I still use at
level 55. I have to watch my health now but if I have a shammy nearby to
cast Regrowth then I'm set. This spell also exceeds the best Enchanter's
clarity spell, Koadic's Endless Intellect which gives you 14 mana per tick
and +25 to INT and WIS. I still have 2 Lich upgrades to go, as long as I
keep my health up I will always have mana to pump to clerics and chanters on
raids.

Necros can solo yellows till about low 40's but you have to be very
carefull, everything depends on casting darkness on the mob and not have it
resisted. If your darkness does stick then you can start fearing DOT's and
send in pet and if some of the spell get resisted now, you will have time to
recast them. If your first darkness on a MOB does get resisted you can try
again although I don't recommended, becasue the last thing you want is to be
hit and stunned by a yellow when trying to cast FD or gate.
