Well, quad boxing as an example sure does skew the believability but I would
be surprised that with 500,000 accounts that's any more than 400,000 people.
I have 3 accounts, my best friend has 3, my brother has 2, my other best
friends (a couple) have a total of 3.  My guild has 80 active players
(people) with a median level of 60 and average of 58 and I'd venture to
guess that those 80 people easily have more than 100 accounts and it
wouldn't surprise me at all to find we have 120.

I have no idea the demographics of the game, when it comes to levels, age of
accounts, etc., so I don't think I'll speculate further.  I have little
doubt that the chances of a level 40 with multiple characters having more
than one account are pretty good.
