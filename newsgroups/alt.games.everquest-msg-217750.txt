i think he just found out the easy way

this right here is the easiest thing there is; there is ALWAYS someone
trying to kill phinny

get a ranger mule or ask a friend -- catch phinny up, send tells to all
sorts of people, tattling on the existance of mr. fishizard

or, supposing he's not up...grab invis pots and just try to head in =)

i might sound like a jackass .... but you don't care about phinny, right? ju
st the spell?

don't organize a raid, just tell all the 51-60 wizard that belong to
respectable guilds, and let them organize themselves

that should do it......BTW you can also find a druid who needs tainted ->
corrupted seahore for their epic and try the same plan

they added tunnels and such to the zone, making it a little more complicated

and it's REALLY hard to explain with words, so get an up-to-date map =)

good luck indeed
