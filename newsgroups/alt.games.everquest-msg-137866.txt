my naked h00man warrior bazaar dude made me 30k+ in the first like 2 days of
using the bazaar.  I was absolutely stunned, as i'd sold no "uber" item,
nothing even remotely decent.. 1 item for 8k, the rest was just junk tho
(and marked ridiculously cheap in most cases)

of course in the near week since then, I've made maybe 2k :(
Im going to change it slightly though.. the 30 item limit is being a pain, I
come back from work to a ton of tells "
I CANT SEE UR ITEM XXXXX AND I WANT IT!!"
"I CANT SEE UR ITEM XXXXX AND I WANT IT!!"
"I CANT SEE UR ITEM XXXXX AND I WANT IT!!"
"I CANT SEE UR ITEM XXXXX AND I WANT IT!!"
"I CANT SEE UR ITEM XXXXX AND I WANT IT!!"

So im going to make a mule on 3 more of my accounts, and leave them all
logged in with 30 items each, thats 120.. almost covers my banked junk pile
