"The character move form doesn't ask for the original CC info and/or the

True the FORM does not, but you WILL get asked if the two accounts do not 
match. I tried to move a character from an account that was given to me long 
ago, and even though I had been paying for the account for 2 years, I was 
told it was "no go" unless I could provide the ORIGINAL billing (first 4 and 
last 4 numbers) and address information, and the CD key OR original email 
address.
----------

"When moving characters between accounts, billing information must be 
identical on both accounts and you must be the original owner of both 
accounts. You may use the credit card on file or submit a different credit 
card using the Billing Information fields. If the credit card holder is 
different from the holder of the card on file, please enter a short 
explanation in the bottom field. If you have only paid for your account with 
a Game Card, you must submit a credit card using the Billing Information 
fields."
