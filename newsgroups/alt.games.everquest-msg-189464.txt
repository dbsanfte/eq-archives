I bought the Player's Guide when I got back into the game and have been 
relatively happy with it.  It's got decent coverage of the early levels of 
each class type.  The Kunark guide has what was good information, but is 
now quite a bit outdated.  The Luclin guide's been mostly useless.  I have 
no idea if the spellbook is worth a damn.

They're all pretty redundant if you have a web connection, though.  I used 
them more when I couldn't alt-tab to a browser.
