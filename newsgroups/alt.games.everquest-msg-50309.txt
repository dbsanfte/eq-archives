The only thing I know of would be the kromzek spy, but he isn't really a
soloable mob, and in order to trigger him (he spawns from sentry
rotiart...spell that backwards), you have to already have fairly decent CoV
faction.

The kromzek spy is aggro to all, and factionless.

My recommendation during your foraging would be to play gems, or maybe have
a good book handy.
