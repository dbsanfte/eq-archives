Too expand on what I said to DT:

When my mage was in his 30's (right around Velious release)
I fought grouped in OT - A ZEM of 75 and a full group bonus
of 1.2.  That meant the base mob xp for a level 35 mob was

35*35*1.2*75 = 110,250 per mob, split the usual way.

I saw level 29 healers in those groups.

To get through 29 used to require (before hell level smoothing)
(29*29*29*1.1*1000) - (28*28*28*1.1*1000) = 2,680,700.

If they were grouped with 5 other 35's (DPS classes needed to
be nearer 35 to be effective) they got

.145 * 110,250 per 35 mob kill, or 15,986 per kill.

15,986/ 2,680,700 = or about 3/5ths of a percent per kill, or
150 kills per level. 

I distinctly remember getting a level every 5 hours (except 
hell levels) so we must have been pulling 30+ mobs per hour
(not very hard for a chain pulling group).

Now with a high 20's to 30 group we are fighting Sol A,
group bonus is now 2.16 for 6 people, ZEM is 130 - a level
30 mob there gives -

30*30*2.16*130 = 252,720 per mob.  Yes, over *TWICE* as much
xp per mob that is *5* levels lower than what we fought in
OT so long ago.

Our current healer is a 29 then 30 druid - she needed the
same 2,680,700 xp to get through (maybe a bit more from hell
level smoothing, but not much).

The rest of the group is high 20's, let's fudge and say 30
because that's erring low for how much xp the druid gets.

Now the druid gets 42,150 per kill - 42,150/2,680,700 = 1.5%
per kill.  This requires 66 kills to get through 29.  Even at
only 22 kills per hour she still goes through 29 in 3 hours.


So, in conclusion, my observations that levels used to take
5 hours in chain pull groups in OT and now take <3 hours in
chain pull groups in a dungeon is born out by the numbers.

No PL'ing required.  PL'ing results in a level an hour (or
better - we had people getting as much as 1.5 yellow per pull
when we were PL'ing)

Oh, and prior to the PL'ing bonanza that druid was more than
capable of healing us in a straightup group situation with a
bard MT.  So, at 30 they have no problems (I've seen it), in
PoP they are very useful (almost all outdoor zones), they can
solo with ease through all the levels, at high levels they 
bring a lot to raids (MGB/SoTW is very useful).  Yeah, they
may have a bit tougher time from 39 to mid-50's than some, but
they also solo far better than all but a few classes during
those levels.
