I guess if all you think soloers want to do is farm tradeskills, goof 
off with your epic (Kunark era), farm pp, and help random people then 
yeah you might be right.

Me, I think bigger. And I can see what raiders can do with their spare 
solo time. And I'd like to be able to do some of that. I'm willing to 
put in the the -time-, I'm willing to put in the -effort-. I'm not 
willing or able to hook up with 70 other people on a regular basis to 
make it happen though.

Wow. Dead wrong. 

Its beyond arrogant to suggest that someone who got as far as they can 
go in the non-raid segment of EQ of being a slacker who bums his way up. 
Let me assure you the soloers and the single groupers work their asses 
off. They -have- to, if they don't kill the mobs, the mobs don't die.

Yet I know any number of raiders who are afk half the time and get 
awarded 'raid loot' when all they did was autofollow a cleric, assist a 
MT, and turn autofire on on their gamepad, while watching CSI. That 
being a routine raid of course, but they still get better loot doing -
that- then the soloer or even single group in soloable/groupable gear 
will get for even their most miraculous victories.

'That ain't right!'

You see, I don't object to the best loot in the game dropping from 
endgame raid encounters. I object to the

2nd best loot in the game dropping from almost endgame raid encounters

3rd best loot in the game dropping in soloable zones I need a raid to 
get into

4th best loot in the game being purchasable in the bazaar from other 
peoples raids

5th best loot in the game being bazaar junk that's actually affordable 
to someone who isn't selling the 4th best gear, 

6th best gear being soloable/groupable but only if your equipped in 
better than 6th best gear already.

7th best gear is actually legitimately obtainable by 65th level soloers 
and groupers who are not current or ex-raiders.

Basically, I think that the gear actually obtainable by 65th soloers and 
groupers who are not current/exraiders should be 2nd to 3rd best gear.

Why do you object to that?

Why do you feel the need to call me a 'slacker who bums his way up'?

> that is all most people NEED.

That is all most raiders NEED too. 5 maybe 6 people on the average raid 
NEED better than LDON gear, the rest do not.

And telling solo/group players they should equip in Bazaar gear 
demonstrates how bad the situation is! 

You are telling them that not only are they unable to raid because they 
don't have enough regular friends, but they should probably not bother 
challenging the best content they can take because they can get better 
gear farming pp off rathe giants and other pp farms and buy the junk you 
can't use, because its better than anything they can get for themselves. 

That is not -interesting- to that segment of the playerbase, probably no 
more than playing -that- eq would be to you. Yet that is the reality... 
Bazaar junk is better than almost anything they can get for themselves 
'legitimately'.

Actually that was your suggestion. "farming tradeskill items".

Your alternatives... pp farming in rathe/dulak, working on an obsolete 
epic, doing tradeskills, and helping random people are all about as 
unfulfilling as farming the spiders, and hardly represent 'more than 
enough solo content'.

Actually, of all those things, I'd find helping random people the most 
fulfilling, but it does my character little good, and hardly counts as 
solo content in my books.
