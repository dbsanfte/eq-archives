My suggestion would be Kurn's Tower in Kunark, in the Field of Bone zone.  It is
THE place for an SK your level.  The entire upper part of the tower is all
skeleys, so you will get tons of bone chips.  I'm soloed my SK from 12 to 15
there in about 8 hours and have got over a backpack full of chips.  The place is
almost always empty too.  You can bind in the ruins in the FoB zone as well, so
it's very nice.  No merchants though, but there's not much in the way of loot to
sell anyway.

I also agree with wisps in Erud's Crossing, you can get good xp and great money
by doing the GLS quest.  

Good luck.
