Well, I still hate the bastard, but even then, I gave him props when I think
he did the right thing.  It was just so rare...  And yes, I think he was
right when he bombed Iraq in '98.  The timing may have been chosen for
different reason, but the action was justified.

Even so, most of the things I think Clinton did wrong I believe he thought
was right.  It's the few things he did for purely selfish reasons (like
selling the Chinese targeting tech for their missles) that are very, very
disasterous.  And, let's face it, the scandals were still of his own making
(well, his and Albert "no controlling legal authority" Gore's).  The big
one, though, was split blame between the Republicans for prying where they
shouldn't have, and Clinton for lying instead of telling the Reps to mind
their own business.
