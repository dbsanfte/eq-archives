I was not disagreeing with that sentiment, merely saying that the 
mechanics are there for the amount of time to create an item to change 
based on how difficult it is to make.  In fact, I wholeheartedly agree, 
tradeskilling is tedious as all getout.  This is true in both EQ1 and EQ2 
by the way.  Overall, I'd say it is more rewarding in EQ2, it is far 
easier to get to a point of making useful items, if you level your 
tradeskill along with your adventure level at about the same rate.
