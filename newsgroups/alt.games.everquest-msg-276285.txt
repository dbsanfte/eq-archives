I have both bought and sold.  I sold some stuff in EQ a long time ago.
Think I got $300 for SSoY.

In SWG around when the holocrons first came out I was going out hunting
for hrs trying to get one.  I spent 4 days at least 6hrs a night trying
to get a drop.  I looked at the time I was spending and thought i could
definately make better use.  I ended up buy 10million credits to buy a
couple holocrons.  I figured then I could at least be working towards a
profession.  To me the money didn't matter so much because I was
putting in huge amounts of time.

Months later I sold my SWG account for $2k.  DO I feel bad about it.
No not at all.  I don't see how it harms anyone that someone bought my
account.  Somebody obviously wants to play without doing the legwork.
More power too them.
