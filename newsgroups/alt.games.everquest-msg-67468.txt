I was in the Lair with my trusty mage pet when I turned around and couldn't
locate him.  I think to myself "No prob...I'll just use the Summon Companion
spell" which I had newly acquired.  This was the very first time I had tried
the spell.  After casting, I heard the sound of my pet suiciding...grrr.
So I try to cast a new pet and it immediately suicides.  I try again and the
same thing happened.   So I made my way out into the main corridor (outside
of tunnels) and was able to cast a new pet there.

Maybe it is just a pathing problem (i've had pets suicide in dungeons before
for no apparent reason) but I've never been in a dungeon where I could not
cast for a new pet.  Any thoughts?
