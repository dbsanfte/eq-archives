Thought I'd give the Bard a try since I've only grouped with one that's been
worth a damn in the tim I've been playing EQ.  Anyone have any tips?

Started by dumping all points into Strength (95).

My stamina is a piddly 65, and I only have 26 hitpoints. (I'm a wuss, I
know).  I created a second, just to see what 75 stamina would do, and it
only gave me 27 hit points.

Question is, which is better?  I'm starting to think the latter, simply
because of fighting and more stamina before I tire.....

I didn't dump any points into Dex because I figure dex items are fairly
cheap.

Any pointers or advice?

Thanks.
