I play both, so, I don't need to filter them, it's just handy to know 
which game is being talked about.  Given that this is the Everquest 
newsgroup, not the EverquestII newsgroup, EQ2 labelling should be 
sufficient.

If you have a decent newsreader, you can set it to score the EQ2 labeled 
threads high, and ignore the low scoring threads...

If you don't, well, fix that.
