Actually, KEI at lower levels makes a Druid *master* of all trades. If 
you can spam inefficient heals all the time without fear of running out 
of mana (aggro issues aside), you can replace a Cleric. If you can spam 
second-best nukes without running out of mana, you can be a Wizard too. 
It's just not cricket.
