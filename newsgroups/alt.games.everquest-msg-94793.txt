Quadding at 34 was tough for me. I had about 160ish wisdom, nothing
uber.  I did it on tizmats in great divide.  Not as many hp and don't
hit as hard as cougars.  And if you mess up can still damage shield
self and tank em a few to get em to run.

Downside is, maybe not as good xp, hardly any loot and will become kos
to them.  LIke that matters. Still was nice place to practice.
