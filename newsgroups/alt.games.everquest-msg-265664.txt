All,

Since the game is coming out within a week, and people have been
playing beta (and wasn't the NDA lifted?), are there any sites with
good spell lists? I've looked at Stratics and Warcry but I am
interface challenged. Other than minor examples or partial lists, I
don't see much about the spells I'll be casting. Are there any sites
that catalogue this?

Also, I can't tell for sure, but it looks like every level 10
specialist specializes again at level 20 based on alignment. Is this
true? I would find it most unsatisfying to be unable to be an evil
wizard. I set people on fire and I can't be evil? Just curious if all
level 20 specializations are based around alignment or if it varies?
