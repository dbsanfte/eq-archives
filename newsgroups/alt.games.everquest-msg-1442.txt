Well, a friend's enchanter has changed his characters, so we needed an 
enchanter. I've been meening to play one for a while, so I made one, but 
now I need some advices, as I've never played an int caster :)
What int and cha items can do into the primary hand?
What's a good level of charisma for an enchanter that plans to spend 
most of his time mezzing and charming things?
Are gnomes that bad? For some reason I've never seen a gnome enchanter 
higher than level 20
I put my starting points such that my starting cha is 95 and int is 113, 
will that do?
How is it easier to powerlevel an enchanter with a shaman? Shaman is 51, 
without JBB. No, my skills won't be 0, and no, I'm not gonna kill anyone 
due to my lack of knowledge on how to play
Can tinkering bring at least enough profit to pay for itself?
Are there any useful quests I can do for the enchanter? I hate camping 
for stuff
