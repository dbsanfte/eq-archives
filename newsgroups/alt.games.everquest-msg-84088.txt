he was in the beta. I clicked on him during it and it had some weird
name like the "Megalodon." He had general movement problems of some
type besides really being too high for that zone in general. Several
such things were in the beta just to see what they could do as far as
I know, among them was a giant kobold in swamp of no hope who was
removed before final. I remember how that kobold scared the bejudas
out of people. 

They were testing size I'm pretty sure and areas like Sol b, fear,
hate, etc (and I think permafrost.. or at least the part with vox)
which had larger mobs were not even in the game at final but came out
some time later when my moderately slow leveling shaman was 25 or so.
I remember making level 1 ogres with some other people and going and
checking out fear (much to the chagrin of a guild there doing it since
such activity was causing them to be trained sometimes) and getting
killed by a spider quite rapidly.
