I know some of you guys are real fans of Tolkins work, but I think you might
reconsider comparring him to a god.

For those of you who do not know this, Mr. Tolkin was a devout Catholic,
calling him a god would not be what he would want.  To him there was but one
God, and to consider a human being a god was out right sin (very bad).

He wrote The Lord of the Rings to protray Christianity (much like C.S. Lewis
did when he wrote the Chronicals of Narniea).
