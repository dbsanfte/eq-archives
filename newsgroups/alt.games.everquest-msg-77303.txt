First off, CR:
L39 cleric and an understanding cleric with epic works best. Camp the
L39 cleric, convince the epic cleric to take the low exp return res,
then get him clicking away. Unlikely you could afford to lose an epic
level cleric.

As for groups:

MT Group:

Biggest, Baddest, highest level, highest AC Warrior you have (L55 or
above a big plus for defensive)
Cleric
Paladin
Bard (twisting damage shield and resist songs with manasong if he can
triple twist)
If you have an enc with the +agro spells (L55?) put him in here chaining
the MT
If you have a necro with the group tap/buff spells put him in here
If you have a SK necro with the group tap/buff spells put him in here
Fill up any spaces with paladins, then clerics.

Backup MT group:
As above, but MT group gets priority

Melee Damage groups:
Cleric
Bard (singing resist and meleebuff songs)
4 rogues or other high damage melees

Nuke damage groups
Cleric if you got one spare, otherwise shamam works well
Bard (singing manasong/resists) if any available
4 x nukers
Hide from AE between breaths if it's feasible

Rangers with trueshot:
Group em up and fire away from out of AE range. Don't really need a
healer for that.

Other groups form up around the remaining healers.

MOST IMPORTANT:
1: Don't get hit by melee if you aren't the MT. If you get agro TURN OFF
ATTACK and take a SINGLE step back. If you still got agro, grab you
ankles and prepare for the inevitable.

2: Heal the MT. I don't care who is being hit, keep the MT supplied with
heals.

As the fight progresses, and people start getting low on HPs from the AE
or ripostes, throw the occasional heal on your group to keep them going,
but make sure the MT is getting enough healing. Much better for one
rogue or wizard to die, than have the MT die, and the mob go chomping
through random members of the raid. If you're below 2 bubs hps, don't
ever run to the casters for a heal, or the dragon will chase you because
of low hp agro.

If MT dies, ease off attacking/nuking a little to allow the backup MT to
establish himself. As soon as you hear the 'MT has been slain' message,
switch to chaining the backup tank with heals.

What to tell the raid:
Bring resist gear, no afks, pay attention, don't complain.
