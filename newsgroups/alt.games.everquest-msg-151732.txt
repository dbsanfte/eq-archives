It depends what you want from the game.

Levelling a Wizard to 60 is not as easy as a druid but both classes can solo
when you can't group.

But what to do at 60? If you want to carry on in the game at high end, with
a raiding guild to enter high end dungeons like NToV etc then a Wizard would
be in much higher demand than the druid class. Druids tend to be a saturated
class in raid guilds. Wizards a valuable for the massive DPS they do against
the high end mobs.
