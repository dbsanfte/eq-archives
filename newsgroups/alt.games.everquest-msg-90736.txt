Just out of interest, as I don't play the End game, if you have your MA and
SA (both Warriors) is there any need for any other warriors in the raid?
Surely once those 2 spots are filled it would be better to have Rogues,
Monks and Rangers as the other Melee's (not sure how Pally's and SK's
compare to Dam output to a warrior but the 3 I listed certainly should out
damage one)
