Well, it depends on whether hard pathing data (patrol routes, routes 
around obstacles and specific "use the bridge/gate/road" behaviour) is 
built within the file format of the zone itself, rather than as a 
separate file like the monsters and sounds are. Of course, the latter 
makes a lot more sense, but I'm afraid I believe the former is true.

A way to fix pathing issues would be to create a new version of the 
client that ignores pathing data in the zone geometry file, and refers 
instead to pathing data in a freshly downloaded file that *only* 
contains the paths for that specific zone. This would make sense in 
theory, but I don't know how hard it would be to implement, code-wise.
