 You don't have to tell me. I play a level 60 Wiz and I can't go 5
minutes in the game with anon off without getting:
 
 1) Urgent pleas for me to join a raid
 2) Invites to join a guild (just left my old one)
 3) Urgent pleas for group gates or TLs
 4) Urgent pleas to gate 4 - 6 groups to Hate or Sky.
 5) Urgent pleas for me to use Hsagra's Wrath (Giants Bane) on 
    some Uber Giant.
 
 Frankly I get pestered so often I don't want to play any more. Even
when anon, there's still a lot of people that know me and pester me
anyway.
