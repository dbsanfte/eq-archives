OK, I'm ready to move ahead with the cleric epic quest after doing the two
boring camps at the beginning. I've inspired some of my other guild clerics
to join in, so we've got several people at about the same level in the
quest. Since the next few steps require 1-5 teams I was thinking of having a
"Cleric Epic Day".

So my question is: do these epic NPCs respawn quickly enough for us to do
this repeatedly in one day? Even if they don't immediately respawn but
respawn in an hour or so we could do a complete cycle then come back and
start again.

1) Plasmatic Priest in Temple of Solusek
2) Ixiblat Fer in Burning Woods
3) Overking Bathezid Di'Zok in Chardok
4) Zordak Ragefire and Zordakalicus Ragefire

Thanks,
