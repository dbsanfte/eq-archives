I once was ina MUD type of text based game and it had that. You had to
advance through all classes to level 50 (8 classes, it was much faster than
advancing in EQ), then you became a 'Super Avatar'. These guys had
unlimited mana, but could suddenly use all buff/heal spells only on themselves
and not others, They still could damage everything. It works out remarkably
well and did not introduce any game instability, since no SAV was going
to play funnies in newbie ares .. they just grouped to kill ubermobs and
it was still a dangerous thing, even with no mana limits. However, it
did not have as many players as EQ, there fore less grouping and thus
no healers constantly healing etc .. still, it was fun :) 
I'd not want this in EQ though, I think the current system is ok .. 
now I only want about 4 gems more (yes, my original wanting the double
is maybe too much). I liked the idea of getting a spellslot every so and so
levels.
