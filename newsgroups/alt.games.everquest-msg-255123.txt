Situation is worse then most people think. Raiding generally sucks pretty
much bad. Challenging encounters requiring exacting procedures are fun the
first time you succed but the rest of the time is just mind numbing boring.
Spend 4 hrs and get a few people really absurd equipment. If the equipment
gets nerfed then no one and i mean NO ONE raids. It is not uncommon at all
for people to get geared up and then to stop raiding and go back to casual
play with the nice gear. We raid for the gear and for very little else. The
two groups are indeed WIDELY divergent now though.

The big mistake they made was ever including raiding at all. (vox nagfen are
at fault i think) The only way to fix the problem now is to make all
equipment droppable. This over a period of maybe a year averages the
equipment that everyone is wearing but comes at great cost. The raiders no
longer feel so special. The overall equipment level rises substantially
gimping some content and the non raiders suddenly feel very broke.
