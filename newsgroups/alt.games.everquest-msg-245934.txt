Have to agree with Lief on this one too.  If anything, jolt will
reduce aggro even when resisted.  I have never to my knowledge, ever
gained agro from a resisted jolt.  The only thing I can suggest is
that:

1) After the spell finished you continued meleeing, perhaps getting a
proc, and got aggro from that, or;
2) The mob didn't turn on you, it only stopped attacking its main
target to cast on you.

I regularly see mobs turn away, on resisted jolts, the instant the
spell is resisted.  I see it often enough that in my opinion there is
no way that it does not reduce hate, at least partially and some of
the time, when resisted.  Not only does the mob turn away (which could
conceivably happen just because you stopped attacking for a moment to
cast) but it turns away on cue, right when the spell is resisted...not
a tenth of a second sooner or later.
