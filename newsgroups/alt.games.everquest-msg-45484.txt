See the everquest developer's discussion board
for details.

It's pretty interesting. I created a druid to
try the system out. While the GFay newbie areas
were packed, people were actually being very
considerate of one another. There was a ripple
of surprise when a dwarf showed up. Of course he
couldn't speak to anyone, so the effect was of
alienness that was very spooky and effective. A
gnome later on caused the same stir.

While being a >5 level newbie is fairly lame,
the over-all impression was good. What remains
to be seen is whether the high demand will
continue after 2-3 days.
