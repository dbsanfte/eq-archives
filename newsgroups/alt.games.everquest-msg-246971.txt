So why couldn't they have GMs in the work-at-home style? Don't guides do 
most of their work in game with in game sort of tools and commands? I 
know a lot of people who have enough computer sitting on their desk that 
flipping out into a work environment is no big deal. Surely SOE could 
manage some sort of online network working environment as I KNOW there 
are customer service programs that are designed for customer support 
from home.

I dont know about you, but if I could get a job working CS at home for 
SOE, I would jump at it for a minimum wage subcontractor status...I will 
deal with my own withholdings and medical insurance...and I would have 
no problem working the 11pm-8am shift either. Heck, I am in game at 
least 8 hours a day doing boring pointless farming, running around 
dealing with problems might be annoying but not boring;)
