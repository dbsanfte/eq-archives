Next time you die, don't loot the body all the way.  Most people
have a trinket they can leave on the body in case a rez isn't
handy, leave that.  For a cleric, this item could be anythign in
the ammo slot, or the summoned hammer.

Anyway, rez the body again.  This is a "no exp" rez, of course,
but since its just an epic click there's no real expense to it.
Now go do something dangerous, like trying to recover the bodies
of your friends, or training mobs away from said bodies so
someone else can move them.  Get yourself truely deeply in
trouble if you like, as long as you aren't in danger of Immediate
death.  Now click yes.

Bang, back to your body, no waiting for a COH or anything, and
all aggro cleared.

I have a Donals BP, so I'm not spending mana (which takes time to
get after rez) to get full health, heck, throw on Valor from my
arms while I'm at it.  I'm still an eggshell at about 2/3rds my
normal operating HP, but as long as I can withstand even a second
of whatever the mobs are dishing out, I have that "get out of
jail free" card all ready to go.

This rez box really lasts far longer than I ever thought, I had
it up for at least half an hour last night, just as an
experiment.

One thing this calls into question; all those people who have
told me "I wasn't paying attention and now the box is gone, can
you rez me again"... what were they up to?  The box does NOT go
away unless you zone or get a COH or more than half an hour
passes (and I suspect much longer than this, just know at least
half an hour is fine)

I now understand some strategic coments made in earlier
conversations here that never really clicked for me.  In a bad
combat, if I can click rez on at least one fallen cleric and one
fallen monk who are dead in a safe spot, and they don't accept or
turn down the rez, then the rest of my raid can wipe out to the
man and still get a nice quick recovery once the mobs have
returned to their spawn sites.

We also used this to get a number of KOS people in to a combat in
TOV recently; we'd wiped after clearing the little KOS critters
while trying to take down a big dragon (aary?) and for our second
try, rezed everyone but had the KOS people not accept.  The non
KOS got healed and buffed up, and then started clearing repops,
and the KOS accepted and came in all in a mass wave, got mass
Aego and mass Focus and helped out; if they had accepted one at a
time this would have taken too long.

Brell knows its nice to have some use for the thing over and
above normal rezing purposes... its sure no good as a weapon.
