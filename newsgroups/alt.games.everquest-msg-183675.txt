It is a known fact vikings discovered america long before Columbus did, and
probably someone before the vikings, so that isn't what is amazing with the
Piri Reis map, not only that but there is something called "native
americans" (real americans) who lived there before Columbus came. In recent
time old school books still haven't updated to reflect the current proof and
still states Columbus found it.
However, what the real mystery is all about, is the charted area over the
northern coast of Antarctica which shows you Antarctica without the icecap.
