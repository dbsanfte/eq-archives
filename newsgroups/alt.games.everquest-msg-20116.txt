Thats a very good point, Cel - regarding the descriptive last names.
This is why I have no problem with names like Smith, Fisher, Tailor or
descendants of such (Smythe, Ficher, Taylor). As you say, this was
once a very valid way for people to create last names (hence all the
bloody Smiths in the world - either that or they breed like rabbits)

But Goodhealer, Masterforger, or SilkyBoy - well, they arent received
very well.

I think the worst thing is that Im sure we all know somewhere out
there, someone either has it, or is thinking about it...
