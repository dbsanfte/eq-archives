Its all indiff. Essentially there really is no evil or good side, the
good size will just diss you while the evil will diss you if you are
good. Evidently this may only prevent some quests.

One thing that bothered me was that it is not your "alignment" 
in ways that I thought it was. It seems to instead just be the
stereotype alignment of your race/class/diety. I thought perhaps since
my dark elf cleric has max allied with so many good factions at least
some of the good npcs would comment on it being good, but no.

POK is totally non combat/non kos. You can't accidently attack or cast
on an npc, nor will any attack you. Its kind of like "supression gas"
idea in Anarchy Online ;)
