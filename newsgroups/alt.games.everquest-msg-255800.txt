Having played the game for all of TWO DAYS! (woot) I can give one tiny
"ooh, that's neat" part about the tradeskill system. Namely that you can
decide to lower the amount of resources you use for an attempt if you are
willing to decrease your chance of success.   And that the crafting window
is awfully complex and full of...stuff.

But someone more experienced than I can say more.

I do suspect that the crafting system in EQ2 stands a chance of eclipsing
that of Horizons, because the Horizons crafting is still just "gather the
components and hit combine" at the end of the day, whilse EQ2 will be an
actual mini-combat, with the forge overheating and underheating and the
like, and you having to react quickly to fix it.
