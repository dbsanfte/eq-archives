Excuse the high-end-newbiness, but are we talking about the chanter
spell Rune V here? I thought that was just a damage absorber like the
Necro's self only skin line, which absorbs "x" amount of damage? Does
that somehow stop the mob's procc from going off? Or am I befuddled
again and thinking of a different spell?
