PoP Draughts are awesome, easily attainable upgrades. Agnarr's Thunder is a
great nuke. Strike of Solusek is the most mana-efficient DD spell the wizard
gets, and can crit for more than 6,000 points of damage. I agree, the wizard
got some REALLY LAME PoP spells (Greater Decession, anyone?), but saying
they got no PoP nuke upgrades is simply incorrect.
