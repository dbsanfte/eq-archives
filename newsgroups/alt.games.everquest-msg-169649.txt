First the question, you mentioned in chat that there were plenty of DPS
comparisons on the net, err, I can't find them.  If you know where they are,
please tell me, otherwise I'll just have to search harder.

Second, any melee classes that parse their DPS, please give it and your
stats/equip/aa stuff.  Particularly level/class/weapons and AAs such as
ambidex/cf/feroc, and any AoB/veng items.

Anyways, argument with a 55 monk in my guild (avg equip, like SoS/wu stick,
maybe tstaff at most), who claimed to have 150 dps (estimated, not direct
parse, which would obviously fix the whole thing, thx empirical evidence)
after I mentioned that my pets in PoD and Kael parsed out around 200 dps,
the obvious wrongness made me want to jab my eye out, since Martin mentioned
in chat that with ambidex/feroc3/primal/GMU/veng3/2xAoB he was around 100
dps (estimated).

Only things I could find were a graph putting 60 rogue (I guess avg equip?)
at 58 dps, 60 monk around 45 dps, 60 wizzy around 40 dps. (guess graph may
be a tad outdated)

me + numbercrunching + /guildsay = guild tells you to shut up.  =/  They
dont' like me calculating how spectacular they're about to fail on exe trial
I guess.

BTW, I ended up with one fight in Kael that parsed my pet at an obscene 356
dps.  I was like OMFG when I saw that.  But then I also had a fight that
parsed the same pet in at a piddly 170 dps.  /shrug

I think I next time I'm there w/ a pet, I'll have to get a fight where I'm
in range for the whole fight, too often I'm just too far away to get most of
the hit message. =/
