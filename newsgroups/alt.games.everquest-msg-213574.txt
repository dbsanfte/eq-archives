Got home last night, went on Internet Explorer and surfed for all of
one min before my PC reboots.  "Odd.." I think...  After 4-5 times
"This is now pissing me off"  I thunk..  Anyone know what could be the
reason for this?  I thought of a faulty power supply/connection,
updated my virus defs, ran a scan which turned up clean.  Anyone else
have a similar problem?  How did ya fix it?  Will trade out the power
supply if all else fails, but it is only a year old or so.

Running an AMD 1800 chip, Windows 98 SE...  I haven't gone in game to
see if it boots while I play.  That could be a major hassle.
