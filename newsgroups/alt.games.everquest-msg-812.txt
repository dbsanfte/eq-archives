Go to Kunark. Plenty of work there. And that way you can grow tired of
camping the same Sarnaks/Goblins/Frogloks etc. Don't forget that you
are the scourge of undead. Unrest in Faydwer might be a good option.
That way you get to med/nuke/med/stun/med/heal. Giant Skeletons in the
Rathe Mountains also come to mind. You can go to Upper Guk, and
eventually you can go to the Dead side of Lower Guk. But I hear you
when you say that EQ can get boring sometimes camping the same stuff
over and over again. There isn't much that can be done about that. I
play a Necro right now, and while I enjoy the power that he has, I
think I am a melee person at heart. It gets tiresome constantly
medding.
