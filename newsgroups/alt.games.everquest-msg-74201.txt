Personally I rather not complicate things more than they have to and then
say it cannot be done.  Knowing what obstacles are in your path is always a
good step to reaching your goal(s).

They already have inn's in various places with keys for rooms or keys such
in unrest that are totally meaningless.  These could definitely be utilized
to further the banking idea.

Trying to look second-hand guess into their code as I see it and as a
programmer/system's analyst myself, I don't see them being able to easily
allow others except the user to toggle into others banks, even with a lore
"key".  The current system is such that you click on the bank you get your
bank.  If you tried to also set them up with a key to get into someone
else's bank, this doen't seem all that feasible, as the people aren't the
objects like the tomato you use with the seb.  I cannot think of one
instance where you would have a key to use on a person, besides just giving
it to them for some quest.  Thus I think the current system is based on
objects / people.

The only way to actually have this work would be to create a new object that
would give people this added functionality.

So simply, the giving of the key wouldn't be enough to allow you to access
another person's bank without a place to get into it.

This would require them to create a new object to access another person's
bank, which I don't see happening even if they jumped at the idea, because
they are working on the vendor - bazaar situation.

Give us a way to access other's banks / way to give access to others.

still love the idea.   : )
