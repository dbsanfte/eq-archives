I confirm that unless you've deliberately been doing negative faction work,
an erudite necro can happily walk naked and unbuffed by any spell whatsoever

across Erud.  Perhaps not the palace zone, mind you, but certainly the
zone you need to cross to get to the dock.  There -are- KOS mobs
in there, but you'd have to go out of your way to find them, and they
don't wander anywhere near the path to the docks.

Qeynos, now, you will be KOS in without work, but there of course you
need merely dive off the boat and swim down to the sewers, where
you are -not- KOS to the Bloodsabres.  Out the "secret" entrance
where the Queen Kliknik spawns and you are home free, having never
passed close to a single KOS mob.
