The inability to rez outside the group is a bug, hopefully to be fixed
in the upcoming big patch.  Not being able to heal I think is worth it
for stopping powerleveling and the like, but what I don't get is why
you can't invite people while in a locked encounter?  Since the
encounter rewards aren't determined until you finish, it wouldn't let
you get exp/loot from greys.  I can't see any problems with it, and it
would make it so you could help people beat an encounter and still be
rewarded, as long as the reward would have been yours had you grouped
to begin with.

I like the tradeskilling system itself, the process of crafting, but
the dependency on others can become tedious and not being able to sell
while playing makes it too much of a money sink for me unless I can
find people to exchange services with.
