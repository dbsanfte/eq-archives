I hate to say anything bad about Rodney, but I think Fred really hit his
groove once he started going solo.  Hell, things have actually started to
move.  If you gave up before chapter 3, I'd recommend going back.  Now that
Fred's doing this full-time, it's picked up.

Hmm, I just realized, there's really no eye-candy for the girls in MT.  I
mean, Piro and Largo just don't cut it, and Jumpei is cool, but the only
real bishonnen is Yuki's dad...  ^_^;;;;
