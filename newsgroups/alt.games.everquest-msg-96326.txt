Even my, at the time, level 9, ranger just makes the run, keeping an eye out
for spiders.  So far, he has died once in 8 runs.  No Sow, no Cammo.  I
usually take the tunnel from FV to shore, then just run towards the LoIO
zone, watching for spiders on the way.  At his level, all it takes is one to
kill him very quickly.
