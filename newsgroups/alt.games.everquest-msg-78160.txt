Nope...most zones are fine most of the time...some zones can
get really busy (200 people in G. Fay slows things down, for
instance) and cause lag like any other over-the-internet game.

The good thing is, unless you're a bard, you don't really need
constant low-low ping and lightning fast reflexes.  Bouncing around
in combat doesn't really do much _in general_, so it's not as
important as in Unreal Tournament or something.  I've played
at my parent's house over vacations and ended up with an
out-in-the-boonies-copper-wire connection running at 22000
or so, and as long as I didn't hang out in LOIO or something
I was fine.
