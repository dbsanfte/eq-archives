I don't recall ever having that happen to me, but I guess it could and 
now it can't.

Yeah, by adding in a one point nuke, you wake a mezzed target and then 
the pet will attack it (assuming it works as intended, haven't got a 
report yet)

Gift of Magic is one of the best AA out there, every time you cast 
certain sorts of spells (heals, nukes) there is a chance it will 
trigger, and then the next spell you cast costs 1 mana.  When Raging 
Servant was strictly pet summon, it didn't count for this purpose, even 
though its in many ways a damage spell that mages tend to chain cast, 
rather than a summon that gets cast once well before the fight.

Its also incredibly expensive to cast, casting it for one mana is much 
more efficient as you can imagine.  I don't think this change was 
necessary to do that however, I believe previously you could chain cast 
an ordinary nuke till GOM triggered and then cast a RS.

Aha that solves that riddle, go go out of date resources!
