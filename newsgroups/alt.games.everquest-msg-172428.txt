Just for fun, and because I had lots of cash to blow, I decided that my
Enchanter should take up jewlcraft when she was level 24.  Now that she's
29, her skill is at 190 or so.  She's made some nice stuff, including
Silvered Ruby Veils, Silver Diamond Wedding Rings, etc.  What items of
silver, electrum or gold jewelry sell the best to players? And what's the
best to put at bazaar?  I'm not into Platinum or Velium yet.

Thanks!

Chantriss
High Elf Enchanter
