> just stay on 100% normal exp till 65. aa's are much easier to
get at 65.

This is another Myth IMHO that we shouldnt be telling people.

At 65, a lot more mobs are green and you dont get xp. I've been
holding my cleric at 58 doing his AA's and find it far easier to
get them than my 65 BL can, just for this reason.
