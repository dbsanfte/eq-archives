Aye, I too found it to be a good zone, xp-wise, for the reasons you
mention.  Being a Dark Elf, I could always do a runner past the Golems
and into safety, if there was no zone line handy.  Of course, that was
in the days when zoning meant losing the pet, so we avoided zoning if
at all possible.  It must be a bit easier dodging into Skyfire and
out, now that the pet (and his summoned goodies) sticks with you!

The Ramp was always a good spot for buffs from passing megabeings, too
- at least in my lowly levels I considered them megabeings, heh.
