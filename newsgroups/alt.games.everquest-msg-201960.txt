I've seen ones like this and scratched them from my list of possible
guilds. I don't see why I should spend weeks applying to a guild,
chasing members to group with, finally getting accepted, to then find
out whether their calendar is accurate and they do bugger all.

I would strongly recommend your guild keeps its public calendar pages
current.
