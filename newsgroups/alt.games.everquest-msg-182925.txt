Nope doesn't bother me at all.  I've already spent hours and hours doing
nothing but retrieving corpses (the equivalent of sitting on the couch doing
nothing while everyone else is playing)

First of all, at level 16 you are playing a pretty boring game.  As you say
it's pretty much the same thing over and over again.  In another 5-10 levels
you will find dungeon exploring to be a lot more interesting than simple
outdoor fighting. Also, the idea of a corpse run in a dungeon gets a lot
more stressful than just running out to your loc and picking back up where
you left off.

Also, as has been mentioned a warrior is a pretty one dimensional class.  If
you want something that offers a little more diversity try a Necromancer,
ShadowKnight, Druid, Shaman, Bard or Beastlord.  Still keep in mind, that at
low levels ALL classes play basically the same game (at very low levels even
a necro can tank) it's not until you get into the mid 20's that the classes
really start to take on their own flavor.

There are other aspects to the game as well, such as quests and tradeskills
that offer their own diversion from the exp grind.
