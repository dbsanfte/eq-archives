Last night I was running around Thurgadin doing my normal vendor farming,
and at one point ran into the crowned statue just in front of the paladin
guild, at which point I clipped into the crown and couldn't get out.

Now, for those who say to sit down and mem gate, I couldn't sit - every time
I tried to, I'd sit down, but immediatly get back up;  not to mention that
even if I had gate memmed I couldn't cast it since I was stuck in the
ducking position.

It took a nice shaman with 2 shrinks to get me out (although one shrink was
enough for me to get enough room to sit down).

Anyways, this is as a Wood Elf, we aren't exactly ogre sized, so be careful
around that statue if you aren't a shortie.
