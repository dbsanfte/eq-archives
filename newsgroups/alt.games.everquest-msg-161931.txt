I play a Barbarian Shaman so I am kind of partial.  You will get Ultravision
at a fairly low level so the night blindness is not really that bad.
Shamans and Druids can both solo and work well in groups, but some Druids
have complained they have trouble getting groups at higher levels.  This may
be because there are so darn many of them.
