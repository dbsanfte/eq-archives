Before we go any further, a majority of my gaming background is in RPG. D&D,
GURPS, MUD, and even Vampire.

I understand how protocol works. And I didn't whine. I was actually quite
humble, and didn't even give attitude after they refused with the thought,
"I may need to ask again later."

I used the scenario as a brief example to what I have experienced thus far.
I have had 2 other encounters that were equally discouraging. I'm not
looking for special treatment at all. I was looking for a fun 'multi-player'
experience. I was told over and over that this was the way to go.

I've played RPG's for 15+ years, and whenever we got a newbie we helped them
all we could. Sure, there were frustrating moments when they didn't know how
to read the dice, or when they would send their lvl 3 Mage into the fray
with his trusty dagger. But like I said, it's a learning curve, and I
realize I'm behind it.

If you are offering to help, I would gladly accept. If you just wanted to
add fuel to the fire I'm getting in the flames so far, so be it.

On a side note; you may want to refrain from calling 30 year old men,"whiney
punks", in the future.

And my note at the bottom was a joke. I was trying to lighten the mood.
Thanks for defusing that.
