Yeah.  And while they're at it, I want them to completely homogenize all
races and classes.  I want my Ranger to be able to evade after evoking
his uber-taunt skill (which is usually done by walking into the room).  I want
my Enchanter to be able to melee and control her pet.  I want my melee types
to be able to bind and I want my Gnome Mage to be able to throw boulders.

Oh, and I want all my avatars to have WoodElf Hinnies, Barbarian Breasts
and HighElf Hair.  Well, at least the female ones.
