exp you get from a kill = mob level^2 * ZEM * class modifier * group bonus *
(your level+5)/group aggregate level

mob level - self-explanitory.

ZEM - Zone Experience Modifier.  The base modifier is 75 and is used for
most outdoor zones.  Dungeons are 80 and up.  I believe The Hole has the
highest modifier at ~93.

class modifier - offsets the class experience penalties.
War/Rog/WIS casters - 1.0
INT casters - 1.1
Mnk - 1.2
Hybrids - 1.4

group bonus - The bigger your group, the larger the bonus.
solo - 1.0
2 people - 1.02
3 people - 1.06
4 people - 1.10
5 people - 1.14
6 people - 1.20

group aggregate level - Add 5 to the level of each person in the group and
add them up.

If you kill a high light blue, the exp is 50% of that, if you kill a low
light blue, it's 25%.

If a pet does more than 50% of the damage in a group, it counts as a group
member and takes appropriate experience.
