Of course if the "shared bank slots" work across servers I would care less. 
If I really need to change servers, I could at least move the equipment to 
the new server. :) Or if it was simple to change servers (and not 50+ USD)
Or if it is really fun thru all the levels then restarting would not be too 
bad. I have restarted on FV about 6 times, all from 60+ characters, so I can 
obviously live with that decision, but I can see why some people would have 
heartaches.
