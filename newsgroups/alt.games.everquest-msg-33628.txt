    Remember, I have a seven second casting time on my main nuke. When I use
a lower casting time spell, like Sound of Force, IT gets off no problem. But
my main nuke can be interrupted by a good breeze.

    Never seen one of these. Insta-cast right click item?

    This one does. Most people I know keep Gate up unless they have another
escape route (Feign, they are the evaccer) or are grouped and desperately
need the spell slot.

>see most tend not to have any gate type spell memmed.

    Again, depends on the situation. I imagine a soloing Necro would have
Feign up, maybe Harmshield outdoors / Gate indoors. When I look at my low
level characters' spell lists, none of them have Gate - but they're all in
well-known areas with a "quick" way to a zone.

    About the only one you wouldn't see on a blue server is Shadowstep,
because it frequently doesn't help against a mob.
