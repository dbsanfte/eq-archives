Informed (as much as you can be) optimism and informed (as much as you 
can be) pessimism are balanced in idiocy (or lack thereof),

But as limited as hard data is, there are a number of people here who 
haven't looked at even that. And they come out of the woodwork saying 'I 
like EQ and am not interested in so much as reading the box on another 
game, because it won't be as good as EQ; I'll play EQ until they pull 
the plug, and then I'll never play anything else for as long as I 
live...' Sentiments like these are bordlerline fanatical.

Not exactly the same. Having the same access to information doesn't mean 
they actually accessed it. The overwhelming sentiment here is: "I 
*haven't* been keeping up with it because it will suck."

Cautious optimism like this is probably the most reasonable stance. 
Cautious pessimsm is pretty reasonable too, but constant pessimists 
(cautious or not) are irritating to be around.
