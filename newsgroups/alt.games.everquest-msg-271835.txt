Yep, I've heard of them, but I've also repeatedly heard that you 
shouldn't "waste" them at low levels, apparantly they are far more 
useful at 200.  Why, I'm not sure, but at a guess, its because some 
skills that were highly useful at lower levels eventually become 
useless, and using a reset point on a skill you have at 300 yeilds far 
more spare IP than using it on one you have at 120.

Or perhaps its because certain skills that were of negligable importance 
become necessities, and your only hope of buying them up to high levels 
is to kill some other less useful skill with a Reset point.

Or the advice to "save" them is simply the sort of bad advice that we do 
sometimes see in RPG forums, and I just don't know enough yet to know 
the difference; if there's one thing I know about AO, its that I'm still 
really in the dark about how much of the game operates.

I'm still looking for the Rosetta Stone of AO, the equivalent of EQ's 
Allakhazam... or heck, even the equivalent of Castersrealm!  Most of the 
forums I've found so far contain nothing but vague advice for newbies, 
and arguements about stuff at the 220+ level of the game.  Real nuts and 
bolts discussions of the mechanics are mysteriously missing!
