People advertise buffs in POK on Luclin just as they always have, 30% 
extended KEI, 15% extended Temp, so on and so forth.

But last night, for the first time, I saw the future of the buff 
advertising business.


Someone was advertising their specialty, a DMF I think it was, something 
off beat, at any rate, instead of the old percent extended, which means 
little to me, they were advertising the actual buff duration.

Struck me that THIS is how all buff duration hawking should be done, why 
should I have to try and figure out what the difference is between a 62 
chanter casting KEI at 45% extended and a 65 chanter casting KEI at 40% 
extended is?

Further, when I get the buff I can instantly confirm whether the caster 
was telling the truth or not, without having to go thru a series of 
arcance calculations.  Course I still remember the bad old days (what, 
last week?) when you could only tell how deep the BS was on the amount 
of extension by hitting time and then hitting it again an hour later 
when that buff that should have lasted 225 minutes wore off.

I use the 225 figure because I got hit by a MGB KEI last night and that 
was the duration, mighty impressive.

This strikes me as an ACTION event for the AGE crowd; to make this 
become the new default way for the various streetwalkers, er I mean buff 
vendors to hawk their wares might require a push, and I think we are 
positioned well to make that push, with members across half the servers 
in the tame, contacts within lots of guilds, and so forth.

What can we do?  How about a hot key message suggesting it in /ooc?  How 
about a hot key message suggesting it in a /ttell, so we can push the 
buffers directly?  How about buff casters deliberatly going to POK and 
using this style to do buff whoring for a while, even if you normally 
eschew such activities, just to help it catch on?  Users, chat one on 
one with your main pushers and see if you can get them to see the light.
