Ahaha talk about opposite land.... usually you have to continually beg
for spells like that if you WANT to be shrunk by a shaman in the
group. Overzealous shrinker.

I guess it would matter in first, I've played from third person from
behind since beta phase 3. I find it the easiest since all my
characters are viewed the same then (I adjust so their feet are about
an inch from bottom of screen) It seems the same to me if I'm a
halfling fighting something or an ogre, except the something is larger
compared to me of course. I tried first person a couple times but
found it HORRIBLE for melee, it was difficult to tell where you were
or where the other people were in relation to you plus that bobbing
around view of you and monster swinging in and out was awful.

I Love third for melee, casting, running around and knowing if stuff
is riding up on you to hit you.
