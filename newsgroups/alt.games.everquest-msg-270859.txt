Go into the little room where you port out to Rome/Athens etc; it says 
changing area when you go through the door so its a separate 'zone', and 
meet in there. Team up, and then return to newbie island. It appears to 
keep teams together. :)

You can also find out if you are together by pressing Shift-F9 and 
checking your group-selector. If they are the same your in the same 
instance.

warrior.... an Agent sneaking around with a high powered rifle...doesn't 
really feel like anything out of EQ.
