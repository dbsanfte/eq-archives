Well, blow me over, f___ me backwards and  shit on a stick.

Worked a treat adding the umbar and Tnl lines.

Frame rates down. Nicest of which is in hectic battles. Or maybe thats lag
better! No more turning away!
Loading and Zoning times way way better.
No crashing as yet 5hrs on and off.
And spell effects back, wow they're great when u haven't had them in a
while.

It's bliss... and just a cpl of lines. hehe

oh btw.

AMD K6 3D Now 450, 16mb matrox G400, 256 ram.

cheers
