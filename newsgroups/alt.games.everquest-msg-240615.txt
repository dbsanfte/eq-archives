I would say a decent idea. Not a great one, but decent. Those who have
lost characters and equipment due to decay in the past may disagree
and call it a dumbing down. I have never lost a character and
equipment due to decaying away, but this would alleviate some anxiety
about losing good equipment that might be irreplaceable if
circumstances meant I couldn't log on for more than a week. OTOH, if a
character died and the player hasn't been on long enough to undo the
rezz timer, will they allow for rezzes? I would think not, but who
knows.

I doubt that anyone who left multiple corpses to rot would be looting
them all unless the place holder item was valuable in and of itself.
So, they'd probably have to loot only one or two corpses (if they died
on the CR with additional equipment from the bank).
