Yep. You can be this won't happen again. Verant will lower the boom on
someone. Usually stuff like this happens once, like when a gm who was
cybering the leader of some guild or she used to work at verant or
something and he xferred her and her whole guild to some other server
with their gear. Players raised a stink and they got sent back and I
think that gm got the boot.
