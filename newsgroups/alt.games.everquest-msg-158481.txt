What makes a druid ? They can't fight as well, their buffs/debuffs aren't as
good in group situations under many conditions as shamans (or enchanters
with casters), they can't translocate, they certainly aren't kos to many
animal mobs (eg tigers, apes in ej start with kos), they can't heal as well
as a cleric...

but they could make decent money by porting other people, at least in the
mid levels, and that included running to them in wolf form or whatever to
get there fast, and that was an advantage over the wizard, and that is
something they have lost for good.

Being 51, i pretty much retired from porting and can make my cash slaying
beasties, but if i was in my 30's i'd be looking at the circle spells as
expensive and not very useful. Ok, you can still evac, so you are like a
wizard only you can't nuke as well.

I love my druid, and will continue to play with him, but i wouldn't advise
anyone to start one now.

And if you look in the description of druids in eq history, it was porting
and not being kos to animals that verant used to define the class initially.


Ok, lets change the argument a bit. They make 100 % rezzes available to
anyone who wants one. Would any cleric have a problem with that? After all,
it's a hassle rezzing people, and you had to use your mana, and these new
100 % rezzes (available from vending machines in every graveyard) would take
so much pressure of you. You can still buff and heal better than anyone. Why
should you think it is a bad thing for the game?

Why not have breeze/clarity/kei machines too? How about henchmen warriors,
npc's you can hire to slay beasts? Enchanters can still make jewlery better
than anyone, and warriors ... can ... smith or something.

Where do you draw the line at replacing pc abilities with in-game devices?
How much of what people do in eq should be automated? And made free and
better so that a pc can't even compete?

And is every opinion that differs from yours just a whine?
