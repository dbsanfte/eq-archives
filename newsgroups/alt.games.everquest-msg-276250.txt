In many (most?) mmrpg games equipment has more than just an 'item 
number' to fully describe it. AC1 allowed you write notes on each item 
that stayed with the item etc. This is a much greater database feature 
than simple colour information.

It would actually be trivial to support full colour dying by simply 
allowing each item to drag along r/g/b colour values. You don't need 
extra textures, nor extra storage, nor a dearth of extra item numbers to 
support it.

Supporting actual dyed armour would take up the same or less amount of 
database space as supporting equipment augs.
