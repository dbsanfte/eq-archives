Yes, Biz, I sure as hell will. I don't know if you subscribe to the UK
internet newsgroups, probably not, but there has been some interesting
replies. One especially useful one from a French guy who has informed
me that AOL France tried the same thing some months ago and were
forced to withdraw the cut off after complaints to the French Trading
Standards body. We have the same kind of consumer rights department
here and I'll be talking to them about it. AOL in the UK use the
advertising slogan 'Join AOL and you can stay online for as long as
you like without having to watch the clock'. I have this printed on my
original joining CD, so I'd like to hear how they will explain their
position given that. I have sent email to AOL and am awaiting a reply.
I'll keep the group updated when I hear what they have to say.

Rest assured I'm the type of person who will *not* be sh*t upon by
large corporations without a fight, and given the AOL France situation
I'd be surprised if the UK Advertising Standards Department and
Trading Standards will be uninterested in this development.

Regards,

B.B.
