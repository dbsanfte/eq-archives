Lightening Strike is a level 34 spell. Not level 28. At 28 your best
DD is Careless Lightening (@105dd). The only AE spell you have at 28
is Tremor, and it is a Point Blank AE spell that does 142dd for 200
mana.

At 28 you have a max med skill of 145.

Not at level 28 as you indicated in your previous post. (The original
poster was referring to his Necros solo ability at level 28) 

If you were using Lightening Strike (which does @172-184dd) on the
Zelniaks, then you had to have been at least level 34. Making most of
the Zels Darkblue-Yellow, not Red cons.
