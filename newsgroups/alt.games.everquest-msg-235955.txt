I did a search and can't find any previoius references on the newsgroup.
Are these "special properties" or the relative run speeds of the various
colors documented anywhere (I have also searced Alakazam and Casters Realm
with no luck, and Lucy does not indicate any difference).
Since I already have Run3, I would like a mount that will move me faster (or
just pay the minimum and dismount if I need to go anywhere).
