 Well to tell you the truth, I don't really like pulling so I could care
less if SKs take over the role. I do it when I have to and have pulled
most mobs in the game (including some that aren't in anymore) but I
wouldn't cry if someone else took over. Things like Ssra are probably
better pulled by a plate class anyway. In most cases pulls aren't split
so FD isn't that needed.
