What makes it odd is that JUST YESTERDAY I was playing EQ.  Now I am 
having the login problem.  I have a DSL connection and everything runs 
fine on it -- except EQ!

Bothersome.

Oh well, time to go install some flooring in my house.  If Verant does 
not want me to play, then I guess I just don't play.

Perhaps next week.  Or next month.  You know, if my current 3-month 
subscription expires and I am unable to log in by then, then I say to 
hell with it.  They have the majority of their resources poured into EQ2 
and EQ1 should be more stable than this by now.
