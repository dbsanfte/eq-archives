Heh. Will you be the kind of neighbour that will buy a BIGGER BBQ when I buy
a new one? And a FASTER lawnmower when I have one? Life isn't all about
needing to impress others with what you got..... A level 12 won't be getting
9,500pp anytime soon. My 41 Bard doesn't have that much and it will take a
long time for her to gather that much money.

Level up to 60, 61 or so and you'll have enough money. Then creat a new
character, level it to 12 and have your 60+ char put 10k in your bank
account. Then buy a horsie.
