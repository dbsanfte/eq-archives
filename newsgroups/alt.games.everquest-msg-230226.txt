2hb is at least reasonably attainable at most levels. Theres the woodsmans
staff, which is still a nice cheap bazaar weapon for the lower levels,
some niceish weapons from cazic thule, and of course the Great Staff
of the Four Winds, which is one of the nicest non raid weapons about
AFAIK. 1hb is a bit rarer, although at the high end the stone etched
mallet and hammer of crashing waves are good, and I believe theres
a LDON weapon worth considering.

Coo ;) It took me *ages* to raise my skills. When I got Emperor 
Ssras sword my 2hs was at about 205 or something. Horrible to
raise ;) I guess its all relative and about how impatient you are
though ;)

get too low ;) *punch punch punch* ohhh! Skillup!

Dont forget to use the magical gloves if you're punching INVULNERABLE
critters though ;)
