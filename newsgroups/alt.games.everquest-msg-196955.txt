Try it now. The new server has dragged lots of people away and you only
ever have trouble at peak times (USA evenings), sometimes atm.

As someone who can play at other times, at times it is impossible to get
a group going. 

Enjoyed a few hours with a lvl 41 warrior and self (lvl 35 bard att) in
the WR/RR one evening in peak time when the new server kicked in. Good
for a level. You can occassionally partner with a higher level looking
for Amstar's Scroll, or someone collecting goblin ears for faction hits.

When the queues were full, I would follow the guard killers and collect
High Keep Flasks. Yes, I know only 9 copper, but occassionally someone
with bad guard faction would have to run and zone and you would make a
5pp+ haul, Also, most take the cash and a lead weapons as well, many of
which a fine steel and another 5pp as well. Made as much pp doing this
whilst waiting for a place on the queue as I have on the best 3 hour run
in the WR/RR. After 3 hours I usually need a break to rest the wrists
from barding.

Another benefit is that I now know almost all of high keep corridors and
the places you can fly to from the top balconies to practise brass
skills.
