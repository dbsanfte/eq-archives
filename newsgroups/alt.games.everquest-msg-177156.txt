This has been covered before, but recent experiences and one of the
current threads on Taunt make me think it bears repeating.

If you are in a group and you draw aggro for whatever reason, and
you're drawing this aggro is a very bad idea (casters, listen up
please), please, for the love of [insert deity of choice], *stand
still*! Do *not* run. Do not try to stun the mob to the point of
forgetting you - he won't. Just shout out to your group, "ON ME!!!",
turn auto-attack off, and then stand there and let the mob beat on you
while the tank(s) regain aggro. If you hit them, they will hate you
more. If you nuke/stun/DoT/debuff them, they will hate you more. If
you run, they will get choice shots at your unprotected behind for
massive damage while at the same time the tank(s) can't effectively
coerce them into turning from you.

Sometimes you die when the stuff hits the fan. Accept that and just do
what you can to minimize those occurrances. Making it as easy as
possible for the tank(s) to get the critters off you is a major step
in that direction.

Two points of exception: if you are of high enough level and facing
appropriate mobs, channelling through with a root or such would be in
order. This really is meant for the under-40-ish crowd. If your group
isn't paying enough attention to come to your aid, then by all means,
run like hell. :)
