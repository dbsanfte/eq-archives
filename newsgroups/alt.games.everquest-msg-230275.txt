Yep, Graeme makes the point elsewhere that the value of this spell is
largely dependent on your level, I should have qualified my comment
accordingly. At my level IoS is still making sense, as it will for you for
some time. When we start making our way into our 60's IoS will beomce a lot
less appealing. So get the full value while you can!
