PoP xp is better in a full group than it was before the patch.
My group yesterday (65 rng, 65 dru, 65 mage, 65 clr, 65 shaman,
65 warrior) pulled in 4 aa in 5 hours in PoV.  This was with
many occasions in between warriors (went through 3) when my pet
would tank, and the ranger wouldn't chain pull during those
times.

The PoP ZEM is still higher than old world zones.  Add in to
that the fact that there is no high con for a level 65 for any
mobs below 60th.  As a result, any single PoV golem is worth
2-4x as much as those old world mobs.
