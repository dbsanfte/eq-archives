Guy is walking thru the park, early in the morning, on his way to work. He
hears a small voice cry for help and looks down to see a frog looking back
at him.
"I was cursed by an evil witch, please kiss me and I'll turn into a
beautiful princess" pleads the frog.
The guy picks up the frog, smiles and then puts it in his pocket. He carries
on walking, the frog pokes his head out of the pocket and says again
"If you kiss me I'll turn into a beautiful princess and I'll stay with you
all week"
The guy looks down at the frog, smiles and pushes it back into his pocket.
The frog climbs out and says again "If you kiss me I'll turn into a
beautiful princes and do ANYTHING you want" but once again the frog is
pushed back into the pocket.
The frog shouts from inside the pocket "Look! Why won't you kiss me" the guy
reaches into his pocket and pulls the frog out and says
"Look, I play EQ, I don't have time for a girlfriend but a talking frog?
that's cool"
