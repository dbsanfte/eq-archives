Fuck you if you're going to get snippy, Tigger. What did you expect from
such a horse's ass statement, if not a little kidding? "You're not
soloing if you have KEI."

/boggle

It's a buff, "jackass". So are ninety million other buffs. You really
want to drag this out to try to salvage a sinking rowboat? Fine. Where
do you draw the line. Which buffs are ok to say you are "soloing" and
which are not? (Like this fucking matters a bit.)
