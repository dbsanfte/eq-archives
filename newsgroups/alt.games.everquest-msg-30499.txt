I can sympathize. I'm currently hunting mammoths (shhh be vewy vewy quiet)
and the competition is fierce. If I see a mammoth not obviously engaged I'll
lob a firebomb at it. If it doesn't then come my way I'll back off and you
can have the 98 point damage assist with my compliments. Mostly on my server
people are pretty good about not KS'ing a mammoth.

BTW you halflings with your little feet flying like cartoons while you run
through the snowbanks are just hilarious to me. :)
