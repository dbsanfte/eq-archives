Woooah!!!

I was looking at around 50k for the cheap version, up to 200k for the
fastest as a high end, 20k - 100k at the low end. I was looking at
horses as a status symbol, rather than as a basic high level
requirement.

15k for the fastest horse means they will have to assume EVERYONE has a
horse, and adjust mob speeds to account for that assumption (:o/

CRs just got a whole deal more painful...
