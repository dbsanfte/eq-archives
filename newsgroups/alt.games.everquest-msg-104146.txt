Listen, I was responding to one post in a specific context.  If you
think by my ONE response above that I find no values in Druids then I
must confess that I think you're an idiot.

Of course, I'm sure you didn't leap to that assumption.  You wouldn't
be so rash and naive.

To set the record straight:  I've yet to find a class that doesn't
provide value in a group.  Yep, even high level druids.  ;-)
However, dr00ds do annoy me.  Thus my initial response (yep, I rose to
the troll bait).

Now then, go find someone else to argue with.
