I'm on Fennin Ro too...  Gee, I've been searching all over for Spilt Paw
Hide Gloves!  I'd love to buy those gloves off you.  Would you take 2pp down
and 1pp/month???  I promises I'll keep playing for the 833 years it will
take to pay them off!!!  :>)

Seriously though, I stay as far form the Bazzar as possible.  When I go to
nexus for an occasional KEI, I'm in and out as fast as possible.  I just
can't deal with the lag.  Even gating back form Nexus can be hell depending
where I'm bound due to increased lag upon returning to bind point.  90% of
the time now I just sell to a vendor.  Since with stines + Cha spells my Cha
is 135 which usually gets me a decent price on more common items form
vendors.  The only time I sell to other players is if I have a fairly rare
or rare item.  Then I'll go somewhere like DL etc... where peeps are likely
to have a little plat to spend and I'll sell it for 1/2 its server price or
a bit less.  I'm not hurting for plat either but I'm not in the market for a
horse.

I think the vendors up there had better start stocking up on high level
Enchanter items pretty soon though.  From what I've seen at the platform in
Nexus, soon the Enchanters will have all the money in EQ!  They probably
won't mind paying 1.5K for a spell worth 2pp though.... hehehehe

Oh how I miss the Tunnel at WC....  /Shout: Shammy at T2 selling all on him
cheap!  :>(
