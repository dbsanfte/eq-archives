Of course :)

The giants in Frontier Mountains can see through camo. One has to
exercise considerable caution, especially during laggy times, when
cruising through there. Being giants, they're generally easy to avoid,
but if they're playing the magic-blinking-game, you can get taken by
surprise.

As for the giants in Kael, I can't say with any authority. I know I
made it way in deep once before either my camo dropped or something
saw through it. I was lucky enough to make it most of the way back to
the zone before being tent-spiked into oblivion.

My *guess* is that there are some giants in Kael that can see through
invis, and so extreme caution is warranted.

>Worry about your camo wearing off. 

Absolutely. Camo is extremely fickle about when it fails, and doesn't
seem to have any concern for the health and well-being of the person
it is cast on.
