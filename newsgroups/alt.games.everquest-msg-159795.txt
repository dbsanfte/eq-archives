Of course they would! Do you think that they don't do extensive
testing as it is? Do you think that any amount of testing they can
possibly reasonably afford would compare with hundreds of thousands of
individuals hammering on it with a myriad of differently-configured

call the Test server. What more can we demand?

A little understanding and patience is in order here.
