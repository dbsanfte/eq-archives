I've just started a halfling thief in Rivervale and have
been desperately searching for some good quests
nearby the city. I've checked out the popular sites
and have had a hard time sorting them out!

Are there any decent quests that a rogue can do
besides just gaining faction and sp???

Any decent weapon or armor quests for a level
5-7 thief?
