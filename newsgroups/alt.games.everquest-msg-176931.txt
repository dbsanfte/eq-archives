The "weak healing" hybrids (Ranger/SK/BL) can do fine with Magician
(summonned bandages + "Persistent rEtargetable doT" aka pet), Necro
(limited additional healing + fear/root/mez + pet), or Enchanter
("Everything's under control" + haste + slow + rune) as a partner.
It's really only Wizard that's hard for a melee/hybrid to work with
efficiently (almost said effectively, but any duo can be effective).
