    The poster I was responding to had claimed the other classes had
balances on their charms so they didn't require nerfs.

    Compare with how fast an enchanter in a place like Fungus Grove could
get XP with a hasted, dual wielding, Dire Charmed Fungusbeast. No risk of
charm break unless you attack the lotus plants and stupidly don't stun, can
pull in XP as fast or faster than the AoE group in the other half of the
caverns which does XP two to three times faster than a normal group. Nobody
complained about that. Now that all AA's are trivial, though (a group that
can't pull one AA per two hours in a PoP zone is slacking), suddenly a 30
minute AA point is wrong?

    Necromancers and druids.
