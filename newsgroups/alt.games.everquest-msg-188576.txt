Combat skills can be trained to any level...You just need to pay for the
privelege and have the practice points available.  If he has not spent the
points, then skill up to about 40 at the trainer and then fight his way to
his current max skill of 75 should be fairly easy.  Try to get a Mino Battle
Axe (about 4pp from players around Kelethin) or if you can find one, a
Langseaxe (sp?) for about 20pp.  The MBA has good damage for a cheap 1hs and
the Langseaxe is fast for a cheap weapon.
