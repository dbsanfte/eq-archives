They've been screwing around with a lot of stuff on Test, including
a new character record format in the database (let the terror begin!).
All sorts of bad and annoying things have happened, I am suspicious
that a couple of the "crashes" have been deliberate but unannounced
server-side patches (some broken things have suddenly become unbroken
after the server came back up, but no client patch was done).  I don't
know what all they're gonna patch in, but as unstable as Test has been
the past week I'd guess the 10 hours is to make sure they have time to
verify that nothing like the deleted character bug (poof! you don't
exist!) makes it through to the production servers.
