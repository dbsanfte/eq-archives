Yes, unfortunately.  Just another way Verant catered to the crybabies
that complain that "it's tooooooo hard to make friends who will bind
you".  

Personally I refuse to use them.  I will adventure with a bit more
risk or spend money to buy a bind before I will use one of these
soulstealers.  Now that any Cleric old enough to grow pubic hair can
Revive you (or whatever thier first spell is) it isnt likely you will
lose any time on most CRs.  Just a little bit of exp.
