You should be able to solo in there - I could at 40 - but I wouldn't
recommend it. Even for your Dalnir Coin - which is down on level 2 from what
I recall, and will largely be cyan mobs to you - I would take a friend. A
couple of those mobs are slight undercons and, again, there are about 5
where your particular mob is, and they will assist him (think he may still
be blue to you).

There are quite a few green mobs that will still attack you (hassles for no
xp), and the mobs are often clustered (in CC it's pretty easy to get a pull
area where you can fear kite even with the AoE fear we have.

If xp is what your after: Your a bard dude! Go outside where you can roam
around. Inside your stuck with fear kiting and, depending on mobs and
layout, charm kiting (no swarm). Buy PoP if you don't have it, and get
yourself to 42 - then by Chant of Disease. Suddenly you have a 3 chant twist
for about 150 if you get Nostrolo's (the only reason for a Bard to be going
into Dalnir at your level IMHO other then supporting friends).

My suggestion for getting to 42 would probably be the Ulthork tree in EW.
Chant/Swarm/Charm kite - you'll love what it does for the xp bard for the
next level or two.

If you insist on soloing there, then
