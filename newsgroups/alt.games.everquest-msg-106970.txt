If you're determined to fight in Kunark, at 28 the Frontier Mountains
is a reasonable place to group.  You didn't say, and I've never played
a Rogue, but I can't recall seeing any Rogues out soloing at that level,
so I assume you wish to group.  I don't know of any mobs in FM who'll
hurt your OT faction.
