This is just what someone told me awhile back (or maybe I read it on a website
somewhere?)-that when, for example, you used illusion Dark Elf to go to Neriak
when you were a Mith Marr worshiping human and made it past 6 guards, only to
have the 7th kill you was because he "saw through" the illision...but the first
6 didn't.  ???
