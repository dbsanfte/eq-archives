True dat.  I remember the pickup Hate raids 3 or 4 years ago, but I
don't think I've ever heard of an open or pickup raid for Ele's. 

Hell, aside from one large exception (eie/da) alliances don't happen
all that often on RN either.  And when multiple guilds were
backflagging ele's it was like an act-of-god to get some cooperation
going between guilds.  It happened some times, but damn...  Faned is
right on this one - RN is not friendly as far as the raiding guilds
go.
