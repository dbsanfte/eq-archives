We had about 25 people in the 51-65 range and that was totally overkill, but
it was fun.

The most important thing is to have a dedicated Mem Blurr duty Enchanter to
follow the dwarf around incase he aggros someone who is KOS to him. Tell
everyone to CON the dwarf and let the people who are KOS follow out of aggro
range behind. Or else you will end up with a dead dwarf or half your force
having to zone.

Adds. Annoying wandering mobs will always aggro someone in the group. It's
usefull to just have a team keeping these at bay, whether rooting them or
killing them (i just rooted/snared them and kept moving and sometimes
killing the adds if they became too many).
