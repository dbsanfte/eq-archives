I can't speak for others, but I have WinXP Pro and Everquest runs fine.  I
have only a single account and I don't run windowed, nor have I tried to run
windowed.  Assuming that you want to run other applications besides the
game, WinXP stands head an shoulders above older versions of the Windows
family, at least in my opinion.

Cheers,
