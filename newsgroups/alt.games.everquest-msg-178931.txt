    That can be really bad if there's limited bards. Key to beating AD is to
hug your bards tightly.

    The biggest reason to stop flag ninjas is you don't want random people
hanging around. One screw-up by someone who shouldn't be there can lead to a
wipe on some mobs.

    Given my guild's issues with others trying to join us in the elemental
planes, I should suggest we run a public Behemoth raid!

    We call all heals. It alerts the other clerics when someone might need
help, and there's other heals folks might want to duck (like HoTs). I can
see your point if you have a lot of clerics, or if your clerics are lazy and
only use Supernal Remedy.

    Our clerics were once called "a bunch of housewives". Not quite
accurate, but close enough! With myself as the notable exception, a very
mild-mannered bunch.

    Psst. Remember those adds you got during the fight? You can kill the
portals that spawn them, too. =)

    Bad Monual, no biscuit! Waiting for instructions can be crucial. In this
case, after you tell Askr to transport a timer starts for his despawn. Had
some moron rushed ahead and said "transport", the whole guild would have had
to rush up to the next level no matter how unprepared they were. There's a
large number of NPCs in PoP where you shouldn't even hail them until the
raid leader says to do so.

    And more killable portals. ;-)

    That's not the only one. There's also a 3000 DD AE. The first time we
went up, we went up as a clump of people. 1500 DD, 3000 DD, all the
lesser-HP people went poof, and the wipeout was on!

    When you res folks in like that, to zerg down the mobs, it is
traditional to shout "FOR THE HIVE! PROTECT THE QUEEN!" as you res folks.

> Confident in this strategy, we begin.

    A long time ago, Quellious had its first Nagafen raid. All the highest
level people on the server turned up to try and slay the dragon. The leader
of the raid, a wizard named Occy, announced the plan he had for killing the
dragon: all the casters would bind in the dungeon, so that if they died they
could re-memorize a direct damage spell and run back to nuke Nagafen down.
That's when Kepler, another high level wizard who had known beforehand what
the plan would be, revealed his opinion of the strategy. He had created a
level one troll named Badplan on a second account, and during the fire giant
part of the raid had run him from Innothule all the way to the prep area for
the Nagafen fight. When Occy called the plan out, Badplan came up to Occy
and thanked Occy for using him.

    I've often wished, when a plan is announced for a given mob, that I had
space on my account for that level 1 troll. ;-)

> Agnarr has an annoying AE that's draining my mana.

    Agnarr has an annoying AE that's only 100 range that drains your mana.
You can stand outside that and CH if you pin him, hint hint. ;-)

    FOR THE HIVE! PROTECT THE QUEEN!

    I wish I had an exciting story about Agnarr, but I don't. We knew about
our one shot at Agnarr (another guild farms him for upgrades) a full spawn
cycle ahead of time, and on the day we were to kill him he was late popping
(so we had everyone from all time zones online). We had just over 100 guild
members online when we finally went up. I think we lagged Agnarr to death.

    Agnarr + Rallos Zek gives access to Earth, Water, Air (assuming all your
other previous flags are in order). Solusek Ro is also required for Fire.

    Bertox is the first big test. Rallos is the second. Good luck, Monual!
