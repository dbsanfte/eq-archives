    I wouldn't do that. At that price, the intended target market is a guild
that needs one person to do MGB HoV. But for almost all of our fights, we do
MGB Kazad's for the extra HPs and mana regen. So it isn't really needed.

    I still have to get my copy. I have the black vial from Nadox, just need
to get the other two parts.

    Atone gives a chance of wiping the hate list, not a certainty. After
Atoning a rooted mob, I always /assist off the mob to see if it's still
trying to get me.

    The mobs in LoY are horrible undercons. They're balanced against people
who are assumed to be twinked out. I remember tanking some greens in Nadox
and noticing they were hitting for 140ish max.

    It does. I have the gloves from VT that cast the 5 point damage shield,
and I noticed even something that small used to make a considerable change
in how much mana I'd use when soloing the Underbulks in FG.

    We had the same problem on Sunday. Lots of people talking war and
Oscars, not a lot of focus on the raid (myself included). After the mob we
were after poofed mid-fight, we just said "F it" and had the rest of the day
off.

    Congrats on the award! Remember what I said a while back, about holding
out for the items you really need? ;-)

    Bah. This male cleric is 32 as well, as of last week. ;-)
