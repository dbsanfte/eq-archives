Ignore it.  It means you effectively regen one less hp per tic, horrors, 
and as you've noted, you'll just get it again next mob.  If the 1hp/tic 
dot is enough to put the kibosh on your soloing attempt... don't hunt the 
fiends.  Try the bugs in the north end of the zone, or a mushroom or two.

But clerics just -love- it when you come crying to them for a cure disease 
once every six minutes and don't even invite them to group. :)
