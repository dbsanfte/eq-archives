Dorf is an insulting term, referring primarily to the NPC dwarves
of butcherblock who are on many a players hunting list for
experience.  Anyone referring to me as a Dorf is either knowingly
or unthinkingly insulting me... if they are doing it on purpose its
usually just to yank my chain.  On the other hand, I have managed
to be insulted by the casual use of the term once or twice... and
its not a good idea to insult the cleric.

Dorf is not, I'll point out, significantly shorter than Dwarf, although
Dorfs is a little better than Dwarves.

Friends and fellow dwarves may call me a Dorf... but strangers
seeking a favor should stick strictly to Dwarf.
============================================
Pally, chanter, shammy, wizzie, are all affectionate diminuatives,
to my knowledge there isn't a similar insult component (thought
I stand ready to be corrected on this)
============================================
Gobs, Legos, and so forth are sometimes critically important
abbreviations; events in EQ can move well faster than the time
it takes to type out full names and complete sentances.  %T is
a massive improvement (although it often creates sentences
like "I'm being chased by a a orc get it off me!")

Further, hunting in a zone for some time, you get over any need
to type out centurian every time you want to discuss some
strategy.

"Rooting cent, lego will pull, snare on arrival so pawn
doesn't add" is a lot handier to type out than "I will cast
root on the orc centurian, the orc legionaire will charge out
after me and I'll run back to you.  Cast your snare on him
once he gets here, not close to the Orc Pawn, at your level
you'll get it to join in too, otherwise."  Sure, the first few times
you are discussing this sort of matter you may want to use
the full names, but eventually shorthand develops naturally,
thats how people are.

Further, as a relatively longwinded typist (could you tell
from my posts?) I actually get into trouble sometimes;
Unlike an actual conversation, noone knows you are typing
until you hit the enter key.  I churn out two or three line
long sentences, only to find someone acting midway thru
my sentence!

It helps if you
break your lines down
and hit enter a lot
but thats really sloppy
and hard to follow

On the other hand sitting around crafting a long and
detailed request full of polite phrases and...

(oops, just noticed the guy I was going to ask for a
sow zoned while I was finishing my sentence.)
