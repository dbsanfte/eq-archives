So far, the only mob I can recall mitigating the slow was the final one 
int he execution trial.  May have been one or two more as well.

As for slow + heal, no, I don't think I am exagerating.  If a mob is 
slowed 75%, he is doing 1/4 of the damage he would do unslowed.  So, if 
he would normally do 2k damage in 10 seconds, now, it averages to 500 
damage in 10 seconds.  Without the slow, you'd have to cast the 4k heal 
every 23ish seconds.  With the slow, I need to cast my 1950 heal once 
every 40 seconds.  Costs me 250 mana to slow, 400 mana to heal 1950hp.  
Costs a druid 600 mana to heal 4680hp.  It does not take very long before 
slow plus shaman gimp ch is superior to druid's best gimp ch.  It will 
all depend on the mobs you go up against, but, if a fight is going to 
last longer than around 30 to 40 seconds, shaman slow + heal is more mana 
efficient than druid heal.  If all the mobs you go up against die very 
fast, then, no, slow is not terribly useful.
