Yes.   High level shamans don't meditate all that much.  (at level 60 with
torpor, not at all.)  Faster for them to cannibalize and regen.   I'm not sure
what level shamans get cannibalize 3... but I think it's higher than what
you're talking about.   And Canni 2 is quested, so he may not have done it.
With only Cannibalize one, it would take a while.
