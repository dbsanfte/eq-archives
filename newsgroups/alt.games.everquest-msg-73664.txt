There are certainly items in the game that don't make sense except for
twinking purposes.  For example, there are items that provide a small
amount of hit points and mana.  I twinked my enchanter with bracers
that provide 10hp / 10mana.  Such items are utterly useless after the
first few levels, but also are certainly unobtainable in the first few
levels without twinking.

I suppose you could say that Verant is simply being sloppy or didn't
think it through, but I prefer the simplest hypothesis: Verant
expected such things to be used, exactly the way players use them.
