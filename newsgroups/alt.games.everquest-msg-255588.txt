Yes, it's quite the boring quest, but what do you want for something
that doesn't require any hunting or even plat for ingredients?  You're
always free to go practice up your tradeskills some other way.  But if
you figure that getting to 54 was going to be boring anyway, well, at
least this is simple enough that you can just do it and get it over
with.  And then you're in Abysmal, where you can find ingredients for
many of the higher-skill recipes as well.

From a practical standpoint, I'm sure they set it up this way so that
even a character with truly minimal INT/WIS can be sure to get enough
skill-ups, and even if he has some bad luck with the random number
generator.  And also from a practical standpoint, I can see why they
made it "turn in a certain number of items" rather than "have a high
enough skill" as the way to trigger the next step.  Even ignoring
whether counting is easier to implement (or might already have been in
place for other quests), if they'd made skill level be the trigger,
then characters with high INT/WIS would be kicking through the series
far too quickly.  The way they arranged it, all characters have to
suffer equal pain if they want to be cheapskates about it.
