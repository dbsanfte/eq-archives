Correction, the faster the gratification, the shorter the gratification 
lasts. Therefore, you wind up doing it all in a couple months time. 
Personally, I like the fact that EQ continues to entertain me after years 
of play.

I do like the faster mana/hp regen when not on a hate list idea. Of 
course you are right about the sitting not being why EQ is great. That's 
the flipside of what makes the game great. You can't have one without the 
other, and they can't be out of balance. The obvious goal it to make 
time+effort = reward+satisfaction for as many people as possible. A lot 
of people demand less downtime without being willing to actually consider 
how it would diminish or devalue the game.
