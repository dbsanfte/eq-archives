tut, tut, tut... you know better than that :o)

To anyone reading this who's not had the pleasure/abject terror of facing a
dispelling caster... load up some throw-away buffs at the top of the list
(Cold Resist, Fire Resist, See Invis, etc) that you won't miss when if a
Dispell lands... MR, SoW, Clarity, Regen, etc all go on last, in the hopes
they'll last long enough to kill the caster
