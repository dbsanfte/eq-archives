Do not ever, ever, ever turn in your POD book.  If you want to play
PvP, play on a PvP server.  On a regular server, players who turn in
their books cannot have spells cast on them by anyone who hasn't
turned in the book (positive or negative spells).  This effectively
makes you a pariah, unable to find a group.  I can't even remember the
last time I saw a character above level 5 with a red name on a
carebear server.

The PvP "switch" was a much-touted idea that turned out to be
unworkable in practice, and which has now been mostly forgotten.
PvPers play on Tallon, Vallon or Rallos Zek.
