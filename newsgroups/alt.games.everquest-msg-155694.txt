True, but I've never really been in such a hurry to cast a pet that
the extra 15% haste is necessary.  I cast pet.  Pet fights for me.
When pet dies, I FD or run and cast another one where/when it's safe.

Sure, the pet doesn't get much out of the deal, but then I doubt he's
very anxious to be summoned up to die that much faster, either :)
