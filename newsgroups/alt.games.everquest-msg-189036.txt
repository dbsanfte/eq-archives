The Graveyard is actually very convenient.  

-You can walk up to the outside windows of the entrance cells and pull
to the GY by just aggroing through the window.
-Someone can watch for Sralm without actually leaving the camp.  
-If you have a lower level in your group, the MOBs dont seem to aggro
as quickly to the GY as they do the exit.
-If you have a sub-56 fighting with you, trains become a big problem
at the zoneout.
-There is lots more room in the GY.  You can kite or root park if
necessary.
