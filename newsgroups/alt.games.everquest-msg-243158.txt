Ahh, good, a much more sensible approach. :)

Indeed so. :) Although the gate potion mentioned further down the thread 
might be a simpler solution if it's actually hard to find help with this.  
Or it might be conceivable to get away with using a Worker's Sledgemallet, 
or one of the cheaper non-instant gates.

Actually...  I'm not completely sure, but I -think- a couple of the NPCs 
in the tower in WL that the zone to PoG is in are on the appropriate 
faction.  That might be a much simpler solution.  Or at least, it would 
give you a heads-up as to whether it might work or not.
