The skulls in question drop off mobs in a weird little underground maze that as
far as I know can only be reached from underwater, and there are no ladders in
there.  I'd be delighted to find differently... but I doubt that your
suggestions are actually focussed on my problem.  I can get out of the water
even right above the underwater entrance to the area I need to get to; in fact,
I can sit there fully visible, summon pet, kill wandering rodentlike animals,
all under the not too watchful eye of the local crusaders.   But I can't get
down the tunnel with the pygmy baraccudas and up any of the shafts to where the
mosquitos, scorpions, decaying skeletons, swamp leeches, and rarer Giant Swamp
Leech and Iksar Outcasts spawn (the latter being the mob that I need)  Going
over to the necro guild to climb out of the water would be like looking for a
lost quarter under the street lamp, because the light is better over there.

He died like a level one pet with no HP buff at all.. which is to say a -lot-
faster than me as a level 3 chanter with nearly 300 hp.

Possibly so, but the bard vendor was still there!   I asked about it in OOC and
nobody fessed up, although if someone did train him to zone they wouldn't be
about to answer  such questions even if so inclined.

Dying wasn't really a risk, it was just the interminably long wait to get HP
back that bugged me.  No enhanced speed, but I can certainly start using sow
potions or hiring out a SOE (thats long duration SOW with lev, right?), less
mana efficiency would be ok, medding back a bar of mana is a lot better than
regenning back a bar of HP.  Root nuke is the way my cleric was forced to
operate, and thats a bit of a loser's game, since roots tend to break when you
root.  Only game in town for a cleric (or it was back then, before they added in
the lower level undead dots)

I'm deliriously familiar with the basics of charm kiting from my bard, I must
say chanters seem far less well suited to the task, unable to enhance their own
speed, snare mobs, or cast while moving, it looks to me like a recipe for
extreme pain.  I can see, though, where Hide would be handy for the purpose.
