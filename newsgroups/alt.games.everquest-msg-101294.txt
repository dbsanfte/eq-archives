I play at 1280x1024, clip plane full out, all models on, with animations,
etc, etc.

PIII-800
768MB memory (PC-133)
GeForce2 MX2-400 64MB (Not DDR, it's a cheap one)
Crappy sound on board
Via chipset
512K up/down internet connection

It becomes really bad in Shar Vahl, and pretty bad in Shadowhaven.  In raids
I seriously reduce the settings.  For everday play in zones other than
cities on Luclin, it works great, Luclin zones in general are not as good as
Norrath zones.

I may have a GeForce3 coming soon, a friend is upgrading to a 4.
