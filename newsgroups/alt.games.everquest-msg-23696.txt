Well...  Lets see...

Answer # 1.

Fun, Friendship and Fun are the most important things...  Did I mention Fun?

I look for a guild with people of all levels and classes who are willing to
help their fellow guild members by offering the skills that they have to
offer...  ie:

- Enchanter... Breeze/Clarity whenever nearby,
- Cleric... Heal, Ressurection, Cure Disease whenever possible,
- Druid... SoW, teleport whenever possible...
- Jewelers and smiths... willing to offer product for free (if materials
provided) or cost to fellow guildmembers...

Also, a willingness to help a guildmember with quests and obtaining specific
quest items if needed and if possible.

These things are all relative...  I dont expect a guildmate to run half way
accross the world to port me or cure my rabies...  I dont expect to be given
awesome equipment and gear for nothing... But if I loot a great +INT item...
I'll donate it to a caster in my guild. Also if a guildie gets his/her hands
on a great +WIS item, I would expect them to do the same for me.

But like I said...  Its all relative.  HELPING a guildmate get a port is
just as good as giving him a port...  IMHO

The guild I am in is fairly young and rapidly growing.  We have only a few
high level characters and are missing a high level Jeweler and Smith...  But
its coming.

Without my guild I wouldnt have half of the gear I have now.

And it is fun.  :)  My previous character was in a different guild...  And
they were not as helpful or fun.  So I quit...  I'm quite happy with the
guild I found...  Or should I say the guild that found me...

On to question number 2.

Answer # 2.

Definately a discreet TELL to non guilded members or to someone you wish to
convert.  /ooc is disabled on my screen...  And shouts are obnoxious  and I
tend to ignore them...

Answer # 3.

People that get along and help each other...  Fun and friendship are what EQ
is all about IMHO...  When its not fun anymore my account gets canceled...

I would like to see a guild that has a good spread of everything...  Druids
for ports and SoW, Clerics for Rezes, Enchanters for breeze/clarity, tanks
types (Monks, warriors, SK's) for muscle...  a bit of everything.  Just like
you would want in a good group.

Obviously this is hard to find in a young guild.  But growth is important
to.  So the potential for these things is every bit as important.

Not too many people though...  But enough...  lol

Answer # 4.

Answer # 5.
