Twinking a wizard?

T-Boots and a dragoon dirk for the lower "I have to melee
some" levels.

That's it.  That's all you need.

Root/nuke is ok...but when you have T-Boots you can
just nuke kite all day with absolutely zero chance of
dying due to game play (this doesn't include lag or
LD or server crashes...you can't help that).

Sure, you may not have the mana pool to quad kite
all day long, but a wizard can perfectly well take out
critters all the way to 60 running around naked with
T-Boot speed on.

Good luck!
