death pact is a gamble . .


at the moment of death, there is a chance that the spell will kick in and
give 1000hp

the chance of this is allegedly based on their charisma (not the cleric's
charisma)


i have heard of few cases where it has worked, and of those it seems to be
mostly casters, but then it would seem that a caster would have a greater
chance to have this spell cast upon them (than a melee), as they die
quickest

in all the months my regular (and raid) groups' clerics have been 51+, i
have never seen this spell cast


thus i'm only moderately certain, because this (above) is all what i'm told,
but i've never heard it otherwise
