Searchin' For Celine
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

( - A. Lanier - )

I've been searching searching
Searching for Celine
I've been searching searching
Searching for Celine

I know where she's working
I know where she hides
I know why she's cursing
She knows why I lie

I've been searching searching
Searching for Celine
I've been searching searching
For her company

I know where she's sleeping
I know why she's tired
I know why she's cursing
She knows why I lie

Love is like a gun
In the hands of someone like you
I think it'd kill
But oh what a thrill
Oh what a thrill

I've been talking talking
Talking in my sleep
I've been talking talking
Talking to Celine

Talking 'bout your love
Talking 'bout your love
Talking 'bout your love
Do you know what I said
