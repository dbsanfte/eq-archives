While I've seen people mention some kind of "cleric gets all the
gems" plan here in the newsgroup, I can tell you that I've never
seen it implemented on either Luclin (cleric to 49 before I "quit EQ")
or Morell Thule (59 cleric)

Not only have I not seen it, it makes no sense.  Peridot are a
substantial expense...when you are 44 and just got that first
peridot symbol.  By your 50s, if you are twitching over some
10pp gems you are doing something wrong.

Most groups -do- make a point of asking how many 'dots used,
and cutting the cleric a refund before splitting cash.. this isnt really

necessary but its a nice gesture.

100 pp out a split that is going to total 500pp times six people
(3000pp for the math challenged) isn't going to amount to much,
and its unlikely that a cleric is going to go thru even 10 peridot in
an evening with a single group in Seb.
