Yes, this is sad indeed.  I was reading news on-line last night and saw a
headline about the Who beginning an American tour, yada-yada...I was
thinking how cool it was that the surviving members were slogging it out
again.  When I clicked <back> to read more headlines, the one I was reading
had been replaced with "Who bass player dead at 57".
So then it was off to Kazaa-land, downloading and listening to the Who for
the rest of the evening.

RIP, John Entwhistle.  You are one of my main inspirations for taking up
bass guitar so many years ago.

SEAN...

(Lord, *please* don't touch Black Sabbath.  In fact give Ozzy dragon life!)
