So, you missed most of the game since it really starts after you gain your 
citizenship at level 7 and start to explore the world. There's very little 
to explore on the Isle of Refuge from levels 1-6 and once you hit town and 
gain level 7 as a citizen you are just beginning to learn how to nagivate 
the many zones of the city of Qeynos. I'm not sure how you could conclude 
that there was no sense of adventure if you didn't spend any time in the 
world intended to present that adventure. But as always, this game isn't 
going to be for everyone and if it didn't grab you at the start, it probably 
isn't going to grab you later, either. You might want to consider WoW, which 
does a much better job I think of grabbing you initially (although your 
complaint about sameness will multiply in spades there).

> It's look and feel, play-wise, was so similar to CoH

Could you explain this comment? I have no idea how anyone could come to this 
conclusion, but I'm interested to hear your thoughts on it. I liked CoH 
quite a bit and I like this game a lot, so maybe there's something to what 
you say. On the other hand, my wife liked CoH a lot and doesn't like this 
game. What exactly is there about EQ2 that you find similar to CoH?

As good as the character creation is in this game it's definitely not up to 
CoH's standards (nothing is), but since you quit shortly after getting to 
town you were still wearing your noob armor and you probably looked similar 
to other noobs who were doing the same quests. Wait till you hit level 10 or 
so and start to differentiate a bit. Honestly, of all the complaints I have 
about this game, this isn't one of them.
