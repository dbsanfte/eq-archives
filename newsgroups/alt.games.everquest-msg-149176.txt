At higher levels, clerics are now a significant melee damage output source,
and don't regen mana all that much faster sitting down.  Thus a 56+ cleric
who is sitting on his butt is probably slowing things down... its situational,
though, there are cases mana is so tight that the extra 10 per tic you'd get
sitting outweighs the 30 DPS plus stun/bash interrupts.

At lower levels, a cleric can stun, root, root/atone, and thats not counting
special tactics like Fearing... while clerics that don't concentrate on
healing and keeping mana up for healing are the worst, clerics that think
all they can do is sit and heal are not much better, throwing away half
the capabilities of the class.

Insist on a Master Looter "ML", a designated person who loots every
body, then splits up the loot whenever group composition changes.
Loot split should consist of

1) reimburse cleric for symbols
2) split remaining cash equally
3) if selling junk wasn't possible, offer to split junk (often this goes to the ML
cause people don't want to bother)
4) divvy up good drop loot by some fair measure, preferably agreed on before
camp started, and restated to each new member if group changes

Using this method you  WILL get cheated occaisionally by ML's who
don't report everything (how would you know?) or log out before
splitting... but then you will learn who to trust, and in the long run
its still a lot better than not getting any loot ever; most of the time
the ML plan results in you getting a more or less fair share.
