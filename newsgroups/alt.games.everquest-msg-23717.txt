I've found pulling as a cleric great fun and I've gotten very good at it. It
is a thrill to have all of my group jaw's on the floor when I can pull
faster and more accurate than the warrior. I think clerics can be great
pullers if you know what to do. We have several tools to pull one at a time,
root, or stun if things get out of hand. And if you really mess up you can
cast divine aura and run back to the group taking no damage. Of course most
will gripe at you saying they want there cleric sitting at all times FOM,
but hey, as long as your smart and you're doing your job correctly with no
deaths, why stare at a book all your life.
