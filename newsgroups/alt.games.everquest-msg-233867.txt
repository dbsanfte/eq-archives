First, Instill Doubt has quite a "learning hump" to it. Getting it over
50 takes *forever*, but once it's over that, the skill increases start
coming much faster. So you might want to consider just dumping a lot of
training points into it to get it primed.

Second, you can get skill ups in Instill Doubt even if your target is not
in melee range. When my rogue and bard got Instill Doubt, whenever they'd
zone, I'd pick some mob close by (a guard, a giant rat, whatever), target
it, and start Instilling Doubt on it while going about my normal business.
If you get the message "you're not scaring anybody", then you failed. If
you get the out of range message, then you would have succeeded if only
you'd been in range. But you can get skill ups either way. The advantage
of doing this is that you can get skill ups while running across zones,
waiting for nexus spires to fire, waiting for ships, etc.

[ObStory: I once got a guy killed this way. I'd targetted the guards in
the NK guard tower while standing by the nexus scion, and was practicing
instill doubt. Some monk came by, thought it was a cool idea, and started
practicing ID too. As I was typing a tell to him with a suggestion to not
have the nexus scion targetted, his ID fired agroing the scion, and she
one-punched him for 2000hps damage. The nexus spires go off immediately
after, I'm in nexus and he's at his bind point in Overthere. We both
laughed, and I sat chatting with him while he made his long corpse run
back to the NK spires. After about 20mins of hoofing it through the Karanas,
he made it back to NK, started looting his corpse, and (you guessed it)
the NK spires fired and he found himself in nexus with half his gear still
on his corpse. We were both rolling on the ground from that one.]
