Most importantly you'll need a drum. Not so much early on, but once
you're able to kite that's pretty much all you'll be using until your
epic (unless the group perfers your melee dps, or you're like me and
can't help but whack things :P). With only 1,500 I'd go for a walrus
skin drum, nothing fancy, but a decent enough mod for ~300p. Once you
get 3-5k go for a TDoK, very good deal, best drum until elementals. As
for armor, just get anything you can with good dex, cha, agi and
sta/hp. Int also help later on, but not until around 64. You should be
able to get a whole set of Mystic Koada`Dal Mithril for around 2k, not
sure how the prices have changed, it's been a while, but it's a good
set for starting out.

As for spells, these are the basic set ups, it will change a bit
depending on the situation, but heres some outlines:

Group:
selos
lull
mezz
haste song 1
stat song 1
stat song 2
resist song
regen

of course that will change depending on your level and songs, but
you'll pretty much want selos for traveling, lull for pulling, mezz for
CC, and the rest to pick from to twist. Haste and regen are your most
important, resist is really dependent on where you're fighting, I
usually only use it on raids. Then just pick a stat song or two,
depending if you want to twist 3 or 4.

Chant kiting:
Selos
lull
mezz
regen (may perfer snare earlier on)
chant 1
chant 2
chant 3
chant 4

This should be pretty obvious. Keep selos up, pull a single, lull if
needed, then keep 3-4 dots on. You need to be I think... 42 to do this
with 4 chants, but you can earlier with 3, or even in your teens (?)
with 2.

Charm kiting:
selos
lull
regen
invis
chant 1
chant 2
chant 3
chant 4

Should work with your first charm. Just charm one, have it attack
another, recharm as needed. I was killing reds in DPS with this for
about a level every ~30 min in my 30s :P.

Swarming:
selos
mezz
regen (Or song of dawn is the mobs get frisky)
invis
chant 1
chant 2
chant 3
chant 4

I'm not sure if this works with your first charm, I never tried it but
probably not due to your low cha and low wind. It'll just brake to
fast. The 39 (?) one can work, but it will be hard without your 1 min
selos. The 64 one works the a charm (pun intended).

Raids:
Resist 1
Resist 2
Resist 3
Regen
Haste 1
Stat 1 (Rizlona's)
Stat 2
Mezz

Resists will change depending on where you're killing. But either have
EC or PC, veeshens and GR up if possible. CoM is the best regen you
get, use it. Haste and rizlona's will make your group love you. The
other stat may be AC or CHA if you're with the MA, or whatever to help
DPS if not.
