They are foraged, so only a select group of people can get the stuff
whatever happens. A high level wiz cant obtain it by going killing things,
only by buying it. THat limited source drives the price up....the zones it
foraged in arent the commonest places to lurk for the people of the right
level to be considering using it which again drives the prices up.

Its for cultural smithing and I think a few other high end tradeskill
recipes now.

As you have found as a relatively rare forage its a long time to get a few
stacksa nd high end people want to spend their time better and low
levellers arent likely to want to sit on their butts clicking either....
