I would have to say it depends on the purpose of the raid ( ie are they
looking for a specific item ).

It has been my experience that raids take on several levels ( excluding
plane and dragon raids ... where everyone is of a high level ).  You get
your high level guys that are probably camping for something specific.
As an example, lets use Mistmoore as an example.  We had a raid there
where that ranged from level 20 - 50.  We had several 20ish groups in
the courtyard and graveyard.  Some higher ups in the castle, and the
really high guys camping the soulfire hilt.

On a well organized raid, everyone keeps their assigned area clean ( of
which they are an appropriate level to do so ), and if there are a few
higher levels around to babysit just in case ... all the better.  A raid
like that will get good exp for everyone, and at the end of the night
the good loot can be distributed via whatever guild rules you happen to
have.

I remember one time Arcane Dominion ( on Bertox ) had Mistmoore clean up
to Majong ( or whatever his name is ).  They did this to allow newbies
to walk around.
