Character description files, height, hair type, beard type, skin colour,
things like that.  That's how the pre-order character designer program
allowed people to pre-design their characters.

Alas, alack, all the other information's stored server-side (untrusting folk
that they are; we'd NEVER give ourselves instant L50 and rubicite armour,
would we?).
