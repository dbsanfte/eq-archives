Hopefully the death of these big companies will open the market to the
small 4 man teams. They won't have the resources to make their games
look great so they will have to make the game fun instead. So no more
short unreplayable games that are only fun until the awe at the graphics
wears off. If there are no developers blowing all their money on trying
to make their game look the best people will stop having to upgrade
their 3d cards and hopefully the 3d card market will die too.

It's pathetic that games are praised for having great graphics. Gamers
should thank their video cards for that not developers. Gamers are now
buying the same boring games over and over and the only reason they
think they're playing anything new is because of the hardware upgrade
they made in between.
