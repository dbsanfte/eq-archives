But they were going to sit down for ten minutes no matter when they
got there.  If Scale gets them there five minutes sooner, that's still
five minutes saved on being ready to do whatever they're doing.  Really
the only time lost is the time to cast a different run buff at the
destination, if one is needed and available.

But yeah, it still has to be quite a run for the difference to matter.
It's what, 70% over base instead of 55%?  So if you were going to spend
20 minutes running you might shave almost 2 minutes off it?  Whee.  As
I said, I could have imagined people using Scale on Combine, where travel
between places really can take a long time.  And similarly, I can see how
it might've been a more useful spell in pre-PoK EQ, when travel took
longer, and especially where shaving a smidgeon off your travel time might
save you from having to wait for the next boat, Nexus transport, etc.

Oh, and I think the Earring of Twisted Leaves is DRU/SHM only.
