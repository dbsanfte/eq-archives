I have the Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl.

MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP
Slot: SHOULDERS
AC: 8
STA: +8 CHA: +8 WIS: +8 INT: +8 HP: +50 MANA: +50
SV FIRE: +8 SV DISEASE: +8 SV COLD: +8 SV MAGIC: +8 SV POISON: +8
Effect: Flowing Thought III (Worn)
Focus: Zephyr of Brell
WT: 2.0 Size: SMALL
Class: ALL
Race: ALL
Slot 1, Type 7

My stamina is maxxed self buffed, my wisdom is maxxed when I want it to 
be, so, basically, I'd gain 15hp, 15mana, 2PR, and 2CR, and lose 8 on 
other saves, and much more importantly, FT3 and 20% buff extension, so, 
really, no chance I'd wear that instead.

We do go in and kill the protos off and on, to get upgrades for others in 
the guild though, and I have seen that drop, as well as several of the 
enchanter hate reduction daggers, and a few other nifty trinkets.
