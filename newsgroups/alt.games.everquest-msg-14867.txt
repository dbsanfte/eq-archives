}South Karana? I don't recall ever seeing spiders there. Perhaps you mean East

From what I hear, Guk spiders is regularly camped these days, and EK is a 
madhouse of KSing... Seems everybody wants to be a tailor now that the 
shawl quests are out...

Best tip I got was to try WC or the Ro deserts.  They drop a moderate 
amount of silk, and nobody's fighting over them.
