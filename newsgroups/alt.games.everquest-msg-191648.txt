I know what you mean.  I played this game on/off since beta and I recall in
Qeynos hills, just the trip to Blackburrow was enough to make you fear for
your live.  Those pesky bears, and the all dreaded rabid grizzly.  Heaven
forbid if you were unfortunate enough to kill a bear when Holly was in the
area.

I went to Qeynos the other day in fact and only 1 person was in the zone
killing beetles.  My old friend Flippy Darkpaw came running down the path
and I waxed him just for old time sake.  I entered the city and headed to
the bank, once again I was the only person in the zone (on a Sunday
afternoon!)  I was amazed how empty the city was... maybe a little sad too.

My first character was a barbarian warrior started in 99' iirc (he is still
active, though only lvl 20) the trip from Halos to Qeynos was the scariest
thing ever at the time.  Now with all the maps, and guides and cartography
system, it makes travel much less a mystery.  Though, I sure love the new
features.

I agree w/you in that this game is very unique, but I think the Ultima
Online will go down as the pioneer for bring the persistent graphical world
together for thousands (I was in that beta too... what days!)
