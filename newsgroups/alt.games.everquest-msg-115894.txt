You're exactly getting my point.  If you want the Reavers, and this group 
is farming, you can always PNP 'em.  Not always the best solution, but 
effective, and the Verant approved method.
I know that when someone moved 4 characters into Kedge full-time to 
monopolize the Phinny spawn, the first time he didn't agree to share he 
was PNP'd and vilified on the server forums.  He now farms HS, and is much 
more willing to share if others are there.  The reputations of 4 
characters turned out to be worth a bit more than a few sellable MQs.  (I 
had a very good idea how it would turn out when the first complaint 
mentioned the guild he was in, and the first response was from the 
guildleader explaining that all 4 characters were 'voluntarily' removed.)
