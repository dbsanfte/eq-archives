A friend of mine is having trouble finding a good spot to work
up to 55 as a magician.

Giants in BW: mostly green
Karnors: Did 5 levels there, doesn't want to go back
Spirocs: mostly green, Proven spawn rate too low
Raptors: bite to hard (or was it too many hp?) Druid prey
Cobalt Scar: hasn't tried, but suspects mostly green
Kael Drakkar: too many mobs at a time
Seb: need cleric and chanter he said, suppose that means
        too many mobs at a time again.

As the oracle at the side of the bridge has been eliminated
in EW, I'm not swimming with ideas.

Anyone know some decent spots where he can single pull
mobs that will be blue to him but not devastating, say in the
45 to 50 range?  This was precisely the range of that
Oracle, who was on a 6 minute spawn.

Being a mage of course he'd like something he can solo,
being a cleric I'd like something plentiful enought that
when I'm along he can kill 5 times as many an hour and
still not deplete the spawn pool.
