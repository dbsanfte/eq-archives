Walk to the man in the black coat standing at the bar.
Type "PLEASE MOVE YOUR MOTORCYCLES".
Now they are going to try make to you sleep a little harder than you
usually do (i.e. never waking up). When you feel trapped use, the night
stick, which you activate by pressing F10.
After the gang has left the room, the girl in the bar will address
you. Type "TALK TO THE GIRL".
"DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT DRUGS?
Remember what she said. Start patrolling again.

Now you are in the wrong "Quest" group. But we'll forgive you :)
