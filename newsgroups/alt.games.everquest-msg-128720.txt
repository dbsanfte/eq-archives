Do Needlites run?  The reason I ask is I'm PL'ing a 2nd account
cleric with my 55 mage - and I ran out of easy kills in paludal
(1 yellow short of 26 atm).  The thing is, it's very hard for him
to kill a runner, short of rooting it of course, which uses up
mana I'd rather use for healing.

Basic technique - buff up (900+ hp, 520ish ac atm, defense
lagged the last 2 levels as I was grouped) Shield of Lava
(25pt) and - strike to pull, melee until dead.

At any rate - thanks for the tip on the needlites - I really want
to get him to 37 as quick as possible ( so he can group with my
mage and get massive XP :)
