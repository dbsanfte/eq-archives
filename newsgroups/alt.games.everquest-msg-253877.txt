Have you been recently? I took a 10-11k shadowknight (time gear,
so little god mods) and the cleric was able to keep her up pretty
much solo. I was playing my druid, so I just patch healed. The
only problem we really had was the Kyv Heartstriker stunned
the SK at the end, so she lost aggro and he ate the cleric. 

Unfortunate as she was our only rezzer and needed the flag ;(

Everyone else survived though. We charmed a pooka towards the
end for the named, but otherwise it was largely pure-group
rather than pet based.

Pet is really asking for trouble. The trial is doable without it, but
slower - pet breaks when you've got adds and roamers and repops is
bad news

Well, that much is true, in that you have to be alert to keeping your
CC and rezzers alive and they die like >that<, but I'm surprised you're
having such a tough time. Have you considered the problem may not be
your 10k 1900ac tank friend, but rather the healer you're using?

Yeah ;) Its fun as hell, but put it this way - while we're in a time
guild we're flagging ornate equipped twinks using knight mains to tank
for KT, and not failing.
