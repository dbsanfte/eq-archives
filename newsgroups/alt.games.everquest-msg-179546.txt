Get over yourself. This is what people do when they're being harassed
for no reason. What people do when they're being held accountable for
the exact same thing someone else is doing, while the other person is
being completely ignored. This is what people do when they're faced
with egotistical hypocrites. They reduce the maturity of their
argument to the level of those they're arguing with in desperate hope
of getting something through thick skulls.
