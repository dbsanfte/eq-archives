 This is what you call a pre-emptive nerf. Presently, not many
characters have over 7500HP, so this wont be noticed that much. However,
for those who are focused on the future, it's plainly obvious. There
really should be an outcry on this as there is on the other changes,
since come 6 months into PoP you're going to have quite a few tanks with
more than 7500 HP (plus buffer). Verant just squelched the bitching on
this nerf by doing it early.

 Exactly the response Verant was hoping for: "CH capped at 7500HP? Big
deal, none of our tanks have 7500 HP. Nerf Monks! Rock on Verant!"
