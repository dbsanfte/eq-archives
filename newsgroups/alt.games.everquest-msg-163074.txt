I know of at least one person who kites them around the island - neither
druid or wizard, don't want to get too specific, but one you usually don't
associate with kiting.  This person likes to break off several and kite them
around the island and it takes several circuits to kill them.  I suggested
that this wasn't fair to the other people on the island, but I guess the xps
are too good for him to pass up.
