My feelings on the matter are:

1.  You had the spawn all to yourself for several hours, which is
more than anyone else had.  Even if you didn't get lucky during
that time, you still had your chance for quite some time and
can't complain.

2.  The time you spent waiting there doesn't entitle you to
yet MORE time with it all to yourself to the exclusion of all
other players.  If anything, it means that you've had your
chance and others ought to have a turn at it.

3.  Thus, if I'm at a long camp and someone comes along asking
to join in, I make room for them.  They have just as much right
to that spot in the game as I do.

4.  HOWEVER, basic decency and politeness dictate that if someone
is camping a spot for a painfully long time, you should leave
them to it and try again later.  This is what I always do when
I find a spawn camped, because I know just how much it would
suck if I were the camper and after waiting god-knows-how-many
hours for something, it finally arrived and went to someone
who had just breezed in five minutes ago.

In 50 levels, I have NEVER tried to horn in on an ongoing camp,
EXCEPT for one time when there were very special circumstances.
Back during the Najena GM event, which ran for one weekend,
Rubicite, a cool armor that had not dropped for a very long
time on any server was made to drop for that weekend only
in Najena.  So tons of people flocked to Najena to have a shot
at getting a piece of this rare armor before the GM event
ended and it again became impossible to acquire.

However, every spawn that had a chance to drop Rubicite had
been perma-camped by greedy individuals, who had sat on those
spawns for well over 24 hours and had no intention of stopping.
I took up residence in the room next door and let one group
know I was in line to step in whenever they were ready to
head out.

Eight hours later...  I finally stepped up to the door in
the room and pointed out that since this was a limited time
event, perhaps it would make sense for them to head back
to town and let some other folks have a little chance
to participate in the special event.

Nope, they weren't budging.  And they got pretty testy
about my suggestion that maybe they were being a bit
selfish by trying to have the spawn for the WHOLE EVENT.
The other folks waiting outside the room with me were getting
pretty steamed themselves at having to wait while the
clock was running out, and if it had been a RL gathering,
a riot would have ensued and the tar and feathers would
have been brought out.

Nonetheless, they stayed put, and one even had the
immaturity to /emote "...pisses in the corner" and then
say "MY territory..."

Sigh.

But other than in unusual limited-time circumstances like
that, I always leave a camper to his camp -- there's always
later.  But also, I don't begrudge anyone wanting to
join in at a spot I'm camping.
