If you get the Shadows of Luclin expansion you get a whole set of new 
character models that are a lot more fancy than the old ones you got. 
Also the zones in the expansions are a lot more detailed. You're playing 
an old game if you just have the basic cd, get expansions (esp. Luclin 
and probably Planes of Power which will be released at the end of this 
month) to get the new fancy stuff.
