If you are looking for a "gaming laptop" be prepared to pay a premium
for it, AND be prepared to sac battery life, which is what all entry
level models are optimized for and most performance models too.

A good place to start looking at gaming laptops is Alienware. I don't
endorse them in particular... but they've got the right idea. They use
high rpm hard drives, the latest graphics chipsets, cpus that aren't
speed crippled to save juice and heat, etc. In otherwords the systems
they put together are desktops in a portable laptop form-factor and
intended to be solid gaming platforms. So the gaming experience is
pretty good. But you *will* pay extra for it.

Dude, you won't be getting a Dell. 
(they're cheap junk anyways :)
