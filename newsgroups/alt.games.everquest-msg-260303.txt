Ugh, it wasn't my intent to rain on the WoW parade, I'm just as disappointed 
as others and I'm really only commenting on one aspect of the game. It might 
be showstopper, but it might not. My wife and I are going to play together 
as a duo and we haven't yet decided between WoW and some other MMOG, but 
some of the dynamics that I witnessed in the stress test might not present 
the same problem for a duo that spends most of its time alone.
