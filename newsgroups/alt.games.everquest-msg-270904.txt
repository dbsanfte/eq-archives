You know what you should check out Jim? Mages can summon some girdle I 
think it is that has 500 HP and great stats too. It's norent so it's 
only good for that play session but I think you can often find a mage 
toon in the bazaar selling them along with pet toys, etc. And I think 
they usually run around 5 or 10p for one. The nice thing about these is 
they are not going to run out like temp during your playtime. Of course, 
even better would be to grab one of these and then get a temp too. Uber! 
Hehe...

One catch though, I can't remember what classes can wear the thing. So 
you'll need to check for that. It might be Girdle of Magikot or 
something like that. Maybe somebody else here can clarify what I am 
talking about as I can't remember for sure myself.
