Hmm, I was insuficiently clear.  I chose Phillip/Horselover because,
iirc, Phillip _means_ Horselover.  I see no significant difference
between Horselover and Likespotatos.  I'd prefer to ignore the crack
about "masturbating in text mode", but it's too damned funny so I'll
settle for pretending to ignore it.
 
Oh, and that's Pervect to you bubba!
