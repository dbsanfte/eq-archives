Hey there!

I am lvl 53 necro looking for my pet spell "Minion of Shadows".  Casters's
Realm says it drops in skyfire, but I've been killing stuff there with my
druid and this necro for 10 levels and haven't seen it yet.

Then I heard that it can be obtained in Overthere by a) vendor and b) quest.

Can anyone help me?

Thank you in advance
