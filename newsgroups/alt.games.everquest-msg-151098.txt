[snip whine]

Again: 'and they say druids whine?'

Why do clerics feel SO intimidated when some other classes get a heal
which isn't less mana efficient than their Remedy, especially after
they've become even more the masters of superfast heals, group heals,
and heal over time than they already were? After I saw clerics
complain about how Ethereal Remedy sucked because it had so low mana
efficiency, when even THAT was better than what druids and shamans had
(disregarding Torpor)?

Levels 50-59? The spells are level 58.
