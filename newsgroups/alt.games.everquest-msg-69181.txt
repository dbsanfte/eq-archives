But imho, your think in the wrong way.

You see bind as the place you repop when you died.
BUT this is the side effect !
Bind works with gate, Gate is the only escape way for a caster to leave a
place he cant cross safely.
A caster can be killed by 5 lvl 15 mobs at 50+ only cause they can bash and
interrupt him and he have not enought hp to tanks em.
In this situation, any melle could start the slashing machine and get rid of
the train before loosing a hp bulb.

Gate is a caster ability, bind is linked to gate, this is why casters can
bind
themself (almost) everywhere.
Casters are the main bind users. They must be able to choose their bind
location because they use gate.

For a melee, the bind location is not a choice, you dont plane to die and
respawn at a particular place. Melee dont gate, they die and respawn to
their
bind location. Casters can go to their bindpoint with gate, because they
chose it. The
fact they respawn also there when they die, is a side effet.

This is a gameplay balance before everything.

Lot of casters are bored to play melee because they cant bind themeselves
everywhere.
Lot of melee are bored to play casters because they are too vunerable to
stupid oom death while meding in the spellbook.
Those who want more power, melle and caster abilities, will have the both
restrictions : book, and city bind only. That is fair. No ?
