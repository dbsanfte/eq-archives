I've gotten many a "a Xxxx Giant is stunned" message.  Unfortunately,
except for the Forest Giants, I've never seen any giant in EQ hesitate
even a tenth of a second when allegedly stunned.  It's pretty darned
obvious when the Giant you've supposedly stunned for 3 seconds instantly
takes three steps and bashes and double hits you that the message is
<not> in sync with (virtual) reality.  Stuns still get plenty of hate
tho, and they're quick casting, used to use Stun all the time to keep
the giants more interested in me than the casters.
