No.  Giving magician pets helps in a *few* situations:

A) Your level 34 pets might not dual wield unless you give them two weapons.
B) The weapon has resists or a spell proc.
C) The weapon has a higher damage than the pet's natural damage (delay has
*zero* effect, higher or lower).

Test it.  *I* think it does.  Some people disagree.  Also, this adds a "D)"
to above, as giving a pet two summoned daggers and *then* giving it the
elemental defender will make it use the shield in the back slot rather than
as a shield.  Again, this is what *I* think, and what a lot of others think,
but not everyone agrees.  Verant, as usual, just laughs.
