I wonder what will happen to the old hot spot zones:

- Hate's Fury (55th to 60th level)
- The Crypt of Nadox (50th to 55th level)
- The Torgiran Mines (45th to 50th level)

They were deserted when being hotspots,I bet if they
disable Hate's Fury,no one would notice it.I spent
48 to 56 in Nadox,when not doing Ldon,never ever
did I see a group heading to Hate's Fury in this time.
