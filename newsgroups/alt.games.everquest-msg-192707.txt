Well, my guild has been trying and trying Rallos Zek the Warlord for some
weeks now.  It took us a while to get our strategy down, but now we can get
through Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek without a problem.  Fake Rallos Zek is
also no problem provided we deal with the adds correctly.

What's kicking our butt is the real RZtW.  After fake RZ, we evac to
zoneline and summon corpses and rez and buff and all that, then jump into
the arena and huddle near a corner, then pull RZtW.  So far, we've gotten
him to 50%, 43%, and 9%.  In all instances, the adds come and beat us silly.

Now, I know strategies like this are considered top secret info by many
upper-tier guilds.  The thinking being something like, "We figured it out
all on our own, you should too!"  I can sympathize with that sentiment.  =)

Still, any advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated.  How, exactly,
do you handle all the adds during RZtW?

Thanks.  =)
