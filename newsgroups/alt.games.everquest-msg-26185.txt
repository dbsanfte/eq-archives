Wondering if this guy is a serious undercon, or requires some special
gear to damage him, or what?  We had a group hunting the undead at night
in Kith yesterday, 43 War, 39 Cleric, 39 Shammy, 36 Pally, 35 Wizard.  I
was pulling a variety of things fairly steadily and we were doing great.
Then I come across this guy and his pet. He cons blue, like most of the
others, so I figure "wtf?" and I pop an arrow into him.  I hadn't made
it more than two steps back towards our camp when I'm darkness, feared,
nuked for a couple hundred, and various other bits of unpleasantness.
By the time I get control of myself and get back to camp, I'm 3/4 dead
and the cleric is flushing mana into me already. We began wailing on
him, but I swear it seemed like I was completely unable to hit him. Just
the occasional bash. I think the shaman's pet was doing more damage than
I was. There were a couple adds, but they were small and I dont' think
they swung the fight much. (Dreaded wolf, a zombie of some sort, but not
the commander.) Several nukes landed on him, but it wasn't nearly enough
and we wound up running for the zone with a couple deaths on the way.
Nothing in the beastiary to describe him as anything unusual. Does he
require some extra special uberweapon or stats or ability, etc. to hit
him? And/or does he just have a metric buttload of HP?  I had no
negative symbols on my display (curses, debuffs, diseases, etc.) but I
could NOT land a shot on this guy except to bash him!
  What's the deal on this bag o' bones? He's a tough customer.
