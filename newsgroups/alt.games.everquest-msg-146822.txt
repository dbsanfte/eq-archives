And now with dots stacking??

Three level 53 epic druids:
3 epic dots + 3 Winged Deaths + 3 Drifting Deaths + 3
whateverimmolatesupgradeiscalled = one very dead critter in pretty much any
xp camp.  There's no reason NOT to invite a few druids along on a campaign
for damage instead of just for transport. :p

Yowza.  And I think necros & shaman are even better off, but my necro &
shaman are babies...don't know much about them.
