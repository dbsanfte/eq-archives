My level 12 warrior had an epic battle with half a dozen wisps in WC
last night. Buffed with SLN, she took on one wisp. As it happened,
that wisp had a few friends in the area... within 30 seconds, there
were four of them. She beat one of them down to flee mode and took off
for the EC zone, stopped near the zone and started beating on the
others. One more in flee mode, she entered berzerker mode, took on
another, killed it, killed the last one, took off after the second
fleeing wisp, killed it, went after the first wisp, found out that
that one had found two new friends, made one of them run off and
decided it was time to bow out before the last two killed her.

Critical hits are so neat - she had a 95 point crippling blow with her
18/37 axe during the fight, and gained 4 points in 2hs :)
