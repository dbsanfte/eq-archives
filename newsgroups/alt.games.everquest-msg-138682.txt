well, it depends  one your lvl if you below 45 i suggest getting the
highestdmg/dly combo  you can get,  b/c with the fast delay your going to be
drawing  more aggro  and makes it harder on the tanks but at hgiher lvls
whent he tanks can handle it better you can use faster weapons, something
really nice, is a goranga  spiked club, 13/25 5str 5sta  and  some other
stats ,  many monks have it , if you have lucling just go to Maidens  eye
and once every 10 minutes or so /ooc if anyone happens to have a goranga
spiked club  drop thats goin to rot  please let me know'
 or something to that effect  usually ppl  are  willing to let lowbies/
anyone looking for one loot em
