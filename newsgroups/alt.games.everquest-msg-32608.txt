I could accept that.

Especially since my main use for it would be, "there aren't
any rez-enabled Clerics in *this* zone, I wonder if there are
any in the zone next door I could bribe to come help me out..."

Currently I have do several "/who level1 level2 cleric all"
queries (broken down into several small level ranges so as
not to get "list was cut off because it was too large" errors.
It seems that it would be less work for the game, overall,
to just be able to do "/who dreadlands all", or "/who dreadlands
cleric all"
