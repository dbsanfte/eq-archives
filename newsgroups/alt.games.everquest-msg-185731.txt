I agree; Innothule Swamp (before the frogs took over) was a great
newbie zone; frogloks would drop netted magic armor, the kobolds would
sometimes drop bags and backpacks which was nice, and the large rats
would drop plague rat tails which you could sell for about 1.5 pp
each, which was good cash for an untwinked newbie.  It was a lot
better newbie zone than Nektulos Forest, for sure.
