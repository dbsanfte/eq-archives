Hmm, I don't know what it was called, but the first "Pill" caused birth
defects that were probably able to be extrapolated in 3-5 years.  Dunno,
before my time.  I have no idea how long it took to go through the FDA but
I'm sure there was plenty of pressure (from housewives and politicians) to
get it approved quickly.

Viagra may prove to be the next.  Its publicized side-effects are few and
generally mild, but it does put a strain on your heart.  But due to its
popularity with old men (those running the country) it sailed through
approval in record time (about a year).  Only time will tell if I'm right.
