Lol, what wonder .. a good 3D card makes a 3D game faster :) Ok, sarcasm
aside, the thing is pretty clear (uhm .. trying to not get too technical here): 

The MGA is a very bad 3D card (and always was .. they were excellent in 2D).
The GeForce is (nearly) the latest development that can be bought on market
(With exception to the GF3 and some other too new cards). Even if you had a
6 GHz Pentium, you could not even come close to matching the 3D cards
speed in rendering 3D graphics.

MHz on the card (and other flashy terms) only tell half the truth. Like with
CPU's, a graphics chip A might operate 10 times faster than graphics chip B,
even if B has double the MHz .. the A chips design is just vaster and better.

Memory on card is alos not just some general pointer to more speed. It defines,
how many textures it can hold, how deep and big your Z Buffer is and such things.
More is better, normally. but if 32 MB are THAT much worse than a current
64 MB card depends highly on the game and such again. There's also various kinds
of memory chips varying in speed, the bus interface between memory and grfx card
varies and so on. Also, the speed from main memory to your graphics card matters.
An older Athlon board with just 1x (or 2x, if they got past the bugs) AGP
transfer will load textures from main memory to graphics card a lot slower
than a current 4x model.

RAM will not speed up any graphics. It will speed up anything, where ram was
the bottleneck. You can get shitty graphics with not enough ram, but that's
only because you got sideffects (swapping etc) and that's not related to
the cards 3D rendering capabilites. More memory will help you in any situation,
where textures, 3D wireframes, landscape models and so on have to be loaded
and kept in ram (or they will have to load it from harddisk .. and we all
know a HD is incredibly slow compared to memory).

A fast CPU will help you in everything the machine has to do, that the 3D
card doesnt. 3D cards arent just coming in variable speeds. They also
come with variable abilities. Game 1 may run ultrafast on card A, Game 2
may be slow on card A, while game 1 will be just ok on card B but real
fast on card B. This all depends on how closely the games 3D engine was
programmed to match a certains cards features (See quake optimizations),
what features are used and which features can be handled by the graphics
chip and which have to be done by the computers CPU. The CPU also handles
all other aspects of the game (The artificial intelligence of hundreds of
units in a strategy game for instance).

In other words: The effective speed of your card depends on a LOT of 
variables (game, engine, speed of memory, chip, capabilities of chip etc)
and you can't just go: A is in general better than B.

Exchanging a 3d card from 1990 with one from 2001 will in
every case boost up your 3D rendering speed (which still can leave your
playing dogslow as your machine is stuttering on memory lows with the
harddisk). The newest, fanciest card of 2001 will only be faster
than the older model from 2000, if it speeds up features your game uses
or if (because of some tech breakthrough), has much more MHz than the
last card (using the same chip).

To make it easy: If you want a good graphics card now, buy a GeForce2 model.
Recently NVidia released the MX400 series, which a slightly faster kind
of the older 'ordinary' MX chipset (currently called MX200). They're cheap
and nearly are on GeForce 2 standard levels and will be enough for Luclin.
The Geforce 3 I own is too expensive right now and all other cards will get
less support .. NVidia kind of became the de-facto standard on PC's right now.
