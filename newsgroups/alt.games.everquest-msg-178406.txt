I have noticed that buildings arent really buildings in EQ but Just color
and form that mobs can run through with no problems at all.

Where is colision detection and the ability to be INSIDE a building and not
worry about a lion running through a wall and attacking ect ect

Will EQ ever get fixed of this problem as well

Many Thanks

Fallenwolf
