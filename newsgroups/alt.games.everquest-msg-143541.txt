I've only fought talendor a few times... but IMO hes no different to any
other dragon - he dispells in order.

My buff order in non-raids is -
1) Coldain ring
2) Epic/Shrunken gob earring
3-15) Buffs

Lately in SSRA I get annuled on a pull and sometimes lose buff 1, sometimes
buff 2, sometimes buffs 2 and 3...

I think dispell does a check against each buff before removing it, upto
whatever the spells limit is... if annuls limit is 4, then you could get
just the 4th dispelled.. and think it was random.

Until I see the very last buff get dispelled, whilst all others remain
(assuming I have 15 buffs up) then I will refuse to believe dispell is
random
