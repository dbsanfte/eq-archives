All low 50s?

You won't be moving from the entrance. Make sure you've got a good
puller. Some of the mobs can't be mezzed (probably none of them if
your enchanter is low 50s). Some of them are VERY fast. Some of those
fast ones proc a snare. Some are unsnareable in return. Given you
don't appear to be a raiding guild (if you don't even know where UP
is), you are unlikely to be uberequipped. These mobs have a ton of hp.
The fights are going to be long. They hit hard, they hit often. They
are all KOS. Some see invis. Aggro ranges seem to vary.

Good luck. Try not to train the other inevitable groups at the
entrance. :-p
