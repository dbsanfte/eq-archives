Mr Navarro, you are a gentleman and a scholar.
I was scared like I had never been scared before. I have seen the
ugly side of combat and it was nothing compared to the devastation I
witnessed, I thought I could handle anything... I was wrong. I don't
even want to go into what I saw or felt because it would  screw me up
good for  the rest of the day. 
Yeah, I didn't like Bush either but like we say, "You can hate the
man,but respect his position.

I like the idea of the reflecting ponds on the footprints of the
towers. That's only 2 acres out of 16, plenty of room for more
buildings.

God bless ya David.
