Cobalt Boots for 2.5kpp - sell in /auction for 4kpp
Sarnak Battlehammer for 50pp - others had for 500-800pp
Chetari Bonecrafted Shield for 1040pp - others were 1200-1600
Cobalt Vambrace for 2kpp
Then sold the pieces these purchases replaced (plus some bank fodder) for
5600pp, so its like getting paid to upgrade :)
