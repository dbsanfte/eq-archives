After a successful night adventuring (not) my main char in now in shard
hell so I thought I would be a perfect time to play my other neglected
chars. Namely my gnome mage whose been stuck on newbie island for the
last 2 months. Question is I don't know what subclass to make her, my
main a Wizard so that's out.

I quite like the thought of a summoner. You can blame FF for the
summoner liking but it strikes me as the best soloable mage class,
since your pet can tank for you. Is this thinking a reality? Strikes me
as being worse in groups then a wizard though, as their pet never seems
to come into play and their attacks are less then a straight caster
class.

Enchanters are an unknown to me. They seem rather overlooked on my
server, a plus as I like a unique looking char. The few experiences I
have of them are quite positive. Longer-term EQ players like the mezes
and the wards they have. Many times when I've been the one
recruiting, people have wanted an enchanter over a summoner. No idea
how they solo though.
