That's where I start to get skeptical. People complain that they can't do 
this or can't do that. How do they know? As the old saying goes, "can't" 
never did anything. Isn't it possible that they could improve their 
chances in some manner?

So these people in their 50's should be scrambling to level up so they 
can all still group. As soon as a person passes the trial, what is it 
exactly that changes so they can't group with the people they grouped 
with a few days ago?

You're telling my why it won't happen in a game people play for 
enjoyment, yet what you describe is why it won't happen in a game people 
play where levelling up is more important that the pure enjoyment of it 
all. If you have people "who generally are motivated to level and 
advance" in the same guild with people "who generally aren't as strongly 
motivated to level", then *of course* there is going to be a rift at some 
point. These people's intrests are not the same. What do you expect in 
that situation? 

The only true solution to the problem as you described it would be to 
make the higher tier zones less desirable to the higher level people. 
That way, they wouldn't be compelled to play where the lower level people 
are not effective. Whether the lower level people are flagged or not 
would not matter in that case.
