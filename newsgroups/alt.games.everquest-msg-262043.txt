Thanks for the link.  I agree with Jeb.  I already know the facts of this
case, including some portions that the media hasn't seen fit to discuss,
such as the woman is not and never has been considered brain dead.  Damaged,
yes.  The (legitimate) fears of many people opposed to such a decision is
that this enables people to kill off retarded kids, parents who have
strokes, etc.

I missed the fact that we were now talking about Jeb, though.  Just like the
Supreme Court of Florida missed the fact that every branch of government
needs to have a "check", including their own.
