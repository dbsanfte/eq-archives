There are pre-PoP items that have required levels but don't show
them.  But that "recommended above 50 equals required" is a line
of bullshit (not saying the Guide lied, that's probably the line
s/he was given by the powers that be).  A guildmate of mine
was using his Windblade (recommended level of 56) from the day he
got it at level 53.

If your AGI is under 75 fix it, above that it is just a small boost
to the "avoidance" aspect of your AC.  Those plaguebones must have
an incredible AC for their level, at no time in my career have I had
a repeatable miss rate worse than 50% vs. even or lower con mobs.

The mobs I solo for xp hit for over 100 a pop, doubling and tripling.
That doesn't stop me from watching for and acquiring minor upgrades to
AC, HP, or resists.

I wore Spider Fur for a week, then I spotted a cheap (at the time)
White Bear Pelt Cloak and emptied my bank buying it.

It is expensive.  The best bet seems to be to keep a decent cash
balance as best you can while watching prices.  That way you will
recognize a good deal when you see one and also have the pp banked
to take advantage of it.  Don't buy something just because you
want it really bad, buy it because it's a good deal, you get a lot
more mileage out of your pp that way (be prepared to take advantage
of a the occasional great deal on an item you don't need, there is
no wrong in obliging a seller in a hurry and later reselling for a
profit).

One final comment.  The "raider" types often seem (to me) to hype on
resists and "resist gear" being situational.  In my experience that
is at best half true.  While he never came out and said anything on
the topic directly, I noticed that Dan Day several times mentioned
"ordinary" resists (unbuffed, no gear swapouts) for his Paladin that
were far higher than mine.  So, at the same time that I was acquiring
some situational resist gear (mostly jewelry, little used to date) I
also started working to improve the resists of my regular gear.  The
difference is night and day, there're a lot of caster mobs out there
and I'm telling you that the difference between resisting 6 out of
7 casts, instead of 1 out of 7, on a messy pull can be the difference
between an exciting battle and a TPW.  I have seen a huge difference
between crap (under 30) and not too awful (over 50) resists when I'm
being cast on by blue con mobs.  The "resists are situational" crowd
is either (a) speaking a different language than me, or (b) referring
to multi-group raids where you are fighting much tougher mobs than in
an exp session (or possibly both).

Oh, and I do hope that you own a Skull-shaped Barbute.  There are
plenty of situations where +10 MR and +35 HP will be well worth
the loss of AC va. the Deepwater.  I didn't ditch my SSB until
I got a Helm of Raldukan, was still swapping it in once in a while
even at L53.
