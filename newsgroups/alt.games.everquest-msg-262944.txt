I haven't actually tried, because I assumed you could not.  I am
somewhat surprised that you can click off Fungal Regrowth, they
went through quite some time back and made everything with a
detrimental aspect non-removable (like Reckless Strength, which
might be the stupidest spell-line in the game now that you can't
dodge the negative).

Taunt is overrated by those who don't have it or understand it,
and often underrated by those who do.  Its single biggest flaw is
that, like Paladin stuns, it's weakest when you need it most (i.e.
vs. yellow/red con mobs).  It does help in holding aggro, but only
in the case where somebody at range has passed you on the hate
list but not by enough to actually draw aggro.  Since you don't
get to see the hate list, you're left mindlessly mashing the
button as you tank with no clear indication as to whether it is
necessary and/or successful.

Anyhow, back to the specific situation under discussion, unless
you're an overly righteous snob of a Paladin who refuses to mem
Cease because "it's not level appropriate" (one of the stupidest
damned things I've ever seen a Paladin post) you can hold aggro
at acceptable mana cost unless you're fighting mobs so tough
they interrupt/stun you all the time (in which case your healer
probably wouldn't be able to keep you alive for long anyway).
