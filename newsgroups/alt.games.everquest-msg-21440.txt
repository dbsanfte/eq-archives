Well, stop beating on her and just pay her. :)

The sites say 550g, and this is the way I did it back when I was doing
jewelcraft full time, but someone told me that 55p DOES work.  If you have
55p that you can afford to spend to check for yourself, please try it and
post your results here.

You can also try auctioning for purchase of the gems occasionally in any
zone in which high level folks hunt.  I know they drop OFTEN in Karnors, so
FV might be a good place.  I'm afraid I don't know how much to ask for
them...I'm guessing 40-45p (if I were in the market I'd probably get one,
then see how much an FV vendor would give me, then offer 5-10p more).
