The problem I have with this, and with the raid grouping in PoP, is that
I see new features as enhancements, not expansions, which I think should be
funded out of the monthly fees.  I don't like the idea that two characters
of the same race and class, who start in the same city, and fight in the
same zones, might not be equal because one has an expansion so has access to
more item slots or the player gets an enhanced interface that lets them play
the game better.  Games should, I think, try to take out the effect of real
world economic differences (including the ability to afford expansions) on
game advancement.  (This is my objection to ebaying equipment, too).
