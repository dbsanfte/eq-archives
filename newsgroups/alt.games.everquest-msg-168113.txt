Succor anywhere in SG take you around 3 sec run from the WW zoneline. 
There are 2 nonkos mobs there, and 1 mob wanders there on occasion. If 
you get aggro, just run to zoneline, unless you get chain stunned, a 50+ 
char, even a caster should be able to make that run. Just dont go AFK 
while succoring.
Doubt the mob is wandering around much though. On my server, SG is a 
VERY underused zone, so usually only people in zone are the ones im 
taking through, and in the last half year my guild been raiding ToV, and 
me passing/taking people through SG between 3-10 times a week (getting 
the rest of the people, so can usually go through several times for 1 
raid), i got aggro from that mob once.
