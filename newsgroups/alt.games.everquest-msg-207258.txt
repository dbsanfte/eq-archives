Blessed Faydark Series of bows are great for twinking...and they come
in 3 or 4 stages (Blessed Faydark Stinger being the entry level model)
...decent damage/stats and not too hard on the wallet.

Weight Reduction Quivers add 1/3 of the WR as Bow haste.,..i.e.
Tailored Quiver...which is 10% WR gives you a 3% haste or so to bow
delay. Fleeting Quiver (60% WR ) gives 20% haste for bow delay.

Not that I know of...I alway assumed that your attack rating applied
to everything...i.e. Throwing, Archery, Primary, etc...so I'm kinda
ignorant when it comes to this stat.

As far as I know, haste items do not affect Archery...except quivers

No double attacks with bows.../cry
But we do get double damage bow shots at later levels as well as
critical hits.

Don't quite understand what yer asking here...but I'll ramble on
anyway cuz I like t hear my own voice...erm...so to speak. 

Rangers only get crits in archery...yes. 
Don't know the formula for crits....but yes...IMHO, Rangers are far
more effective at dealing damage than warriors...but then I'm biased.

A rooted mob will never run...he will continue to fight until he is
dead. Period. Very Inefficient to root mobs unless you need to park
adds. 

Now that doesn't mean the root/shoot method isn't effective...(bow
shots do not break root the way melee and DD dmg spells do.)
Or fear kiting isn't effective...

The best technique for me is to snare a mob at the begining of the
fight...and once they hit 20% they will typically stop fighting and
kindly stand in place for you to finish them off....not all mobs, mind
you...but most.

I think I stopped tanking...erm...around my 40s or so..closer to my
50s. 

Was I the best choice? By no means! But could I do it with minimal
downtime between fights? Yes, I could. I suppose with the right gear,
I could still do a somewhat decent job of tanking now...at least for
Old World Mobs...
