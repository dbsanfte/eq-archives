It's a spell you need to have.  There are a few uses for it (though not
many) but if you need it, you NEED it.  No rush to buy it, but pick it up
when you can afford to.

For fun.  That's the biggest reason to get all (but your own) illusion.
Enchanters are an extremely powerful class but one thing that makes that
class FUN, as opposed to another extremely powerful class, clerics, is the
illusions.

Troll/Iksar give regen (troll is better by one point unless they've changed
it)
Ogre - if you're a gnome enchanter you can really appreciate this one when
people keep getting in your way. <g>  Ogres also get BASH, though it's
always skill 1.  I THINK trolls do, too, but I KNOW that ogres do.  Fairly
useless though.

Since you didn't bring up the non-race illusions I'll assume you know that
all of them are useful except regular skeleton.

Not that I've noticed.  I'll cast it on folks if we're going to be doing
something particularly difficult if I have enough mana, otherwise I don't
bother.  I've yet to hear a DEFINITIVE explanation, only a lot of guesses,
some from people who know what they're talking about.
