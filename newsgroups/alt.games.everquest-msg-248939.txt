Omg I wish it meant that!  LOL  We're trying to sell our house right now and we
need to clear 7 grand from the sale.  We still owe 3.5 so we're asking for 12
o.b.o. because we're willing to go down as far as 10.5.  

I would love to have someone offer 15 or more!  hehe

And yes, the house is what you would call a bit of a fixer upper...  =P
