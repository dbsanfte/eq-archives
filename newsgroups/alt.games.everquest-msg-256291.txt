Yep, yep, begging for it.  I wasn't just freshly 46, I literally came in 
after the kill that dinged me, a low DB in Gunthak.  I was hoping to die 
and lose level just to see how that worked!

No, thats not true.  I carefully stayed back in the back of the exit 
corrider, where experience tells me I wouldn't aggro anything while 
fighting, a distinct problem in much of the zone at my level; take one 
swing at a mob and get 5 adds coming from every direction, where someone 
5 levels higher can fight in the halls and get nothing.

Those adds were entirely the puller's fault, not that I have a chance in 
hell of pulling in there without doing the same at my level.

Yep yep, only trouble being at level 10 you would be too low to get exp 
while grouped with anyone legitimately in the zone

It would be fun to deliberately delevel a whole group, say down to level 
40, and then hunt and watch the exp roll back in.

Aye, and that was my operating plan... but the group wanted to go 
somewhere else and I was willing to try.  The camp they selected had 
similar geometry, a far corner so I could stay away from the corridor 
and yet not back up to where I could aggro other mobs thru the walls. 
There are definately places in POJ where it will be impossible for me to 
fight without bringing down the roof on us where anyone a few levels 
higher would have no trouble, but this wasn't one of them.

Yeah, well I -was- pushing things to see how solid his aggro was, I 
mean, disarm is to be honest a worthless skill, other than generating a 
bit of additional aggro.  No reason at all for me to be clicking it in 
there, other than to see if I could one up his claim that he'd not let 
the mobs hit me.

I've never cared for POI, preferring POJ, POD, PON.  The mix of 
unslowable unmezzable mobs popping in the trash kill area is just 
irritating.

Dulak and Gunthak are currently on the Hot Zone list, while PoP exp got 
nerfed sometime last year, so POP zones are at something like 126 ZEM 
while Gunthak/Dulak are at 156 or so.  Plus in general, LOY mobs tend to 
not hit as hard; I can solo the scouts there while I'm pretty sure I'll 
need at least a duo anywhere in POP for a few levels yet.

The advantage to POP zones, though, is that they are soooo much easier 
to get to; to get to Dulak I have to swim across an ocean, blow 10pp on 
invis potion, and run like a bat out of hell hoping it doesn't break 
early, or else create a train the size of the Orient Express and hope I 
don't get snared or rooted while crossing the village just in front of 
the Dulak zone line, then I have to do the same thing headed back with 
the added incentive of knowing that if I end up with a train when I hit 
the beach I'm just going to have to die there as I can't outrun the 
train while swimming across to the lighthouse, and its better to die 
where I can find the body!

Gunthak was much better but the beach has gotten to the point where half 
the mobs are green and most of the rest are cyan, while the tunnel is a 
joy because other people travelling to Dulak or other points do the same 
thing, run thru with an outrageous train either because they didn't 
bother with invis or because it broke midway across.  I haven't done the 
villages in Gunthak yet due to lack of a group with interest in it; solo 
the multiple pulls and caster mobs are too much trouble.

Well yes, thats a dream to be sure, but honestly its just a case of 
lazyiness at work, with a 6 second refresh timer it can take a while to 
build up a respectable store of axes, and you can't do it while sitting 
to get hp back fast.  Ideally I'd make a new stack every four pulls or 
so on average... but better would be some way to monitor my stacks of 
axes visibly;

I'm thinking of permanently leaving a backpack full of axes open, so I 
can see whats going on.  I have the space where my other characters keep 
their spell icon list available for the purpose, will just take a little 
getting used to.

See B)!  Not running out is ideal, but since it keeps happening anyway, 
this observation notes that they really are a big part of my ability to 
fight, and worth looking for a way to fix things if I do run out.

My first high level character was a cleric, who could contribute 
meaningfully in a group of level 50's (high end in the game at the time) 
at level 39, and when I ran a second cleric up in levels, could 
contribute meaningfully in a group of 60s (high level at -that- time) at 
level 39 (but not get exp till 40).  So I'm always somewhat sensitive 
about when my characters of other classes might just be soaking up exp 
without doing anything.

My thought Exactly.  Things going well is satisfying, but things going 
crazy is fun!
