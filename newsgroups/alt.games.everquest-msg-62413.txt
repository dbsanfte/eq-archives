All of ours always came with the PCs from Gateway / Dell, and they pretty 
much come with 3-Com, and if they didn't, we had them put it in.  The only 
other choice was Intel, and we were already 100% 3-Com, so we stuck with 
them in the desktops.  In the whole place, we had 1 Intel NIC in a server.

At my job previous to this one, I was administering about 1500 PCs on the 
network, and having them all the same brand helped.  You can imagine the 
amount of space I took up on the Drivers volume with all the drivers for 
all the pieces of hardware in every machine.  Having only 3 different 
models of 1 brand NIC really helped. In the 6 years that I was there, I can 
only recall 1 NIC being bad, and it worked, but was just very flakey - had 
to be replaced.

If I were to go to a smaller shop where I were building the PCs, I would 
definitely go with something cheaper.  Makes total sense when you look at 
price / performance.

I only use 3COM at home because they are free =)  I have a stack of them 
that were surplused from the last job and I was lucky enough to get some.  
I install the cheaper SMC and the such cards in my friends' machines 
because they pay for them at $15 a pop or so.  They are pretty well 
suported on all platforms, including Linux, so they are all happy.  They 
don't need remote management and all the extra hooplah that you get with 
the expensive cards.

There are brands I won't touch or let the friends have, but I'm sure we all 
have our own "hated hardware".
