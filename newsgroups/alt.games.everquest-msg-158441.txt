If you're in the initial safe spot or one of the pull spots
after you've been clearing, it's as safe as any zone of that
level can be.

None of the guilds in those screenshots are Zeb's better
guilds.  PoF is a one or two group clearing for CRs, as long
as the people being rezzed aren't idiots and the group doing
the CR is past that level.  I've certainly done it with a
guild pick-up group of five for Grayson's Few (and some other
tag-along guilds) after they'd died three times trying to
break it.
