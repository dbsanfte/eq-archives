I wouldn't say they have been nerfed, but they don't get some of the cool
stuff that other classes get. Mages get no way for mana regen when all other
pure casters get some form - don't even say mod rod, they are worthless cost
more mana to summon one than they give back and they are lore, plus we don't
have enough HP to really use them. We have no way to snare fear or root
(pets root is resisted most of the time). Our right clickable items always
for reclaim energy - not real desirable. Our only feature is our pet and
that is not always wanted due to terrible pathing and the pets unerring
ability to get add on agros.
That being said I still enjoy my mage, but do get a little tired of being
the overlooked class. But one definite advantage is that I never have to go
anon or roleplay because other don't want to bug me for a
sow/tp/C2/buffs/rez/group hehe.
