In AO there's no problems with this.  Um, lets see in EQ terms it would
be like having a key to a zone, soulbound, and you can make copies (say
a right click effect) which you give to whomever you want to be able to
enter the same copy of the dungeon with.  Of course in AO you don't have
to do CRs either.

O.k. I read up on the FaQ again, and it's just Jedi who get perma death,
althogh you have "a couple" lives before it's permanent, and it will
actually be a 2nd slot, so you will be able to have two characters per
server, one normal, one Jedi. Although you have to do something to
unlock the jedi slot which is of yet undetermined.

Also if your jedi gets to be a master he doesn't die, he becomes a "blue
glowie" like in the movies.  I'm not sure what fun a blue glowie is
going to be.

The whole thing sounds weird and ill-conceived.

I would consider it, but there's so many things that can go wrong that
would get you killed, LD most common, Griefers training you, Falling
through the world or other bugs.  The only way you'd be able to have a
server like that is if you had a dedicated GM 24 hours a day to rez
people that were killed from one of the other forms of death.

I'm still more interested in a monster server, where you could play the
monsters like they did for all of 1 or 2 days...
