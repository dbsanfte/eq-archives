I'd have a similar question about Solusek Ro. There are lots of German speaking
guilds (some of them very powerful), a lot of Spanish speaking guilds, at least
one Swedish and one French guild.. but what are totally missing are general,
English-speaking, UK or general Euro-based guilds from what I've seen. 

If anyone could give a hint of a decent 45+ level English-speaking guild on 
that server that'd operate on European (or even Asian) times, please speak up.
