Damn, I spent all that play on my wizzies spells...why dont people give him money (I will port for free when I can port, I aint gonna sit around charging people for it).


No, your swords cost you time -- time spent acquiring the plat to buy
them. The exact same thing mana costs you. Time spent regenning mana
and sitting running a "buffing station" is time not being spent
hunting and getting money that way.

While I never have and never will require money for ports and buffs, I
don't frown on those that do. True, I don't use their services (I make
due without them), but I don't think they're wrong for charging. (What
does bug me minorly is those who refer to their required fee as a
"donation"....) Also, I'll sometimes offer a voluntary donation to
those not requiring a fee.

By the way, fix your margins on your newsreader. That's damn ugly like
that when the lines don't wrap themselves...
