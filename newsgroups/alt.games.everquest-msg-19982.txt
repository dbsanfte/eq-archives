You will not evade me, "Dan Harmon" <deharmon@bigfoot.com>:

His reaction made it a demand. And to my ears, 'sow plz' is a pretty
demanding tone for a request, it's "SOW ME NOW!! - please"; a demand
with a semi polite plz tacked on. I get a ton of sow plz's when I am
grouped and the others need to run faster; if somone comes up to me
out of the blue and says that, he doesn't get anything without at
least the Magic Word.

If the guildmate is naked, it is.

That's because the unwillingness to interrupt a nearly cast spell is
NOT the issue, although it has become an issue for you.

My guildmates wouldn't 'sow plz' me. And they wouldn't come running up
out of the blue when I am porting.

The inconvenience of not having a sow can be smaller than the
inconvenience of not having a port across the world, so I am more
likely to stop for an extra passenger wanting to go my way. (And no, I
don't demand payment for ports...) Also, there is a very fair chance a
sow beggar could find another person to cast the spell in the zone, as
opposed to the person looking for a port finding another porter in
most zones. Do you really not see the difference between stopping to
port someone and stopping to sow someone, especially when the spell is
almost cast already?

Remember, not all guilds are as close knit as yours (or mine, for that
matter). What is ruder to the port passengers - stopping to help
someone who also wanted to go that way, or stopping to sow
