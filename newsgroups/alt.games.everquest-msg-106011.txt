He might be referring to a part of the soulfire quest (soulfire is a
necessary step in the paladin epic) that required you to hand four
Drom's Champagnes to an NPC.  Drom's Champagne was LORE last I looked,
tho I have been told it is no longer (have not verified that claim
myself).  Even if they've changed Drom's Champagne to non-LORE, that
quest was in-game for a couple years requiring multi-questing.
