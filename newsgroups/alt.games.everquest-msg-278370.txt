Actually, no. By installing the EQ client software, then using it with
third party software (in this case the EQemu site), you are in direct
violation of the EULA.

Then you have agreed not to use the license for which you have paid.
This includes, but is not limited to, non-use of said product.

No. They are *potentially* in violation of wiretap regulations in their
area, however.

No, he would be in violation of the DMCA in this case.

Now, say your brother, who is not a player of the game, starts sniffing
packets on the house network. NOW we start hitting the loopholes I
suspect at least some of the EQemu developers might be using.

Never said otherwise.  Elsewise OpenOffice would be in a heapload more
trouble.

Ah, but there my be an issue with IP regulations.

Tell me you are a lawyer and I'll concede.  However my understanding of
this, as with most commercial software, is that you do not actually own
said software.  You have LEASED a LICENSE to make use of said software
in a manner that complies with the EULA.

More accurately; there SHOULDN'T be anything illegal about reverse
engineering-

Here, I agree with you 100%.  I never said nor claimed these laws were
in any way good, sane, or justifiable.  Now if you good people reside
in areas where the laws governing so-called Intellectual Property are
sane, then have at.  Me, I live in the Great Nation of the Stupid and
Paranoid.

Good day, friend citizen.  I certainly hope you're not criticizing The
Law; such actions may be considered treasonous (If you've never played
Paranoia, then disregard this reference).

Again, I agree with you completely, and point to the low quality of
software coming from many closed-source commercial ventures.

finding

I again agree; that is how things SHOULD work.  Heh, I *AM*, actually,
a Systems Security Administrator :)

I'm not quite sure what you were saying at the end of that statement,
but I do agree that EULA's are pretty weak nd often unenforcable in the
end.  However, they are there, and do at least make some token efforts
to digitally provide a sort of contract between the software licensor
and software licensee.

Never said it was.  However, they do infringe on Sony's IP by making
use of copyrighted material; such as Norrath, Iksar, Luclin, Fier'Dal,
Tier'Dal, Koada'Dal, Faydwer, Kunark, Qeynos, Oggok, etc. etc. This
makes it a grey area at best, as they are using Sony copyrighted
material in a public exhibition without proper authorization.

Actually, there have been some interesting news articles over the
course of the past year of companies such as Gator going after people
in the US for just that. Scary stuff. This nation is completely futzing
insane.

If it were for personal, non-public or non-commercial use? No. If it
were for public and/or commercial use? Absolutely, and Games Workshop
would be completely within their rights to come down on me full force.

Perhaps you've never heard of a little company called FASA? They did
something very similar to that. To their credit they were under the
impression they had gotten proper permission to use the liknesses of
the Macross, Crusher Joe, and Dougram mechs. FASA went under from the
lawsiut expenses, and BattleTech will never be the same. I still miss
my Tournament legal LAM's.

Woah, cool down there, B.  US laws are incredibly insane, often inane,
but they can still be enforced and that's what makes them scary.

Actually, in both instances, they own copyright.  That right there
gives them say in how their properties are used.
