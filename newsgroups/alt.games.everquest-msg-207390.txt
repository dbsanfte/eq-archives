Oh well.  Most Druid DoTs (at least most of them up thru L44) are
10 ticks long, so Extended Affliction added a clean 20% to their
total damage.  Solo, most of my DoTs run to completion.  Grouped,
if the mob is at all tough my DoTs run to completion (I'm playing
on Stromm these days, no uber twink melees in my groups).  So,
they've increased my DPS by less than 10% (I am presuming they'll
truncate all fractional damage increases rather than rounding) in
exchange for reducing my mana efficiency by more than 10%.  I was
mistaken in believing this would be an enhancement.
