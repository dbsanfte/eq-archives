I waited six months to try that game.  Six months, because I knew I wouldn't
be leaving EQ for it, but I wanted to experience it at its best.  Picked it
up, played it some.  Saw a *lot* of good things, and (for the most part) a
pretty good "Star Warsy" feel.  But the game had three huge downfalls.

First, it revolves, nay, is *built* around crafting.  The crafting system is
interesting, deep, creative, and blows EQ's crafting system out of the
water.  But...  I never saw anyone actually buy/make weapons, clothes, or
much of anything else in Star Wars.  A couple droids and a piece for a ship,
over the span of 5 movies, does not make crafting an integral part of the
Star Wars universe.

Second, the built in macroing system.  You could literally macro your way to
the top, but only if you picked the right classes to do it with, as the
macroing system was super powerful, but had some rather bizarre lacks.

Third, there is no up and down.  Yes, the whole entire game, no matter what
it *looks* like, is as flat as a pancake.  The smallest pebble in your path
would bring you to a dead stop, as you had no ability to climb or jump.  A
3d world without jumping is just absurd.

All that said, it was worth it to mess around for a while in the Star Wars
universe.  But I don't see how the game retains people past the first month
or two of "Cool, I saw that in the movie!"
