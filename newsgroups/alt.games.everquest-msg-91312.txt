That is an "annoyance" bug. I put that waaay down on the list from "can't 
play" bugs, or "users can exploit this" bugs.

Verant has no way of triple checking every AS path that could possibly lead 
to one of their customers. If they can get in from somewhere external, then 
the server is fine.

As far as "so close they can probably walk to the site", please give me 
IP's and router names on the hops you have seen problems with. I am 
interested in how you think you can tell.

Ooooh, so you aren't talking about *cheating*, you are just talking about 
using things the game has given you. Like, say, bad pathing. That's 
*totally* different.

The newest GEForce drivers fix the GEForce problems. As for the 
Soundblaster issue, that is one I do not understand myself.

So, if you and I were playing the same game, to the same server farm, why 
did I receive none of these? Could it be that you have network issues?

If one of your ISP's peering points peers with SOE, and that peering point 
should go down(due to BGP flapping, EM interference, act of god, whatever) 
then you would LD, while retaining perfect connection to the rest of the 
net. Link flapping especially would cause repeated LD's. So, basically you 
*don't* know that it isn't your connection.

Well, they do. Their is an outage page that remains pretty much up to date, 
AFAICT.
