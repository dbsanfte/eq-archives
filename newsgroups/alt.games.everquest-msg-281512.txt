People are still doing this today.   You see all these empty spaces in
the bazaar and you have people standing all over you when you are
trying to sell and it's even worse when you try to buy something off
someone that another person is standing on top of.   If they were real
life vendors, I would knock them on their ass and then buy what I
need.
