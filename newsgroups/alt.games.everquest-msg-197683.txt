Proof is all I want. If it's so easy, please produce it. Please. Some 
people say their guild split up because the situation was too stressful. 
I say that may be true, but the possibility also exists that maybe it 
wasn't so unbearably stressful - more of an inconvenience - but that was 
an easy out for the flagged people to go on about their own business 
guilt free. Then the story goes that it was the trials that broke up the 
guild, when in that case, it was a lack of loyalty on the part of the 
flagged that broke up the guild. I frequently see people leave a great xp 
group because they had guild business which needed their presence. Often 
they weren't real thrilled about having to go, but they did anyway. Who's 
to say  whether they got back into another good group that night or not?

Or maybe a guild was demanding an unreasonable amount of the flagged 
people's time to get others flagged. That could certainly cause problems. 
In that case, however, it wouldn't be the trials that broke up the guild, 
it would be the guild that broke up the guild. The leadership would be 
lacking.

The gear problem, if it *is* in fact a show-stopper, cannot really be 
solved aside from raiding or allying with other guilds and raiding if 
your guild is not large raid capable. I can certainly see where that my 
throw a road block into the situation.

I just have a hard time accepting that all these guilds dissolve when 
there is still so much they can do together, and that it's all because of 
that evil Executioner trial.

The human condition is surely a much larger contributor in much of it.

The possibility of smaller family or casual guilds even being qualified 
to pass the trial is a seperate issue.
