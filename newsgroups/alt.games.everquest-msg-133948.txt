not to be a jackass, but i think you're both wrong

if you get a port to SF, you can just run a little and zone directly into OT

sure, its a mean scary zone with dragons and stuff, but for the convenience,
and taking the fact that it *IS* a video game, i vote for the exciting
action every time, as opposed to the POS run through FM with the see-invis
giants, or through DL with the cliffs, see-invis everything, or trying to go
through EJ where every 2 seconds you get lost / have to dodge stuff

go get a map, and take the high road (geographically) to SF

will invis and port you, point you in the right direction, and give you
