That nails it, and it isn't just the Rogue being stressed.  In a group
with multiple pets mobs get kicked all over the place and it's simply
not possible to maintain relative positioning all the time, it's often
difficult to just stay in melee range all the time.  BST's are the
worst in my experience, because both the BST and his pet are kicking
the mob, usually from the same direction.  Throw in a caster using
spells with push (don't these people think about what they're doing
ever?) and it only takes about 10 seconds worth of melee before I'm
ready to scream.
