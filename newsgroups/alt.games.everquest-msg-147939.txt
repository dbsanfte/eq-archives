How deep are those wells?  The deepest I've dragged is in Lake Rathe.  I was
killed in the Goblin tower in one of the tunnels under the lake, and was
able to drag the corpse while swimming on the surface.

It's also possible that the distance limit depends on the zone.  I think
dungeons may do more Z checking than non-dungeons.
