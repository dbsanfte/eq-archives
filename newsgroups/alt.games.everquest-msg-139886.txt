The wolves (all kinds, afaik) will aggro.  They seem to appear out of 
nowhere.  Annoying little bastards.  Weirdly, some of the zelniaks 
conned as scowling, ready to attack, and others as indiff.  I have yet 
to figure out which ones con which.  Shrooms attack and sometimes hang 
around the base of the walls, so watch for them.  Oh, and they seem to 
be popular train items, for some reason.  Tribals all conned dubious to 
me (DE rogue with no religious affiliation, except worshipping my own 
beautiful self).  *Everything* in that zone appears to be social.
