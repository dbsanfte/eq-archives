Yesterday, playing in the tutorial, the mushrooms weren't spawning on 
the ground, the corpse summoner was on the other side of the lake, and 
Poxan's sword wasn't spawning on the ground.

Same story today, but later in the day my son was playing and noticed 
that there was now a "mushroom barrel" with mushrooms inside, and he was 
able to get a mushroom and complete the quest with that.

Still later, as in about a minute ago, I was trying to log in to EQ, did 
the standard patch check, but instead of "play" the button reads 
"download".  Press that, it downloads a file, then reads the same. 
Repeat as often as you like, each time the exact same file is loaded.

I'm going to reboot and see if that fixes it, otherwise I guess I'll 
have to tinker around more.

Lance
