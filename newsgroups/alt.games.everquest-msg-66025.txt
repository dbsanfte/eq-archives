Next time, read your license agreement. Verant implicitly disclaims
the implied warrant of merchantability in the EULA.  That alone will
get any ridiculous class action lawsuit laughed out of court.

Secondly, if you live in one of the states whose legislators are backwards
and ignorant enough to have passed UCITA, the software industries
get out of jail free legislation, you have no hope. Not familiar with
UCITA? Do a google search. You should be.

Class action lawsuit, lol. Maybe you can get some idiot scheisster lawyer
to take it in the hope of a settlement, but I doubt if he will on
contingency.

And bet on it that Sony will outspend and outlawyer anyone silly enough
to try.
