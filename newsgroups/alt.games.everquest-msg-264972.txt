Alright, I'll chip bite.  I love a 'fave rpg' thread =).

Early 80's it was D&D.  King of the hill, and the only thing able to
purchased retail in my suburban backwater.

Once our group found the local gaming store though, it bolied down to
3:  Champions; Warhammer FRP; and a little bit of Shadowrun 1st ed
when it came out.

WFRP easlily outpaced D&D as our fantasy game of choice.  The ease of
the combat system and the fun we had with some of the sub-systems
(Insanity, fate, criticals. chaos mutations, et al) really made it a
hoot.  We tried the bought modules but mostly ignored them.  I ended
up converting obscure TSR and Judges guild modules mroe often than
not.  

Then came M:tG, and then UO and EQ, and it became harder to get
together to play.  Though a couple have metioned some intertest in
HackMaster...  might be time to go retro..
