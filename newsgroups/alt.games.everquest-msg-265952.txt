I always feel the differences in mobs are what accounts for the less 
negative view of kill-stealing, as well as the role-play element. In CoH 
the mobs tend to come in much larger packs and it's much easier for a 
single player to take them on, so you'll often find one guy taking on 
ten opponents, and there's always one or two which get frightened and 
run away to safety, or to pull out a machine gun. I personally have no 
problem with other players picking off these stragglers, and if you've 
hit the opponent before the other guy finishes him off, you get the 
experience for your part in the 'arrest'.
