In effect, yes.
They will appear beside their corpse with no equipment (until they loot it
back off their corpse), and a nasty rez effect which reduces stats for a
short(ish) period of time (basically dont do anything but rest until it
wears off).
Reanimation does not give back any experience. There are higher level
rezzes, which give back some of the experience lost when the player died,
the amount increases with higher level rez spells.
