Honestly, considering the time it takes to gather vial components it's much
easier for me to just pay the 1.7p per vial from a vendor.  My friend will
make them for me for free, but even then I don't think it's worth HER time
and carpal tunnel syndrome to make something I can buy relatively
inexpensively.  I say "relatively" because my 52 enchanter has 70p to his
name. :)
