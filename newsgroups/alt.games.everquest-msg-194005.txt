Yeah, half of that is somewhat accurate.  Of course Sony *always*
under estimates how long the patches will take. I cannot remember the
last time a 6-hour scheduled patch took 6 hours.  Note that right now
it is three hours past the scheduled "up" time and the servers are
still down.

Even more useless is the network status page (this is not it), which
seems to show the status of the servers perhaps, but not the log-in
server.  So if the servers are up for testing and patching, we get a
green light, regardless of whether we can actually log in.
