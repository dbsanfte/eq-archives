Back when I was leveling my druid I never advertised, but I'd hang
around in zones where it was common for people to be looking for ports
and only offer my services to those who stated a price in their request
I felt was worth my time. Personally, I never liked the donations thing
and I don't want to have to deal with morons telling me my price wasn't
fair so I found a solution that worked for me and used it. It worked
well enough to equip my druid up past his newbie gear into something
that let him do the frontier mountain cycle for cash and forget about
porting.

I avoid bothering with selling cleric buffs with my cleric main now for
the same reason. I saw people offering less than the going rate for kei
for aego back when that was the best hp buff around dispite the fact
that it took more mana to cast and took reagants to cast. Much as I'd
like to get the 60k I paid for HoV back, selling buffs doesn't look like
the way to do it, for me at least.
