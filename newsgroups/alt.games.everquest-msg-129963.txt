Bah.  I can recall being in Unrest and seeing practically the whole
zone sneering at a couple of twinks who showed up shouting that they
were L20 Paladins with Ghoulbanes looking for a group.  Twink envy
used to be a whole lot worse.  I couldn't afford a Ghoulbane until L30,
a month or two after Kunark opened.  At L20 my main weapon was a
Deepwater Harpoon (it's a heavy 2hs with halberd graphic) 18/40 5wis
5sta 13.0wt PAL only, and I was "accused" of being a twink more than
once for owning such a nice weapon.  Nowadays you would probably have a
hard time giving one of them away, it's probably been over a year since
anybody did the quest.  At L27 I was able to upgrade my Silvery Waraxe
(6/22 1hs) to a Deepsix Cutlass, how long has it been since you've seen
anybody use either of those weapons?  At L35 I managed to get a Mithril
Two-handed Sword and never used Ghoulbane again except to practice 1HS
skill, now the M2H is another of the nearly worthless obsolete weapons
out there (I remember when nobody would sell an M2H at all, then after
a while a few were for sale for 10K, now they're what, 300pp?).

Anyhow, while there's no particular point to my rambling, I think I
meant to say that with the (by today's standards) crappy weapons I had
back then Root was absolutely essential if I wanted to kill the mob
instead of dying to a train, it was huge.  And with Invis vs. Undead in
addition to Root I could solo in Unrest at a time when Paladins were
often unwelcome in groups due to the evil 40% exp penalty.  L22 was
when I "arrived", simply because I was no longer forced to sit on my
hands or go off and work on my smithing due to lack of a group.
