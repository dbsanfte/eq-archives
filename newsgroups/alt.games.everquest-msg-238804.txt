Or were once "that good"... and the no-drop tag was never removed...
or were never "that good" and are no-drop for no particularly good
reason at all.

The newbie armour is a good example of no-drop stuff thats sort of
silly. The reason its no-drop is because SOE wants you to quest it,
instead of being handed a set of handmedowns the minute you log in.

The reality is that the only people who quest it are roleplayers, or
those who just get amusement from doing the quests. You can buy better
armour that isn't no drop for a fraction of the effort it takes to get
the newbie armour (depending on race/class to a degree).

Plus if you got the newbie armour, you will upgrade it shortly
thereafter anyways in your twenties and thirties, and there is nothing
you can do with your obsolete newbie armour except destroy it which
only adds insult to injury if you spent weeks collecting it.

The saddest no-drop equipment is much of the midlevel equipment from
early expansions, stuff that a 25th level player could personally get
in 1999... today's newbie armour quest is superior... so if you've
done your newbie armour and then go do one of these quests you end up
with a piece of no-drop armour that is vastly inferior to the stuff
you got at level 6... and again you can't even sell it to the
merchants or donate it for tribute.
