Not necessarily.  For instance, my rogue at 60 can solo level 50 casting
mobs
effectively, taking MUCH less damage and ending fights MUCH quicker
than against melee mobs.  The only exception to this is mobs with damage
shield- or harmshield-type effects.  Killing yourself while killing a f'ing
ranger
mob sucks.

OTOH, not many melee characters would go after a low-resist magic-gimp
mob that just happened to quad for 450.  You know, one that root and
ensnare stick on 100%, and that DoTs appear to do 2x damage on...
