Yes, you are correct, you jogged my memory on that. I knew I had to do the
quest myself for my ex, who had a pally but didn't want to go through
getting all the 'dusty old' pieces, so I used my druid (which I was playing
at the time) to collect the items. The items were no drop, the resulting
spell was not. If I remember correctly, it was a healing spell of some sort
that is pally-only.

Thanks for the reminder. :)
