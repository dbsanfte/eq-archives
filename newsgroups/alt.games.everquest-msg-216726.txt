Oh dear, go do some research!  To even approach VT quality you're
looking at the top end LDoN items AND top end augments in every slot.
Add up the amount of points all that costs and divide that by 51
(assuming you win every time which in crappy bazaar gear you might
well not) to get the amount of wins you'll need.

Guess what - this would involve MONTHS of work for each item even
doing LDoN every night for hours - can you say LDoN burnout?  I think
you can.
