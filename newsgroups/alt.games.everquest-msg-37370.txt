Actually I think 100 pp sounds about right, for the aggrivation factor of
making the clerics entire group stop what they're doing, blow a bunch of mana
on me, and then wait for the cleric to meditate back to full.

And before you say anything about greed etc, let me point out that I play a
warrior, not a cleric. (although I do have a cleric twink thats around level
28)

For a mana based resurrection, I've never given less than 50 pp, and usually
will give 100.

A rez stick resurrection is something else though. ; )   I mean I appreciate
all the time they put into Ragefire, and will give them something for that,
but 100 pp for a right click that takes 10 seconds and doesn't cost mana...
thats a bit much.
