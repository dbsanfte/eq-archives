Greetings all,

my system is configured as follows
AMD XP2100+ ( not overclocked ) aego stepping
512MB samsung PC2700 DDR
Asus A7V333 bios 1014, Via 4in1 4.45
Powercolour Radeon 8500 64MB 275mhz ( not overclocked )
Drivers version 5.13.01.6166
Direct X 8.1

I play both Everquest and Neverwinternights (v1.10)

Neverwinternights can be played for 2-5 mins and the the screen frezzes
no mouse movement no keyboard response (only reset or powerbutton responds
and reboot does not force chkdisk)

Everqeuest is random it can be played for 5 hours and not freeze
or can freeze in 15 mins and less

I have tried the Radeon 8500 in my Asus PIII 750 system and can play
both games for hours and never freeze ( ever ! )

I have tried the Following :
update bios on MB to 1014
reseated Memory and AGP card
increased airflow (CPU temp is 52-57C)
Via 4.45 drivers

any help on this would be greatly appreciated

regards
Nexus
