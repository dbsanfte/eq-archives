	DOT damage has been cut by 50% seemingly across the board.
Swarming death did 250 now it does 102, Winged Death did 140 now it does 66.
Mana cost is the same, duration is the same, oh yeah cast time is less BFD.

	WTF are these guys thinking?  No need for ports what with POK
Maguses and Guild hall, can't solo because we can't DOT and anything
worth killing summons...  This is bullshit.  A level 63 DOT that does
102 damage per tick???  Give me a break already.
