I can beat that.  (And this was even before players
could customize text colors.)

A guy gathered volunteers to form a group in EC, with the intent
of sneaking through Nek forest (we were all "good" characters)
and making our way to Lavastorm.  I joined up.

The leader starts leading us through Nek, and keeps asking
the group questions, sometimes repeating himself.  He asks
us if we're still following him okay, etc.  In the course
of just a minute or two, he starts getting apparently
psychotic, yelling at us for not properly communicating
with him, the group leader.

He finally yells, "DAMMIT, IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COMMUNICATE,
FORGET IT!", and he disbands the group.

About three minutes later, we all get sheepish tells
apologizing -- he had earlier turned off groupchat messages
in the "filter" options to avoid spammage during a
language-lesson session, and forgotten to turn it back on
when he formed our group...  He never saw any of the answers
we gave to all of his questions, and he had thought we were
just being unresponsive.
