For all the conversation going on here and the many long posts, I was
surprised to see no mention of what I found most memorable about EQ2.

I feel very much part of a story in EQ2.  I honestly felt immersed. Not
entirely in a good way, mind you.  My character is actually good-aligned,
but forced to start out in freeport. The squallor of the Scale Yard made
it so I hardly ever went back to my home if I didn't have to.  The
leafless trees made me actually sad.  And when I had to kill people who
were begging for mercy (because if I didn't, I couldn't enter Freeport), I
felt filthy. And SO ready to do the betrayal quest to get the hell out of
Dodge, err, Freeport.

Looking up, wherever I was, and seeing Lucan's citadel....the heat waves
under it...it compelled me to want to go there, yet I knew that if I was
to ever set foot there I'd probably be on my way to death. Or else I'd
have become a very corrupt person by then.

And the quest to becoming a cleric was rather apt too.  I honestly
expected to have to kill undead or run errands. But instead I was
submitted to Threshing...being purified through pain to become a cleric.
IE, mobs you can't fight will nuke/dot you and you just have to keep
yourself alive.

If you LET yourself immerse in the game, if you have it half a chance to
be a story and not a game, it will take you there.  Or has so far. I'm
only level 10, of course. ^_^

That being said, I said it was a story, not a world.  I dont' know yet if
it is a world, or if it will be, due to the way they control your fate so
much.  Stories are, by nature, not interactive.

In the end I will not be playing EQ2 for personal reasons, but I really
enjoyed those moments so far where I felt transported out of my home and
into Norrath.
