I would!!  Build a game that reaches a particular segment of the market 
and it will be ten times better than one that appeals to everyone a 
little but really meets the needs of few or none.  Not to hell with 
everyone else, to another game that is what they desire with everyone 
else.  Why must all games meet the lowest common denominator?  Why can't 
they be perfect games for some at the cost of alienating the very folks 
you are not trying to appeal to?  In fact then generic games that meet 
generic needs could have a niche of their own, where generic folks could 
have a generic good time as certainly some folks would prefer.

EQ is not an RPG because VI allowed the masses to make it so.  If Brad 
had said "you know, I don't care if half or more of the players who 
start out end up quitting, I am making the game I said I was gonna make, 
an RPG" rather than enlisting Furor as his lead designer, EQ would have 
been a much better game.  Of course it wouldn't have become the cash cow 
that it is today, but that's sometimes the price of quality.

I have little respect for Ben but can't help but agree with what he's 
saying in this thread.  By your reasoning developers should never make 
games that don't appeal to you rather than you not playing games that 
don't appeal to you.  That means that all any of us can ever play will 
be substandard games that appeal to the masses.  I want more and when it 
comes to gaming, less will result in more.  Try to be less things to 
less people and we can pick from 31 flavors of games, try to be all 
things to all people and we're all stuck with vanilla.
