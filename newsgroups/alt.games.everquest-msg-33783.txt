Rare spawns in Everfrost Martar Icebear (level 32) and Karg Icebear
(level 35). They're warriors, a little tough for their level. Both
drop the cloak everytime, sometimes Karg drops a nice 2hs weapon. I'd
guess Martar spawns every few hours and Karg about twice a day. You'll
probably need track to find them, since every Druid in the zone will
hunt them down as soon as they pop. But since you're a ranger...
