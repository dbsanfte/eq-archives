The fighting baton (8/20) is a weapon of lesser quality than your CoT. (11/25)
If you use a FB then use in primary hand for greater speed (ie. more damage
because striking more often)  and use CoT in offhand for greater damage because
it hits harder.

Your upgrade path should likely and most commonly be a Master Wu's Trance Stick
in primary (procs at 30)  and any of the following in offhand....Cane of
Harmony (12/25 and stats) Whitened Treant Fists (need to be 46 and able to go
to planes) ..14/25 or a Knuckle Duster  similar stats. The KD is the easiest
obtainable.  I prefer the Cane of Harmony over the KD because of the dual-staff
look (hate the cheesy KD graphic) and the stats (+4 str +4 dex and more)   The
"best" non-uber offhand is the Staff of Shielding from Chardok which is 17/28 I
think and procs a hp/ac buff.

Get the Wu's (3k-3.5k most servers) from City of Mist or buy it.  Sell one
CoT.  Watch things die fast and rejoice at 30 when the 86 HP DD spell thats
procing !
