You don't have to be a jester or an ass. You can find your own niche. For
example: dependable, competent or even just plain old friendly. But it
should be <your> effort expended to get what result you want and not a
collective requirement placed on everyone else.

I play in a rat shit timezone, but I am continually tuning down offers of
groups (becuase I don't want to get them killed). Of course if you choose to
play a Rogue from an odd timezone then your just asking for trouble as we
all know Murphy's Law clause 3a: which says the one thing you need is never
to be found.

If you can't do shit without a group it will seem you never have one. If a
group isn't needed it will seem one is always availible, yet the
availiability most proberly is the same in both instances.
