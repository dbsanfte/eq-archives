That's an honest answer, and I appreciate it, especially with the
last sentence added.

What I was aluding to was that the liberal democrats had 40 years to
completely screw up (and divide) our country in many ways, and now
it's the conservatives who have the power to try to set some things
differently.

See, the good thing is, if Bush/Republicans screw it up in a fashion
that the American people don't agree with, they'll be voted out.

Take environmental restrictions.  Many on the left want 'em tighter,
and you can't deny that there has been a wealth of environmental
laws passed in the last 40 years.  Many of which made some people
happy while completely screwing over some others.  Now, the others
have a chance to turn things around for them, which will make the
original group un-happy.  Know what? If enough Americans disagree
with the new changes, the folks that made the change will be voted
out and the new group voted in can "fix" what was broken.

The only way to stop this process is when somebody like Noriega
halts the back-and-forth swing of public opinion and makes his own
opinion the only one that matters from now to forever.  Then
what the people think doesn't matter.

That's what is going on in America right now.  Many, many (not all)
Americans haven't been happy with the directions the culture of
the country was heading, and since '94 they have been working
to change them (either in a different direction or back to the
way they were).  This is the first election since then that
cannot be argued with, and it's my opinion that the conservatives
should run with their own agenda and let the people decide in
a couple of years if it was the right one.

I mean, the only thing that would stop the process is Bush
declaring himself dictator and rolling the army out over the
American people...and if you truely believe that something
like that would happen (and that the troops would go along
with it) then I think somebody needs to up their dosage.

With the example of affirmative action:  Some things may soon
get changed...like law school admissions guidelines or
with hiring policies.  Black people are not going to be
sent back out to the fields, but some things may change.  If
enough Americans don't agree with the changes, they will
remedy the problem in the next election.  It's that simple.

What I believe really scares some libs is that most of America
_doesn't_ agree with them or their ideals, and they would
face a HUGE uphill battle to sway public opinion their way.
That's one of the reasons that libs like activist judges,
because instead of convincing 51% of the folks in Arkansas
that Gay Marriage is Great they just have to have one judge
who thinks it.  The same with many issues that libs hold
dear, like abortion, gun control, the death penalty,
environmental protections.

It's just how I see it.
