Ok, so once I get paid once, I have to add in groups of 4 now?  Both
times I got paid, I handed in just 1 though.  I'll try it again, but
my instincts will scream "save the game, he'll mess it up again" :-)

Small or large ore.  Generic ore I think.  The guy next to him has
some for sale, but it's very expensive (for me anyway).

Yes.  Up, down, left right, jumping, not jumping, etc.  The view was a
bit wierd at the surface, which is why I figured it was just a bug.
Ie, the ceiling color would flicker as I tried to move up, as if I
was continually having my viewpoint switch between under and above
water.
