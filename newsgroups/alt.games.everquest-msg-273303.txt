The mass exodus from EQ at the end of last year has resulted in a game I no
longer enjoy on my regular server. The game had been sliding for a very long
time but it was my friends that kept me going. Unfortunately for me I was
paying a year at a time, so my two accounts are still active for a few
months. When I log on, it's just sad to see the decline of population and
the emptiness that used to be a full friends list. I ended up starting over
on FV with a friend, it's helps to enjoy the game a bit as a newbie with no
twinking, back to the original eq.

However, we've kept the guild board running even though most of the guildies
have moved on to either WoW or EQ2. For a while at least we will be keeping
touch there, a good many of my friends were in our family type guild.
There's always the public board for communicating with non-guildie friends.
Hopefully when Vanguard comes out, we'll be reuniting for some hunting on
the same server.
