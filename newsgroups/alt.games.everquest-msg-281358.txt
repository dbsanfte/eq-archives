Once you have loaded the expansion, when you log onto EQ, it will prompt 
you. The command is /Claim x , x being a number, which depends on how many 
claims you have done before. Mine was /claim 4 and /claim 5, but like I 
said, just follow what EQ says and I believe on which ever character you 
type it, get's it.

Hope that helps!
