Best way to start Velious is to catch the boat from N Ro, and stay on the
island you land at after changing from the skiff to the Icebreaker.
Immediately you leave the dock turn left and follow the coast to the pirate
camp. There you should be able to group with one or at most two and take on
snow cougars. Be sure to pull one only, and to pull it to the camp or you'll
set up a train.

There's not enough room for kiting, but with care and by going invis with
superior camo to get from the dock to the camp you should be fine. If you
bind on the dock then you can port anywhere you want to and always gate back
to Iceclad. Don't even think of using the Iceclad portal, it just isn't
safe.
