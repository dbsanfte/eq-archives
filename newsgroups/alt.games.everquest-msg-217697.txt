its not all bad though, at least u can do it in stages, u dont have to stay
logged on for the full 6 hours as the whole lot comes in small packages.
plus when i first started (it was only a month ago), it didnt take as long
as the estimated time took, it gave an estrimate of eleven hours but i got
it done in five.
