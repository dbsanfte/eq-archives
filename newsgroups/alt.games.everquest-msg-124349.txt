Hmm, not so sure on that one.  On one night of XP grinding in the south
wing we picked up three (yes three) Bloodpoints.  These are those nice
little 10/21 piercers that sold for around 35K when Kunark was new.
We're still trying to sell them now at around 3K a piece, there just
doesn't seem to be the demand for them anymore.

Sash of the Dragonborn should still fetch a good 10K - not a very
common drop, however.  The Necklace of Superiority might have been uber
once, but you can get an item nearly as good from any WW dragon now,
including the wussy Yeldema.

Other than that, I can't really think of any "big cash" loot from HS.
Not since Velious and (especially) Luclin were opened, anyway.

You're right about the XP, though :)  One yellow of alt XP per hour is
possible in the south & east wings, and it's a fun dungeon to just
crawl through.
