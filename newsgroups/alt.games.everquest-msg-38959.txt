Heed my words well brothers and sisters!  Spread this word far and wide!!!
There is a guild being formed whos sole reason for being is to RIP YOU OFF!!
They are forming a guild named Collective of Dark Honour and the only thing
this guild is about is taking money from members in the guise of being a
guild bank.  They have had a long discussion on the methods and means to
take money from others and keep it in appearence of being legit and this is
it.  I was not a victim of this... I was asked to be a part of it.  I could
not in good conscience participate in this since I do not want to have my
account banned.  Their web sight is http://www.kameelyon.com/collective/
and while it will sound all decent, the required tithes are going to be
going to their pockets.  Be on the lookout for these names as well:
Grimguard Dirtnappin, Valdrada, Meeii Low, Fawn Ratajczyk, Xohdas
Brainteaser, Eleena Transient, Vartanus Legna, Ommnoka.  All of these people
have openly stated that this is their intention.
