Ducking (crouching) used to be a sure fire way of interrupting your
cast when I played EQ, and probably still is.  Moving didn't always
interrupt, but ducking was guaranteed.  As I recall you might burn a
little mana that way, but you could save a bundle.  It was also useful
when I was in the middle of casting a blast on some mob and suddenly
realized that it was the wrong mob for some reason, and desperately
wanted to avoid hitting it.  It's well worth learning... I got to the
point where I just did it automatically (and instantly) if needed.

No one is going to shoot you.  It's too bad when you run into a crummy
teammate, although some of my best LDoN wins came despite bad members.
It was like the game had thrown up an extra obstacle, and we won
anyway.  One time, we had a jerk tell us that "this group sucks" and
leave after we wiped in the middle of the LDoN.  Turned out we moved
faster w/o him and ended up winning.  So the best thing may be to
ignore / drop somebody who is really causing a problem,  and then just
fight on against the odds.
