Can she get a decent group together?  If so, there are several options.
There is a Twilight Sea cleric quest armor that is better than hers by a
fair amount.

Breastplate of the Holy Rite
+21 AC +5 Str +3 Dex +8 Wis +2 vsMg +2 vsFire +2 vsCold +10 HP +20 Mana
+6.50 Wt   The Twilight Sea  None 45


I might add, that I am still wearing acrylia studded, have not managed to
get one of the better ones yet, due to terminal brokeness, and not getting
the drops in HoT or Thurgadin.
