Thank you!  That was a most entertaining read.

As for your query regarding announcing the intent to mesmerize...
I used to see it a lot in pickup groups, where you often have no
idea just how disciplined your comrades will be in combat.  When
I've been with frequent companions and/or guildmates it's been
rare to non-existant.  Everybody knows their role, and an important
part of the role of the "main assist" (MA) is to quickly choose
and announce the target for the damage dealers, while it is
assumed that whoever is responsible for "crowd control" (usually
an Enchanter, if present) will deal appropriately with any other
enemies.  Circumstances vary, and some enemies are immune to
mesmerization (as you learned), so group communication is important,
but a well disciplined group confident of one another's skills and
judgement simply doesn't need to be informed as to which enemies
you are going to mesmerize, they already know.
