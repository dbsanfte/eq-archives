I don't believe that's possible.  The game keeps track of your prices by
using the item ID, not the individual item, and thus can't distinguish
between two separate instances.  At least, that was my understanding.  It's
helpful in the very least because if I'm selling 15 stacks of leather
padding or something, I don't need to put a price per pad on each stack
individually.
