It was probably right around that same time that I started seeing a real
problem with packet loss.  It is random, and gets very bad at times, rarely
disconnects.  I have had the same problem with three different ISPs.  Two
dial up, and my current wireless ISP.  Latency stays pretty consistent, 200
to 300 with the dial up, 80 to 140 with the wireless.  Packet loss seems to
be identical between all three, and when I am grouped with people, they
often see exactly the same spikes of packet loss that I see, so I tend to
discount the ISP being the problem.  Sure, the problem could be somewhere in
the backbone, but it's been quite consistent for quite a few weeks now, so I
tend to believe the issue is on Verant's side.  As for the original
complaint in this thread, probably not related to these issues, bizbee
pointed out that he thought he heard something about a cable being damaged
in the Pacific, that could be the problem there.
