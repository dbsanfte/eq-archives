Bah!  Oh well, at least I'm keeping with the grammar flame tradition. :)

True enough.  I was having a hard time justifying a grammar flame here, 
but decided I really wanted to, and that would just have to be reason 
enough. :) That particular misspelling is just high on the pet peeve 
list, I guess, right after 'definately' for 'definitely'.

I never spell check, though.  I've noticed that people who spell check a 
lot are much more likely to end up with weird word substitutions, because 
they don't check their work as they go, since they're sure the checker 
will make it all good for them.

That has to be a run-on.  Good thing I don't grammar check either. :)

}I will make a concerted effort to

Weird.  I went to m-w.com to look up 'cromulent', and netscape crashed.  
That must be a pretty vicious word, there... Hm.  It's not from Vonnegut, 
now there's a suprise. :)
