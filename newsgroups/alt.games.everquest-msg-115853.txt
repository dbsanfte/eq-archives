>snip pet stupidity

I can only assume you are talking about necro pets, and if you aren't then I
can tell you that Necro pets are just as bad.  Mine keeps wandering off and
I lose him.  Then when I'm ready to fight he is nowhere to be found.  Stupid
skellie. Then I have to go looking for him.  By the time I find him, the MOB
is gone and off we go again.  Even looking back every few minutes to make
sure he's there doesn't work.  Sometimes he slips off really fast.  Maybe
chasing some cute girl skeleton. Gheeez!

I didn't really pay attention to what they conned so I don't know if there
is a connection there.  I've tried everything.  /pet guard me    /pet guard
here   /pet back off etc...   I guess next is /pet stick to me like glue

Baby necro holds head in hands and weeps
