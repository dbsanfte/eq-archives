For starters, that loot is part yours. Work looting rules with your group- 
a simple "loot until a belt or pad, alphabetical, split off, roll for good 
stuff, ok?" will ensure this. Those belts leveled my wood elf druid quite 
well.

60 plat huh? Well, for starters, make sure you get your 14 level spells 
saved for... then I would try for some armor, perhaps your first bits of 
WIS gear. For armor your goal should be AC instead of stats at this level. 
Also, make sure you have plenty of bags. I would invest in a 6 slot 10% 
weight reduction bag (tailored by players- 10 plat) and a few Large Bags- 
when you are soloing (which would be Level 14), the reduced amount of trips 
to sell your haul will ensure quicker leveling and good money making.
