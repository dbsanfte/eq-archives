I'm not a gnome, but this advice does apply to us halflings too...
Figures that I've been ganking inkies and am deeply KoS to them now...
hmmm... perhaps go slaughter sisters of erollisi?...
Although I've been permanently dubious in paineel, even with a level or so
in the warrens.

Even though AC is the most important, if you have a choice between, say, 5
ac straight or 3 ac and some stats or saves, go for the stats or saves,
especially MR, god I hate caster mobs...

And yes, We do make great Warriors, even if it seems odd at first, my 35th
level friend, a fellow halfling Warrior, was invited to come fight in Old
Sebilis (!!!), although, he doesn't have a key so he didn't go.
