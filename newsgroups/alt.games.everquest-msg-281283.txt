There's no sub and no modules to buy. Just the one box on the shelf/in
basket of your favourite retailer. There's an expansion "early 2006"
but knowing how mmog timescale slip that could be any time in 2006!
Just don't get GW expecting a full on mmorpg. Mmorpg-lite with a
massive dose of PvP is a good way of putting it.
