Hmm, so your response is that despite being shown to have posted
misinformation you insist you were correct.  That stubbornness bit you
have here is your way of explaining how you arrived at this conclusion I
take it?  Even the map you egregiously posted here clearly shows that
you were wrong rather than support your contention,  your own evidence
does not support your claims.  Since the facts as you describe them are
physically impossible there is absolutely no chance that you were
correct, no need to continue to assert otherwise.  You were wrong.  Its
not the end of the world, but it is an opportunity for you to learn 
from your mistakes.  Don't post things that you make up as fact.  If you
have to post at all, try to stick to actual things you know about, not
things you've read about on web sites.
