Even if you have to be 60 to get a group in CT, you do *not* need to be in
any sort of uber guild to do the camps.  Level 60 isn't like loot.. its a
target ANYBODY can and will achieve.

As to the 3 person maze groups, well the 2 i've seen is 60 monk, 60 chanter,
60 cleric (all 1 person)
And 60 monk, 60 shaman, 60 cleric (all me)

I can't speak for the other person (its a guildie, but i don't know their
cleric/chanter AA or gear)
For me tho, I think you will be slightly surprised.   All level 60, yes.
But gear nowhere like you would expect on my alts.

Yes my monk has a shitload of AA skills, some nice loot (only the BP and
necklace from nToV though) but as far as my shaman and cleric go... -

Cleric has 8 AA levels.. thats run speed 3, innate wisdom 3, and mental
clarity 1.  Thats almost a zero effect to the group (1 extra mana regen/tick
only)

He is in full Thurg quested gear, a neck from WW dragons (the kind of
dragons that can be solod) - that is as far from uber as you can get.

My shaman.. level 60, 5 AA skills (run speed 3, and 2 un-used).  As far as
his gear goes, I would describe it as very poor for a level 60.. you may or
may not agree, I'll post the list.   If your not familiar with shm gear,
hopefully graeme or somebody else can add something useful :)

Did you have adds?  Believe me any group, uber or not, would get their asses
kicked on a big CT pull. 5 mobs and a well balanced group is getting ownt

The same kind of gear that my cleric and shaman wear.   If you guys had
small managable pulls, then I really can't understand how 2 groups wiped
there.  I guarantee your warrior MA had more HP than me (uber gear or not),
im only a monk at the end of the day, and im only at 5.5khp or so buffed

rarity != difficulty

On Prexus, yeah.   There has to be a cut-off point somewhere.. and for me CT
or Vindi would be it.

Then I wish I was on your server!   Remember Prexus is the oldest unsplit
server - we have 4 guilds battling over SSRA every patch day.. and thats the
ultra high end game.

Yes there are a lot of small guilds on Prexus, but there are also OVER ten
guilds who can kill Vindi.  Add alliances into that, and I bet the figure is
15-20.

Of course something thats killed so often and by so many people on my server
is going to be seen as trivial - whether the same holds true for other
servers or not.

A common number amongst the general prexian public is that there are 4
"uber" guilds.. well if theres 15 guilds capable of killing Vindi/CT.. thats
a LOT of non-uber people who have the mana cap within their reach

It is hard to do, yes. But, it isnt something thats exclusive to "uber
guild" people (reaching the mana cap, I mean)

I personally would never get close to the mana cap on any of my alts.. but
thats because a) im lazy to gear chars  b) they arent my mains.   c) its not
important to me
