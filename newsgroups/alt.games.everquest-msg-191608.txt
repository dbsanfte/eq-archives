That, is undobutably what the developers had in mind! :) Glad you
enjoy it so much. And what's wrong with that?

Would you look at a guy that spends every weekend on the gold course
dedicating his time and effort to perfecting his swing as needing a
life? How about the guy that dedicates his every minute to his job??
Does that make him wrong? Does that make him less of a person?

To the judgemental amongst us perhaps it does. I for one am not that
judgemental. I say what ever pulls your trigger. I just like seeing
people who can honestly enjoy themselves. My Dad died poor as a church
mouse... hardly had enough money to bury him properly. Know what wehas
put on his headstone?

"I enjoied making money, I enjoied spending money. I have no regrets."

That was the last line in the last letter he sent to my sister the
night before the surgery that eventually took his life. I can't say it
any better than that. 

Enjoy yourself cause life's too short not to!!!
