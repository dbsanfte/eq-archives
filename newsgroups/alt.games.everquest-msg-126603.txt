I tried it out, worked just fine for me.

I did notice a lot more lagging while in the invatory and spell windows.
Also, it is slow on highlighting the hot keys when trying to set them up.
I figure these issues will be worked out a bit more before it goes live.  A
faulty GUI will be more trouble than it is worth.  I figure 3 weeks yet at
the outside before live gets it.
