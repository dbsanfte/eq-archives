Hi,

I am trying to tailor a robe, but i keep getting the message that i
cannot combine these items in this container, or something similar,
i'm trying to combine spider silk and the robe pattern in a large
sewing kit, does anyone know what it takes? i have 3 spider silks in
there by the way.

/Regards Berth
