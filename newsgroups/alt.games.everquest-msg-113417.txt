Monk and lots of things.  It is scary how well monks pair up with so
many other classes so well, including non healers.  For your purposes
the monk works well because you can pull with the monk and never bring
agro to the other char unintentionally by FDing away extra mobs.  I've
played around a bit with my monk and a shaman or druid and done well
with the buffs and heals, but for something really scary I teamed up the
monk with an enchanter.  With just haste and slow spells it actually
seemed faster than partnering with a healer so long as I avoided
casters.  One good poison spell at  the wrong time can really cause an
issue with that grouping though heh.

Beyond the classes to group keep in mind that if others ask you to join
them or to join with you at the very least you should warn them you are
dual boxing, though personally I prefer to only do this when alone if I
can.  Group tactics and responsibilities require your full attention and
risking someone else's life on your skills at dual boxing should at
least have their approval before  you try it.
