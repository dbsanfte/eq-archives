Yes, the 'vic' was dumb.  The person who put the item up for sale at 
that price, obviously hoping for a sucker, was a deceitful bastard.  He 
was hoping for someone to buy it, and when they did, bragged about it.  
It was not like he was selling bone chips at 100000pp to transfer funds 
when they could not meet in-game.  No, he was taking advantage of 
someone else's lack of sleep, stupidity, need, etc.  So he was preying 
on them.  That makes his actions immoral.  In some ways, not advertising 
them was an even worse scam because if he had advertised, others would 
have seen it for the scam it was.  

Keeping quiet about it condones the actions and makes you almost as 
guilty.  The fact that the guild thinks it was "cool", "funny" or 
anything other than reprehensible, says that that guild is not worth 
being a member of.
