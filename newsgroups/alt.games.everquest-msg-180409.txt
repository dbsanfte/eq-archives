The way I understand it is that each proc (be it a part of the weapon or a
spell or whatever) has a timer in it, and the proc check goes off once for
each timer.  Different procs have different timers, which leads to the
checks succeeding more often statistically.

The checks appear to be somewhat dex based, which would explain higher dex
leading to more procs.

I've had Call of Sky go off even when i was out of range or couldn't see my
target, so you don't have to make a successful hit for the check to succeed.

Primal was at one time end game equipment (and still makes me drool).  It
doesn't surprise me that they proc like mad.
