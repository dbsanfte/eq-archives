Of course contractions are abbreviations. There is no "technical" meaning
for abbreviation other than a word that has been abbreviated.

You do not have a definiton of a "technical meaning" for abbreviation, that
precludes "bus" being an abbreviation. If you do, then post it.

I'm trying to understand where you get the idea that an "abbreviation" has
some other meaning other than a shortened or contracted form of a word or
phrase. As if there is some master list of abbreviations from which none of
must stray.

I can't believe you seriously have the nerve to refer to anyone in this
newsgroup as dense, especially when referring to English usage.
