I am not asking for your cd-key! Let me just get that out. Second thing, you
prob'ly won't be able to help me, but I may as well try.
For some reason that I cannot figure out, my CD-KEY does not work! I bought
the game yesterday, and have been trying to install it today.
I got the package, which contains the cd "Everquest The Ruins of Kunark" and
"Everquest The Scars of Velious".
So I put in the first one I mentioned, and download all the patches. I read
through the manual, and check out the tutorial.
Finally, I start setting up my Account. I complete the first couple screens
fine, but I get stuck on the last one.
First off, I am trying to use the numbers/letter combination that is on a
sticker on the top right of the cd case for "Everquest Ruins of Kunark" (is
this the one I should be using??)
I type all my other account stuff, then press enter.
First screen comes up and checks to make sure I am not trying to update an
account with this cd-key, and am actually making a new one. I hit enter, it
keeps going.
Next screen pops up and says something like "Error 0036: Invalid Account
Number. Check to make sure you are typing it right" Or something to the
effect.
Now, I am sure I have typed it in right. I have tried it at least a dozen
times. ALSO, I tried using the cd-key for the other cd, but it said it was
for updating purposes only.
Please somebody help me, or direct me to where I can get help. This is
really annoying, especially when I am not really understanding why it won't
work. I just hope I don't have to mail it to the Everquest company or
something. That would be a real bother.
Oh well, thanx in advance for any help.
Chaos
