Not sure if there's a manual for the LoY features. If there is, I
haven't found one. By how the mapping was explained, you can either
set it to mark one point, move to the next and mark it, then draw a
line between the two or to draw a line as you run. Could be wrong,
though.

Armor tinting: You need vials of prismatic dye for each slot you want
to tint. It's the SLOT that's tinted, not the actual piece of armor.
So, if you dye your chest slot red, anything you wear in the chest
slot will be read whether it's Lambent, Black Alloy, or leather. Info
on making the dyes can be found at eqtraders.com. With 115 charisma,
it will cost about 28-30pp per slot, not counting failures at making
the dyes. Making the dyes requires pottery and brewing, both trivials
are at no more than 70, but I'd recommend having both skills to at
least 120. Applying the dye takes no skill, though. Alternately, you
can buy dyes off players in the Bazaar usually, ranging anywhere from
40-75pp per vial.

As for the other features, just need to open the appropriate window
for them (alt-w to bring up your window selector bar). They're mostly
self-explainatory.

>And where are the new zones?

Have to go through Stonebrunt to get to them. The dock now has a boat
docked at it. Click on the door of the boat to get to Gunthak Harbor.

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ has a section on zone info.
http://eq-toolbox.com/ has pre-made maps for most zones for the
cartography tool by the way.

It's no more difficult than it's ever been. You're probably only
having so much trouble because it's new territory for you. Once you
become familiar with it, it shouldn't be a problem.
