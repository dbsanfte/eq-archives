A friend of mine has been trying to buy the EQ Gold trilogy pack in
the UK for several weeks now.  Initially he bought it from a shop, but
the keys had already been used so he had to take it back.  The shop
evidently didn't have another copy, because he then ordered it from a
web site.  After 2 weeks they have canceled the order, because they
cannot get hold of it.

I had a similar problem when I wanted to buy a second copy a while
back, but then SOE came to the rescue with the free trial email.  Have
Sony stopped production in favour of getting zillions of copies of
Planes of Power ready?  Does anyone know of a reliable UK source of EQ
Gold?  I have to get this guy into the game before he gets totally
pissed off with waiting.
