Hmm, at least is said they were down at some stage.

To clarify, what I was looking for was a page that gave server status,
like the above unlike the two pages other poster listed and was correct.

So I guess the search for an accurate server status page is still on
then. 

Personally I've found any page at station.sony.com to be like "a crap
shoot" to borrow a colloquialism (sp?).

I suspect that most of these pages just use a ping test, which just
tells you that it is powered on.

In our household, we have the jargon "comparative base sample. I'm
