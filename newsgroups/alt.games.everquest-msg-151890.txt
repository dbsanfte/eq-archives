    Assumption correct.

    Assumption correct.

    And green goblin skins. The salts stack, last time I checked the skins
do not.

    A warrior that did this quest in my guild had a route he'd follow in
Nurga where he'd basically clear the entire dungeon, just himself. Don't
know if he was using a trick like Earthshaker or just flat-out beating on
stuff. I don't think he had a second box with him. After one cycle of the
route, stuff would be repopped for the next cycle - it took him between 30
mins and an hour per cycle. It took him 30 cycles to go from typical KOS
faction to ally and able to do the quest.

    Not likely. Nobody goes there to get this stuff for resale - they only
go there to power up faction, and use the salts themselves. You'll have to
grind through it.

    Important point: the faction, amazing as it may seem, is not the
bottleneck on the quest. Drusella and one of the goblins you have to kill
are. Drusella is now a highly contested mob, like Yael is because of the
SotE quest. If you can't get her on server-up (and because of your time zone
I bet you could), you really have to work to find out when she's being
killed as guilds can and will time-lock her.

    Depends on what you call "better". From your Magelo I don't see an AoB
item on you, and either slot that you put it in (shoulders or wrist) it'll
give you 40+ HPs. Whether you can make that up in VT, especially the AoB, is
between you and however DH awards loot. ;-) There are 100 HP options in
wrists (Ring of Slime) and shoulder (SotE) that don't involve killing
millions of greens, but I don't know if your guild would be able to help you
get those. Oh, and don't discount the small bonus from upgrading from your
Emperor key to the second Chardok ring!
