Let's just face the fact that if you have a low to mid level pc (and even
some high-end ones), about the only way you are going to get Luclin to run
smoothly is to turn all the options waaaay down or completely off.  I
personally don't like playing with no 3d sky, clipping plane turned all way
down, no social animations, no lighting, low res, min char models, etc.  I
love Eq and will continue to explore Luclin...but this has put a damper on
my enjoyment of the game.
