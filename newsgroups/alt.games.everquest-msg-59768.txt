Dragon Kill Points

The theory is simple, in practice it's sometimes a hassle, but our
website was created inhouse from raw code, so can be tailored to a lot
of the donkey work. Logs are taken at raids, fed into a parser which
automatically adjusts PC totals, feed in the drops to account for them,
etc.

>Does anyone ever want no-drop items?

There are less than half a dozen dropable items anyone in the guild
would want for primaries. Everything is no-drop just about.

>Do you price them on the fly?

Most items are pre-priced going into the raid. New drops are priced on
the fly, then fixed after the raid. Retroactive adjustments are rarely
needed.

>  I don't know, how does it work?  

Show up to a raid, and you get the points allocated to that raid.
Something drops that you want, you pay a set number of points for the
item. More than 1 person wants an item, bidding ensues. Afterlife and a
few other guilds have their own systems which we adapted for our own
use. Various nuances have been added for our specific needs and goals,
but the premise is basically the same: Awards based on attendance.

NBG is by honour. You want an item best suited to someone else, go for
it by the rules, but expect to be frowned upon for being so greedy. Suer
there are drawbacks to every system, but this has almost totally
eradicated loot bitching. If people complain, they know the rules
beforehand, so find another guild if they don't agree, or suggest
amendments for the guild as a whole to debate.

An ideal situation would be a perfectly unbais loot-awarder, but as well
as friendship ALWAYS having a bearing (we're all human), NBG depends
100% on your personal standpoint. As a warrior and MT, I should get the
highest AC items, the most HP items, and the best weapons, right? Give
the mana items to the clerics to keep me standing, and everyone else
should just show up to equip ME! BZZZT! It's simply impossible to please
everyone with definitions of 'best class' for a multiclass item. Then,
even if you do manage to agree XXXX plate BP (100ac 200hp/mana
20stats/resists 5hp/mana regen 50% haste) is best for a warrior, what
does the cleric say (who has been at every raid for 6 months and seen 20
drop) when the newly joined warrior gets one on his first raid?

We had loot awarding before, and it led to resentment. We're now trying
DKPs and although we're constantly tweaking, it seems to be working
better. As a player and MT, I actually lose out with a DKP system. As an
officer, I gain because there are hardly any loot disputes. I don't
really like the system, but can see it's the lesser of 2 evils.

>What do you guys do with loot gathered in exp groups, both mixed and
>guild-only? 

Very little that people want anything that can be gathered without a
raid. Kael orbs, Willsapper and Lodizal shields are priced for example,
and if you get one with guild help, you are expected to pay, but each
occurrence is an officer judgement call really. No set rules and it
hasn't happened yet. I doubt anyone would get a pickup group for those
kinda things anyway. Fungi tunics, PSCs, Chitin stuff, WW drops etc.
goten in exp groups are yours for the taking, even if the whole group is
guildies.

> Anyone up for a loot-distribution discussion at the
>higher end game?  

Been there, done that, got a wardrobe full of t-shirts...

>It seems to be the cause of most guild problems, I
>see it popping up on every board, is it really that hot a topic?

EQ is very much an item driven game. Especially once you're L60. It's
the primary way of improving your character, and unlocking previously
unavailable areas and experiences.
