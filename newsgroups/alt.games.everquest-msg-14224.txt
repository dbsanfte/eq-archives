Slide over to the Torvonnilous message boards for an example of this. 
Someone(trusted) had a number of guild passwords,  he had them in his
play notebook,  a friend of his, came over snuck a peak at the

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
