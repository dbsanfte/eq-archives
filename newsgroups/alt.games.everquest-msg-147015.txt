/agree

Even the lvl 8 Fear on my baby Necro seems to not only stick 90% of the
time, but last for full or near full duration... against even cons at 15.
This is my 3rd or 4th attempt at a Necro and I'm pretty sure the reason I
kept giving up on them is because I couldn't get the low level Fear to land
often enough for my taste.
