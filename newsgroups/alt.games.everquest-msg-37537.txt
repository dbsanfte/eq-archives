Hopefully never, and they will think of something useful.

It is probably the worst idea for an enhancement I can think of... because
it simply does not address the problem as it is... but rather as they
perceive it.

This was a sarcastic point of mine.  And you proved it...

Anti-Gates are not helpful to the problem of wizards being preceived as
useless.  They don't help most wizards.  They don't raise us on the list of
casters to invite to your group.  I have a screen shot of a bout of text I
had where I was trying to get into a group... and someone else was trying to
get a port.  The group said "no thanks we're looking for [anything else]."
and the port never responded to my /tell, but changed his auction to "WTB
port to Steamfont. ONLY!"

> >I'd say you're wasting your breath (fingers?).

I said it before, I'll say it here too... thank you for reinforcing this
point of mine.

I'll waste my time reitterating my points... for the benefit of others
(hopefully wizards who are depressed at your obvious lack of understanding).

> >Wizards are fight enders...

Only if played poorly.

A talanted or skilled wizard saves down time... and in certain circumstances
A LOT of down time (like the down time that the whole party would have to
have to do a 6 person corpse run).  Think I'm innaccurate, I'll regale you
of tales where 80-95% of my mana was the difference between 5 corpse runs
(I'd have gated... the cleric was trying but out of mana) and lots of "You
have gained party experience" messages.

Make two groups sometime... side by side.  Identical make up, except one
will have a Wizard, the other have a Warrior (of the same level) in his
place.  Let's see who has less down time... and who get more exp with the
same type of pulls.  Now when I say warrior in the wizard's place, the
wizard's group WILL have tanks in it too... I am not saying that we replace
tanks... I'm saying we are very usefull as fire support to groups.

The warrior group will, hands down... if all the players are 733t |)3 \/\/
|)z <vomit>... also, the wizzie <vomit> will have done at least two corpse
runs.

If however, the players are people who you would actually WANT in your
guild... The wizard group will pull 20-50% more mobs in the same time. And
the Wizard will likely never go below half health.

You seem to share Verants view that wizards need help only in the high end
game (by the time MOST people [yourself excluded] have figured out just how
useful we really are).

You, however, also reinforce (or perhaps even CREATE) the ACTUAL problem...
that we have a hard time getting groups throughout our careers (ALL LEVELS)
because we are not preceived as useful.

Uh, no... that would be cooling... reloading... aiming... shifting
position...
Or do you mean you've never checked?
Or do you mean that you haven't a clue what I'm talking about?
It's an analogy, not an example.

PS If you think I'm being harsh... why don't you respond to someone saying
your class (that you actually take pride in playing well) is useless... oh
wait, you're not a wizard... no one does say your class is useless.

PPS Yes, I pick on bards... but I NEVER said they were useless.

PPPS It just dawned on me, Sang has never encountered a well played
wizard... probably because he had experiences with BLAST BLAST BLAST School
Wizards, and vowed never to group with another.  Though it may also be that
he is simply unobservant of what the wizard was actually doing.  No, if a
wizard doesn't jump right up and start emptying his mana bar at the onset of
a fight, it does NOT mean he isn't doing anything.  If he DOES... then, yes
he's going to make a lot of down time... but that's not how you play a
wizard smartly.  Assholes who insist wizards are useless and therefore don't
invite them into groups, cause wizards to hunt solo, or in tandem, were
emptying our mana into a target IS the ONLY way to fight... that actually
CAUSES wizards to slip into BLAST BLAST BLAST when in a group, because they
haven't enough experience with groups (thank you asshole) to know better.

rangerpet: "Hey!  Ease off on the nukes... give the dot time to work."
me: "You have a SUN O/S system helping us fight?"
rangerpet: "???"
me: "You know 'We're the dot in dot com' "
rangetpet: "No, not dot.  DOT."
me: "DOT???"
rangerpet: "Damage Over Time!  It takes time for it to do all of it's
damage.  Let it work, then blast."
me: "Oh, sorry, so used to soloing I forget that other people are doing
damage."
rangerpet: "You should group more."
me: "I would, but lately I only have an hour or two to play at a time... and
don't feel like wasting it trying to get in a group just in time to log
off."

(average time LFG... 1.5 hours per attempt)
