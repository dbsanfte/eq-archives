Saw it yesterday, made it a family holiday, even took the kids out of
school.  Well if LOTR isn't worth all that I don't know what is.  We had a
blast, the movie was amazing.

My favorite OMG! scene was when the elves showed up at Helms Deep.  Amazing,
how they really captured that magical feeling of the elves.

Could have done with a little less making the dwarf look goofy,Gimli should
be more than comic relief(kind a reminded me of JarJar Binks), although I
loved the box comment.

LOTR is more than just a movie, it's really a visual, emotional experience.
I felt like I'd just been on some amazing amusement park ride.

We saw the first one 4 times, I think we'll see this one at least that many
times, and with the holiday approaching the kids won't have to miss any more
school.

Oh, by the way, just in case I haven't used the word amazing enough in this
post......AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING etc.......
