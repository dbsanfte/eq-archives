A couple of weeks ago, I was hoofing it through Great Divide when I saw
"/ooc 32 Ranger LFG".  I thought to myself, "Man, what's a noob like that
doing LFG in this zone?"  Then I remembered... *I* was that newb.  When I
was 28, I was standing underneath the waterfalls saying "28 Cleric  LFG".

So yeah, sometimes we forget our origins.  If I strain, I can remember when
I thought 50+ folks were gods, and level 30 an impossibly high level to
obtain.  Heck, I remember when I thought level 20 folks were uber doods.  I
remember fighting skeletons around the pyramid in Neriak, and when a mummy
spawned, I /ooc'd asking someone to come kill it.  A wizzie came by and
nuked it one shot.  I was in awe.

At times I have to forcibly remind myself that the guy who just turned 50 is
not a noob.  I have to remember that chanters who can't Dire Charm or KEI
are still useful, that Shamans without epics are still darned useful in a
group.

It *is* easy to get jaded.  It *is* easy to forget that first time through,
when you went completely untwinked and every plat was precious.

What I struggle to do - with fair success, I think - is to suppress that
first impulse to sneer "noob" at the person who shouts to the zone, "Ding
50!".  To treat with respect those who have struggled just as hard as I did
to get where they are.  It makes for a better gaming experience all around -
for myself as well as them.
