F9 to change camera angles.

F10 to toggle the chat and other windows on and off so you can get a
clear view.

Print Screen to do a screen capture (this puts the image into the
windows clipboard) and you still need to open a paint program and do a
paste (taking the image from the windows clip board and copying it to
the paint program) and save the resulting picture to a file.

The live servers still retain this function. Not sure for how much
longer, next patch may break it :-)
