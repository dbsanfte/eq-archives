I'd like to see arrows or thrown weapons have a 50%
(or whatever) chance of ending up in the mob's inventory
if you hit them with it.  This would represent projectile
weapons that got stuck in the creature and were still
in good enough shape to reuse after pulling from the
corpse.

And I can't see why it would be at all hard to code.
