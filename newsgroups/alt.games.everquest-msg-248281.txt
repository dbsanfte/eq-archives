*strange look*

You are kidding, right?  I mean, it would be pretty obvious that stuns and
debuffs would count as engaging a mob.  Almost certainly they would base it
on whether the mob AI is in "aggro" state, or "patrol" state.  Code to
determine whether the mob has a single point of damage would seem stupid.
Even before you consider what might happen with cleric type mobs under such
a scheme...

Horizons allows this, and it doesn't work out badly at all.

Dryads have very caster based beginning stats, and thier racial bonuses
would help a spellcaster more than a melee.  Between those advantages, very
few players take the odd combination of a Dryad Chaos Warrior.   Which in
turn, makes my character rare, and pretty fun to play.

There are so many gnome / elf warriors in EQ because the racial and stat
bonuses are completely meaningless.  Well balanced, such characters would be
playable, but rare, since it would be slightly to somewhat advanatagous to
take a more "warlike" race.

Good.   The faction system in EQ was stupid most of the time.

If they make the mistake of putting Feign Death in the same way, they would
deserve it.

IOW, how about waiting until we actually see how it works before announcing
that the sky is falling?
