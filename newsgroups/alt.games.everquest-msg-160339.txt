You are right he was a halfling ,but he did tell me 114 which I am now
thinking it was a type O and he did mean 214. I am sitting with a 140 wis
and thought it was pretty good for my lvl. I have replace my equiptment
based on wis, mana and hp and just found out from a friend that I should
forget hp and go with effects instead. I don't have another toon to make
plat for my cleric so she has done it all on her own. So is 140 wis. about
right for her at lvl 36 or should it be higher? Thanks
