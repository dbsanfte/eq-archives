A thousand monkeys banging on keyboards posted the following under the
name "John Stewart" <jvstewart@webjudo.net>:

Your word power is as overwhelming as your intellect. Maybe you think
if you repeat the same thing over and over it sounds smarter? Well,
you don't. You're nothing more than a protosimian who got a flat on
the evolutionary highway.


> Thanks for identifying yourselves.  Im sure you folks think you
>comprise most of the newsgroup.  Ya that makes sense.  Please keep posting
>your soooo enlightening me.  Every time you post you speak volumes.

Same with you, monkey.


>Its interesting what people use so harshly on others is what they are afraid
>of themselves.

Your hypocricy is astounding. Or do you think that only applies to
those you are mindlessly throwing dung at?


>  They reach back into their minds and hearts to find the
>worse thing they can think of and blast you with it.  Are arrogant scorning
>and character assinations what your greatest fears are?

Is English your second language or are you as stupid as you sound?


>  Let me help you out
>with that dude.  You see when someone assinates your character others
>silently look on and view that person as a real dick.

Yeah, well guess what; the silent majority can kiss my ass. But in
reality, when people like yourself suddenly seem to need to claim the
support of the silent majority, its because they know they're fucked.


>  And when you bravely
>face it others look on and view you as a hero.  At least to some degree.
>Does that help you?  I hope so!

It helps me understand what a complete loser you are, monkey.

Why don't you just slink away now?

"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
