"GameSpy: What level of characters will the dungeon be designed for? 

Alan Vancouvering: Deepest Guk, along with all of the lost dungeons, 
supports groups of levels 20 to 65. Each theme has a huge range of monsters 
and adventure types available. The Wayfarers Brotherhood, which is the 
group that has unearthed information about the possible locations of the 
lost depths of Guk, offers adventures for any group in that level range."
