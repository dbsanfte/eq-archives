Having started both a High Elf Fighter, based in Castleview Hamlet, and a
Half Elf Scout, based in Willow Woods, I can tell you that it may not be The
Down Below.  The High Elf did have to collect from The Down Below, however
the Scout had to collect from The Forest Ruins.  Each starting town's
location is different and it is communicated at the time the quest is given,
likely stored in the Journal as well.  Wherever you have to go, simply kill
random beasties in that zone and you will eventually (rather quickly)
collect the tokens you need.

Based on this I would also venture to guess that the zone where you will
find your individual tokens will be directly connected to your home zone.
