It isnt a bug of the 8th ring quest itself, it is the broken pathing in the
fort. When you pull out the mobs from the left or right room they run into
the wall left or right to the door and do that til they turn off from you
(deathwalk or fear or aggro from behind). Btw. I did my 8th last friday
without some problems, we snared the chief to avoid he runs out of the
building to the giant.
