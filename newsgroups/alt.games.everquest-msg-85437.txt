I know where you can do it for free. :-)
Go to Grieg's End. After you zone in, clear the first room and turn a
u-turn to the left. Clear a short hall and the small room you come to
next. There's a door on the opposite side of the room that opens onto a
short set of steps and a right turn into a short hall. (Leads to the
first outdoor courtyard.)  As near as we can tell, that door out of the
last room is a "trap door". EVERY time you open it, a mob spawns in the
short hallway beyond. Once you get the timing of the room pops down, you
can pull as many or as few mobs from the hall, one at a time, as you are
comfortable pulling. Hell of a place to grind xp, though we never saw
any loot to write home about.  All mobs were blue at 52, as I recall.
