Yep, but the difference between my old dodge van that got 12 mpg and 
both my F150s that get 18mpg (both measured by me driving around as I 
normally do, not by the sticker) is 33%.  Comparing to an old friend's 
chevy sprint (three cylinder motorcycle engine in a light economy car 
frame) which got 55 mpg, both are laughable.  I have to have an F150 at 
a minimum for business purposes, the Ranger I used to own simply didn't 
do the job.

For speed, or for burst acceleration?  I can drive my F150 at 95 mph 
with a full load across the flatlands of texas, and still have room left 
on the accelator.  If I want fuel efficiency, though, (and to avoid 
tickets) I tend to stay down to no more than 5mph over the limit.

The F150 heritage was available in a natural gas/gasoline hybrid (you 
could switch between fuels) for literally TWICE the price.  600 bucks 
wouldn't pay for fixing a scratch on the paint (although they did that 
for free since it was delivered scratched)

I really thought this would be a great option, burn natural gas in my 
local area and switch over to gasoline when going long distances... it 
particularly helps to note that I can go nearly 500 miles highway on a 
25 gallon tank of gas... so hopefully I wouldn't have to switch often.

Not only could I not throw an extra 16K at the option, but it wasn't 
available, according to my dealers, anywhere in the country, and would 
have to be special ordered for a 2005 instead.

If you can point me to a conversion option thats even within a magnitude 
of your suggestion of $600, I'd be pretty interested.

My dream car is a 69 VW bug converted to alcohol, dark blue, with a 
switchable water based radiator for being stuck in traffic on hot summer 
days.  Dark blue because 99% of the cars in Brazil when I was a kid 
there were that color, the factory default.  Nostalgic, I know.
