I think the "problem" is that game companies don't really want to stop it if
there's any expense to them or any detrimental effect to the game.  I agree
with them.

Banning the account will result in the same customer service cost (defending
the punishment, handling appeals, handling complaints from the bannee's
friends).  There is zero benefit to a more complicated and lesser penalty.

So, you have 80kpp, buy 100kpp on IGE, repay a loan of 120kpp to a
guildmate, buy a 60kpp item, sell it for 80kpp, and then buy 2 40kpp items,
which you give to a compatriot to hold for a week in case you get caught.
The game company discovers the sale.  What do they do now?

Easy transfer of rare and desirable items make e-baying of them inevitable.
It also makes laundering quite easy.  Fortunately, it doesn't hurt the game
very much.  Unfortunately, it makes players upset.  The best answer for a game
company is to pretend to be strongly against it, make it against the rules,
ban a few accounts, all the while not spending much effort on it.
