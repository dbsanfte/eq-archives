Thought I'd throw in a counter point to the advantage of the faster weapon
with the same ratio.
While all the good points so far hold true for most situations ( more
swings, more chances at skill-ups, more primary-hand damage bonus, better
aggro, etc...) the time where faster weapons will hurt you is when fighting
Riposting MOBs. Specifically when said MOBs also Enrage, which switches on
their Auto-Riposte.  I have literally killed myself on a Hobgoblin in the
Plane of Nightmare because he returned each of my swings  for many times
more damage!
But the easy tactic against this is to watch for the Enrage message...and
stop attacking :-)

Ripostes only apply to melee attacks in the front arc of the MOB, so if you
are not the focus of the MOBs attention (MT, or Main Tank), then many times
you will be attacking the MOBs rear, to negate any of its defensive
abilities.
