Presuming that you have Windows 98 or ME, if you just want to link two
computers, all you need to buy is 2 extra network adapters (both Fast
Ethernet), one for yur PC and one for your sons, and a Crosslinked CAT 5
network cable- you do not have to buy a router this way.
Install both extra cards then attach the cable. Install Microsoft's
"Internet Connection sharing" if not already installed by going to Start
Button-->Settings-->Control Panel-->Add/Remove Programs--->Windows Setup
Tab-->Internet Tools   and follow the wizard. reading the Readme file will
give you all the additional information you will need about IP numbers, etc.

Good luck- if everything goes nicely with no address conflicts, etc. it'll
take you maybe 30 minutes:)
