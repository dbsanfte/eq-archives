More precise: http://www.magecompendium.com/Pets/Pets.htm

But the basic differences are these:

Fire:
 -Least hp
 -Highest Att
 -Has serious damshield of it's own
 -Cast fire-based nukes
 Good if you have a well-balanced group and just want more dam-output

Air:
 -second-to-least hp
 -Decent Att
 -Goes invis when idle for a short time
 -Casts stuns
 Works wonders against casters because of the stuns

Water:
 -2nd highest hp
 -Decent Att
 -Immune to Poison
 -Casts water-based nukes
 Good all-rounder with good hp, good dam-output and nice nukes. One of the
best for soloing

Earth
 -Highest hp
 -low Att
 -casts root
 Good in dungeons because of the root. The extreme hp on earth makes it a
good one for soloing as well


I prefered water for soloing and fire when grouped. Only did earth when
there was no snarer in a group.
Air is nice when you get caster-mobs often, but a paladin in the group is
more effective in that regard :)
