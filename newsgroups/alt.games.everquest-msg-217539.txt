}You check with people here and you'll find joined interests with most of
}them if you like any of (in no particular order):
}The Princess Bride

"Have fun stormin' the castle!"

}Monty Python

"Blue... no, Green!  Aaaargh!"

}Star Wars

"I used to bullseye womprats in my T16 back home."

}Terry Pratchett

"A key to the understanding of all religion is that a god's idea of 
amusement is Snakes and Ladders with greased rungs."

}Mel Brooks

"Advance to Ludicrous Speed!"

}I'd be willing to bet that 95+ % of the people here can quote from one or
}more of the above.  And a large percentage (such as myself) can quote from
}all of the above.
}You can probably also get some good percentages on:
}Rocky Horror Picture Show

"Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have 
a telephone we can use!"
"Castles don't have phones, Asshole!"

}Tom Lehrer

"I hold your hand in mine, dear... I press it to my lips..."

}George Carlin

"So what is it you do for a living?"
"Well, I'm a handrail."
"Think you can support my daughter?"
"Well, I'll support anyone who'll hold the handrail."

Yup.  Guilty on all charges. :)
