Has anyone else been experiancing problems with Windows XP & Soundblaster
Live series of cards?

When I play EverQuest, I still have sound problems, perhaps the Soundblaster
Live
 isnt very compatible with eitherWindows XP or the Athlon Motherboard i.e
Abit KR7A-Raid,
I used to run theSoundblaster Live fine in a Asus Pentium 2 400mhz set up.
Anyone got any ideas?  Is there a soundcard out there thats just as good as
a Soundblaster
Live?  Money value doesnt matter......


I have the latest Liveware 3.0 installed & the latest downloads from the
creative website.

In certain games, music is very stuttery & not sounding like it should but
sound effects are working fine, I have moved the Card from PCI slots 4 to 3,
this has made my Cable modem run even faster as the USB Modem & Soundcard
were sharing IRQ 5, now I've moved it to PCI slot 3 its using IRQ 10, which
is not sharing anything.
