It is relaibly rumored that the highest of int, wis , or dx is used to
figure both chance for success and chance to gain a skill increase . Get one
of the 3 as close as possible to 252 before you start your attempts . The
increases skill give are enormous as well . 250 represents a 25% increase
chance of succes over 200. It is fairly easy to get the dx if you happen
upon a high level shaman and a high level chanter to help.

It is unreliably rumored that getting two of those stats up near 252 helps .
This does not follow from my perceived results .
