Brad and Jeff,

I would again like to supplement (Itzlegend)'s statements, and I
apologize if having comments from the two of us is confusing. Some of
what I'm going to say here you will find in (Itzlegend)'s letter,
since we collaborated on parts of it, but I feel that it is important
to include them here, so that you can view them in the context in
which they are intended. My focus at this point is conflict
resolution, and not to prove who knows more about game mechanics.

In short, you have alleged three different exploits, one of which
leads to our certain defeat, and the other two are consistently
applauded or ignored by SOE employees. It is this long history of GM
response (or non-response) to these tactics that led us to believe
that we were not on the wrong side of the rules. You state that these
items are indeed exploits, and naturally, you are the final arbiters
(no pun intended) of what is and what is not an exploit. However, we
do believe it is infinitely reasonable that we drew the conclusion
that we were not breaking the rules, based on your company's long
record of non-punishment of these tactics.

It is our understanding that this is precisely what a warning is
designed to do: Inform the violator(s) that they are indeed breaking
the rules. As far as we understand it, suspensions are reserved for
those who have already received warnings, yet have ignored those
warnings and continued their illegal activities. Finally, our
understanding is that banning is reserved for those who habitually
break the rules despite warnings and suspensions for *the same
infractions*.

Now that the intensity of the moment has died down, we think that you
can clearly see, as we can, that the punishment you have dispensed far
exceeds the crimes you have determined we committed. We believe that
if you choose to overturn the precedent set by your various GMs on
these tactics, it is certainly your right to do so. If you do choose
to do this, then one would think that we would certainly deserve only
warnings for the events that took place in this incident since it
would then become a case of you changing the rules, and then punishing
us afterward.

In our opinion, and apparently in the opinion of the public at large,
the suspensions we have received, and in two cases, the bannings we
have received are not justified. After your own statement, &#8220;I
can only conclude that what you did in your minds wasn't exploiting a
safe zone&#8221; how can you honestly justify the punishment that has
been delivered? As the Guide Handbook states: &#8220;8.5.4.2 The key
to determining wheter a person is exploiting is not in the activity,
but in the intent&#8221;.

Furthermore, it is our opinion that the disbanding of the guild based
on this single incident is also unfair, as we were told by Michelle
Butler "Should the guild have a history of problems on their record
the guild will be disbanded." I'm sure you will agree that this single
incident hardly qualifies as "a history of problems" and that the
disbanding of the guild is also a bit extreme, given the facts.

On a final note, there are many statements you made in your public
release that you have since retracted to us in private. We would
appreciate it if you would either amend your letter to reflect your
current position, or issue a second letter correcting the errors.

I would personally advocate issuing a joint statement detailing the
findings of the investigation, the definition of our actions as
"punishable exploits", and the resulting amended punishment. We think
this would be a great way to highlight how the zone and its
inhabitants are new in design, and the permissibility of older
strategies and tactics need to be rethought. Conquest was wrong in
assuming that older "borderline exploits" were allowed there, and SOE
has been wrong in not equitably enforcing these rules within Sleeper's
Tomb across all servers. We think that will resolve this issue with a
great sense of decorum for both sides.

I would like to request that you consider this issue with haste, as
our only guild Shadow Knight, Ralanan, is scheduled to participate in
the BOTB tournament this weekend.

-Gtath

You're correct -- we were wrong there. Summon recycle times vary by
zone,
and Sleepers has a 10 second recycle to make it more difficult.

I agree, but I think there's an even bigger difference between 10
seconds
and constant melee.

This is an area it's pretty hard to quantify -- that is, just HOW much
of an
advantage did it give you. Our opinion remains, though: if the dragon
went
under the bridge and attacked the clerics there directly, you'd have a
significantly harder time keeping the tank alive.

I'll agree with that -- an exploit is using a bug to your advantage.
It's
still my opinion that in several cases here, that is exactly what you
did.

We assume(d) you had items that healed, etc., allowing you to build up
hate
there. In fact, one of the GMs has been instructed to look at your
character in the backups and examine your inventory. In the meantime,
I'll
take your word for it, however, that you did not.

That is part of the justification, yes. As for players using similar
tactics on Vox and Nagafen, we are aware they do, and my understanding
is
that players are warned for it, and repeat offenders are suspended.
There
is an important difference here, however: Vox and Nagafen have been
done
many times. What you were trying to do has not. Therefore, if you were
to
accomplish something this rare and difficult by exploit, you are
cheapening
the game for others far more than someone exploiting Vox or Nagafen.
This
fact influenced the severity of the punishment.

This is true. Summon was put in on higher-end mobs to make them more
difficult to evade AND exploit. That said, getting one stuck so that
he can
only summon is not OK just because he can still summon. This is a very
important point (and probably an area we're not seeing eye to eye on).

Again, to my knowledge, CS does enforce exploiting Vox or Nagafen as
such.
Again, however, I don't think the punishment is a severe because of
the
nature of the encounter.

Understood, but if it's using a safe zone, it is still an exploit,
regardless of which zone or which NPC is involved.

Agreed -- we were wrong there, overlooking the fact that you'd fall to
the
bottom of the world there. This was an assumption because the logs
aren't
THAT detailed.

Again, I believe it IS challenged by us. I just called Michelle Butler
and
talked to her about this. When they do catch people exploiting Nagafen
or
Vox in this manner they are warned and often removed from the zone and
told
they can't do the dragon this spawn. If they are on record as repeat
offenders in this area, they are suspended. She also said I was
welcome to
review warning and suspension logs for this on Monday, so I'll
probably take
a look at them then.

Ok -- we got this from the guild chat logs, and it was hard to tell
exactly
why you aborted. I'll take your word for it.

Again, we feel it WAS helpful, both before the main assault and
during.

Advantage before assault: Assuming you were not building up hate as
well
using items, it is still a huge advantage setting up logistically
before the
encounter. You were able to get everyone in place while the NPC was
stuck.
Perhaps you could explain from your perspective what you were doing
for
those 15 minutes and WHY you held the mob stuck there for 15 minutes
before
attacking?

Advantage during assault: The clerics (when they would reach the top
of the
hate list -- we realize you were doing your best to avoid this) were
hit for
far less damage because the dragon was not going under the bridge to
melee
them, but rather was just summoning them every 10 seconds or so.

Detecting spell stacking is far harder for GMs to do than detecting
safe
zone violations. In fact, had Kendrick and Jeff Butler not been
watching,
this aspect of the event might have been missed for a while (they were
more
familiar with the encounter, the details of the dragon's breath
weapon,
etc.) So, unfortunately, punishment for spell stack exploitation
probably
does occur less often. This doesn't make it any less of an exploit
though,
and quite simply, it allowed the tank and others to deal MORE damage
during
the encounter than they were supposed to and receive less. This is why
you
were able to kill the other warders and get as far as you did with
this one
with FAR fewer players than the encounter was designed for.

This really is the key here, guys. These encounters were designed for
60 or
so players, and you were doing pretty well with 28 or so. Couple that
with
the fact that these encounters hadn't really been done before and are
still
very exotic (you guys knew this, which is why you were all so very
excited
to do this -- bragging rights, and such). This is why the punishment
was as
extreme as it was: multiple exploits used to prevail over some of the
most
exotic encounters in the game that are attempted VERY rarely. And it
remains our opinion that exploiting these types of encounters severely
cheapens the game experience for others. So we came down pretty hard
on you
all.

** argument that the punishment should be less than it was deleted --
I
already addressed why I disagree **

Lastly, I'd like to point out a final factor that was taken into
consideration when the severity of the punishment was devised. Let's
look
at the following guild chat snippet (which certainly is NOT taken out
of
context):

[Mon Jun 04 20:28:04 2001] Itzlegend told the guild, 'not if they nerf
3rd
tomor ;( heh'
[Mon Jun 04 20:28:21 2001] Sycotic told the guild, 'they plan on

3rd?'
[Mon Jun 04 20:28:25 2001] Ketsui told the guild, 'yes tommorow syc'

[Mon Jun 04 20:28:35 2001] Ketsui told the guild, 'so lets make sure
we do
it tonight'
[Mon Jun 04 20:28:36 2001] Sycotic told the guild, 'so no snare
sploit?'
[Mon Jun 04 20:28:39 2001] Ketsui told the guild, 'nope'
[Mon Jun 04 20:28:40 2001] Gtath told the guild, 'what are they doing
to 3?'
[Mon Jun 04 20:28:44 2001] Gtath told the guild, 'Killing snare
sploit?'
[Mon Jun 04 20:28:48 2001] Ketsui told the guild, 'changing it so we
cant
snare sploit'
[Mon Jun 04 20:28:49 2001] Kaetlyn told the guild, 'LoS! Rez! Pathing!
Agro!
With our powers combine, we summon forth ITZLEGEND!'
[Mon Jun 04 20:28:56 2001] Caylen told the guild, 'hehe'
[Mon Jun 04 20:28:56 2001] Caduseus told the guild, 'ROFL'
[Mon Jun 04 20:28:57 2001] Itzlegend told the guild, 'we dont know
that'
[Mon Jun 04 20:29:00 2001] Itzlegend told the guild, 'its a rumor'
[Mon Jun 04 20:29:09 2001] Sycotic told the guild, 'i hope not sigh'
[Mon Jun 04 20:29:12 2001] Itzlegend told the guild, 'dont go afk
long'
[Mon Jun 04 20:29:15 2001] Itzlegend told the guild, 'this isnt going
to
take long'
[Mon Jun 04 20:29:21 2001] Itzlegend told the guild, 'we are just
buffing
healers and me'
[Mon Jun 04 20:29:22 2001] Dashel told the guild, 'how would 3rd
warder die
then? zerg?'
[Mon Jun 04 20:29:29 2001] Itzlegend told the guild, 'it wouldnt'
[Mon Jun 04 20:29:39 2001] Itzlegend told the guild, 'not without 60
people
anyways'

This tells me:

1. You knew the snare bug is an 'exploit.'
2. You'd heard a rumor that we were going to fix it soon and therefore
wanted to exploit it ASAP
3. That Itzlengend's 'clever tactics' include using pathing
problems/bugs
4. That you knew the encounter would take 60 people were it approached
conventionally

So, in summary, we feel:

1. You knew the spell stacking bug was an exploit and planned ahead of
time
to use it
2. You knew attacking the mob conventionally ('zerg'ing it -- I like
the
Starcraft reference  would require 60 or so people, which, btw, is
pretty
close to exactly how many players the encounter WAS DESIGNED FOR.
3. You imply that Itzlegend in general uses pathing bugs as tactics
4. You used a safe zone prior to combat to position the target mob
where you
wanted him, and to allow you time to logistically set up your forces
5. You used a safe zone during combat such that your primary healers
could
only be summoned every 10 seconds or so as opposed to being melee'd.
This
gave you time to preemptively CoH and res people out of danger. Had
the
target mob been able to reach your forces under the bridge, the combat
would
have worked very differently.
6. You used a spell stacking bug to avoid the major effects of the
target
mob's area effect breath weapon, allowing you, amongst other things,
to deal
MUCH more damage over time to the target mob than was intended.

And, in making our determination as to the extent of the punishment,
we used
the following details:

1. The encounter in question is supposed to be one of the most
difficult
encounters in the game, designed for 60 or so level 55+ players, and
could
even semi-accurately be described as part of the game's 'end game'
(were
such a description valid for a game we keep adding content to  
2. You knew this was a very exotic encounter, and you planned ahead of
time
to use exploit(s) you knew were exploits.

And, while we do believe that most in your guild probably did not
expect
punishment as severe, you DID expect us to do something were you
discovered
(I reference the guild chat where players mentioned that were you
discovered
doing this by a GM, he'd probably kick you out and shut down/reset the
zone).

You must understand that this knowledge, the type of encounter, and
the
actual exploits used are all factors. Keep in mind that many game
designers
spent a lot of time setting up these final Sleeper encounters, and we
feel a
guild using exploits to take on these encounters with far fewer people
than
designed cheapens the encounter, and thus the experience for future
guilds
who might experience the encounter with a force capable of defeating
the
encounter without exploit.

Because of all this, I am very much inclined to let the disciplinary
actions
stand. I am also inclined to publicly post much of what I've disclosed
to
you because it bothers me greatly that this has turned into a
situation
where many of our players believe we acting wrongly, and out of
malice,
ignorance, or both. 

If we are guilty of anything, it is not investigating the details to
the
extent that I have, and for posting some of the assumptions we made
earlier
on that were inaccurate. I also believe that our policy of not
publicly
commenting on warnings, suspensions, and bannings severely inhibits
the flow
of information such that many of our players don't know how seriously
we
view exploitation and how often and to what extent players ARE
disciplined
for exploiting. I intend on addressing these issues in the very near
future
by working with our CS department to revise some of our policies.

As always, please feel free to address these issues and make comment.

-Brad
