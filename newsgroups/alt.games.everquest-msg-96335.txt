Not quite accurate.  When I've parsed my hits I see a fairly even spread
between minimum and maximum accounting for about 80% of the hits with a
pronounced peak at ((base_dmg * 2) + dmg_bonus) for the other 20%.  This
is vs. blue con mobs, the distribution of the non-magic number hits is
skewed if fighting greens/reds.  Still not a very large effect tho,
the 30-odd STR bonus from Storm Strength (the buff on the woven frost
giant beard) had less effect on my average damage per hit than the
switch in damage tables when I leveled from 50 to 51.

Strictly for entertainment purposes tho, getting a big STR boost when
fighting very low blue to green mobs with two-handed weapons can produce
an impressive string of big damage numbers.
