The source of the confusion is probably that when you look at, say, Bronze 
Boots by right-clicking on them to get the stats, it very clearly says 
'Size: LARGE' right on it.  Unfortunately, this is referring to the size 
of inventory slot it takes up, and does not mean that they are Large 
Bronze Boots (although those are also Size: Large, as are the Small 
ones.)
