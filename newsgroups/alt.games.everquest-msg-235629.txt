You should have kept reading.  Farther down, he says they can leave if they
want.  Given the size he's aiming for, try thinking of the farm as a
village, and then it is a lot less weird--he just seems to want to have
a village that is productive enough that people who grow up there can stay
there if they want.

Of course, other parts of it are pretty weird...
