I don't dislike ToV.  I dislike that there's only *one* ToV.  If there were
five copies of ToV running on each server, I'd be happy.  As it is, I've
never managed to catch a *single* named mob up in HoT.  NToV is done within
hours of servers coming up, and up until the staggered-spawns change I could
guarantee all named past the first four drakes would be dead by the time I
got home from work.  Now there's a guild sitting there waiting for them to
pop before I get home from work, so the change did little.

I can feel my guild losing interest in ToV entirely now, before we ever hit
a named, because they've got most of the base quest armor and there's
nothing left for them there.  That's poor design.
