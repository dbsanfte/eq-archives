What a hoot ... have to I have generally (apart from a few random
comments) held my bit about the talk fest.

But let's see:

People are leaving the game ... who do they invite? ... not players who
have recently left the game ... not those who are struggling with real
problems in the game ... but a bunch of raid type high end guild
leaders and those with a completely vested interest in the game (owners
of web sites etc).

Do they make any attempt to address the concerns of most players in the
game?  No, they pander to the top 10% in the game. Six of the nine
"immediate" things to fix have nothing whatsoever to do with 90% of the
player base.  Sigh.

This game is now officially dead, I think.
