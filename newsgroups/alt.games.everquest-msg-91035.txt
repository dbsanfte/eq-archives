Well since early last week I can't from any of my 3 PCs do anything in Kael.
I zone in and boom I am kicked to server select screen. I have no common
files from the 3 PCs and they are all using my cable connection from Charter
Communications here in MA.

Cable provider checked and rechecked everything. I wiped and reinstalled EQ
on 1 PC to rule out some odd software issue.

I can have a friend log in my accounts on their PC and move my characters
out of Kael but if I try I always get kicked to the server select screen.

Does anyone have any ideas what might be doing this? Sony has been no help
and the cable company says everything is fine.

Would be nice to be able to use Kael again...

email replies to rfeehan@charter.net would be most appreciated.
