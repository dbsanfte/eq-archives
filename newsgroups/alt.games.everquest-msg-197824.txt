anyone else follow WTF comics?  Ever since the first day I saw that 
newbie druid I knew exactly what she was going through, I was that young 
druid at one time.  The current one has her casting her very first spell 
and of course, she ends up rooting herself.  It was so hilarious I 
almost fell out of my chair laughing.
