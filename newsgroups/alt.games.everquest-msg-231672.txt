RogerWilco - does this, works great, lower voice quality, don't forget 
to disable the 'static bursts' that it includes as a 'feature'. :)

Microsoft Game Voice - does this, works well, but is more demanding on 
the PCs involved, and thus degrades faster. I think at least one person 
needs a 'full version' that comes with the voice recognition stuff, 
everyone else can get away with the free version downloadable from MS.

MSN Messenger - works very well, but I've only used it with one other 
person at a time. I don't know if this can scale beyond two people.

I'm sure other chat clients will work too, but these are the ones I've used.
