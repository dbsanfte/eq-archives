No. the terms don't ring a bell because i don't do programs professionally. I do however write and debug programs for my company.
(small as it may be.) My ass would be fired if i left a fully bug ridden program onto my network and didn't test my fixs before i put it
on the server. For how much they make off of us there is NO excuse why we should have to put up with their being "lazy." (my word.)
