    His will be one of the good stories, too. Verant has set the stage for
people to be MUCH nastier than at the old Ragefire. All the new spawn did
was clear up the PnP issues around the mob so the GMs have an easier job.

    They're so CUTE when they're young and innocent! Jazz, at that level
guilds will do just about anything to get what they want if it's important
enough. Back when bagging Trakanon was a three-way fight on my server, one
guild would camp in the zone before a patch, the second guild would camp in
the buff area before the patch, and the third guild would zone in after the
patch, call a GM, and demand a roll on the "contested spawn". And they did
it again with Zlandicar and Myga when Velious came out and when DB was
introduced, respectively. And I haven't even begun to mention the accidental
train-outs that resulted from two guilds' worth of players in buff areas
designed for one at most. If they value it, they will fight for it using
every means necessary. And as for reputation? "You people always bring up
incident X, it happened a long time ago, stop living in the past" - it's
easy to erase misdeeds if you embarass your opponents into not mentioning
them long enough that people forget they ever happened.

    And now, to make this situation REALLY hit home: Tiru isn't in your
guild, even though Tiru adventures with you constantly, correct? Imagine the
conflict if the small-guild cleric was Tiru, and a cleric in your guild was
just the box away from an epic. This mob stinks, no two ways about it.

    No, no way, not a chance, never. A mob out in an open zone, with no
placeholder? I'm not even sure Morel Thule is staying with their list, and
they were by far the most civilized about this before.

    Here's a final story about how self-oriented (to the point of stupidity)
guilds can be. On my server, there's two NToV-capable guilds. They have an
uneasy truce, and share a Velious rotation - when one kills NToV, the other
gets the Velious kings. The guild that is newer to NToV, Lotus Cult, still
requires two days to clear. This Friday, I went with them to kill what
they'd left over from the previous night, Vyemm and Vulak - the cream of the
loot mobs and bosses of NToV. As a recruit they tagged me for communications
purposes (yeah, me - yuck it up). So I was able to see /gu.

    We killed Vulak after over 20 minutes of fighting (with me on the CH
team, casting CHeal on the same warrior every 30 seconds on the dot - I
nearly fell over asleep), and were deciding the loot/ressing the very few
dead, when a dead ranger bound in Kael told the guild Tormax was up. Now, I
told you how the rotation goes. *I* know it, so you know the guild knows it.
/gu ERUPTS with "Let's go get him!" and "They won't miss what they never
see!" until the guild leader spammed "WE WILL NOT BE KILLING TORMAX" in
shout and /gu. And Lotus Cult, in my opinion, is perhaps the most mature of
all the upper-end guilds on our server.

    Lodizal is FFA. Ragefire is a zoo.
