The player economy is designed into the game.  While your use of the
term "exploit" may be dictionary correct, in context it has a highly
pejorative "usual" meaning that you are obviously well aware of (i.e.
"exploit" in EQ = cheat).  And that makes your assertion here both
stupid and false, because, wait for it now..., the player economy is
designed into the game.  You are not required to like it, but by the
same token the rest of us are not required to subscribe to your
negative opinion of it.  And while many of us will freely admit that
it is not wonderfully implemented, it is and always has been part of
the game.  EQ would not be EQ without it.
