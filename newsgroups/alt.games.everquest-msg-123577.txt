This is because many Kunark zones have what was originally nicknamed an
"anti-kiting code". It was code introduced with Kunark that made it so a mob
would run away and never come back to you if the distance between you and the
mob was to great. It was designed to counter the techniques of kiters to open
major distance between them and their target then blast away as the mob came
in.

The problem arose though that some high range bow and arrows actually had a
range greater then the pulling distance needed for the mob to stay with you. So
bow users started using an exploit that allowed them to fire their bows at a
target at extreme range without any possible chance that the mob will come at
them to melee. The mob would still take the damage from the bow shots. They
then made it so that a roaming mob would run to its spawn point if agroed by
someone but that someone was outside of the pull range. This made it so people
could not exploit the bow vs pull range introduced to reduce kiting advantages.
