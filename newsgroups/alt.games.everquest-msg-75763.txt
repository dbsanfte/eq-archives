I recommend a Centi sword for your secondary. Saw a Wood Elf Ranger using a
Centi and a Wurmy a few days ago, and they said it worked out great.

2HS? Bah. If you're a Pally or SK, maybe. Otherwise, I'd say just train in 2HS
if you want to use a back-up or set-up weapon that's 2HS. (Ogre Warrior using a
Weighted Axe for an opening attack, then switching to dual wield for the rest
of the fight, for instance....the only circumstance where ANYONE should ever
use that weapon)

And what is Copeland's Weapons Analyzer?
