As distracting as it is to read posts and emails with typos in it, I find that
it takes just a bit of extra focus to look past the errors to the real content.

I find this when I'm talking to people too... mispronunciation of a word
used to throw me for a loop, and I'd lose the whole goal of why I was
listening to them in the first place - to receive what they are trying
to say.  Lately, I've been working on keeping the focus on the intent
of the communication, not how it's performed.

Sometimes disambiguating the meaning will require a bit of brain work, and
if it's truly ambiguous, a simple question will do to solve the confusion.
And this question will often convey a "correction request" at the same time.
If the ambiguity is easy to solve, that there's a much higher likelyhood
of one meaning than others, no question is needed and the communication
can flow unabated.  Unless of course they are asking for a critique, in
which case the goal of the communication becomes different and perhaps
two-fold - information transferral and grammar/spelling correction.
