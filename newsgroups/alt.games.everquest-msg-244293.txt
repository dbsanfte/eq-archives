My point was that they took a lot of the functionality of EQTraders..
that being recipe look up, resource finding, trivial listing, and
placed it in game so that you need to page out less and less to
EQTraders. They can do it with a smile and a grin.. and it was
needed.. but it removes quite a bit of the reason for people to access
EQTraders.
