Good points, although I don't entirely agree. Yes now I remember a few
mobs that were toned down (almost all related to epics if im not
mistaken) and the one in Mistmoore that was controlled by one of the
developers that left the company. But they move so slowly to make mobs
easier and so quickly to make mobs more difficult. There really is a
balance problem and too many empty zones out there because of it.
