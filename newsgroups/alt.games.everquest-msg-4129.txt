Raping you huh?  So I inspect you and see that the Whip you have is a
Whip of Strangulation and I ask you about it.  That is somehow RAPE?
Or you are wearing a chestpiece I have never seen before so I quick
inspect to see what it is so I can look it up and find out about how
to get one.  That is somehow rape?   Come on.

When I do an emote about how I knock you to the ground and strip you
and have my way with your naked body yell rape, but for inspections?
Not hardly.
