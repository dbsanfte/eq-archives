However Breeze and Clarity have a fairly short duration, while
KEI can last as long as 4 hours if the caster has the right gear
and AAs.  If Breeze and Clarity lasted 2 hours you wouldn't have
seen nearly as many people begging for KEI back in the days when
KEI could be cast on everyone; its the idea of massive mana
regeneration that lasts long enough to go find a nice exp and
loot camp and work it for the evening that really floats
everyone's boat.  Likewise, if KEI lasted 20 minutes, the KEI
salesmen would have to pack up their bags and go home; thats not
long enough to really be of interest, unless of course the caster
is in your group and can refresh it as needed.
