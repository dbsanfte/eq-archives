serverwide.enchanters:enchanters (for the eq.crgaming.com enchanters, may be
enchanter:enchanter, if you join and there's 6 people, try the other)
serverwide.eqchanters:eqchanters (for the l33+ 0|\|35 from eqchanters, at
least the one time I was there. I see less leet speak in oasis, loio, and pc
combined than I saw there.)
serverwide.eqtraders:eqtraders - tradeskill channel. Don't ask for recipies,
half the channel has 'go to http://www.eqtraders.com' hotkeyed :)

Note all of the above have passwords about 50/50. The good news is if you
try to join a channel with no password it ignores the password you specify.
