A hit or two isn't a lot.  Letting a mob beat you down
to near death isn't even a lot.  Spending an hour letting
every mob beat you nearly to death, -thats- a lot.

Helps if you can find mobs that hit fast, for relatively little
damage per swing.  Unfortunately, I've been unable to
find a source listing mobs of that nature, surprising since
beyond the porcupining druid demand, such mobs would
be ideal fodder for any group with a druid or mage
to DS the tank.

If you like train kiting, by the way, get a monk partner.
With yourself and the monk SOW'd, and the mob snared,
you can pretty much -have- the mob chase you while
being beat to death.  Same trick works with a rogue;
FD or Evade to wipe the tankling down the hate list,
to keep that mob on the tantalizingly unreachable druid.
