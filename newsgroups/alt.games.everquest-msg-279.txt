Then you are judging a "kewldood" based on their behavior, not based on
their name as you state above.  I still want to know what you do when a guy
with a "kewldood" name comes to your aid unexpectedly.  It does happen. 
Just because someone uses a name that isn't in a rp spirit and severly
breaks immersion in the world *doesn't* mean that they are jerks.

: Yes, there is a difference between kewldoods and people with creative yet

: group wouldn't be associatd with the kewldoods anyway, so they wouldn't care
: if a  kewldood was blacklisted

Depending on you are defining "kewldood" (behavior or name) here I could
argue that no reasonable player would associate with them period... rp group
or not.  If someone conducts themselves poorly that is reason enough to not
want to have anything to do with them.  A name, on the otherhand, is a silly
one.

: This is Verant's fault,

I really don't think this to be the case.  I for one don't consider it a
*fault*.  I like /gu just the way it is.

Besides, this is just one example of something that doesn't "make sense" in
the game, there are others that you also leave out.  How about direct tells? 
Off?  Needs ooc?  What about the bank?  No WAY that makes "sense."  Are you
going to prohibit yourself and others from using it?  What about the way
inventory is handled?  Also, doesn't make sense...only in a ooc sense does
it make sense. 

: If  you cant handle a  train in a  certain  zone,  you really  shouldn't be
: there anyhow. Its simple. Its just like the tourist who comes to new  York

Um, no, it isn't simple.  By the time you are of high enough level to handle
a train in a specific zone, then there is no point in being there.

...how much did you say you played this game before you quit?
 

: No, actually I  haven't  tried the other  guilds. I havn't  enough faith  in
: what's  out there to attempt such. I'll start from scratch.

Basicly this amounts to "I haven't seen it, but I know I don't like it."

(too tired to write much more)...
