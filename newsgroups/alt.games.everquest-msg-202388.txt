I'd get a geforce FX 5900. Its the next one and eliminates many of the
problems of the 5800 (nicknamed "the hoover") 

The full FX 5900 comes in a 256 meg version AND a 128 meg version. The
second choice is about 100 bucks less, but still a great card (its
otherwise the same.)

I don't think its quite out yet, but is the clear winner.
