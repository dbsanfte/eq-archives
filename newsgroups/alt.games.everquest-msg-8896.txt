I don't recall.  I know that one time it was clarity, but I think that just
recently a druid friend of mine watch someone die to a critter despite her
casting heal him a couple times.

I honestly don't know.  Main thing I remember is if you're in a duel
someone'd better die or zone before you plan on doing something else.
