One evening in guild chat, another guildy and myself have been goofing off a
bit.  more along the lines of emotes like

<Xxxxxx!! TACKLE!!>
<myself grabs hold of Xxxxx and spins her round>

You get the idea.  Well guild business came up and i didnt catch some of her
emotes.. here is a summary of what happened. keep in mind that the guild
chat is very livly at the moment.

<Xxxxxx sticks her tounge out at me for ignoring her>
<I kiss Xxxxx and bolt for the door>

the entire guild goes dead silent

<Xxxx sits, unsure what to make of that>
