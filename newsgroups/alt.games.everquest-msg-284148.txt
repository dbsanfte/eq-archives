I play mainly a warrior. As such, healing capability is crucial to my 
effectiveness in a group.

When my warrior was in the 50s, LDoN was the best way to group and get 
xp. But our server (Venril Sathir) was a wasteland. Groups were few and 
far between. I used to do LDoNs - and win them! with a necro as healer, 
and a paladin offtanking / backup healing. In groups with no crowd 
control unless the mobs were undead ... it was a lot of fun. Mind you, I 
did sometimes need a cleric afterwards, as I waded through a pile of 
five of my bodies generated in a mad rush to get the win ....

Even now, in the better world of merged servers, it's sometimes 
necessary - and often fun - to just join up with the first 5 people you 
can find LFG that you trust, and do - whatever. A shaman can main heal 
very effectively in zones up to at least MPG / Thundercrest Isles. A 
druid can keep me up in RSS or the Devastation. Admittedly, its been a 
while since I've used a necro as main healer, or 3 bstys ...

Anyway. Clerics are handy, but not essential in most circumstances. The 
ones who can pitch their CHeals precisely to land just as my hp are 
dropping to 25-30% (so I get a chance at a couple of crippling blows!) 
are amazingly mana efficient. But the game is about having fun with 
everyone around you, not everyone fulfilling their key role (and their 
key role only) with military precision. Hey, I've joined groups as 
slower, snarer and offtank -- weapon proc utility!

As for twitching - it's used almost exclusively on raids in my 
experience, purely as a means of minimising recovery time - using the 
mana regen of 3 necros and 1 cleric to bring the freshly-rezzed cleric 
back up to FM swiftly. Not an efficient use of necro mana in a group 
situation usually.
