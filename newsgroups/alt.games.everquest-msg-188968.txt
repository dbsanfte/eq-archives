Why on Norrath would one pull to the GY?

It's way out of the way from the cells and far from ZO. The corridors
leading to ZO is a much better camp spot.
Or in the case of both corridors being camped, just behind the entry door to
the first cell area is a good spot, since it is just as close to cells and
not really far from ZO.
