Its all personal tastes when it comes to whats exciting and whats
boring.  I mean you seem to play a necro and are very enthusiastic about
it if you are the same "anonymous" that made the necro posts.  Necro is
one of the few classes I've tried numerous times yet always get bored
with very quickly as they are too easy to solo and even easier if they
partner with someone.  Slow-Fear-Pet-Dot and the pattern rarely changes
from lvl to lvl, it just doesn't work for me.  Are you wrong and I'm
right, or the other way around?  Nope, if we have fun we are both right,
thats the nice thing about a game that provides options.

As for the thing you have about druids medding so much <EG>  you know
when you have a Half Elf's wisdom and don't load up on stat boost
equipment it doesn't take very long at all to med to full, heh.  In fact
since I don't have enough mana for what ever tactic you were describing
I tend to rot rather than kite except for casters (who I tend to either
blow up fast, run away from, or get killed by <G>), so I'm medding for
most of the battle and actually often come out with a pretty full tank. 
Its the times when root wont stick and the dots are resisted that
provide the excitement.
