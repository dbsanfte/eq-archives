Won't work.  The reason that that 1000pp item drops in price to 50pp
is that it (or one or more comparable items) is common as dirt.  If
you raise the vendor price on common items you just make the rich
richer (as 42 pointed out).  OTOH, if you make the items rare then
it doesn't matter (much) what you do with the vendor price.

The problem with EQ's economy isn't that, for instance, a Sharpened
Flotsam is a pretty decent and effective piercer for lowbies.  It's
that the weapon is so easily obtained by players in their 30s and
40s that it ends up defining the market for items at or near its
recommended level.  If a weapon isn't noticeably better nobody who
takes the time to do even a small amount of in-game research will
pay much for it.  This phenomenon isn't recent, nor even post-bazaar.
When the Langseax quest first became well known back in the early
days, it quickly changed the market for low-/mid-level one-handers
because (1) Warriors could buy a decent (at the time) 1hs for 10 to
20pp which changed their expectations of price/performance, and (2)
Warrior demand for the more rare 1-hand weapons with comparable
effectiveness dropped dramatically, so the sellers found they had to
wait a lot longer to find a buyer even at lower prices than they
were accustomed to.

I think EQ is acutally more than halfway to a good solution.  In my
opinion we've suffered for the shortsightedness, perhaps blindness,
of the various incarnations of the dev-team over the years.  There
really isn't, afaict, a good coherent view of gear and gameplay,
nor has there been.  Even so there's a lot more good than bad to
what we've got.  It's easy to slam hunting for tradeskill components
as an advancement path for the beginner and/or casual player, but it
would be far worse to have no reasonably attainable path open to
everybody.

Your NODROP plan would totally screw pure-melees and knights who
were not in a position to develop a regular group from very early
on, it's bad enough for them in comparison to soloable classes the
way things are now, I don't understand why you are so intent on
punishing them further.  Tanks, Rogues, and Monks who play casually
have enough troubles as it is, any generic "make it tougher on them
all!" plan is going to hit them disproportionately hard.  If you
haven't got a clear and plainly sound method of addressing this in
place you might as well rename it "Solo Caster and Hardcore Raider
Heaven".
