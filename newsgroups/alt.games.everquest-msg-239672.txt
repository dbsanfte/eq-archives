    I went with the TAK BP but have bought the EF legs and will buy arms and
hands there - the extra points felt closer to worth it with the BP - the
bigger numbers mean the value of the extra points spent is better. The other
pieces I have to agree, not worth anything like 2x the wait, and I'd rather
start spending up on FT and HP augs sooner.

    In fact, have already bought the FTII chest only aug and glued it to my
BP ;)
