This does not make sense.

The reason I changed my handle/email address was to ensure that he knows
that I don't care.

Don't you know what a KF means?  Do you really think that person 'enacting'
the kill file really cares about whether the killfiled person's posts show
up?  No.  It's to say, I don't give a fuck about you, you're worthless, blah
blah blah.  My point in changing my handle was to say the same thing back to
him.  Unfortunately, I can't let that be known if he has me KFed.  I WANT
him to know that I DON'T GIVE A SHIT!
