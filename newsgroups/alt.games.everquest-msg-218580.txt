Hum, kind of a related question that's been bubbling in my mind the past 
few days.

In holding aggro, is the faster weapon better or the one with the better 
delay?

Specifically speaking, normally Satrika dual-wields a Sambata War Staff 
(8/18, in primary because that's the only place it goes) and a Green Jade 
Broadsword (11/25).  Lately, though, she's been hacking away with a 
Firerune Brand (21/40 with Ignite proc that according to Lucy will activate 
at level 30).

I'm currently assuming that the warstaff/broadsword combo would be better 
at pissing the mob off than the 2-hander, but I hate making asses out of 
ume.  ;)
