Actually, the key on the trilogy/gold boxes is for ALL parts that are 
there..For example, the trilogy key opens up the game, Kunark and 
Velious, all on the same key.  So, no, you can't do it that way...unless 
you cancel the "classic" account and start a NEW account with the boxed 
set.  (I guess that would give you TWO free months, if you timed it 
right.)

Anyway, that's the way i see it.
