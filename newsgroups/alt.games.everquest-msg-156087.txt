It's not just you.  I haven't noticed anything in Shadowhaven, but every
Luclin zone that has trees or boulders look just downright funky... the
boulders have the same tiling that the wizard spires do.  And the trees are
just downright ... colorful... :)

Also, any wolves look like the designers were on a heavy acid trip at the
