The manual has some info on them.

I have seen a web site or two, but they were kind of crude.

The main thing is that you can take a macro defined as a social and turn
it into a hot key by left-clicking down for a few seconds then drag the button
to the hot key slot.

As for the macro itself, the biggest wierd thing to learn is the /pause command.
You get the best use of it by combining it with another command, such as

/pause 1000, /doability 3

From what I understand, you can't combine any other commands in this way... only
pause.  And the wierd part is that the pause occurs *after* the /doability

So, as an example,

/pause 22, /doability 6
/pause 22, /doability 6
/pause 22, /doability 6
/pause 22, /doability 6
/doability 6

Will do ability number 6, 5 times with a 220 millisecond delay in between
each ability 6 invocation.  This is useful for sense heading, or other
repetitive skills like forage.

However, I prefer to wire my left and right movement keys to sense heading
and/or forage.

Macros are good for spell casting too... things you do often, like
mez a mob then tell your group mates that you mezzed it.  Something like:

/g Attempting to mez %t!  Don't hit it!
/g Assist the tank!
/pause 20, /cast 5       <-- (tashan then wait 2.0 seconds)
/cast 2                  <-- (mesmerize)
