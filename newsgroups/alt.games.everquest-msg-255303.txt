Like fully auged ldon gear?

Because you sounded like one.

Didnt say they should, but that is the easiest place to get gear, most of
items in the bazaar can be got solo / grouped..

Currently, yes.  It is how the game is designed.

People make the game what they want it to be.

/em points to ldon again.

So spiderling silks are the only tradeskill items? Metallic liquid for
example, is one soloable camp (golems in pov), that nets exp and tradeskill
drops.

I am never at a loss for anything to do, when I have the time to solo, YMMV.
Maybe I am just easily amused.

Karma goes a long way sometimes :) BTW I count ldon as 'kinda solo' even
though its grouped, due to how fast it is, and the lack of need to stay with
that group after the 30mins or however long it takes you to get the
adventure, the points you earn are yours, to spend how you wish.

It sounds like you want 30 minute content that drops uber loot
(exageration..), but as has been stated this will not be happening, and me,
as a solo / group and raid player, am thankful for that.

Its a simple concept really, big bad ass mob, drops big bad ass loot, and
needs a bunch of badass's to do it.  Gimp mob, drops gimp loot, and requires
a 'gimp' amount of people to do.  Everquest is PURELY numbers based, so this
makes perfect sense to me.

Isildur, King of men, with and army of men and elves, cut the one ring from
the hand of Sauron, and obtained the one ring.
Bob, Ferryman, killed 10,000 goblins solo, and gave their skin to Gandalf
the Wayfarer, and obtained the one ring.

Does that seem right (aside from the obvious crapness of a LoTR reference).
