And min-maxed all to hell. As people twitch misc-tribute on and off for 
named, ft on when they're lom, etc etc etc

I agree that the current system is badly thought out... but giving in 
and letting you turn them on & off at will is a bit ridiculous. Might as 
well let us 'suspend' and 'resume' all our buffs... so we don't waste 
any of the KEI timer when were FM.... or... SOW when we don't need to 
run... :)
