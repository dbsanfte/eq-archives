Sorry you lost me there how in the world can it be my ISP when I am able to
reach Brell serilis (eqworld-22.989studios.com), Bristlebane
(eqworld-73.989studios.com), and Sullon zek (eqworld-46.989studios.com) and
not Prexus (eqworld-32.989studios.com). It seems to me from there locations
and Verants policy of keep the servers at a central location there shouldn't
be a routing problem with my local ISP
BTW about half hour after talking to GM problem was cleared.
