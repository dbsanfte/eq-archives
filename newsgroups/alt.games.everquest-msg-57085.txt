Does it say your corpse is not in the zone or does it say you are not close
enough to your corpse to drag it?  I went linkdead once and my body was nowhere
near where I went L.D.

If your corpse is in the zone and you can't find it, ask a necro or ranger to
track it.  If it's not (and your corpse hasn't decayed) petition a GM for help.
