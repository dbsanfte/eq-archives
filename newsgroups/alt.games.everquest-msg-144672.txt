Not really. The rich can make choices as bad as the poor, and remain 
rich. If a low-income family makes a bad decision purchasing a house and 
get into a negative equity trap, they are fucked. If a rich family makes 
the same mistake, they shrug it off, or indeed they *still* benefit from 
their bad decision come tax time.

Barring amazing luck or cataclysmic stupidity, "rich" and "poor" are 
self-perpetuating conditions.

Of course, colossal natural resources and an unlimited supply of slaves 
and/or cheap immigrant labor had nothing to do with it...

Nations with a more socially conscious approach to capitalism are just 
as prosperous as the US, when you account for much smaller populations 
and scarcer natural resources.

You won't find any mature "socialist" countries where anybody is at risk 
of missing a meal... :)
