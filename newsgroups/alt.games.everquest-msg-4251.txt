Actually you asked about the group with commentary based on reports from
your "scouts" Getsome, and Butt ranger.

Well, you would be wrong.  I am however offended when someone who
clearly has a normal level of intelligence chooses to present themself
in a manner consistent with someone who would ride a "short bus".  When
someone has a handicap they get the benefit of the doubt, when someone
who has average or above average intelligence behaves in a foolish,
stupid, or ignorant manner, they get both barrels, don't like it?  Deal
with it!

Others who get benefit of the doubt, those posting from a non
.com/.net/.edu, ie .dk, .ch, etc as those have an excuse for poor
english, oddly enough most of them don't need it.
