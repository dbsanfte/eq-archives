See, this is part of the problem.. people thinking that stat buffs
actually *mean* anything.  You're aware that to even see a marginal
increase in your proc rate (and we're talking something to the order
of 5% here), you'd have to have at least an additional 200 dex, right?

The only stat buffs that are even marginally worth the mana involved
in casting are Agility (which will proved a small, yet stackable AC
boost), and Stamina (Which produces a small, yet stackable HP boost).


And even these are only of mild usefulness, worthy of maybe being put
onto main tanks during downtime. Every other stat buff, and I mean
EVERY other stat buff, is going to be a waste.
