   I have to admit, I had not thought of using /who all criteria as a way
to gauge any changes in the population.  I will defer here to those that
have and say there are fewer people playing.

   Interesting if true.  I might even believe it if you throw in the phrase
"if EQ2 is a commercial success" somewhere towards the top of that
paragraph.  I mean, if they learned nothing else from SWG, they much have
learned that players are not guaranteed to flock to whatever MMORPG they
release and stay with it for the long haul.
