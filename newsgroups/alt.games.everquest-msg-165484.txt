Not at all. If ten percent of employers look at color first, where a 
white has ten jobs to choose from, a black only has nine, therefore, his 
access to wealth is unequal.

myself) between immigrating somewhere of your own free will to earn a 
better living, and being dragged there in chains to be a slave for the 
rest of your life.
