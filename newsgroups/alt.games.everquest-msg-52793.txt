Ok.  Go try it.  Tell me what you find.  This is how I understand it to 
work.  Until I see some evidence to the contrary, I shall continue to 
understand it thusly.

At the very least, you could explain how -you- think it works, and how you 
think that correlates with the (admittedly anecdotal) evidence we have 
here of a rogue who had a mob at 25% life KSed from him...  But I find 
your flat, unexplained, denial rather obtuse.
