The free one month trial is the basic game without any expansions. It
is easy enough for basic play. The have an ingame help function that
is ok for starting to play.

Nope it's the free month. They will charge for the second month if you
don't change your billing settings.

You have to go to the billing settings and change them not to be
charged before the month expires. I'd recomend that you do that as
soon after  you create your account as possible so that it won't get
charged unless you make a decision to continue with the game.

All you need to do is load your expansions, enter your CD key after
you log into your trial account and and press the button labeled
Update Owned Expansions and enter your CD key. This will update the
account you started as a free one to include all the expansions you
purchased. You will still have the characters you started.

>4. Will I have access to everything on basic EQ?

Yes.

Yep, happens here too. Maybe not as much, I don't know.
