Go spend a night in WW and listen to the train calls, especially if Sont 
is up.  I spend a good portion of my playtime in WW or the neighboring 
zones, so it's the one I have the most recent experience with.  Trains are 
called all the time there, and every now and then some tool starts to 
complain about not bringing in to SG.  I let the rest of the zone chastise 
him as I run across the zone line as fast as I can.

Which zone edge?  Honestly, wanderers path directly by the tunnel to the 
zone, and there is a chance that the dragons see invis, and I don't know 
of a single spot in WW that doesn't have a chance of a mob pathing by, 
other than the SG and ToV tunnels.

In dungeons, absolutely.  In outdoor zones, I think it's more of a grey 
area.  I have no compassion for someone who dies to a train at the zone 
line, but I also accept the fact that in certain zones, the only safe spot 
is the zone line.

Exactly.  You accept that trains happen, you call your own, and you watch 
out for others.  You most likely do your best to not drop trains on other 
folks, but when you can't avoid it, you accept it as part of the game.  I 
think we agree about 99% of this here.

Actually, as someone who has trained the mushrooms to zone, it's not 
alwasy because we're lazy prats who can't be bothered.  I've run over them 
levitated and invis and aggro'd them.  I was probably 200 feet up when I 
aggrod.  I shouted and zoned as quickly as possible, and still had people 
whining.  Who cares, ignore 'em.  Another good one is Maiden's Eye, the 
idiots who camp at the zone line there, KNOWING that not only will a train 
happen, but the mobs will camp the zone line.
