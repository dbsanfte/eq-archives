Remember a while back when they held one of the BotB or ToT finals on
a production server instead of Test for some reason, and there was
some controversy, because that would give the players from that server
an advantage, because they could use charged items on the first day of
the finals, and then recharge them overnight before the second day?
(The participants from other servers could not do this, because they
aren't allowed to buy/sell) (They finally realized that this totally
sucked, and changed the rules to allow the participants from other
servers to buy and sell to recharge items).

I was not aware that charged items could be recharged, so asked
around, and was told that the way it works is you sell the empty item
to a vendor, and then buy it back, and it has all the charges
restored.

I decided to check that out today, and bought a chipped bone rod,
spent all three charges of "locate corpse", then sold it to a vendor
and bought it back.  It remained empty.

Am I doing something wrong, or did they nerf/fix this trick?
