This argument was beat to death several months ago on Shamans Crucible when
some uber mucky muck posted an analysis on his website trying to show that
shamans were grossly overpowered.  Believe me, the word from shamans who
have been playing the class since the game came out, was that they are NOT
an overpowered class.  They are a powerful and well-balanced class, but they
are not OVER powered.

They have weaknesses that offset their bonuses just like any other class.
Their high level spells are the rarest and most expensive in the game.  Most
shamans don't even have them.  Could you pay 80k each for your two most
pwerful spells? Their slow draws high aggro and their spells take longer and
cost more mana to cast than other classes.  Also at higher levels a lot of
shamans spells are pretty worthless because the stat buffs don't stack and
because at that level a lot of players have maxed stats anyway.  At high
levels shamans lose their place as a healing class.  At 55th level, my max
heal is only 650 pts.  Try using that to keep up with MOBS that hit for
450HP a pop.  It doesn't make a dent.  A cleric can CHEAL and a druid has a
2k heal at that same level.

Not complaining mind you, a shaman is a great class to play, but the class
envy crap is just that.  CRAP.

BTW I think if any class will be nerfed it's the chanter.  That KEI thing is
just WAY out of control you know.
