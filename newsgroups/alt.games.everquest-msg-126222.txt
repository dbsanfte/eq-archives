I once had to log with a corpse past the drop-off in The Hole.  When I
got back on the next day I headed down to the bank  (bound in Katta at
the time, I <hate> that catwalk) to grab some spare gear so I'd be of
use in a group to fight down to my corpse.  I had just gotten to the
banker when "a_random_cleric tells you, 'need a rez?'".  So I said yes,
grabbed 200pp instead of my spare gear, and was more than satisfied
with the cleric's "sweet" in response to the unsolicited 'donation'
he received in return for the unsolicited 96% rez I received.  After
that I just played an alt until a guild wiz was available to run into
The Hole and port me out, was lots better than the hassle of pulling
together a group that could fight down to my corpse (plenty of high
enough chars in the guild, a while back the 55+ folks were doing HoT
once a week, but we're a social guild with very little organization
and it can be like herding cats to put anything together).
