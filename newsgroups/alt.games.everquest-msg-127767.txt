The average lifespan for females in Denmark, IIRC, is hovering around
74. For women in certain parts of northern Russia, it's around 90. In a
*large* number of African countries it's under fifty. If you're a black
male in Detroit, it's even less.

"Keep from growing too fast"?  What exactly do you picture the maximum
seating capacity in this restauraunt to be, anyway?
