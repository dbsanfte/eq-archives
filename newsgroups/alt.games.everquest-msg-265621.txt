Charisma of the warrior (or other tank) is said to affect the liklihood 
of Divine Intervention firing on them.  Pretty damned useful on a raid 
encounter against a mob with realy spikey damage output.

Assuming his resists are not already so high that a few extra points make 
no significant difference...

To me, as a shaman, Delegate MA is not all that helpful, I need to slow 
all the mobs anyway, and I either assist the MA to get his first, or 
debuff the adds first so the CC person can better deal with them, 
depending on the mobs in question.
