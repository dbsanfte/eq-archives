Shats simple.
Some chanter have been playing with the Minor Illusion Spell, and then died.
Have seen in in NFP before when a chanter made around 20 carpets and a 
few jugs that was in front of the bank. For some wierd reason people 
tend to look when theres a big carpeted area that havent been carpeted 
before.

My favorite place to play with minor illusion are in WFP, just at the 
entrance to the Theatre. Theres a little pile of shit nearby, youll turn 
into a HUGE pile of shit, making everyone that run to and from EFP look.
Now i just need to find out if you can be Call Hero'ed out, would be 
cool if you can be CoHd to the gate and still have the shit illision.
