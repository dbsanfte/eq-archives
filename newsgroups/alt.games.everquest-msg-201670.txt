Ok I'll stop with the ghetto talk  ;-)  I just heard about EverQuest.  LOL,
yeah I know you're probably saying "Where did this guy come from?"  Well I
don't play video games that much, but this looks really, really interesting.
Anyways I'm wondering what specs a computer should have in order to play and
support EQ?  I have a Compaq Presario 6000 w/ a Pentium 4 2.4 GHz Processor,
512 MB RAM, I have no idea what kind of video/audio card, Direct X9.  Will
this be enough to run this game?  Where should I start?  Should I just buy
the classic EQ or what?  Like I said I'm very new to this and any
help/advice you experts can give me would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks so
much in advance.

Regards,
Mark
