You need to look at another horse vendor.  Horses come in a number of 
flavors, rope bridle being the cheapest, the higher priced tiers are 
each faster but otherwise identicle.  Further, horses come in four 
colors, and for some reason two of the colors (black and white, IIRC) 
cost more than the  other two by a factor of about 15%, with absolutely 
NO added benefit other than the color itself

Drogmar in Gunthak work the same way, except that there's no higher 
price for different color deal.

You are correct in that charisma isn't going to make things cheaper; 
assuming you are at least indifferent, then prices stop going down at 
106 charisma, which is achievable by almost anyone with a couple opal 
encrusted stiens (may have to remove items like Cazic Thule's Brain 
which have neg charisma)

High level paladins can get a very fast horse with AA points, I think 
(which seems silly since horses are pretty much useless to a melee 
class, even one that uses mana, as  they don't give mana regen while 
attack is turned on), and there's a very fast horse that's drop only, 
and there's a one charge horse item thats dropped/quested, in Befallen I 
think, I've heard quite a few people suggest getting this last to test 
and see if a horse will work for you.

Or you could go to FV and find someone who is willing to trust you 
enough to loan you a drum or bridle and test things out for yourself.
