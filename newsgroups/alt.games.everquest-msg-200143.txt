<snip rant>

I've been playing for about two weeks now and have a lvl 9 Barbarian Shaman
that I'm enjoying more than anything. I started in Halas which seems to be a
good starting point for newbies. I got to around level 4-5 there then headed
over to the Qeynos sewers (aquaduct) and stayed there until level 6. After
that I moved to Blackburrow and have been there since. It is easy when you
start out because if you die there really is no consequence except you have
to memorize your spells all over again. I don't really look to group because
I like to try different things that may or may not be the proper way to do
things but it helps me figure out how to best play the game to MY liking.
It's all about having fun, maybe you could try visiting one of the place I
mentioned to level up easier or try a different character type. I chose a
Shaman because I can melee most of the time but yet still have magic spells
that help out along the way. It sounds like you bought all the expansions so
you should have Planes of Power which lets you use the teleport books to get
to different places without having to get killed along the way.

Just my 2 cents on the matter.
