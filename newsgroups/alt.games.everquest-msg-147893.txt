I carry bandages and arrows for general use.  (stacks of arrow parts and a
fletching kit, really.)
A few small items of resist gear (still not sure why, I never use it.)
Cobalt bracer for shrink indoors.
Shrink potions for shrink outdoors.
Damage shield potions for MT'ing.
I carried my Thurg gate potions for many many months, but sadly I can no
longer get more.
Garish Headdress (+10% Taunt modifier)

Three sets of weapons.
Frostreaver - 2 hander for damage / exp grouping.
Blade of Strategy, warrior epic- MT'ing - big hate proc.
Blade of Tactics, warrior epic - low aggro damage.
Swiftblade of Zek - When not MT'ing, in the main hand for low aggro high
damage (no proc) and when MT'ing, in the off hand for AC / HP,

Usually a stack of peridots or two, and a minimum of 2 invisiblity potions.
