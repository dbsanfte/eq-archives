Answering your last question first:  I would like to believe that
there is at least one person on the SOE dev staff who either knows
how melee works, or at least knows where to look to figure it out.
;)

As for the rest of your post, when most people (myself included)
discuss weapon damage here it is in context of melee characters.
Non-melees use an inferior "damage table", which apparantly has
as one of its features a lower max hit cap than the melee tables
(some melees get better than others, but all are better than the
INT casters and priest classes).

hth,
