Rangers gladly have rangers in group but other ppl are often more hesitant
to take them. They are just underraed by the ppl but they are an excellent
class. Thy are somewhere between monks, pallies and druids. depending on
where i'm hunting/grouping there are times i like to trade in a warrior or a
chanter for a ranger. Though mostly the groups think you really need those
classes. But then again i like to play in lousy balanced groups and finding
solutions for the things we lack. A group of a chanter 3 wizzies and 2
druids can rock certain places but is rarely seen. Balanced groups often
causes ppl to stick to their assumed standard role while less balanced
groups makes ppl all of a sudden versatile and make them learn much more
about what other classes can and can't do.

65 and all the aa's filled makes any class overpowered for a lot of zones;
time to create a new character enjoy the tradeskills and everything else
what hasn't be done yet.
