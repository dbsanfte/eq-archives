I can't get the boat to Gunthak to work.  I know I'm loy enabled because I
was able to create and login a froglok.  But when I went to the boat and
clicked on the door it wouldn't work.  I see other people walk up to it and
disappear but for me it does not work.  I also talked to other people that
said it doesnt work for them either.  Does anyone have any idea what I could
do to make it work?
