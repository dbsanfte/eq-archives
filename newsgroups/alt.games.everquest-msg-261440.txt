Deep in the midst of 8.3 you have the line

  If the enchanter in your group has a green bar under their red HP bar 
(in the group window) it means they have charmed a pet.    Same goes for 
bards.

While this is true of bards, it isn't necessarily true of enchanters, 
who can summon pets.  Irritating pets that don't listen to a thing they 
say, unless they are quite high level and have invested in AA that allow 
them the commands everyone else got at level one.

It also is true of druids, who can charm animals, and even on occaision 
of magicians, who at 65+ can charm elementals.

There is no way, by looking at the group window, to tell if the 
enchanter has an Animation (summoned pet) or charmed mob.

If you have a mob targetted and can't hit it or land spells on it, its 
probably a charmed mob.  One way to check is to con the mob, charmed 
pets will come up as Indifferent, except to the charmer, for whom they 
will come up as Allied.

Charmed mobs tend to be much more powerful than summoned mobs, hitting 
harder and having much higher HP totals.  However, ordinary charmed mobs 
can break charm and will then have the charmer on top of their aggro list.

Another type of charmed pet is the Dire Charm, achievable only with AA; 
this allows a relatively low level mob to be charmed nearly permanently 
(for hours rather than minutes), trading power for safety, and still 
probably more powerful than the enchanter's normal summoned animation 
(certainly more powerful than the druid's summoned pet, which is much 
the same as a 34 shaman's summoned pet)
