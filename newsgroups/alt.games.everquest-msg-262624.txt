    To get there, hail a Priest of Discord (there's a new one in Knowledge, 
outside the front door of the library a ways). I believe the phrase you have 
to tell them is "I wish to go to Discord", and they port you there. You end 
up in Dranik's Scar, where there's Priests of Discord that will send you 
home as well. There's a quest that the Elder Priest of Discord there will 
give you for a druid port to some of the zones deeper in the expansion - you 
can buy most (all?) of the parts you need to turn in at the Bazaar.

    I'd suggest loading the maps from EQToolbox ( 
http://mapfiend.eq-toolbox.com/ ). The only thing you may need to know that 
isn't on the maps is this: in Dranik's Scar are a series of caves on the 
eastern wall of the zone. There's an NPC in front of those caves that gives 
out instances for adventures within. A lot of people are camping their 
lower-level spells in those instances, such as the Murkglider Caves 
instance. So if someone asks you to go to the Dranik's instances or to 
Murkglider Caves, that's where they mean. Good luck!
