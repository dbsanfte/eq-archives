My Paladin is level 11 and currently carries a Bronze Two-Handed Sword (2HS,
9/47) and a Fine Steel Scimitar (1HS, 5/24) along with a round shield for
bashing. I hunt around Western Karana, Qeynos Hills, and Blackburrow area.
I'm looking to upgrade these weapons and also get some that will bring up my
1HB, 2HB and Piercing skills (2HS is 57 and 1HS is 59 right now). I've got
about 20 platinum in all. What weapons should I be looking for, where, and
how much would they likely cost?
