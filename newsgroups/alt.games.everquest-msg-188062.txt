What's going on? I have never played EverQuest before. I am thinking about
checking it out. I am having a problem trying to find some information. How
much is EQ a month or however it goes? Is there anything special for new
users? Also I am trying the best deal to get, I have seen the Gold edition
has all the add-on's but it also has a lot of other stuff that I don't think
I'll ever need or use. Can some one recommend me what to get or if there is
a bundled package that just has the software and maybe a map or something?



If someone can help me out I would appreciate it! Thanks for your time!



Jess
