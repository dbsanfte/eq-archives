If you have an AMD, it might not be your computer.  I have had similiar problem
ever since the move to the dx8.1 engine.  I have tried all of the solutions in
the message board at the EQ page and they have at least made the new Luclin
zones playable, but a few old areas, like Rivervale and East Freeport, are very
jerky.  According to one of the developers, it could be a conflict with  AMD
processors and the Umbra graphics engine.

See the Casters Realm posting at:

I keep trying fixes people post, but since this is being seen by a few people
(see the EQ message board thread about AMD frame rate posts where they ask for
people's specs), I hope a fix will come soon.

Regards,
John
