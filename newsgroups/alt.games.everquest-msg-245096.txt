So describe this class balancing act.  Does it still exist?  If it does not
then what it keeping the harmony of the classes from taking place?  Is the
game balanced more towards casters than melees?  If so then why and how is
it fixable?  Seriously, the whole class balance argument is a red herring
that is tossed out into these discussions far too often.  I am not
interested in the nerfage of other classes or the creation of the perfect
super class that can do everything.  I just want a class that more
accurately represents the type of warrior that the name implies.

I played SWG for awhile after it first came out and loved the Teras Kasi
Artist class.  A friend of mine played a Wookiee Teras Kasi Artist and loved
it.  Going against a skilled TKA master you would not want to let them get a
hold of you.  You would definitely want to attack them from a distance.  If
a TKA master got close enough to grab you then you would be in a world of
hurt.  With all the problems SWG had I do think they did a better job of
making a martial artist that more accurately reflected the "Bruce Lee" style
of fighting than anyone else has up to now.
