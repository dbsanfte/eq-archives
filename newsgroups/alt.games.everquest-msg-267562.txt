   We can play the "what if" game all day, of course.  Pass a certain
point, the chances of serious harm go down to virtually zero.  Not actually
zero, of course, but close enough.  We take a chance on dying every time we
eat, drive to work, take a shower, or watch reruns of "Mama's Family" on
tv.  Life is an exercise in risk assessment.

   I've been sorta seeing your point up to this, but here I have to say,
"Bullshit".  Are you forgetting there is a thief at work here?  Or do you
think that its perfectly fine for anyone to take anything that isn't nailed
down?  Do you think there are no criminals in the world, just stupid people
who didn't take the necessary precautions to not get victimized?  I'm
willing to own up to the fact that I might be being a jerk here, but to say
I'm the only one is plain wrong.  I am not forcing anyone to take my stuff.

   The fridge is a resource provided by my employer for the express purpose
of giving us employees a place to store our lunches.  That is what I was
using it for.  I am not using it to store highly desirable items like large
denominational bills.  I am now unable to use that resource for its
intended purpose because someone has taken it upon themselves to make the
situation unworkable.  Again, you can play "What if?" until you are blue in
the face, but the fact is that I am not doing anything wrong at all by
storing the lunch in the factory's lunchroom fridge.

   Fuck that.  I blame the thief.

   Cute analogy, but wrong in this case.  The mobs are not mine.  They are
there for anyone to use who has paid the $15 dollar monthly entrance fee to
the game.  Player convention has it that one respects camps, and I always
have when I played.  If I had a camp, and someone came by and insta-killed
what I was waiting for the moment it spawned I would contact that person's
guild, or failing that bitch about them on the server's forum in an attempt
to inform people about the type of player he is.  What I wouldn't do is
train them.  See?  You really don't what kind of an idiot I am as well as
you thought you did!

    Someone on usenet who sees something in a different light.  And that's
fine, that's the fun of usenet for me.  I mean, I would prefer it if you
were mature enough to realize that the fact that someone else has a
different viewpoint that you doesn't automatically make them an idiot, but
I accept you limitations in this regard.

    And you're the type that thinks that any woman that gets raped deserved
it because she was stupid enough to walk out of her house without wearing a
chastity belt and accompanied by an armed security guard.  Hey, you're
right!  Making unfounded, slippery slope arguments *is* fun!  

   Anyways, I see that you and I are clearly coming from different places
on this issue.  And that's fine, I understand that there is more than one
viewpoint out there.  However, I don't think that either of us are likely
to convince the other the error of their ways.  I also predict that our
disagreement on this issue will lead to more ad hominem attacks.  I'm not
particularly skilled at making those, so I hope you will excuse me while I
drop this conversation with you.
