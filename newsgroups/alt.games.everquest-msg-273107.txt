Why would people who want to race up congregate on the overpopulated
servers any more than people who don't?  I'd expect it's more "people
who were excited about the game and created their characters on the
very first day", plus everyone who wanted to play with them, that are
suffering from the queues.  I don't see a connection between this and
levelling up as fast as possible.
