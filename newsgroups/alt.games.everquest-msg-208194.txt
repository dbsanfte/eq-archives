Yes, not a big deal at least at the lower levels though. Money is easy
to come by and item decay is slow and cheap to fix (although there is
a chance of destroying an item when you try to repair it). If they put
this in as a money sink, it isn't working.

Hard to judge but it still has major annoying bugs.

Yes. It seems to work well for the tradeskillers and people doing the
non-fighting skills that you can learn in town but for the combat
classes it's a lot more boring than EQ ever was. There just wasn't any
interesting content that I found (and it's what made me decide to
cancel my account). The terminal hunting missions are trivial to run
and make money, you can't really run any NPC missions because over
half of them are broken in some way and what should have been the
dungeons (theme parks) are as boring as the terminal missions from
what little I saw of them. You also don't get that sense of danger
that you had in EQ when exploring dangerous, high level areas. 

Even as a lowbie in EQ, I had places like Crushbone, Blackburrow,
Befallen, Unrest, to pull me in, There's nothing like it in SWG.
