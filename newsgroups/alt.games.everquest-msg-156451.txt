Sounds okay to me.

I see nutty deals there sometimes. Rather than break the bank for a
bane warding shield or someting lately I've been seeing a

Skull marked shield
ac 22
wis 7
Hp 50 mana 50 (!!!!!)

for like 6 or 7 k. 

Today I was trying to raise some cash and noticed one was
2400 plat.... someone snagged it before I could. Later one was
2800.. ditto.. SNAGGED. My druid already has like 252 wis wit no
wisdom on her shield (white dragon.. for resists) so this one would be
about right and plus mana and hp.
