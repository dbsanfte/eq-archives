Hi everyone:

After installing SoL, I've noticed that when I type anything, be it Tells,
Says or other chat mode type writing, the small underline cursor gets
farther and farther away (to the right) from my text, and this is VERY VERY
annoying. Has anyone alse encontered this, and if so, were you able to stop
this from occuring?


Example: /tell Newsgroup Hi, I hope this is able to show what is happening
with my problem              _

Insdead of: /tell Newsgroup Hi, I hope this is able to show what is
happening with my problem _


Many thanks in advance ...

Stevie.
