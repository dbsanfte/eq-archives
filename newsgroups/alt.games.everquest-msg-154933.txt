If the KEI-ee is willing to wait for nearly a full group 50p is fine.  And
THANK YOU for not sending tells.  You're right...most of the time there are
KEI casters in either Nexus or Bazaar.  I hate having to remember to go
/role and remove my epic as soon as I enter Nexus.

I had a guy in SEBILIS "guard" camp (the camp across from the exit...I've
never seen a froggy guard so I don't know where the name comes from...I
obviously don't spend a lot of time in Seb :) ) walk up to me and hand me
40p and then ask me for a KEI.   He explained that he's been waiting a
couple hours for me to be close enough to KEI him without him getting killed
(we were in chef/bar).  I hit Cancel and said informed him that I wasn't a
vending machine.

So he said "oh, I put the wrong amount in" and handed me a whopping
73p...fully expecting me to KEI him.

Sorry, but if you're (whomever...obviously not you, Richard) going to treat
me like your own little combo vending machine/whore, the price is 500+.  For
500+ plat I'll be your bitch for 12 seconds (casting time).
