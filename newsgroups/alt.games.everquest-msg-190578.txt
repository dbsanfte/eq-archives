If I had a nickel for every time anybody (most definitely including
myself) made a faulty assumption about an EQ game mechanic because
"it would seem logical", I could've retired a couple years ago and
would now be selling the mountains of excess coins as scrap metal.

Hmm, sounds to me as if you did in fact pull the mob off the other
toon with your successful taunt.  Hardly your fault that the other
person ungraciously continued attacking and regained the hate lead.

Momentarily exceeding it even.  This is the point where you get right
top of the mob (if not already there) to try and squeeze a bit more
proximity agro.

Additional taunts are not necessary unless you and the RNG should
decide it's a good time for a whiff-fest.  If your attacks are
averaging more agro than your competitor's you are about to take
and hold agro.  And if your competitor is generating more hate than
you you'll be taunting until the end of the fight because taunt
only gets you to (top of hate list + 1).  See if you can find an
old timer Ranger and ask them what it was like during the first
months after Kunark came out.  Knights were crippled jokes, their
lovely little anti-hate self-buff did not yet exist, and so the
only thing keeping the mobs from smearing them was the Warrior's
taunt, which didn't (doesn't) work on mobs higher level than the
Warrior at all.  But the level restriction didn't matter much,
because a taunted mob would _always_ turn back on the Ranger
quickly.  My highest character was sub-40 then, but I heard many
tales of raids in which _all_ of the Rangers died.

Figure out a reasonable build-hate-over-time ability for Warriors.

That would mitigate their current woes without stepping all over
the greatest strength of the Knights.  With the ability to build
hate beyond their attack frequency and DPS, and without resorting
to the "uber" gear which is the rather lame band-aid SOE has tried
applying to the issue, a decent group would do well once they
developed suitable tactics for the critical start of battle time
(and if they can't do that, TFB).
