Weird, I spent the 7 months over there for Shield and Storm, and was
given various injections for the concern of chemical agents.
NAP(nerve agent protection) pills
Anthrax shots
Malaria (think they were shots.. had so many of them)

I have given blood numerous times and have notified the donation bank
of my service... they took my blood with no issue.
what did they give you to nullify your donation?

Just curious.

Peace and good hunting
