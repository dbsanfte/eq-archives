The traditional way to handle it is to have the group find a safe place to
stay and have a puller attack a mob and lead it back to the group.  That way
you have the best chance of dealing with mobs one on one in a relatively
safe environment.  The puller can run up and physically attack the mob, then
run back to camp, but if you have spells available it makes more sense to
use those to aggro the mob from a distance.  "Pulling" works much better
than a helter-skelter "follow the leader" approach, which is what my friends
and I did when we were newbies.  People were always getting lost and the
casters were always running instead of sitting and medding.
