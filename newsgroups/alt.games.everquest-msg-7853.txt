I know that feeling.. my first char was a barbarian warrior. She scrimped
and saved to buy that first non-rusty bastard sword. I think I paid 16pp for
it from a vendor. Then I sold a couple HQ pelts and was able to buy banded
armor. I remember how 75pp felt like an absolute fortune! My monk was very
poor until I won some money in a guild event and was able to buy a fighting
baton and some other gear.

Spell casters have it tough. I tried starting an Erudite enchanter and got
SO frustrated by how much the spells cost, and how bad the loot was in Tox
Forest (pre-Warrens). I wound up deleting her because she wasn't agnostic,
and I then twinked another enchanter with 50pp from my warrior. Even that
won't get her past the level 8 spells (she's only level 3). And, I've got a
druid who's dirt poor. Haven't figured out how to get her enough money to
buy level 9 spells and something better than a rusty mace. I got stacks of
batwings in the bank just waiting for a buyer! :-)

Anyhow, don't worry! You'll get some good loot as you get up in levels!  In
the meantime, there are some good ways to make money at low levels. The best
I found was CB belts - on Lanys they sell for 1pp each, and my HE mage was
able to finance all her spells pretty easily. At level 8 I think she had
more money than my level 20-ish monk! :-)
