So?  Sony has made it pretty clear they have moved the focus away from the
level 1-20 game.  All the changes they made to the very low-end game -
faster XP, all gear goes with you when you die, no XP penalty - makes it
quite clear that they are interested in getting people past level 20 as
quickly as possible.  Yes, they spent a lot of time developing level 20 and
under zones three years ago, but right now their focus is on much higher-end
zones.

Which makes sense, since the majority of their playing base is well above
level 20.

So being able to twink out a new character for very little plat is not a
problem - it's by design.  I certainly don't see it as the "root of most
problems in the game".

They've found other incentives - quests, no-drop items, etc - to get you to
try slightly more dangerous content.  My froglok alt has been hunting in
Dulak for the sole purpose of getting his level 45 spell there.

I don't necessarily disagree with that statement.  I just disagree that it's
the "root of most problems in the game", is all.
