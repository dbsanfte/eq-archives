LOL, I knew that after beta! In the last 3 weeks of beta, every change made it 
worse than it had been prior to that. Lag in Antonica went from reasonable, to 
often being unable to cast a spell.

Plus, all classes I tried seemed to have the same "feel". I had wanted to try 
the Betrayal quest, but never got around to it. No matter, as my wiz was in his 
20's at the end so he was to high a level to do the Quest in any event.
