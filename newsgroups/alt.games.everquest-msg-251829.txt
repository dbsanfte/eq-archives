No comments here, I think it's great when casters melee. :) Then again, I'm
a battle cleric myself. *grin*

Anyway, I don't really know what damage 'bonus' is given to
non-traditional-melee characters, but I do see a pattern with your weapons.
Your dagger has 11 damage; your staff has 25 damage (currently). You're
hitting for 23 max with dagger, 37 max with staff. 23 - 11 = 12, 37 - 25 =
12. Sounds like you're getting a damage 'bonus' of 12 for each weapon, so
that would be a consistent thing. :) Of course, I'm just going by these 2
weapons so I dunno. I DO know that when I was (until just recently) using my
pile driver, which hits for 30 damage, I was getting a max of 115-120 damage
with it (actual melee damage, not the procs). Now that I've switched to a
withering staff of agony, I'll have to watch to see what my max hits are (so
far, no where near the pile driver, but then the staff has half the damage
as the pile driver...but half the delay too, so it should equal out in the
long run).

Hope that helps in some way and I'm not just wasting your time here. :)
