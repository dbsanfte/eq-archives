Funny, spend time in LOIO or even OT (looks like the Lake posse have
graduated to the Overthere) and you'll here plenty about how their class
"0wns" or  "r0x0rs" and on and on...
I know EQ is an addictive and emersive game. I know I have spent whole
weekends playing it, not actually going out for any reason other than to
shop but some people must lead really empty lives if the best they can do to
bolster there egos is to brag about how great the class they chose to play
is. They're not even bragging that it's them that "r0x0rs" in duels, at
least I could stomach someone bragging about their own ability, nope.
But, get them in a forum with a member of VI present and it's another story,
lol.

It's like Micheal Schumacher saying "Of course I won, I drive a Ferrari,
Ferrari's 0wn. Mclaren sux0rs"
