}>Gnoll		(Evil)
}Not all gnolls are evil. See places like Iceclad and Jaggedpine, for
}instance.

This is one reason they'd be my most realistic choice.  
Choice of starting cities:  
  zones off Jaggedpine and Splitpaw.  
Choice of Deity:  
  Agnostic, Brell, Fippy.  
Choice of Classes:  
  Warrior, Cleric, Mage, Enc, maybe Paladin, Shaman, Wiz, Bst, Monk or 
  Ranger.

But if we can pick -anything-, I gotta go with fairy.

Also, I've never been sure that even the KoS to all gnolls are evil, per 
se.  They seem more isolationist than evil.
