You're much better off grouping for faction since hits aren't shared 
like exp. More people kill more giants and get more faction hits.

Go into kael and see if you can find a group fighting for faction and 
ask if you can tag their mobs (you need to hit mobs to get faction hits, 
being grouped is not enough, heals sometimes give faction hits but not 
reliable). You can get pretty much to the arena with invis so I suggest 
running from one zoneline to bank and out to the other zone looking for 
a group.
