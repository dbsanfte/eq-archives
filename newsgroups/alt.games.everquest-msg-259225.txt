I've observed something over my 55 levels as a berserker that is really 
confounding me.

To put it simply, I seem to be faster than mobs.

When I pull, I can generally get back to the party before the mobs start 
beating on me; I can put that down to good ranged pull techniques.

But even when they -do- catch me, I can just jump once or twice to gain 
headway, and then run to the group without them catching up again.

Last night, I was in ME near UP, waiting for an LD guildmate; I was 
invis, my SOW faded, then he came back, I got his body, but a see invis 
mob slapped me and broke my invis.  I ran all the way across ME with 
that mob and up to 10 adds on my tail, and the only times I got hit were 
when the new adds were more or less in my path; a jump or two each time 
to get headway and I was golden.

As I remember it, getting Run 1 was a huge moment in my cleric's life, 
because this meant instead of mobs being faster than him, he was faster 
than them.  And run 2 was worth it because he wasn't -much- faster, and 
got slapped a lot at doorways and the like.  Run 3 was just the icing on 
the cake, making him as fast as he could get without SOW, and allowing 
him to stop worrying about TBoots.

My berserker, on the other hand, can't seem to get motivated to stop 
leveling up to grab this AA I once thought crucial; he already has the 
brass ring, he's "faster than mobs"

Weren't most mobs about 5% faster than PCs?

Is it a barbarian thing?  A berserker thing?  An artifact of the Dx9 
changes?

Or I recall hearing once that they changed low level mob run speeds to 
make things easier for newbies.  Did they instead change everyone's run 
speed, or all mob's run speeds, so that instead of mostly being faster 
than us, we are all faster than most of them?
