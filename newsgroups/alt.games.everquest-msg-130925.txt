Of course they do.   Anyone who has played a high level cleric can
tell you the same story.    I will happily go rez anyone whenever I'm
not otherwise occupied, which is a good definition for "during raid
formup" if and only if I have a port to and from.  Resposibility of the
dead guy to provide one.  Hmm, might explain why I rez druids and
wizards so much more than other classes, here I thought it was just
because they are fragile!

Nonetheless, running around rezing dead people in the time before
raid starts is a frequent part of the job.  Often people die and then
deliberately log out and wait for the next raid when they can be
pretty sure a guild cleric will be logged on before coming back.

Course the guild normally has several clerics per raid, so I'm
not in the position of the ONLY porter in a raid force, not by
a long shot... but your statement that it doesn't happen at all
still doesn't stand unchallenged
