Lucky break, mostly. Long ago (1995-ish) I wrote a program for my own
use, and a friend showed it to the people he was working for. They
liked it and bought a license, and then wanted custom versions, then
wanted other programs, and it sort of snowballed. And along the way
I've picked up occasional other clients as well.

It's "who you know" as much as anything.
