Hey, you don't need 50 for that - 47 should suffice :) (A friend of
mine started the evening by complaining I should be 5 levels higher,
since he was on a Fear raid with no druids present. An hour later he
told me I have to get level 59, since he currently had level 59 druid
buffs and had taken a liking to them. My goal is to be a wanderer
before the end of summer... )
