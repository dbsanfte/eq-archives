Well, having just gone on my first raid (Chardok Overking, a wipe), I figure
it's time to re-asses my gear.  Understand, I'm a pally, so I'm naturally
poverty-stricken.  None the less, how does this look?

I know Magelo is the preferred format, but I can't get it to work well, so
I'll stick with good ol' Allakhazam's.  BTW, when I'm not going 1H, I'm
using my Arbitor's Combine Greatsword.  And don't ask about resist gear (
;_;  ) that consists of my Shieldstorm.

Thanks in advance.
