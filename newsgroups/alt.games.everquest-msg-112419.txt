Ok folks, this group has always been able to answer my questions in the
past, hope you can help me this time.
Ever since SoL has come out, seems there are random times where everything
just freezes in place. Doesn't matter the zone, combat or non-combat.
Doesn't matter if there are 4 people in the zone or 40. Happens when I am on
dial-up or broadband. Happens on 2 different machines. Machines exceed
hardware recommendations on all accounts.
I thought I had heard something about this kind of problem and it stemmed
from when other people would zone in or out of the zone I am in. If that's
the case, doesn't seem like much I can do about it. On the other hand, is
there some setting on disk cache or memory usage I can tweak? Thanks for any
help.
