For a brief moment, the thought crossed my mind...we have several
Tunare-ians that post here, why not open a chat channel for ageq

Of course, that thought was quickly squashed by the thought that, with
that much open communication between us in-game, we might end up
killing each other. ;-) If anyone wants to risk it, we could give it a
go, though.
