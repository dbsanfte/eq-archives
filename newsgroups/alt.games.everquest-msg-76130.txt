I have searched high and low for a website devoted to both Enchanters,
Clerics and Magicians with no -real- success.

The ones I've found either list just the epic quest, spells listings or
whatever single tid bit of information they may list.

For Wizards, its www.graffe.com this I know.. for Druids, well a bit more
higher on the obvious scale, thats www.eqdruids.com so I thought wellll..

www.eqenchanters.com (doesn't exist)  oh and yes there is a www.eqshaman.com
another one that hit the top of obvious domains.

I do know about www.bjornstar.com however that lists only the epic that I
can tell.  I have two newbie friends that just started the game and while I
can tell them just about anything they would like to know (just about
anyway) it would be nice to point them in the direction of... a website.
<grin>

Anyway, I know this group is full of knowledgable people, so I will leave
this in your hands.  Any help is appreciated as always and hell, this
wouldn't be a post without a flame (for whatever ungodly reason) being a
response from atleast -one- person.
