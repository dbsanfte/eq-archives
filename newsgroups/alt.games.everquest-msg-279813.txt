Part of why it's so easy to fall into the "buy upgrades" trap is that
it's actually hard to find level-appropriate things to spend money on
after a while.  Those bandages, food, and so forth don't get any more
expensive as you level up, but you're making much more plat (including
selling vendor trash) from the mobs you kill.  Tradeskill components
can of course consume an infinite amount of plat, and if you're a
caster the spells do get more expensive as you level, but I expect
you'll find you're accumulating plat and, as you say, it's reasonable
to expect you should spend it on something.

One thing you might consider allowing, with care, is purchasing level-
neutral gear, provided you can earn the money for it.  E.g., it's
unlikely anyone in your guild will be making Leatherfoot Haversacks
for a while, given the tailoring skill needed.  But if your accumulated
plat is enough to buy one in the Bazaar, you might allow that.  I.e.,
for stuff that drops off mobs, or requires travel to certain zones, it's
easy to see what level you need to be for it to be level-appropriate,
but for things that really ARE obtained by paying another player to do
the work, you might define the appropriate level as being whatever level
you're at when you decide you've got the plat to spare.  (I agree that
farming just to raise the plat is best avoided.)
