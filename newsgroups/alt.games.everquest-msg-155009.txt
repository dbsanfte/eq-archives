Rains won't always suck for the OP.  I thought so too once, but someone here
in age set me right on that maybe a year back.  At level 52, wizards get
Tears of Druzzil, which does 3x600 for 380 mana versus 1120 for 400 mana
from Ice Comet.  Granted, Ice Comet isn't quite as efficient as the
draughts, but it is in the same ballpark.

You can see that, if 2 out of 3 waves of rain hit (assuming a single pull
here), you did better with the rain than you could have with IC.  I can tell
you from experience that 2 or 3 waves will almost always hit the level of
mobs you'll face during a standard exp grind.  So I prefer Tears of Druzzil
to standard DD whenever the situation makes it practical.

There's the rub with the rains, though.  They are much more specialized than
standard DD.  You cannot use them solo, as the first wave will almost always
break root.  You should be very, very careful about using them in
multi-level dungeons, as you could easily start an enormous train from deep
within the place.  And you should avoid using them with more than a single
pull (screw that 4th wave that gets wasted!), as your group likely has some
way of handling adds, be it mez, root, or even tank mezzing, that will be
hurt more than helped by that wave of rain damage.  Lastly, be careful using
the rain in close quarters -- Tears will put you down very quickly if you
get inside it before it runs its course.

Those few exceptions aside, you should find, from level 52, that there are
plenty of situations where you'll want a rain in spell slot 1.  Believe it .
. . or not.
