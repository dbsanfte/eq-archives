We are certainly not a pure capitalist society anymore. However the problems
of a pure capitalist society can be fixed in that same society. As a matter
of fact they where fixed here before we started down the socialist road to
'the great society' . Capitalism at is basis is that any 2 people who freely
wish to engage in trade are not restricted from doing so. It also contains
the notion that what you work for is yours, no one elses to take ,without
compensation YOU decide on.

You have no real knowledge of history . You condemn the society that put
children to work while not mentioning that in most places in the world at
that time a death rate among children was 50%, and they lived in far worse
conditions than merely working :p here with the great evil of children
working the death rate was maybe 5%? You I hope do realize that children get
the summer off from school so that they can bring in the crops for the next
winter, a holdover from many years ago.
