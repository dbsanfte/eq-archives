Agreed, a Fungi is a lot harder to get, going for about 50k these days
on BB. But at least you don't loose money on it, You can equip a Fungi
for 60 lvls, sell it and make all your money back. That does tend to
balance out the money you waste on KEI imo.

Irrelevant given caliber of equipment out there these days, wearing a
fungi in your chest slot up through 50th lvl isn't really a sacrifice.

Especially at 30+, I'll agree that you're more limited as far as
targets go with a soloing melee. You can't just assume that if it's
blue, you can take it easily. But when you do find the right camp, I
still think you can exp faster than any caster with KEI.

Having also recently done both (troll warrior and froggie wizard), I
couldn't disagree more. Except for the Fungi and very good weapons,
the troll doesn't have very good equipment (under 900ac at 39th lvl).
Dual wielding a LSoEE and wurmy/SoS/decent (10/20) piercer, he'll kill
faster than a quadder with KEI. I did it all the time in Iceclad
hunting cougars. 

My wizard is only in his teens and doesn't get played unless I've
bummed a KEI and usually PotG from friends, is a pretty massive twink
(mainly HP equipment) and even in his teens he won't keep up withe the
troll. Wizard has to hunt in spots with room to maneuver so he doesn't
get hit, troll went to the dungeons with high exp modifiers. Wizard
has to deal with resists, does a lot of running to get a kill set up,
warrior wades into a good spot and kills non-stop. Wizard needs sow
potions (added cost), troll doesn't bother since I can always strafe
run to zone if I get in over my head.
