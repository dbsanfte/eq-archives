    Curious you mention balance issues and need of new quests, then mention
DAoC. It's my understanding that one of the servers in DAoC, the one with
Conquest on it (Merlin?), is done. Conquest PLed all their side up as fast
as humanly possible and conquered both of the enemy realms. Game over,
unless you want to either be on Conquest's side and mindlessly protect what
you've got, or play on Team Frustration and get chain-ganked into next year
trying to get back a single objective. And HOW long has that game been out
for?
