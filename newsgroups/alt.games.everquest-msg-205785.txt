Kaev my second character (I deleted the first at L4 before making
Kaev) moved from Freeport to GFay at L4.  Gave a thousand thanks to
the kind Enchanter who bound him for a 2gold tip and started in on
those foul Crushbone Orcs.  Many CRs later, at L6 (or maybe it was
L7, it all gets so hazy with time), the friend who had cruelly lured
me into trying EQ discovered Fletching and Archery with his Ranger,
and immediately clued me in.  So Kaev spent his pathetic savings on
a Fletching kit and started making arrows.  Had nothing to do with
buying or selling gear or the bazaar (this was in the summer of '99
on Tunare server, back when GFay was just another newbie zone before
it became the auction zone on that server).

Yep.  I was so proud of my Finesteel 2h sword and Banded armor that it
really hurt a lot to have to sell one of my 5 pieces of Banded to get
enough cash to buy my very first magic weapon, a Combine Longsword.
Of course, this was long after I had become an archer/fletcher.  When
Kaev learned to fletch there was one (yes, exactly one) smith selling
Banded armor in GFay, and his prices were quite high.  This was at
least six months before the 1pp per ac "standard" price for Banded
became common on Tunare.  Later characters had less trouble hanging on
to their pennies than Kaev.  Why, my Wood Elf Ranger didn't even have
to buy food!  and he tailored a full suit of patchwork for himself
from pelts dropped by L1 mobs, made his first bow before he dinged L5,
man that was livin!  (Thank you Felwithe mail run!)  My first Warrior
made his living selling arrows to twinked lowbies, he bought his early
weapons and armor with his fletching profits.
