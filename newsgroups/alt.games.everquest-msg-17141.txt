At 15 you can go hunting Bandits in the Karana's. Find yourself a group and
try to get as much bronze and sashes as you can. Bring the sashes to a guy
near the palli guild in Qeynos (forgot his name, but you can find it on
Allakhazam). He'll give you some gold, exp and a bronze weapon.
I farmed the hills bandit camp and farm in WK and the shore camp in NK when
I was lvl 27 and got bored of the damn gnolls in SK. The sashes quest
actually gave me some exp as well, plus about 50pp an hour or so (that is
camping 2 sites and getting all the loot).
