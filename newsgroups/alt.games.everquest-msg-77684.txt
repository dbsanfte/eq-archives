I admit it's been a while, a long while, since I've ever made patchwork but I
always thought that if you put a ruined pelt and a pattern (say, wrist band
pattern) in a sewing kit and combinded them then, provided it worked, you got a
patchwork wrist band. Why is it then that my Bard, who found himself collecting
a good number of ruined cat pelts whilst hunting puma's in Steamfont, only
recieves tattered armour for his tailoring efforts? Is it still possible to make
patchwork?

Thanks in advance. :)
