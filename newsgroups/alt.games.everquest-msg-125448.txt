Man the little tricks I never knew.

So if you target someone, then hit tab, you target yourself, hit tab
again and you target them again.  This locks them in some sort of
tab buffer.

Now go to targetself and set the second slot to E
then go to targetselect and set the second slot there to E as well

OK, pick a target.  Hit Tab Tab.  Now whenever you
hit E you will pick out -that- target as long as its alive and
in targetting range.

This is -astonishingly- handy for my bard, since I lock
in my pet victim.  Now I can switch to a target, tell pet
to attack it, then selo the target, DD the target, and
swap back to my pet to redo charm... sure I could
do this before by doing F1 F1... unless the charm
broke before I got back to my pet.  Since its -vital-
that I recharm the same pet again and again, being
able to pick him out of  a crowd reliably is making a huge
difference.

I also find it handy for my cleric.  Now instead of
making a special social key for the MA, I lock him
in the target buffer, so any time I want I can go to him
with an E.  This leaves another slot for more
useful hotkeys, and when we switch MAs it takes me
only a second to target new guy, tab tab and lock him
in till he gets demoted again.  I'm free to assist assist assist
to find raid mates being beat on, since I can always
get back to my principle heal target of the moment,
be it MA, SA, chanter...whatever the most important
person to keep alive may be, even if that person is
changing on the fly.

Found this on a bard site by the way, EQDiva
