Have you told that to everyone posting about the events of the 11th or using
it as way to only slam me?

Conspiracy theories? Did the 11th not happen? Did not 2 US Embassies get
bombed? Did not a US Naval ship get crippled with substantial losses? Did
other US sites not also get attacked in the last 10 years? What does it take
for you to wake up? USA is being stalked and attacked whenever possible.
That means everyone in the USA is under attack, period. If you want to
dismiss it fine, you want to call me names fine, don't dissuade people from
doing some tiny things that could help their family survive the rest of
their lives...

This isn't "get letter, take it to orc at Crushbone"... This is protect
yourself so you can enjoy those same games in the future...

As more smaller countries get access to the big problematic technologies,
hell *will* break loose. If you are in a zone of quarantine, you are *on
your own*. The words from the government are not "we have plans to save
you.", they are words of, "We will be able to protect you from any problem
that occurs.". Translated that means very simply, we will quarantine any
area with problems, we will put a fence around it so it won't spread, and
anyone inside is on their own... That's REALISTIC. I don't blame them at
all. The message here is, REALIZE that your options, if in those zones of
quarantine are limited to your planning ahead.
