I did this recently with fletching.  Luckily, I wasn't going for skill-ups 
and just making the crap arrows.

I did it once with a stack of enchanted silver bars, but they weren't too 
expensive for me at the time.

I'm sure there are -millions- of "Oh shit, I hit combine!" stories from 
back when you could combine anything unsuccessfully.  I've had a few, but 
nothing major.
