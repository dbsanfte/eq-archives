Guk has always been a little more difficult because of the narrow winding
passages with inclines, and dark rooms that make it hard to see how many may
add.  The dx9 changes made it 3x harder because many mobs became
untargetable with mouse.  That said, I've always thought Guk was the most
dungeonlike, so it's kind of nice from an immersion perspective.
