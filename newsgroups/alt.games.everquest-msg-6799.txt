LOL! I saw an interview with Frank Zappa and they asked him
about his children's names. Apparently all the neighborhood kids
were calling him "Dweezil the Weasel" so he complained to his
father and had his name changed to Rick. Yup you guessed it
the kids started calling him "Rick the Dick!" so back to Dweezil
it went! Ah the cruelty of 8 year olds is legendary. =)
