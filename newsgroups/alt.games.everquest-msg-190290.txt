Hehe, Yantis dont fraud people. He might break the UELA (and no, i dont 
agreen with him, personally got offered around 300ï¿½ for 100K pp (that i 
made PLAYING, not from buying from Yantis :)) and declined, dont support 
selling stuff from EQ), but the other guy is stealing accounts, and it 
actually surprise me that noone check it out a little more, with the 
info Yantis posted EQ SHOULD be able to ban the guy.
