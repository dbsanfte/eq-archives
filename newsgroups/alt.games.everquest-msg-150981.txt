Bullshit.  for every 2 shamans or druids, they gain almost 1 cleric...
would you say a guild recruiting clerics meant the mob difficulty was
lessened?

Remember, your in a 1st tier guild... by the time second tier guilds get
there, the shit gets nerfed, the encounter gets made more difficult.. sure
you didnt have strats to follow, but more often than not you also had an
easier encounter to deal with.
