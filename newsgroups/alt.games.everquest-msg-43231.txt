Other than my Ghoulbane, the AoF is the only weap I have that procs so I
can't speak for others. The GB does insane damage for a weapon of its level
against unded, but not against anything else.
I was kind of disappointed in the AoF. I worked towards levelling so it woud
proc, got some DEX+ rings so that the chance of it procing would be better,
and then see that it only procs for 6 damage. Oh well, it is a good weapon
though and I have taken down a lot of mobs with it, but I just wish the proc
was higher.
