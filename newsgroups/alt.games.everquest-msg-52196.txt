i was in EK the other day just past the wooden bridge from NK along the path
there were 2 naked human appearing NPC's there both had the exact same name
of "!" with out the quotes. the both answeared my hails with something along
the lines of "we have no time to talk" yes they used the word "we" as if
they we speaking for each other. there were green to 30 and i killed them
both NO loot no items no coin nothing not faction hits.i have screen shots
but this is not a binary group and im not making up a website for them =)
