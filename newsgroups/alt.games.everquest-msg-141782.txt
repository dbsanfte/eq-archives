Just did a google search on my posts.  I dinged 54 on May 18th, I dinged 55
on August 10th.  Took me 12 weeks to make it through 54.  That's out of a
grand total of about 86 weeks playing EQ, or about 1/7th of my EQ play time.
59 is worse?  I wonder what level my enchanter will be by the time I ding
60?
