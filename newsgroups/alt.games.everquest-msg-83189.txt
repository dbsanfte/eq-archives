I'd like to ask for advice as to what *single* mobs are a good way to fast
experience gain for certain levels. To explain, camping the Hermit in SK is
great for mid twenties, not much risk, no bad faction hit. The Cargo
Clockwork in Steamfont is another camp for the thirties, Cynthia the Wizard
is another good camp. I'd like to know if there are any mobs that fit into
this category? These are the only ones I know of ...

Many thanks, as always ...

Stevie.
