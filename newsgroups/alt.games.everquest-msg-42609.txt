It all boils down to the necromancer's grouping abilities. I know a
necromancer in my level range (he's 56 now) who has soloed almost all
the time, with all his characters. I can't stand grouping my druid
with him, since he basically treats me as a pet with heal, sow and
tracking and is incredibly boring, silent company. I can't stand
grouping my shadow knight with his druid, since he still acts as if he
is soloing and won't listen if I try telling him what he should do
(such as damage shielding me and snaring the mob instead of nuking).

I also know someone with a level 50 druid who plays a necromancer
around the level of my shadow knight. Even though he can outdo most of
my spells, we have a blast when we team our dark elves up. In his mid
teens, he's already a far better grouping necromancer than my level 56
friend ever will be, from what I've seen.
