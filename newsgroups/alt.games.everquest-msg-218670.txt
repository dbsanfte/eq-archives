The theatre owner doesn't have to spill the orange crush, hell... he 
doesn't even have to sell orange crush... another patron could walk in 
with it, spill it, and leave... and the theatre is still held legally 
responsible for ensuring that the puddles are labelled immediately and 
cleaned up posthaste.

SoE with EQ could be held similarly accountable. Granted the patron 
never leaves his den in his home or whatever, but the virtual world 
could be argued to be as an environment no different to a theatre 
limited only in that only the patrons mind is exposed to harm...wherein 
SoE has an obligation to prevent harm coming to its customers... even as 
result of the actions other customers.

To wit... Microsoft recently announced its chat rooms would become a 
paid subscription service, ostensibly to make it harder for pedophiles. 
Clearly MS was afraid of being held legally responsible for hosting 
these chats, and the ensuing liability stemming from allowing harm to 
come to its young users... (and the opportunity to make a buck surely 
was not lost on them either)... but EQ is far more a visceral world than 
an MSN chatroom. If you can prove liability in a chatroom then SoEs got 
no wiggle room whatsoever for EQ.
