I agree to a point. Some of the music I love, while some of the music I 
find very annoying.

I love the music which gives the game atmosphere, such as the music 
which plays while entering certain areas (except Aviak village!). 
Crushbone and the town at the bottom of Crystal Caverns are two good 
examples. Some of the music I find annoying and repetitive is the melee 
music and the way the crouching music continues after you stop crouching.

I wish SOE would have rather put more effort into improving the midi 
music so that it is more dynamic with the action of the game, rather 
than simply replacing the same music with digitised versions. Slow music 
when not much is happening, and fast music when the action heats up. A 
great example of this was the old X-Wing and TIE Fighter games from 
Lucasarts.
