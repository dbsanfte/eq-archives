}By *inviting* you to play with them these kids *are* showing manners (in their
}own way).   They are *asking* if you want to join them.  Just say no.
}I've never understood why this is such a big deal.....

I tend to go with the newbie/children theory.  People are newbies to 
higher levels now... I've had to educate quite a few people approaching 
level 20 as to how, for example, /tell, or /con, worked, because they 
hadn't encountered these things before.  You can get pretty high without 
even having clicked that 'invite' button before, and it does look 
inviting.  "Hmm," thinks the newbie, "So I click this button, and it'll 
open up a window so I can send this guy a message asking him if he wants 
to group, right?  Oh, no, that didn't work.  Weird.  Maybe I didn't click 
it hard enough?"

Of course, until fairly recently, I was in the reverse habit of wandering 
up to any caster that conned green to me and was sitting medding, and 
inviting them out of the blue.  The game was to see if I could guess well 
enough at what point they would take the invite, such that the "Noobie's 
mind expands beyond the bounds of space and time" message would appear 
-just- as they joined the group, and before they could say "hi!".  Then 
I'd disband them and run away. :)

Perhaps I set them a bad example, eh? :)  But very few of them ever said 
"WTF?  Why are you inviting me?  That's so rude!"
