7 days yes. In game time? I'm not sure. I thought it was real time.

Not too long ago, I had a corpse with all my stuff in an ldon instance 
get munched when they brought the servers down, and had to get it 
restored from backups by CS (took a couple days, just to get the 
petition answered, and then another couple days for it to actually 
happen). They didn't think to close the instances first and eject the 
corpses... I'm curious if they're ejecting them now, or even popping the 
corpses directly over to the new graveyard zone... or whether they're 
still munching them. Not curious enough to try though :)

More or less. Its primarily to reduce customer service time wasted on 
recovering peoples stuff from rotted corpses, for whatever reason. Oh, 
and a week isn't ungodly amounts of time either =)
