They wouldn't be "disconnecting" your account due to their mistake. They 
would be doing so due to your refusal to pay the agreed upon sum.

Correct.

You're still correct. Well, if you consider the very vocal few to amount 
to an uproar. Most see it for what it is and aren't worried about trying 
to get over.

I call that over-sensitivity. There was on ill-intent or unscrupulous 
activity here in any sense. We owe'd them $29.90, they charged $21.90 to 
our credit cards. Why do we care that it was done in two slightly 
different sized amounts?

What, do you expect them to send you a bill? For $2.00? That's just far 
over-complicating the matter. 

This amounts to little more than a mountain being made from a mole hill.
