As others have noted, pulling from the train might still get
you chain agro, so you're not immune to the rest of the train.
But there's still a big hole here, and I don't see how they
can plug it and still make it impossible to train.

Suppose a level 1 wants to go somewhere that involves getting past
level 20-30 mobs?  Maybe even a mix of live/undead or some that
see invis?  No problem!  Get a friendly level 65 to stroll in with
you and agro everything.  By definition, the collection of mobs
he's carting around is a train, so if you're immune to it, just
saunter on alongside him to wherever you were going.
