LOL.. it turns out that I really needed the 3" finger which I got off the
first fingered skeleton that spawned. Headed to the Chessboard Island to
retrieve one of the three Iksar hands from Master Rinmark. I won't talk
about how ANNOYING it was to try to catch the boat again. I wound up
swimming all the way to the Ogre Island.

All that work and my Shackle of Rock has the same graphic as the Shackle of
Stone.

Bleh!!
