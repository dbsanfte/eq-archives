Most good pullers don't care about the healer's mana level.  Ok whatever.

Not a big one.

Gee, I guess runed totem staff is such an awesome weapon at level 12 then.
With that at level 12, I could come close to a level 12 monk's damage using 
fists.

No you'd have less downtime when you kill faster, duh.

30% of the time?  That's BS unless you haven't maxxed your weapon skills or
fighting red MOBs that the monk would have trouble hitting as well.  With 2 
players sharing the tanking duty you can get twice the natural regen (still 
reasonable at level 12) to work for you.
