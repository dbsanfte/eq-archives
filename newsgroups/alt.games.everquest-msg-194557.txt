you are correct. I tested this and yes, so long as you leave Song of
Sirens running it does re-charm the pet. But, you loose crowd
control/constant chain etc.

I was able to charm, chain,, then restart charm and keep control. So yes
it is posible .


Other stuff is very useful for future kiting.
Will keep in mind for when I get adsl connection.
