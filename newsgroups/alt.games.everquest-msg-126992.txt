Your Gem of nimbleness drops  off of Drolvarg ragers in Dreadlands,  it is
indeed a piece for  a rogue quest for Rozzuts whistler, you need the gem of
nimbleness, a frontier ore off of burnyai miners in mines of nurga,  you
take those 2 items  and 500pp  to a dorf in Butcher Block mts vei for a very
nice no drop piercer 11/22 and some stats

Here is the link to the Quest
