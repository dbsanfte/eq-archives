You have to insert a pause command between each auction to do it that way.
Otherwise, though you will see the full content of your auctions, no one
else will. The server intreprets it as a flood and seems to block everything
but the first line.

I'm sure that someone will correct me if I'm wrong, but you will probably
want it to go something like:

/auction Selling Blah Blah Blah
/pause 20
/auction Selling Blah blah blah

You may want to play with the pause time a bit... I don't know what would be
best to use.
