No regular group.  All pick-up, all the time.  (I'm not sure if I
should laugh or cry.)

Anyhoo, I think there may be something to the level idea, but not by
much.

I haven't done a guk since the first couple weeks of release, so my
0-3 record there may be more indicative of people not having a clue
back then. Due to the layout and vision problems in there, I still
leave it at the hardest.

Tak is only slightly tougher than mmc, but you really need to have a
snarer.  MMC allows yoo to get by without one, but in any of the
others, a runner can usually mean adds or worse.

Ruj is probably on par with Tak.  You get a lot of casters, and it
could be more of a problem, but not by much usually.

Mir is tougher than both those, I've found.  Mostly due to tight
corridors and paper thin walls in some locations.  I love some of the
mobs in here though.  Especially some of the more esoteric
'creations'.

And still, the biggest problems are usually the same everywhere.
Overpulls, people not pounding the cleric mobs to death early, and
stunning them once you see the C heal graphic start.  Not snaring
mobs.  Just basics.

I still love doing them though.  Especially odd combos. =)
