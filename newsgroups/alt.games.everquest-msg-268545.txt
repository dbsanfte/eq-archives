I've started spending some serious time doing tradeskills and I have
some serious doubts about the system.

I think the fact the brokers have virtually no player crafted items
for sale pretty much sums up what my experiences have told me so far.
The only things I seen listed was some 8 slot backpacks that were
around 70 silver .... it'll be two months before I have that kind of
money. Two months work for a backpack ?

I've found the whole process -extremely- tedious and time consuming.

Things that i've found wrong with it:

Getting resources is a pain. You basically run around a zone like a
mad chook hoping to come upon a minable rock/graden/trap and get it
before someone else does.

Why can't there be crafting stations in every town ? Why do I have to
go all the way back to one I joined in order to craft ?

In order to make anything, you have to make about 8 other items using
various other skills. And those 8 other things require you make
another 8 things in order to make them. The problem is that you simply
don't have the holding capacity to hold and create all these various
items in order to make just one item.

Even though the things i'm making are listed as "very easy", you'll
only make a pristine item about 1 in 3. There are some "very easy"
items i'm still yet even able to get to the final stage. 

And it takes so long. forget about clicking "create" and you've got
it, I have to sit here for like 60 seconds, watch the bloody bars go
up and down and click on various icons which don't seem to make any
difference anyway.

I spent an awful amount of time in order to make a backpack, it was
supposed to be "very easy" but I could barely make it, and it was
still a crappy 4 slot pack no better than the bags i had.

They should have taken a good look at SWG's crafting and done it more
like that I reckon.

Cheers,
