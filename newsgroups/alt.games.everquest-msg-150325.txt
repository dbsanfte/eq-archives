You couldn't be more wrong.  Paladins die much better than Rangers
or SKs or any other class.  Once in a while you'll see a Warrior
put on a good death (but not too often, mostly when a Warrior does
a really good death it's because he's solo, so there's nobody there
to appreciate the performance).  Rangers just fall over... one
second they're dancing the cuisinart, the next they're gating home.
SKs just fall over too, only they're not always actually dead.
Monkees pretend to be dead so often that you usually don't even
notice when it happens for real until several minutes later
(stealth death!), not much of a show at all.  Bards, well Bards get
to choose between disappearing in the blink of an eye, or doing the
ol' RangerGate, it's usually not too difficult a choice.  Casters,
hmmm if EQ's graphics had the pointless gore of so many other games
we'd be calling casters screen pizza.  So, in the final analysis,
for a good death you really ought to get a Paladin, tho sometimes
you can manage with a Warrior in a pinch.
