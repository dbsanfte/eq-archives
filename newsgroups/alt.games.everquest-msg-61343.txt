  I'm talking gaming/3D and multimedia applications myself when I say the
benchmarks I've seen indicate the Athlon is the leader.  When I read
hardware reviews I usually skip right past the "office/business" software
(as well as the "synthetic" benchmarks) and go right to gaming and
multimedia tests.
