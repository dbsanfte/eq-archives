For what its worth that is linux out of the box too (except maybe for 
the voice chat, and camera support is a little more spotty)

I agree that XP's GUI-is-practically-kernel is a poor design. And I 
wholeheartedly agree that the installer should let you be a lot more 
selective about what gets put in.

But it doesn't bother me much that the rest of the crap is on the CD.

And I don't think it contributes to the cost *that* much either, seeing 
as solid alternates for all XPs bundled apps can be had for a song (from 
Wordpad, to IM, to the browser, to the media player, to the web server, 
to the mail client... and I do think most people appreciate being able 
to *use* a PC (of any OS) productively out of the box.

I'm far more offended by Norton Internet Security suite in terms of 
bloatware resource pig. Get behind a hardware firewall; have your email 
scanned for viruses before it gets delivered to you and run your 
computer at seemingly twice the speed.

Add a periodic online scan (e.g. housecall.antivirus.com), or use 
f-prot's command line virus scanner www.f-prot.com periodically just to 
be sure, and perform regular backups (something you should do in any case).
