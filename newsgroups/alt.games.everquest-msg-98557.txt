1 cleric ( no  clerics ,  no  raid ,  no  matter what  )
2 enchanter (no  enchanter  for clarity no  clerics  will  show up)
3 shaman (slow is the difference between  success and failure on  most mobs)
4 SK ( best  MA's  can  pull  in  a  pinch  .)
5  monk ( if  you  can't  find an  sk to  pull)
6 warrior
7 wizard
8 rogue
9 everybody  else mages are great CoH  ,  rangers  for  snare and  someone
to  die for good drops ,  palidans  for  rezzing  rangers , druids  for
back  up  healing  shaman , bards  are  everyone's  friend

what  a  good  raid  versus  major mobs  need ,
1 cleric /  group
3 good chanters  for  clarity 3 , speed , mes/  charm or  in  ToV  or
sleepers  bedlam  /  rampage
3 shaman  malo  slow  cripple , +  the  best  buffs in  the game .
1-2  sk if  used  for ma ,  more for pullers . (sk  get  aggro  and  hold
aggro  versus  the average mob  better than  anyone )
5 warriors ,  fattys  prefered (can't  stun  or they  have nat  regen) for
MA  list  versus big  mobs
3 monks  to  split  pull  just  about  any  room
as many  wizzards  and  rogues as  you  can  get  to  actually  damage a
mob.(manaburn  is better  than  backstab  ,  and  the porting  ability  both
into or out  of a zone is a  plus)

anyone  else  you  can  fool  into  filling  spaces . (must  have 1  ranger
for any  sucessful  raid ,  someone needs  to  be sacrificed to  appease the
loot  gods . )
