About to undertake research (though it's a bit early at level 20, my
necro is growing impatient.)

First: How many points is the max skill you can have at any given level?
As I understand it, if I'd started  at level sixteen, I could only have
a max skill of one. However, can I have five per level? So, at level
twenty could I have a max of 21?

Second: How many points can I dump in at the trainers? Is there a limit?
I have sufficient points banked up on my necro to just dump 21 in if I
could.

Last: Where does each spell "trivial" at, if this term applies? Trivial
levels for other skills like tailoring, etc. are readily available, but
I see no mention of it for research at castersrealm. Do they trivial at
the level of the desired spell? Above that? Do they just *not* trivial
and it's always a crap shoot?
TIA
