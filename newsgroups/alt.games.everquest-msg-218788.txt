Havent actually played a druid have you ?

First off the Druid Complete heals are better than the Shaman complete heal.

Shaman:
Kragg's Mending - Level 58 heals a max of 1950 Hp's for 400 mana.

Druid:
Tunares Renewal - Level 58, heals a max of 2925 Hp's for 400 mana.
Karana's Renewal - Level 64 heals a max of  4680 Hp's for 600 mana.

Clearly druids here have the upper hand in complete healing spells, as they
have more to choose from, and they are both more mana efficient (7.3, and,
7.8 health healed per mana for the Druid, as opposed to 4.875 health healed
per mana for the shaman )

As for actual regen spells druids and shamans are even at the high end of
the game. Both get replenishment, and thats the best regen either get.

What shamans do have over Druids however are the HoT spells stoicism,
torpor, and Quiessence.  Stoicism and Torpor are great for healing casters,
or other healers, however for a tank, or damage dealer they are sub-par, due
to the snare, and slow components which can make positioning a mob, and
holding aggro problematic ( although for SK's and Paladins the aggro holding
is mitigated by thier casting abilities). Fortunately for the shaman
Quiessence does not suffer from those drawbacks, and is indeed an excellent
healing spell. Unfortunately however its also a level 65 spell and requires
a Runeword, or purchasing for an obscene price in the Bazaar.

What druids however have that Shamans do not is a larger selection of and
better quick spells that heal large amounts all at once. Shaman get the
spell Tnarg's mending, a level 63 spell that heals 1300 hp, at a cost of 450
mana in 3.75 seconds. At 63 Druids get Natures infusion, a spell that healed
1750 hp at a cost of 500 mana in 3/75 seconds.  ( 2.89 hp/mana for the
Shaman, and 3.5 hp/mana for the druid ) Additionaly however the druid will
get Natures Recovery at level 60, a 978 hp healing spell for 400 mana. Not
the best in terms of efficiency, or speed ( 5.5 seconds casting time ) but
it gives a level 60 Druid healing options that the Shaman does not have.
