Well brother, mine has been going on for a helluva lot longer than since the
last patch. And there is no rhyme or reason to the crashes. No similar
situations. Just BOOM. But I am thinking of trying EQW as suggested. I have
a question tho.. is it detectable by Verant that a person is using EQW?
Because I'm sure they would consider it a horrible offense to actually be
able to run other programs while playing EQ. =)
