I am afraid that you are going to have to give up the Wisdom for
Resistances..it is a very simple reason really..if you have lets say 255
Wisdom and base resists..you will not even survive 30 seconds in a
Nagafen/Vox encounter..plain and simple...30 seconds is pushing it.

Do 100+ unbuffed exist?  You bet your life it does... again the extra wisdom
you lose outweighs dying and having to go through rez effects, then
remedding to full mana, etc...

My resistances range from anywhere to 200-300 fully buffed..and I still take
nasty hits from mobs in ToV, etc..my wisdom drops to around 180ish with
resistance gear on...but high level encounters you are probably going to
have gear with mana bonuses, KEI, some FT items..so the wisdom loss is not
that noticeable..

For the Nagafen/Vox issue as a Druid you are going to be healing a bit more
than you are nuking..and remember to land nukes you must be in melee
range..so with out good resists by the time you make it to the nuke call and
get to melee range you will most likely be dead..if you even made it that
far...

as a monk you are already in melee range..again no resists...no seeing
dragons fall =/

I hope this answes your question friend, and theres alot more factors that I
probably missed as well..

Need some ideas on gear?  check my magelo:
