Yes there IS a noticable difference...
My 1st Mage with 203 Int did great on smithing... until he hit higher end
Banded.

My Cleric with 230 Wis just zipped thru high Banded and into mid-range fine
steel.

Might not be a case of EVERY extra point counting... but atleast every other
point seems to help.

No... "secondary" stats only matter if your Int/Wis truly suck... which is
true for most non-casters (Monk, Warr and Rogue)
Only 2 skills have a "secondary" stat... Smithing has Str, for Warriors...
Fletching has Dex, presumably for Rogues.
