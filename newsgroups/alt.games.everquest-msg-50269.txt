1. Code vendors to pay at least 50% of the current "auction" price of
any item. There is absolutely no reason to sell any item to a vendor
unless there is zero demand for it.

Many players would rather sell for 50% of top dollar than waste time
in auction. This will remove many items from circulation. The trick is
tracking the current "going rate" for an item.
