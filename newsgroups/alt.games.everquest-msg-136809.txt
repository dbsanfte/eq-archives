Ok, I have a question.  With the new UI, I heard that there is a new zone.
Well what im wondering is how are you supposed to download it?  Is it just
for legends customers? I went to where the zone is supposed to be and
someone asked if i saw a "red jewel".  Well I did not.. all i saw was 2
bags, and neither of them did anything.  So do I need to download something?
Please help.. I would like to play in this zone=)
