If anything its gaining, more than ever. 

Part of the problem is that everyone jumped on the MMORPG bandwagon
trying to make the next everquest, while not trying to make a BETTER
mmorpg than everquest. Meanwhile, while they try to make theirs EQ
comes out with like 9 more add ons and various game engine upgrades.

Yes. They'll keep EQ running as long as lots of people still play.
Currently its over 400,000 subscribers still.

As someone new you may want to wait for EQ2, though. Its made by the
same people in a way, so it should contain the best of EQ1 with a lot
of improvements you can only have with a totally new game. Or maybe it
will suck, who can tell?

EQ1 is having some big engine upgrade at some point. Unlike the Luclin
upgrade, which was only character models, this one will be the entire
engine (like the code/graphics, etc that are the entire game world.)
This will either make it run much better while still looking good on
current systems, or it will make it really suck on all but the best
systems (for some reason, lately it seems to be the later on most new
pc games.)
