I discussed this with some friends who play high-level clerics and got
some really useful advice that I didn't see here, so let me add it to
the list:

Chain stun.

Cleric stuns take a long time to cycle, but you get a whole line of
them. Memorize your three best damaging stuns. (Wow. They are good for
something,) your top nuke, your best root, and one or two heals. Cast
your first stun, nuke, cast your second stun, nuke, cast your third
stun, nuke. By this point, your first stun will have cycled and can be
used again. If all of your stuns fail, root and wait.

I used this to great effect when when my group broke, I did the braid
quest several times, and finished off the night one kill away from 29.
Ran over to LOIO, grabbed an icebone, and went to town.
