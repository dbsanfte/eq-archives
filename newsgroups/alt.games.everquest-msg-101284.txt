Hmmm... Too bad this doesn't work for an RPG games in RL either...  You
know..  D&D, with its 10+ books, its multiple modules before and after its
revamping for the 3rd time.  Oh... And don't you have to BUY the new rules
so you can understand what some of the new material means...  I mean...
Sure... you don't all have to buy the book, but people do buy it so they
have their own reference material.  I guess that is just me who sees this
being somewhat a poor reasoning.

Everquest is almost like Magic...  Where each expansion, you will have to
spend money to get into it.  And subscription rate is pretty much you
buying booster packs to get other things to work up your deck.  It is the
same idea too...  It is a game that doesn't get a lot of support from
Wizards of the Coast...  It has mistakes that people exploit...  I left it
cause I got tired of throwing a bunch of money into a game that started out
as fun, then became way too much of an investment to pay.  EQ is fun, has
its problems much like Magic, but it doesn't have me spending hundreds of
dollars to gain more content on a monthly basis, nor am I paying for
Legends, cause I want to play with friends.

So don't let the door hit you on the way out, and as Abu from Simpsons once
said, "I'll See you in Hell, and Thank you, come again."
