 I used public transit for 7 years, namely the bus, that is all we had (
little town of 60 thousand in mid Michigan), and yes, it sucks.  What takes
5 minutes in your own vehicle, okay, 10, minutes, takes up to an hour or
more on the bus.  That has not changed in the eight years since I have used
it, apparently, as I had my son ride a public bus home from school recently
and what is normally a round trip time of 45 minutes in my car was 2.5
hours.

     We have a trolley system in San Diego, one which I do not have any
complaints about, I have used it several times, but it is rather limited,
for example when I go to the Naval Hospital (which I do weekly sometimes
twice--diabetic pregnancy, *don't ask, it's umm, different*) the nearest
stop is miles out of the way and while I don't mind walking, anything over a
mile at this point is not possible for me.  We have two vehicles as my
husband commutes 60 miles round trip daily to work (and that is *tiny*
compared to some here) and I transport my son to and from school daily as
well as attend college, on and on....none of these things are within walking
distance, unfortunately, so yes, I guess I do feel that our vehicles are
necessary simply for matters of time saving.  Not a class thing at all
really, at least for me.

     It was interesting to read your comments regarding the UK and how it is
for some there, I have a friend in Essex who constantly gives me shit about
how I need to take a subway or buy a motorcycle:) Things must be pretty
close together for you there eh?
