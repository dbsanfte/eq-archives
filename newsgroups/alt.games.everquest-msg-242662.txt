Sorry, no.   Enchanters get this spell at level 63 or 64 from a spectral
turn in.  Its nowhere near limited to the "10%" that you say qualify as uber
raiders.  At this point in the game's lifecycle, I'd be willing to bet a
vast  majority have at least one character in the 60's.

And one charmed PoP mob can outdamage an entire party.   Give the mob haste
and it becomes truly obscene.   (If someone is there to snare the mob and
keep it snared, it's safe enough to do. Otherwise it's not recommended.)
