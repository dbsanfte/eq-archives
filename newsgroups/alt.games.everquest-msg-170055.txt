The original 4 warders are extremely weak..  i have no doubts that a lot of
mid-sized guilds could kill them now, least of all Xevs top server.

Well firstly it was an entirely tongue-in-cheek discussion (I doubt jazz
made the post....)
Dick waving with cross-server guilds is kinda pointless.. and as for "better
than many" - do you mean in terms of kills or in terms of attitude/behaviour
(ie not having a mouth like FoH)..?

"Honor me this, honor me that .... who the fuck even cares?! The age of
chivalry or whatever you call it is obviously over. I tread on you, you
tread on me, it's a vicious fuckin cycle and I don't need the whole
honorable wrap from some stinkin Pallies. Go enjoy the fun life, do
something bold and daring, be a rebel, raaar! Have a drink, hit the
bong...celebrate goddammit! " - Harmoniums site.

Anyway looking at their website, they are behind Prexus for starters in
terms of advancement/achievements.. /shrug maybe I missed something?
