If they manage to have enough quests to make for more than one unique 
play experience -at launch- they're doing just fine.

And if they are successful enough to last 7 or 8 expansions I wouldn't 
worry much about having stuff to do at the high end game.

And if they're smarter than EQ, and don't simply obsolete the previous 
expansions with the next one then new players picking up the game at 
that point won't be presented with 20 zones worth playing in, and 200 
hundred they've never seen, and have no reason to see, except as 
tourists.

WoWs ruleset enforces the PnP. EQs ruleset undermines the PnP its 
ruleset. (Assuming WoW uses the same PnP.)

That makes it an improvement over EQ, even though its still far from 
ideal.

Heh... this -never- happens in EQ right :)

In EQ the *best* way to do most quests is to progress to the point where 
the quest is soloable and probably green so you can pop the rare spawns 
in a reasonable amount of time.

There are few good quests in EQ that people do at a level appropriate if 
the option to level past them and return to them is possible.

God forbid you are level appropriate fighting your way into the room 
where the named is standing... as the 65th necro levitates past, engages 
the named, and leaves... no... that never happens in EQ :p

/shrug If they make a first person MMORPG then its an attempt to copy 
EQ... true perhaps but meaningless. Some of the longer lived mmrpgs can 
stand on their own two feet now imo.
