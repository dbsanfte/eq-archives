I've played off and on for about that long and haven't settled on a main 
either.  I suppose that currently it's Vich, since at 12 he's the highest 
level character I have right now.

My highest level character ever was a 23 Iksar monk, but she was deleted way 
back when.

Vich, 12 Iksar Monk, Firiona Vie
Crocuta, 5 Vah Shir Berserker, Morden Rasp
Tanra, 4 Vah Shir Rogue, Morden Rasp
Hazma, 4 Iksar Shaman, Drinal
