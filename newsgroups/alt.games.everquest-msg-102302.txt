The main problem I have with trolls is that when some of the dummies who
respond to them actually include all the original stupidity.  Come ON!! My
newsserver filtered them out already, I don't wanna see idiocy compounded by
flamers.  And for God's sake, DO NOT include any of the website addresses
they have in the trollish postings. Don't want to help them get more traffic
to thier site.
