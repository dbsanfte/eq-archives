/shrug 

If IGE is dealing outside of a station exchange enabled server then they 
can claim SOE isn't even in the same market.

Unless of course SOE station enables all their servers... but I won't be 
around for that eventuality.

And even if SOE does station enable all servers and IGE competes 
directly with them by brokering for less I'm still unconvinced that SOE 
is automatically granted a monopoly on the brokerage business simply as 
a result of the EULA.

You may be right, but I'm highly skeptical.

Then its not a *philisophical* objection. Its just a desire to make 
money instead of someone else. Either your against the practice on 
principle or you aren't. SOE isn't.

Consider slavery. Either you are philisophically against slavery, 
beleiving no human should own another, for the good of mankind, or you 
aren't. Its not a philisophical objection if it matters whether or not 
you are the slave. A slave who objects to being a slave and wishes he 
was the master *doesn't* have a philisophical objection to slavery. He 
just doesn't like his particular lot in life. There's no such thing as 
being "philisophically opposed to being a slave, but philisophically ok 
with being the master." Its just hypocrisy.



What your describing would be like claiming
