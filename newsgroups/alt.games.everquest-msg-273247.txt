Here's how I'd do it if I were the guy in charge of a new MMORPG.

1. Servers start out with a soft limit on the number of accounts that can
create characters on them.  When a server is at or over the soft limit, you
need in invitation from someone already there in order to start on that
server.

The soft limit would be set fairly low at launch, and would be increased
over time.  The idea is to get people to spread out, but if they do have
friends that start ahead of them, they can get onto the servers their
friends are on if their friends invite them.

2. I'd group the namespaces of several servers.  Say we start with 40
servers.  I'd have those grouped, maybe 8 groups consisting of 5 servers
each.  You can't use a name that is already used on a server in your group.
Other than that, the servers in a group are independent.  The idea here is
that if we got a serious overpopulation problem on a server, we could offer
free transfers to another server in the group, without having to worry about
name conflicts.

As new servers are added, they would be added to the groups that are most
crowded, and if a group ends up with more than, oh, 7 servers, that group
would be split into two groups.  (I wouldn't want these namespace groups to
be too large because they will make it harder for people to find a good name
that isn't already taken...I hate it in crowded MMORPGs when I spend 30
minutes every time I create a character trying to find a good available
name!).
