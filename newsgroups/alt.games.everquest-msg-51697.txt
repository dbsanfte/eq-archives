If you want to avoid the crowds in the Commons, the long distances between
spawns that you can find in some parts of the Karanas, or the long distance
trek to the Stonebrunt Mts..... another place to consider hunting cats is
North Ro.  Depending on the character's level, I've found the cats of NRo to
be much less of a pain in the arse than the lions of the Karanas, and the
pelt drops are ok.

The skinning knife method is also a possibility, especially when dealing
with HQ wolf and cat pelts.  Just know that every once in a while, you'll
mess up, and turn that HQ pelt into a ruined one.
