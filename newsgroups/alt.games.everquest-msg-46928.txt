Uhhh, no.
They didn't use CoH to clear aggro.  They used two different
"exploit":

1.  They used Rez effect to block the AoE of the fourth warder.
2.  They were accused of using pathing points to keep their casters
from the AoE.

From the list of people who were banned, it included just one mage.
No way in hell that one mage could have chain casted CoH to manage
aggro.
