I was in Lavastorm yesterday with my young mage looking for a Fire Drake.
After much searching all over the zone, I finally found and killed 1.  Only
1,  I never saw another, thankfully it dropped what I needed.

After the patch today, I logged in for a quick minute and ran to Najena.
Lavastorm was crawling with mobs, so hopefully yes they did fix other zones.
Haven't checked EF, and I suppose that will be the real test of the no mob
fix.
