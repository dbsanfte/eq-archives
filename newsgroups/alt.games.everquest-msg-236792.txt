Well, I solved the problem.  I had never actually put the aug into an item
(I had on another character, just not this one)

I kept looking at it in inventory to see the stats.  The did not show up
until I combined the aug into an item (FYI the +Wis charm for LDoN only) and
lo and behold the stats popped up.  So, they do work in all zones, even if
you put the aug into an LDoN only item.  Another puzzle solved!!

Thank you all for helping me solve this puzzle.
