I'm a Half Elf Bard - lvl 20 and getting bored.....
Do Bards get more exciting (was a great class for the first 15 or so lvl's)
Please advise.
Started out in Greater Faydark as a newbie,
Progressed to crushbone.  Was fun when enough people to get a group together
to camp the throne room were there.
Now I am resorting to trying to find a group in the undead section through
from Dagnor's cauldron, but the zone's always pretty damn empty....
When I'm bored and no-one's about I camp the aqua goblin camps in Kaladim
for PP loot.....great $$ but are all green.
Any other good zones that give XP about that may be more populous?
I've only got the PoP expansion....

Interesting note:

I play on the Drinal server and judging by the "Monual's Longest Fight Ever"
post previous, there a a hell of a lot of players online on this server,
just not my lvl or zone area.

I'm lucky to find over 10 people in the zones mentioned above (PoK averages
30-60 ppl when I zone into there....)

Ta,
T.
