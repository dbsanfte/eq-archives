Still 50.  They kind of borrowed some ideas from EQ, though, and there are
things called Master Levels.  Certain hard mobs give Master Level XP, and
you can get abilities as you get more ML XP, I believe.  Trials of Atlantis
is kind of Planes of Power-like in that there is a progression through
it--you have to do certain content before being able to get others, but it
is more puzzle/quest oriented than defeat uber-mob oriented.  They've also
got "artificts", which are kind of like EQ charms, in that their power
changes as you have them.

Another thing they borrowed from EQ is making Necromancers ridiculously
overpowered in PvE.  At level 48, my ideal mobs to solo are level 49 and 50.
However, I can just as easily take mobs up to 55 or so--they are merely not
ideal because there is a cap on how much XP you can get per kill, and that
is hit by level 50 mobs, so 51+ mobs are harder for no benefit.  I pull with
three or four casts of a spell that is like a lifetap, except that instead
of giving me life for the life it drains from the mob, it gives me power
(mana in EQ terms), so when the mob arrives, I'm at full power.  There is
then a spell I can cast that gives me 6 seconds where I can't be interrupted
by melee, and so I can do a couple more power taps or I can do lifetaps, if
I'm low on life (my powertap does more damage at this level).  Finally, I
have an essentially instant cast lifetap that I can use during combat to
finish the mob, and get me up to full.  Result: mob dead in usually under 30
seconds, and I'm at near full health and power.  If I run out of 49+ mobs, I
can mow through lower levels, killing them with the powertaps before they
even get to me, so I finish fights at full health/power, and am limited only
by wrist pain from mashing the powertap button so much.  Oh, and Necros have
virtually no equipment needs--and what they do need they can get from the
epic quests, so I'm rolling in cash, even after buying a house with a vault
and various teleport merchants.
