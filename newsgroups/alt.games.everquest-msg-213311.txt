Yup. According to the walkthrough of the ranger epic I have, if the normal
VS is up he must be killed. VSR will spawn 12 and 24 hours after that giving
us two chances to get him ( I don't know if the hours are game hours or real
hours). We don't have to kill VSR, just give him a summoned firefly globe,
then spirit of VS spawns. Don't have to kill the spirit either, just give
him the lev 49 cleric resurrection spell then the easy VS spawns. We kill
him and loot the pulsing green stones, which will be his only loot. Job done
!
