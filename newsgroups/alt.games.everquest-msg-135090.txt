    So what do they cast instead of Moonfire? Ours that have it use it as
their primary nuke.

    Oh, M, M, M. Cann gives you mana. Torpor gives you back the health Cann
takes, at much less mana. Net result: infinite mana. A shaman with Torpor
never needs to sit to med again. Why are clerics so powerful with
Manastones? Because we can efficiently heal back the damage from the stone.
Same deal with shamans.

    That's what Cann 5 is all about. I have our guild's best shaman spoiled
rotten - he'll Cann 5, I'll drop CH on him before he can announce Torpor.
It's cleric Infuse!
