Hi,

This is an off topic post, but my Mother just got a new computer and we
have a question about it.

Her new system is a 1.6GHz Dell Dimension 4300 Pentium 4.

After her system has been running for awhile it begins making a VERY loud
buzzing/humming sound.  This noise can be heard in addition to the "normal"
sounds of her computer's fan... etc.

The sound seems to get louder as the system runs longer.

It is like a VERY noticeable constant humming sound, easily heard over and
above the normal computer type sounds.  It sounds similar to what you might
hear if you placed your ear directly up against a power supply.

Is this type of loud humming sound normal for a fast computer like her's?

When she first turns the system on, you can hear the normal background sounds
of a computer system running.  But the really loud hum does not start until
after her computer has been running for 15 or 20 minutes or more.

Then the hum is really noticeable even above the other system sounds.

We called Dell tech support, and asked them about this.  They had us open up
her case and listen.  First they said it could be a problem with her cooling
fan.  But then they said it was probably just the normal sound of her fast
processor running.

So we are both wondering, what do other people's systems with similar speed
processors sound like?  Do your systems make a LOUD humming sound?

Is this normal?  Should she be worried?

I have never heard a computer make such a loud constant humming sound before.

But then I have never heard a 1.6GHz computer running, so I have nothing to
compare it to.  Maybe it is normal.

Any comments?

Many Thanks,

 - Mike Dorr
