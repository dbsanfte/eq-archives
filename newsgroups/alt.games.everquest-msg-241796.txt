Well, we can, though I have actually traded in game plat for real life 
goods...with a close friend. Not sure tht really qualifies though I do 
consider it me buying plat...just instead of selling a robe I crafted in 
game, I sold an elizabethan gonelle that I made in real life. I can see 
a privately arranged deal as more 'palatable' to the general good that 
it being done commercially whether through Yantis or Ebay. and I did one 
time tell a very good friend that if he ever left EQ, I wanted him to 
sell me his accounts because I could not stand thinking that the mind 
and heart behind a character was no longer him. Sappy, I know, because I 
probably wouldn't actually play the characters in groups or raids 
because they are not the classes I know best and I would not trust my 
play to be up to standards.
