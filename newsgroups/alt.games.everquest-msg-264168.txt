Oh hell yeah. 70% of the mail we deliver is spam. Its only that low 
because about a 5th of our customers have our spam filter on their 
account, and they get 98% of their mail tossed away. (most of them are 
the most egregious spam recips as well). We have more servers dedicated 
to recieving mail than: Web service, ecommerce, internal customer accts, 
etc, dns, news, intrusion detection, system monitoring, user validation, 
and mail storage combined.
