It happens to my dwarf cleric, and not only am I wearing plate,
but you will never, ever, find a dwarf "spirit of wolf" caster.  On
the other hand once I hit 49 I got "Shield of Words," and since
then have embarked on a bone headed campaign of assenting and
then AC buffing the hapless fools who keep asking me for SOW...
the mana cost is rediculous but there's a personal level of satisfaction
I just can't put into words.
