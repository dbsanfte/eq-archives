Some things that have been suggested in the past when this sort of thing was
discussed:

1. Mob database organized by zone, so you can check level range, HP, loot,
faction for mobs.

2. Tradeskill recipie database.

3. Quest item database.

4. Spell timers to keep track of when buffs will expire on groupmates.

5. Spell info database.  (Yes, I occasionally forget what my spells do!
Say, I'm passing through Blackburrow, and decide to do some AoE nuking for
faction.  I never can remember which spell is which among my random lower
AoE spells).

6. Locations of important items, by zone (spawn points of important mobs,
exits, major vendors, etc).

7. Maps?

8. ShowEQ. :-)
