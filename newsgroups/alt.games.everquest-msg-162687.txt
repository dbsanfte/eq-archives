That's an interesting idea, I think I might like it.  Actually, tho
I have not taken the time to test it, it <seems> as if having auto-
attack on increases food consumption.  I use stat food and drink on
my characters and it <seems> as if my force-feeding results in actual
consumption more frequently when I'm melee'ing a lot than otherwise.
Also, I have definitely seen that being overweight increases food
(but not drink, or at any rate much less for drink) consumption on
my bazaar trader who has been "rewarded" for his financial success by
being kept supplied with food and drink (he is always way overweight).

Strictly speaking, that would only be true if "endgame Rangers" were
not merely primarily archers, but exclusively archers.  And I would
say that the extreme to which "endgame Rangers" emphasize archery
over melee these days is a product of Endless Quiver, it's there so
of course they use it.

I'm retiring from this argument, we've both had our say (at least I've
had mine, you might have more to say on the subject).  Endless Quiver
is there, and it seems extremely unlikely that it will be changed
anytime soon.  Certainly you and I arguing about it seems unlikely to
have any particular bearing on that.
