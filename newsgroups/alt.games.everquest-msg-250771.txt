Heh, and I forgot the Wizard Familiars, Lesser version or higher. :)

I also noticed there's apparently 4 kinds of See Invis effects listed in 
lucy, 

See Invis(1) (Most kinds)
See Invis(2) (Acumen)
See Invis(3) (SoE/FoE)
See Invis(4) (Familiars)

Has anyone ever come across something that could be seen with one form of 
see invis but not another?
