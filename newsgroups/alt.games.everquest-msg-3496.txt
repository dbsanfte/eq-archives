Been asking for months what this is for, as it wasnt listed in either
eqmaps or allakazams.   It's part of the Kromrif Battle leggings quest
in Great divide, which return a nice set of +wis pants.  Helped a
druidess finish the quest last night when she mentioned it.

One dowm two to go.

Still need info on what
-Shackle Key from Warden Bruke
-Rygor scalps
are for.
