I'm only 52, so I'll concede that my experience with 55+ dungeons is
limited.

Of course, being that I'm the type of guy that won't let his lack of
knowledge keep him from talking on a subject :-), my guildies who are
living in the high 50's seem to do fine without somebody for evac in
places like SG, which is a pretty ugly dungeon from what I've seen.
Usually they just learn when to make the cleric camp out.

Snare, in a exp grind group is HUGE.  Enormous.  And druids do have
the best snare spell, until 54(?) when rangers get ensnare.
Shadowknights and Necros can snare pretty well, push comes to shove
though.  Rangers, Shadowknights, and Necros also bring an assload more
damage to a group.

Healing any kind of a real tank is a friggin joke.  Was in Sirens the
other night with my guild killing in the Siren City and the cleric was
low on mana so I stepped in for a bit while she medded up some.  I was
chain healing my sorry ass heal spell and I was just barely keeping
ahead of the damage the MA was taking.  We pulled a named siren (which
was admittedly a mistake, she was level 61, and hit like CRAZY) and
there was no way I was keeping that Pally alive.  Even after the mob
had been slowed.

Our buffs are ok, great if you're going up against something that
casts cold/fire spells, but if you have a sufficiently high level
cleric, don't bother with HP/AC buffs.

DS is nice.  Probably a druids best damage spell in a grind group.
But mages DS as well (better Before 50, IIRC) and bring more damage to
a group for all their alleged weakness.

Lemme say this real quick.  I don't dislike druids.  My main is a
druid and I think he's the coolest thing since sliced bread, but we're
just not really the "best" group for anything.  That's almost the
point of the class.  We're the Jack of All Trades and Master of None.
A druid can fill most caster slots in a group, and the whole Swiss
Army Knife thing tends to work in our advantage over the long haul
because of a nice long grind, you'll find yourself filling in here and
there to take up the slack at some point.  It's just Mages complaining
that they aren't powerful enough in the end game just kinda rankles me
a bit because it seems to me that for sheer damage output, a mage with
a pet makes a druid look like a kid with a BB gun.

I piled on my Swarm DoT and my wussy Immolate DoT in Kael once and
found my self appearing at the feet of a few giants.  Granted, druid
fire DoT's have a debuff which seems to generate more aggro, but
Immolate does less than 200 points of damage.  They didn't hurt me
much though, and it allowed me to taunt our MA, so I was alright with
it though.  :-)
