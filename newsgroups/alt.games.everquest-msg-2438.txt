>What did you do this weekend and  major accomplishments?

Hmm... As I was just starting to play my shadow knight on Sat. night,
a lvl 40 monk friend logged in, in Frontier Mountains, on a CR to
Overthere and complaining about losing lvl 41 again. Since my druid is
in OT, I log her in so we can team up and see what we can do about him
getting 41 back. During the couple hours we spent there, he came
within 10 kills of 41, and I made it through half of 29 (welcome to
hell!) before succumbing to the need for sleep.
Sunday; spend some more time playing my SK (I'd gotten killed at lvl 2
the night before and experienced the poofing of all the foraged food
I'd given her). When I logged in outside Neriak gates, one of my
server's 'good' guilds were assembling there. I asked what they were
doing and was told they were raiding Neriak to kill inkies and asked
if I wanted to come :) (I guess my DE druid disguise works) I had
business to do on the inside and managed to keep just ahead of the
raid while buying food, banking and getting myself a dark shield of
ebon and some quest exp. The highest PC native in the city at the time
was a lvl 21 who kept shouting that we should rally against the
invaders, I limited myself to comments on what Innoruuk would do to
them. Switch back to my main to try to powerlvl another friend's gnome
rogue through 13, which is kinda tricky when he keeps going linkdead
and getting killed by sand giants when he returns. After 2 deaths and
3 link deaths, we see the signs and quit.
Last night: attempt II on powerlvling, he is still going ld and dies
twice from meleeing stuff without letting me know or pulling back to
me *sigh* but we get him through 13 in the end, and I get my spec:
alteration secured by using minor healing on him after fights :) I
also got to see a highlvl wood elf druid with her epic and with the
elder spiritist breastplate, sleeves, bracer and gauntlets. Niiice :)
Tonight my friend is going to powerlvl me, he wants to do it with
spectres but I am thinking I have to suggest something that won't kill
me and endanger the zone when he goes link dead...  (I am going to
have to ask if his rogue has better grouping skills than his necro...
I think he is still a bit too stuck in his soloing habits)
