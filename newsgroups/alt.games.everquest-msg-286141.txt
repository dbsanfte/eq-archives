Partly to kick up some more activity, partly just to slate my own
curiosity, what servers are people here primarily playing on these
days?

I'm still lounging about Luclin, working on making lvl 59 so I can get
my SK pony.

And somewhat related, where is the new PC hangout? I'm lucky to see 60
~ 70 PC's in PoK during peak hours, most of them just passing through
or looking for increasingly scarce buffs. Not that getting a group
once in a current hot zone is particularly difficult - for that
matter, soloing in the 55-60 hot zone is laughably easy - but I am
wondering where everyone is.
