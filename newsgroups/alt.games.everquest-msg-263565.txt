As I mentioned elsewhere, there are several reasons they may have done 
this. It is not an indication, in and of itself, of broken design.

Refer to response to point #1. However, I'm sure there was some level of 
development still being done. More on that in a moment.

This is pretty common, and again, it's not an indication of bad practices 
either, per se. Let's not forget that they are still in beta. They have 
time (though it is certainly running short), and we have no more reason 
to believe that the development remaining to be done on the high end is a 
lot than a little.

How about the possibility that is was simply a bug? I'm starting to get 
the heebie jeebies here. You must be speaking from the grave, because the 
only place I have ever heard that application development works as you 
(and generally most textbooks on the topic) describe to the letter of the 
project plan is in heaven. You *have* to expect a few bugs or just plain 
unforeseen points of issue, otherwise the project manager's job would be 
done after Phase II.

To that I say, "Well, duh."

You are like Chicken Little on steroids, bud. O_o

To hear you tell it, 20-hour days should never be necessary. If you wind 
up against the wall that badly, there must have been some mistakes made 
in planning. Perhaps you should go back to Phase I and correct them. :P

FYI, I am also an applications developer, though you've got a few years 
on me.
