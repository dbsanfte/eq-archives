People talk about sheep because it makes them feel superior.

There is one thing above all else you need in EQ.  Better than that
l33t armor or phat weapons.  Better than tons of AA points or levels.

Friends.

The reason people go to the "sheep" zones is that they need to find
pickup groups.  They haven't yet met enough people that they feel
comfortable saying to, "Hey, what are you up to?" or they haven't
found a guild with enough people their level to provide partners.

Keep doing what you're doing, you're doing great.

Be on the lookout for friends, though :)
