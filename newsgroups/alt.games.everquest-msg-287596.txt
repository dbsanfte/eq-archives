Anyone remember the CBS news story about EverQuest a few(!) years ago? I
downloaded it back when it was new.  Was pretty interesting, had
interviews with multi-boxers, people who went to the Fan Faires and of
course, an interview with Shawn Wolley's mother.

Anyone know where I can download it again?

(It was called CBS.wmv for me)
