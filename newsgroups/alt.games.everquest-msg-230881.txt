What's everyone's opinion about the short and mid-term future for
Everquest?  I'm considering starting out in the game, having played
AD&D in college over 20 years ago, but I know Everquest has been
around a few years and maybe it's losing players to newer online
games.  I used to play Air Warrior II & III online and they are no
longer available.  Will there be Everquest adventures online three
years from now?
