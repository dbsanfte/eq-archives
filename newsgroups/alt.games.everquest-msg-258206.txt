Well, SOE themselves have made the claim about 50% of the quests
in the game being unsolved.  Maybe there's a reason for it. :-)

I haven't done a lot of questing, but I've certainly run into a
number of unsolved and/or apparently broken quests.  E.g., there's

	http://www.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=76

where I spent a lot of time in the likely zones trying to find the
required "fern flowers" (with my wife rolling her eyes at the very
concept, since ferns by definition have no flowers!), and eventually
concluded that the Allakhazam forum was probably right: the intended
item is probably the "maneater bud", and the quest is broken because
the buds are "small" but the quest container hold only "tiny" items.

Of course, I could be wrong, and some other item is supposed to go
in the container.  But nobody's ever found such an item.  And the
real problem is that there are enough bugs of this sort that it's
hard to get enthused about trying to solve the quest, because it
seems more likely that the quest is broken and can never be solved.

On the flip side, a while ago I read about an NPC in Shadow Haven
who says she'll tell you a secret if you buy her her favorite drink:

	http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=9807

When I first read about it, I hunted about and found that people had
tried giving her every drink they could find or knew how to brew, and
had even managed to get a hint from the developer that it required a
new recipe.  (The name was another hint; it's an anagram of "new ale".)
I'm a GM brewer, but I had no idea how one might proceed with the
quest.  Well, it seems that in the intervening months people have
somehow stumbled across the required recipe.  I can't find the thread
on EQTC that's referred to in the above page, so I still have no idea
how anyone solved the quest.
