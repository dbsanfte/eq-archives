    Transfer plat to Legends using the character transfer feature (move two
characters to Legends, one from Xev with the plat, one from destination
server), give plat to destination character from Xev character, then move
the destination character back to his home server.

    Characters that wait one month on Legends aren't generally denied a move
back to home server based on what items they have, as long as they don't
have anything that the destination server doesn't have (like Manastones).
