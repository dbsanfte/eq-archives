    You had better, because twinks create the exact same sort of jealousy
that casters with KEI create in melees. You can't fix KEI because it makes
an "imbalanced" game, and ignore the nigh-invulnerable melees in Fungis
running around. They may be the extreme edge of the problem, but it's still
a problem.

    Agreed!

    I've never suggested they could, so it's a moot point.

    Yes, I do. Go to a place with spiders, when spiders are green to you.
Bring a small sewing kit. Kill Many Spiders. At the MINIMUM price in the
Quellious bazaar, each spider silk that drops is worth 5 pp. Spiders can
drop two silks, and some types of spiders can drop up to four. They are the
modern Hill Giant, except they take almost no time to kill and have minimal
risk attached. If you're in a zone like East Karana killing spiders, be sure
to bring along a skinning knife and kill the cats when they get too
plentiful. Leather Padding sells for 40 to 50 pp each, after all!

    Nor am I the last, as I said no such thing. It is not justified. But
your reasoning for nerfing it - "it makes casters into gods, poor melees" -
is flawed. This is what I'm trying to pound home. It doesn't matter that a
melee cannot solo like a caster with KEI. All that matters is if a caster
with KEI can solo faster than SOE intends a character at that level to solo
with any combination of gear and buffs. And while they're at it, they should
take a good look at the melee stuff available and make adjustments there if
necessary, because players can give gear to melees that makes them solo
much, much faster than a KEI-equipped caster.

    Twinking in general does the exact same thing. Characters that would
otherwise group do not do so because there's no reason for them to do so, as
all they value is XP. So analyse all forms of twinking, not just the buffs.

    Well, at least we agree on something. ;-)

    You could always throw out one last "poopiehead", if you liked. ;-)
