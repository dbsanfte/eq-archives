a) New Line announced the SE DVD before the release of the current DVD
(see pretty much any DVD review you can find on LOTR). More than other
studios do.

b) They are offering $5 off the new one for those who bought the
current one. Again, more than other studios have done.

Check out http://www.currentfilm.com/dvdindex.html for DVD reviews,
and an indication of what the differences will be. Considering how
upset you seemed to get, I'm suprised you didn't do a little
investigation before spending $20.
