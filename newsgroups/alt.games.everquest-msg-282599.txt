Not at all. I solo my enchanter most of the time, and soloed my main, a
52 SK, up to 25 or so. And even then, most of my 25+ career has only
been duoing with the wife. While I understand others deisre to do so, I
dislike power-leveling even for new characters going through the grind.

My wife dislikes grouping, and all her characters spent most of their
careers soloing.

We've also experienced the rude remarks and pesterings of those who
think we're morons for not joining their power-levelling group to get
to 70 in a day or two, or somehow take it as a personal affront to not
take their offer of joining their raid guild. I'm actually quite
enjoying Mistmoor right now. Even though it's well below me, no body is
ever there on my server. I'll miss camping the Dark Ass't Librarian in
seclusion.
