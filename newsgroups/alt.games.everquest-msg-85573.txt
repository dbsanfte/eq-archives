The portals are in Tox, NK, GFay, GD and DL.  You go to the Nexus Scion at
the portal and say "I wish to journey to luclin" and the scion will give you
a shard.  If you have this shard on your person when the portal activates
(every 15 min) and you are standing within the spires, you will be
teleported to the Nexus on Luclin.  From the Nexus you can go to any of the
spires on Norrath mentioned above.  You do not need a shard for the return
trip...just stand on the appropriate pad.
