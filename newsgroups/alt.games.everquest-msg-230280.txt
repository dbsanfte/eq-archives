Such is the problem with Collects, particularly low unit collects (< 25 or
so). There's a tremendous amount of mythology surrounding this issue, with
opinions ranging from this being a bug that's never been fixed, to it being
a bug that was fixed and then later broken again, to it not being a problem
at all. I'm not sure if it's a bug, but it sure seems to me a much chancier
proposition than, say, Slaughters. I don't think I'd ever choose a Collect
where it was critical to win the adventure.

Yeah, when I first started playing EQ again I was introduced to LDoN and
commented that it was the best thing that ever happened to EQ. That rather
short-sighted comment was more a reflection of just how utterly different
this expansion was from what I remembered EQ to be. And yeah, there was the
SWG donkey ball suckage, too.

I wavered for a while, keeping one of my 3 SWG accounts active and paying
maintenance on all my properties for about 90 days, popping in from time to
time to see my old buddies and check on their FS progress (one of them just
got their silent Holocron). But on my last visit I turned over all of my
properties, my vast resource empire and my tens of millions of credits to my
old guild, cancelled my last account and uninstalled the software. Fini.
*MAYBE* someday again in a year or two if they add enough interesting things
to do and fix some of the billions of problems that still exist.

Welcome back!
