I did a search for beta games and became a tester on one or 2 games.
Keeps me happy and when i get irratated at dying for the 4x time in 3
hours I can put EQ away and relax elsewhere.

It is a game and should be viewed as such.
I enjoy/love/hate my EQ addiction but breathing and doing real world
stuff should always come first.

Call your Mom, Love your SO, play with your kids, play in the brown
crispy leaves.

NAMASTEï¿½:
        I honor the place in you where the entire universe resides. I
honor the place in you of love, of truth, of peace. I honor the place
within you - where if you are in that place in you and I am in that
place in me, there is only one of us.
