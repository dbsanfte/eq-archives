The problem with tradeskills in EQ is that you can't make anything
worth anything at all until you have mastered your trade...and that
can take a looooong time to do.  I think this may be the result of the
evolution of the game.  As new expansions were brought to the game,
bringing new equipment and higher levels, that stuff you used to be
able to make at level 150 or 200 became absolutely worthless.  Who
wants a full set of banded armor?  Whoopie shit!  This used to be
semi-useful at one time.  So you let people level up to 250 and give
them new recipes.  But the problem is that now the only way to get to
250 is to make piles and piles of useless junk, spending hours and
hours and hours and hours doing it.

It isn't fun.

Sure, finally accomplishing your goals is a relief and it can give
people a purpose...a reason to keep p(l)aying.  But at some point you
ask yourself if this is actually fun.  Do you really enjoy doing this
or are you just torturing yourself so that you can someday be a
grandmaster?

As a side note, I have tinkered around with SWG and while I have been
disappointed with some aspects of the game (for one, there is no
customer service.  When I say none, I mean none), I have found the
crafting system to be far superior to EQ's.
