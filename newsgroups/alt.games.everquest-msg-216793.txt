There are various speculations as to it's origin.  The ones I am aware of 
are

Nine yards of amunition in some fighter aircraft in WWII
Nine cubic yards of bomb bay in a B-52
Nine cubic yards of concrete in a truck
Nine yards of fabric used to fashion a kilt

I had not heard the coal reference before.
