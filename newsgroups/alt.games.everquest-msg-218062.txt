    I'm beginning to doubt the guy even has a rogue. I can't see someone who
played the class being this out of it.

    It will take longer. When you do an adventure that fast, when you come

    It's too bad some of the people at the high-end saw it as a threat to
their Magelo supremacy. I feel the current augment nerf is a direct response
to that.
