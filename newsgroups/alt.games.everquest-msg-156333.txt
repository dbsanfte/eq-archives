Then you're a moron. The only constant in this game, just like in real life,
is change.

Play what you want to play because the journey itself is interesting and
fun, not because of some uber shiney toy you may or may not receive. And
when it starts to stop being so interesting, go play something else that
does. And if the game itself gets too frustrating and not as interesting,
well, there's other games.

I don't care how long it takes to get to 60, or that mythic declaration of
uberness... it's the journey along the way that holds value for me.
