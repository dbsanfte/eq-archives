Step one: Get some charisma gear.
Step two: Head home to EVERFROST.

1. Everfrost mammoth, if you can find them, are easy at your level
even without a healer.  They drop tusks that sell for just over 10
plat each in Halas, so they are often hunted.  There's a merchant in
the zone but his prices aren't as good as in Halas.  
2. Spiders are the place holders for mammoth, so you may get some
silks killing the spiders to spawn mammoths; silks sell well in the
bazaar on most servers.  
3. In that zone also is Martar Icebear; he drops a Cloak of the
Icebear with +20 cold resistance.  When a Vox raid is forming is an
excellent time to sell one, or to wear it and join the fun.  Check the
merchant price before selling to players though because I can't
remember what the npc's pay, but they paid decently. No faction hit
for killing Martar and the cloak is not lore.
4. With a healer you can take on the Ice Giants outside Permafrost.
They drop lots of coin, various gems, and fine steel weapons.
Depending on your gear, you may be able to take these solo but you'd
better have LOTS of bandages; giants hit hard.
5. Rarely, you will see Karg Icebear.  He gives a quest for a werewolf
skin cloak and despawns whenever someone does the quest.  If you kill
him, he sometimes drops a two-handed sword. I'm not sure of the
faction hits on killing Karg.  I think the sword is lore but I'm not
sure about that.
