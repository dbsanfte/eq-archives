First, you should always get your fair shair of the loot.  Though you won't
in CB unless you loot for yourself.  That means, /assisting the main tank
while you're medding so that you can see the health bar of the orc.  Once it
gets close to zero, get up, get close, and prepare to dive for the body once
it hits the floor.  I've rarely been in a group in CB where the leader or
anyone else (but me) has made sure and distribute to the casters (my warrior
always did this with the healers--who kept him alive).

Second, my druid was (and still largely is at 30) in leather through 20-24.
I also solo'd a lot because I play at off times when it's sometimes hard to
group, or can only play an hour at a time.  But sometime early on I got an
Iceclaw War Paw-- 9/25 1hs that's far superior to most 1hb that you can get
at your level.  I think I got it for about 100p, but it was a steal at that
price.  Now you can get a centi warhammer 15/32 1hb, which is better than
the claw (at least once your damage caps start getting removed).  I picked
up one of these for 150p, which again was a steal (IMHO).

Third, at 11 you might want to try the 4 bandit sisters in LFay.  There's a
post on http://eq.castersrealm.com/ in the druids strategy section about
them that's decent to read.  Just camo yourself on your way there.  LFay can
be dangerous, but the xp with the sisters is fabulous.

I don't know of any drops in Felwithe or CB (other than the screaming mace
quest--not worth it if you can get the warhammer or claw), but you can check
http://www.allakhazam.com/ and it will tell you.

Good luck.  Druids rock!
