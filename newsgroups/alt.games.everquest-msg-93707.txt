Oh, there's no problem with including the original text - in fact,
it's highly recommended. The trick is to only include the portion of
it needed to maintain the continuity of the thread.

For example, if we were having a debate full of long messages, I
wouldn't know what part of a message you were replying to unless you
quoted that part.

On the other extreme, quoting an entire message and adding "I agree"
at the bottom isn't particularly good, either. You need to strike a
balance in between.



(All you jokers out there getting ready to quote this message just to
tag "I agree" at the bottom should poke yourselves in the eye
forthwith.)
