The spires in Karana.  Not the highest, but anyone who's tried to climb them
knows it's a struggle.  You're on a constant slide down, and many times,
it's impossible to make forward motion, almost like running against a zone
wall.  You've got to kind of shimmy up it, weaving from side to side, a jump
here and there.... it's a pain.
