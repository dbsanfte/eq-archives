I actually think this rating is for when things have gotten to the
point that a mezz isn't going to do any good.

Bring it on.  I can get my stuff mezzed faster than any enchanter I
know, though I have trouble keeping more than 4 mezzed at once.  I can
do 5, but I really want to have a shammy slowing at that point.
Granted, the best enchanters can keep up to about 7 or 8 mezzed, if
they come in 2s and 3s.  I have yet to see an enchanter who can handle
it when 8 or so jump you at once.  At that point my job is to hit my
AE slow/snare and pull enough aggro to allow cleric to run or gate.

I can mezz basically anything up through level 56.  I was
crowd-control on 2 of 3 passes through to Juggs last night, and that
was with two level 60 chanters.  I don't have dictate though, so I
couldn't charm the Juggs that added, but I could and was slowing them
until the Shammy could overslow.  Come with me to Plane of Mischief
and see how a bard mezzes stuff that resists a chanter.  I had NEVER
taken over CC from a guild chanter until PoM, but resists were just
too high, stuns were laughed off, and chanters were dead in about 3
hits.
Name a place where an enchanter can mezz that a bard can't.  I still
haven't turned in my pieces for HS, but that's the only place I could
think that I haven't experienced directly.  Disco, King, Reets in Seb.
Pit and Village in Velks.  Everywhere in KC.  Maybe swirlspine
seahorses in SG, they do seem to resist mezz every now and then when
I'm swimming across.  I can either mezz stuff in DN, or an enchanter
needs to charm it.

Yep, I thought this stuff was the be-all and end-all too until I saw
it fail to do much of anything to certain mobs.

Hmm, nice in practice.  I've heard enough 'resisting stun' recently to
make me think this may not be quite as effective everywhere.   But
it's very possible I'm thinking of stun to interrupt cheals and the
color series is slightly different.

I keep hearing that, and so I will join groups with an enchanter.  I
sit back, and when the chanter dies I take over.  Generally after the
chanter is ressed I continue to do CC.  I'm not saying that a bard is
alwasy better than an enchanter, and in certain zones (deep in Chardok
especially) where wanderers just keep coming and coming, I much prefer
having an enchanter along.  For most 53+ exp grinding though, Velks,
Seb, KC basement, PoM, I'm finding that I am more effective and much
less likely to die than an enchanter.
One thing that I find really works well on raids is working in concert
with the enchanters.  I aggro add, mezz them, then tell enchanter to
take over.  I hit them once to break my mezz and the enchanter then
mezzes.  You really have to have done this a lot to learn the timing
though.
I'm sure the average enchanter is better in a group than the average
bard.  Most bards are really nothing more than weak tanks with
manasong, and maybe haste/slow if the enchanter is low on mana.  A
good bard is at least as effective as a good enchanter.  Go crawling
with one someday, I'll think you'll be very suprised.

Arolpin
just play manasong
