They managed in EQ1, by putting the color on the armor slot rather than 
the armor itself.  Made it unrealistic in that any armor you put in that 
slot became that color, and if sold, the armor would not retain it's 
color.  They also did make one type of armor dyable, with the color 
remaining with the armor, crappy armor admittedly.  They did that by 
actually having different itemized equipment, one for each color.  There 
is certainly a cost though.
