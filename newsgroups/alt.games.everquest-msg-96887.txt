Glad you posted that, since I was about to anyway. Notice the very
careful and evasive "We don't plan on releasing detailed mechanics"
section, and how the rest was phrased. Call me suspicious of VI's
somewhat colored past in these areas, but *noplace* there does he
actually say "... it will require the same amount of xp to get from 30
to 50 as it does now."

What he *does* mention is "Some things people should really discover for
themselves... "  Huh? WTF? Excuse me, but not giving out information on
where the Golden Ring of Uberquestocity drops is leaving things for
players to find out *IN THE GAME* by themselves. Unless you are using
ShowEQ or some other illegal hack software, there is virtually no way
that anybody will be able to confirm exactly how much xp they are
gaining or losing at any given time, and no way to determine if the
totals are the same. It's not part of "the game". It's part of the
application design underneath.

It may be "fixed" properly. Or, it might be that "We found a way" means
they just removed them and they know that nobody will be able to 100%
tag them for it, and even if we did, the majority will keep playing
anyway.

But again, that's not the issue. Hell levels became part of the fabric
of the game society, like young men going through having their voice
change when they hit puberty. I still think these changes are dumbing
the game down to the lowest common denominator, and pandering the weak
and the whiners.
