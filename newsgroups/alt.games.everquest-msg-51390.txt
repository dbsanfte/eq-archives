Can't help you much with the video resolution thing, although it certainly
sounds like some kind of driver issue. I'm sure someone else could help,
although they will probably ask for more info, like processor, motherboard
chipsets, etc.

Yes, there are idiots in this game that get off on ruining other people's
gaming experience. There is really nowhere in life (real or cyber) to
completely avoid people like this. Just make a note of the name, and someday
you will have the chance to pay him back for his actions. I do not mean
doing the same to him, but there may be a time when he needs your help (SoW,
port, rez), and you can point out how his previous actions do not merit your
assistance (did I use 'merit' properly there?)

Which leads to the (lack of) role-playing in the game. You are correct in
your observation that there is little rp-ing in the game. For some this is
troublesome, for most it has become accepted. But, just because nobody else
does it, don't let that stop you. I rp a little, but when someone approaches
me and is obviously rp-ing, I do my best to step into character. But it can
be very hard to role play a high elf who loathes his dark brethren, when you
just might need a DE enchanter to clarity you, or a cleric to give you a
rez. The way things are on most servers, real role playing is not really
easy to do (although some will disagree.)

Since you are new, you may want to try the new RP-ing preferred server
(forget the name right now, but it has a little note in the log-on screen.)
Again, you WILL find your usual share of idiots who are simply out to level
as fast as possible and be the first to get an FBSS, or form a guild and
take down Lady Vox. But this is something that a game like EQ encourages -
get bigger and better loot. I don't blame them, hell I love to get great
stuff. I just make a point ot not inflict my desires and playing style in a
negative way on those other players around me.

Whew, I am long-winded. Anyway, keep playing. EQ is a great, if somewhat
(yeah right) addicting game. Good thing you got your wife playing. Mine
hates the game, and rightly so. I spend far too many hours playing this damn
game. You will run into idiots from time to time, but all in all the
majority of people (imo) are there to have fun without ruining it for
others. You seem to have found a couple (nice players) already. Keep
looking, you will find many more.

Enjoy,

Lefty
