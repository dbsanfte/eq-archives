Someone buys the appropriate coffin (each version of the
spell requires a different coffin);
Necro or SK and person who died go to zone where the corpse
is;
Necro or SK targets person who died;
Necro or SK casts summon corpse spell (which uses coffin as
component);
corpse appears at necro's feet (and coffin is consumed by
spell.)

That's it.

Coffins are sold in the Bazaar for the higher-level versions.
I'm not sure where the low-level coffin is sold.  Prices range
from a few(?) plat for the lower-level one to about 175pp for
the mid-range one and back to about 75pp for the high-level
version.

The higher-level version coffin is stackable.  The mid-level
one isn't and is a container (so it can't be put in another
container.)  I'm not sure about the low-level one.  The
low-level one works on corpses under a certain level (30,
IIRC.)  The others work on any corpse with the difference
being the price of the component.

High-level necros may have equipment that makes casting
the spell mana-less and/or coffin-less, BTW.  A necro who
can summon corpses w/o spending mana and coffins combined
with an epic cleric can get a wiped-out raid on its feet
pretty quickly...
