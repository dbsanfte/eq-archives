| Sign up for the EverQuest II Beta! Applications accepted starting May 3,
| 2004 at 10 AM PDT.

Taken from the EQ2 Beta signup page ....

"Note: European customers who wish to participate in a localized beta 
program may begin the beta application process on June 1, 2004."

What difference does it make where I am in the world? ... I can download the 
CD/DVD image, it'll take a while but not that long with ADSL.  It's a global 
game after all, or will be anyway, most bugs will probably be reported via 
website/email/ingame as they are now in EQ so GMs being available and/or 
awake won't make much difference unless they're going to start a 24/7 rota 
for the GMs in June.
