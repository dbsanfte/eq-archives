Ok, totally lame question time. *sigh*
I <never> seem to run across situations where I have to deal with
hardware or dig into my own machine more than every couple years. The
little I know came from watching hardware oriented friends working on
them. I used to know enough to be dangerous, but have forgotten even
that much. So...

I'm pretty sure there's an easy way in Windows 98 or at the DOS prompt
to find out what all my hardware specs are. Specifically, to verify the
speed of my processor, amount of RAM on each of our machines, which
video cards we have, sound information (are we going to DirectX 8? Will
our hardware support it?) Video/graphics card information.

In preparation for SoL I'm getting ready to buy more memory to try to
get both systems to 512 MB if they will support it, or at least 256 on
both if not. (I suspect one machine is still at 128.)

How can I find out this information so I can determine what I need to
purchase and upgrade?

Machine one is from Gateway with an approx 600 P3, maybe 18 months old.
The second is an IBM Intellistation of some model, P3 and I think a
700ish processor. They both have whatever the default video and audio
hardware was. Memory in the Gateway has been slightly upgraded once by a
friend, but still not up to snuff. IBM has the default, which I believe
was 256.

I really need to verify what I have now before worrying about what needs
upgrading to what.
TIA
