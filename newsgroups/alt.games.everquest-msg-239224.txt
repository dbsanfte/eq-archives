Based on the fact that each rare and magic item had considerable
variability. The pool of base equipment was very small though. So
particular combinations were repeated often.

The problem is that for each eq class (and for each D2 class-branch)
is that there is really pretty much a 'best set of equipment'. In D2,
even with the item variability specific variations were the 'best'. In
D2 at the endgame players approached this ideal set.

EQ, however,  is no different, just the drop rates on the 'ideal'
items are so low, and so difficult to obtain that the majority of the
player base either can't get them (due to lack of appropriate guild
association) or hasn't gotten them yet due to the drop rate... and
expansions come out fast enough that even those with the 'best set'
get obsoleted regularly.

EQ is just as susceptible to equipment convergence as D2. All EQ has
going for it is regular expansions to keep the ideal set from ever
ending up in more than a few players hands.
