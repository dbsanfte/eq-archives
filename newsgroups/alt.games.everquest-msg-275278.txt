There are teams of developers who are content to 'make the game they'd 
want to play'. Hopefully, MMORGs will sink out of the stratosphere of 
Big Business and come within reach of the dreamers one day.

I am not level 10-20 any more. But I've got a couple alts, and I'll be 
sure to run them in there for sure!

That said, I concede that I'm not -that- excited about lavastorm. But 
then lavastorm wasn't rebuilt for -me-. Its not aimed at high level 
players at all, and has nothing for them (to my knowledge at least), so 
its a poor example. Its a pretty enough zone though and if it was 
itemized and populated like WoS it would be just as popular.

That question hinges on the assumption that SOE actually has to choose 
just one. I am not arguing that they change their expansion strategy at 
all.
