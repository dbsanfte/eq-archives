}That 71.7% sell back gets you to 135. If you look at my comment.. this

}around 130-135 the failures can become an issue. And really, one ring

You say 50, I say 90, if the truth is 71.7% we're about equally right.  So 
ok then. :)  71% does seem a bit low to my recollection, not counting 
failures, but I really wasn't watching my plat anywhere near as closely as 
you apparently were.

}After that combine you have selective 2-3 ring combines you can do
}that trivial at a max of 148. Broken by recipe these are:
}Ornate Gold Chain Coif		Cost: 31855cu	Trivial: 146
}Sell Back = 20500cu
}% returned = 20500cu/31855cu * 100 = 62.4%

60 seems way too low, there's something odd there.  In general, by my 
quick mental calculations at the time, I wasn't losing more than 3-5pp per 
combine on any of the ornate recipes I did.

}Ornate Gold Chain Gloves	Cost: 35185cu	Trivial: 142
}Sell Back = 23510cu
}% returned = 23510cu/35185cu * 100 = 66.8%
}Ornate Gold Chain Leggings	Cost: 43847.5cu	Trivial: 148
}Sell Back = 23510cu
}% returned = 23510cu/31250cu * 100 = 75.2%
}None of which are even close to 90% sellback. Some of which, granted
}are a bit higher than 50%. Leggings are your best, but granted I
}haven't itemized each and every recipe. Maybe there is some recipe
}deep in ornate chain that provides this 90% return. If so, please post
}it so the next person doing ornate chain knows what his best bang for
}his buck is because most of the recipes aren't that clear cut..

Ahh... actually, this might be the source of the trouble... As I recall, I 
went almost all the way up on ornate chain and ornate electrum chain.  For 
gold, I think I only did the breastplate, for about 3 skillups (a stack 
or two of combines).

}Now, transitioning to fine plate you have:
}Fine Plate Visor			Cost: 25755cu	Trivial: 163
}Sell Back = 27000cu

Never did visors, as they were trivial before I got to fine plate, of 
course.

}Now, the unknown of course is leather padding. Some people farm all
}parts, some people farm just the silks, some people just buy in the
}bazaar for 25pp. In my case my leather padding always cost 5pp.. cause
}that's what i bought the pelts for and then farmed the silk in the
}feerott. But this was back when a couple hours of farming could get
}you 6 stacks of silk. That's why I made the statement:
}> the sell back for Fine Plate is ~ the cost of ore and molds.

And here's where we would differ strongly.  To me, not spending time 
farming green crap was paramount.  Pretty much all my spiderling silk and 
LQ pelts have come from vendor diving.  But a 5pp loss per combine 
for 100 combines or so would be greatly preferable to another 2-3 hours of 
vendor diving.  Or another 2-3 hours bashing crab spiderlings, whatever.

}You also need to bear in mind, when I was doing this.. plat actually
}meant something to me and I didn't have a lot to throw around. Having
}runs of 40 basically cost me a hundred or so pp after the bank account
}got done rolling over was grand. 

See, that seems comparable.  100 ornate combines or so, I'd be down 
~250pp.  So why waste my preciousss paddings?

}These days I'm sure the one-click
}tradeskill groupies can just dump money in exchange for bumps through
}ornate gold chain or even just buy the padding in the bazaar at 45pp
}per. I certainly have friends who weren't shy about dropping whatever
}it took in money to just get their skills as high as they could go
}once the tradeskill changes went into effect. You can pretty much
}blast most skills if you got the money to drop. After all, if you are
}advanced enough to camp TSR and roll high you'll have enough money in
}one drop to go.. why even bother farming spiderling silk?

Well, I'm level 36 again now.  TSR is kinda out. :)  Even then, I rarely 
see enough paddings/pelts for sale in the bazaar at one time to get what 
I consider to be a good run going.  I'm probably rich for a 36, since I 
spent most of the last couple months vendor diving and selling stuff in 
bazaar(*), but still, 45pp/padding?  No way!  

}>And I just did Smithing up to 180, so the memories are fresh. :)
}Did mine a while ago, but after the smithing nerf.

Yea.  It's possible prices have changed?  Or maybe it's just going the 
ornate electrum route made enough difference.  I was quite suprised that 
the cost didn't ream me nearly as much as I thought it was gonna, so it's 
quite possible the buyback prices changed.
