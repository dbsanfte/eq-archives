And my point is obsolete content isn't worth the magnetic disc its 
imprinted on even if you haven't seen it yet. Casual players graduating 
from LDoN have no interest in spending a year in Kael (etc) camping 
armor that is inferior to what they already have. New to them or not, 
its a waste of time.

Some will go just to see the sights, but that isn't going to consume 
much time, and isn't going to be attractive many players. (Would -you- 
go to the new expansion if it was itemized like Kunark? How much time 
would -you- spend there?)

As long as a midlevel player itemizes in LDoN & the Bazaar then when 
they hit the upper levels there will be no real point to all the content 
that you think is already there for them. They are far better off 
finding some corner to grind in until they can reach the 'current' 
expansion.

SOE needs to either revitalize old content, or include midlevel players 
when they target expansions.
