He himself says he wasn't involved in the WTC attack.

I don't think that somebody who masterminded the deaths of 6000 people 
in order to make a killing in the stock market selling airline and 
insurance company shares needs a lot of extra demonizing.

As for the doubtfulness of him being a frontline soldier... Reports of 
rich people in the front lines will always be met with a lot of 
skepticism from me. I'm not a great believer in "Scarlet Pimpernel" 
scenarios. People in positions of power may *pander* to fanatics, but 
they must keep a healthy dose of pragmatism themselves.
