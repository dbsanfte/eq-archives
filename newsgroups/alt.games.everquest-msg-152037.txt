Here is the first quote of your message you removed from my post before 
you replied:

"Different people have different ideas of fun. "

That's how.

Were you drinking when you posted this cause you used to at least seem 
to be rational most of the time.  How does removing:

"You may have hit the nail on the head there.
Perhaps if they were to sell premade characters,
they might hope to become "all things to all
people", and get all sorts of dollars from all
people. "

..suddenly change things so  you didn't say that?  Once you said it  you 
said it.  Snipping if from my reply before you post doesn't change the past

That does seem simple enough.  Why should they lose out on dollars from 
folks who don't want to play such a silly game if they can simply offer 
the mentally challenged version under a different title and not  only 
make all the money from those unable or unwilling to deal with the the 
unholy rigors of playing a game as well as the normal folks who actually 
play games to play games?  I think win win sounds better than lose win 
no matter what the score.  So if they decided to pimp out EQ after EQ2 
is released I'd perfectly understand.  I mean they already have, selling 
premade chars would just be stepping down from high class hooker status 
to cheap whore.  It is when new games are released with such options 
that gamers lose out.  Imagine never being able to actually play an on 
line game again if dollar bills and sloth were the key to success rather 
than actually playing the game.  Of course not being much of a gamer I 
guess such a world appeals to you.  /spits

Because if they fail to reach the hearts and minds of every individual 
their hopes and dreams as you stated them would be dashed!  How could 
they go on knowing that they were not all things to all people? /snicker
