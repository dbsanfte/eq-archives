"Local vault" servers allow outside characters in.  The game's "legal
character" filter is best described as a worthless piece of shit, it
allows characters onto your server that an illiterate 8-year-old with
an illegible BASIC manual could write code to stop.  "Server vault"
servers allow only characters created on that server to play, the player
can "export" his character as often as he likes, but can only play the
version of it saved by the server.  The problem with this is that the
server's volunteer owner/creator must provide all of the content (you
know, that stuff SOE has a staff of paid developers doing).

It is a good game.  The multi-classing mechanic hands the class balance
issue off to the players quite nicely.  There're enough in the way of
rock-scissors-paper type choices to make the class relationships
interesting.  Human is, overall, the "best" race for many class/role
choices, quite a contrast with EQ's "you're Human? sucks to be you"
philosophy.  Mob AI is grotesquely primitive, in combat the mobs
generally always and only attack whoever it was made the biggest hit
in on them (makes it dangerous for a Rogue to get involved early in
a battle).  It's possible to create scripts that'll get mobs to run
away when they're losing, or ignore you when you're so powerful they
couldn't possibly take you down, but default behavior is if they see
you and they hate you they fight to the death regardless.  Also, if
you get into a fight with a mob, whether you win/lose/flee you're now
KOS to that mob's faction.  The UI has no first-person view, and I
find it somewhat clumsy compared to EQ, but I do like their 3x16
hotkey setup.  The UI does not clip for ceilings, so players can just
go to a more distant view to see behind doors/walls.  Hmm, I've listed
more bad than good, but as I said to start, I think it's a good game
and I enjoy it when I play.
