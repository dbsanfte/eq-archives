Eh, I used to be able to alt tab out when I was running Windows 2000
before they switched over to DX8. Once the switch was made, I could no
longer do it, and it was something I missed a lot, even though I don't
have IMs or anything like that. It was very handy to be able to get
out of EQ and surf for a minute to check on an item's stats, or the
level of a mob, or the next step on a quest you're doing, or what mob
drops what, or... Well, you get the picture. It's one of those things
that after you've had it,  you don't want to give it up.
