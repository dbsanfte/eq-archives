I started in March or so, following a brief stint a few years back. I'm 
having plenty of fun. I suspect EQ, in its current incarnation, will 
last at LEAST two years. I figure it will last for one year after the 
last expansion pack for it is released, whenever that may be. EQ2 
willeventually siphon off players, but it will take a while to fully die.

Ultima Online is still going on. Hell, even Meridian 59 is still alive.
