is anyone at all interested in having even one, two, or three extra spell
slots as a choice of spending skill points post 50?  effectively this is a
movement to just get some extra spell slots thru the alternate exp method
post 50.  Its not meant to be exact in either how to achieve this or exact
numbers, but just a desire to have something along these lines put into
place.

as a rough draft I'd put it in a general slot ( 51 and over can use) with 5
skill points put in for the first level, 10 for 2nd, and 20 for third extra
spell slot.

Personally I think that as a game designer their isn't enough real choices
from the alt advancement to really differentiate between chars.

Eventually your going to get to the point where everyone is now a running
fast type of char at the vary least.  I think this will give even more
variety and make the choices even harder.

I'm mostly interested in people who like this idea and willing to back me
when I suggest it formally to absor / alan.  if you hate this idea, please
create another thread on why it is so horrible.
