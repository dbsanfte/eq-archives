Hehe, happens to everyone. The brownies tend to kill everything not in 
Wolf Form. And the brownie guards at their village are giving XP at 
level 59, so a low level char is dead if he meet a brownie. But some low 
level (1-3 i think) brownie scouts are sometimes in Gfay, find them and 
get revenge.

Hehe, at level 7 most zones are deadly, and you WILL get horribly beaten 
up for exploring them. At that level the best thing to do is to head to 
Crushbone (north of Gfay, guarded by orcs), and kill orcs in there.
