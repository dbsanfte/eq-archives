East Freeport is a fine place to swim.  I've done it many, many times with
no problem.  There is (at least) one shark but it has never bothered me.

Depending, of course, on your faction, race, etc. swimming there should be
safe.  Just keep an eye out and don't get too close to shore if you see an
enemy NPC standing there (e.g., Giz Dinree).
