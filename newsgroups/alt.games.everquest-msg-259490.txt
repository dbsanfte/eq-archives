Using a custom display?
I will say that last time I played my 2.2 ghz amd with 1 gb and a radeon 
8500 (admittedly before dx 9 et al) I noticed that PoK would go to 
slideshow mode sometimes, especially around certain areas, not 
neccessarily where there were lotsa people either.

I think Bazaar was overall a better experience... slow, but not as jerky.

I will note that my 2ghz celeron laptop with so-so video and 768 mb of 
ram did a pathetic job on EQ...
I'd rather have played on my voodoo 5 equiped p3-800 with 512 mb.
