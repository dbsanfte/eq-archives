Level restriction is still there but as with other group buff spells you
just group the lower level with you and cast on yourself. It has had a big
effect in Enchanter LFG in pick up zones like Velks. Groups get KEI and have
no need for an Enchanter. Before KEI I would walk into a pick up zone and
LFG and get 3 or 4 tells from different groups. Now I have to resort to
charm soloing for exp. Unfortunately charm was a spell designed in the days
of old world and Kunark and does not take into consideration the resists
rate of new world (velious/luclin) mobs so is practically useless. A charmed
pet also takes half your exp unless you out damage it which is difficult to
do as an Enchanter. Charm soloing usually results in exp loss rather than
gain.

Can somebody pass me some cheese to go with my whine.
