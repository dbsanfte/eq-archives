What the hell are you fuys talking about anyways? Twinking not good?
Easier to twink a warrior than a wiz? 

When making a new twink caster everyone knows the standards are 2
adamantite rings (75 hp each minus 10 magic resist but that means
exactly squat pre 20), jade gold bracers 15hp and mana each, and as
much other mana/hp gear as you can dig out of the vault on your other
chars.  Thats all that matters up until 25 or so. period.  Oh and a
weapon :)  Smoldering brand or water crystal works nicely both proc at
level 1

They say AC matters, but who cares if that moss snake hits you for 3
or 2 dmg when you have 400 hp and kill him in two swings

To prove to myself that I couldn't play a warrior, I detwinked a char
I farted around with to lvl 30, deleted him and his in spot made a
gnome warrior.  Almost all the gear was wearable by him, gave him a
Icetooth Claw (hits ridiculously hard), and was smooth sailing up
until deleted him at 20. soloing wasn't much of an option after that.
not my cup of tea. Maybe I needed a funug tunic?

my point? none
