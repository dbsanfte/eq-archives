    He's tough, but he hasn't given us issues. We find the same thing every
time - we only lose when people don't listen to instructions and bring adds.
What can you do, when you say "stay near the back wall" and you look to see
a wizard nuking from the DXXT spawn point for ten seconds before two Eoms
come cruising at him? Or "no pets" on the Aten blobs, and then you see a
mage pet (which isn't someone with a new mask) and a Flaming Sword of Xuzl
on the mob while some moron in wolfform just got shot through the roof?

    We try! ;-)

    I was cleric for the pull group last night (we just set up our first
three perma-CotH points last night), and it really gives you an appreciation
of how bad it is. "Ok, trip the first of the six traps, try to avoid aggro
on the three mobs if you can." The traps spawn what, two mobs each, some of
which can be four-arms that spawn another, lesser mob when they die? And
that's just to clear one room. When you're not in pull, you see mob after
mob come but you have no idea if any of them are repops or what. Now I know.
