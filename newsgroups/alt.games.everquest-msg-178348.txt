Here is what I feel right now....

Feel like I've done something so terrible that to apologize in writing on
here would not suffice, at the same time I realize that I'm not perfect, but
at the same time I kind of just feel an empty grey amorphous morass of pain,
like there isn't anything that can be done to fix it as it is just so
utterly tragic that it can't be described using words, on the other hand I
guess the past is the past and one shouldn't be weighed down by large
metallic chains that one would find on a ghost in hell in a Dickens tale.
