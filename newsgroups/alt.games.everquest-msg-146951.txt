Before Luclin some spells you could only gain through researching yourself
or from a player who has already researched and has scroll for sale. With
the release of Luclin some of the spells previously available through
research were made available on vendors.

Some still have to be researched, either buy them from players or do them
yourself. Research is like any other tradeskill and has to be developed.
Fails happen as with all other skills. You have to increase your skill to
stand a chance to gaining the spells you need. There are quests you can do
to raise skills but most are bugged and not worth the time to do.

To get runes, kill in areas that are appropriate for the level of spell you
wish to gain. Different zones yield different runes. Best bet is to go
vendor trawling to find the runes you require. Check Freeport, Commons,
karanas vendors and FV vendors.

Rumour command central said something about the research skill coming more
into play in PoP so maybe worh increasing skills.
