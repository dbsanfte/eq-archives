Hrm. I think it would be very tough to take Tarre (necro) and Jakiss
(wizard) into a lot of dungeons where there is no room to run if the mob
breaks root. I admit the best way two casters who aren't plugged into a
standard XP grind group to hunt in dungeons is root/rot. Jakugg (warrior)
and Tiru (cleric) spent 5 levels in Najena 30-35ish.... but if Tarre and
Jakiss had tried that, we'd have been smeared everywhere with wanderers and
adds. The casters spent that time in SK at gnolls, where we got dirty looks
for holding a spire on our own, and in GD on giants and wolves. But the
casters are deliberately fighting in different zones than the warr/cleric.

I've been on both sides of the fence, and really, you need different hunting
styles and camp grounds for whatever it is you are trying to do.

I spent  agreat deal of time today in a group in Skyfire: mage, necro,
wizard, druid, wizard, paladin. No, the pally wasn't the tank. We
fear-kited. We let the pally be the healer, and the wizards took turns
pulling. Think outside the conventional lore, and it makes for an
interesting trip. I think I'm a better player for it.
