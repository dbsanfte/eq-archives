Kithicor is a VERY bad place at night.  I have seen 50+ people waiting at
the zone line to go through.  Heck, hanging out in Highpass we used to get a
lot of good buffs that way.  Even daytime can be dangerous-my daughters 37
level druid was attacked by an Undead Reaver (I think that was the name)
during the day and even with sow she barely made it through the Rivervale
Zone.

I only went through there one time in the dark and won't ever again.  From
HP to Rivervale, a short run, I thought I would be fine.  Kithicor is darker
than other places in the dark (my half elf infravison wasn't helping much)
and I got half way and could not see anything.  Somehow I managed to keep
moving in the right direction and found the zone.  WHEW! I will NEVER do
that again EVER!

Wait by the entrance for daytime, there are always plenty of people waiting
there to keep you company. What I would do though, is go through Kithicor
and into Rivervale first.  Bind there, and then go back to look for your
body.  That way if anything happens, you are close to Kith and won't have to
make that long run from FP.

Also, any necro of 12th level or higher should have a Lesser Summon Corpse
spell.  You won't find many necros in RV, but you might find one in Highpass
that could summon your body for you.  The coffin needed is under 2pp and
they are sold in Highkeep at the vendor in the courtyard area after you zone
in.

Good Luck
