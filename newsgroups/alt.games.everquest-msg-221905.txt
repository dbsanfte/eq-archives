It all depends.  If you are not grouped, and you want to pick out a 
particular target, then, yes, you generally will find it best to use the 
mouse.  For changing your viewing angle, you can do that from the 
keyboard, you can open your inventory from the keyboard, but, you will 
need to use the mouse to select specific items out of containers.

If you are grouped, and you are not the person who is designating which 
target to take next, then you can use the /assist command to assist him, 
thus targetting the same mob he has targetted.
