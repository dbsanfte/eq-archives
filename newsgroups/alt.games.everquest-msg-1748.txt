Greg,

You may want to check out the "The Newbie Zone" section on the offical
Everquest message board (www.everquest.com). I've been lurking there, and
the posters there have started a guild on Xev. They seem like a pretty nice
group of people, and I've considered starting a new char on Xev just to hook
up with them. The new guild is called "Enoz Eibwen."

Just thought I'd pass along the info! :-)

Anita
