I feel your pain, truly (25 mage).

However I think they are incorrect now. Used to be 29-44 research spells
were available on vendors in Katta for all the int casters, but they took
them out. It was a mistake. Tyas (my enchanter) bought his 39 and 44 spells
there, then got to be embarrassed when someone else went there on his
suggestion and they weren't there (and yes, I went myself to make sure).
Pets may be there though, but the enchanter research only has been removed.
