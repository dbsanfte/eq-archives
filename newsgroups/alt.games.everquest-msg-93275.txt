No help just bad news :-(

Lvl	Number of "blue" kills required
50	72.52
51	161.44
52	171.17
53	177.18
54	284.21
55	303.04
56	322.24
57	341.82
58	361.75
59	496.10
60	290.93

So yes it is that bad or worse to 60. :-(
But it is not that much worse till you hit 59. :-)
Of course then it is a hell of a lot worse :-(
Still others have managed it so you can too :-)

I'm confused am I the good cop or the bad cop ?

Jim
(Numbers are from a make shift leveling thingie I did. Numbers are for
solo kills of median level blues e.g. for level 54 that is level 46.5
kills in a zone with 75 ZEM for a Human Fighter)
