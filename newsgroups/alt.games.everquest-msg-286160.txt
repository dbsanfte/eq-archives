Nice list,

> DATABASE / GENERAL (Spells, Items et al)
> EQ Items
> http://eqitems.13th-floor.org/index.php

Collector has been broken since early March and as such the whole 
database is out of date by 3 months.  No sign of it ever being fixed 
unless some people with the skills and time update the collector.
