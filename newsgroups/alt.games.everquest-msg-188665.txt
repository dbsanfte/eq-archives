The bazaar on my server is so crowded you are lucky to be able to go into
trader mode in under 50 clicks.

10-12 fps is acceptable when not fighting, I rarely go lower than that in
the bazaar, perhaps you need to tweak your D3D settings or your video
drivers?

It's rare that I can count the fps, and if it does get that bad I can still
hit F9, which is easier when you are hunting down an item anyway. You don't
"play" the game in the Bazaar anyway, you shop for gear or sell yours off,
only idiots ever die in the bazaar, or people pulling pranks like leaving a
row of different-sized corpses.

Not that the bazaar is a well-formulated idea in the first place, but its
biggest negative effect, the lag, can be mitigated easily.

I forgot to mention, my spell effects are never on, they are dumb anyway,
and I have a lot of things turned off, like messages for bard songs, all
non-crit melee damage, etc.

Oh, here's one thing I just thought of, do you have your chat logged? Once
the file gets over about 64K (which happens very fast), there is a
noticeable delay. Once I realised that my chat log had grown to enormous
proportions, I disabled logging completely and got rid of the offending
file. That sped up everything a whole bunch, and could be the reason my
1.1GHz system with half the video memory is outperforming yours.

I hope also that you are either running 2k/XP or have the proper memory
entries in your system configuration files, anything over 512MB on 98/SE has
problems, otherwise I'd be running 1.5GB on my rig.

P.S.: Installed EQ on my workhorse to see how it performed.

P4 2.53GHz
2GB PC2700 (or whatever DDR333 is called)
Radeon 9700 (replaced a crappy CAD/OpenGL-only board that cost 3x as much
and delivered only marginally better performance)

Turned everything on except the velious textures, spell effect on low bazaar
performance rarely dipped below 10 fps at 1600x1200
Turned off luclin models, bazaar performance never dipped below 16fps and
rarely below 30
Turned on high spell effects, bazaar performance never dipped below 12fps,
and rarely below 25
