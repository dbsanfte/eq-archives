Why didn't you guys grab an enchanter and go AE?  The bard could have used 
the wonderful seb pathing to pull without selos, or just mezzed and let 
the train come when mez broke.

Well, yeah, our damage output isn't that great, especially compared to a 
monk, and we really can do two or three things well, but we can't do 5 or 
6 things well all at the same time.  At that point the bard was stuck 
pulling, tanking, dealing damage, slowing, manaing, and doing all the 
dumb tank stuff like taking the wrong turn and falling in pits.  It's a 
big responsibility.  

Sidebar discussion:  I really wish I could find an updated version of 
Copeland's, I want to see how much damage I can do in certain situations.  
With my epic now twisting DoTs in battle may be useful in certain groups, 
but I need to know how much melee output I do.  (My Dots with epic do 
about 27hp/sec damage, about 38hp/second with my drum, but I am pretty 
sure I do more than 11hp/second with my weapons.)

Yeah, there are some groups that just aren't going to work, and that was 
one of them.  I would have probably just charmed one mob and played pet 
class and let the wizards nuke in that case.  The cleric could have 
stunned, would have been more efficient.  The group I was tanking for was 
cleric, bard, necro, necro and we were fighting undead.  All I had to do 
was keep aggro and let the pets, DoTs, and cleric nukes kill the mobs.
