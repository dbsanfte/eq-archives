I don't expect the component parts to be interchangable, but I expect 
that either car can get you the same place.

Porsches, Hondas, BMWs, and Kias can all run on the same road network. 
They can all share gas stations, car washes, parking lots, traffic 
lanes, toll booths, drive thrus, etc etc etc.

Why?

Because there are standards on vehicle width, height, bumpers, safety 
features, etc etc. There are standards on road widths, grades, turning 
radii, overpass heights, speed bump elevation, etc etc. (Its even 
multi-tiered with large trucks having special truck routes designed to 
ensure they can accomodate wider, taller, heavier, less manoueverable 
vehicles.

Every vehicle on the road can do whatever they want within those 
parameters, but they can rest assured that the roads, overpasses, gas 
station pumps, and all the other traffic network infrastructure will be 
in place and will work.

The same is not true for Windows and the rest of the computer world. 
Significant chunks of the internet can only be utilized using IE for the 
PC. This is a direct result of Microsoft leveraging high IE for PC 
marketshare to motivate the creation of proprietary internet 
infrastructure/content.

Basically it would be equivalent to Honda gaining such a large 
marketshare that they could dictate what the gas pump nozzles were like, 
patent it, and then actively push gastations into excluding non-hondas 
from making full use of a facility... presumably to motivate non-honda 
owners to switch to hondas.
