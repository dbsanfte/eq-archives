God your sad.

Do you really think we didn't think there would be bugs in something
like this. And do you really think we don't test "internally" before
it even goes out to TEST. But we don't find most bugs in-house because
in-house we don't try to rip each other off. We play the way it's
supposed to be played. A game based on a working economy and when you
have selling and buying there is that thing called Trust. But most of
these "bugs" are really Exploits that players themselves create...
Hmmm...the Bazaar is up lets see how I can steal from players
selling...Hmm...That didn't work let's try this...BINGO!! Now  I'll
run around here all day and steal...hmmm..I'll tell my guildmates....
Asshloes.
Oh, we do catch some exploits when it hits Test , but they are those
that are on test, find a exploit, don't report it because it benefits
them and when it goes live they abuse the shit out of it.
Thats why we really are sick of this shit . Most of us that were lucky
are moving on to different teams because we are tired of fixing this
pile of shit. Me personally ,as if you couldn't guess, am moving over
to SWG along with a few others. Most of the heads here are just tired
of working on this "Dying Horse". Oh, we all know there will be bugs
in the other games aswell, but damn if it isn't nice to get a new
piece of artwork from SWG and have someone tell you to work on it
today instead of EQ. And those of you that follow the actually website
know that most of the big guys here have moved on. They were the smart
ones that saw a cool game going to shit. 
I could sit here and type that EQ will die in 2 years max, without
question. But someone will reply 'No it won't cuz it makes Sony 3 to 5
million a year why would they lose that".
You are stupid because you think small.
Do you really think Sony gives a shit about a pissant amount like 3
mill?? ( Here is where some idiot will type  YES)
They make over 10 million + in electronics alone (daily mind you),
hell, some of you are even playing EQ on their monitors and PC's.
And  how much did Spiderman, MIB2 and Stuart Little net them in just 1
month. LOL.. Wayyyyy more than your EQ payments.
Maybe I'm just pissed that I'm sitting here at work , fixing shit that
moron do to ruin a game.
And trying to think of something when we go to a group meeting and the
creative director (Oxymoron) asks us " If you were an EQer what would
you liked fixed" funny thing is most people here don't even play the
game.
And I love the resumes we get from the ones we call "losers" that
really think that just because they have a 60 LVL character they are a
benefit to the company.
"Hi, I have a LVL 60 Paly and he's call Akira, But I once helped a GM
out and now I'm Akira the Benvolent. I really think I could help out
Verant because of this skill"... OMG, hey file 13 is a good thing.
And we really do think its sad when we see the same guy or gal on
everyday for 10+ hours, I mean we really do think, god, what wrong
with these folks, Don't they have friends or family, are they so
fucken ugly they only have Game friends only. Sad... But hey keep
playing, it gives me a pay check so I can go out snowboarding with the
rest of the guys here or for that kick ass weekend at Cabo during
spring break.

EQ will end in 2 years, it will be unplayable. Those of you with any
common sense now that all games end. But I know a few (?) of you
refuse to believe this. Forgive them Sony for they know not what they
play.
And we a betting some poor sack of shit will try and sue Sony for time
wasted on EQ, when it does go down and said sack has nothing to do
anymore.

OH well.

One pissed off employee of Sony/Verant.



I can hardly wait to see tomorrows results....
