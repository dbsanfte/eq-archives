The patch message for 11-21-00, when Xez came online:

-------
In other news, the Tarew/Povar split server, Xev, will be up following
the patch today. Xev is named for Xev Bristlebane, the god of fortune. We
would have named the new server under its full name if not for an attempt
to avoid confusion between the existing "Bristlebane" server (named for
Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane) and Xev.
