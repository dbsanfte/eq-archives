Umm, I think you're being silly here.  The opinion is easily supportable and
you should have recognized it as such instantly.  Let's try it this way...

I own an item.

You want the item.

If you wish to become the owner of my owned goods, you MUST offer me a
sufficient amount of other property that you own to persuade me to part with
my property.

The MUST is according to me.  If you don't offer me stuff that persuades me
to part with my goods, you ain't getting them.
