SOunds like SWG. That particular method allowed me to run anywhere,
see what was aggroing me and run like hell away. I almost never got
killed with that kinda tool from a mob. The majority of my SWG deaths
were some Rebel Scum sandbagging me in a Catina when I was AFK or at a
spaceport while zoning in.
