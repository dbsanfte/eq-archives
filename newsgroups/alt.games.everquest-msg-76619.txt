Good news and bad news.

Bad news-- I'm not Epic and don't expect to be for a while, so I've not
researched those details of the quest yet.

Good news--You don't need the password for the Cellar to get into the rest
of the Safehouse.  Back Alley / Quests / Laboratory are all open to the
public.

Good luck - let us know how it goes.
