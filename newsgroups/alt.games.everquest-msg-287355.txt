Your jewelry is an important investment, and it retains its appearance
and value longer if it is properly cared for. Here are some tips to
ensure the long life of your gems.

How to Clean Gold Jewelry

Gold is tarnish-resistant, although it can get smudged and grimy.
Lotions, powders, soaps, even natural skin oils can cover your jewelry
and cut down on its brilliance. Jewelry cleaning removes this residue
and restores the original luster of your jewelry.

Even though many commercial products are available to clean gold
jewelry, a basic solution of detergent and water goes a long way to
restore the radiance of gold, and a soft brush helps to gently clean
intricate filigree designs and stones. Every now and again it can be
helpful to soak the gold jewelry in a mixure of 1 portion ammonia and
6 parts water for about a minute. Make sure to dry and polish your
gold jewelry with a soft cloth or chamois afterwards.

Professional jewelry polishing cloths are an efficacious and
inexpensive way of keeping your gold collection glittering and
radiant. These treated cotton cloths help to dislodge tarnish and to
buff jewelry to a brilliant shine.

Never wear jewelry in the swimming pool or while doing chores. Though
gold is said to be non-reactive, the fact is that contact with
chemicals such as chlorine in pools or household cleaners will
discolor or even damage your gold jewelry mountings.

When you are not wearing your jewelry, proper storage is essential. Be
careful that pieces don't tumble together in a crowded jewel box if
you want to avoid scratching and loss of radiance. Ideally, store your
jewelry in a fabric-lined jewel case, or even a compartmentalized box
so that every piece of jewelry resides in an individual soft cloth
pouch. In damp
