I'd be interested in this information, heck, I'd like to see typical 
DPS's for all classes with some typical weapon loadouts.

I don't think, though , that asking a berserker what his DPS is, and 
comparing it to DPS you've parsed on other people in your group, is 
likely to yeild a fair comparison; unless things are radically better 
these days, my understanding is that parsing on other people in your 
group is likely to miss between 15 and 25% of their damage output, 
compared to parsing their log of the same fight.

Since what you want is a rough comparison, rather than real solid 
details, I'd advise simply finding a 65 berserk or two and inviting them 
to group with you, and parsing them the same way you have the other 
classes, that way, you'l be comparing apples to apples, which is to say 
your parse of a berserker against your parse of a rogue, beastlord, 
warrior...

Of course its possible this still isn't fair, since perhaps the sort of 
damage that your parsing of others is missing is more prevalent in say a 
SK than in a rogue, or in a mage versus an enchanter... since I dont' 
really know why a parse wouldn't get all the information (well, I can 
guess on the mage, it might not be counting his DSing of the MT), I'm 
not sure whether this objection makes any sense.

And since your test is fairly unscientific, you won't be comparing them 
against the same mob with the same buffs and debuffs, things that can 
make a radical difference from class to class; if the mob has high fire 
resist but low AC then melee probably far outdamage a mage, but with 
high AC the mage might pull ahead, for example.
