Erm, DL is adjacent to FV, take you about 10mins tops to run to KC from FV!
Oh and try using num lock... thats a goodun if you gotta type on the fly.
could even change your viewing angle so you can see any nasties on the
horizon from a nice above facing forward angle.
Course, if ya got a rez, then you dont have to.

persoanlly I dont mind em. Shit, try dieing somewhere wher you got no chance
of a cleric rez. KC/DL you will most likely easily get one if your willing
to pay. If I cant get a rez, I'll live with it. part of the game. And one
that I wouldn't like to see changed.

doesnt make any sense, maybe im bein dorf?. you got a member of your group
to pull your corpse but he was a member of another group? he changed
groups???

Mezzer shouda had them under control. If you died by one mob hittin you in
30 seconds or whatever the ld time is  then yeah that really is crapness.

greenie HG's to a 50th lvl, and you need a healing partner!!?!?! you must be
doin sommat wrong mate.

FM is also adjacent to DL. Ok so it will take you 10 mins to get there. But
instead of staying for 5 mins, why not stay for an hour, get nice and loaded
up on plat, for those future rezes >)

guess thats where playin off peak comes in... but then dieing in off peak
makes rez much harder. My point was that 50pp shouldn't be a burden at your
lvl.

Exactly, you are risking alot by this action. If I'm not comfortable with a
group in a dangerous place, I tend not to stay. As a chanter especially, if
I have to ask for symbol from the cleric, then I know I'm probably fucked
already.

But not having to run _anywhere_ and having instant teleports to where you
like would detract from the game imo. I came from UO, and I just love that
fact that you have to actually travel to places, rather than just gate to
absolutely anywhere... each to their own i guess.

Well, my guild also doesn't yet have a 56 rezer. But the xp is made up
usually on the great guild raids we do >)
