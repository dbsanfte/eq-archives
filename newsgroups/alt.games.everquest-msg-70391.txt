Killing dorfs will raise Zif faction very fast (well, if you're max
KOS to Zif, expect a few days of punting dorfs to get to non-KOS).

Killing royal dorfs will raise Tormax faction VERY fast (I mean
stupidly fast--like 7 royals for one faction level).

Raising Zek faction by killing dorfs is best left up to the
masochistic.  Let's put it this way:  My warrior twinkie started out
dubious to Zeks.  He started punting dorfs, got himself to max allied
with zifs and took enough faction hits with royals to get to warmly
with Tormax.  His Zek faction:  Dubious (yes, that's right, it didn't
fucking move).

But after turning in 30 dorf heads to Capt. Bvellos, I'm allied with
Zeks.

The key is to get to non-KOS to Zeks, then you can farm dorf heads for
a few days to get to allied with Zeks.
