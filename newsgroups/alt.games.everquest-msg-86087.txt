Exactly, someone did the same thing to someone in my guild. Not only
did they sell off what they could.. they then destroyed all no drop
items so he got the character back naked. He of course had shared his
info with the wrong person(s).

Every case like this is sharing info. No one gets your login id and
your password in another way. As freely as people share info in my
guild I could have 15 or more accounts tomorrow and then totally ream
them. I just don't want to do that to anyone but some people do and
some people are desperate for money. This is easy cash for a 15 year
old in about the only way a 15 year old can make much cash.

Every time I see in guildchat a class like a chanter or cleric going
"well I have to go anyone want to play me for the rest of the raid?" 
I cringe, its just so incredibly stupid. I just feel like saying "WAKE
THE SAM HELL UP."
