Go to the Gorge of King Xrobb.  It's North of EK.  In the "pupil" is a 
double spawn of Evil Eyes / Lord Svir / Lord Srkl ( spelling wrong on both, 
I think ).  If you can get the spawn broken, you can rack up very fast cash 
here.  If the middle guy pops, he's tougher.

These guys drop good cash, gems ( amber, jade, pearls, topaz ), and the 
occasional Polished Bone Bracer.  It's sick how much $$$ you can make 
there.  I went there for the Optic Nerve Bundles for my warrior and drop in 
there all the time now when I'm in the area and bored.

If you haven't slaughtered a bunch of goblins, you can sell and bank in 
Runnyeye.

Kill all the Muddites and Minos in the area to up your goblin factions some 
more, which killing the eyes also does.
