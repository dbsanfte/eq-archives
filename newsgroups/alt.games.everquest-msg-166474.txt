Thanks Chris, this is my main concern.  Since the "3rd Account" wasn't
originally mine I was hoping I wouldn't encounter a problem.  Since you took
over your brothers account I assume you had no problems either.  Could you
explain how exactly the transfer works?  I mean, does it happen right away,
does a GM need to get involved, etc.

Thanks for any info, Danny
