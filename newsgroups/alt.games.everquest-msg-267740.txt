Unless you use the "Yell for help" option, which means the encounter is worth
no exp / loot to anyone, anything the higher level killed would respawn as
soon as he broke contact with the group.  They're linked.  They spawn at the
same time, and either they die at the same time or they don't die at all.

If you run from the encounter without calling for help, as soon as the mobs
decide to stop following you, they instantly regenerate to full health, and
all debuffs are gone.

It's impossible to train someone in this game.(1)  Any mob that is not
standing at its spawn point appears to lose all proximity aggro until it
returns to where it spawned.  Even if 4 ruins stalkers are pulled to me and
lost aggro right as the got on top of me... and I happened to be killing an
unrelated ruins stalker at the same time.  None of them would attack me unless
I hit them first.



(1) Something which makes remembering this post extremely amusing.  (Yeah, you
may have to recombine.;p)
