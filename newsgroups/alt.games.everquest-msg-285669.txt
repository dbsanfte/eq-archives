There's a druid port in in FV?  I think you mean DL, yeah there are some 
undead there  in the hidden valley, but they'll be easy to clear out, I 
agree.

Not all undead don't run, and not all live mobs do run, but I can't 
think of specific examples, so this is hampering my ability to come up 
with a good route for using the mass DS plan.

Gunthak has a great many undead on the beach, which don't run, although 
with the current Hot Zone status of Unrest it might be better to stick 
there.

City of Mist has undead but they are mixed in with live mobs, might be 
troublesome.

How about LGuk, do the undead frogs run when near death?  Thats a hot 
zone, for the bonus.

It might be better to give up on the "no runners" scheme, after all, the 
principle reason for avoiding runners is that you're killing mass 
quantities rapidly, and the drain on mana to snare them all becomes 
problematic.  However, Berserkers snare without using mana.

Also, many mobs which are runners don't run unless they are the last mob 
remaining alive.  If I'm continuously grabbing new mobs to the horde, 
perhaps most of the kills would be of non runners, and I'd only have to 
deal with the occaisional "last mob standing"

Another thought; faction work. If I can find some quests or etc. which 
require a lot of faction killing, perhaps I can combine utility for the 
PLer with exp for me.
