As the other poster said... you've basically defined God as 'that
which cannot exist' and then smugly concluded that he doesn't exist.
Hardly profound or interesting. If your going to insist on God's that
can't exist then its of little interest that you can't find them.

Hardly. The test for a werewolf would be pretty simple I think. And
unlike producing a verifiable God, you'd think a werewolf wouldn't be
that much work to roll out on display either.
