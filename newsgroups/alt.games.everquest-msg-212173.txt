I think the numbers are skewed a bit more than that towards the heal
over time spells. You seem to often (always?) get at least one extra
tick out of it, like you do with DoTs. Even with SCR1, I could often
Quiessence back to full after one cann5, which tells me that Q was
healing 6 ticks for 1800.

At least on my server, Q was selling for less than Torpor. Before
spending 50k for Torpor (down to about 35k now), I'd bite the bullet
and level to 65 with Kragg's and Tnarg's. Otoh, research pages seem
pretty common these days, chardokB and SolC being good spots from what
I've seen. You might well be able to get Torpor without paying for it.

The main problem I saw with the Kragg's for mana regen (I was 60 w/o
torpor when that spell came out) was that I had to be down 2k
hitpoints for full efficiency. That made it a difficult spell to use
during combat. ... especially since my hitpoints at the time where
only around 2k.
