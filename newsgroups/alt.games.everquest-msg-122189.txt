I can back up Jazz in affirming that if you stay down till the DoT wears off
then your fine when you pop back up... until last patch. I do know that
"/pet health report" was broken last patch, unless my system or install has
become buggy. I get no reports anymore since the last barrage of patches.

Over the weekend I was stirring up the Ry'Gorrs again, and noticed a little
dark blue conning Coldain Dorf that the Ry'Gorr emmissary would run off to
chat to. I figured he was up to no good so after the Ry'Gorr emsissary
wandered off, opened with my normal Dooming Darkness on him. It was resisted
so I sent the Gimp in and tried again, resist. Then I noticed a second
version of him still coming straight for me, it must have been that 2 spawns
on the same spot bug. I feared him, but it resisted.... (uh oh).

I would repeatedly get range,  attempt to fear (all resisted) and feign.
Feign would work normally on the way down, but after I popped back up they
would both aggro from over the horizon again. No DoTs  had stuck as
everything was resisted. This scenario continued over about 4 cycles till I
worked my way to zone. I just assumed it was a buggy mob or zone or
something but there could be more to it I guess.

Will have to try some more tests tonight to see for sure.
