The cubes are awesome fun. A single group can take them without issue and
happily wander around waiting for respawns whacking the drakes and stuff. 

As an aside... the Loachs.... Holy jesus they're FAST. I was wolfed,
I think, and barely stayed ahead while I was pulling by jumping
around corners and deliberately cutting edges I knew they'd path
the "middle route" around.... My god. Nasty pulls.... if I got
stunned.. .brrr ;)

Loot was pretty crappy, although neko enjoys her new 16% haste boots
and I have winters fury as a swap out when I get an enchanter who
panics at me proccing slows and dots...

The flurries are nasty. We actually died to the CH bug on those ;(
Yuck. "HAS BEEN COMPLETELY HEALED." ... takes another 600 or so
damage .... "HAS DIED"

WTF?

Sui, still trying to swim inside the gooey cubes ;)
