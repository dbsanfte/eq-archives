I will try to answer your questions to the best of my ability.  And from
what others who have grouped with me have said, it's a good ability :)

<<<SNIP>>>
""" Now my BF and I BOTH want to know, how do you find a GOOD group.  (Well,
as I
 have read the entire 43 posts on "pulling" what I really want to know is
how to
 find a good LEADER?)"""

Good groups are hard to find, but not impossible. You will find more bad
groups than good ones until you start to understand what a good group acts
like. For instance, one idiot does not make a group bad, he'll either be
ignored or disbanded. Alot of them can make you dead quick.

 """As a shaman, do i buff or fight?"""

As a shaman, you will usually be the 'secondary' healer. If there is a
cleric in the group, you buff the tanks, then save mana for heals when the
cleric yells OOM! And if the tanks are doing their job well, you can get
some licks in without fear of retribution.

 """And if I'm the buffer shouldnt the tanks TELL me which buffs they
want?"""

As a tank, I can tell you that we need AC buffs and SOW, anything else is
gravy. AC is god to a tank, and SOW helps us keep up with wounded mobs that
run, plus helps us run back to the group after it's dead. Plus it helps us
run to the zone when things go wrong.

 """Shouldn't the leader DIRECT me as to my part?"""

I think you may be a little off on your definition of 'leader'. A good group
doesn't have a leader per se, because everyone knows their job. When you
look at the group window, the person who's name is in yellow is the one who
started the group, but not neccessarily the leader.

""" As a ranger, I know it will be harder to find a group and I don't want
to be a "mana hog"."""

I'm not sure what you mean by 'mana hog', but Rangers make good secondary
tanks. They also make good pullers (will cover that in a moment). And they
can help heal during down times.
(they can heal, can't they? I think that was a ranger healing me this
morning in my HH orc group)

""" I assume if I am agroed I just quit hitting until the monster goes after
the REAL tanks?"""

If I'm reading this correctly, then no. If you just stand there not
fighting, the mob will go after the real tank once you are DEAD. Since we
want to avoid that, if you are agroed, make sure the tank knows it. Most
tanks will taunt as much as possible, so even if you keep hitting they'll
still go after the tanks. So if you get agroed, make sure you are near the
tanks, don't make the tanks come to you.

""" And if I'm the puller ... well... again... shoudln't the leader DIRECT
me as to when to pull?"""

Rangers make really good pullers. They can pull mobs from a distance (gotta
love bows), and once the mob agroes, just run back to the group. The tanks
will get in front of you to intercept the mob, kill it, you run out to pull
again, etc etc etc

As for directing when to pull, I listen to the casters as to when to pull.
We had a tank (me), ranger, shaman, pally, chanter, and wizzie. Pally and
shaman were taking turns healing for lack of a true cleric (HINT: learn bind
wounds. really helps save on mana when things are slow). If one caster said
OOM, I pulled. When they all said OOM, I sat down.


<<<SNIP>>>
""" My shaman gets invited to groups alot - my ranger rarely...."""

Shamans: buff machine, SOWer, heal/cure abilities ... gee, I have no idea
why they would do that   :)

 <<<SNIP>>>
""" And, lastly, do I tell the Leader that I am new to grouping and need
advice,
 (seems ridiculous at level 24 plus) or do I just jump in there and possibly
do
 stupid things?"""

 NO! Dear Lord no, don't just jump in and do stupid things. That gets you
killed, the group killed, kicked out of the group, given a bad reputation,
not invited to play any reindeer games ....

Seriously though, let people know if you are new to grouping. Level doesn't
matter, everyone has to start sometime. And if someone tells you to do
something, listen. Everyone will be more helpful if you show you want to
learn.

This, of course, is one little dorfs opinion. I'm sure others will give you
helpful advice. And to anyone who thinks I'm full of it, in the immortal
words of The Human Torch, "Flame on!"
