	What's wrong with it is it fucks over the game.

	What's a SSoY worth on your server?  Let me answer for you: it's VT.  Why?
Because any twit with 800 pp can have a Centi LS.  As a result all the content
in between level 1 and Maiden's Eye is wasted, because nothing you get from
hunting in those areas is worth using.  Because weapons with ungodly ratios
that drop off level 50+ critters weren't made NoDrop or level-capped, so they
end up in the hands of level 1 characters.

	Not to mention that it's damned annoying to the real newbies to have to
watch twinks with gear they probably won't have even when the level up plow
through everything in sight.
