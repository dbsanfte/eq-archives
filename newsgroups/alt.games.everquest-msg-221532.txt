Well sure, why would he?  If you go to your next job interview
and tell them you want twice the pay they are offering, they are
perfectly free to dismiss you out of hand... or to figure you
must be the best thing since deep fried oreos and hire you on the
spot.

COnventional wisdom in EQ is probably going to lean in the
direction of your fuckwit plan, but thats the risk you take
trying to roleplay a greedy bastard in a "we are the worlds"
player population.
