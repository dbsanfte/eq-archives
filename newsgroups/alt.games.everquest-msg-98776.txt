Ok this kind of logic totally astounds me. Let me get this straight
you are actually defending a feature you hate and couldn't wait
to get rid of? /boggle

As an RPG and a game that is enjoyable to play it should be a
game of progress and gain not one of relief at having finally gotten
rid of some hindrance or annoyance.

Tell me what other 'feature' of the game is a 'relief' that we can't
wait to get rid of when we level? Spells? Hit points? AC? Abilities? Nope
those are all gains not removal of an annoyance. I can't think of any other
feature like the spellbook. Can anyone else?

Sorry I just don't get the logic of the spellbook. It was a stupid design
decision that should have never left beta.
