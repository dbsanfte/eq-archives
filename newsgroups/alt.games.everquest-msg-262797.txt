Vanquisher=some sort of tank I presume. Im not that savvy with the new 
titles yet.
I understand how you feel. For a tank tho, hp/ac and aa's determine the 
groups level of play more than other factors, such as FT, or nuke spells.
If it wernt for the 6k tanks with 12 aa's who get themselves into OOW/vxed 
groups (and ruin everyones time), people wouldnt ask.
Ive had some major time wasted because we took the wrong tank. Sorry if that 
sounds elitist, but its no fun when ppl keep dying because the MT cant do 
his job.
