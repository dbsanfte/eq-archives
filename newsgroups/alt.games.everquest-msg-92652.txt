If you are not sure what to spend them in then it is best not to spend them
yet. Wait until you identify a need or shortcoming in your own character
before spending them. Remember that saved points is potential and not
wasted. You never know what you may need them for in the future but if they
are not there to spend then you will have one less solution.
