    Offence will go up on the shield, other weapon skills will be OK if the
person keeps swinging away (they seem to go up faster vs. reds), ditto
Defense. Spell skills likely won't be CLOSE to cap, but those can be raised
chain-casting level 1 spells quickly enough. Special skills will also stink,
but I can only think of a few classes (monk and rogue come to mind) where
the "special skills" are important.

    SLN, Chloro. Usually outpaces any damage something that low can dish
out, with the occasional heal tossed in when the person being PL'ed pulls
WAY too much. Watching someone PL a level 9, then 10, then 11 cleric in The
Warrens, I can see that happening. ;-) The Warrens isn't an AWESOME place to
PL, by the way - mobs will run at low HPs, and will only stay on the person
being PL'ed if the PLer does NOT interfere with them and the PLee gets low
on life.
