If the stuff that drops on the mob is no-drop, then there's every
chance that they have called in someone not in their group to
come loot it.

If its droppable gear, there's no excuse for not looting the
bodies if they might have something you want.

If you are quad kiting or chain killing so fast you can't
get back to the bodies within two minutes, well thats
the price you pay, in my opinion, and not much of
a price at that.

If you see someone standing on top of  a mob waiting,
or you see a bunch of random die rolls coming up,
you have to figure the loot is claimed and just not
being picked up because they haven't decided who
owns it or its not lootable yet.

But in your circumstance, an unguarded body with
droppable loot on it... frankly its littering.  You aren't
merely within your rights to loot it, you are doing the
world a favor by cleaning up the clutter that can
interfere with targetting and add to zone lag.

The only class I can think of that might have a legitimate
beef here would be a soloing bard.  Bards can charm
kite mobs they can't otherwise kill, but doing so means
always facing at least one mob when the first drops, and
can be time consuming and requires some space.  You
might see a bard killing mobs and having to make a looping
arc around in order to come back for the loot, or finishing
off his former pet before returning... still, two minutes is
a very long time to be doing that, and the bard Can put
his pet on track, Selo way ahead of battle, loot up, and
go back in.  If loot is really important, going to the extra
effort would perhaps be worthwhile.  If the bard doesn't
want to bother, he's really got no good leg to stand on
in beefing when you clean his kills up... just a slightly
better bum leg than anyone else.
