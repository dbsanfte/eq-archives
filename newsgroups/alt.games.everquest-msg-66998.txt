Though I don't agree with the tone of the OP, I do agree with the
problem. 

Before the Sunday AM Patch, I could log on (though crashed 75% of zones)
every time.

After the patch I was getting 'You have been disconnected' instead of
the char select screen, every single time. dbg.txt showed this was
because of 'g_world is NULL' when trying to load char select screen.

After about 6 hours of this, the patcher picked up a message (but no
files) and I could suddenly log in again, but with constant 25-40% pl
(both in and out). Could tracert my game world without problems.

Chat was filled with people having the same problems with *this* patch.
3 General chats, Tech Support open, but full 95% of the time. Funnily
enough, the most useful room was a playermade chat channel called '-Tech
Support-'. Since there were no GMs, there were also no annoying idiots
spamming their problem, and between us, we could actually help a lot of
the simpler issues and get people playing.
