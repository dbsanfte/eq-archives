Apart from the fact you are running old Nvidia drivers (update those if you 
get a chance)
What net connection are you using? I had an issue going back a while now 
with my internal software modem.. went mad with it.

I recall when I had those problems then, some people here mentioned internal 
software modems using hadrware resources needed by the game to run, caused 
conflicts, either the modem shat itself or the game.
