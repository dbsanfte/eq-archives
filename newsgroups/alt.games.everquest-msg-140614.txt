Well, the removal of the cap has had *some* impact already. :-)

Last night, only a few hours after the patch was finished, the existing
record for manaburn was broken by a Sorcerer on Prexus who was already
in gear that had him over the cap.

Manaburn for 22780 that dropped Gore. Current estimates are that we'll
be seeing a 25K crit before very long, and it theoretically could break
30K by a fair bit.

There's a link on the front page of Graffe's discussion if ya want to
see the screen shots.

"As long as we're offering him advice, we could add this: Instead of
taking up tailoring, get a ball peen hammer and whack yourself on the
head every 15 minutes. Over all, it's certainly less painful, and very
probably more productive."
