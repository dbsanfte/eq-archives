on trying to load the ability to create a character off the CD my screen 
locks up and goes black.  My video card is supported according to the system 
scan, I have a Radeon 9600 card with 128 mb texture, my ram is at 512mb, I'm 
connected through broadband.  My only possible problem is that my CPU 
processor is at 930 MHz, while the required is 1.0 GHz, can that small a 
difference lock everything up?  I've already ordered a new system anyway but 
was hoping to at least reserve my name, etc.

Thanks.
