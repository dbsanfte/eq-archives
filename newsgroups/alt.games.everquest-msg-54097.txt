Depends on what you want to do with it. Make your own armor, arrows or
jewelry, the choice is easy. If you want to make cash I would advise jewelry
(need a LOT of pp to start with) or smithing. If you just want to have fun
I'd suggest baking and brewing because of the low cost to make things.

Usually it is wise not to start tradeskills unless you can spare some pp. My
mage (lvl 48) is just now getting them up because of some quests which
require tradeskills. I've noticed I already burned over 700pp and I'm not
even master in the more expensive tradeskills.

Also note that several tradeskills require other tradeskills to usually
skill 40 or so. Good example is tailoring which requires metal bits and
boning from smithing, and bakery which requires tins and pots from pottery.

Being a druid with foraging you can decently start some brewing because a
lot of brewing recipes require foraged stuff. Keep the crap you loot and try
to convert it to some nice alcoholics the next time you're in town :)

Also nice is to keep a fishing pole and some bait (or foraged fishing grubs)
ready for when you need to med and are near water. Fishing goes up painfully
slow and it's the one I would suggest starting at a really early age. My
mage bought himself a pole at lvl 7 for instance and fished in Crushbone
when medding.

Take a look at www.eqtraders.com for a lot of recipes and some guides.
