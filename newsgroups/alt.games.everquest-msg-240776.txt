From the shadows, the mysterious Mary.Poppins@perfect.com (Mary

Well... more dubious than frightening.


>What and no death toll / casuality rates either?  

Ah but how do you decide what is an EQ death and what is a death from
someone who plays EQ?


>X suicides.

There's been a few no doubt about that.


>X cases of child abuse, neglect, etc.

And a few of those, generally the sort of people who would have done
so anyways though.


>X stalking convictions

Convictions? None that I have heard of. But plenty of just plain old
stalking, some people are freaky. Heck if I can get stalkers just from
posting in a newsgroup imagine what Andrew would be doing if I had a
hot wood elf chick (or guy, if he leans that way) picture in my sig?
:-)


>X death threats

Oh I am sure those are happening minute by minute.
