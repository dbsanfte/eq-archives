While I agree with a lot of the comments posted so far on this
subject...there is one class whcih you all are severly neglecting. The
Wizard.  On my Account i have the following characters:-

Necromancer Lvl 53
Druid Lvl 55
Wizard Lvl 52

and of course a couple of other low lvl chars for fun.

As you can tell i have been playing EQ for a pretty long time.  And i like
to solo (aswell as raid).  Now Wizards as they are without certain
items/pieces of equipment are not great soloers.  However when you get two
items imparticular a wizard can REALLY shine.  These Items in order of
importance are:-

Journeymens Boots
Staff of Temperate Flux

Now a wizard with Jboots can quad kite faster and more effeciently both mana
and time wise than any druid. (Please not i am talking about 51+ here.  Pre
51 a druid can sometimes perform better than a wizard and sometimes the
wizard will win)

My lvl 52 wizard quad kites Raptors in Timorous Deep and has between 1 bub
and two bubs of mana left over at the end of the fight.  The big Bonus with
with wizards and quad kiting is the effectiveness of their AE snare. (Druids
have to snare each mob to pull then round them up and AE kite) Although
Druids do get an AE snare at high level, it doesnt last very long and IMO is
not that good.  Secondly Wizard AE spells are simply a lot better than
druids.  Particularly from 51 onwards.  They are much more mana effecient.

My Necro on the other hand is King of killing a single mob effeciently.
especially when fear kiting high HP mobs.

When looking at the soloing qualities of a class you have to take into
account the environment they are soloing in.  My list would go as
following:-

Outdoor zones
1. Wizard
2. Druid (close until 51 then the wizard pulls away)
3. Necro
4. Mage

Indoor Zones
1. Necro
2. Mage
3. Druid
4. Wizard

I have timed and compared my druid/necro/wizard on soloing outdoors and by
the time my Druid has killed 4 high blues quad kiting my wizard has killed 4
and medded back over half his mana bar.  My necro when fear kiting can just
about keep up with the druid (if medding during most of the fight) but not
always.  In indoor zones it is a completely different story.  The pet
classes rule in these situations.

One other thing about effeciency in wizard quad kiting is the staff of
temperate flux (wizard only)  It is an item which u can leave in a general
inventory slot and u can right click it to cast while running.  This will
aggro mobs and lower their cold/heat resistances by 10 (6 in PvP) therefore
wizards have the ability to pull all 4 mobs without ever stopping.  They
then run around the mobs a couple of times and run off in a straight
line.....turn around and AE snare all 4 mobs at once.  VERY effecient use of
time and mana.

I really feel as though people underestimate the wizard class when it comes
to soloing.   IMO a well equiped wizard in an outdoor zone will beat any
other class.

Please feel free to disagree with me.  I am just stating my conclusions from
my experience 8)
