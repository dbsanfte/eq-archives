    This is much further in.

    The original Ring of Fire still drops better stuff than the end
encounter in the zone. Acrylia, right now, is the single biggest POS Verant
has ever churned out. I do NOT look forward to going there for my Vex Thal
shard.

    Isn't pretty much everything on FV droppable? These keys sound like
exceptions now.

    But, if people didn't have to pay for keys then they'd swarm up there
and fight multiple death touching mobs for a random chance at their quest
pieces for sub-par gear dropping! The game as we know it would be ruined!

    Doing that would make the moss snakes drop 999 pp 999 gp 999 sp 999 cp,
so they couldn't do that. It also wouldn't have so thoroughly hosed the PvP
players that had banks filled with this stuff.

    Funny, some people got a laugh riot out of that. My personal favourite
was when the kodiaks would start yelling that we had failed.
