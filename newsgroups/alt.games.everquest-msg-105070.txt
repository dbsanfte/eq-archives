/sigh  I tested the assertion (made in another thread) that your
displayed AC is a "stat" directly affecting combat.  My experience,
and what I had read elsewhere, indicated a contrary conclusion and
so I devised a simple and obvious test that was straightforward to
perform given the restriction of a single account.  Please note that
when you and sanjian speak of hidden modifiers you are supporting
the meat of my conclusion, not refuting it.  Your displayed AC is
of questionable value in gauging your combat capability.

Note that a similar conclusion has already been reached by others
who tested the effect of STR on combat, using the same character
wielding the same weapons to attack an NPC who always spawned at
the same level (some FP guard was the chosen victim as I recall).
While boosting STR results in a dramatic (nearly one for one)
boost in your displayed ATK, no change in hit frequency and only
a small change in average damage per hit (less than 0.5% of the
base damage of the weapon per STR increase).

As to determining that at L1 to 4 AC is not terribly important, I
did _not_ demonstrate any such thing.  If, instead of presuming
some invisible magical "anti-twink" code, you actually consider
easy ways to implement the combat system that have the convenient
side-effect of minimizing the net effectiveness of armor (not AC,
armor) at low levels, you can come up with a number of tests.
For example, I can, and will, allow Beetmi to be assaulted as he
is now (L4 20 Defense) while wearing his armor.  I expect that
the result will be no significant change in the mobs hit
percentage (ca 43%) while roughly halving the average damage per
hit (to a value close to the 1.90 observed while armored at L1).
If my results deviate markedly from expectations I'll revise my
working hypothesis, but I'm not going to waste time speculating on
the possible existance of some bogus Rube Goldbergish "anti-twink
code" just because you think that maybe it's something they might
have done (not that they're incabable of doing such a thing, heh).

Instead of elevating unsupported guesswork to the level of belief,
you might try coming up with a working explanation and then testing
it.  I've played a number of chain- and plate-class twinks at one
time or another, and I used to entertain myself by trying to kill
mobs I knew to be very lo blue while my paladin was on corpse runs
with only his buffs and summoned hammer.  I've seen the difference
between fighting a LOIO Sabretooth while wearing banded or wearing
crafted.  Everything I have observed in game has pointed me towards
the hypothesis:  "EQ melee is resolved by first, determining whether
hit is scored, and if so determining the damage done".  I have not
encountered any evidence to the contrary.  The one controlled test
I've run to date is supportive.  If you wish to believe otherwise
go right ahead, but don't expect me to give the same weight to your
speculation as I do to my observations.  If you want to convince me
then produce data from a repeatable test.
