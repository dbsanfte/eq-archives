The puller should always be the toughest tank in the group. Its not
really to do with agro management or finding mobs but simply the fact
the tank can take the most damage. My experience of scouts pulling is
the often get wiped out fast, unlike the tank.

It also makes it easier to kill the mob if only one char pulls and has
aggro on them. People (especially the mages) can then target that
character and know they will all hit the same creature.

A scouts roll is really to point out where mobs are, open chests and
kill (they are better then the tank at attacking)

Having said that though it does depend a bit of the creatures and
levels of people. For example, while killing scarecrows in Antonica by
wizard was the best tank in the group simply because she was the
highest level and scarecrows could barely hit her. Did a fair amount of
damage when they did hit though. ^_^
