No rock-hard specifics, but apparently a guide brought folks, as you
said, from Freeport to OoT. Upon arrival at Sister's, a new ship showed
up, the "Deep Tomb". But (get this!) the *SHIP* was a NPC. A GM at
that!. There was also another GM "onboard" and yet another on the
haunted isle. Some monk or something, all sailors, all part of the
storyline. The island was populated with multiple extra gargoyles, and
four extra *wandering* specs in addition to the four normal ones up at
the temple area. Great fun, from what I hear, and on at least one server
all the PC victims got GM rezzes afterwards.
