Depends on how important you think Myasthenia Gravis is.

It is a valid, controlled, test of exactly what he set out to test.  The 
fact that it is not valid or controlled for the many other purposes you're 
trying to read in to it is irrelevant.

-All- He wants to do is show that a character having a higher AC 'stat' is 
not necessarily better prepared for combat.  It doesn't really matter if 
he's comparing apples and oranges as long as they are both characters, who 
have AC 'stats' whose numbers are known, and something has been determined 
about their combat effectiveness.  The test you apparently want to see is 
one that proves that a character that has a higher AC 'stat' than another 
character of the same level, class, defense skill, stats, weapons, 
encumbrance, AC, etc.  is not necessarily better prepared for combat.  
That's not likely to be true, and luckily, isn't what he was trying to 
show.

If you want to prove that his test of his hypothesis was in some way 
invalid, you must show either that the character's AC 'stats' did not 
differ in the way he reports, or that their melee effectiveness did not 
differ in the way he reports.  Whinging on about how they were different 
levels may give you some personal pleasure, but it isn't really relevant.

Consider this.  A scientist wants to test whether a coin, when flipped, 
will come up heads approximately half the time.  He flips a penny 1237 
times, and 612 of them come up heads.  Then he flips a quarter 1539 times, 
and 778 of them come up heads.  Your complaint about his experiment is 
like complaining that this experiment didn't use pennies both times.  Now 
if the scientist were trying to test whether pennies came up heads 50% of 
the time, you might have a point.

Well, actually, what he's testing is more like, 'can I design a penny that 
won't come up heads half the time', but he successfully does.  Probably 
attached a little weight to one side.  QED.
