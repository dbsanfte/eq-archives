Typically, the original seed is "lost" after you've generated your
first PRN.  In many algorithms, the PRN itself replaces the seed.
For example, consider this algorithm:

PRN = Previous_PRN * 214013 + 2531011

In this case, it's fairly obvious the high-order digits are the
PRN you'd return to the caller.  The caller can then narrow down
the range appropriately using modulus arithmetic.

The act of seeding this rather simplistic PRNG is in fact just
setting the Previous_PRN before generating the first PRN.

Re-seeding PRNG's is often a BAD thing.  The algorithm *itself*
is, generally speaking, better at keeping the random sequence well
distributed than it would be if you tried to re-seed it regularly.

In effect, re-seeding your PRNG can actually be detrimental.
Assuming the PRNG is a good one, with a nice, long period, of
course!

As far as (a) is concerned, I suspect EQ either uses a crappy
PRNG, or they've used a streaky PRNG on purpose.

As far as (b) is concerned, I'm not sure there's enough evidence
to support your conclusion, but perhaps they do, in fact, throw in
an extra variable (your orientation) to help modify the result of
the PRNG.  It's not uncommon for some PRNG's to use human input
(like the exact nanosecond you clicked your mouse) to assist in
the generation of PRNG's.

In fact, most of the really good PRNG's used in things like
slot machines, poker machines, craps machines, etc. in Las Vegas
and other gambling establishements generate PRNG's *constantly*,
every millisecond (or faster).  The moment you pull that lever
on the slot machine, it grabs whatever PRNG happens to have been
the one generated at that moment in time.

It makes cheating virtually impossible.

LOL!  Quit talking about Darktyger that way.
