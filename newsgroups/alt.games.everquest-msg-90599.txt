It's all about economics.  You bring the demand, you can bet your ass they
will bring the supply.  And right now, the demand still seems to be focused
in North America.

Easier that way, I suspect.  I imagine they'd prefer to run the patch into
all of the servers at once, rather than do all the work twice -- once for
all the Stateside servers, once for your server.

There's that mean old supply and demand thing again.  If Sony thought they
could sell the product well on Mars, there'd be a shipment on its way by
now.

And Sony is a Japaneese company (the parent company is anyway -- they do
have a subsidiary with the same name in the U.S.), which just goes to show
they are also willing to market beyond their shores if enough consumers are
waiting with credit card in hand.

You been peeking through my keyhole again?  Haha!  Except the flabby
ass/arse thing.  I'll bet you a handful of cash I can beat you in the 400
meter.  Or I would, but that's just internet tough talk unless I can prove
it (which I guess I can't).

You sure are a busy body.  Telling people what to do as if you have the
power to tell anybody anything.  So here's a quote just for you -- I won't
bother to put it in my sig, because I'd want to go right back and take it
out again -- from Rage Against the Machine.



Come on!

Yeah! Come on!

Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me
