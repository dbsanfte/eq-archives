Yes. 255 is the cap until level... 60, IIRC. From level 61-65, the cap
raises by 5 per level, for a new 65 cap of 280. Then you can purchase AA's
(Innate Enlightenment and Planar Power) to raise the cap to a max of 355.

Again, only IIRC... but Spiritual Dominion (BST spell) is more mana regen
per tick than SR?
Other than that, I can't think of other mana regen spells, not cast by
druids.
You will get the "Mask of..." line of spells starting at level 60. This will
add to your mana regen as well.. as will Protection of the Glades and
eventually Protection of the Nine.

You should be able to search for Mana Regen items now from one of the drop
down menus on the left.
Be aware though : FT/Mana Regen items are usually very expensive!

Your best bet would be to buy the components for the Earring of the Solstice
quest, for the very nice FT 1 earring. Depending on your server, you should
be able to purchase the items needed for 8-10 K, I would guess.
To read about the quest, check www.eqtraders.com or www.allakhazam.com

That would be around the only FT item you can buy for less than 20K, unless
something drastic has happened overnight!

Good luck,

Lalor
