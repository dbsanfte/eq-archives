Probably because the crash you experience was an 'effect' not the cause.
Something got screwed up with your char (probably during an autosave)
and there were *two* symptoms you noticed, one was the crash, one was
the faction. Seems the more probable explanation since, as you say, the
infomation is saved on their servers, not yours.

If faction was all saved client side, would be too easy to hack/change
it
