We have someone in our guild who is exactly the same as you (except he wont
leave cb and kelethin) I took him to oasis the other day and showed him
where to bind even told him what to kill in groups and lo next thing I knew
he had gotten a port back. you are a druid my friend a wanderer (at 51
anyway) you can bind almost anywhere you have a little less to worry about
than other classes (most wolves and bears will not attack you) so for
Tunares sake wait till eq daytime and get yourself through kithcor and head
off for new plains you are highly sought in groups at this lvl because of
your harmony spell most of the dervs cant be taken at your lvl without it.
If your that worried about finding your body bind yourself each time you go
to a new zone and bards, necro's and sk's can always find your corpse just
may have to shout for a while but there you go.
