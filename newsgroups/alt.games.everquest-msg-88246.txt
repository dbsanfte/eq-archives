You can take a lot of the guess work out of helping someone by only helping
those who yell for help. I personally believe that even if their just running to
the zone they should /yell anyway so they give at least some warning to anyone
near the zone that danger is approaching.

Unfortunately the politics of camping within EQ are rather murky and, in many
cases, conflicting. As a rule I never attack a quest specific mob that's being
camped. All others, as far as I'm concerned, are basically fair game. Though, to
be truthful, I rarely camp any spawn sites unless they have something specific I
want and I've found that most other campers will generally let you know if
they're after something specific too.
