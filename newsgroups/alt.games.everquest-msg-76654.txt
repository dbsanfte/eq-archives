Just for the record, Ampere's long message on the Pyzjn pop is either on 
the Allakhazam site or Everlore site under Pyzjn.  Page 13, I think it was 
at one time - I had it bookmarked, but that installation of Mandrake is 
long gone.

And, it is 100% accurate.  It is what I used to get my 4 GBS.  A 20+ Druid 
-is- the best for hunting Pyzjn because of the traits needed to do it 
perfectly ( Track, charm animal, SoW ).  A problem with a 20 druid is the 
even rarer Varsoon pops, though.  A 20 druid can't kill him.  They still 
need to note his death time, as he is an official placeholder.  The undying 
version that pops on his death is not, so just steer clear of him.

I didn't reread Amp's message, and didn't think he mentioned charming the 
PH.  As a Chanter, I would just charm the PH until it was time to kill it 
and then break charm.  During all the down time, I got my fishing skills 
way up and also my baking skills ( free fish rolls with the fish and the 
bats in the zone ).

The GBS is only going for 1-2k on Karana, now, so farming it -is- an option 
still, just not as lucrative of one as it used to be.  I've thought about 
going back and getting a few more, but I'm making decent cash now and 
getting fab exp in Dalnirs and Kaesora.  I just have too much fun stoff 
going on to sit though another Pyzjn.  If you are high enough, though, may 
be worth it to do both the Pyzzie camp and Hadden, if you can get his spawn 
down.  I took him down 3-4 times, maybe 5, but never got an earring.

If you aren't a tracker, learn her spawn points and when it's time for her 
or her PH to spawn, start running to them ( with a SoW from the Druid 
camping the Millers ) until you find either her or a PH.

She can spawn in and close to the ruins, so if someone else is "camping 
Pyzjn" by sitting in the Ruins, be around there first at pop time to get 
her, else troll the outlying spawn points for her first and go to the ruins 
last.

She sometimes casts her pet on spawning, sometimes walks a little first, 
and sometimes waits until she reaches the ruins.  Some claim that it has 
somthing to do with her having the GBS, but it's malarchy, as you know.  
It's just a rare loot, there or not when she spawns.

I hope that some of you high level people ( Class that can charm, 
preferably ) who want to work on fishing and baking will go camp her, get 
the GBS, and figure out the quest involved with her, it, Varsoon, and his 
Undying form.  There's gotta be one.

Charm her, then charm Varsoon, and talk to them.  I've talked to her 
before, but never got the opportunity to charm Varsoon ( was too low level 
to chance it not working and getting killed ).
