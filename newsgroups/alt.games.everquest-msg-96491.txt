Which is why I started the post mentioning it was a rumor.  Chances
are it is just some troll on the safehouse.  Still, as a 46th level
character dreading hitting the 50s, it would be nice to be able to get
to 51 quicker than if it 50 were hell.  The thought of bind wound
going to 75% and then First aid taking it to over 100...no
downtime...drooolll
