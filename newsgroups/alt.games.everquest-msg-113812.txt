5. Fishing - available for all. You won't fish your way into Ry'gorr
Battle Mail any time soon, but it doesn't require PC customers either.
6. Binding - available to pure casters. Soulbinders have reduced the need for
this a lot, but there are still many more places to bind than there are
soulbinders (HH, Arena, banks, ...).
7. Sowing - 3 classes only
8. Clarity - bards and chanters, maybe more in those exalted level 30+ areas...

Anyone make much money with Invis? Corpse Locating? Summoning Corpses?
