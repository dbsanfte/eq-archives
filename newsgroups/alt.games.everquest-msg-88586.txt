If its a "copy" of my existing chars, and comes with no reputation, then its
a heck of a lot different to me. If the "copy" leaves you unsatisfied, then
thats your problem. I play it to enjoy, not for approval.

I dont know where the bit about giving accesses to their databases came
from. I had the idea of them creating copy-characters from eq for you. I
think it would be a brilliant marketing plan... perhaps a necessary plan to
get subscribers. More subscribers=more money. If you still dont think it
will ever happen, then I guess we will jusst have to waiit and see.
