LOL yes OOC and SHOUT are not places for lizard talk, but guild chat sure
is.  and when i feel like playfully annoying my fellow elves *my guild is
mainly elves* i use dark speack so I may speak with the INKYS in the guild.
of course it is no fun to do now, considering we all know all the languages.
*sigh*.. but i admit it is hard on my lizard to speak the tongue of a smooth
tiny one.
