If the Warrior cannot keep aggro, that is a bad thing, we've established
that. However, one can only hold on so long, on multiples where the
Enchanter cannot control things it is best to establish a balance of pain.
That is where the tank-hybrids come in. SKs and Paladins cannot tank as well
as a Warrior - period, but we can draw aggro the best (Disease Cloud/Shadow
Vortex and Stun) so the tank-hybrids can relieve some stress off the Clerics
and Enchanters to buy time for Mes or heals on that Warrior.

And if you pay attention to my advice, I'm not saying that Haste items are
useless, I'm saying that it's far better for a Warrior to have more AC and
allow the Bards/Enchanters/Shaman to give him Haste. So if the Haste item
adds a tolerable amount of AC, go for it.
