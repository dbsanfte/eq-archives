Difference you mean, I assume. It does; L3-6 suck donkey boogers for
some reason. If you parse logs from then you'll find (depending on
your class and especially where you start, but still holds in general)
that L3-6 are some of the most tediously annoying in the game. It's a
byproduct of the poor availability of L3-4 mobs in many newbie areas.

L7 and 8 are also annoying, for a different reason; L7 especially for
druids, shamans, and clerics, L8 for hybrids.

None of those levels teach you anything but melee mob until dead.
There's no need for them to each take as many kills to get through as
levels in the high 20s (and they do).

And in the end the effect is still negligable. We're talking a matter
of a few hours /played time difference. Losing that time isn't going
to cripple anyone and most people aren't going to miss it.

They could have set it to L8 to be perfect, I would say, but I think
they just went for a round number. They know the actual effect in the
long run is meaningless, so why not improve the short term.
