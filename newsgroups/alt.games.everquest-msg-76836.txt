Back in the day I killed Lady Shae in West Freeport a couple of times, but
never enough to be KOS to her, the only faction that was reported to go down
was FelGuard, and I gave her red wine enough times to be amiable to her, but
I still somehow became KOS to Pandos and the sisters on the Island. How do I
make myself not KOS to them.

I went to Crushbone and spent several hours there killing them and grabbing
belts and turning them in, but I didnt even move up from scowling to
threating to Pandos. What do I need to do to fix my faction?
