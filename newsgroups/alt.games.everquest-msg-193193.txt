What is the problem here then?

Two accouts does not really mean two CD sets. If you HAD two accounts
you don't need two CD sets.

To start a new account you have to have a unique CD set. This is what
you mean but I am not sure it is what he understands. Sony was giving
out account keys for free, for second accounts, without the purchase
of a CD set.

If you have an account and want to start a second account, you buy a
new CD set. To use your existing account on a new PC you don't have to
buy anything, just have the CD to install.

I don't understand why people think the client should be free! It
costs cash to distribute and market, and costs money to start a new
account (credit checks - database - customer service - capital
investment), and they would be taking a loss if it was free.
