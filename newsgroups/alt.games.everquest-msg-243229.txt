I do sympathize, but I would also have to admit that if they were to take 
a poll right now, I would vote for graphics design parameters in line 
with the features and capabilities of today's hardware. Your graphics 
card is a couple of years old, after all. Your getting the kind of 
improvement you claim out of it before the recent changes was either very 
fortunate or with all of the new (better, IMO) models and graphics 
options turned off.

Granted, they still don't quite have it right as far as graphics 
performace and stability goes, but they've taken steps in the right 
direction. They'll fix what's wrong and we will see more awesome 
improvements like we got with the lighting and sky updates.

Also, I've seen the rat and bat models to come, and I think they are vast 
improvements. It is a fairly reliable formula: (higher quality textures) 
+ (more polygons) + (better shading) = (better graphics) as long as they 
can push it all efficiently with the engine. I am truly looking forward 
to many more improvements of that very nature.
