A lot of it is spam, vomited across a few thousand newsgroups with
complete disregard to the group's intended topic. Especially likely
if it has a line of gibberish at the end, or the Subject has a
bunch of spaces followed by several digits or letters. These
are the signatures of spam-bots who include the randomness to
sneak past the cancelbots which clean up the garbage.
