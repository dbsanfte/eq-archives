Ya know, after all this time my opinion of the average EQ player wasn't
that great, but the pethora of 12 y/o style posts this thread generated
has actually managed to lower it.  In the adult world folks expect both
themselves and others to be held to certain standards of conduct.  It is
pretty easy to tell a person's level of maturity by how they respond to
that expectation.  This post, as well as posts by some others clearly
demonstrate why on line gaming will likely never go beyond its current
level of disappointment no matter what game producers provide for our
enjoyment.  Perhaps an inclusion of permanent death combined with active
involvement by in game DMs is the answer <BEG>.  Imagine if you will....

An ominous rumbling is heard throughout the land.
Imabutthead is struck for 32,000 points of lightning damage
Imabutthead has been permanently slain.
