What Celaeno is trying to say is,

" Please accept me into the ring of bashers so that I can show off and
possibly have some friends in life."

 Jump on the band wagon my pathetic excuse for an "AGE" user. You are no
different then the rest who pounce in this thread claiming that you were
actually part of this bash fest.

You have no opinion, your quest is for attention only.

Like glass :--)

Have a Nice Day !!!!!
