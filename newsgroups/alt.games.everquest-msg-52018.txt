Try not to pay to much attention to ron, he's just being himself.  Feel free
to do a google search you'll quickly find ron is a wee-bit out of touch with
reality.

Must've been a bad day for ron green, A.K.A. bizbee.  Get caught spitting in
your customers' food again?  Get yourself fired, again, ron?  Another woman
dump, your negative, bitter, angry ass?   More bills than money, ron?  One
of your aliases get banned again ron?  What happened ron? You can tell us,
we're the closest thing to a family you've got.

ron you should try to be more positive, things would go better for you if
you could just do that simple little thing.

Ah, I don't really want you to change.  I enjoy seeing you flail like a
wounded animal too much.

Hats off to you sir!
The Infamous il128
