Funniest thing that happened to me was:-

I was stood right in the centre of the arched gateway at Qeynos, waiting for
a friend to turn up.  This lvl 3 Druid comes up to me, and without a word
invites me to join a group, I politely respond with, "Sorry friend, but I am
lvl 36 (at the time), I cannot group with you", to which he repsonds "You
suck" repeatedly, OK, who cares huh.....but then, a few mins later he comes
upto me (btw I am still in the same spot)  and says, "give me armour", is
say "LOL, thought I sucked, go away little man".....so.....he DD's me, LOL
he had barely finished casting afore the guards had put him down!, laugh...
I nearly shat!  A few mins later, said idiot turns up to collect his corpse,
and says to me, "What the *&^* did you do that for!" I answer quite honestly
"It wasn't me, it was the guards", he answers......wait fer it....."won't
*(&^*ing miss this time"......whack whack
To make matters worse, the same idiot see's me in Qeynos Hills the following
day and offers to duel me, I resisted...barely.
