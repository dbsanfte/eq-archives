I recently purchased Everquest Evolutions and found a card inside for up to
40% discount on Kingston Ram. When I looked into the deal I found that it
was useless to me as I don't live in the USA and with exchange rates and
shipping costs it was cheaper to buy the Ram locally. As a result I have a
discount card that is doing me no good.

If anyone is thinking of buying Kingston Ram and would like the discount I
will give the card number to the first one to let me know they want it. Be
warned that you have to purchase the Ram by the end of February 2004.
