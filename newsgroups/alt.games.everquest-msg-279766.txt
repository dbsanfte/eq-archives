I seem to recall "some employee from Sony posting some actual 
statistics" that claimed that the average main character was some 
"lowish" level... by lowish I mean notably below "max level" (and well 
away from what the raiders would even consider recruiting). Regrettably 
I don't have the cite. Perhaps someone bookmarked it? It caused quite a 
stir at the time. This wasn't all that long ago either.

Sure I'll grant you that. But then consider this: lets say the server 
has 1000 players on it from 8pm to midnight tonight. Now lets say a full 
50% of those people are raiders raiding the entire time, and the other 
50% represent more casual players. By 10pm fully half of the 'casual 
players' have cycled... there's still 500 of them... but 250 of are new.

Now tomorrow... same deal... 500 players raiding... and 500 casuals. But 
of the 500 'casuals', 350 of them didn't play yesterday. And at 10pm 
half of those have cycled again into completely fresh players.

I guess where I'm going with this is that in two days, my hypothetical 
server has run 50% raiders / 50% casuals the whole time. Yet... if you 
actually add everybody up, there was a total of 500 raid accounts, and 
500+ 250+ 350 + 175 = 1450 casual accounts. Nearly 2:1 in terms of 
accounts... and we've only counted Monday & Tuesday so far... by the end 
of the week its still the same 500 raiders, but we've added another few 
hundred "once/per week casuals" per day...

Anyhow... that's my "theory"... we'd need an official word from sony to 
settle it, but I don't think its terribly unrealistic. Especially in 
view of the cite I alluded to above. (Which I'm not fabricating, I swear 
:)

Interesting take on it. Given that it lured FoH, Afterlife, and so forth 
in their entirety I don't think your painting the full picture... 

Especially as I don't feel compelled to mosey on over to WoW myself. As 
far as soloable... I think the new titles have swung the pendulum to far 
the other way.

But you have a point, which you reiterate below, that perhaps EQ will be 
the island for raiders in a sea of soloable titles. Perhaps what we 
hangers on really need is a game for hard core pickup groups... what EQ 
used to be, and which the market seems to be failing to address. 
Vangaurd's going into beta though... :)

Lol. Touche.

EQ from day one was made for me too. I even kept up as it evolved into a 
raid game... but real life has thrown enough other commitments, 
obligations and chaos into my life to force me to drop out of the raid 
game.

I don't miss raiding, but i do miss the progression, the fact that the 
endgame was in sight, and reachable. I'd love a game that consisted of 
content that accepted a maximum of 4-6 people to an 'encounter' and 
really tested their limits, and then rewarded those that emerged 
victorious... you know... D&D style...
