For some reason I can no longer go into covered structures ie
dungeons, buildings etc without encountering a loud audio squeal, It
is well defined. for instance in EC at the tunnel enhance everything
is fine....go in maybe 100 feet and the squeal starts. The only thing
I can add is that I have been p;aying around with my Logitech Cordless
Mouseman Optical Mouse. If I load the Logitech drivers I can't scroll
in the chat window....With the MS drivers and the Logitech Mouse I
can. However everything worked normally in that configuration until
yesterday....thats when the problem started

I have tried downloading the complete file check in all the
expansions, I have tried, in desperation, changing screen resolution. 

Any comments?
