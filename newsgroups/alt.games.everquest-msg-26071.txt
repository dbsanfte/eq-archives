You don't even need to be traveling -- if you find a spot where
you can swim while stuck in place, you still get skill increases.
My favorite spot is in the water in East Freeport, a bit north of
the docks, where the walls meet at about a 120 degree angle.
Position yourself nose-first into the "corner", then start swimming
forever without going anywhere.

I don't think so.

Swimming along a long zone wall is really no different from
picking a large body of water (e.g. Ocean of Tears, or Timorous
Deep), aiming straight across it, and doing the same "set and forget".
