These are very interesting observations, and I haven't seen anyone else 
comment on these uses for these spell lines.  I've been experimenting 
with them and with the PBAE stuns, since my cleric found -his- stuns to 
be highly useful tools, but chanter stuns seem to work radically 
differently, and figuring out the differences and the proper 
applications for them has been a hit and miss adventure thus far.  I 
must say I now have a lot more respect for cleric stuns, particularly 
"stun" and "stun command" (the no dd stuns), I certainly miss fixed 
duration targetable stuns that don't break no matter what you do.

Chanter stuns are as remarkable in their own ways, but the differences 
between the two (three, since PB AE stuns and the Whirl line are 
themselves radically different from each other) are also remarkable.

I've found the same to be true of every class I've played, the average 
player uses perhaps a third of the spell list and performs the 
traditional, expected roles, while the good player uses the whole list 
and does a wide variety of things when appropriate (and the bad player 
uses anywhere from none to all of the list, but -not- when appropriate!)
