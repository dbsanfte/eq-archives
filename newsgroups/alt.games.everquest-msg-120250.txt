Why are you wrong when you say "This is a Beast Lord and
Enchanter upgrade more than a Mage or Necromancer
upgrade."?

/boggle

Why would you think it's not for mages?   They're the pet class
that will probably benefit the most from the change, especially
epic mages.

And, no, the end game has nothing to do with solo play.  That's
kinda what I meant by "a level 60 necro/mage/whatever killing
for XP/AAXP isn't playing the 'end game.'"
