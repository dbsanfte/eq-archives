LOL yeah. Already working on the AC thing, was just curious. Didn't think it
was all that good about getting cripples. Just weird not seeing it from me
(48 Warrior) and seeing it happen to lower warriors quite often. I wouldnt
trade my ac for anything! lol. As far as killing things- hell yeah, just...
bored... need a new place to level besides LGuk, Dreadlands, etc. Been to
Rathe Mountains too much, but loot/exp isnt bad. As for bazaar? Don't have
it so I cant fart around there.
