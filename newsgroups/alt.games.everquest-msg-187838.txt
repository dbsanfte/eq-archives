At your level there's basically 2 ways.
(1) Know *which* MOBs to kill. Some low-level MOBs have drops worth
    reasonable amounts of plat. Plague rat tails are worth about 1
    plat each, for example. Certain kinds of rats drop them.
(2) Collect trivial stuff that is worth cash to tradeskillers. Misty
    Acorns from Misty Thicket; spiderling and spider silks. Make
    leather paddings (combine 2 spiderling silks in a tailoring kit,
    then combine with a low-quality animal pelt) - these sell for
    around 20 plat each.
(3) Other desirable items - bone chips for necros, or for people trying
    to build Cabilis faction in the Field of Bone.

Basically most MOBs that you can handle don't drop a lot of loot, so
your best bet is probably the player economy.
