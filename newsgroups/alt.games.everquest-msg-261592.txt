Agreed. I mentioned it to illustrate the point that the people are 
pleased with what they can loot; for the breif period of time that its 
all they can get.

Agreed on that one too.

I think a gradual addition of reccommended/restricted/ tags to all gear 
isn't a bad idea. (give the players warnings about whats coming so they

Not sure. Expendable Utility commodities (potions, charged items)?...

Maybe, but I doubt the truly bleeding edge see a lot of droppable

The value to a molasses economomy is that it rewards the people who -do- 
want to be traders; allows them to be traders. And lets the regular 
player get on with leveling and looting the majority of his stuff.

Consider EQ pre-bazaar when you had to take your character into nfp or 
ec to wheel and deal. In the amount of time it took to find and buy your 
upgrade you could earn something. Take pp out of the system and it slows 
the economic process even more. The people who want to be traders will 
be in more demand, taking orders, watching fluctuating commodity prices 
and haggling deals... while the rest of the playerbase can play the 
'main game'.

You can't bar weirdness; the weirdness is real. Farming FS at 30 is the 
same profit as farming silks at 5. *Everyone* is buying 55th level 
drops. There is a bit of a progression as the 55th level players are 
buying 65th level drops. But its a two step, not a 'every 10 levels 
step' which implies 7 steps.

And that doesn't factor in the tradeskilled items you need a 300 to 
craft but can buy for a pittance because the tradeskiller is happily 
eating a loss to at least partially fund advances.

I think if the spread is 50 levels in a 70 level game it is an important 
factor that can't be glossed over as a detail. 10th level players are 
not buying 30th level drops by and large; given the price of 
wurmslayer...and the ease of accumulating the few hundred pp required to 
buy it.

Attunable is a step in the right direction. It will seriously deflate 
the value of attunable gear though. Would you buy a 75k X to use for 10 
levels until you get something better...if you know that you won't be 
able to sell it for a lousy copper when you are done with it?

Perhaps droppable gear should degrade over time while no drop gear 
doesnt?? And degrade faster the lower level you are??

As a retrofit; yeah its a bear. But its a better solution even so.

Recommended level gear shouldn't be superior to level appropriate gear. 
Ie ... a FS weapon should be better than a level 65 reccommended level 
item... on a 15th level character.

Quite the reverse; I think they'll make 'affordable uber items'. A fungi 
tunic is x kpp... and attunable version of that item would be a quarter 
that or less...

As convenient as that is I don't think anyone *really* likes it that 
way. Its decidely unheroic. If they added fish to the game that were 
worth a lot of pp, and you could make more money fishing than farming 
crappy loot it would be an even easier and more efficient way to earn 
pp.  People would all be pretty excited... but would anyone *really* 
want to play that game though? On some level you'd have to ask why they 
even need gear upgrades if they're just going to spend all their time 
fishing. :)

I don't like the TLC. It is too restrictive especially in EQ where you 
need so many green kills to perform quests.

I do think drop rates should be factored by time and or level, not just 
mob instancing though. This would allow them to make a rare drop 'rare' 
for the 45ths without making it common for the 65ths. (ie a 45th can 
kill 20 mobs per hour and needs to kill 200 mobs on average to get the 
drop...making it a 10 hour camp... while a 65th can slaughter the entire 
zone in 5 minutes flat and get the drop in under an hour, or in the same 
10 hours pull out 10 of them.
