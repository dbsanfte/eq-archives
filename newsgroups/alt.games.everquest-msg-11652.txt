Rangers don't make a great tank. Remember a tank is something that can take a
beating. Ranger is a good class, but if you really want to be a tank choose
another class.

Rangers can solo fairly well using a combination of melee, magic, and bow.

Rangers are valuable to a group as a 2nd or 3rd tank or if they need a
snarer/SOWer/harmonizer.
