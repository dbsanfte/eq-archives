I will ask in a polite and full sentece way, not like "key d00d"
if they agree fine if not well then i will have to wait.

If it is so that invis drops, to bad you get no indication on it, i
have no problem with the fact that it does but i would like some
message in the log, like "you are no longer invisible or something
like that"

Ahh so that is what it men't on my map over sirens grotto, so there is
no way to cross without that teleport thing? to bad but hey getting
that far is not bad after all :)

main necro)
