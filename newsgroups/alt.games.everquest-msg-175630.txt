Now this makes sense from a RP perspective..."Fallen Paladin".

On the other hand it doesn't discourage "ebayers", because the real
trick is to be FS character/account.

If it is based on faction/action, it will make for excellent RPing.

I hate to keep pointing out the "half-empty" glass....but.....

It is a given that a LOT of players will want to be Jedi's....It has
been stated by the developers that only a small number will achieve
it. Now imagine the jealousy and hate that will be the motivating
force (pun intended :-P) behind "Jedi-Hunting". I am begining to think
that the "prestige" class in SWG might turn out to be the "pariah"
class.

The more I "argue" with you, the more interesting SWG sounds hehe.
