Didn't you know that Tox has been fixed?  Of course not, who would bother
going there to find out.  Anyway I was there a few weeks ago helping a
friend who started a new Erudite Necro and the zone has been revamped and is
now a great newbie area.  I think with these changes Paineel/Tox is now one
of the BEST newbie areas in the game.  Levels 1-4 are a piece of cake in the
little newbie area outside of the entrance to The Hole and The Warrens.  4+
is now just as easy in Tox.  They have added lots of snakes, spiders,
skeletons and a few of these new baby Spectre looking things.

They have also added newbie armor quests for necros. You could now easily
level to 10th level in Tox then go to The Warrens to 20, then to Stonebrunt
and if you really wanted too,  level all the way to 45 without ever setting
foot on the mainland.

Another benefit to Tox is that you are near a spire which makes getting to
and from the Nexus much easier.  This pretty much takes care of the KOS
problem. It also means that as you level getting back to Paineel to pick up
new spells is much easier.
