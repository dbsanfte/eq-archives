You are quite wrong there.  It is easy soloing from about level 8 on up 
to 23 or higher.  The trick is to enter Paludal from the Hollowshade Moor 
(or is it Shadeweavers, anyway, the one that the Shar Vahl book dumps you 
in from PoK) side, not Shadowhaven.  Then move in until mobs are dark 
blue to yellow to you, and have at it.  My druid went in at level 14, 
emerged at level 23.  My enchanter did the same from level 12 to level 
23, and my ranger did it from 12 to 15 so far.
