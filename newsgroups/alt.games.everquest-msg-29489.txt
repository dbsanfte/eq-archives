And actually, I find that Shamans have no trouble finding groups either
generally.  Personally, I group with any and all classes.  I don't try to
find the optimal set of classes for a group.  I enjoy playing, meeting
people, seeing what other classes can do.  I have a couple of friends who
play wizards, one level 53, one level 32.  Both have noticed that if it
weren't for friends/guild they would have a really tough time finding
groups.  In the end though, you have to make a decision based on how you
like to play.  If spending a lot of time soloing with significant downtime
in between is not for you, then a Wizard is probably not the best choice of
classes.  I find that I probably split my time half and half between soloing
and grouping.  I can still effectively solo both of my main characters, but
with a lot of downtime between mobs.
