Doing a wizard necro duo, we did three levels in the boss caves in no time
at all and made some nice money, but they were so easy I was usually 
falling asleep while we killed them. I solo'd in that cave regularly, 
though the downtime was worse because I was using a lot of stuns. Their 
MR is a joke. Snare, root, stun - nuke - stun. Rinse and repeat. Those 
were seriously the easiest xp mobs I found anywhere in my fifties.
