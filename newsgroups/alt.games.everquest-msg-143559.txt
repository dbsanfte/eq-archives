I didn't say it hurt the game.  I was responding to what seemed to be an
implication that a time/mana saver was not an item with major impact.

However, I'll play Devil's Advocate in this post, and try to give some
reasons why Verant might think too many Cleric epics might hurt the game.
(Then, at the end, I'll shoot them all down by pointing out something that I
think Verant overlooked).

Note that from Verant's point of view, spending more time playing is not
necessarily a good thing.  Verant makes the same money from the once-a-week
player as they do from the lives-everquest player, and they can support a
lot more of the once-a-week players on the same number of servers.

Verant has a certain pace they want the game played at.  My guild was not
prevented from raiding before one of our Clerics got his epic.  However, it
meant we did, say, Chardok, instead of Temple of Veeshan, while encouraging
people to level up a bit so we could start ToV.  The epic boosts our raiding
power, so we can do things that are a bit harder.

If the Cleric epic were truly common, it might also start affecting ordinary
XP groups, too.  It can be hard now to get a res in many XP areas, because
the Clerics there are in XP groups, and don't want to take the time to res
people not in their group.  With epics common, we might see it become much
easier to get a res.  From a player's point of view, that is great...but
from Verant's point of view, it would make people level faster, and they
want people leveling at a certain rate.

However, epics were also supposed to be uncommon.  They probably all should
have been more like the Mage epic.  The big design problem with the Cleric
epic is that it is so useful for a guild to have epic Clerics, that the
guild will drop everything to help.  Compare to, say, the Wizard epic.  I'd
love a Wizard epic, but unless it is combined with some other high end stuff
that I have no chance of getting, it doesn't make me massively more useful
to my guild, so "/gu phinny is up...anyone want to come help me get a shot
at his staff?" is not going to get an OMG-mobilize-the-guild response like
"/gu ragefire NOW!" will...there aren't going to be 20 people bound in Kedge
waiting for Phinny. :-)

What I think Verant overlooked was that Cleric epics generally don't leave
the game.  Every epic Cleric I've seen who has retired has passed their
account on to their guild or to a friend.  This means that the percentage of
epic Clerics is going up, and will keep going up--limiting the rate they
come in is not going to stop each server from approaching epic saturation.

It will be interesting to see if future games learn from this.  Putting
fantastic items in a game, and not including some mechanism to make those
items leave the game (such as item decay), is bad.
