Stamina does two things for you. It gives you a bit more hitpoints, 
which adds up at higher levels.
If your stamina goes over 100, you don't suffer any penalties (other 
than inability to jump) when you are fatigued. That usually doesn't 
happen until later levels when you can afford a heavy weapon.
I went with stamina mainly when creating my monk -- seeing that I had 
plenty of agility to start with, dexterity being total waste, and 
strength having a very minor effect. So far I didn't regret it, but one 
way or the other it should not be a big deal
And yes, there are very few stamina items.
