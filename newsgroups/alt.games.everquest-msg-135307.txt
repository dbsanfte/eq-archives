Thats what I was thinking on a smaller level.

Say you are Chinga_2 Go buy the one for 200 and the one for 50
Now you know that your 250 is eaqual lowest price and more likely to
sell.
Once you have sold all 3 you make a bonus 250.

Not something that the average player will do, but there are trade
specialists out there.
I would guess that some people will be cornering markets quite swiftly.
I was thinking of trade skills supplies, but it works even better in a
small uber market as there are less things to buy.

If a top end guild had a couple of people to corner the market on xxx
they could end up making a tidy wedge. However I would guess for real
top end guilds this would be pointless as the could make more killing.

Humm,

I guess that we wait and see.
