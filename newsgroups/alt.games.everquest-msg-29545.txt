Let's say I'm less than happy with the surname chosen for my female
ranger. If I marry somebody 20+ who does NOT have a surname would that
be a loophole to get mine removed? :)

Just checking. Barring that I'll just have a friend of mine get a
better surname for his 30 warrior that he doesn't use and marry 'im.

Scott
