Hail,


Yes, you did hear me correctly.  Apparently there is now a quest for
Ghoulbane for all those Paladins who don't want to murder one of their own
class to get it.  The 'In Development' section of the official everquest
site says:

"We on the EverQuest Team realize that with all the factions, plots, and
quests in Norrath we end up with a few oversights that just don't make sense
in the overall story of the world. And so, for the sake of being true to our
world, we've decided to keep an eye out specifically for these things and
make changes where necessary. The fact that you now have the option to quest
for your Ghoulbane from a froglok paladin rather than just brutally
murdering the poor chap is just one example of these changes with many more
to come."

So now, good knights, where do we start, that is the next question.

Lvl 18 Paladin who now thinks getting a Ghoulbane might not be so bad after
all.
