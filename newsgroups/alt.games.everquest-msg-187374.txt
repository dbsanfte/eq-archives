One problem with the written medium is it's hard to convey tone,
people tend to assume. Quite often I come across in writing as being
all bent out of shape over something when I'm really simply annoyed.
In the case of the person in question, mildly amused at the same time.
I really don't get bent out of shape that often...except when
someone's going out of their way to pick at me over something stupid.
