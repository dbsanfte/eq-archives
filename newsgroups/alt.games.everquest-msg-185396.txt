My trader has been known to crash to desktop for the past week or to drop to
the server select screen as well.  My attempts to fix the problem have been:

1. turn clip plane down as low as possible - no change
2. crouch - nada
3.stand in the front of the stall - no difference
4. stand in the back of the stall - no difference
5. turn off all spell effects - no change

This morning, after having done all these things in order to keep my trader
online had failed I decided to try and filter *everything else*.   I
filtered OOC, shout, say, guild, etc.  Everything is filtered.

I checked my trader when I got home today and he is still standing there
with no spam in his chat window at all except that he is saved over and
over.  I don't know how much less bandwidth I could hope to get than that!
And it works!  He has survived the day with this.

To keep something like this a secret would be ludicrous.  If SOE wants to
reduce bandwidth costs by dropping traders, they should just tell us to use
the least amount of bandwidth we possibly can and how to do it.  This isn't
rocket science, however it may not be very obvious to a lot of players how
to fix.

As a side note:  I will have to check his log file size to see if maybe that
was part of the culprit as well with the crashes.  If you are logging by
default on your trader there may be a file size issue there that is causing
crashes, although that is not confirmed.  For now, I will just filter as
much text as possible.
