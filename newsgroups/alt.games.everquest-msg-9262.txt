Just curious. Grammar in general seems to be a big sticking point with you.
Was English your major in College, and/or do you write for a living?

I do prefer not to abbreviate certain things, and spelling is a pet peev,
but not as much as it seems to you. This isn't meant as a rant, just curious
as to your history with English Grammar.
