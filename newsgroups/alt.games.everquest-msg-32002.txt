I'm not 100% on this, but in our guild we have 2 clerics that (like
the few you describe) allways manage to make it out. They are doing a
few things different. Number 1 they manage aggro like total experts,
when they see a bad pull comming they don't jump up and start healing,
leaping to the top of the aggro list. Number 2 they have a camp hotkey
and aren't afraid to start the camp and watch.

This is all made possible by  OTHER clerics keeping the raid pumping
long enough for them to camp, often they are 20sec into /camp before
its called. Add to this smart monks and SK's that FD the instant
things look bad and take stock of the situation etc, and the whole
process is much simplified. I can't remember the last wipeout we had
that wasnt rezzable in some form or another.

Just my 2cp.
