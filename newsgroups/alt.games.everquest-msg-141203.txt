Yes, you have the numbers right. Suggestion - buy your memory from
www.mushkin.com. I bought some from another vendor recently and ended
up returning it, as it wasn't stable at 333. Mushkin sells some that's
rated even higher than 333 for just a few $$$ more, which I recommend.

The SBLive  card either works great or crappy, depending on apparently
random unknown criteria. If your new Asus MB has on-board sound, you
might want to at least try it first before you drop cash on the
SBLive. The on-board sound on my new Gigabyte motherboard gives me
good EQ sound for the first time in two years.

This system is plenty adequate for all but the most intensive zones.
So, it'll bog a bit in the bazaar, but there isn't a computer made
that won't take a hit there.

Another suggestion I would make based on my recent upgrade
experience... get a low noise CPU cooler. The one that will come with
your system will be the cheapest possible model, and so will be noisy.
I replaced mine with this model for $34, and it's wonderful...

I bought it through www.tcwo.com

You might also want to replace any case fans with quiet ball bearing
fans. Very much worth the expense!
