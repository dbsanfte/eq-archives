Fair enough...I did misinterpret what you said. :)

During combat, yes. But the world isn't about JUST combat.  EQ2 is
attempting to be not-quite-such-a-hack-n-slash game (I'm dubious at
whether that will succeed, but...that's another conversation), so in
theory there is still plenty of social interaction that is in no way
limited.

Do you consider traffic laws to be the arm of Big Brother?  I want to know
if you acknowledge that the line between laws that are beneficial at the
price of small freedoms and those that are beneficial at the price of
unacceptable freedoms is a very hazy line.

I'm prepared to just leave this one at "Ben doesn't like locked encounters
and Foxeye does", but if you are going to make it sound like this makes
me, or the group I belong to, the kind of sheep who would embrace the
patriot act and whatever other bullshit one uses such terms as "big
brother" to, then that's just pissy.
