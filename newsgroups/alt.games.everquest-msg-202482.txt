Nothing to do with server congestion.

In old days there was a monitor that would show the repop status of all
servers but they stopped it from working. The servers would go down, patch
and then start to come back up. The old monitor had a bar which would fill
up as each server became live. SoEs page reflects that the server is
switched back on and no its repop status. The login server remains down
until all servers are respawned, checked by SoE staff and found to be
working. The login server is made online.
