No first-person view = trash game.
How can companies be bothered to create such a wonderful game, and make the
biggest design flaw of all and not add first-person view. Neverwinter
Knights will also be making the same mistake when it gets released.
Software Companies seem to forget that by adding first personview, they open
the game up for about 1 million new customers...
