Not meaning to take up a banner here but the obvious responce is:

So they mean us to tackle mobs that are impossible to solo, hit for
way over the con, and have hit points a demi-god would be proud of? 

What if we find the occasional mob the gives high rewards vs low
risks, that is extremely rare in this game. Common is high risks with
low rewards or worse. Come a on little balence is needed here. 

And valid complaints are not whines, if the mobs were too strong think
they would nerf them some? Nope nadda aint no freakin way. Games full
of those buggers. You can find them in zones that are dam near empty
at camps no one will touch a second time ). UNLESS it has an epic tied
to it but thats another story :).
