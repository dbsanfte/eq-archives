Same with Lords of Everquest beta which they threw in my face,
despite knowing I also live in the UK.

Nothing bugs me more than spam saying "HEY you, you must want this,
you should enter this, win this, I will guarentee you the other.. oh
only if you live in some other country hahaha" ..

I wrote to 3com about their palm pilot stuff which didnt till AFTER
you got through the stuff say US only - same with the lords of
everquest beta which let you apply and then wanted a delvery address
but could be US only ..

Im sorry I thought it was a WORLD wide web..
