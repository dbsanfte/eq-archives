From the shadows, the mysterious MV <nospam@nospam.com> (if that IS
his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>> What's your current character?
>
>I am now a level 2 Erudite shadowknight on Firiona Vie.
>
>I kid you not.
>
>Go ahead and laugh.  I am trying not to cry, myself.

>My name is Stormarus, for whoever sees me on-line tomorrow.

First thing you do when you log in tomorrow:

/autojoin serverwide.age:age
/1 hello

Then everyone in that channel, composed mostly of people from here,
will see you online tomorrow, and you'll understand the pull of EQ to
keeping people for years. You can listen to Vsove complain about
everyone around him, Jiji badmouth all the other guilds on her server,
Meemers link the newest loot his guild has let rot in Time, endless
suggestions of "Train him!" from Briarly, Teapray responding to
messages sent half an hour earlier, random ranger mumblings from
Meerina, even victory celebrations by Monual in realtime rather than
just reading them here.

There's usually between a dozen and just over twenty people in there
at any given time. There's stretches where no one is saying anything,
of course, but there's a decent amount of chatter for a smaller
serverwide.
