Put it all in STA.  In the long run, you'll want to max out STA, while getting
just a few points more gear in agi and dex won't be anywhere near as
hard to do.

If you are going to go untwinked, your skills will indeed suffer for a while,
till you get ahold of a few stat increasing items.  However, since you know
you have that particular hole in your gear, you can make a point of
looking specifically to fill that.

You'll spend a few weeks under 20 at best, while (assuming you go
all the way) you'll be looking at months to reach 50 and months more
to reach 60... then there's AA and endgame fun and POP coming out
shortly to raise the bar up to 65.  The slightly tougher time you had
getting your skills up before getting a little more dex won't come close
to the easier time you'll have with all those extra HP from the higher STA.

At the highest end of the game, of course, you'll have a STA at the cap,
and won't have any real advantage over the rest of the "at cap" warriors
out there... but that still gives you roughly 40 good hard levels worth
of lording it over the DE warriors and their pathetically low HP totals.
Your ability to absorb lots and lots of damage is the only thing that really
sets a tank class apart, so make the most of it.
