I can accept "Wild cat" as an adjective and noun pairing.  Is it a phrase by
itself? No.
Is "she's (like) a wild cat"?  Yes.  There is comparison there, there is
meaning there.

But since "kitty" is a Synonym for cat already (sorry but I do accept the
Dictionary as a valid tool
to define words, call me whacky or old-fashioned), I can't see how "Kitty
Kat" is in any way a phrase
by itself.
