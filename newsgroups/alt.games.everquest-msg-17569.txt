...until you are one of them.

Your station password, which gets you into EQ, also gets you into the My 
Account webpage at station.sony.com. Kludging crack or some other brute-
force cracker to run over HTTP would be trivial with Expect, Perl, or a 
number of other scripting languages. Then it's just a matter of finding 
someone elses box to run it on(not a hard proposition, given the lack of 
proper patching on most beoples Linux boxes, etc) and have it email the 
results to a hotmail account or something.
