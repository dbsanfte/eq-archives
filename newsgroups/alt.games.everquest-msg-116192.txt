OOkay.  I've been defending MS here, but, "easy to install"?  I'm
attempting to get and MCSE cert, since I'm too lazy to get and
actually DEGREE in anything, and large portions of at least THREE of
the tests are just about installing the damned products.  Granted
these are large scale installation situations, but still, even the
basic installation process is enough to make a true computer novice
(like my parents for instance) run away screaming.  And I mean that
almost literally.

I appreciate that there is a lot that MS is trying to deal with having
it's OS's install on damned near every PC type imaginable, but it
seems to me that the process could be made much, much simpler.
