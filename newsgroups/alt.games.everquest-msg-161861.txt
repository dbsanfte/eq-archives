Right, however, like the bellow song, the lvl 20 and 32 clarity songs are one-shots that fire
as soon as the casting time is up, so they can be pulsed about
every 3.5 seconds for faster mana regen.  Cantata of Soothing cannot be pulsed, because
it's not a one-shot song.  The other post has the best mana twist... amp cantata clarity clarity clarity
cantata clarity clarity clarity repeat.  But that's a lot of carpal and bards do deserve breaks
once in a while.
