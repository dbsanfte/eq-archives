You mean that powergamers can always get things done sooner.  The point is
that in SWG anything a powergamer can do, a casual player can also do.  For
example, in EQ there are some places casual players just can't go and some
item casual players just can't get, because to go to those places and to get
those items you need a big raiding guild.  Casual players can't get into a
big raiding guild because the guild expects them to be there for raids.
Which they won't be if they only play a few hours a week.  In SWG a casual
player can do anything a powergamer can do, though it'll take longer.

That's not random.  It's something you can figure out if you're smart
enough.  It's not a matter of "getting lucky".  As a matter of fact, any
player who relied on getting lucky to hit his personal combination out of
100 quadrillion would never, ever become a Jedi.  The odds would be so far
against him that he could play for 100 years and still never happen on the
combination.

Not really.  The quests already exist in-game.  It's just a matter of taking
Quest #1 out of the set and inserting Quest #51.  They're already there, all
they have to do is switch them out.  Possibly it wouldn't be worth it to
change clues, but changing quests would be quite simple.

Again, you're married to the misconception that "my char is good if he can
whupass, bad if he can't!"  SWG is not centered around combat like EQ is.
Get that through your head.  I imagine a lot of people won't play SWG just
because they prefer a purely combat-oriented MMORPG.  And that's fine.
Those people will not play SWG.  Actually Jedi and bounty hunters are the
only professions that are mostly combat-oriented.  And bounty hunters are
more assassins than fighters.  So it makes a lot of sense that absolutely
nobody could stand up to a Jedi in 1-on-1 combat.

See above.

Ah.  A preconceived notion!  Hate those things, don't you?  Well, I suppose
we'll have to feed it SWG when the game comes out and see if it dies.

Well, we'll feed SWG to that one too, how about it?

Why would a griefer want to *sell* a Jedi account??  A Jedi is the best
possible way to grief people (assuming you can do it without losing Jedi
status of course).  A player who can kill anybody one-on-one?  Hell, I've
met a lot of EQ players who would think they were in heaven -- and ruin
everyone else's day for the sheer joy of it, of course.  Ain't that what
griefers do?
