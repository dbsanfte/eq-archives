Banded is used for questing shaman armor.  There may be players that
still want to quest this armor.  

If someone is brand new to the game, they look at the outrageous
prices in the merchant shops for armor and weapons and are saving
every copper. They may not have the bazaar.  I never dreamed when
someone gave me a fine steel sword (priced at 65 platinum from npc
merchants) that what they were giving me was only a 6 platinum piece
weapon.  Check the newbie yards now and again, then unload.
