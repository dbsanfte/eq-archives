My main is a 34 bard.  I've been doing a little reading on EQDIVA but can't 
seem to find a definitive answer.

Does Largo's Melodic Binding (slow), stack with Selo's Constant Chain 
(slow, snare)?

Should I even be using these?  Here is what I want to twist while in a 
group with other tanks:

Amplification
Anthem de Arms
Largo's Melodic Binding 
Selo's Constant Chain

I figured this would give the most haste advantage to the tanks.

Otherwise, at 34, what should I be twisting?  Assuming I'm the MA?

M
