So you want to be level 60 and raid (not worry about exp grinding)?

Well news flash, if you don't level the character up how the fuck do you
know how to play them properly, let alone raid effectively.

Raids where you wipe are usually a lot more dull than exp grinds..
especially if its repeated wipes.  How can somebody be a competent level 60
raider when they probably never played a character past level 20

It doesnt need to take years to level a character to 60.

If EQ is too slow or tedious for you, go play Quake2 or something that suits
you more.

opportunity? lol.  hi this is a GAME.  the point of the game is to have FUN
building up your character to more powerful levels.

im pretty sure EQ would lose a LOT of established long term members if they
let any noob and fucktard buy level 60 characters.  heck if theres no
leveling of the characters what the fucks the point playing

Buying a character is a style of play?  lol k :)
