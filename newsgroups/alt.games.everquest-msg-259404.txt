I do find it to be true.  The mobs have more hp, but, I produce more DPS 
as well to make up for that.  I still regularly get the high con bonus 
when I am soloing.  I primarilly solo in BoT, HoH, Tactics, and PoV 
(Inner cave is nice).  I can kill about the same number of mobs per hour, 
with about 3x the xp per mob.  Maybe for a BL that's different, don't 
know.  Heck, I can go kill the same, still dark blue, mobs in PoN at 
level 65 that I did at level 58, and kill them much faster now, and more 
than make up for the high con bonus that I lose as a result.
