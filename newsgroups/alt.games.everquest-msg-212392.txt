First off, you don't know for certain that he will fall.  Secondly, you 
don't know with certainty what choice he will make.  Most importantly, 
you did not create him with full knowledge ahead of time that he would 
make said choice.  It's only free will if you really and truly do have a 
choice, if you are created to take a certain path, you are not choosing, 
you just think you are.
