Prexus is a mature server, so some of what my experiences have been
may not reflect the environments of other servers.

There has been some discussion about what constitutes a mid level
player, based on Prexus, the general consensus seems to be as follows:

1-40ish - Newbie/lowbie (some say 1-35 is lowbie and 36-50 is mid and
so on...)
45-54 - Mid level
55-59 - High Level
60 - Too busy to describe, I have a raid then need more for my shawl,
then...

My mains on prexus are a 52 monk and a 54 ranger, so while I have
gotten to participate in some of the "high-level" raids (I am
fortunate to be in a strong raiding guild), the end-game is still a
bit away at this moment.

From my ranger's perspective, I have observed the following changes in
game play:

1-30 - I WAS the tank.. 
31-40 - Lost my taunt button, started taking a backseat to warriors
and monks
40-50 - Died alot
51-54 - Generally assigned to Melee Group 2, moving in after MA group
calls.. certain raids my job is to tag off the monk, back up and pump
arrows while the other melee's close in. Jolt baby jolt.

My monk tends to be puller in groups/raids 55+ in spite of his low
level.. must be my sterling reputation.. wait.. I don't have a...
nevermind..

1-30 - Same as a warrior, except for FD
31-45 - Pulling party, tanks as good as a warrior IMHO
45-50 - Let the warrior or pally tank.. where'd all my hp's go?
51+ - Long, slow dangerous pulls... hey warrior, you tagging this
thing or what?
Need speed, SOE going!  

Now the funny thing is that I twinked out a DEF NEC and zipped him
from Paludal to LOIO to grab some words before returning to the moon. 
As soon as i ran to LOIO, my guild asked my to help out in Scarlet
Desert, so off I went, camping the necro.

Scarlet Desert:  (OOC shout, hey dip_____ watch where you pull the
mobs, player02 is a KS'r, Can someone rez me?  Where's your corpse? 
Oh, any necros or bards around?)  In other words, the same old crap
even in a 45-52ish zone.

LOIO: (OOC shout, hey dip_____ watch where you pull the mobs, player02
is a KS'r, Can someone rez me?  I lost my corpse?  trading 312 copper
for a sow!)
