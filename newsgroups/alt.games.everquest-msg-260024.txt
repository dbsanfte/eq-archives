This post is a breath of fresh air.  You have real world experience
with a similar mechanic and found it works well with certain groups of
people and doesn't work well with certain other groups of people.

Please correct me if my understanding is incorrect.

What's interesting is that you've experienced problems mostly with
English speakers, but in EverQuest (which is also mostly English
speakers), the players themselves have formed a kind of cooperative
agreement which most people tend to agree works well enough.

It almost sounds as if the game mechanic itself won't make a
difference: it's all up to the caliber of people that end up playing.

This begs the question: WHY does EverQuest seem to have the more
courteous players?  It sounds like Japanese players did just fine with
the "ping it first, it's yours" mechanic.  So apparently, that game
mechanic itself can't be entirely to blame...
