You made it sound like we don't mind the down time.  I don't know about you,
but I do mind it...but I'm getting of the age where the phrase "don't sweat
the small stuff" starts making more sense.  "Choose your battles" being
along the same lines.

"Crap, typical Verant stupidity, the servers are down again...what a
shocker."  That was my response.  Then I got over it.  After all, what
choice do I have?  I can be a baby and vent about it to people who really
don't give a crap about my opinion or I get over it.  I could quit the game
"for the principle of the thing," but that would be just as stupid as
venting to people who don't give a crap about my opinion...after all, Verant
wouldn't miss me a bit, but I sure would miss the game.
