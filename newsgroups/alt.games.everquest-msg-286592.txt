Find the UI.ini file in your Everquest folder that relates to that
character on that server and either rename or delete it.  It should
look something like.

D:\Sony Online Entertainment\EverQuest
UI_YourBeastlord_firiona.ini

If that doesn't fix it try the other .ini files relating to that
character.
