AFAIK there are no Wizzy spells to port up to Nexus either.  The Nexus port
spells only work while you are on the moon.  There are items that give you a
self port to Nexus, even for nonporting classes.  Some people also got an
item from GM events shortly before the release of SoL with the effect of
port to Nexus, don't know if group or self only off hand.
