I would really like to get hold of the elaborate scimitar and have done as
much as I can alone on my druid epic: foraged most of the stuff, killed a
few of the tainted and corrupted mobs, in the process of raising the
factions I need to raise and done the trades etc up to the east karana part.
2 things first is while looking around ek today I found athele but couldn't
find the other NPC's I have to trade with do they only spawn when you start
the trades? second is there 5 willing volunteers who would help me get the
tomb from the corrupter? ideally would like a chanter or 2 who would mez the
reavers to keep them out of trouble a couple of tank types and a cleric just
in case. I would ask my guild but we are too new to have players that high.
I am on ayonae ro server and on bst.
I am  42 druid BTW which I know is early to be thinking about this part of
the quest but would like to give it a go.
TIA
