The best one was running thru South Karana,  I think not long after
Kunark was released.  Guy does a tell to me for a port to Dreadlands.
I'm kind of busy, but I figure if he'll make it worth my while, sure,
so I tell him 20pp.  He starts arguing with me that "the price for a
port is always 10pp".  Apparently he was confusing me with a public
transportation service.  It was at about that time that I formulated
my "one strike and you're ignored" policy.
