I love it how people are always like "Warriors require zero skill to play", and
"Warriors are dumb", etc., etc., and yet at the same time when a Paladin or SK
responds to their shout for a Tank, they respond "Sorry, looking for a
Warrior".  I personally think these people should lighten up a bit, since
they're so picky about having ONLY Warriors as their tanks...

Warriors are getting less and less popular in high levels now, too.
