Considering that the only party that's had a lock on all 3 ( excluding
the last 2 years) since 1952 has been the dems, I can see your point.
The last thing we ever needed was those idiots running amok.

the budget news too, but I only watch Fox which is of course a known
member of the great conservative conspiracy right Hillary?
