** Planes of Power Zone Progression **

As most know, progressing through Planes of Power zones requires that
certain tasks be performed.  In many cases, one of the tasks required
involves being on a raid that defeats a particularly powerful foe.

One side effect of this progress is that if the tasks were not accomplished
in a particular order, a person on a raid may not gain the flag for
completing the event, as they did not complete the prerequisite tasks.

The majority of "zone boss" style encounters in the first three tiers of
Planes of Power zones have been changed to allieviate this problem of
completing tasks out of order.

As of today, if you defeat one of these foes and do not have all of the
prerequisites completed to receive the flag at the end of the event, you
will be able to go back and complete the tasks that you have not yet
performed.

Once you've done that, you may speak with the Seer in the Plane of Knowledge
who will make sure that you are then able to progress as if you had
performed the tasks in their proper order.
