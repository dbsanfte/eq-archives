When the warrior is down to less than one half health, the pally
should root the giant and both back off while the pally heals the
warrior with the rest of his mana.  Then the warrior continues to
tank while the pally hits from behind keeping his LOH ready for
when the warrior needs healing again.  The pally should always
hold back enough mana to root the giant one last time just before
running for the zone if it becomes clear you're not going to kill
him.  Of course the pally should buff the warrior and himself
before the fight starts and med back up to full mana before
beginning.
