I just got EQ Platinum for Christmas.  I used to play EQ classic about
1.5 years ago. I had one expansion for it but I don't recall which. 

 

But anyway now I just signed up for a new acct with EQ platinum.
Platinum has EQ Classic, Ruins of Kunark, Scars of Velious, Shadows of
Luclin, Planes of Power, Legacy of Ykesha, Gates of Discord and Lost
Dungeons of Norrath.

 

I was not sure if it would work on my almost 2 years old laptop (I have
a desktop too but its even older). Laptop Specs are Celeron 2.0 Ghz, 256
meg RAM, 20 gig HDD, Intel Extreme Graphics video.  The graphics is what
I was afraid would keep it from working but for the 15 minutes or so of
play so far it has been ok. ;)

 

I noticed in the advanced options on the check for new files screen that
there were other packs I could download like Everquest Legends, Omens of
War and "optional Zones"

 

I checked that I did want these three things and it downloaded a bunch
more files. Does this mean I now have access to Omens of war and
Legends? Because I thought Legends was like $30/month to use that server
and I never heard of Omens of war. Any idea what exactly the "optional
Zones" are? 

 

 

Basically do I have to buy anything more to use Omens of War and these
optional Zones? Like I said after I installed EQ Platinum and check in
Advanced that I wanted the Omens of War, Legends and option Zones it
downloaded a bunch more files.

 

 

Another thing. Since its been a LONG time since I have played what are
the hot web sites to get tips/tricks/any helpful 3rd party apps or
helpers ( I don't mean cheats ). 

 

 

Thanks in Advance for any guidance
