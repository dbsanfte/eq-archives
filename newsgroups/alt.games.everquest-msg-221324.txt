From what I've seen, no race seems to have a cultural chain that's worth
getting over much cheaper bazaar items like barbed ringmail or tae ew
chain.

I went with a dwarven rogue of Bristlebane, and my guess that
Bristlebane would be tolerated by some of the evil gods has held true so
far. While pickpocketting the dark elf rogue guildmaster in Neriak with
dark elf illusion up I was dubious. I haven't tried going to Cabilis
with illusion iksar up yet though, or to Paineel with illusion erudite.
