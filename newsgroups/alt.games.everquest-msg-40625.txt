 You would use instill doubt if you were outdoors and soloing or with
someone who can snare. Helpful advice: When you're in a dungeon either
don't use ID or better yet take it out of your main bank. It's very easy
to hit it out of habit and have it actually work and having a mob run
away into a dungeon. The results aren't pretty.

 Feign Death you use to make mobs think you're dead and to leave you
alone. You're normally using ID for two reaons: Fear kiting mobs or
giving you enough time to zone or FD safely (or split two mobs).

 You'll be using FD much more than you'll be using ID. ID is still a
good skill to raise. However it is a slow one.

 You can use any special attack you want however you can only use one at
a time. Meaning you can still Tiger Claw, but you wont be able to Eagle
Strike until Tiger Claw ungrays (recycles).
