Keep tuned to AGE to find out what PoP looks like, because I'm afraid to
say, you won't be seeing it this side of XMas.

I'll be doing what I usually do. 

USA friend buys it at local store morning of release
Rips it onto private ftp site
I DL files as they hit the server.
Borrow an account key from someone's 3rd alt
Once it hits the store over here, buy as many copies as I need in the
Local store, and give new account key to the other person.
Ready to play the new expansion as soon as servers come up.

If the Euro version turns out to be some ridiculous non-compatible
version, I'll buy a version online and have it sent to someone in the
US. Or I'll get someone with a paypal account to buy one at the local
store and I'll transfer the cash via paypal.

Against the letter of the EULA 'law'? Probably, but I'm buying the
software, just bypassing the laziness and bureaucracy that would
otherwise prevent me from playing the game, and starting PoP at a severe
disadvantage at my stage of the game. Would it *really* be so hard to
run a simultaneous global release?
