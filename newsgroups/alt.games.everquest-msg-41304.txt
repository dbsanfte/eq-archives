The biggest gameplay difference, perhaps.  There will be massive
roleplay (or if that word annoys you, "ambiance") differences.  And
there will be a lot of minor gameplay differences that add up too.

Don't underestimate this group.  EQ is well-known and documented, and
there are a whole lot of players who have finished the game.  Most of
them don't know it yet, but still...

The excitement of starting from scratch in an environment where I've
not seen every zone in the game is a big draw for me.

>2. People that like PvP, but don't like EQ's PvP implementation.

I'm interested in DAoC's use of PvP, but fundamentally I cannot imagine
a good mix of character development and PKing, and I cannot imagine a
PvP setup that doesn't include a lot of random PK.  I have high hopes
and low expectations for the "human-controlled monsters" that DAoC
intends.

My need for PvP combat is well-handled by Half-life and UT.  If I get
killed 30 times I don't lose hours or days of building.

Category 3 is "people who are annoyed by various small aspects of EQ
that DAoC does differently".  Some don't like the rigid class system,
some hate that everyone looks the same, some hate the loot-dependence,
etc.  All of these things will be different in each MMORPG, and each
will fit different people's likes and dislikes.

For me, the only reason I'll switch from EQ (and I really only have time
for one ORPG, if that) is because it's new, and it'll only hold my attention
if cooperative grouping is as prevalent as in EQ.

I've tried a few other MMORPGs and the main thing that seems to be missing
is the availability of groups and the necessity of working together.  It's
a common complaint about EQ that grouping is almost rammed down the
players' throats, but it's the only thing that's kept me in the game for
this long.

Interestingly, it's the same thing that made first person shooters
fun for me.  I didn't play much Quake or it's decendents until the
team mods started to come out, and working together actually mattered.
