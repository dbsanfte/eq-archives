More powerful than NECROS?

What definition of 'powerful' are we using here?  Druids are awesome
solo'ers, but down time is a bitch.  In the time that my druid can
quad four mobs and med back up to get more, a necro will have easily
done 4 or 5 and is still going without stopping.  

Necros are hideously powerful.  If we're talking sustained damage
output, they're much more powerful than druids.  They lack the utility
that druids have, so it all evens out though.
