No one seems to like the gforce 4 mx, but there are several different
version out there the mx 440 out performs the geforce 3ti500.  Its the
200/220 that sucks rocks.  And the mx 440 is about 105 US dollars where I am
at anyhow.  I have run the benchmarks on the geforce 2 ultra, geforce 2 mx
400, geforce 3 ti 500, and geforce 4 mx 200 and 440, and i am really
impressed with the 440 for the price...Of course the ati 8500 is a nice
card, but eq seems to have problems with it...But eq isn't the only game I
play :>)
