Hi all,

	Personally the best I have seen (apart from people just having
the decency to give everyone a go, my first choice) is the alpha loot.
Everyone takes turns alphabetically.  Then it is just luck of the draw
who gets what.  Mind you, everyone should still have autosplit on
(except sometimes with monks who don't like it).

	My own policy is, if you loot something that someone else needs,
give it too them.  You never know when you might want the favour
returned.  I have got several good items just by being generous to
people previously.

	Good luck and remember, don't be afraid to ask what the groups
loot policy is.

	Happy hunting.

Regards,

Wayne...
