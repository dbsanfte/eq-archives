From the questions you asked about tracking, bow kiting and such, it
seems you already have your mind made up =) However, I have seen very
little comment about your third choice, the bard.

When played well, a talented bard can do amazing things. They can solo
effectively for most of their career, they have the ability to make a
good group great, and to make a poor group at least functional.

Their assortment of songs cover the entire spectrum of spell effects,
from Enchanters (charm, mez, mana regen) to Necros (DoT, fear) to
Druids (Snare, SoW) to Shaman (buffs for every stat) to Clerics (HP
Regen, buffs) and they do it without using a single point of mana for
the most part (there are a small handfull of songs that use a
negligible amount of mana)

The power of a bard comes from the skill of "twisting" or "weaving"
songs in order to have more than one effect up at one time. The jist
of it is that you start one song, when the song has taken effect, stop
it and start another one. With practice, you can have three song
effects up at once.

To keep slightly on topic here, bard tracking is very bare bones. You
do not have the ability to sort at all. The list is sorted by the
order that mobs spawn. If you are looking for a particular spawn, or
looking for a group member, it is invaluable. Even without the
sorting, I always use it at least a couple times per session.

With long range DoT's, bards have no need for a bow. Combining one or
two DoT's with either our running speed song (Selos Accelerando) or
snare, we can kite single mobs with ease. At later levels, we employ
charm and Selos to perform "swarm kiting".

All it takes is a little practice. That is why I have a love/hate
relationship with twink bards. I hate them because they will not have
the chance to test out and refine their skills with twisting and
changing songs as the group changes. I love them because as they get
into the higher levels, they get frustrated and quit. This way, I know
that if I see a high level bard in the future, I know that they have
stayed around because they love to play the class and that they are
relatively good at what they do.

If you do decide to try on a bard for size, here are a few websites to
visit to find out more information on the art of a bard:

Hope that helps!
