This also works for Shamen, which is where I first learned the practice,
their Inner Fire spell is better than any heal they get up to 20... and
even at 20, it just happens that the time they spend chain casting
IF would finally be better spent casting a big heal and then medding,
even though that heal is nominally less efficient.

Druid HP buffs, on the other hand, increase your max HP but not
your current HP.  They are -not- a heal, and recasting them does
nothing but refresh their duration.

Hmm, you may encounter a paladin with a Deepwater Helm.  This
paladin only item has a clickable, targetable effect that casts.. I think
Valor, at any rate a HP buff.  Paladins with this helm will often
refuse a higher level cleric HP buff, so that they can use the effect
I describe to heal themselves with no mana cost.  Since the buff is
small compared to their HP total, and it robs them of a potentially
much higher HP total, and must be chain cast for quite some
time, this stops being practical if there is a cleric in the group
somewhere in the 40s.... but it does make soloing or partnering
without a real healer a possibility.

At the high end, I've done the math, and Heroic Bond is the most
efficient way to heal your party if they are all damaged a bubble
or two.  This is true at least up to 53, and I think I looked further
and it continues to be true thru 60.  It certainly beats the group
heal Word Of Vigor all hollow.  On the other hand, it can't hold
a candle to my Thurg quest pants, and their tiny 105 point each heal
that costs no mana at all, unless everyone needs a sizable heal fast.
