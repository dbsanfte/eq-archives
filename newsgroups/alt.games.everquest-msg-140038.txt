}not to sound like an illiterate, but wtf is that?
}i actually looked it up, as i generally know english . .
}is this more of that "ooh i make up words for effect" stuff? i won't be mad,
}i'm just curious

Ahh, no, he misspells words for effect. :)

Chronosynclastic Infundibulum: a phrase invented by Kurt Vonnegut in The 
Sirens of Titan, meaning "those places ... where all the different kinds 
of truths fit together".

}btw, why are you making all this stuff up about gating and luclin?

I think I can answer for him on thisone... "Because it's fun." :)

}if this is actual game lore, 

Dependson whether you require it to have Verant(tm)'s Seal of Approval for 
it to be "actual".

}may i ask about death?

Surely, ask away. :)

}dying in eq is fucking dumb to me, is there a better explanation?

You're not dead, just temporarily hit point challenged.

}who could call this a role-playing game, when after you die you simply 
}appear, magically and without question, with or without your worldly 
}items, depending on a ranking that does not exist (level) in any role 
}play?

I can.  Watch close now... nothing up my sleeve...

It's a role playing game. :)

}speaking of which, the idea that being struck inflicts numerical damage is
}as opposite of role-playing as can be; how does that fit? you fall, walking
}down steps when heavily encumbered, and take 6 damage . . . this is not a
}role-playing game . . .

Sure it is.  You take on the role of a persona in a fantastical universe 
very different from our own.  In this role, you play.  The 'game' part is 
harder to justify, since some people use a limited definition of 'game' 
that includes the idea that you 'win' or 'lose' somehow.  I agree that the 
health-as-numerical-value is distracting, but it's just another way in 
which this reality is diferent from our own.

I can just see one of my characters trying to play me...  First they'd 
wonder where the heck the F9 key is so they could get out of fullscreen 
mode, then they'd wonder what class I am that I seemed to have safe fall, 
enchanter-like hitpoints, no spells, and no melee ability to speak of.  
Then they'd wonder where all the exp mobs are and why they can't manage to 
con anything.  Eventually, with a little luck, they might try the "Finish 
the Degree" quest.

You have gained expeience! 
Your faction standing with Family has improved!
Your faction standing with PotentialEmployers has improved!
Ding! Welcome to level 2.
