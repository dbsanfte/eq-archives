On our guild boards, a question came up about the "Foraging Machette"
you can quest for on Luclin. This evolved into a conversation about the
effects of skill enhancing items in general, and in particular the
rather arcane specifics of the foraging skill.  The following is a post
I made in that thread which has lead to some interesting discussions and
information. I thought I would toss it out here as well to see what is
known, or what some of your own observations and opinions are on these
items and how some of these skills work "under the covers" in the
obscure depths of VI's code.
******************************
[begin cut/paste text]
Caution: The following is not hard fact, but rather my own opinion,
molded from reading up on related subjects in various online forums. (Or
fora, if you prefer.)

Skills up near the top end of the range (and this covers a lot of
skills, by the way) and the specifics of the newer "skill modifier"
items are not very well understood, and Verant is being very closed
mouthed about it.  A lot of what we are seeing in the EQ community on
this subject is nothing more than rampant speculation and wishful
thinking.

Some things are pretty well established. Examples are that higher
INT/WIS (and occasionally something else like STR for smithing) results
in more frequent skill increases. But even *that* gets subjected to
debate, as I've read people saying that if you use items to take your
skill over 250, it acts like a *lower* skill level.

The failure rates seem to be *fairly* well understood for basic cases.
There's just some arcane random number generator in there that gives you
a tiny chance of success on something way over your skill level, and
apparently a 5% chance of failure on something completely trivial to
you. Recently I converted two full stacks of wulf fish into high quality
fish bones for Orlun. I had two failures out of forty tries, so that
number seems fairly valid.

The effect of skill bonus items is likewise muddled. Do they "stack" if
you have more than one item? How/where do they have to be equipped to
give the bonus? How can you confirm that the bonus is actually giving
you a higher effective skill?  If you have a 200 skill at smithing and
equip a 10% skill modifer item and a 5% modifier item, do you get an
effective skill of 230? (which would just be 115% of 200) Or do you get
an effective skill of 231? (Which would be 200 plus ten percent, then
plus five percent of *that* result.) Or does it just take the higher of
the two items and only give you that, resulting in an effective skill of
220? Can these effects even *be* stacked?

Of all the skills, foraging is probly the most obscure. It's not like
you forage up some roots and get a message saying "You can no longer
increase your skill by foraging this item."  And the rare things we are
often looking for these days seem to remain just as rare. I asked
previously if I could take a level one iksar with just native racial
forage ability to WW and forage for dragon eggs successfully. Some said
yes. Others said of course not.  So what effect your foraging skill
level has on your chances of success is, to me, pretty obscure.  Tossing
in an item with +10% to your foraging skill seems like it would be
impossible to test out with hard figures.

Fishing used to be as obscure as foraging, but with the addition of
tackle boxes and items to make that actually have trivial levels, it's
evolving into something closer to a tradeskill.

[End cut/paste text.]

The fishing portion of this discussion came about because the blessed
fishing rod gives a 5% modifier to fishing skill. Hintol's Fishbringer
Bait can be equipped in the ammo slot and says it gives a 2% bonus. If I
equip them both, what's my fishing skill? Everything that I can combine
in my tackle box now is trivial to me *except* the Blessed fishing rod.
And even equipping the two items mentioned above, it's still not a
trivial combine, so we've no way of knowing where it truly trivials.

The foraging question came up because I need stacks of dragon eggs to
make PoTC fishing rods, and they are annoyingly rare to forage.
