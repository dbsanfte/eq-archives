Who is more stupid, the programmers for letting bugs like this go, or the
paying customer that STAYS a paying customer even after bitching multiple
times about it?

Yup, I'm still paying...but I'm not bitching.  It's part of EQ that for any
big patch there's going to be subsequent patches.  Yup, they should do it
right the first time.  But either quit the game or quit bitching...your
choice, because it IS NOT going to get any better.  They've had THREE YEARS
to perfect testing procedures and they've proven to every SMART person that
it'll never happen.
