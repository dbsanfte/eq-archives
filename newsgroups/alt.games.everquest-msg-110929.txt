I don't know that anything can be done.  But it still saddens me that
"christian" has been synonymous with "self-serving mean-spirited bigot"
for so many people in so many times and places.  And I am angered by
the small-souled bigots who continue in large numbers to this day to
organize and proclaim themselves to be "christian" while the mob and
the mass media never question the absurdity of preaching hatred in
Jesus name.  I don't know that I'll ever clearly understand what is
or is not "evil" in the general case, but the twisted liars who lead
these folks are, in my mind (heads up Lokari!), parked down at the evil
end of the gray scale in the same neighborhood as Goebbels.

And that's gonna be my last post here for a while.  I play EQ and
participate in this group to relieve the stresses of everyday life.
That relief is compromised when "real" issues intrude too strongly.
Not sure if it was a good ro bad thing to join in on this thread, but
I am quite sure that it'll be a good thing to get away from it for
awhile.
