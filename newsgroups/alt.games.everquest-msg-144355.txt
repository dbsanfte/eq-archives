MODEL HATE CRIME STATUTE

1. Anyone who intentionally selects a person or public or private 
property to be the target of a criminal act because of the actual or 
perceived race, color, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender, 
or national origin or ancestry of another shall have the penalty for the 
underlying crime increased to the next higher offense level.


Note how it uses the word "perceived". Since clothes cover most of our 
body, they are what is most visible about us and contribute a lot to how 
others perceive us visually. For example, a man wearing a pink ballerina 
dress could easily be perceived as gay and victimised for it. The same 
can be said for religion or culture.

Now why should a killer be punished less for killing someone who he 
robbed than for killing someone who was wearing a pink ballerina dress?
