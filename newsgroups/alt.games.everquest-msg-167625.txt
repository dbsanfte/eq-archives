At first blush you'd think that the faction system could be used to
enforce roleplaying by putting the PCs on NPC faction(s).  But, as
soon as you start to think it through, huge opportunities for grief
play suggest themselves.  One of the most obvious would be "suicide
(faction) bombers", characters made strictly for the purpose of
dying in PvP and thereby damaging your target's faction.  The
combination of the disconnect from RL (which weakens the courtesies
trained into us by our family, friends, & etc.) and the difficulty
of applying meaningful sanctions to offenders (just try to define
grief play in a way that's useful to a "cop" or "judge") makes it
just too easy for the clever griefer to get his kicks at no cost
beyond the time he spends doing something he enjoys, which is no cost
at all.  I just can't see any way to have a relatively "open" PvP
system (as opposed to the restricted RvR of DAoC) in an environment
that allows anonymous play without frequent incidents of grief play.
