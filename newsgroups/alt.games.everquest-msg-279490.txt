Anyone can tank, any class, all that matters is gear.

Mkay.  So do you agree with me or not or you just bitching for the sake of

What the hell are you talking about.  Just because another class can do a
similar thing doesnt stop monks doing it, or mean that they have nothing
going for them now does it, Bael.

Monks can also get a snare item I believe, most abilities of all classes
have been made fairly easily available (one of the reasons I stopped
playing, 15 classes, all the same...zzzzzz).  That is what whining about
balance gets you.

 I was trying to disprove or prove anything, I dont give a shit I dont play
anymore, I was just stating facts as I see em, if you dont like them, well,
tough :)

In some situations monks are better pullers, in some, sk / necro are better
pullers, others bards or rangers are better pullers.  You dont NEED any one
class to do a pull of any kind.

In the modern game pulling is fairly irrelevant anyway.

No class in the game sucks, its only the people who play them that think
they do.  Every class forum has whiners x class is better than my class!!
Waaa.  Gets old after a while, if you aint having fun, turn the fuckin pc
off.
