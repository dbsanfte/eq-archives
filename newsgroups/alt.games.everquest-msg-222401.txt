Incorrect, you want to find the weapon with the best ratio of
(damage*2+1)/delay for you off hand.  Your off hand will get a chance to 
swing everytime the off hand weapon delay time has gone by.  Whether or not 
you actually swing with the off hand weapon at that time will be based on a 
skill check of your dual wield skill.
