I was having a BIG problem with EQ crashing unexpectedly to the desktop with
no error message.  I had tried everything that the EQ Tech people had said,
nothing helped.  I came across a diagnostic program while reading through
some posting on the VIA Arena support pages.  Someone suggested using a
program called SiSoftware's Sandra to diagnose problems and analyze their
system. I found the software at Cnet's site, the link is below.

What I discovered is that I had a stick of RAM that was mislabeled PC133
when in fact it was PC100.  I had my memory slots configured to run at
133Mhz. I went into my BIOS and changed the memory slots to run at 100Mhz
and I was able to get into and play EQ for several hours on 2 occasions with
no problems.

I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this was the fix that was needed. I'm
sure not everyone having this crashing to desktop problem has a RAM issue
but, this Sandra software is an awesome tool to help diagnose PC problems.
The Standard edition is free but, not all of the tools are available.  I'm
not sure how much the Professional edition costs but, I'm going to look into
it.

I hope this helps someone.
