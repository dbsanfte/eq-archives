Lessee...

That was his first complaint.
Then, he complained about the events without direct GM control (like
the current red sky zones) ending before he gets there - guess he
doesn't have the patience to come back 3 hours later, or just hang
around Rathe Mountains.
Then, his EQ-capable computers are broken. Guess he threw them out the
window after the level 60 depopped WC...
- and: "And really get right down to it, do you always drop your group
cause you hear something cool is going on?" (Mister, if you want to
see events and know where they are, you drop your grouping. Or, should
the events come to your group during your scheduled play hours to make
you happy?)

There should be an award for being capable of whining like this about
something so easily amended...
