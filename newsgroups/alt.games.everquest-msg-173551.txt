I had much the same problem with Points system guilds in my past; what was
happening was that people were accumulating points faster than they were
spending them.  This meant that the same people always had first access to new
items which dropped, and the only way for anyone else to ever see loots was when
the higher ranked people had their stuff already.

After a lot of hashing out of these issues in this newsgroup, I came to the
conclusion that rather than the points concept being broken, I'd simply had bad
luck in joining several guilds who had bad points expenditure setups.

When getting a good item means many many hours of raiding, this isn't so bad.
Guilds I was in in the past would give out say 10 points per person for a raid,
and items would drop going for 10 to 50 points each.  This doesn't sound bad...
but 30 people got 10 points each, or 300 points, and 4 items would drop with a
net of 100 points spent... each raid you'd have an average of 200 more points in
the guild than before!

The guild I'm in now uses a bid system for items, and awards roughly a point per
hour.  Same 2 hour raid as before, same 4 high powered items drop, you are
likely to see 60 points come in and as many as 100 points go out; this would be
a net loss, except that on some raids we get triple points, or certain FFA
targets are rated at 3 points despite taking well under an hour to complete; on
average in the long run outgo is close to equal to income.

The best items still tend to go to the people who raid a lot, but the principle
reason for this is that those people already have very nice gear, and so rarely
bid on lesser items.  This means they save up points.  The beauty of the bidding
system in this instance is that when  great item does drop, it can go for
extraordinary amounts of points, rapidly clearing out bank accounts; the hate
increasing weapon dropped off POI dragon for us the other day and went for 183
points; thats 183 hours of the lucky tanks' life (or maybe only 60 hours if he
did only triple point raids)

Static point values for items leave a potential for massive points accretion
going unchecked, what I like about the bidding system we are using now is that
items set their own values, and that value tends to decline in time.  Being the
first to get uber item X costs a lot, so they go to the heavy raiders.  Being
the fourth or fifth to get the same item, it tends to go far more cheaply, this
levels out the playing field in favor of the more casual raiders, I tend to pay
around 20 points for an item that originally went for 60 points; the other guy
got one first, but when I got it, it was for 20 hours of raiding, instead of for
three times that, which is roughly proportianal to the hours we put in on raids!

Then there's the benefit of running an unusual class.  My bard has finally
started raiding with the guild... and has picked up some very high powered items
for very few points, because he's often the only bard there, or the other one
bard present already has that item.   For the guild, this is fine, because those
items would rot otherwise, and instead they are getting a powered up bard.  Too,
in the high end, each class brings advantages to a raid, in most cases such that
having One of each class present is more usefull than having a third or fourth
issue of one of the other classes.  In my case, the alternative is a cleric,
which is a class that does stack well on raids... but we are often wishing we
had a bard along, too.
