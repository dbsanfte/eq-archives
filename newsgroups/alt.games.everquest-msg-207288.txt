For even more fun...do it with a very low level Ranger.  My first character
to make it to level 2 tried it from Qeynos at that level.  The only zones
I'd ever even heard about where North and South Qeynos, Qeynos Hills,
Surefell Glade, Freeport, Ocean of Tears, Butcherblock, and Greater
Faydark--the first four because I'd been there, and the last four because a
friend told me about them.  I wanted to get to Freeport to meet up with the
friend.  I knew from the cloth map in the box that Freeport was to the East,
and so off I went.

Being a Ranger, that character had tracking....and all kinds of scary things
were showing up.  I was new enough to not know about aggro range, so every
time something new and scary showed up, I had to use tracking to see where
it was and *slowly* creep up to where I could see it and /con it.  I figured
mob AI would be kind of like the AI in some of the Quake bots I'd seen...so
was giving things like bandit camps a lot of room.

Made it to Highpass, where I turned a corner and ran into three hostile
NPCs who were around level 18, and that ended that trip.  It was fun.
