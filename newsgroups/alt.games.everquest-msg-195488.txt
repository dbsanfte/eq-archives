I agree about not leveling too fast  I have a 32 cleric on Xegony
which iI hardly cannot use spells due to fizzle.  Now there are times
that I get KEI just to waste spellson myself.  Tried to heal people in
need and they died due to lack of skills.  Its nice to have a 52 Druid
for pling but be careful not to too fast.

52 Druid Geripep on Xegony and 32 Cleric Sadiegirl
Happy Hunting , be safe and have FUN
