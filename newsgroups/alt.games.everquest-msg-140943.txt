you have to put it in your primary hand.
They don't help with learning, except that when making jewelry after say
electrum malachite,  your effective skill will be higher than the trivial,
so you will have fewer failures, and therefore less cost.

If your skill is 250, the effective cap is 252 so they don't help much.
If your skill is approximately 243, they place you at or over the cap, so
you don't have to worry about those last few skillups.
