Turning the Packet Loss Meter off by default is a major stuff up with
newbies. EQ will now get a reputation as that game that disconnects you
all the time. The game will go to treacle, then bing "You have been
disconnected"

WTF will be a mild version when this keeps happening.

Before, people could see this thing start to flash read and look up what
it is from the game help. This tells them that their disconnection is
their ISP service, not SOE's problem (other issues aside).


The in game help also explained what the numbers were.
