Ok 3rd view was changed.  It used to work,  it was what I used to Kite.  Now
the 3rd and 4th view are the exact same.  I think that might have been one
of the minore nerf when they got rid of the clasic UI.  I think I am going
to send in a bug report tonight.

It was nice to beable to pull the camera way far away form you and put it so
you wher looking at yourself and all the creatures you were pulling.  So for
now here is only 4 diferent views.
