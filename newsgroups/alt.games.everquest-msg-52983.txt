OK, I'll concede this, but there are non-AE fights that this could
effect.  I think this would have a greater effect on single-group
battles.  What's that named frog in Swamp of No Hope that is for druid
(monk?) epic?

So you slap a MR/FR/CR buff on 'em, it's not great, but it's better
than nothing.  Also, you can loot an entire corpse in aobut 10 seconds
now, more than enough time to get back in and be useful.

I don't know about that.  I recall one Trak raid that ended with a
single live necro.  Sure it's rare, but I have also seen lots of WW
dragon killings that ended with the dragon at a sliver and 20 corpses.

Bah!  You're a rogue, right?  You can't bind in Ogguk or Neriak?
Hell, I'm a bard with our worthless sneak and I was binding in Ogguk
as soon as I got my mask.  I did die a time or two, but had more to do
with not understanding the limitations of sneak.  If I could have done
the old sneak/hide trick, I would never have had a problem.

OK, melee binding could make it easier for a random group of people to
do a random, underutilized dungeon, but I don't see a lot of people
going to those dungeons even if melee could bind there.  If you're
going to anything like that you either have a cleric, shaman, or druid
with you for a healer, so you can rez or port in 2/3 of the cases.

Except that I would end up being expected to change it to wherever I'm
hunting, and then would be stuck bound at the Seb orb with no easy way
(TL to bind) to get to any of the fun places in Velious.  At least the
towns in Velious are fairly close to several good hunting grounds.
Hmmm, thinking about this some more, I take that back.  If I could
bind in PoM, I would do so now and never bitch again.

Actually, we like it that way.  The less they think about us, the less
likely they are to break something.  We also don't bitch much, comes
from being too tired from twisting to type anymore.
