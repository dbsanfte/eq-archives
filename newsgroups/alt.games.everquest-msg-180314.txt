First, code documentation doesn't fall from the sky like mana. It takes
time and effort. In academia, those asking for code documentation don't
have to pay for it in any way. In the business world, time and effort
translate into dollars. If you want documented code you have to pay for
it, either with extra time in the schedule to allow for documenting, or
extra coders to do the extra work without slipping the schedule. If you
work on a government contract for Boeing, you can bet the government wants
documented code and is willing to pay for it. Other clients are more
concerned with getting their product out by the end of the month so they
can get it on the shelves at Circuit City before Christmas, and don't care
about documentation. In either case, the decision is typically not Joe
Coder's to make, and has no bearing on whether Joe is a crappy coder or
not.

Second, code documentation doesn't always have any payoff. In academia,
the payoff is immediate. Graders read the documentation to verify that a
student's design is plausible, and use the documentation to make sense of
the student's (likely inexpert) code. In the business world, documentation
per se is something the end user often never sees, doesn't care about, and
doesn't want to pay for. It's overhead. What the documentationphile hopes
for is that the documentation will be read at some point and that the
savings gleaned by reading the documentation will more than pay for the
price of writing and maintaining said documentation. But be clear, this
is a gamble: a risk. Sometimes this gamble pays off, sometimes it doesn't.
And if you don't believe it will pay for itself, or if you can't afford
the up-front investment cost of documenting, it's a very reasonable choice
to simply not document code. And again, this has *no* bearing on whether
Joe Coder is a crappy coder or not.

So. If you're going to be throwing shit at people -- and I think "if you're
not [documenting your code] then you're a crappy coder" fairly counts as
"throwing shit" -- you should make very sure (a) that your target deserves
it, and (b) that your target is the only one hit by it. Neither of which
did you succeed at.

If this is just a religious position for you, like how to "correctly"
indent your code and where the curly braces "should" be placed, by all
means say so. Facts aren't relevant to that kind of argument.
