Then your warrior isn't doing his job.
At level 50, a warrior with cleric buffs should be around 3000 to
3200hps (assuming it's not some stupid 75 base STA race warrior).
Complete heal against a pure melee mob is not only viable, it's the
most efficient way to fight.

By the time the first complete heal hits you, you should have built up
MORE than enough aggro to keep Slate on you without the cleric ever
having to worry about over aggro.

As for mana, NOTHING compares to the mana efficiency as complete heal.
Even at your level, there's nothing the cleric has that can come
close.

Celestial Heal if I remember correctly, does about 3:1 heal:mana ratio
no?  At 3000hps, even if you get CH prematurely at 1 bubble, you're
healing about 2400hps for 400 mana.  That's double the Celestial Heal
efficiency.

Been there done that.
