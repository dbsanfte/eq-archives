People won't be able to grasp that. The most sure-fire way to keep
people from trying to get them involved is to tell them that they're
not allowed to do it. That way, they have the threat of a banning
hanging over their heads to remind them not to go whining to the GMs
if they get ripped off on an account trade.

I do not think witchcraft is a religion, and I do not think it is in any 
way appropriate for the U.S. military to promote it.

-- George W. Bush, October 15, 2000 

(Notice how Bush does away with the Wiccan's right to religious liberty
by redefining Wicca as not a religion and further denigrating it with 
the term witchcraft.)
