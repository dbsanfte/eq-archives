Were they in front of MB's room, or positioned at the corner?   I only scanned
your strategy, but I was left with the impression that they would be guarding
the door.

They need to be doing thier thing in each corner, so theres enough time to
grab everything that is coming.  That way even if one gets past them, they can
still mez it before it gets to the door (and once they aggro it it will lose
all interest in the door.)

Also, I didn't see any mention of AE heals.  Those are key on an MB fight,
since most of his damage comes from AE DoT's.  You'll want a druid able to MGB
Spirit of the Wood, and a cleric to MGB Celestial Regeneration.   (And for the
melee to save four open buff slots, 2 for DoT's 2 for Heals.)  A second of
each would be even better, since they would be able to renew it when the first
fades.   If MB is still alive at the end of the second AE heal, you've already
lost.  Burn, burn, burn him down the moment the tank has good aggro.  Melee
discs on charge.
