My main in EQ was a female druid. Not for any gender bending reasons, 
but simply I ending up having the most fun with that char/class and I 
usually pick a different class/race/gender each time I create a new char 
and I just ended up sticking with that one.

The vast 99.9 percent of my EQ life consisted of:

* Running to/looking for orcs to whack
* Whacking orcs
* Running from orcs
* Looking for better stuff to whack orcs with

The fact that I was really a guy never came up except for a few rare 
occasions. The core group of friends I made the subject came up once for 
the first time and that was the end of it. No one gave a crap what I 
'really was,' just as long as I kept them alive and sow'ed.

However, the remaining 0.1 percent of EQ it was a MAJOR issue. There 
were two guys who were absolutely pissed and at the same time 
bewildered. They had spent their lives actively being NOT GAY. The way 
they talked, the things they did, the clothes they wore, the friends 
they made all were carefully chosen throughout life to make it perfectly 
clear to the world that they were NOT GAY.

And out of the blue and in a very sneaky and unfair way someone had 
'tricked' them into GAYNESS, at least in their way of looking at the 
world. They had acted romantically/sexually with a real life guy. How 
could someone do something so underhanded.

All I could say was whatever, let's get back to whacking orcs.
