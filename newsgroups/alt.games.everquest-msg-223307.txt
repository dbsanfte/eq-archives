LOL, not that i hate the server, it is just that I havent played on it 
in over 2 months because my RL husband and game husband are playing more 
frequently and my time is taken up on my main server, SolRo...

So, i gave my equipment away to newbies i know there, and gave the plat 
to Lance, because he could put it to good use=)

You play where you are happy =) When I started on FV, there wasnt 
anything on SolRo - was burnt out by ex-guildies and a seriously bad 
deguilding experience, and had no desire to make all new friends, and my 
current friends were all on differing schedules so i decided to play a 
different server.

If something happens on Sol Ro, I can go back to FV, and I know how to 
play so i can get back into the swing of things, but in the mean time no 
sense in keeping stuff when others could benefit from it=)
