I was hunting in Blackburrow yesterday and ran up to the Elite ledge. Looked
around and saw nobody, so I pulled from there. Next thing I know is I am
getting tells, "You stole my camp!" I shot back I did not see anyone there.
To which the reply was I am hiding while I heal. Well. I am sorry, but if
you are hiding and I can not SEE you and you are so low on health as to need
the rest, let some one else pull from an area. Especially on such a quick
spawn as the ledge.
