I should have been more specific, sorry. *Some* of the zone names are
apparently correct as per a list of certains zones designated for some
reason (which I'm not privy to).  This list was apparently given to the
guides. A friend of mine is one, and some of the zone names on that map
match up with the ones on that list. 

No, this guide isn't giving me any actual information which would be of
use/advantage to me. Simply confirming some names and such, not in
violation of their "hush hush" rules.
