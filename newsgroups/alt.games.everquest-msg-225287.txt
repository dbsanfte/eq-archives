This last category will never affect your pet.  Only way I can think of 
to see a pet with overhaste would be for someone to charm a PC who has 
it... and as far as I know, only NPC's can charm PC's these days. 
Fortunately, overhaste has a short duration, so you won't have to worry 
about ubertank long.

Some items enable you to give yourself spell haste or even song haste, 
but both those show up in icon form, and don't count as item haste.
