When they haven't even considered how traders will enter apartments I don't
consider that part of any phase.
I think it has more to do with common sense planning.

I am not in Beta test.
I get information about games from beta testers once NDA's are over.
I find that more reliable and realistic than from the producer.
If it is a title I am interested in I try it no matter what any one says.
Sometimes I ask myself why didn't I listen to the ranters or why did I
listen to the zealots and buy this game.
Other times the things others didn't enjoy I actually have liked. /shrug

I do not like companies saying a b c is in the game only to discover it
really isn't.
Kind of like how rogues were in EQ at launch and alchemy was working as
intended for almost a year ( well a long time if not a year ).
