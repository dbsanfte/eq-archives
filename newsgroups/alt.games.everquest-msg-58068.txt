Very well said.  I took up smithing because it added a dimension to the
game.  Yes, it ate up a lot of cash.  But it was fun, and I have enjoyed the
interaction with other players, making armor, and various other bits and
pieces.  I have also, due to the shawl quests, taken up tailoring, baking,
and brewing.  Being a shaman, I took up alchemy as well, so far, the only
trade skill that has made me a profit.
