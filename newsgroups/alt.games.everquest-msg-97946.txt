You're asking what the tradeoff is between HP and AC is.  Good question,
and probably depends a lot on the circumstance.

I don't play a high-level warrior (level 36), but I heal a lot of high
level warriors (level 60 cleric) so hopefully I'm qualified to make
some suggestions...

First off, we'll ignore any STR or DEX bonuses, since they really don't
mean very much at all.

The Centi LS is the best off-hand weapon you have there (off-hand, just
worry about the ratio, ignore the delay).  The 8 STA is great, that's
around 50 HP (if I'm not mistaken).  It could be argued that the Jagged
Blade is better for taunting (slightly lower delay), and the 10 MR / 3
AC is nice.  I'd take the Centi LS though - that STA bonus is very good.

For primary hand, the Lammy & the Defiance are the choices.  I'd take
the 10 AC on the Defiance over the 20 HP on the Lammy.

What you really need in the long run though is something with a good
high-aggro proc (combined with a low delay).

So... I'd probably sell the Lammy & the Jagged Blade.  Any more
experienced warriors care to correct me? :)
