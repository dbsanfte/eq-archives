You are looking for a Female Erudite in PoK.  She is *near* the main bank, but
not right next to it...  

Lemme see if I can describe this...  Ok, you're at the main bank, standing in
front of it, looking across at the vendors past the tree over there.  (If you
face the bank, they would be to your left).

There is a Rock Wall behind that Trader Building...  Go along that Rock Wall
behind that trader building and she is standing right against that wall.  If
I'm thinking correctly, she is almost directly below the overpass that goes to
the library if that makes sense.

Good luck!  :)
