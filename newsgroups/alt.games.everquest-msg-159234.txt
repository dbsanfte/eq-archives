}And we should pay attention to a maroon who gives himself such

You are aware you're posting to alt.games.everquest, aren't you?  The game 
assigns the titles...  Assuming you didn't know that, look at the 
Newsgroups: line in your header.

This is yet another reason you shouldn't reply to stupid crossposted 
trolls.
