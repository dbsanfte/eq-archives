Tut tut! Do you guys not run through strats for new recruits / people who
missed the event?

Thats from not having spell casting subtlety! :)

This part is not quite accurate, but Im also not sure what exactly you mean
by the 4 "guardians" either.
The 4 golems (per side, 8 in total) are before the minis die.. their death
opens the north door.  Immediatly inside is 2 trash, then a 6 mob trap. Then
you clear upto the second trap door (commonly known as the gas chamber
rooms... but in a Euro guild, its a bit of a taboo word for some members, so
we try to avoid that term..)

After the trap room are some indifferent NPC's, which are triggers to spawn
the next set of mobs. The point that the AE stops is immediatly when you do
this mob spawn, not when you kill anything.

Hmm.. its a fun fight, but I don't think its particularly complex. The
number of adds is determined by how long you take... and aside from those,
at most you never have more than 3 mobs to deal with (incidently, the only
part of the encounter which you didn't mention, the 2 later adds, is pretty
much the toughest part of the whole script)

Actually the expedition is closed the moment you open the next door, after
killing the set of spawned mobs (after trap room2)

Actually Devastating Construct is the golem you fight after sealing the
expedition.  Behind the door that seals the expedition, is the roamer
(devastating) and some trash mobs.. hes also the second loot dropper (after
the twins)

All these need to die, to talk to the NPC that then removes the seal from
Barxt's door - Guardian of Destruction is the golem that you meant here

I think thats just caution really.. there is really no need to have stopped
hitting it. The next set of adds would pause the script anyway.

There really is a message warning when you enter the final 15 minutes of an
expedition, its not text though (appears in the middle of the player
window), and everybody in the raid sees it.

Once you have a working strat, you will really love the next zones scripts
then...
Theres a shitload of info nowadays, when we were learning the script it was
a really cryptic process and we had nfc if we were on the right tracks, if
the zone was even finished and winnable etc...

It was a lot of hard work back then,. and when you finally reached a certain
point of the script, an encounter would devestate your raid in the blink of
an eye.. cruel fate after the world of pain that pre-nerf mite area was...
the script will probably blow your mind when you first try, and die
horribly.. but when you realise what went on, and how to deal with it.. its
really an amazingly well thought out event.

If you ever wondered if an encounter could stop the last 5 expansions worth
of afk auto attacking a mob, with a bunch of bot clerics in a chain and a
really static fight.. well its a resounding yes here.
