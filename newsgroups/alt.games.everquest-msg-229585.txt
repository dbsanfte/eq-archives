I wish pottery still worked that way.  They nerfed the prices of pottery 
combines to oblivion.  I assumed they had done the same to all 
tradeskills.

Again, if they did the same thing to smithing sellback prices they did to 
pottery ones, then, the vendor sellback price will be well under 1gp per 
item, rather than just a small loss per item.
