Why not?  Some people pay others to whip them and degrade them.

Actually, a Level 52 Shaman in our guild went into LFay a while back,
headed for Mistmoore.  She got jumped by 1, maybe 2, brownies.  She
didn't last long enough to get a good count.

Basic rule, don't go into LFay without checking the maps first.  It's
sorta like your first accidental arrival at Orc Hill.

Oh, what class are you?

Face it, that's how all of the quests were originally discovered, by
people going and questioning every single NPC in the area.  When
reading up on the quests (allakhazam has a very good list), just read
the basic quest info and gloss over the noise.  Some of the noise is,
admitted, useful, but you need to put it in perspective.
