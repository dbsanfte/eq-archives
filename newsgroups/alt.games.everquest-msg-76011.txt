Faction hits for kobolds are tiny.  Do what I did - kill a few Erudite
guards (one's just inside from Tox are easier) for much, much bigger hits.
I hunted kobolds for an hour or more and saw no change.  Killed a dozen
guards and went from scowling to apprehensive.

Sure, I'm KoS in Erudin, but there's not much there that a rogue needs.
