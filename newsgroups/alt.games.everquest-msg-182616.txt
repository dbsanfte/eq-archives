Right, but I wasn't commenting on, or advocating, discrimination.

But it *is* warranted.  The example I gave is that better medical
care can be provided when you divide up the human races into all
the individual races.

I disagree.  If my doctor keeps my race in mind, my doctor might
be able to treat me better.

See, this is precisely the problem I see when people are TOO "color
blind".  Putting your head in the sand and declaring us all exactly
the same is misguided (imho).  We're different.  And that's okay.

Of course it does.  So does gender.  So do disabilities.  Lots of
things make us different.  And that's still okay.  :)

The 'wandering eye' I had growing up left me with lousy binocular
vision.  I'm not the same as you: you have binocular vision.  And
that's okay too!  I'm not going to get all sensitive if you divide
people into two groups: those with binocular vision and those
without binocular vision.  I'm not going to accuse you of
"visionism" or of being a "visionist" if you decide that my lack
of good binocular vision means I can never get a license to
pilot a 747.  I'm different.  I know that.  And that's okay.

People are just oversensitive about the race issue.  Instead of
pretending we're all the same, we should all just learn to
appreciate each other and get along.  Not just ignore reality
and pretend we're all the same!
