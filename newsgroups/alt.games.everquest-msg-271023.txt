It removes even the risk of deaths and downtime.

Tell that to the enchanter I grouped with at 12th level, the one who 
nuked all his mana away and then stepped up with his club to tank. 
Yeah... he was learning all about being an enchanter.

Whats the poor bastard going to do when he hits level 30 when mobs hit 
for 40s and chew through his extra 800 hit points in 60 seconds? And the 
remaining 2000 or so in another couple minutes? 

Go back to PoK for a new temp ever 5 minutes? Rant that the game sucks 
because it has so much more downtime than it did at level 12? If he 
doesn't like to sit and he does like to solo a warrior he's just 
delaying hitting a solid wall.
