I've never tried duoing my monk and druid (as they're on the same
account), but each of them has occasionally duoed with others
playing the other class, and it's worked well.  The druid is a fine
soloer and duos well with most tanks, bringing healing, damage shield,
SOW, and other buffs, and eventually tracking, ports, etc.  And don't
forget evacs. :-)

If your son picks a tank that includes some healing (Paladin or BST),
you could consider a DPS class.  I haven't run my BST/WIZ duo for a
while, but we generally did fine (and again, had evac if things went
sour).  Mage would probably work also.  Biggest problem with many of
these combos is lack of crowd control and/or splitting techniques.

And as others have noted, you should expect to hit at least level 20
pretty quickly unless you're actively avoiding it.  And a couple of
hours of decent xp (e.g., LDONs) at level 20 is easily a level.
