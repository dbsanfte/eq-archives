They found a way to do that, it would seem. In the two event zones I
visited (WC and EK), you couldn't see any other players until you were
practically on top of them. Presumably this was done to reduce the
calculation load on the server.

Nice idea, except...

It contributed hugely to the KS problems during the event. You'd see
an untouched mob, run up, and whack it or cast on it, only to find
that you weren't the first person to attack it after all. And
naturally, tempers and shouts of KS were very hot.

Sadly, but not surprisingly, a huge number of people couldn't grasp
the concept that the KSing was largely (though not entirely)
unintentional. Any attempts to explain it to them were met with
accusations of supporting KSing.


I got my cool item on one of my first kills. I should have gone and
read a good book instead of playing after that.
