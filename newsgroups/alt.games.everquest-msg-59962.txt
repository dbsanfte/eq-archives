I don't know what game year the game started at, but I did figure out that 1
year in real life is 20 years in the game, based on the fact that 3 minutes
real life = 1 hour game time.

3 min RL = 1 hr EQ.
1 hr RL = 20hrs EQ.
18.25 days (or 438 hrs) RL = 1 year EQ.
1 yr RL = 20 years EQ.

If you hail one of the Paladin NPC's in North Freeport, he'll give you a
specific year when the Knights of Truth were on an anti-undead crusade on
the continent of Faydwer, and when Sir Lucan and the Freeport Militia took
over the town.  When I had hailed the NPC about six months ago, it had
already been about 50 years game time.  Since the game was about 2 years old
when I did that, it tells me that when the game started, the FP Militia had
been in charge of the city for about 5-10 years.  Now it's been something
like 60.

So it's probably a safe bet to say that the adventuring began, game time,
approximately 50 years ago.  Sometime around the year 3150?  That's based on
my assumption that EQ has been around for about 2 1/2 years.
