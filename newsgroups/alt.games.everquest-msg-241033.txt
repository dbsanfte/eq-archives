Not that I disagree with that sentiment but the Fabled J-boot neft
should have been seen coming by pretty much everyone. They were nerfed
on test almost as soon as they went live on the other servers. 

These fabled mobs do seem to bring back the <cough> good old days of
EQ;  lists, 24 hour+ camps and all that 'fun' stuff. Last night we
zoned into L Guk to get a mith 2 hander for a friend and the so called
raid camping Frenzy claimed all fabled mobs in the entire zone.
 ... not sure what their logic was, sometimes it's better just to
ignore the idiots than try to reason with them <g>. 

Rgds, Frank
