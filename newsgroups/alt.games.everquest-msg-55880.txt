Wasn't LoD, was AV.  They seem to be going for the server firsts more
than LoD.  I think LoD is hoping that Mischief finally gives some
decent loot, they seem to be there a lot.  I still see a random person
in The Pantheon, but looks like most went to AV, can anyone offer any
insight, rumor, gossip?  
Ewwww, sorry for the segue into guild weinie-wiggling, does lead to an
interesting question.  On Innoruuk, at least, the big european guild
is going to /movelog to the AB server, and rumor is that the big Asian
guild may go also.  If every server lost one powerful 55+ guild, would
AB turn into the true powerserver?  I can see things getting a bit
testy there, at least until SoL comes out.
