Thanks for the help with the ATI All in Wonder 128 video card.  I turned off
the sky in display and now there is no flickering on inventory.


Another newbie question. Is it something with my computer or does the music
cut out and "skip" for everyone? I have a Sound Blaster PCI 64. The music
sometimes sounds like it was playing on a record and was skipping... lol



Any ideas?
