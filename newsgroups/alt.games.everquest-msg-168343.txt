Naw, I think the only way to make PvP fair enough to be enjoyable is if it 
was restricted to only instances that were RP-appropriate.  But I'm not 
sure that's a soluble problem.  I wouldn't mind being hunted down by 
someone a jillion times more powerful than me, or an army of enemies, if 
it fit the plot because, say, I'd stolen something from them or slept with 
their best twink.  Or wouldn't stop begging for gear. :) But 
random ganking, even based on race, would get old really fast.

And strangely enough, for those cases where it's RP-appropriate, there's 
this clever thing called /duel.  And failing that, arenas.  It ain't 
perfect, but it seems like about the best you can do.  Ooo, what if, 
whenever you looted a mob some other party got the exp on, it would 
automatically consent to duels from those that got the exp... that might 
prevent a bit of ninjalooting. :)
