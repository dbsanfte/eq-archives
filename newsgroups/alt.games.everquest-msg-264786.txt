Not only that, he didn't even get hit, which means he doesn't get 
interrupted while trying to cast spells as long as the damage doesn't 
penetrate the rune.

Since its Enchanters, not Druids, who cast runes in EQ, this means they 
have a method for ignoring stuff beating on them while they try to land

This can be an expensive proposition, as most runes require expending 
gems, thought there -is- a line that doesn't.

My little ranger twink weilds a Polished Granite Tomahawk in his offhand 
(he isn't -very- twinked)  which procs a no component rune, which goes 
often often enough to effectively halve the damage he takes at his 
level... eventually he'll get to where the mobs are hitting so hard that 
it barely protects from one hit per proc
