Ahh a subject near and dear to my heart.
Ok my 2 coppers worth on this one.
First I never turn down payment for any service rendered I need the
money.
Second I always place amount of fare in the shout and ooc.
Third until you pay I aint going anywhere. Except CR.
Fourth I will SoW or buff before porting into areas know to be
dangerous. No additional charge for this just part of the service.
Fifth I will stay at Ring until you make it safely in the zone and if
needed fight to protect you to a point. I will not harm my faction
with Druids. I have however snared Griffs away from customers.
Sixth I owe you nothing. I have never begged for anything and always
paid for everything it wasnt always accepted but not my fault.
Sound harse? Too bad try getting decent loot in a group as a caster
now thats harse.
