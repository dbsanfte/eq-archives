Lance gave some good tips, but I would just add that you should look for a
Robe of the Oracle or an Advisor Robe.  On my server, either one of these
can generally be had for under 300pp.  For a necro, I would go with the
Advisor robe just because of the look,  a nice red, as opposed to the bright
blue (and golden nipple-stars) of the Oracle robe.  The stats on both robes
are similar, I can't recall exactly but you can look them up on Allakhazam's
and find out.  Both give INT and mana.
