I have a feeling that this might not be possible BUT.....

I have 2 characters in the same zone and on the same server. One of my
characters is reasonably well off. Is there anything to stop me buying items
with that character, then dropping the items in a secluded spot and then
logging in with my other character and letting him pick them up?

I know I would run the risk of somebody else getting the items before I
managed to pick them up but is it possible?

Cheers

John
