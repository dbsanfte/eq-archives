The paragraph above is a good reason against no-drop. Most of it will 
end up being destroyed anyway. Shouldn't tribute actually cost the 
person making the tribute something. No-drop is inherently worthless to 
everyone but the owner. A saleable item leaves the person to make a 
choice, do I realise the cash value for my own benefit, or do I give it 
to the guild either as an upgrade or a tribute.
