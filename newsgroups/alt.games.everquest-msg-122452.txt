I wa about to note that rule 11 is there again...

11. Names that contain sentences (Ikillorcs), phrases (Ontop), or two or
more words that do not form descriptive compound words (Petcarbob, Diediedie
and Tablechair). Descriptive compound words are allowed in first names and
are encouraged in surnames (e.g. Treehugger, Giantslayer). Descriptive
compound words (each separate part of the word and the entire word) must
otherwise adhere to all other naming rules.

Maybe they did get the message.
