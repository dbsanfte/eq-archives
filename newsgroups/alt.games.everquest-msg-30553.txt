I think you should be seeing more language choices to train from your
guildmaster as you advance. I'm pretty sure languages like Gnoll are
available at fairly low levels to rangers and druids out of Surefall which
makes a lot of sense because Blackburrow is so close. Should be easy to find
someone willing to teach you.

The down side is there are not a lot of reasons to use or use of languages
in game. I can only recall something like 4 scrolls that are part of a quest
written in Gnoll. You can read the bulletin boards with messages left in
different languages. I recall reading one message in Thieves Cant ~"Rouges
ROK! U SUK"<sic> which is representitive of most of the messages you find on
the Bulletin boards.
