Frankly, I'm not convinced this story is accurate. I was accepted into Phase
One of the EQ beta and even back *then* Verant provided CDs to everyone, and
then subsequently CDs for every new phase of the game (I still have all of
them). Most recently they provided beta CDs for Planetside and Star Wars
Galaxies and I have all of those as well. Why at this date would they
suddenly be unable to provide CDs for EQ2?
