<SNIP>, Dorn B'Dynn in North Ro (very, very
> green to me),
Dorn is one of the biggest undercons in the game, which  means he may be a
certain level but has the ac/hps/ resist's of a  higher lvl at level 30 my
enchanter  had a hard time with him at 34  it  got easier and now at  37
hes a cake walk but still resist's ALOT even after i debuff him

Droon in East Karana, and generic cyclopses in Rathe
> Mountains.
>   Interestingly enough, the giant skeletons in Rathe Mountains (which are
> blue to me) almost never resist anything I throw at them. Maybe it's an
> undead thing...
