Your mileage may vary. While setting the textures to "low" did indeed
improve my framerates (I have a GeForce 3 and a 1.2 Ghz Athlon), they
make the game look much worse for my taste, so much so that I put them
right back on "high" and just ate the framerate thing.

The problem with messing with the textures is that, while I only have
serious framerate problems in a few zones, like Luclin cities (Shar Val
is particularly bad in this), reducing the texture quality makes the
game look a lot worse in *every single zone*, including Old World zones
that already ran very smoothly indeed.

Of course, it all comes down to everybody's particular preference, looks
or FPS, and the trade-offs they are prepared to make for either.
