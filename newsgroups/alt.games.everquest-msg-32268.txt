Luckily, there is a learning curve effect.  If you don't make sure
you have your HP and AC buffs up, you die.  Then you lose
exp.  Soon, I'll level up past you and won't be grouping with
you anymore.
(end joke mode)

Seriously, if you don't care about your buffs, then don't come
crying to me when you get wiped out.  But I would rather
you live thru a fight, so I don't have to spend the mana resing
your sorry butt and then putting the buffs up again.  I'm all
about efficiency, and when groupmates die when they could
have lived, efficiency takes a hit.

Tanks that aren't concerned about their buffs, casters who
won't take the time to check on them (seconds, folks),
are either trained poorly (by self timers who make it their
job to keep track of everyone's buffs no matter how much
mana and time that wastes) or are Lazy.

I know I fall in the latter category.  Have I got my HP
buffs and SOW/Tboot up?  C2?  OK, then, anything
else I get is gravy...and I don't really tend to make a fuss
when it fades.

Here's what would help a lot: if alt would show buff names
when held down over the buff list, like it shows spell
names over that icon stack, and inventory names over
those stacks.  Since so many buffs have the same icons,
its hard for me to tell whats up and whats missing,
particularly when some party members are buffing me
on timers; Symbol fades and someone slaps a fire
resist on me while my attention is elsewhere, and I
see the same yellow shield in the same spot, wander
around down a very healthy chunk of HP till I think
to check it.
