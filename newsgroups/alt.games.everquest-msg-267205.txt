Of course. I just thought that was an apt description of your 'art'. :)

Quite right. As I said below:

Distribution/public broadcast same difference. I'm still leaning toward 
public broadcast, because distribution of one unit, the original unit 
you purchased wouldn't be enough. (Ie... if I bought a book mutilated it 
and sold it on ebay as art there would be no violation. I'm allowed to 
resell the book I purchased (even in its mutilated form), which I am 
doing.

A taped reading of the book isn't a book either. I'm not sure why you're 
reiterating this. We seem to agree.

Conceded. See below.

Conceded. See below.

Oh but it does really matter!

This tangent isn't a debate about the legality of IGE's position. Its a 
debate on DT's assertion that its a 'copyright violation'.

Possibly. Not exactly though. And there are counter examples along the 
same lines (e.g. NBA vs Motorola - re SportTrax pagers)

Conceded uncontested; but if you dig back into the archives I beleive 
you'll find a clause by clause discussion of the applicability of the 
various protections of copyright. Each of which were deemed irrelevant 
(though a court may decide differently -- but to date no cite has been 
provided to that effect).

In *this* thread, yes, I just breifly rehashed the main (and at that 
time primarily contested) clause... that actual copying was taking 
place. You may rest assured that the argument did include the other 
protections specified in the legislation.

Which again doesn't apply to the case at hand. 

At no point did I say there wasn't a valid case against IGE. I merely 
said it wasn't going to come from 'copyright'. DarkTyger has argued at 
length that it is, and we've reached an impasse, as far as I'm 
concerned.

You are wrong to assert I'm being narrow minded. If you have the 
inclination to dig back into the archived threads you'll discover that 
the point of contention was merely the applicability of copyright law to 
the situation. We've never closed the door on other options.

I have -all along- been of the opinion that SOE has legal avenues with 
which to pursue IGE. But copyright infringement would not be one of 
them.

I found your cites interesting. And I think there is an avenue along 
those lines, but its certainly not a clear cut win for SOE. SOE would 
have a tough time establishing that it was being damaged by IGE. Both 
financially or in terms of good will and reputation it would be an 
uphill battle.
