It is not an exploit.  If Verant wanted to make it impossible to MQ a quest,
they can do it by making you combine the nodrop items in a nodrop container
prior to turning it in.  They have quite a few quests that work this way,
thereby making those quests impossible to MQ.  You never know, but I don't
see them being likely to warn anyone for MQing a quest.
