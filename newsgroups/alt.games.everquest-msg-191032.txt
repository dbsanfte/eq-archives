There isn't one for a level 9.  Get some levels and save everything
you loot.  Learn to discriminate 'vendor trash' from items that you
can sell to other players.  Others have done a good job listing these.

Try these around level 13 or 14 IIRC.

Nothing more than the obvious.

Cash.  Save up 5 - 10 plat and buy a weapon in the bazaar.  Try to
find one that is magical.  Then pull out a calculator and divide the
damage by the attack delay.  The higher this ratio, the better.  For
now, just stick with a 1hs or 2hs weapons.  Do not buy any weapons
from non-player merchants.  You will pay 5-10 times as much for them.
