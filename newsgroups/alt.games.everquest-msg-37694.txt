On Mithaniel Marr, Daffydl Rosytoes (my wife's main character) is
selling a lot of pairs of imbued studded vale boots and a few of the
other pieces. I asked her about the reinforced, and she said that the
stats weren't really much better than studded and her success rate was
better. I don't know what her tailoring skill is other than it was
better than 120 a few days ago.
