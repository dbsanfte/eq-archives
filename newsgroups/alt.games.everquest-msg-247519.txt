The only items worth buying are the rare ones. If it were easy to
obtain.. it wouldn't be rare.. and therefore would have a lower price.
Baseball cards are a good example. What would happen if Topps looked
at their catalog and noticed that an uber-rare Mickey Mantle mint
condition rookie card that they put out in the 50's was going for 10
grand? Well shit... we're Topps... lets just put out exact replicas of
that card and rake in the money! These collector stores are getting
rich off our product, lets just make more of the high priced card and
sell! You see the problem. SoE is looking at their rares and wondering
why they can't sell them since they can generate them. The answer
should be obvious but i fear the glaucoma of green mist clouding their
eyeballs may make them see nothing else before it is way too late and
they remove all reason for playing the game. Oh well... sometimes
companies need to learn the hard way.
