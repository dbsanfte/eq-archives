I, like the others I've read so far, can't see anything "offensive"
about it. True, the surname is a compound word, but lenience is given
on those in surnames. I wouldn't worry much about having your name
nerfed, anyway. It's very rare that a level 60 will get their name
changed unless it was blatantly lewd or an unmistakable pop culture
referrence.
