What's the character generating system like? 3d6 thing or point based?
Personally I think they should go for point based system and have external
stats with it that you have to juggle points with, such as;
Hardware - Connection and PC speed/Reliability. Random rolls on LD's and
crashes as well as FPS loss.
Real Life - Does your job/otherhalf/social life interfere with your play

Plus, once a month the GM should get everyone to turn up as usual then stop
running the game after 10mins and state that it's an emergency patch...the
GM then starts the game 30mins before everyone would normally leave.
