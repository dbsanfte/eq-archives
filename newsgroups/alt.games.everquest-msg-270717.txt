I had heard that EQLive's numbers were a bit off.  So before I uninstalled
the client I thought I'd check for myself.  So I patched and logged in for
the first time in a month or so.

Let me preface this by saying I've played primarily on Cazic Thule my entire
EQ career, which dates back to March of 2001.  I've seen holiday dips come
and go.  I've seen new MMO games come and go.  I checked during the time of
day (mornings) that I normally played EQ, so my frame of reference is valid.
And as a last caveat, this is just for CT.  Your server's mileage may vary.

I'd heard it was bad, but I didn't know it was this bad.

Typically, you had to play Whack-A-Mole with the trader button in the bazaar
to get a slot, even at 550.  The last time I checked, which was about two
weeks after EQ2/WoW went live, there were just over 400 traders.  Today
there were 289.

My guild typically had around a dozen or so players online this time of day,
and over 900 listed in the guild tool.  The last time I checked, that was
holding steady, more or less.  Today there were three members online
(including me), and the total in the guild tool was around 650 (I didn't jot
down the exact number).  Our raid schedule had one Fear raid (which had been
cancelled) and two for "Target of Opportunity".

Typically there were about 90 - 100 in the PoK this time of day.  Last time
I checked there were about 70.  Today there were 38.

Now, I'm not doing the Chicken Little thing.  I don't think that EQLive is
going anywhere.  If they'll keep PlanetSide open, they'll keep EQLive open.
But I was kind of shocked at the actual numbers I found.
