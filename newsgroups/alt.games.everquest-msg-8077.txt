Why are you wasting points on agi?  The warrior stats are Stamina, AC and 
HP, in that order.

Str and Dex items are plentiful, you'll have no problem getting them up to 
acceptable levels from your items.

Dex is important in the early levels, up to the twenties, to keep the 2h 
blunt and 2h slash trained up to acceptable levels along with the 1hslash 
and 1hblunt, but it's not really necessary to put starting points in there, 
since Dex items are so common.

Str is important to any warrior, since your armor and weapons tend to be so 
heavy.  Ogres are probably the only race that actually start with enough.

All you need to do with Agi is make sure it's 75 or higher.  Once it's 75, 
you're fine.

My advice: the Ogre warrior is the best of all, statwise.  Put all the 
points you can into stamina, and the rest into Str or Dex, your choice (5 
one way or the other isn't going to be that significant).

Regen is nice for the first 20 levels, when you're soloing, but by the time 
you hit 20 you'll find yourself needing to group - soloing post-20 for 
warriors is the pits.  When you're in a group with a cleric, regen becomes 
nearly irrelevant.

I will say that the size factor can be a bit of a barrier for the Ogres.  
There are certain dungeons where you'll require the services of a shaman 
(for their Shrink spell at level 19) or shrink potions (made by Shamans 
with Alchemy).  For example, you can't get into Sol A at all without a 
shrink.

One thing I will please ask you to do whether you choose Troll or Ogre: be 
sure to choose Rallos Zek as your religion!  There is some very nice 
player-made stuff now that can only be worn if you are worshiping an 
entity, so don't chose agnostic.

One more piece of advice, for items - AC is king above all (except possibly 
for the rare stamina item).  If one item has 3 AC and 10 dex, and the other 
has 10 AC and nothing else, take the high AC item every time.
