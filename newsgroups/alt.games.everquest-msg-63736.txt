Not sure what SoL has for the ubers, it *was* marketed as newbie to mid
level continent/satellite, whether it will be like kunark and have newbie to
high level zones I've no idea (paid little attn to SoL's release, haven't
even ordered it) but I expect they'll have bigger and better things
available, as always. Just don't expect the prices to drop straight away,
need the market to be flooded with the old first, then you'll see the
Lammy's and JM's for 6k.

As for Armour over Weapons, obviously not as much fun for you but definitely
a priority, I assume you are wearing nearly all crafted but you haven't
mentioned what weapons you are currently swinging so I don't know what to
judge against. 10k will buy you a pair of Cobalts Boots and Gaunts (actually
8k will do that on Bristlebane) the whole 20k would easy get you Boots,
Gaunts and Arms with a few thousand to spare. Weapon wise I'd wait, if you
can afford to, give SoL a month into it's release, then see if you can't get
the Boots, Gaunts and pair of decent (if last years model) weapons for your
20k.

At the moment Armour is my priority, slightly behind you at 51, my 1hdr's
are far from uber (both 10/22's) I do better (drop mobs faster) with my
2hder but I have a few of weak spots in my armour to give me extra stats
(Stam, Str and MR) and these need sorting out for me and this is where I
intend to spend plat next. This is clear cut for me but I am not the main
tank in my guild and rarely do raids (I can easily play for 5hrs solid but
playing for 5hrs solid +4hrs waiting for ppl to sort their lives out I have
had enough of) so I don't need to balance dam output for aggro and AC for
tanking.

Wouldn't bother with an FBSS over armour, myself but, if you can get a good
deal on the Cobalt (BB, current, prices Gaunts 3k, Boots 5k, Arms 8k) then
an FBSS for your waist (losing 8 - 10 AC which really equates to 12 - 15AC)
would give you a boost to your current 1hdrs. Another expansion should, once
again, knock the price even lower on the FBSS, currently around 6k expect
5's and 4's buy the new year.

Have fun shopping
