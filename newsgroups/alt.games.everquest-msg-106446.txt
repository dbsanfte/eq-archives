Well... that's kinda rediculous, too.
it's not called "zone chat" so people can chat about the zone... it's there
so people can do a zone-wide message for all to see.
"Out Of Character" (so basically, I use ooc to ask questions as ME, not my
character).
And, the conversation started as a simple question to everybody.  I don't
see the harm in that...
If I'm trying to talk to somebody in /ooc and others start up, I generally
take it to a /tell to finish up the conversation, but sometimes I don't.  I
just don't see what the big deal is.
it's not like /ooc is huge, bold red letters screaming across your chat
window...
