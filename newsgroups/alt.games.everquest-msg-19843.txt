Actually Biz, read to the bottom of the page.


"If you attempt to transfer characters in violation of these guidelines and
restrictions, any laws, the EUASL or the Rules of Conduct(for instance,
attempting to transfer characters from another person's account or to or from
an account purchased by or for you or given to you where you are not the
original registered user of that account), the characters will not be moved,
your request will not be processed or approved and your account(s) will be
subject to review and appropriate disciplinary action taken"

So, unless the same person is listed as the original owner of both accounts,
they're going to refuse to transfer the character, and probably ban the
account.

So much for getting the roommate / family member / ex wife / whatever off your
account....
