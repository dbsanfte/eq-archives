Never forget that "one at a time" part.  Whenever you move on to new mobs,
or anything else changes that might affect your ability to quad, always
start with a single mob.  That way, if you find that it has too many HP, or
it resists too often, or whatever, you are left low on mana with just one
mob to deal with, instead of four.

Also, keep in mind that you don't have to quad.  If there is not any
competition for the mobs where you are fighting, quadding might just leave
you sitting around waiting for respawns.  If you can keep up with the
respawn rate killing them one, two, or three at a time instead of four, I'd
not quad.  Why take more risk for no more reward?
