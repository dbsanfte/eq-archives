Hi konw this probably isnt the best place to ask but i figure many EQ players
have quite a knowledge of computers so maybe someone can help me with my
problem.  OK, I have a realtek 8139 network card (current drivers installed)
and connect with a cable modem, now the problem i have is that i cant get any
connection to the internet or anything to wrok but when i right click on it and
hit status it says it is connected. I have called my local cable company but
they could not help and want to charge me like $150 for a tech to come out and
do it when i feel it is something real easy and i just cant figure it out.
Please ehp its been 4 months since i last played and they keep charging me for
legends and i cant get on to change it since they want all kinds of info for me
to do so by email and im afraid ive lost it all since ive been laying since
release and dont have my orig account # ( yes im an idiot).

thank you
