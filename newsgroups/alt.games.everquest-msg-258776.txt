Bah, 20 mana a tic is better than 14 per tic.  It's enough of an
improvement to make the health loss worth it.  So you have to tap
every two fights...that's also more DPS you're doing.  In any case,
when he gets Demi Lich there is no going back to Chanter buffs.  As
for my Necro, I never once intentionally got a clarity buff, I always
had something better than what could be cast on me.
