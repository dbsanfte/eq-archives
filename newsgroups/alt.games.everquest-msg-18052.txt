	I'm personally of the opinion that anyone who says "you don't
like twinking because you're jealous" is insecure and trying to
compensate.

	Believe it or not, there are a lot of folks out there who
object to twinking out of reasons that have nothing to do with
jealousy.  When I was anti-twink, it was because I felt that it breaks
fiction.  (I still feel that it breaks fiction.  I'm just not bothered
by it anymore.  I've accepted the game on its own terms, not on mine.)

	Of course, after playing for two years, I'm no longer
anti-twink.  I long ago stopped worrying about whether or not other
people twink, so seeing a Level 2 Warrior in full cobalt and wielding
a 14/24 sword doesn't bother me.

	For my own alt characters, I like to learn how to play the
class without the crutches provided by heavy twinking.  It's easy to
taunt as a warrior if you've twinked over a couple of Jade Maces.
It's a bit more difficult to maintain taunt with two Langseax.
Learning how to do it with the two Langseax will make you that much
better at it when you finally *do* get your Jade Maces.  So when I
create an alt, I never twink over more than a full suit of visual
leather, a fine steel weapon, and 25pp or so.
