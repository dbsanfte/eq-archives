Wow.

As I recall the exp table formula the level based term was (level^^3).
This gives L18 requiring 1.42 times the exp to get thru that L16 does.
Add to this the pair of (small) exp deaths, and the fact that some of
the mobs had gone light blue (reduced exp award), and the reduced
number of kills, suggests that your lizard was getting somewhere near
1.5x the exp per kill post patch.  That's nuts, was already easy to
get quickly to L20 untwinked for experienced player, or for a twinked
novice for that matter, now it doesn't even require noticeable effort.

Another anecdote, L7 fighting in Blackburrow:
2 blues per even con, 3-1/2 blues for the one yellow con I fought.
And, of course, when I dinged 8 with my cleric I simply charged into
the midst of a nearby train so I could gate back to Qeynos to sell off
and train Meditate, instantly regaining all my mana as a bonus.  Nice
of Verant to put the Qeynos soulbinder right next to the bank.

**********************************************************************
Next Patch:
The spellbook has been entirely removed, all casters now have 25 banks
of spell gems, once a spell is scribed it is permanently memorized.
Also, the following special commands have been added:
1) typing <ctrl-z> followed by "fast" will give your character a 40
percent movement boost along with 60 percent melee attack haste and
40 percent casting time reduction.
2) typing <ctrl-z> followed by "zilla" summons a pet dragon five
levels higher than your character that behaves as a mage/necro pet.
Both "fast" and "zilla" modes are usable by any class/level, of course.
Additional special mode commands are being evaluated, as always we
encourage your feedback.

The Mollycoddle Team, er, um, that is, Everquest Team
