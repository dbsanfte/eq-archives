But for the stuff they make, or is it because they want to get their 
skills up for quests?  And the people selling trade skill stuff, are 
they selling because people are using it to make stuff, or because they 
are using -it- for skillups for quests?

Vaguely.  Why haven't I seen it in the bazaar?  You say there are lots 
of trade skillers, and you could sell it for far less than comperable 
dropped weapons are going for... so where is the thing?

I admit that I dropped out of tradeskilling many years ago, back when 
they changed the trivial level of FS plate.  Back then it was impossible 
to Give away any weapon you could make blacksmithing.  While I'm aware 
that there are now substantially better player made weapons, I had the 
vague sense that the "you can't give it away at cost" line still applied 
to most of it.

I did see some Black Acrylia stuff in the bazaar, so at least I can 
confirm that someone is trying to sell the stuff...

I'm particularly gleeful about the "oops I shouldnt' have gone KOS in my 
home town" crowd, but then I'm the kind of person who wishes that LDoN 
hadn't given those people alternative places to go to get their 
adventurer stones either.

I didn't say crit 2% of the time, I said 2% of damage output from crits. 
  Is that the same thing?  The figure I heard was that at the high end, 
people do 2.5% of their damage from crits.  I rounded down on the 
assumption that most people aren't at the high end, and 2% was easier to 
type.

I'm not sure why FT is so much more restricted than HP regen, 
actually... but I suspect the same, its much more in keeping with their 
policy of keeping the lid on the mana tank screwed on as tight as they can.

Hmm, yes they are indeed.  In which case, nerfing the FT regen down to 
one point per level will itself be out of proportion, the same way I 
thought this was :)

I didnt have any luck doing this at all, not because I didn't have the 
skill, but because the components were as rare as the spells were... or 
rarer, because you needed to get parts A B and C for a given spell, so 
you ended up with bank slots stuffed with parts waiting for mates.  On 
the few occaisions when I managed to put a set together, the friend I 
was making the spell for had managed to buy the spell in bazaar before I 
got to him, and I'd sit there looking at components selling in bazaar 
for more than the spell did!

Which, by the way, makes Research sound like a typical trade skill to me.

There's a pretty obvious benefit to dual weilding: twice the stats.  I 
guess at the high end of the game, people are capped on stats and don't 
care, but I don't generally see twice the str, twice the hp, twice the 
mana, etc, on comperable two handers as on one handers.

Also, with buff/debuff proccing items, you don't lose as much of your 
overall DPS equipping one till it procs; when I gear up my two handed 
practice sword my DPS drops in half till it goes off; doing something 
comperable while dual weilding would only take about a quarter of your 
DPS, if that, because you can keep the proccer in off hand.

I don't see why dual weilding should be an advantage over 2 handers 
overall, anymore than I see why the reverse should be true; I'd think 
they should be roughly equivalent, and one should be better than the 
other only on a situational basis.
