They are experiencing huge pressure.  Look at whats happened with EQ in the
past 2-3 weeks:

Massive patch with upgrades of some sort to every single class, even if
some the changes are just smoke and mirrors like making select NPCs less
resistant, while jacking the HPs of the mob at the same time.

Roleplaying and Euro server.  Two things that they had said they wouldnt do
in the past.

Soliciting CS feedback on the Station.

McQuaid leaving.

Whether its DAoC or not, Sony/EQ is definitely feeling pressure or seeing
profits and/or subscriptions dry up.
