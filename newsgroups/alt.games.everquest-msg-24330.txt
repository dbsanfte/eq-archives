I've seen this on my laptop when the battery indicator would flash that I
was outta juice.
I think your mouse issue comes from whenever anything in the background
tries to take the focus away from EQ for something.
Try shutting down everything that is running in the background. Anti-virus,
Instant Messaging, MS Scheduler, etc...
Also, despite the fact that EQ installs DX7 and it may seem to work ok, it's
always a good idea to have the latest ver of DX. You can d/l it from:
http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/downloads/default.asp

That's the page for us home type users. Hope that helps!
