}Depends...  Are you going to start viscious attacks on my wife and
}kids??

Given that he specifically said he disapproved of that practice, I'd say 
it's pretty unlikely, wouldn't you?

}>I also did not say that you
}>would cause me direct "great harm" from the postings.  Claiming that
}>*posts* themselves cause harm is your beef.  I worry about opinions
}>and attitudes, you know, all that "PC" stuff you deride but don't know
}>anything about.   I gave many examples of this, which you ignored-
}>probably because you could not find a substantive reply.
}Seems that is your gambit.. I have made point after point re: your
}inconsistent attitudes..

Well, you've tried, but I haven't seen you actually establish a point of 
that nature yet.

}Your response has been, to a T.....   
}"I did not say that"
}W/o providing ANY factual basis to back it up..

I'm afraid the onus lies on you to prove he -did- say it, without twisting 
his words to mean whatever you think they shoud mean.  Given that he 
didn't say it, though, that could be quite a challenge.

}While it might not be word for word what you said, the meaning is
}clear..

Only if we use 'EQ's Very Special Dictionary of What Words Really Ought to 
Mean for his Convenience'.

}Much like the meaning was clear re: that Lesa post.. Everyone got it
}but her. 
}And THAT is because she did not WANT to get it..  

She never said she didn't get it, she said she wasn't sure, and would like 
clarification before answering.  Clarification which you resolutely 
refused to provide.

}If she got it, she would have to address it.  But she couldn't address
}it w/o admitting that her posts make her out to be a hypocrite...

Actualy, her posts didn't make her out to be a hypocrite at all, and 
you've yet to provide evidence to the contrary.

}So it is with you.  
}Within the same post, you say that USENET posts are irrelevant in the
}real world and can cause "little or no harm".
}Then 2 paragraphs you claim that you would be happy to ignore me, but
}I can make your life harder by my USENET postings.. (lemme get your
}EXACT words and see you weasel out of it...) 
}"I said, I'd be happy to ignore you, but ignorant idiots like you make
}it harder for me to enjoy my life."

You'll note,in the excerpt you quoted, the difference between the phrases 
'ignorant idiots like you' and 'you'.  you will also note a total absence 
of reference to USENET.  Try again.

}Ergo, you won't mind me continuing my USENET crusade, right???   :^)
}Go ahead... Yer allowed to weasel and waffle now..

Oh, but you're so much better at it.  why don't you show us how weaseling 
and waffling is really done by a real professional?

}>> Geeeeee.... Let me think on that one....
}>I wish you would.  You didn't even bother to reply to any point in my
}>post, although you did invent some of your own.   LOL.     In case you
}>missed it:

Funny how you didn't say anything after this point, EQ.  Should we 
conclude from that that everyone gets it but you, and THAT is because you 
don't WANT to get it?
