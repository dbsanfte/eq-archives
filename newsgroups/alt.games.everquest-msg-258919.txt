The basic answer is no. If you are like <<10 you might as at very low
levels you can still get xp from just green mobs and may get archery
skillups though I'd guess they will be few and far between.

Best bet is to practice archery on dark blues and higher. Take up
fletching for you will use an awful lot of arrows -- use the cheap
ones to shoot, sell back the expensive ones, you will find out what I
mean :). Root and shoot is the usual tactic as well as snare and bow
kite. Damage is relatively laughable at low levels but it can be done.

I did root and shoot in my mid 20's on Aviaks in South Karana. I maxed
(140) my skill for my level (archery was about 40 when I started
that). Took several trips and a lot of arrows.
