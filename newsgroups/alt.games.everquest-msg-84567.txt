If I have Zone Alarm installed I can't log in to EQ. I get throught
the Sony screen, the Verant screen, the little movie, click on the
connect button, enter my name and password, click on connect, and then
am promptly dumped to desktop. Killing Zone Alarm and associated
processes doesn't help. I have to literally uninstall it to get any
game time (and it does work). Has anyone else run into this? Does
anyone else know of a solution?

Running AMD Athlon "Classic" 700
Win XP
