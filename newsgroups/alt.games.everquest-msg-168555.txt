U.S. conservatism, ie J.C. Watts.

Yes, but worrying about statistically insignificant deviants bogs the
discussion down, so we may skip over them, and deal with the views as as
whole.

You can't use dictionary definitions in this debate.  If you take the modern
liberal's views, they tend towards fascism.  If you take the modern
moderate's views, they tend towards the conservative.  If you take the
modern conservative's views, they tend towards classical liberalism.  Using
dictionary definitions only confuses the issue when describing modern
political movements.
