Grim forest is a helluva expensive port tho, costs double mana. The luclin
ones can be daunting if you don't have kei. I think Kei is the everquest
version of Spice.

But yes, I love the place. Only downside is it's theoretically dangerous as
someone could build a huge train and swamp the guards, but i've never seen
it, the guards are tough. Has anyone else? whereas i don't think a lot of
druids porting to misty have much to fear! And nexus and bazaar are safe;
can't seem to so much as stub a toe in the bazaar.
