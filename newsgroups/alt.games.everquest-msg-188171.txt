1. The resolution does NOT allow for the (pretty much unilateral) war that
Bush says he will start.
2. The resolution does say that "serious consequences" will follow if Iraq
fails to disarm to the criteria in Resolution 687.
3. Iraq has complied with 687, therefore no "serious consequences" should
follow.
4. Stop watching Fox "News" and you might get a clue.
