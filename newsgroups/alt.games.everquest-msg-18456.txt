I wish my character got experience from experiences like that. Despite
being a dual pointy-thing wielding DE Rogue who's almost never
anon/roleplay, I've been asked for:

1. Sow
2. Binds
3. Clarity
4. Gift of Magic
5. Cleric buffs

And just the other day someone asked me to group with him thinking I was
a Paladin. And Enchanters, bless 'em, often clarity/breeze me thinking
I'm a Shadowknight, which at least is marginally understandable.
