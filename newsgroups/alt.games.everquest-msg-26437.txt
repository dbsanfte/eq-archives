    Six levels can make a HUGE difference. In addition to the time that six
levels represents for someone who has no powerlevelling available, the level
60 was part of our server's best guild and had all the toys from VP, ToV
etc. to go with that. He even kept the droppable stuff like his Lodizal
Shell Shield on the character. I've seen folks pay crazy cash for that
shield alone.
