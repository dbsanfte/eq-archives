A lot of you might remember me venting some steam about camping for A
Glowing Black Stone, dropped by that Necro Gnome skank Pyzjn in Qeynos
Hills, and my frustration at not being able to get one.

Well, here's a follow-up:

Since that rant, I spent about three more hours camping the ruins, without
her spawning even once. That was a couple of weeks ago.

A couple of days later, I was heading from Qeynos to Surefall Glade to use
the teleporter to Jaggedpine so I could go buy some Cheese. (I used PoK to
get to Qeynos) As soon as I zoned in, I saw Tovax Vmar walking around, so I
stayed out of his aggro range and followed him around. He stopped a couple
of times and each time he paused for about a minute and started walking
again. The last time he was near the road and close to a tree a short
distance from the Miller's campfire, dropped the note, and ran off instead
of walking. I waited a few minutes and Pyzjn spawned and headed for the spot
where he dropped the note (I think it had disappeared, since I didn't see
the small bag icon on the ground).

I nuked her, and she didn't drop the GBS.....of course. =(

HOWEVER....

A couple of nights ago, I bought a GBS from a trader in the Bazaar.....for
350pp! (And I had just sold about a lot of food I had made to a member of my
guild for 400pp while we were both in PoK a few minutes before, so I still
came out ahead)

No more camping Pyzjn for me! =)
