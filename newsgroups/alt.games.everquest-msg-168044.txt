Well, when I went, I was around lvl 52 and I was with a 60 monk.  I succored
and got immediate agro.  I died fast.  Thank god there was a cleric right
there with clicky rezz that helped me.  But then he rezzed me.. got agro
again so i zoned.. when I zoned into WW it put me in the "safe spot" of the
zone.. which for me at the time was not at all safe.. I was very kos to
dragons because of guild killing woushi, gore, and killing in CS. so I died
in there right away.  So I succored across one more time and looted my body
and was lucky to not get agro (the monk finally got smart enough and killed
the mob that was there).

Never got to donate to that nice cleric.. but he probably felt bad cause I
could not go get my body in WW.  so I lost about 450pp that was on my
corpse.. oh well. live and learn lol.

What I suggest is.. just be ready for aggro.. I wasn't . I thought I had a
60 monk with me.. so I'm ok.  So, regen, and skin yourself and hopefully you
should be ok.
