No, but there are supposedly going to be single player or smaller group 
instanced zones in the future.

I also wish for solo LDoN. It is almost impossible to get groups there these 
days, especially if you're not an American. Sure, I could move to a Euro 
server, but my friends are all on RN and I get to play with them later in 
the day. It would be nice to see more solo options for melee classes when 
others aren't around.

My Paladin is 58 and I find it hard to play in anything other than a planes 
group.
