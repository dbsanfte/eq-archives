Actually its bang on topic. The subject was the point of everquest.
You alleged it was to take down the biggest mobs... clearly there are
other objectives players can have.

What offtime?

Procedure calls suit you better? Nah... I prefer macros... the
difference between a macro and traditionally programmed function is
precisely the limited ability of the thing to *be* robust. Macros are
inherently more sucseptible to failure.

We're arguing two separate issues here. And your mixxing them
together.

1) The facility of duping Sony into not detecting that you are running
a bot army.

I'm willing to concede you this one to a point.

2) The facility of creating a bot army that will can be controlled by
high level generic commands. (And ideally as one that would respond
well enough that it would look like a human run raid to a outside
observer who merely observes it.)

This one I'm a long way from accepting as trivially easy. Moving even
the human-ness out of it... just getting a raid bot army to behave
competently is a much larger project then you've given credit for.
Unless your idea of a raid is the Kunark ones you mocked earlier...
with a MT up front, and everyone else at the back until its time to
call Nuke... then yeah a bot army could probably manage it just fine.
