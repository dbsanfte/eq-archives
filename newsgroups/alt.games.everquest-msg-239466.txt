I don't know if you tried AO since Shadowlands, but that's the place to be a
newbie (at least for your first character).  I'd highly recommend
downloading that version of the software (it's a gig+ ... it took me almost
24 hours via broadband, but it all made it).

The newb garden in SL is much like an EQ newb garden (it kind of reminded me
of Misty Thicket without the wall), and there's a series of quests there
that all start with a NPC named Drake Rodriguez.  Each quest results in
something tangible that can be useful into your late teens / early 20's, and
you'll practically trip over Drake from the moment you get to Jobe.

Once you hit about 10, you can move through the city to the other side for
more EQ-reminiscent hunting, or go down to the planet and hit the mission
terminals (which is what I did ... it's pretty obvious where the SOE dev
team got the idea for LDoN).  If EQ had a solo LDoN NPC in each camp the way
that AO has soloist mission terminals, I'd be a happy camper.

It has it's quirky little bugs (every so often a mission gets hosed, and
there have been a couple of times when zoning didn't take and I've had to
back up and try again), but as I'm sitting here typing I can honestly say
that I've never gone LD playing AO.  I'm not sure how they've built the comm
aspect of their client, but it sure seems sturdy enough.

If you decide to give it a whirl and start a character on Rimor, let me
know. ;-)
