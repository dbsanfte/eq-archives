Well, I've explained it several times, as well as I can.  I KNOW I'm not the
only one that feels this way...

Let me try another anaolgy...

Suppose in the PoK, they put an NPC that would give you a level appropriate
ress you back to your body for free.  Anyone that had purchased the POP
expansion could, anytime they died, go up to the PoK, and get a free Res of
whatever level you happened to be when you got there.

Now, have the Clerics lost anything?  No, they can still res, and if they
happen to be in the party, it will still be more convenient for them to do
the res, than for the player to run all the way up to Nexus.  The only thing
the Clerics would lose is the "res for plat" that some of them do.  Most
people would rather run their corpse to a safe place, and then go up to the
PoK than pay...

Would it ruin their ability to find groups?  No, like many here have said,
grouping depends on more than how much you can give everyone, it also
depends on how well the people know you and like you.

Would the Cleric class be ruined?  No, they are still very useful, and they
are still the best healers in the game.

Would the Clerics be upset?  You bet they would, or at least MANY of them
would!  A key feature of their class has just been reduced in value
drastically!

Now if they complained, would you tell them that they hadn't lost anything?

Would you tell them that if people only grouped with them because of their
res they must be pretty poor groupers?

Would you say that the changes were good for many of us that died and no
clerics were around (like happened to me two days ago)?

Would you claim that they should be happy for us unless they were only
concerned about ressing for plat?

Would you say "Look, this is great for you, nobody will be bugging you for a
res anymore!"?

This is identical to OUR situation, except that we don't even have the
consolation of being the best at healing in a group.  We aren't the best at
ANYTHING, so when one of the abilities is made less necessary, we feel the
sting even more.

<shrug>  Maybe you WOULD tell the complaining cleric all of the things
above, maybe you DO think this would be a good idea, even if they didn't
give the cleric some ability to make up for the lost utility of his res
spell.  If so, then I can see how you would fail to understand my
objections.

If you DON'T think this would be a good thing to do without compensating the
Clerics with another ability, then can you see how this is equivelant to our
situation?
