What's at the core of the problem, if I read it correctly, is that a few, a very 
few people have had their 6th anniversary promotion deal of $99US per year, 
renew automatically, while most saw their renew date pass without renewal, then 
go on for a few days and finally terminate on a weekend. Sony then claimed that 
the player had canceled the account, so were required to pay at the new price 
structure. Being a weekend, they had no recourse if they wanted to play as 
Customer Service was not there. Also, anyone changing expiration dates on credit 
card info was considered to have canceled their accounts thus losing the $99 deal.

I had the $99 deal, but I have canceled my account, due to run out on June 10, 
so this doesn't affect me at all other than further confirming that I won't be 
playing Vanguard if a company with ethics like these are "publishing" it and 
doing the billing.
