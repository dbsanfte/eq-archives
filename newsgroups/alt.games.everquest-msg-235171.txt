This is true.

However the slow/hast portion of a song is fixed and is NOT
amplificated. Just check a couple of threads in the songs section at
www.eqdiva.com. It is stated there a number of times.

Btw, I don't use Amp at all. Depending on the situation I twist 3 or 4
sometimes even as low as 2 Songs. Since Amp is on another timer than
the rest of the bard songs it will confuse my timing. And I hate it
when a crucial song drops because of that. I like better doing a solid
twist than doing a superb twist sometimes. :P
