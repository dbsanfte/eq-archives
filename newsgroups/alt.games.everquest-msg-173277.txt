    Hrm? I'm not trying to rag on anyone. Those two weapons rock, and up
until very recently it was the best weapon combo in game for monks. His
getting it is quite an achievement. As for the "Your spell did not take
hold", I was honestly curious what spell wasn't taking hold since it's
happening like a million times in his log. I assumed it was the epic effect
from his gloves, since that doesn't stack with Vallon and I saw someone cast
Vallon on him at one point, but I wanted to make sure.
