More than not casting it. =)
Plus, the shorter duration of BoP makes it more group friendly.

The amount of grief-play on three of the four Zeks is vastly over-rated.

Extra damage from highly buffed strength is negligable. Extra damage from 10
strength is so vanishingly small it may as well not exist. Just FYI. =)

Brain thought 'Heart Flutter', but fingers typed 'Disease Cloud'

I used to be broke all the time, then I skilled up tailoring so that leather

That won't happen. If aggro on dots is nerfed, then shaman, druids and
necros would get a lot more powerful.

Feign Death, Gather Shadows, new pet, new lifetap and the first non-darkness
dot. Fear, when we first get it) uses up way too much mana to be effective,
IMO - it only starts becoming useful levels later.

Mental Corruption = no need for KEI.
OK, slight exaggeration, but not by that much. =)
