I realise that iksars are kos to the guards. Three questions please:-

One, is there any way of improving the faction with them?

Two, what is the route the patrolling goons take when they leave the
outpost?

Three, are there ANY merchants an iksar can trade with outside of Cabilis?

To put the questions in context, I have a 22nd level iksar beastlord and
pretty much only solo him, so I'm looking for good hunting ground not too
far away from merchants. I'd also like to go to the Bazaar but that seems a
bit of a nightmare, ok to get a port there but getting back at my level
could be a problem I guess...

Thanks for any advice!

Loremaster
