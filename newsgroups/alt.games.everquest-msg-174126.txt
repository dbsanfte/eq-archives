They are used for some of the newbie armor quests... but you are better 
off selling them to a vendor. I tried having them on a bazaar mule for a 
plat, and had no takers.

I got a stack of each as my necro cleaned out the gnolls for faction. I 
may be the only necro who can port visible into Surefall Glade and any 
where in the karanas. Not sure about WC, I haven't hunted enough in 
Kithicor for that.
