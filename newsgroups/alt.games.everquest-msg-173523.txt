Aye, because a druid cannot call his healing an efficient use of mana on a 10K+ hp mob, soloing
your pets are definately disposable.  Still, DS does a lot of damage in one fight against an
unslowed opponent, mana per mana I bet DS would be your best way of adding damage to the fight
(other than no mana cost DOTs).   Haste... well your pet already has extraordinary DPS, hasting
him means his DPS gets even better.

I'm not sure casting either makes sense without a healer option, as you note, the pet is
certainly disposable, perhaps charm snare and root are the only things worth spending any mana
on at all, and clicky DOT if you want things to move along faster.

With a cleric partner, buffing the pet becomes a serious option, since he's much easier to keep
alive with a 400 mana 7500 heal; now his higher DPS and his DS really have time to pay off.

A TRAIN hotkey is easy to make, you don't even have to really hotkey it, as you can put it in
socials and leave socials up on that page, a single click (a trifle harder than slapping a
hotkey) will announce the fact that you are training to zone line and of course at least a
guess as to whats on your tail (%T)

Many people will complain loud and long about an announced train as well.  Personally, I've
thought about this a lot, and decided that they are wrong, zoning is a game feature well worth
using, and hanging out near zone lines is a convenience that comes with risk of trains
announced and unnanounced.  At least mine are announced.

As my main is a cleric, I'm very aware of what risks a cleric rezing people entails.. which is
to say, practically none at all.  Rez is a very long range spell, believe it or not, I don't
have to be anywhere near the zone out in PON to rez bodies in the graveyard.  Further, rezing
does not in any way force me to stand still.  During the process of casting a rez, should I see
or "hear" danger approching, I'm more than capable of moving, blows the res, but even without
my clicky there's no mana spent if I cancel a spell by moving while casting.

Further, its my job to keep an eye open for movement while casting, and cancel rez if it looks
like danger for you even though I personally may be well out of range.

There are a few seconds of massive vulnerabilty just after a rez, I'll grant you.  This is
unfortunate.  This can be minimized by A) zoning in before rez; this way you don't have the
zone in delay between when you accept and when you arrive  B) Zoning in before rez; this way
you can take a look around before accepting  C) Don't loot up even if you did zone in before
rez; this way you are unencumbered and can actually hope to move at least at moderate speeds
D) After rez move out of the maximum danger zone, up the hill or to the zone stone in this
instance.

Occaisionally this will fail nonetheless.  This is a sad fact of EQ; getting a rez is risky
business.  You risk a second death, you win a massive rebate of lost exp off your first death.
If Sony didn't want it this way, they could have made you invulnerable for a few seconds post
rez, or at least not stolen most of your HP and reduced your STR to near zero.  Ipso facto, the
risk is intentional.  Similarly, graveyards make CRs largely a thing of the past, but
graveyards with zone outs located in them make trains on rez a much higher risk... my thinking
is, this too is intentional.

I agree, there's no reason at all to train THRU the graveyard in PON, although people do.  In
POJ, there's absolutely no excuse for this, as zone out is nowhere near the GY.  In POI, its
nigh unavoidable.   In POD, if you just to right ahead and zone out you'll never train the GY
itself, but people who -reach- the GY with no visible pursuit and stop, thinking they "lost"
their pursuit have a rude awakening coming, and nasty things will happen to the unsuspecting
people hanging out in the generally safe haven.  Lets see, POV zone out is actually quite a
ways from zone in and GY proper, although it is in the same "Graveyard" area, no excuse for
training here.  POS zone out... long ways to run, but if you dont path along the coast, even
running only slightly ahead of your pursuit won't train anyone with half a brain in their
(virtual) bodies.

Most druids I know use SOW rather than SOE, they say there's less lag and less irritating
movement this way, so unless they are in zones where falls are a problem, they tend to use
SOW.  Personally, I always prefer SOE to SOW, longer duration and no falling damage whenever I
do happen to descend rapidly.

Number of wolves running around in zones I frequent has been dropping every month, despite the
fact that the zones I'm in have been getting higher and higher in level.  There do seem to be
substantial benefits to FotH... oh wait, I bet I know why.  Horse.  Mana regen on a horse far
outweights that of FotH if you spend a lot of time on your feet.  I have models set up in such
a way that I don't see horses, so I can't say if this is the cause of this oddity, but its a
possibility.  Isn't there also a spell Mask of the Howler that gives the mana regen benefits
without being tied to SOW?  Hmm, and of course SOE and FotH conflict too, don't they?  So
druids who actively want levitation without constantly having to cast yet another spell (and
use bat wings if they dont' have the dramatically overpriced no wing lev spell) end up in their
natural form after all.

But those are just suppositions on my part.
