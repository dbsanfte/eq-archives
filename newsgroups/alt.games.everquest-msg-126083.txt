That's the belief of the officers in my guild, too.  They operate that the AC is on a
3 hour timer.  The strategy when we go is to kill everything on the sand until he
spawns (especially the crypt mummies), and then when he does spawn, come back in
another 3 hours.  I dunno.  I vote for the "random spawn" theory myself, but I'm not
about to rain on anyone's parade, especially if they are letting me roll on the ring.
