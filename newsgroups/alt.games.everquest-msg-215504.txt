*shrug*  Maybe you wouldn't care.   And often times, nothing will happen.
But every so often, the stars align and it all becomes worthwhile.   (I
don't keep an actual list usually, but I have a very long memory for people
that piss me off.)

And let me tell you, theres no feeling quite like the one you get explaining
to a shadowknight in /say (even though he's desperately trying to move it to
/tells)  that yes, you do have an open group spot, and no, he won't be
getting it.   That you don't appreciate people who set up their camp
immediately behind you and pull mobs way over their head... then just dump
the extra ones on your group when they get too many.  And then call your
druid friend (that sweet girl over there /point) a bitch when she asks them
to leave.

Or the feeling you get telling an ex-guildmember who you argued with you on
guild message boards that while you're deeply sorry he desperately needs a
well equipped level 65 warrior for his special mob, you're currently
otherwise engaged.  That you wouldn't want to be late for meeting with the
psychiatric help that he so thoughtfully suggested you seek.

From the amount of bitching they did, in each case I think I made them cry.
