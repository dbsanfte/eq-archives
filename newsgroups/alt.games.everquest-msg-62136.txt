Another in Verant's long history of really stupid spells for clerics,
I'm nonetheless keen to come up with a use for this spell.

According to eqcastersrealm, it costs 600 mana to cast,
creates a hammer pet with 100hp which hits for a max
of 48.

This pet, it seems to me, would not be all that unbalancing
if it was a normal pet, or even one like a chanter pet.  But
instead its even -more- limited than a chanter animation:
you must have a target selected when you cast, and it
goes straight for that target, attacks till the target dies,
and then commits suicide.  Thats not unbalancing, its useless!

Reckoning does (at my level) 630 points for 250 mana,
so I could cast that twice, 1260 damage, and still have 100
mana left over, for what the UHOF costs.  Pets swing at
3 second intervals, so it will take 80 seconds of doing max
damage before the UHOF finally does as much damage as
those two reckonings did.  In fact, my high end damage
of 90 would mean that in a situation where the pet would
do any damage, I'd be doing more damage by swinging
away myself rather than casting UHOF and then medding.

One glimmer of hope:  one of the notes to UHOF stated
that if the cleric is aggro'd by another mob while the
first is being killed, the hammer won't poof, but instead
will go after the second mob.  Perhaps the UHOF is
a little more useful than it seems on the surface; if it
really dies only if I'm not being attacked, it could be used
to cut massive swathes through deeply green dungeons,
as long as I keep on aggroing creature after creature.

Then another note says that the pet can no longer be buffed
up.  So I can't boost its HP and AC up to where it can
survive greenie after greenie after all, heck, I won't even
be able to use Celestial on it!
