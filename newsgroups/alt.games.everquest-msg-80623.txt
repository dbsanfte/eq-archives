I had/have this problem.

Some of the things to consider.

Do you have a WIN Modem?  These things are small, cheap and have no
processing on them.  They use your CPU to process information.  - The
problem here is that Directx8.1 also uses your CPU for a lot of the Direct
Play information so when you're zoning etc., and you receive a good bit of
data, your CPU can't keep up with it because it's trying to do all the new
graphics etc.,  So guess what?  Hope your modem has a higher priority (which
I doubt) than your Phat-Power Video card...  LD.  Happened to me a lot.  I
moved my PCI cards around in my PC and it has almost gone away.

Another thing that seemed to really REALLY hurt my connection was upgrading
to 512megs of ram then turning off my Texture Cache option in the game. -
You know, the game says it's really of most benefit to those who have less
than 512.. so I turned it off.. Seems this checkbox directly related to my
connection and turning off the check turned off my ability to stay connected
haha.. (when zoning).  So I turned it back on and now I am better. - Not
100% but better.

Strange because I have a clean windows install (brand new install) and I
have totally reinstalled EQ and all expansions.  The problem is, I crash
directly to desktop now.. with no warning and no pattern or reason to it.
Wonderful.

I'm shopping for a hardware modem now... no more "Win/Software" modems for
me.
