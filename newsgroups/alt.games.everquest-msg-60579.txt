As a person who does the tech support for the local cable modem installation
company. I can say without a doubt, USB sucks as a intermediary from PC to
modem. Get a good PCI or ISA card and be sure to check the IRQ's once it is
in, sometimes if the Ethernet card and graphics card share the same IRQ, it
will cause problems if you use them in an extreme manor, such as playing an
MMORPG if they do share an IRQ just move the Ethernet card to a different
slot. But the main point is get it off the USB. Unless your on a static IP
or DNS then you shouldn't have to worry about settings in the network once
installed. just plug it in and reboot both the modem and PC, but check with
your ISP about that.
