There are several ways.

If you want to know about the person you have targeted, type in
/whotarget (which can be shortened to /whot.) To see everyone in the
zone, use /who. You can do a filtered who, as well; /who <x> will show
everyone in the zone who either is a <x>, has <x> in their name or is
in a guild that starts with <x>. My main character, Rosewhite, is a
halfling druid and belongs to the Povar-Tarew Artisans guild. If you
are in the same zone as her, she would show up if you do /who Rose,
/who halfling, /who druid or /who "povar-tarew". Note that you CAN use
double quotes if <x> has special characters or spaces. /who heroes
might show everyone who is in the guilds "Heroes Blood" and "Heroes Who
Die Often", as well as the character named Heroespit. /who "heroes
blood" will only show those in that one guild. You can use the word
'all' to show everyone who meets your filter on the server, so /who all
rosewhite will give you info about me, even if you are in Rivervale and
I'm in West Freeport.

There is one caveat to using /who and /whot. If the character is
anonymous, either by using the /anon or /roleplay commands, you will
get a name (and if they are /roleplay a guild tag, if any) but you will
NOT get a race, class or level. These are often used by people who wnat
to avoid constant begging for sows, ports, clarities and rez's. Not
always, though, so don't assume that all anon players can offer the
services you are looking for :-)

The few times one of my characters asked for a sow, I was always
prepared with at least 5 gold, preferably a plat. If you ask nicely,
with full spellings (ie use please and you, not plz and u) and even in
character ("Wise one, I would make a contribution to the Tribunal if
you could bestow on me the spirit of the wolf.") very often you will
get it for free. Just make sure, though, that you have the donation
available and are willing to pay it; most druids don't get paid very
much from their day jobs.
