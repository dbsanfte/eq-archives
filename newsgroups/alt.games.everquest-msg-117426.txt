Well, to each his own, but in the transparent inventory screen mode, hitting
the alt key will cause the spell names to appear next to the spell icons,
you can then use the trackball, if you really must, or just hit alt-1
through alt-8 for spell slots 1 through 8 to cast the spell.  I have a 19"
monitor, and I run at 1280x1024 all the time, I have no trouble at all
reading the spell names, not to mention, that I always memorize spells in a
particular slot.  I have two basic spell setups, one for soloing, one for
grouping, and I usually only change out two spells between those two.  Slots
1 through 3 never change, slot 5 never changes.  Slot 4 is my buff slot,
slots 6 and 7 change depending on soloing or grouping, and slot 8 changes
situationally.  After 54 levels, can reliably hit alt plus the appropriate
number for the spell I need.
