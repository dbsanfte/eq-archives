The quality of the banded armor never changed, and, I am still very good 
at making banded armor.  Unfortunately, due to changes in the 
marketplace, it is no longer a viable product.  My skill at making it has 
not changed in the slightest, just market conditions.  This would make my 
business of making and selling banded armor a failure, but, does not make 
my making of banded armor a failure.
