That just blew up in everybody's face since to get an "--->" on the map
instead of a "+" showing your location, your sense heading skill has to be
trained.  And even before that, for the compass window to be useful you need
to have a decent sense heading skill.

I haven't found the cutoff yet, but I'm watching.  My froggy twink is up to
155 sense heading and still no arrow so I'm beginning to think it's only at
200 skill.
