Aviak guards are decent in lake rathe, You might be able to solo Jonah, also in
lake rathe, sorry don't remember location off hand.  In Rathe Mountains you
should be able to fight Giant skeletons.  In south karana at 18, probably try to
get into an aviak group at the aviak village.  These aviaks are much higher
level than the ones in lake rathe.
