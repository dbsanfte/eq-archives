UPDATE:
We were grouped with a mage in the Hole last night at the entry. Holy
Dirt of Brell dropped again. The mage did an identify on it. It ID'd as
some other name (I forget now, need to check my log) but he said, "Cool!
That's part of my epic! But I already have one."  

So, if he's right, it's some rock needed for the Mage epic.
