Well, I truly hope the new zones are good, but they have already
announced that they are aimed at the 35-60 level. I may have a look
around them if I change my mind on purchasing, but nothing more unless
there are quests I'm pursuing that require time to be spent there. The
changes already made to the zones disappoint me. Innothule swamp will
always mean Trolls to me. A guildie played his 60 Warrior last night,
and then unloaded all his items and deleted the toon. Said it wasn't the
same anymore. Admittedly, it was a 3rd alt and seldom played, but I know
if Felwithe and GFay received the same treatment, I would feel let down.

New Race. The least interesting part of LoY for me. I really don't care
if my wizard is 2 foot nothing or tinted green, A wizard is a wizard!!
Now, if they had introduced a new class, we might be talking! I think
SoL's Beastlords were one of the best parts of that expansion! I already
have almost all classes that I want to play covered, and as I mentioned
in an earlier thread, if Bards had been an option, then Michigan would
be ready to go, lol! I see no point whatsoever in having more than one
of the same class. too boring and repetitious unless the 2nd was on test
to cover patch days! Gotta feed that addiction!!

New spells might turn out to be useful, but only time will tell. I don't
use all of what is already out there, as I find no need to purchase each
and every spell available.
