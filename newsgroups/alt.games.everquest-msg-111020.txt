Why is it people can't seem to COMMUNICATE before inviting you into a group
or guild?  No matter what character I am using, if I'm not in a group I'll
occasionally see the "so-and-so invites you to join a group".  No hello,
what level are you, are you even looking for a group, are you able to help
me for a bit, etc... I won't group with these people.  People bitch about
being inspected all the time, which doesn't bother me at all (it's when they
laugh afterwards that bothers me though), but I almost think this is a
little more rude.
Now I'm not in a guild.  My little guild got disbanded after the leader
instructed his wife how to disband it.  Evidently his snowmobile kissed a
tree fairly hard and he's laid up in the hospital for a bit, so instead of
keeping the few members hanging he abolished it altogether.
Now I get these little boxes inviting me to guilds all the time.  It's been
only 2 days and I must have declined 2 dozen invites, seriously.  They come
up when I'm sitting, when I'm running by, and in battle 3 times which is
total bullshit.
Why can't people at least say something before clicking "invite" of any
type?  It's so annoying and tacky IMHO.

See y'all around,
SEAN...
