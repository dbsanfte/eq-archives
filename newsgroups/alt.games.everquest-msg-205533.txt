I've been in a number of groups lately, in POP and outside it,
and the general consensus seems to be that POP exp has been
nerfed way back and its now often better to go to the easier "old
world" zones to exp, with more kills per hour, less risk, more
loot, more net exp... why go to POP zones at all?

I can say that even in a full group, I wasn't impressed with exp
per hour in a POD group, the POJ group I was in did pretty well
but it was a very tight ship with everyone pulling their weight
full time, constant pulls and so forth; this group would be good
exp and fun to be in anywhere.  My PON group was crazy hate
kiting fun, and its hard to judge really but I think we'd have
done the same exp in ME or anywhere really, PON just seemed more
challenging cause any slips would have meant hot death on a
stick.

I'm also wondering specifically what this means in terms of a 65
cleric; are there now mobs somewhere I can solo for exp again?  I
ran out of viable solo targets when I hit 62 or so, although I
could solo undead in POV it was quite situational and required
run to zone on a bad pull; which means about 50% of pulls, and on
bad run of luck which meant another 25%... getting one kill per
four tries doesn't add up to a good camp by my lights.  Other
than that, anything I could reasonably solo turned green at 61 or
62.  With the blue range being pushed down, does this mean I can
solo again?
