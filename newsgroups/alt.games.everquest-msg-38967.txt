ok, I've 2 win98 pc's running eq, networked, I have had similar ICS
problems, so I've taken to using Comsocks, (proxy server) which works
reasonably well, although this still seems to hang like ICS, though far less
often.  I have also used WinProxy which again displayed the same problem but
was comparable to Comsocks.

I tried Wingate mentioned in the previous post but shied away from it
because I didn't need the headache of reading manuals, (opening ports etc).
Comsocks just seemed to work on install.

I think that it must be said that a software solution is never going to be
as stable as a hardware one.

That said if i could finally force everthing onto separate IRQ's I suspect
that it would be a better solution.
