Aye - getting a port out would be your best bet. If you are in a guild it
should be no problem, if not, take an Alt to the Bazaar and ask - I'm sure
you'll find a sympathetic ear =).

As an aside - I'd suggest you do the first parts of the Thurgadin Shawl
quest, at least the part where you make a port potion to Thurgadin. This can
be very helpful if you ever find yourself in this situation again, or stuck
on a plane =). You can only have one of these potions with you, but if you
keep the components you need, Velium and Crystaline silk IIRC, in the bank -
you can just make a new one in Thurgadin each time you use it.

You can also buy port potions from Shamans, but they are not cheap. You may
also be able to get an OT port hammer, although getting your OT faction high
enough as a Paladin could be a problem...
