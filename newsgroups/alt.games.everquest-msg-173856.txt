Did you like EQ the first go around? It is a much improved game today.
The lower levels have been made much easier (this can be a plus or a
minus depending on your point of view), and there are MANY more places
to hunt at all levels. The Planes of Power expansion adds an instant
City-to-City teleportation system that eliminates the need to waste
time with boats.

You will be overwhelmed :-) Like I said above if you liked EQ before
the odds are you will love it now.

It really depends on the server you play on. The older servers are
just like you describe. There are a few newer severs with smaller
populations and there is also the Role-Play encouraged server (Fironia
VIe) that only allows 1 character per account. If you are into RPing
it is a great place to be. There are also Player-vs-Player servers
with if that is the style of play you prefer.

>Could anyone else recommend another good MPORPG fantasy?

Well this is an EQ newsgroup.....I doubt you will get much info or
suggestions on competing products :)
