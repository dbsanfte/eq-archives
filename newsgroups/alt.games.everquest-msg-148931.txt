Clerics spamming group heals can help a lot here, just have to
make sure the casters stay clustered near their clerics.  While the
normal plan is to let casters die, just concentrate on keeping tanks
alive, the fact that tanks are getting slowed and that Gore HP
is low enough to allow a nuke based kill (demand a nuke based
kill really, given the CHealing) its actually worthwhile to keep
casters alive instead.  Since their primary source of damage is
the AE, AE heals are a great antidote.

Keep the fight short though, because AE heals eat mana faster
than CHealing ever did.

If she's CHealing, then she's adding to the HP total you have
to get past.  Since you are relying on caster damage, its
entirely possible to run out of mana before you run out of
HP on her, if you let her keep this up.  Its not just a question of
DPS, its one of total damage before OOM.  If you have
overkill available, sure, CHeals are a good way to waste her
time.  But if you are looking into minimum force, its might be
better to see her slaughter a few MAs.

Mod Rods aren't very useful in a 30 second fight.  Assuming you
have one equipped and are ready to chew, you still only get a limited
amount of mana back, and you had to spend the time chewing.
In the AOE environment, its also likely that any active participant
other than the MA is down quite a few HP... taking another 900
damage deliberately might not be the cleverest thing you can think
of to do.
