Unlike kitty beastlords (not that I'm not one of them) there
aren't dozens of these running around on each server, you'll
be somewhat unique.  Cats have decent bard starting stats,
and as a very handy  bonus, are born with a 50 skill
in safe fall.  Since bards get Selo's Accellerando at
level 5, this ability is going to save you a lot of damage
incurred just running from place to place, normal bards
have to wait quite a while before getting this skill.
