A good spot for your level might be the brutes in Warslik's Woods.  They're
in the tunnel system leading to Dalnir's.  It's part of the outdoor zone, so
your outdoor spells will be available to you, and these brutes should have
nice exp for you to boot.  As I recall, they were blue at 30.  I didn't stay
too long because the way they moved the exp bar, I guessed they were barely
blue.  Anyway, they drop gems and stones in the 1 or 2 plat range a nice
portion of the time.  There is a 2 spawn camp in the cavern nearest
Dalnir's, and there is a three spawn camp on a different branch in that
tunnel system.  I had no trouble pulling singles out of these camps with a
wizard.  They are social, but spaced far enough apart it shouldn't matter.
If you hold both camps, you should be able to stay busy.  There is usually
almost nobody in the zone -- a mixed blessing -- and those who are there are
usually doing Dalnir's Crypt, playing a newbie char at the zone line with
Cabalis, or camping the giant fort on the other end of the zone.  So if you
needed to, you could kite one of these things out of the cave and for a
long, long ways along the shore without ever running into a wandering mob or
another player.
