When I tell you it's not a matter of gear, I mean that in all honesty.  Take
my server, for example:  Quellious, with half a dozen high end raiding
guilds.  It's been merged for...  a month?  Two?  A while.  I doubt anyone
from my guild or its allied guild has grouped with anyone from Vis Maior in
that time.  Members of Vis Maior will, on average, be *better* geared than
people from my guild (not by a lot, but equivalency is pretty much
guaranteed).  I repeat, it's not a matter of gear.  =)

Now that's a valid point.  Similar to what I mention below.  Culture shock,
personality clash, whatever, combined, in that particular example with a
worldwide dearth of common sense.  =)

See, that's where it does become a "cultural" difference.  When a group
moves into a certain spot with certain drops, it isn't uncommon for
"gentlemanly NBG" to, without announcement, suddenly come into play. 
Particularly for a group of mostly guildmates.  Again, sending the
non-clique'ed person to the boards to say "And then they just looted a
rune without even rolling!"  You've seen it I'm sure.  =)

It's...  hell, I'll have to look next time I'm in Lavastorm and see what
it's called.  Basically involves a whole lot of running around (either while
sneaking as a rogue, insane as a monk, or while clearing) and then a single
fight (single with said monk/rogue blowing their "escape" button, it's a
one-shot deal so you gotta get it right, which might actually explain the
lack of popularity).

I've wondered why they didn't do something similar to that.  Since they do
end up nerfing values (Creator used to give more crystals for instance), it
seems obvious that they should at least consider a self-adjusting system.

I like all single-group content pretty much.  Once or twice.  Maybe half a
dozen times if it's really cool.  Grinding, though, is when you go on your
10th Creator mission, or spend your 10th hour in WoS.  I don't do that much.

I'm pretty sure I've seen people talking about using DoN augs to fill up
LDoN gear for even better pieces.  I've never bothered to check if that's
possible myself though.

Remember that.  I'm the only person I know with the +4 damage aug for 2h
weapons from an Ikkinz raid, and I got it for a steal.  =)

It's good enough to do DoNs, PG, RS, etc.  Sure, I'll be more concerned
about mana if I'm playing either of my pocket pals than a full-blown cleric
or shaman would, but referring back to the very first paragraph of this
post, I would get the group over better-equipped-person-with-no-guildtag.

But the gap has *narrowed*.  That's really what puzzles me the most.  This
topic has always been around, but has been brought up a lot more recently
and argued much more vociferously (not just here by any means, there's a
many hundreds of posts long thread on the monk class boards as well as
elsewhere).  Why, when the gap between the raiders and the non-raiders is at
its comparative narrowest, has it become such a hot topic?

The gap during the Kunark-era was nigh infinite, as stats prior to that were
mostly...  er, stats.  Not hp/mana.  The non-raider available pieces
generally had little or no hp/mana, while the class BPs and legs were many
orders greater (and the stuff in VP, for the *truly* hardcore, widened the
range of +hp/mana gear to more slots).

Velious, many would argue, narrowed the gap with at least Thurgadin's armor
available to everyone.  And it did set the baseline, but NToV threw the
baseline out the window.  I had more raw AC during the height of Velious-era
raiding, at level 60, than you do now.  Hell, I had more than *I* do now.  I
still have all my highest AC pieces in the bank and can break 2300 AC (at
about half my current hp =P ).

Luclin, again, brought almost-NToV gear to the masses, but Ssra raid gear
was a step up, and VT gear blew it away.  Lots of people doing Anguish are
still wearing a piece of VT gear.

So why now, when the effects, hp, mana, etc., combined with the ability to
augment gear, makes the gap the narrowest it has ever been...  why now?

Being able to get single-group gear that is 2/3 of the top raid gear is the
best the non-raiders have ever had it, yet I've heard more complaining about
it recently than ever before.

Except for the few clickies, and I think the bard gear, I don't think those
were ever popular so perhaps they should be revamped after all.  I think
revamps need to be very carefully thought out.  CT, for instance, was the
*best* low-30s "dungeon" to learn dungeons in.  Destroyed.  Anyone that
missed it will forever miss one of the best learning experiences EQ had to
offer to a young player.

Raiders aren't better players by default.  More organized/focused, able (and
more importantly willing) to follow directions, no doubt, but not better
players.

*I* am a better player.  If I were a single-grouper, I most assuredly would
go to KT and Yxxta because it would be where my upgrade path led me.  When I
set a goal, I accomplish that goal.  Six plus years and I'm still batting a
thousand in that regard.  =)

There is a monk that I raid with that has me beat by more than 1k hp (and in
the past it was upwards of 2k).  I pull.  Wanna know why, or would you care
to guess?  =)

How'd they get people into a raid so that anyone would hear it?  Mob
strategy is really the easiest part of planning raids.  Most events,
particularly after you've seen them done once, aren't hard to explain.

As someone who has, for the first time in 6 years of hardcore raiding,
recently moved to a non-leadership position...   it has its ups and downs. 
It's most definitely not for everyone.

Leaders who are not planners need a "partner" or they are doomed to failure. 
Planners don't have such a requirement for leadership skills, as anyone can
lead "enough", with willing and helpful friends/guildmates/groupmates, to
get things accomplished.  If you're lacking in both skills...  sorry, you're
screwed.  =)

And reiterate that for every shard camp, signet camp, key camp, every other PoP

No...  it's not.  Look at the range item off...  Saryrn I think, the one
with the clicky proc.  That's from the same zone, off an *easier* mob.  Look
at the monk-useable piercer off Inny (that's how I remember it, no clue on
the name).  And you should see some of the range items I pass on...  I'm
regularly passing up some combination of approximately 40 AC, 100+ hp, 50
atk, spellshield, dotshield, stunshield, 15+ to all resists, clicky buffs,
etc.  The shurikens are not the best items.  They're the longest range
thrown items that are in endless supply.  Huge difference there.

Not in the slightest.  Just because I would go flipping bonkers if all that
effort were directed to single-groups doesn't mean I'm not putting in an
equal or greater effort, it just means I direct my effort in the way that I
find the most enjoyable.

Because when was the last time they were hit for 10k+ in a single round? 
Happens to me regularly.  They are fully capable, in single-group acquirable
gear, of handling every single-group encounter in the game.

You've circled back around to "more time and effort" which I don't think you
can, in any way, back up.  Raiders, in my experience, spend a *lot* of time
online, and being goal driven by nature they are generally putting in effort
even when not on a raid.  Not that there aren't non-raiders that do
likewise, and not that there aren't lazy ass and/or lucky raiders, but it's
definitely not the norm as it is with raiders.

The implication was that you couldn't just charge in with a random pickup
group.  Hell, you can't charge in with a random uber-guild group (I know
because monks aren't high on the list of desirables for the PG trials).

Man, you should try being a monk where that "one best-gear set" has
historically been crap and I have to watch every ALL/ALL piece to create my
frankenstein armor set from.  =)

If an enchanter is basically soloing already, why do you need a tank at all? 
Though I'm sure that's not the answer you were looking for (and believe me
when I tell you it has as big an impact on the range-deficient monk class as
any other), it's the way it is and will get you through.

*I* was tanking WoS, in all my nerfed monkly gloriousness, with no slow, at
8k hp, with my dps being the only thing that killed the mobs.  Granted, that
was easy side and hard side didn't become practical until the nerf was
alleviated and my hp climbed, and granted it wasn't exactly efficient since
it was just me and my pocket cleric, but it sufficed for my goal-driven
purpose of collecting runes (with the obvious extension that I was doing
named mobs this way too).

Not a popular zone.  I've never really known why.  It's easier than WoS and
has just as many named.

That's ridiculous.  Then again, see my comment about wiping on a non-named
with a 16k tank.  =P

AAs are definitely important.  I have all defensive AAs and they are always
my first priority to max with any new ones added.  It's understandable why
people place the emphasis where they do, though.  Equipment without AAs and
you can be acceptable.  AAs without equipment are meaningless.

Oh I'm undoubtedly insane.  I scare hardcore raiders with my playstyle
sometimes.  Casuals either spend any time grouped with me looking for an
excuse to leave or needing a cigarette break.   =)

That's what it takes to be a good puller.  If they aren't fighting to be the
lead puller, there would be a problem.  Competition, even among guildmates,
is a Good Thing.

> 	On the other hand I rarely see them at 500dps :P

That's without discs, I can top 1k dps for about a minute's worth of
fighting.  =) They'll get there.  Fully-buffed I don't even crack 2k atk.  I
do have some pretty fine weapons just by default due to the content I'm
playing in.  I'm utterly toasted by rogues with comparable equipment, and
every monk I raid with beats me on dps *when* they are aware they're being
parsed.  I'm the type that doesn't get any better when someone says they're
parsing because I was already going all out.
