Yeah, if by "the new, very latest Detonator drivers" you mean v. 21.83
(newest as far as I know), these work great both under Win98 and WinXP.
I'm using a TNT2 Pro, and am very happy with these drivers, seem to run
better than the old ones I used.

Also using DX8, no problems at all, in fact, DX8 will be required for
Luclin, IIRC.
