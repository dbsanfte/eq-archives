Not sure off hand how easy you will find getting a group at 55.  PoS has 
frogs that don't summon I am told, although the one time I tried, I got 
summoned.  :b 

As I recall, the frogs in PoV are not rootable, and, thus, I did not 
bother to find out if they summon.

Point Blank Area Effect.  An area effect spell that hits all mobs within 
a given distance of the caster.
