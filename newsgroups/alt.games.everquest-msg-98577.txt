And by "port forwarding doesn't work" you mean ??

I can see problems if you have an router with 2 machines connected.. And
many routers have static portmapping, thus routing incoming traffic just to
one computer.

But if you by "behind same router", does not actually mean the same physical
router, just a similar router, then i would compare settings between those
routers. (Firmware as well)

If you have two machines behind the same router what i would try then is :
Write up your friends ip adress
shut down your friends pc
change your ip adress to the same as your friends, and try again.

Just a thought..
