I just dinged 15 in Everfrost.  I hunted in WK for a while, and like you got
tired of Blackburrow in a hurry.

It's not that far from where you're at, and there's enough to hunt there to
keep you busy for a while.  The full-grown Woolys are still very red to me,
but the Snow Orcs Mountaineers and Shaman are really starting to come into
play.  I haven't even made it past the Ice River yet ... everything over
there's red to me.  When I see Megan's Tower, it's time to stop running and
start tracking.

You'll pretty much always be able to find a group if you want ... the locals
are night blind and will love you for your ability to track. <g>  Good
soloing, too ... pulled white mammoth calves all afternoon.

My biggest problem is that since the character's a wood elf, there are
encumberment issues.  That's once of the reasons I started baking ... take
the spit into the field and turn Mammoth Meat into steaks for little cost.
The steaks weigh less, they're a Hearty Meal, and they're +3 STR when eaten.
I can't remember the last time I bought food.  Good thing too ... for some
reason this wood elf couldn't forage food standing in the middle of
McDonald's.
