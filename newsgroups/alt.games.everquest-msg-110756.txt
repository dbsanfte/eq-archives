I couldnt Agree more. I spent some time on Vallon Zek, and recently moved to
FV. What a difference. The people I have net there have all been, without
exception, nice people. Also, with the lack of OOC, and limieted Shout range
when Im out hunting it seems SO Much more peacefull than when I was hunting
on VZ.

Just my 2 cents.
