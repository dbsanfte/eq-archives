I don't know where you read that Dennis but it's wrong, as the max level
is currently 50. People are in the low-mid 40's though. The lack of
itemization of high end dungeons is slowing them down a lot atm, but
that's getting fixed fast. The lack of player crafted armor over L40 is
also slowing them down, and there's no eta on that unfortunately.

Mythic got caught with their pants down by releasing a game that doesn't
have much content past 30 and had fast leveling for experienced groups
of players used to working together and possessing lots of free time.
They seem to be responding by nerfing various things to try to slow down
the experience gain for everyone, and I suspect they've made a concious
decision to let the powerlevelers go if they get bored enough. Mark
Jacobs posted an cost analysis that showed he could do well with 50k
subscribers and they've acheived almost triple that. He may well have
decided it's better from a financial standpoint to lose 10% of his
player base instead of spending the money to bring on board enough
people to expand the content , fix the bugs and balance the classes
quickly enough to keep the fast levelers.

This could work out fine for the slower more casual customers, as long
as Mythic can keep the content ahead of the bell curve of leveling.
Currently RvR is really not worth playing, due to many bugs, from the
quick healing of keep doors to the lack of any meaning to realm points.
A further fundamental problem, IMO, is the lack of player collision
detection. A lot of the benefits of organized play go out the window
then one side's tanks can run through your sides without being blocked
to take out your back line healers and casters. Who needs clever
flanking manoevers when you can just charge right through?
