I'd say it averages once every two weeks, although it seems to have
picked up just before LoY and never really stopped.

And yes, I can't ever remember a patch that was finished on time.  I'm
in PST, so I don't have to convert.  Acording to thier info it should be
up in 5 minutes for me, we'll see.  It used to be followed by an
emergency patch almost every time the next day as well, so you'd be down
for another few hours the next day as well.  At least they've gotten
better about that.

It's most annoying for me as I only get to play weekday mornings
mostly.  

Be happy, do something in real life, get a break from your addiction. 
Here's an mp3 about patch day.

Hope that works.
