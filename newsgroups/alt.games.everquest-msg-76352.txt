Having a 52 druid, 40 wizard, regular access to a 59 cleric and my main, 55
enchanter, I'd have to say that my enchanter gets pestered the most for
buffs and my druid for ports (though it's usually no more than 2 an hour for
ports).  Cleric for rezzes is pretty common (more common than druid port
requests) but if your corpse is conveniently placed I don't mind doing it if
I have the mana to spare.  I don't take donations unless it's some insane
amount that no broke cleric could turn down. <g>   My wizard is bugged the
least, by far.

I laughed at someone in EC the other day...I'm sure they weren't amused.
They were /shouting a request for an xp rez in Oasis.  The joker was level
19...I mean, come ON now...go kill a bat or something. :p

My enchanter doesn't mem up spells for Oasis beggars.  If I happen to have
Clarity memmed (I have C2 now, and that's almost always memmed) and you're
right there...np, I'll cast it on ya.  I don't deliver.  No self-respecting
enchanter delivers clarity for less than 50p.  If it's in a higher level
zone I may go to the trouble of memming up something else, if it's
convenient, for a stranger.
