bah! bluebies!  PvP is the most fun aspect of EQ!  I play on VZ and when
someone is pissing me off, I annihilate them.

There is nothing like raiding EC and Freeport on my low level PK darkie.

I don't know if i would have fun in EQ without PvP.  It actually gives a
sense of danger and difficulty, unlike the bluebie servers.  Goes to show
you...people made characters on SZ and couldnt take it...so they went back
to their bluebie servers.

The real EQ players are on PvP servers

thats my 2cp
