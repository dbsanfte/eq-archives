I have a /shout TRAIN TO ZONE!! hotkey.  (I also have one for /gsay RUN!!,
for when an encounter goes bad.)  Of course, I don't have room for those
in my primary hotkey set, so it takes two keys to shout the warning.  (Or
three, if you count "alt-#" as two keys.)

This also means that the hotkey set that includes the /shout is one that
has an assortment of other handy but specialised hotkeys, such as /bazaar,
and one that targets the Nexus Scion and asks for a shard to travel to
Luclin.  And that means that I sometimes have that hotkey set active when
I'm in the Bazaar.  So more than once I've shouted a Train warning in the
Bazaar.  The first time I did it, I was so embarrassed that *I* ran for
the zone line. :)
