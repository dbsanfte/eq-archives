??? "they'll turn Monty Haul on us" ???

EQ is and always has been Monty Haul.  The single worst part of the game
is the ever increasing river of loot spewing forth with each patch and
expansion.  Didn't _you_ just make a post in another thread remarking
that and 8/24 weapon with a 75dd (SSoY) used to be "uber"?  And have you
noticed that _nobody_ camps this mob anymore? (SSoY procs at L37, and
I doubt there's an active L37 melee in the game without better weapons,
except maybe on FV).  Hell, I can remember the huge stink and cries of
"nerf the necros" that went up when people realized that a 50 necro
could solo the Lord room in LGuk, now no 50+ necro bothers to do it.

They "turned Monty Haul" long long ago, they've just accellerated the
pace a bit recently.
