EQ is the first game to "Require" DX8..1 Somewhere in the graphics
engine is code that only works under DX8.1. All of your other games
are DX7 or DX8.

Yeah, and I bet black helicopters are hovering over your house. The
removal from the Web site was prompted by the last minute change to
DX8,1. Cards that worked in Beta under DX8.0a had problems after the
last minute change, so it makes perfect sense to remove them from the
"supported list" after the launch. 

The current "supported list" is a list of cards and drivers that are
"KNOWN" to work with EQ after the release of Luclin. The move to DX8.1
was done at the last minute, and it obviously took a few days (or
couple of weeks if you count the holidays) for Verant to sort out
which cards on the list still worked and which didn't. The cards
removed from the list are those that do not have a 100% DX8.1
compliant driver.

The problem is that ATI has not prvided a good DX8.1 driver yet.
Verant's fault in the matter lies with the last minute change to
DX8.1, not in ignoring ATI owners.

>Not all of this is driver issues, nor is all of this EQ issues, it's somewhere
>in between.  That's what makes it so frustrating.

The issue is in the drivers, not EQ. If there was a problem with EQ,
none of the cards currently on the market would work.

ATI has a long history of crappy drivers. Hell, I own an original
Radeon and the new Radeon 8500, but I can't deny ATI sucks at getting
drivers right the first time, and available in a timely manner.

One of two things will happen...

1. Verant will code a work-around for cards that do not work properly
under DX8.1

or

2. ATI will release an updated driver set that addresses issues with
DX8.1 compatibility.
