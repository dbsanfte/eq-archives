It really depends how you're going to play the game, and at what
level to answer that question.

For most of the game, trolls or iksars probably win out.  Regen
from 1-60 is pretty hard to beat.  Iksars get extra AC, trolls get slam,
so it's a toss-up as to which is better.

For the 60+ power gamer, ogres rule the roost.  It's hard to
overstate how nice the no frontal stun thing is in the end game.
All of the differences between the other races can be made up with
itemization.  No frontal stun can't be itemized. Incredibly nice for
tanking, pulling, you name it.

In the end, it really doesn't make a huge difference.  Choose
what's fun for you.
