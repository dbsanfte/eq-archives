KEI costs too bleedin' much unless you're a twink.

And it's not necessarily true that a KEIed cleric is superior. Learning
mana conservation is a *vital* skill for a cleric. A cleric who vocally
refused to take KEI would be far more likely to actually know their class.
And I could be sure that group downtime would still have the cleric
in-camp, rather than stuck without a healer while the cleric goes to
the Nexus for C3.

Personally I would have some fairly strong reservations about grouping
with a cleric who *insisted* on KEI. But then I *play* a cleric and
usually don't bother with it myself; all I know is that when looking for
a replacement cleric when leaving a group, I pretty much just look for
class & level.
