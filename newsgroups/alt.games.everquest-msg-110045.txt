Then again, the character could be real, but he's inflating his
"credentials" to try to attract buyers. In short, he's running a scam.

Like I said, the character could well exist. That's ALL I said. The
*CHARACTER*. Nothing about the equipment, guild history, AA skills,
reputation, etc.

Stop putting fucking words in my mouth then trying to slam me for
"falling for it". Are people really that desperate to take jabs?
