I read the patch message tonight and thought to myself "Finally!
I can change that robe of the lost circle into some sort of tunic!"
Well, Malcohm Thimbleton said he was there to turn robes into tunics
but when I gave him mine, he returned it saying he had no use for
it.  And the robe is still the same.   So what robe is he after?  Or
did I do it wrong?

thanks,

Robert
