Had this in Dulak a few days ago - everything stopped spawning, mobs would
warp for about 2 minutes before finally catching up with you, spells would
cast at the client and then 30 seconds later fire off and give the message.

I petitioned (I know, I know), using the 'can't cast spells, affecting
everyone' category, since quite a few people in the zone were suffering and
it was obviously server-side lag.

Petition text was something like, "mobs have stopped spawning, existing
mobs can't move, pets just run in circles, spells aren't casting for about
30 seconds, looks like server-side lag, knowledge base entry said petition
right away, so have done".

Guess what?

Customer Services closed it with one comment - GM's can not assist you in
spawning mobs, if you believe the spawn is broken, please /bug it.  WTF, I
know they're not the best folk, but don't they even read?
