Most of the good points are true.  On DR, there's still a lot of idiots
polluting the zone in ooc, that's about the worst part.

A few of my groups have been pretty flakey (druids who never buff/snare but
rather nuke, tanks who like to stand far apart so the mob pingpongs and
prevents my backstabs, casters who overnuke early and then run at full
health so that we can't taunt it off them.  Most of these things happen, but
you'd think that by the 40s most people would have a better grip on 'what
not to do'.
