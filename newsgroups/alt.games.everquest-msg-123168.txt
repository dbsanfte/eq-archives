I'm sure I'm an IT.  I even have a LAN in my 'house'.  But I try to avoid it
as much as possible.  My LAN consists of my regualr computer and a computer
in my living room that is my 'media center' and plays mp3s on the stereo and
divxes and the like on the TV.  That's my LAN.

A real IT would know that too many computers for too few jobs just makes a
hard to manage mess.  (There are two other non-hooked up computers on the
premises, they really need to be thrown out).
