 I have yet to find a player I was not able to out-taunt with my SK.
Granted, my Sk is only 50 at this point, but SKs have some incredibly
annoying spells that mobs simply hate. Warriors are normally easily
out-taunted. I find monks a little more troublesome. Hell, even playing
my monk I can out taunt some uber equipped 60 warriors in my guild.
Granted, that's aggro and not taunt, but still...
