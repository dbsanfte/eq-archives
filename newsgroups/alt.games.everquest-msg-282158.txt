Nice to hear you're still around. I just finished a degree part
time (4 years instead of 3, PPH at University of London) and continued
playing EQ throughout, excluding the month either side of exams.

I'm not convinced EQ is dying, but its hard to argue that its not
dwindling. My own guild is a raiding guild, but a relaxed one; no
mandatory raids, only just in Tacvi and 1 trial from Anguish, 3-4
days a week raid schedule, etc. But...  the raids are full every
time, pretty much. 54 people.

I put this down to a couple of things, and one of them is the guild
not being *Driven* in the way the really high end ones are. People
don't burn out, they just take breaks, and theres no reprimand for
leaving a raid cause you dont feel like it, or want to help a friend
with their epic. It keeps EQ fun, and that keeps people logging in.

I've done the high end cutting edge raidy thing. Its fun, its
exciting, but at the end of the day, the commitment demanded, the
soldier mentality, its just not sustainable for people who aren't
making EQ their lives. And with a dwindling player base theres fewer
of those around.

No need to quit to do a degree. Just get a more sensible raiding
schedule, even if you're not as leet because of it ;)
