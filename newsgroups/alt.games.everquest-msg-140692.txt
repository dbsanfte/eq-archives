Oh their DVD player has had few problems.  But from what I've read on 
the DVD newsgroups, every player has problems with a disk from time to 
time, and there's not much you can do about it.  :/  A'course on another 
note, I've never seen any signs warning that certain players have 
problems with certain DVDs, ever!  You must have some nice stores around 
your area.  Lucky.
