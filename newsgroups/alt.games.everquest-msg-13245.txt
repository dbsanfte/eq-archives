High Hold Keep has all sorts of nifty goblins invading the basement. Go
to the bank, then but your back to the teller window and go straight.
Follow the wall to the left, and around and down. There's the guard
room, with its lovely cubbyhole for moderately safe medding, the lookout
room with the two lower level spawns on an 18 minute timer, the warrior
room, and the raider room. Trains do happen, but not terribly often. And
it rates as outside, so you can't shrink the trolls and ogres- but you
can SoW the puller. Running for it is nice- but once you have run, run
all the way back to the zone, and stay upstairs til all mobs are dead-
otherwise the guards follow you and the mobs back into the guard room,
and get in the way.

Happy hunting,
