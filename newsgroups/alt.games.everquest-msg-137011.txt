a few years back in Arlington, TX there was a fairly new mall built by
the highway. There was a stand of trees nearby and they built a pond
near it with some water jets creating a spray effect and the
construction contractor put up some big slabs of rock leaning together
in the middle of the pond on an island sort of reminicient of
Stonehenge. It looked cool at night when they shined lights on it.
Well, the bible thumpers saw something that didnt "glorify jesus in
its every shape, form or movement" and saw it as an evil pagan
influence. After all, if it looks sort of like stonehenge then it MUST
be "pagan" and if its pagan then it MUST be satanic and if its satanic
then it MUST be evil. Well, now that they have determined that it IS
evil then they went on their holy crusade to have the city tear down
that sculpture as a "bad influence on the children because it leads
them to the devil." yeah.....always say its "for the children". They
petitioned the city on the grounds that the city isnt supposed to have
landmarks of a RELIGIOUS nature anywhere and due to the fact that it
looked sort of like stonehenge it might attract druids (no halflings
please) wiccans and various other sundry devil worshippers. They even
claimed to have found candles and a sacrificed chicken thus proving
that non-christian pagans were bloodthirsty devil buggers.

FYI....this is a true story. I lived in Arlington at the time.

just thought i'd keep the thread going and the flames fanned.

p.s. the city tore down the structure.
