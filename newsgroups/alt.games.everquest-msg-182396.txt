Acquiring words and even already researched spells is signifigantly
easier now days with the Bazaar. There are very few words and/or
research spells that can't be bought there anymore. Naturally, it's so
much easier and profitable now to stack them on a trader and leave
them sitting in the bazaar than /auctioning or dumping them on a
merchant.
