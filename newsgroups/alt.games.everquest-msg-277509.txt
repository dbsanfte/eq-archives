Just counted the German language WoW Servers - 40.
That makes roughly 400,000 sold WoW copies in German speaking Europe.
WoW is the number one selling game atm in Germany,and I am not talking
about *online* games,where as EQ2 never occured in any selling charts.
Who is thriving?

I guess SOE shareholders are happy with 600,000 sold EQ2 copies
worldwide,when at the same time a competitor sold 10 times the copies.

I see a very bright future for the SOE managemant.  :-)

Man,sometimes these letters from SOE reminds me of the propaganda
from the old communistic eastern europe,eyes totally closed from
reality.
