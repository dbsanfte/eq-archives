No, they're not sponges. Warriors, Paladins and Shadowknights are. Aside 
from that, I have never considered shaman better than rangers or monks in 
that area under normal circumstances. I've not played a shaman past early 
teens yet, so this *could* just be a misconception on my part, but from 
my experiences grouping with them, I don't remember them being so great 
at taking a beating.

My thought was that neither could *you* had you not been heavily twinked. 
I guessed that they *would* do a better job of it if you took your 
twinkage out of the equation.

My opinion is that the only time a ranger or monk should be trying to get 
and hold aggro is if the other group members are all casters and priests 
- the possible exception being a cleric, but that can be a little risky.

Like I said, I could be wrong, but my thought was that if *none* of you 
had been heavily twinked, then one of them would have been the better 
tank. The fact that you were twinked changed that and made a priest class 
the better tank in that situation. I guess I just never considered a 
priest class to be a better tank than a melee class.
