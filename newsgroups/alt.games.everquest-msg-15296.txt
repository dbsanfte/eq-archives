Rangers don't suck!, you just can't have found out either, (a) How to fight
properly with him/her, or (b) The area you are in isn't the best suited
place for your ranger.  I play a Ranger, the same char I started out with on
EQ, I have been playing since Mar 13th this year and am now lvl 38.  I have
enjoyed every minute of playing a Ranger as my character, and to date, never
had any problems levelling with him.  I spend about 70% of my playing time
solo too, with no probs at all. This is not a *twinked* character either as
I am new to EQ and like I said, its my first.  In this time I have also
raised a lvl9 warrior, a lvl 6 wizzy, and lvl 4 ench and a lvl 8 necro
(which is the most fun!)   I don't play for hours and hours either, maybe 3
hours a night on average during the week, and a few hours a day at the
weekend.
Basically, give Rangers a chance!! and please don't say they suck, it'
fairly offensive!

PS  Not trying to start a fight, just a wee bit of defence for all rangers
out there!  : )
