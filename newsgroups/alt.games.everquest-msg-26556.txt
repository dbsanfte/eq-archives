It would be nice if Verant would ban someone after enough people petitioned
about an iritating begger.  A few warnings and proof to a guide/GM should be
there but ulimately being banned would definitely make for a more enjoyable
game.  On a side note... as often as possible, invite the beggers to collect
their reward in an arena or port them to a very hostile land and leave their
corpse there.
