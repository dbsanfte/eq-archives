for the in combat macro, do this:

/attack off
/doabil 1 (pickpocket)
/attack on
/doabil 7 (disarm)
/doabil 8 (backstab)

No need for pauses (it's /pause 5 btw anyway), you'll be mashing both
buttons enough that you won't have to worry about reuse times.

make a separate evade button, this one can have your superfluous skills in
it:

/attack off
/doabil 2 (hide)
/attack on
/doabil 3 (Sense traps)
/doabil 4 (disarm traps)

You're trying to make things too complicated, and it wouldn't work at all if
you had any sort of haste on you, as backstab would speed up.

The 2 buttons above are tried and true and have worked for me for years.
