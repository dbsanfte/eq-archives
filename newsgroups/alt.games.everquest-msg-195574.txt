I admit that being the claim of "OOM 75% of the time" is an gross
exaggeration.  I just love that C3.  =)

But losing that 14 per tick does hurt & yea, I get low on mana.  Usually my
wife (beastlord) & I group together, & I dual box a cleric to heal the pets
& when we have no C3 things go ALOT slower.

When we join up with friends, & we start doing the major pull/kill as fast
as you can for insane XP, yep, I got to pace myself big time when for
whatever reason I don't have C3.   Sit on the horse, send in the pet, nuke
maybe once.    & yep I miss C3 ALOT with I don't have it.
