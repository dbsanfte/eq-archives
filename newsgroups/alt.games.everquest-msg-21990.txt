Maybe it's just karma;  maybe the ball just swung my way...
On the third night of my hunt, I logged in to find a level 60 Monk checking
out the hallway.  She explains that she is looking things over, trying to
figure out the spawn so she can hunt the jester with another character on
another server.  We exchange information, and she camps about 10 minutes
after that. About 10 minutes after she leaves, a bright glow preceeds a
Skeleton walking up the hallway to me - and he's weilding a club.  So I got
an IBC for my cleric in only three nights.
The ball swung the other way for my hunter shortly after;  died twice far
away from my bind point with no one around willing to 'port or ress.  Spent
the weekend doing more walking, swimming, and boating than swimming, and
have less XP now than when I began the hunt for the IBC.

Regards,
Player of:     Valkir Sunderblood - 32nd Warrior
                    Kinweachter Lebenwarder - 30th Cleric
