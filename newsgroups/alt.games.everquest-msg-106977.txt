I have been having the problem since Luclin also. Never prior to that. For
me, it invariably happens while zoning (zoning actually completes in game
but system hangs about 3 secs after LOADING message), it only happens on FV
server (hence, only one character) and it most often occurs zoning into LoIO
from FV. However, it does occur (rarely) at other (than
zoning/porting/gating) times and it does occur when porting/zoning/gating
from/to other than FV and LoIO and it doesn't always occur when zoning from
FV to LoIO. (e.g. I have never had a problem porting myself to WC from LoIO
but, recently, I ported my first group to there and the system hung; e.g. I
zoned from FM to LoIO ok, almost immediately zoned back ok, almost
immediately zoned again and it failed). I have a cable modem (it has heavy
traffic when the system hangs but I assume there would be a lot when zoning)
and the data rate setting that you talk about was originally set to 5. I
have changed it (I use EQu which can be downloaded from
http://www.speakeasy.org/~ruess/) to every other number and it makes no
difference. I understand that my system is not up to spec, in theory, for
Luclin (P3 733, 128mb and a Voodoo 3 2000) but I have other characters on
other servers that I have tested extensively and this problem does not occur
for them. I have a feeling that it may be related to the sound card (SB
Live!) because, when I have sound switched on, I get the same symptoms (i.e
problem occurs during zoning) but the system doesn't hang, EQ abends (ddhelp
caused an invalid page fault in dsound.dll). However, I have all the latest
drivers installed and, anyway, why only one character, one server and with
the sound switched off? I'm, unfortunately, learning to live with it but I
will upgrade memory/video card soon in the hope that that will resolve the
problem. I don't hold out much hope, though,because most other people that
have reported similar problems usually have the recommended memory/video
card installed anyway.
