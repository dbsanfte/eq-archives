the Axe is "ok" for about 50p` servers vary. You really should go with 2 1
handed weapons imho.
Ranged go for a bow to pull with or an AC item like a fetish or idol.
BoE last i saw is lore so look for another bracer with higher AC also.
Black alloy is ok starter armor. It's chain and black, might look kinda
strange with the chitin chest that is silver chain and the crafted plate
shoulders being kinda light blue.
The chitin armor is a rare drop from a rare spawn so it might be hard to
come by anyway.
A fine plate visor is made by smiths so you will likely need to find a smith
and order one.
Try to get the best ac for the plat that you can then consider hitpoints
then strength.
