Here's some ideas to make grouping easier:

1) make sharing quests easy.

2) Give people room to describe what sort of group they are lfg.. e.g. I'd like to do quests. As it stands, people in 
eq2, for example, just tend to grind xp in groups and do quests solo. It's a lot more fun bashing 40 bears or whatever 
in a full group, but getting a group in the dungeons can be quite painful. I hate asking people who are lfg if they want 
to help do some quest, they almost never see the point of straying outside the few zones people use for grinding.

3) see 1. I think this would make a huge difference.
