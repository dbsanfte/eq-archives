There is more to oudoor areas than just spellcasting restrictions. 
There's making full use of your speed-increasing spells, being able to 
leg it when things go south, quadding (for those who are into it - I'm 
not one of them), and generally a wholly different approach to engaging 
mobs than the typical dungeon crawl. Until LDON, EQ had a balanced 
approach; I'm not thrilled by the idea of yet another expansion full of 
dungeons only.
