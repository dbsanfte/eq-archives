Shadow Wolf paws are a rather rare drop that I have seen in East
Commons and Nektulos.  It only drops off Shadow Wolves.  

Unfortunately, these zones are rather difficult for a Newby Paladin to
be in just now.  You will probably get eaten by the higher level trols
and DE's that are supposed to be marching through the Commonlands.
