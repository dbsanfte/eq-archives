And you base this on what evidence?

"Human nature" is not a fixed set of identical behaviors and
attitudes.  I will never stop being amazed at the attitude
I noted above because it is foreign to me, I do not empathize
with it.  It is as foreign now as it was the first time I
understood it as motivating somebody else's behavior.  Yes,
is common.  No, it is not universal.  Yes, I am amazed anew
each time I notice it.

OTOH, your attempt to disparage my experience, indeed to insist
that it does not exist, out of an apparent failure to recognize
that not all minds work as yours does, is not at all foreign to
me.  I recognize and empathize with both the behavior and the
(presumed) motivation [qth].
