I have just started playing a monk (currently level 5) and plan to
modestly twink him.  My main questions are:

Do I make my first major purchase weapons (fighting batons for
example), or armor (WU's ) or jewelery to enhance stats.  I figure
that if I get the weapons, I will go the cured silk route till I can
afford better.  I figure a complete set of WU's armor will set me back
enough that I really want have the cash for a real decent weapon.  I
currently am wielding two splintering clubs and they are much too
heavy if I plan to advance much further.  I put all my bonus points in
the character creation in stamina.  I figure that strength and agility
gear will be easier to come by.

I appreciate any thought you might have.

Thanks
