Hey all got a quick question for you guys. I just bought 512mb Ram since my
buddy told me it would improve the how eq runs since I seem to have bad
video lag. well after installing the Ram it seems eq won't run for me I
either get a eqmain.dll error or just get disconnected after i choose a
server. I went to the eq site and tried the whole delete eqclient.ini. ,
dx8,  eqgame, eqmain.dll   and that still did'nt seem to do the trick. Also
if I remove one of the 256mb chips and just run the game with 256 it seems
to run just fine and would still be an upgrade from my 128 hehe but was
looking forward to zipping around the game alot better lol.  currently use
windows 2000 and a geforce card and never had issues til now.  If any of you
all have any advice or had this similiar problem and know a fix any info
would be greatly appreciated
   Thank you for your time  :)
