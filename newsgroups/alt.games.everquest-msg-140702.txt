Well... once upon a time the Miller thing mighta been true (although pretty
damn gimpy). With the advent of Kunark and Luclin there should be ample
places to level.

Putting aside quadding (which also IMHO is gimpy), you could probably do
well in LOIO in Kumark or *possibly* Marus Seru/Paludal Caverns/Netherbian
on Luclin (not sure of your actual level).

Perhaps Great Divide/Eastern Wasts once you get into the 30s.
