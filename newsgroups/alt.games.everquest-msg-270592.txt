That's not a good idea.  When the period is up and things slow down 
again, that will make the game seem slow by comparison.

In general, temporary changes to the game rules are a bad way to 
apologize to or compensate the players.

Also, what about those people who are unable to play during that 24 
hours?  They will feel left out, like they are not getting their 
compensation/apology for the downtime.  Better would be to flag each 
character as getting N hours /played of boosted XP, so that people will 
get it regardless of their play schedules. 

The three free days are much better.

A couple years ago in DAoC, they had a vaguely similar situation, in 
that they had to do a small rollback.  They too chose to 
compensate/apologize by giving XP, but did it with a lump sum.  That is, 
when you logged in, you found that you simply had extra XP (about half a 
level for me low 20's healer).
