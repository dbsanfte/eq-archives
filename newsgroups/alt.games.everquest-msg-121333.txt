    The whole way death is handled in EQ is hard to justify in roleplaying terms.  In
real life, if Lenny were slain by a Sarnak, I would be devastated, and cry for
weeks.  It would take me a long, long time to put my life back together again.  In
EQ, when he gets hit by a bus or whatever, I just wait for him to come back (or,
these days, simply cast a rez on him).  For what it's worth, we never intended for
him to die on any of these encounters, we really hoped we could take it down.  But if
he fell, and the wisp was so wounded that my meager cleric melee skills were enough
to make it turn tail (or whatever) and  run, I don't see anything cheesy about
turning autoattack off, following it around, and waiting for Lenny to rejoin me so
that he can get the exp as well.

   Heh.  Can you imagine what the /guild chatter looked like during these epic
battles?  Or the after slaughter finger-pointing session(s)?  It seems they might
have avoided this by simply keeping the key commands in /guild anyways.  But then
that wouldn't have looked as "cool" to the whole zone, I suppose.

Annie <--- Going to pay close attention now should the /shout Clerics Camp come up
during guild events.
