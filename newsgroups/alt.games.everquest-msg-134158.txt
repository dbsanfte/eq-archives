I have never parsed a log in my life.  As such, I'm looking at
damage from the standpoint of leaving on my hits and group hits
over a period of time, and then adding up damage.  Up till 44, this
rough guestimate approach showed me getting close to warrior
output, well behind rogue and ranger output, but actually better
than paladin output, from a random sampling of the various melee
I grouped with.  I'm joking around with the 45, 46, 47 progression,
what I'm meaning to say is that I'm better than I was before... but
paladin damage output climbs away quite steeply above the 44
level, so what seems like an incredible climb in output from me
really only amounts to an incremental increase in comparison.

SOS is free click cast off chanter epic.  I very rarely get any
other form of haste.  Until this patch, bard haste (the other sort
I easily get, since its group) was actually a slow... bard in
group meant hanging up my melee aspirations entirely unless
a chanter was also SOSing me.  Course SOS plus 60 bard would
make me capable of outdamaging a 48 paladin (probably not)

I see it used a lot in exp groups.  Or maybe I don't.  I see it used on
me a lot, because I specifically ask "do you have epic?" and on
confirmation, ask to be kept in SOS.  After the laughter dies down,
most chanters are happy to comply, probably on a "keep the
cleric happy he'll probably do a better job of keeping me alive"
basis rather than actual belief in my damage output.

Why is that?  Rangers and rogues tend to have lower AC and lower
HP unless specifically kitted out for tanking... and it seems to me
silly for them to outfit themselves this way since its a job they are
never going to be able to do particularly well.

Ranger a bit lower than me.  And definately -not- tank material, his
gear is very heavily biased towards Dex, damage, and procs.  Clerics
have ample reason to lean to heavy AC and heavy HP, and even if
ranger has equal gear, clerics have the BAOR line of buffs which are
self only, so they can buff themselves up higher than they can buff
the ranger.

I say "tank" here, but what I really really mean is Sponge.  In no way
is a cleric going to do even a fraction of the melee output of a ranger
or rogue...when I compare myself to a paladin, its because that was
in my experiences up to the mid 40s, the lowest damage output melee
class.

With the cleric/ranger(or rogue) duo plan I'm talking about, I could
soak up a couple Khp of damage (which took significantly longer
to happen than it would on the ranger) and then very easily duck
aggro to the ranger, who would sponge for the time it took to cast
two heals, one for me, one for him.  A little struggle to get aggro
back and hold it, but we basically multiplied the available HP
to do the job with by three over having the ranger do all the tanking
himself.

It was beyond a doubt one of my wackier plans, but I assure you that
it actually was more sensible than it appeared on the surface, worked
quite well, and gave me many many defense increases, in fact by far
the majority of defense raises I have gotten post 50 have been from my
few excursions into tanking.

Key here was that it is -extremely- easy for a ranger to get aggro on
demand.  Stop chain jolting, cleric stops tossing stun flash root stun
flash root and turns off attack, and its no more than a blow or two
before the mob drops all thought of the cleric. Course the cleric is
also backing off a bit on the chance that the mob actually is rooted,
and prox aggro takes over... prox aggro was also part of the reason
the cleric was holding aggro over the ranger in the first place.

Its actually a bit more difficult to hold aggro off the rogue, but the
trick there is for him to BS and -then- evade, rather than the classic
evade then BS.  Again cleric works the cheap cast annoyances as
fast as he can, and also relies on root/prox aggro.  If you don't want
to be MT with a rogue, you still wade in and melee, so that every
BS cycle he can dump to you, then regain aggro almost immediately
via BS.

I soloed literally half of each level from 44 to 54, and have soloed on
and off for significant portions of quite a few other levels.  If you
don't have time to commit to forming a group, going somewhere for
a while, and working long enough that it doesn't feel worthless, cleric
solo isn't all that terrible.  On top of that, if you are doing household
chores, cleric solo can be ideal; you kill a mob or two, then go
somewhere safe to med for five minutes while you do something
IRL, return to play for a minute, go away another five... this isn't
something that works well in group play.

The high degree of resists, the relatively minimal effect
versus the massive damage output you are facing, the
fact that any added hate may mean aggro to you which
can mean raid wipe... when the mobs get very very serious,
I don't MoK them unless killing their DS is of supreme
importance.

On the other hand, in most exp groups, I MoK every mob
who is likely to live more than a minute or so.
