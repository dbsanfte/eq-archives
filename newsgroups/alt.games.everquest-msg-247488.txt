I have been let's do a little test:

1.	Migrate the game to DX9 when a lot of the player base have graphics
cards that cannot cope ... good decision that one.

2.	Release an expansion, GoD ... which is really only useful to less
than 5% of the player base (and even they complain about hard content)
... good decison that one.

3.	Fail to correct continuing in game errors such as graphics glitches
in PoK and Bazaar ... oh yes that is a good decision too.

4.	Market the release of a new expansion, OoW, which most customers
appear not to want, because they haven't even seen all of the content
of the current expansions ... another good one.

I think there are probably more but those are the very bad business
decisions take lately by SOE ... do I have hope they will correct them
maybe .. but I think the horse has bolted for a lot of people.
