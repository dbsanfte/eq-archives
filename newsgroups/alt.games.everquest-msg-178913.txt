All shaman and all necros can bandage mana.  Convert health to mana, bind
wounds.

There are crack potions too, they are just ridiculously expensive to make
for a net effect of a Breeze, or Breeze+1.  There are also "Gift of Magic"
type potions, and "Intellectual Advancement".

Mystical Infusion
Ingredients: 2 Sickle Leaf (not stacked)
Trivial: >200
Effect: +50 to mana pool
Duration: ~20 min

Greater Mystical Infusion
Ingredients: Yerbhimba, Sickle Leaf
Trivial: >200
Effect: +100 to mana pool
Duration: ~20 min

Elixir of Concentration
Ingredients: Yerbhimba, Violet Tri-tube
Trivial: >200
Effect: Regen 2 mana per tick
Duration: ~20 min

Greater Elixir of Concentration
Ingredients: Duskglow Vine, Violet Tri-tube
Trivial: >200
Effect: Regen 3 mana per tick
Duration: ~20 min

Mystical Aptitude
Ingredients: Duskglow Vine, Yerhimba
Trivial: >200
Effect: Intellectual Advancement(raises effective casting level +3, reducing
fizzles)
Duration: ~20 min

For comparison purposes:
Breeze is 2 mana per tick
Clarity is 4 mana per tick

So, a level 65 shaman with maxxed alchemy (205) has a good chance at failing
to make a potion that can give the user Breeze, or Breeze+1, for a cost to
the shaman of 71.4pp for Breeze, or 87.15pp for Breeze+1.  Yes, I can see
the casters of Norrath clamoring for a 20 minute duration Breeze+1 that
costs them a mere 100 to 150pp or more per dose.

Or, you can go all out and get Intellectual Advancement for 20 minutes for a
mere 150 to 200pp.  That is per single dose.

In addition to those, there are cannibalize potions that require dropped
components.

Hmm, sorry, got off subject here a bit, I'm not bitter about alchemy, no,
not at all.
