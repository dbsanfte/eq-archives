These ones are at least recognized by Agent to be quote markers (the
ones below aren't by default). But they all have the same flaw - with
non fixed size fonts they are very narrow and therefore very hard on
the eyes. The last one, the one Annie likes, is the worst of all.

But if those are what you are going to choose from, might as well keep
what you are using now. They're all as narrow or even narrower than }.
