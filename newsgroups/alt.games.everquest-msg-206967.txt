Our resident uberguild on Drinal (the server I share with Monual, not that 
I ever expect to be hunting in the same zone or even tier as he) are a 
well-renowned group of pricks. I have personally witnessed them KSing VSR, 
and there are many reports of the same on many epic mobs. Additionally, 
they have been brought to task by GMs many times for ninjalooting, 
intentionally feign-training people, and lots of other despicable 
behaviour.

A loot whore is not only tolerated there, but is in fact at home with her 
peers.
