The point of a massively multiplayer game is for the massive number of 
players to be able to interact. If plat is no drop you eliminate its value.

Players will simply switch to a different standard currency... bone 
chips, spider silks for the small denominations, gems and what not for 
the higher denominations...anything that is stackable and tradeable 
would become the new currency... except at the top end game where it 
will be the barter system. (Just as it used to be way back when there 
were less plat-sinks... and wealthy players no longer had any use for 
additional plat, and thus were only interested in trades...

Make everything no drop would solve this, but really ... whats the point?
