I figured out what's "wrong" with DAOC: There's nothing to look forward to.

Druids: Look forward to levitate, then sow, then self port, then wolf form,
then group port, then being planar, then becoming a wanderer, a preserver
and a heirophant.

Every class is like that.

In DAOC you have a number of lines of spells, at least one of which will
likely be totally ignored so that you can get higher level spells in the
other lines. And when you level you may get an upgrade to that spell. That's
all.

At level 15 (well, apparently any time, but 15 is the reasonable lowest
limit) you can defend your realm against player invaders. At level 25 you
have a reasonable chance of doing it and staying alive if you're not stupid.

If you aren't into PvP you can still get to 50...collecting your various
spell upgrades as you go along, killing higher level critters than
before...losing more xp per death than you would in EQ without a rez (or so
I've heard...it certainly sucks at 16 to die WITH a rez).

There's nothing for PvE people to look forward to. They say you'll be able
to buy houses & maybe horses with Realm Points, but you can't get Realm
Points unless you do PvP. If they ever get those items in the game you can
bet that you have to do a LOT of PvP to buy anything cool.

I hope to god I'm wrong and would love for folks to correct me.
