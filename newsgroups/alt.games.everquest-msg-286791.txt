Summary:
Keywords:
 
 
Last night (21/Feb/97), I was listening to BBC GLR. You have to understand that
I was listening by stealth. Back in 1990 I used to have Capital blaring out of
the speakers all over the garden ("if he listens to Capital then he can't be
all bad", thanks ever so much). But now I listen on my walkman on headphones
with the volume turned right down. It could not possibly be overheard by any
listening device, no matter how sensitive, because sound does not carry from
the headphones.
 
Yet somehow they are still able to tell which station I am listening to on the
walkman. And last night, I bravely tuned to GLR 94.9FM at around 8.45pm.
Everything went well for the first half hour or so. The DJ (today GLR told me
it was David Hepworth) had a "rock star spelling competition" (how do you spell
Shakespear's Sister?), no trouble there. I was recording the show onto tape
just in case anything unpleasant happened, as I had reason to think it might.

Around 9.10pm, it did. Here, precisely, is what Hepworth said after the song
"Come Around" by the Muttonbirds (I have this on tape, and at some point will
be posting the audio on my website);
 
"New album's called 'Envy of Angels', that comes out soon, that's the single
that's already out, I would imagine, that's 'Come Around', the Muttonbirds, er,
coming up after this, we got the rock-and-roll A-level, we have, I assume,
Brian do we have an embarrassment of prizes in there, we do, don't we,
(EMPHASIS) absolute obscene (END-EMPHASIS) amounts of prizes, there will no
doubt be a riot at the back door", and that's, er, A-level coming up after this"
 
The key phrases in what he said are, "EMBARRASSMENT of prizes", and what he
himself emphasized verbally, "ABSOLUTE OBSCENE amount of prizes". It is my
belief (based on content and tone of voice) that when he spoke these phrases he
knew I was listening, and that the phrases refer directly to my situation. The
"EMBARRASSMENT" is the embarrassment he and other media people would feel at
having their wrongdoing exposed; the "ABSOLUTE OBSCENE" (which he verbally
emphasized) described the disgusting sexual abuse which the harassers have been
throwing at me.
 
Needless to say, I can't prove this is what he meant, although this has
happened enough times that it's hard not to recognise it when you see it. But I
shall be sending him a copy of this explanation. We'll see what he has to say
for himself.

I will try to explain with greater clarity.
 
I am prone to have ideas of "interactive watching" by people on TV, and
"interactive listening" by people on the radio; which means as I listen to
their programme, they are aware that I am listening (because my home is spied
on, and those doing the spying phone up the radio station and tell them that I
am listening to them), and they then interject nasty remarks in what they say.
This is what I believe may have happened on Friday night with GLR, and what I
was trying to explain in my article.
 
It's happened before with other radio stations, most worryingly when I am
listening quietly on my walkman as happened on Friday. This time, the
interjected words were "embarrassment" and "absolute obscene". The "absolute
obscene" referred to the abuse which is currently being directed at me.
 
I hope that's a little clearer.

Just because you need to read it twice in order to understand it, is
that any reason to inflict it on the rest of us again ?

Mike, try playing a cassette in your walkman. There is no way they can
reach you then. HTH

But it is possible that those two sets of interjected words could have
validly referred to something else.

Thank you, it is a bit clearer.

Though I have to say I've never heard one as obscure as that, even
from Mike. How he can believe a rubbish trail for a crap competition
is directed at him is beyond me!
He's sent a copy of the post to the jock, too. I hope he doesn't read
it out.
