Very likely, my raiding career ended not long after it started (won't get
into the where's and why for's but suffice to say I don't expect to be
starting something big at 4am when it was meant to start at 12am) so this is
way before SoL and as such would be considered low end content.
Obviously not going to argue the warrior point with you but I seem to
remember reading in this group once that if the SA went down, even with a TA
assigned the raid was normally shot, of course things change and as content
gets tougher so tactics get better.
Enchanters I am surprised about, mainly due to the amount of invites my
Enchanter used to get (/role removed this, now she just gets asked for
Res's.../shrug) Maybe that's a lack of Enchanters, again, at 52nd, these are
raids that are bottom end of the scale.

Even so, for the OP would be better to pick either Enchanter or Cleric,
IMUO, just because Warriors are 2 a penny, it would seem (Go on, tell me I
am wrong and 55+ Warriors are rare as rocking horse shit on your server :ï¿½))
