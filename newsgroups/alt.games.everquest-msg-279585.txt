	Well, I think if you weren't a raider the strapon would be on the other 
crotch and you'd think it was a big, big problem. I think you're 
completely out of touch with the true single-group game.

	If the group had a slower & healer already, and had a free slot open, I 
would always accept the first DPS that was available. If that happened 
to be a monk, cool.

	Wouldn't that make this an interesting argument. I'd wager my goranga 
idol that if DoN had better gear in it than Anguish, Sony would have 
spent more time on those missions - and probably would do something 
about Creators being so freaking dominant.

	Which is interesting, because I'm pretty sure the bulk of their 65+ 
players do DoN missions but wont see Anguish for at least another two years.

	I'd call it three weekends, personally. I would like you to grind 6

	I'm not sure we're on the same page here. Raiders and Single-groupers 
have the same number of slots. Raiders fill theirs with uber raid gear, 
and fill in the gaps and empty aug slots with single-group gear. Whereas 
single-groups just get single group junk and aug it with single-group 
junk augs. If the gear levels were better balanced, they should be able 
to group together and not suffer overmuch for the single-group stuff. 
The raiders don't get extra slots to cram group-gear into next to their 
raid gear.

	How many DoN augs are you wearing today?

	No it isn't. It isn't as good. It isn't good enough to be equiavalent 
for most purposes, it isn't anywhere near as good. Period.

	Velious was released five years ago man. You can't expect its raid

	I think obsoleting anything is a bad thing. Look at the perfectly good 
Sol Ro armour quests. Single groupable all the way, lots of resources 
went into making them cool and fun, the rewards are utterly bloody 
useless now.

	I'm serious, I think its a shame those quests (and others) aren't revamped.

	Just as there is a huge gap between the theoretically possible and what 
large groups of people will actually put themselves through, especially 
for third-rate rewards.

	What percentage of raiders plan stuff? I'm gonna estimate 15%.

	I plan stuff, but I can only control one guy. I spent several hours 
last night reading up on future possible upgrades and where I should be 
taking my gear next, but I can't sit down and plan out my assault on the 
MPG single-group trials, because nobody in my guild takes instructions 
from me.

	If I really wanted to, I could probably organise something with this 
guild to attack those trials. However, I don't need to as we've just put 
Time on farm status. If I was in my previous guild, we would probably be 
doing MPG trials by now.

	I'm sure I'd be great at it. I've got a time collar, it's not as

	I would love to test that theory someday, I have a feeling you might 
find the results surprising.

	Of course I'll unhesitatingly agree it certainly _should_ be true.

	Yes, I must admit I was somewhat tongue in cheek there, and that I 
already know you would get no positive response whatsoever. Some people

	That four hundred creators is a mite too boring a tradeoff for gear 
that isn't quite EP? I don't think that mindset is ridiculous at all.

	The pouch is freaking uber. The Blue Flame Necklace... isn't. It's the 
kind of thing you pick up if it drops while you're doing something else 
and you win the roll, but otherwise you don't worry about it.

	Only four hundred DoN missions to almost catch up with an EP geared 
tank. What a bargain. I'm pretty sure I would slit my wrists around 
about the 339th creator, but then I'm weak, ill-informed, lazy etc.

	I'll be the first to admit it may well have been an iridescent purple 
herring, or even an iridescent purple ill-tempered sea-bass. But I'm 
pretty sure it's as relevant to this discussion as a can-can dancing 
banjo-playing fleuro-puce moose named Ted.

	Yep ok, those are out of reach to the bulk of pure single-groupers at 
this stage. That _may_ change once most single groupers are fully DoN 
geared and bored shitless with creators.

	I would imagine he is one of a very few velious-equivalent chanters who 
can 'basically solo' (Whatever that means) the entrance of Vxed & Tipt. 
Not that basically soloing the entrance to Tipt will get you into KT, 
even after the massive KT requirements nerf. I can 'basically solo' the 
entrance to Tipt with my DoN-ish SK by kiting... there's no way in hell 
I can complete Tipt with him though.

	Thank god I don't need to since we charm-cheated it the week after GoD 
came out :P

	<sigh> remembering when I was gearing up for BoT. Anyway, could you 
please submit a table of what gear you feel is appropriate for a 
single-grouper-group to tackle RS, RCoD, WoS, DoN with.

	If I had to pick, I'd pick 'stupid' every time. And indeed, I find this 
concept plausable: that they accidentally nerfed the kewl dudes' BLOODY 
iksar monk twinks while trying and failing to solve a semi-imaginary 
problem that Raiding Warriors whined about.

	That sounds far-fetched, but I mean it, I really believe that's more 
likely than they actually saw what was happening in the 30-50 game and 
did something about it.

	I really don't want to get into AC vs HP here :) Suffice to say I've 
read one or two novels worth of debate on it all over the web, and that 
it's nowhere near as clear cut as the above paragraph makes out :)

	It's also crap-tacularly class dependant. I believe the latest monk 
theory is that your soft cap arrives at about 100 worn AC. (for example)

	Can't argue there :) The shielding (tiny as it seems) is THE reason I 
bid on that item. Don't tell the other tanks in my guild that though, I 
have a feeling they missed a memo on shielding.

	Anyhow, why don't you get a haste aug? That's what I did and it means 
I'm never tied to a particular haste item.
