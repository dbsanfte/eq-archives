I have explored all sorts of highly level inapropriate areas in EQ2.  EQ2 
is trivial to avoid death in, all you have to do is run away.  I have 
completed many of the quests that require nothing more than visiting all 
sorts of places while all the mobs around me were very deep red to me.  
There are some places you will run into mobs that stun or root you, in 
which case you just run back, get your shard, and continue on with 
exploring.

Can't speak to the other games other than EQ, but I do disagree with your 
assesment of the exporability of EQ2.  There are places where you will 
have to level up enough to access the zones, but then those exist in EQ1 
as well.
