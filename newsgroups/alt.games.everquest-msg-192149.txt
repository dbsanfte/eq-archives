questions.  If you are running zone alarm Pro and are having trouble
making it work with everquest. Here is the Solution

1.Open Zone Alarm

2. Go to Program Control then Select The Program's Tab

3. Find Everquest in the list of programs

4.Right Click on Everquest in the list of program's

5.Check off the option that says changes Frequently

firewall.
