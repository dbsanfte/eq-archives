What player feedback? If the RvR is so bad why bother with the zone?

The vulgar juvenile tripe that I have seen on their boards isn't worth
the time it takes to read it. I doubt they are even capable of giving
intelligent feedback. How (or why) would anyone want to work with
"guilds like these"? You would have a more enriching experience
cleaning the monkey cages at the LA Zoo.

The players chose to exploit of their own free will. Using an exploit,
because Verant didn't fix the zone fast enough for their tastes was
their decision (and a bad one at that). Don't blame their actions on
Verant. If the zone was that buggy, then the smart move would have
been to raid somewhere else.
