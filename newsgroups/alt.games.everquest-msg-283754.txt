This wasn't supposed to be like the "beginning of Everquest" - this
is *NOT* a classic server.  Anyone who wishes for that is just plain
stupid.  You have no idea just how aggravating and unfun it was in
1999 to run the length of the continent to play with friends, just
to not be able to get a bind.

Please - the power of players compared to mobs in the sub-50 game has
grown so much that, if you think they're tough now, you certainly
couldn't have handled the originals.
