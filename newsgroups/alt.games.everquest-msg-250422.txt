Welcome back!  With the steady departure of old familiar faces, it's
always nice to see some sticking around.

Well, prior to the DX9/Collision system patch that made me
stop playing, I was terribly non-plused with the desireability
of my mage in GoD.  

There have been some improvements, however:

Rathe's son had it's base damage mitigation improved so
it was better than WoX.  Additionally, Pet Foci now boost
mitigation and level.

Before the change, using WoX as the baseline they were
Water  - -5%
Earth  - -5%
WoX    -  0%
Warriors 43%

DPoC adds 10% (for mage pets, less for Necro/BL)
Each level after that adds 2% more mitigation.
With the boost in innate mitigation that RS got,
the very best GoD focus boosts it up to 23% compared 
to a elemental warrior at 43%

Add in the pet defensive AA's, and apparently mages
can pet-tank/nuke in tier 3 now.

My last sojourn in GoD mobs still ripped my pets a
new one, however.  I've heard their attack values
were adjusted downward since then.

An awful lot of mages are still pretty unhappy with
the state of the class, however.  We've seen a large
number of long time, high profile, mages leave the
class or leave EQ completely.
