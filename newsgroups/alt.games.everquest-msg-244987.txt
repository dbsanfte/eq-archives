You know I never thought i'd have to explain my posting habbits to somebody
here...

Im sure there are times that I go for quite some time without posting here,
I mean im sorry to say but I do have a life outside of the NG.  Sometimes
work, home, even game issues draw my time and attention that would otherwise
be spent in here.  Gasp, sometimes I go on holiday too.. and shock horror,
sometimes there just isn't anything in the NG worth responding to for
periods of time.

I don't feel like spamming useless shit in the NG at quiet times, just to
create some noise at quiet times.. and i typically avoid reading posts from
people that do such things

So yeah, im sure its quite possible somebody relatively new to the NG could
have never seen a post by me.. (ignorance is still no defence or excuse
though, if you don't do your homework before opening up the flames)
