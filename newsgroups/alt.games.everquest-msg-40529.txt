IIRC, the left number is ping time, the right number is packet size, the
left middle number is receive (could be transmit) packet loss, the right
middle number is packet loss in the other direction.  Unless the ping time
is getting seriously high (for bards the requirement is more stringent),
then the important numbers are the two middle ones for packet loss.  Just
out of curiosity, is everyone experiencing packet loss on a fairly regular
basis for the past few weeks now?  I often see 0.0%, but fairly frequently
it hovers at a small number 3% or so, with huge spikes at times,
particularly when I am playing in OT it seems.
