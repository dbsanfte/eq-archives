Macros are not the same thing as spell slots. They just reiterated
recently that no, there will not be more than 8 spell slots ever and
not with Luclin either. 

Its not that they can't fit more spell slots over there, they
certainly could, its that for gameplay they want you to have to choose
the 8 you have to use for difficulty.
