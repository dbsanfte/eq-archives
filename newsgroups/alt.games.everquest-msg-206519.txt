Well, i live in Denmark, we pay 25% tax on normal goods, more on luxury 
items (dont even try to ask about the cost of a car), so 17.5% is less 
than i should usually have payed, so could be worse.

But what i think is REAL interesting about this is:
Do Sony pay the EU the money they collect in taxes, or do they just use 
this as a cheap way to get more cash for themselves?
