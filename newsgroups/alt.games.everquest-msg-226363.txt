Honestly; probably not.

But that would be because it would be around 5-10 bucks; which is a very 
fair price for a 'making of disk with a free action figure'.

Then again if they only bundled it with the XBOX game for 70.00 then I'd 
be outraged again. (Seeing as I don't have or want an xbox).

Oh wait... for the comparison to be the same I have to make sure that 
the local Famous Players theatre is giving away a couple if you enter 
some contest on their site (and win, of course). That way you can say if 
I don't like buying a useless xbox game... I could always win one.
