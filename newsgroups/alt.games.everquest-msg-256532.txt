The air pet was my favorite when grouping as its stuns will up its
aggro quickly and the tank taunting afterward was placing himself much
higher on the hate list than when I used a less aggro pet.  The air
pet was my moderate preference when solo since I could outrun a
stunned mob.

Earth pet was my favorite when I needed to split when soloing.  I just
backed far away and summoned a new one before the mobs could close in
on me.  Have stacks of malachite. It was also good at rooting a mob so
I could get away.  The malo line seems to be there just so the pet's
spells can actually work reliably. Groups tend to hate the fact the
pet roots until there's is no snarer; then the root is worth it for
stopping runners. 

Water is a good pet in a group too.  Position it to hit the mobs from
behind with "/pet guard here" and wait for the puller to bring in the
mobs.  

Fire pets were weak on HPs.  Today, summoned pet gear from the bazaar
and/or some HP buff can turn them into very good tanks.  The pet's DS
is useless in a group because player tanks will get hit first, but the
pet won't need HP gear or HP buffs unless you are fighting mobs that
do area of affect damage.
