Mobs treat sitting people as level 1's.  That results in greater
aggro range -- and just more aggro -- than would be the case if
the same person was standing.  Ever notice that you can walk
right by a green-con bear, for instance, but it will attack you
if you sit down to med?

So, to "sit pull," the puller goes to just outside the normal aggro
range of a KoS mob and sits.  That increases the aggro range of the
mob which will then attack the sitting person.  The puller then
stands up and heads back to the group.  Since the person didn't
attack the mob at its spawn point it normally won't cause multiple
pulls unless the mob tracks close to another of its type and/or
the puller sits within the expanded aggro range of more than one
mob.  (So the puller normally walks forward, sits to see if they're
close enough, stands and repeats until the mob aggros.)
