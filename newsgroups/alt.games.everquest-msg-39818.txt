The herbalists pack from Crystal caverns and the arch pack from perma 
are both good and similar. All of those are lore so its good that 2
very similar ones are in the game now. 

Herbalists drops A LOT from the herbalist and people are always trying
to get the OTHER things from it. If anything you could go there and
kill orcs and such and /ooc sometimes to please be told if the lore
herbalist pack drops and someone already has it. If you pick some area
(my favorite is just inside and the 3 spawn alcove along the left
wall) and just kill the 3 or 4 spawns around there it spawns
moderately fast while you are fairly safe from trains.

The best is really the Evil Eye bag (within your price range probably)
I ALWAYS see this thing sold for 400 plat or less by players. That is
a bargain really. Its a 70 percent weight reducing bag (was thought to
be 75 for a long time I think but such bags clearly say the reduction
now)

Another okay weight reducing bag along the same lines as the archy or
herbalists is a free one for doing a quest in Kerra ridge( yes, part
of the Black Hole area that is toxula that eventually no one goes to
no matter how many stupid trivial loot themed zones they drop in the
area) 

I think herb and archy are 25 percent.

The one from the kerra quest is 20 percent (still nice... and since
these are all lore good to have also) I think it called ransackers
something.

I got another one from Kaesora I think.. which if doing the area
everyone you are with will get eventually I think it was also 20 or
25.

I have all of the ones I've just mentioned and the Evil eye bag, yeah
I know, at 55 I should just invest in tink bags but I'm cheap and find
that as a druid mostly I have food and stuff in all my bags or trade
things and 20 or 25 percent is really plenty for me. Any rare heavy
weapon I get to sell I toss in the Evil Eye bag.

Handmade player backpacks are now 10 percent.. but that is fairly
negligeable to a shaman who is already pretty strong probably.
