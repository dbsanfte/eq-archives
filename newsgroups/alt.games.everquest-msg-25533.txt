Hello again,

Okay so I've set it up to disable call waiting whenever I go online. 
I've hit control alt delete while the funny cursor thing is happening
to see if any other program is running and the only things are EQ,
Rnaap which is my dial up,  3cmlnkw which has something to do with the
dial up or modem as well and explorer.  Nothing seems to be running in
the background and this still happens!  It's been happening an average
of 2 times a night.  I also have an issue with getting kicked back to
the log in server after the character select screen and sometimes when
zoning but as that seems to be a more common problem and doesn't
affect me too much in game I can handle that.  I just can't figure it
out!  When I exit out of EQ the cursor/hourglass continues to freak
out until I restart the computer.  Is everyone out of ideas?  I guess
the next step is to try tech support.  Is there any possibility it's
related to the modem or ISP?  Ack!! I am at my wits end!
