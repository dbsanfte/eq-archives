Feel free to provide links. There are certainly times when STR-atk
doesn't do much.. but the same could be said of attack-atk at that
time.

To expand, my understanding of the situation is this.

You have an attack rating.. the mob has an AC rating. If your attack
rating is significantly below the mob AC rating.. you normally hit for
the minimium. When you get in the range of the mob's AC with your
attack.. you hit for your weapons modal value. When you get
significantly over your mob's AC with your attack rating you start
hitting for the max.

The reverse is true when dealing with AC. If your AC rating is
signifcantly below a mobs atk.. he hits you for the max. As your AC
gets in the range of his atk... your AC mitigates a lot of the damage
and he hits for his modal. And as your AC gets over top of his atk..
he hits more for the minimum. Once he hits for the minimum more AC
won't give significant returns and most people confuse this for a soft
AC cap. As a result.. in the Luclin era most people thought there was
a soft-AC cap of around 1350AC.. and it was half true. They definately
noticed more AC didn't make a difference.. but that was mainly because
they had crossed a point where they met the mob with the highest
attack, so at 1350AC you mitigated across the board. As expansions
have been released.. the attack ratings of mobs have gone higher and
higher.. so more AC in those expansions does in fact make a
considerable difference.

Really.. when it comes down to it you need as much attack as you can
get via STR, worn atk, ranger atk buffs, shaman avatar or primal, etc.
to try to get significantly above mob AC in order to max hit..
especially if playing newer expansions. That's why rogues.. rangers...
and every other melee damage class just creams their pants for attack
buffs on raid. Its also why mob attack debuffs are incredibly
important.
