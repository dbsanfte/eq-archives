I couldn't disagree more.

Those mobs will be there next week.  But you'll never again be the first person to
explore a PoP zone, to kill mob X, to get Phat Lewt Y, to find a new use for
discipline Z, to get skill A, to... well to explore, instead of visit places and
things and abilities others have already played around with.

I didn't buy RoK until a couple months after release.  I got SoV the day it came
out... and ever since that, heavily regretted not getting RoK faster.  SoL just
reinforced that feeling, and PoP is much the same.

Taking time off from the same old same old, in order to explore the new, is giving
up little to get something irreplacable.

Further, we all are aware that drop rates are always screwy in a new expansion for
the first week or so.  Yes, in some cases this means mobs that should drop
something nice drop crap.  But in others it means some of the great gear or quest
items drop off relatively easy mobs, or too frequently.  This means that explorers
(who aren't farming some one mob, so they don't get hit hard by the "dropping crap"
part) get rewarded heavily, while the people that follow behind end up having to
pharm for weeks to get the same items.

Go kill post patch mob pops with a new expansion up?  Sorry, I can't make it today,
try me in a week.

If the guild removes me for that, well they don't get it, and who wants to be in a
guild that doesn't get it.
