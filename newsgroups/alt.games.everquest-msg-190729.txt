Yes, at absolute tanking, a warrior should be the best, it's his job.

But it's not a separate issue.  The fact is that a warrior can only do one
thing, and that's tank in groups.  If that's all he's got, then he should be
best at it.  That is the crux of our argument.  His inability to solo
becomes a huge issue, as there has to be something to balance that out, and
that's his primacy as a tank.  If a warrior could solo (say, through a
better regen rate), then I wouldn't be insisting that he should be the
absolute best tank.

When dealing with class balance issues like this, you can't look at each
part in a vacuum.

1)  You can't use "and you want that too."  -I- don't want it.  Remember, I
play a Paladin - arguably the second best tank class in the game.  Don't try
to make it sound like I'm selfishly trying to take something away from you.
If I got my way on the issue, I would stand to loose a little bit more to
bring Warriors up to where they should be.

2)  The problem at hand isn't that warriors are encroaching on our
territory, it's that SOE's failure to find an adequate role for the knight
classes is forcing us into their's.  Again, SOE takes the easy road, instead
of seeking the path to true class balance.

Funny, I thought it was about druids and necromancers.  Anyways, it's not
about clerics and warriors, almost everyone has a role to play, with the
exception of the knight classes.  That should be our issue, finding a way
for us to contribute without taking away from the -only- thing a warrior can
do.  They started on that road with the SK aggro buff/debuff.

Just like a cleric would legitimately be able to complain if a druid could
suddenly heal better then he could.  Just like an enchanter would
legitimately complain if a bard was suddenly better at crowd-control.  I'd
say the warriors' complaints are well justified.
