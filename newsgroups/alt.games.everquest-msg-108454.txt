I made a new necro.  Yippee, right?

My little experience in EQ equates to this:

41 Bard 1/2 elf (love it!!!)
26 Necro human (got bored with it after making bard)
11 Ranger 1/2 elf (not too bad, rarely use it though)
7 Enchanter (booooring!)
and now 10 gnome necro.

I really liked the human necro, but having made it about a week into the
game at most, he was lacking from the start (i.e., He's a big necro!  Let's
put a few points into strength for some tanking power!  DOH!!).  I really
enjoyed the class, but by 26 I saw his feeble Human and bad point-allocation
mixture a little frustrating.

<Enter new, improved Necromancer 2.0>

I love it again.  Not too far into it, but I can solo yellows no problem.  I
couldn't do that with the other one from day 1, due to my newbieness (is
that a word??) and bad character creation.  I ACTUALLY HAVE A MANA POOL
NOW!!!
Exp was flying in like crazy.  It still is, but am now wondering if I
understand it a bit more and have a clean slate, or if the general ease was
from Verant nerfing the first 10 levels.  I would assume a little of both,
but I remember how hard it was to get my necro up before, he was in fact a
bit of a sissy physically and intelligence-wise.

The only thing I remember being the same is the "poorness" of a new
character.  My bard didn't seem to have too much of a problem keeping
somewhat financed.  With the necro, I can barely afford the minimum
necessity spells.  I will most likely dump the stuff from 26 necro to this
one, yet that might take some of the fun out of it for me.
Anyway, I suppose I should make this rant actually mean something, eh?

Here's my point:
Necros are cool and powerful!

Here's my question:
I haven't made a character since Verant tweaked the beginning game.  How
much easier has it REALLY been made to be??
Keep in mind, I don't mean no exp loss and spawning with all your stuff
(I've only died once, so that doesn't matter to me), has anything else been
tweaked?  Like exp modifiers or anything?

Forever a newbie,
SEAN...
