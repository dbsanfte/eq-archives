Aye, that's why I eventually stopped raiding (where I rarely died) and stuck 
with GoD mostly on my own and with out-of-guild friends. That was 
challenging and it was fun leading people through the tipt and vxed trials 
at a time when they were virtually unknown and unexplored. That was indeed 
the edge at the time.
