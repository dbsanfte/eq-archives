There's a VERY few items that work with HoT spells to extend their
duration but I'm sure that pretty much all of them are Vex Thal or
elemental/Time loot.  Normal Extended Enhacement items (and the 8th
shawl) don't work because those only work on spells that last for at
least 48 seconds. There is one augment out there, I forget the name,
that works with HoT spells and acts as a 10% buff extension. 

Other than that, spell casting reinforcement is what you need to get
more effiiciency out of HoTs. SCRM will get you at least 6 (usually 7)
ticks out of a HoT.
