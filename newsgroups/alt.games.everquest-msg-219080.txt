Yes, at POP release; eliminating all vestiges of travel shrank
the world for the lowbies, but worse were the planes themselves;
a series of outdoor zones with extraordinary experience coupled
with the abscence of any real alternatives over level 61: For the
high level players the entire game shrank down to just a handful
of new zones, and then trials et al further split those people
apart from their friends who weren't quite ready to make the
shift up to the next level.  And instead of ten levels, they
added only 5 short ones, each the equivalent of two normal levels
in terms of power increase but taking only half the effort to
reach; this meant that the top end people raced thru the new
levels like never before.

Instead of -expanding- the game began to contract.

They've tried to put the genie back in the bottle, reducing POP
exp under the guise of a solo nerf, expanding the "blue range" of
the post 60 crowd back to where it should have been... but like
Happy Days post shark, its never going to be the same.

They added new expansions: LOY was largely a flop because having
given everyone easy travel, they then put the entire expansion
out in the boonies, 4 zones or more away from a POK port, and
even then you have to move thru still more content to get to
stuff appropriate for your level unless you are at the low end of
the expansion's utility.  Largely ignored, this makes it just a
lot more "bring your own group if you can find anyone to come
with you" content like most of of the zones in earlier expansions
are now; there's not one Sebelis or Maiden's Eye among them.

Now LDoN comes out, addressing the accessibility issue of LOY,
but tuned sloppily; only two settings, with Normal too easy to
challenge any but the worst groups, and Hard difficult enough to
please but featuring poor reward for the added risk; this means
everyone keeps doing "normal" and trying not to fall asleep; in
pre LDoN content it was always possible to find something a
little harder with a little better reward, or easier with
slightly worse reward... because you made the choices of what to
face yourself, instead of having the game pick for you.

All in all, starting with POP (well, really in some ways the
trend began even earlier with the spires in Luclin) the world's
been getting smaller and there's been less realistic choice
unless you are willing to deliberately buck the system and follow
a less than optimal path.

For those that -are- individual enough to go out on their own,
dragging friends along where they can find them, the world's the
largest its ever been, and keeps getting larger.  I'm sure there
were good things about the post shark Happy Days too, but all I
can picture is Fonzie as an high school auto shop teacher.
