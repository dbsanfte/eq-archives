The idea that "evil" is entirely subjective has nothing to do with pop
culture. Philosophers throughout history have made that observation.

And recognizing that what Hitler and Stalin did, while seeming evil by
common current subjective opinion very probably did not seem evil to
them, is simply an acknowledgement of the fact that evil is
subjective. It's not at all the same thing as being an apologist. Or a
hedonist.
