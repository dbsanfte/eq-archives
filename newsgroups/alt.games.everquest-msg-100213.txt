True , Dan. But some people like to have enchanters along for both the clarity
and the possibility of using Rune in the fight. It is not necessary because if
the fight last long enough for people to need clarity, the fight is lost
already. And with VS (light), Rune is just an added advantage not a necessity as
it often is for VS (hard).

Back on topic. Of those times I ran VS (light) raids, I cannot say I always won.
I did win the first time I ran a raid there and we only had 2 groups. The key
thing is that if you main tank dies, you will be hurting. If your main tank is
not allowed a sufficent time to gain agro on VS (light), you will be hurting.
All the times I failed in the raid, our main tank died in the first couple
seconds of the fight or because people did not wait long enough before assisting
the main tank. Much like the Meistro in Hate, VS moves quickly and is hard to
hit when he is being Ping-Ponged. If he is not stuck on one person fighting, the
group will be hurting.

Will a new person fail? It is possible. Can they succeed while never being in
one before? Most defently. If they have general raid techniques and knowledge
and apply them to VS (light), they will have a good chance on winning. As stated
before, get a good main tank and a good set of clerics and the battle will
mostly be won then.
