Read the articles.  Don't waste my time.  The following was taken out from
the very same article you bring into question.
Did you NOT see this?!  PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ IT ENTIRELY AND
THOROUGHLY BEFORE YOU JUDGE!

"Regulations governing detention in the Occupied Territories

Arrest and detention by Israeli security services in the Occupied
Territories are governed by a series of Israeli military orders which, for
years, have given the Palestinians of the Occupied Territories rights which
are inferior to the rights of Israeli citizens and breach international
standards for arrest and detention.

International human rights instruments lay down the following guarantees,
among others, to people who are arrested or detained. These guarantees must
be applied to all without discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex,
language, religion, political opinion, social origins, birth or other
status:

  a.. The right not to be arbitrarily arrested.
  a.. The right to be informed of the reasons for arrest.
  a.. The right of access to lawyers.
  a.. The right to inform or have informed their families of their arrest
and place of detention.
  a.. The right to be brought promptly before a judge.
  a.. The right to challenge the lawfulness of detention.
  a.. The right to have access to the outside world.
  a.. The right to be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent
dignity of the human person.

Few Palestinians living in the Occupied Territories who have been arrested
or detained by the Israeli security forces enjoy these rights. Palestinians
in the Occupied Territories (apart from those with Jerusalem ID cards)
arrested by Israeli security services are under a system of military
justice. The law which has governed arrest and detention of Palestinians
over the past 32 years has been Military Order No. 378. This order was
issued in 1970 and has been frequently amended. Palestinians may be arrested
without warrant and without ''reasonable suspicion'' that a person has
committed any criminal offence. The arresting body, the IDF or the Israeli
General Security Service (GSS)(2), does not directly inform families of
those arrested, but provides information to Israeli non-governmental
organizations such as HaMoked, Centre for the Defense of the Individual,
which families may contact (if they are aware of the organizations'
existence). Until 1994 those arrested could be held for up to 18 days
without judicial review; in 1994 the period without access to a judge was
reduced to 11 days and in 1997 it was reduced to eight days."

is this fair treatment?!  oh, wait... you aren't capable of rational,
unbiased thought. You wouldn't be able to answer that question.
WAKE UP!  or maybe i should...... debating against teh stubborn, senseless
is truly a WASTE OF MY TIME.

Visit my other links provided in both "challenge" posts.  You have yet to
deal with them!  or maybe you're simply afraid of your argument being proved
completely false..... as i noted earlier.
