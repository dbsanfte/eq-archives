No trivials are listed on Casters Realm, but I would guess they are a
few tens of points higher than their non-imbued counterparts (I'm
assuming here that it would be like wood-elf smithing/tailoring, the
thing I imbue gems for).

Also, spot the deliberate mistake - should have been 'platinum' not
'golf' (?!? let me sacrifice a chicken over my keyboard to appease the
spelling and typing demons). Now:

Imbued electrum fire opal ring, AC 2, STR -4, INT 4, HP 10, mana 25, sv
fire 2

Imbued gold fire opal ring, AC 3, STR -6, INT 6, HP 10, mana 35, sv fire
3

Imbued platinum fire opal ring, AC 4, STR -8, INT 8, hp 10, mana 45, sv
fire
4, BRD, WIZ


The trivials for non-imbued versions of these are 125 for electrum,
somewhere from 202-218 for gold, Platinum unknown, probably not trivial
at 250. Imbued would be higher, so I guess you're looking for a
grandmaster jeweller. If none of your jeweller friends are good enough,
get all the bits and keep an ear out for someone auctioning Velium
jewellery - they shouldn't charge you too much to just hit the combine
button for you.
