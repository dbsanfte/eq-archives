I guess this relates back to the open letter from John Smedley about the
problems with Everquest.

As far as I know John Smedley is the CEO of Sony's Online Entertainment
section.  I know he was involved in the design and first implementation of
Everquest - but how much does he have to do with the day to day operation of
the game now?

Sure he might have a rough idea of what is going on in the game - but when
was the last time he actually played it?

The sense of foreboding that I get from the that letter points towards the
end of Everquest more than other thing up to this point.
