My computer is similar in RAM and CPU, but with only a TNT2 card.  I've had
to move the clipping pane in quite a ways to fix it.  Not sure if it's a
problem on Verant's end or if my setup is simply not up to rendering the
more detailed scenery at the necessary rate.  I also turned off dynamic
lighting, because I'm not sure if it's supported in the TNT2 hardware.  As
for that, you have no worries.  Hopefully, the clipping pane thing is only
necessary for a short time as a workaround.
