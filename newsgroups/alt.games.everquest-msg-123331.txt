Druid.  Have to scale back a little, kill dark blues and even
cons instead of all reds and yellows... but there's no
real need for equipment at all.

My son took my little druid out for a joyride a few months
ago, died, and didn't tell me about it, I didn't log him on
for more than a week, and so all my gear evaporated.  To
date I've replaced perhaps 5 slots with gear, and there's
no noticable reduction in power, other than those red
cons where I used to go from FM to OOM... now I
don't have  a mana pool deep enough for that to work.

Beastlord, no reagent for pet summon, smart beastlords
are HtH skill based.  Slows, hastes, Complete Heal (pet only)
this class is largely good to go out of the box...

Cleric... while admittedly I have half the mana pool
naked as I do dressed, I do still have the capability
of casting several CHeals, as well as roots stuns
MOK and the all important rez.  I have to watch
aggro much more closely with about a quarter
of my HP and almost all AC missing.  If it matters,
I can even summon a weapon to beat greens over the
head with.

Bard.  OK, no super high speed selos, but selos
with no drum is still as fast as a level 9 shaman SOW.
No string instrument, means the heal while you
fight boost is only half as good.  No Flute, so
you Can't invis no how no way.  But you can
still charm and selo enough to stay out of
reach, and can DD/DOT/Selo your pet
to death afterwards... heck, 90% of the killing
I do I might just as well be stark raving naked
for all it matters.  Often I think I am... At level
35 I'm still wearing several pieces of Loda Kai
(drops off level 10 to 15 mobs in shadeweaver,
less AC than banded no stats) and haven't really
got much reason to seek better.
