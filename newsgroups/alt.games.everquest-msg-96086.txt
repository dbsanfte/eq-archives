First off, all of the combat graphics are horrible and rigid looking. Why did 
they change the way Ogres/Trolls slam? And females are a little too well 
endowed.

Barbarian Male: Excellent, standing/running, love the new
    faces, beards, and hair. Armor styles are an improvement.

Barbarian Female: Below Avg/Bad. Standing, could they look more stiff please?
    Running, would someone please remove the pole from her ass? Faces are good
    some of the hairstyles are stupid looking. Armor looks good on them.

Dark Elf Male: Average/Good. Standing they look like they are about
    fall on their faces. When looking at them run from a rear view, they run
    like little girly-men. Armor looks good on the whole, banded is much
    improved, but a step backwards with the plate helm..

Dark Elf Female: Good. Faces, hair all look good. Less stiff when running than
    Barbarian females, but stiffer nonetheless. Armor is good, but the plate
    helm is the second worst for females.

Dwarf Male/Female: Don't know, have them turned off, never cared much for them
    in EQ.

Erudite Male: Average/Good. Awkward runners though. Look great in
    Robes, and really good in full Flayed Skin. Haven't seen one in plate.

Erudite Female: Very attractive standing. Pole up the wazoo syndrome when
    running.

Gnome Male: Good. Faces and beards look good, some of the hairstyles look a
    little weird, but Gnomely. Most are robe wearers, and look good, but the
    new plate helm is the second worst male helm.

Gnome Female: Haven't seen any.

Half-Elf Male/Female: Awful/Awful. Is there a difference? By far the worst 
    models in the game. Faces look fine, but the penis helm is the worst for 
    both sexes in the whole game. Plate armor went from one of the best to one 
    of the worst. Pony-tails on the males.....enough said. After seeing them 
    the only reason I keep them on is to make fun of my Half-Elf bard friend.

Halflings: Hate halflings in EQ, turned off, if I could make them invisible,
    I would.

High Elf Male: When did the USC Trojan marching band get transported to Norrath?
    Good, and much improved. Looked simply retarded in the old graphics. Run
    like girls.

High Elf Female: Good. Faces and hair look very good. Pole in the rear. Leather
    armor makes them look like a dominatrix. I likes.

Human Male: Very good. Same stiff running problem Erudites have, but overall
    very good. Most improved plate helms for males hands down.

Human Female: Very good. Pole up the butt syndrome while running. Best plate
    helm graphic in the game hands down.

Iksar Male: Average. Can't complain about any aspect. Nothing outstanding 
    either. Just glad they got rid of those brown turd banded helms.

Iksar Female: Don't know, never see any.

Ogre Male: Very Good. Lack of choices when it comes to the faces, but not that
    big of a deal. Little bit stiff when running, but great look in all their
    armors except leather. Could do without the Aztec looking plate helms.

Ogre Female: Average. Better than they used to be. Same pole up the butt 
    syndrome that many other females endure.

Troll Male: Very Good/Excellent. Faces are all still menacing, running is
    awkward and stilted, but it fits a troll. Vast improvement in body 
    proportion. Plate armor looks great.

Troll Female: ?

Wood Elf Male: Average/Good. Faces all look fine. Same leaning forward
    problem that all the other elves have. Run like girls, but the new
    plate graphics look very good, and I like the new plate helm.

Wood Elf Female: Average/Good. Same problem with the pole that most females have
    Like their faces. Armor in general looks good on them.
