For one handed weapons, the bonus is strictly based on the level of the 
player, so, his damage bonus would be 9 on all 1 handed weapons.

Given that:
(9x2+9)/27 = 1.0
(15x2+9)/32 = 1.219

The Centi Warhammer is a better weapon for the primary hand.

(9x2+1)/27 = .704
(15x2+1)/32 = .969

It's also the better weapon for the off hand.

Best combination given those 3 weapons would be the centi warhammer with 
one of the Ulaks.  I believe that you will get the most DPS, by a bit, 
with the war hammer in your off hand.  The difference is small, but, it 
is there.
