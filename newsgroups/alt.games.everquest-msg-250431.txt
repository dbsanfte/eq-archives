And, IMO, those Alla users are going to tend to be the more hardcore people
who bark constantly about "dumbing down" the game.  I again don't think that
at all represents the general EQ playerbase.  There's a huge market for EQ
items and accounts.  Maybe Alla users aren't buying virtual property in EQ,
but a lot of people are.

I agree.

I agree that the decision has already been made.  At some point, SOE is
going to offer some kind of official mechanism for items and characters to
change hands.  A certain percentage of people will threaten to quit, a small
percentage of those people actually will quit, and who knows if it will
bring some other people back into the game or retain some who would have
left otherwise.
