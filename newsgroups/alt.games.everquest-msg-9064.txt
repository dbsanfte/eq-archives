Except the Coldain Velium weapons bought from vendors in Thurgadin. Those 
will proc starting at level 1. The stats are slightly better on the 
Coldain Velium weapons as well, so if you're looking for a nice present 
for a lower level character, you might hike to Thurg and take a look at 
the selection.
