I've still got it written down somewhere, but waaaaay back when the game was
new I found a spot in the Qeynos newbie area with insta-respawn.  At the
time, when *nobody* had 2 plat to rub together, I got "rich" off of newbie
droppings.  I'd have 20 or 30 corpses stacked up because I was afraid of
losing the mob that popped (it wandered off, so you had to kill it wherever
it was to get the spawning started).
