The Bloated Belly passes pretty close to that island before docking in The
Overthere. It's a short swim to the boat. If you stay on the boat it will,
eventually, head over to Ogre Island. Once there jump off the boat, just after
it leaves the dock, and swim around to the raft to Oasis of Marr. My Iksar
Monk's very familiar with this route so it's a safe and easy way to travel,
provided you're not worried about time of course. ;)
