Exactly. And in addition to that, if people hadn't been put off nuclear 
power by technophobe scaremongers for the last fifty years, perhaps 
enough investment would have been available for research, and we would 
have viable *fusion* plants by now.

I'm all with Greenpeace as far as the whales are concerned, but sometimes 
I think they won't stop until we have been driven back to the Bronce Age. 
Anybody else noticed that their support for wind farms turned to 
opposition as soon as they actually proved successful?
