OOC, nothing. I just think it'd be funny, and what's more anti-Iksar
than halflings? Maybe the Feir Dal. But why would Iksar be interested
in Faydwer?
IC:
They must learn fear. If Kithicor didn't do it, perhaps this will.
Also, Rivervale is a nice spot. Not as nice as Cabilis, mind, but it's
not in danger of flooding and is much closer to the temple of
Cazic-Thule. I think it would make a nice Iksar outpost.

The Iksar have been too complacent in their declining dominance of
Kunark. If we are to survive, we must expand beyond our own borders,
become a competing political and economic power, not just a military
power, and across all of norrath, not just Kunark. Rivervale is well
situated at a crossroads, providing alternate access across antonica,
and is already well fortified. I will lead the like-minded of Cabilis,
and those who have deemed themselves worthy of being called allies, to
the very gates of Rivervale. We shall convert it into a proper
fortress, an outpost from which the Iksar can stage economic, political
and military dealings with the other races of Norrath. If I have
learned anything from my travels, it is that continuing on our current
path of isolationism as our city crumbles around us will lead to our
once great nation and race becoming nothing more than a footnote in
some skinless tome of history, if not completely forgotten. It is a
destiny that must be avoided, and I will stop at nothing to prevent
this from coming to pass!
