Your logic is flawed, and so your conclusion is incorrect.  "... in a
pickup group of strangers NBG is a lie used to promote the greed of
players who only go where the loot they want drops" is true, tho it is
somewhat flawed due to its ambiguity.  Very little of human interaction
is accurately characterized by "universal truths", which makes it
absurd to read a description of human behavior, especially in a casual
context like this ng, as if it were meant to be a "universal truth"
unless it is expressed in a way that leaves no doubt as to intent.
If you wish to quarrel with that assertion, perhaps you would like to
start by explaining why psuedo-wisdom like "that's the exception that
proves the rule" (one of my least favorite cliches) enjoy such wide-
spread use and acceptance.

I always up for a good disagreement.  But abuse is often tiresome and
usually off topic, while simple contradiction becomes uninteresting
in a hurry.  This thread isn't too bad, so far.  :)
