I was simply stating some observations I have made with NT4, NT5 and 95/98.

A P3-866 is not a "high-end" processor by todays standards, nor is a $60
video card (GeForce2 MX 400).

If you are talking about the P2 family then that technology is *way* out for
date for the higher end gameplay of today and I would agreee with 98 over
2000.

2000 and XP are built for more "robust" systems, but for my money, the
stability is worth the "slight" performance loss.
