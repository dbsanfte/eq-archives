Nothing about LDoN when you click "advanced" on the patcher?
Peculiar... It should update the patcher on its own if it's even
slightly different from the current version. (Can't even re-skin the

I do not think witchcraft is a religion, and I do not think it is in any 
way appropriate for the U.S. military to promote it.

-- George W. Bush, October 15, 2000 

(Notice how Bush does away with the Wiccan's right to religious liberty
by redefining Wicca as not a religion and further denigrating it with 
the term witchcraft.)
