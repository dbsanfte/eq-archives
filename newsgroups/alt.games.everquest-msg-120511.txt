Yeah, Vendors will crank up thier prices mid-session. Doesn't matter if you
keep the trade window open or close and re-open it... once you hit the
'magic number' of any specific item, he'll switch... and not just for you,
but also for anyone else buying/selling that particular item from that
particular vendor.

Not a lot you CAN do except switch to a fresh vendor... right now, just
after a patch, is the best time because all Vendors and their inventories
have been reset.
