No no no.  Do not haste pets.  Aside from the fact that pet classes are
going to have a better pet only haste, there used to be a problem with haste
stacking where th ehigher level spell rather than the higher haste
percentage would overwrite.  I'm not entirely certain if this still exists
as I haven't played a pet class around this level in some time.  Either way
you'll be wasting your mana and possibly casusing some inconvenience to the
pets owner.  At 55 you will be using Alacrity for haste, just one level away
from Celerity, which is 40%.  A level 55 Necromancer will be using
Augmentation of Death (if she can get it, it is a bit of a rare spell),
which is 65% haste 55 strength and 15 ac, or if she has had difficulty
acquiring augmentation of death, then the level 39 Augment Death, which is
55% haste 45 strength and 12 ac.  Either way the moral of the story is don't
haste necromancer pets as the necromancer has something better up her sleve
or in this case in her spell book.  You could however toss some hp buffs the
pet's way if he might need to off tank something.

As to the topic of your usefullness.  If your group is killing mobs so
quickly that you needn't slow them, then help make the deaths a bit quicker.
Even with quick duration dots (generally poison and cursed based ones) it is
often more mana efficent to nuke.  Do a bit of math.  If your dots arent
lasting their full duration or near to it, then you are probably better off
nuking and getting stuff dead that much quicker.

Also, don't underestimate your usefullness.  Shaman buffs aren't exactly
underwhelming.  You can have a great empact on the overall effeciency of a
group in the way of regen and stat buffs.  Don't forget cc - slow and off
tank, or just root something out of the way.  There are plenty of ways for a
shaman to make or break a group all possible without ever doing any damage
to a mob.
