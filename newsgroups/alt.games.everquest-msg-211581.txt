Thats bullshit for a start - take a look at chimps and their sexual
practises for maintainance of hierarchy.

Its exists in nature without an artifical human or other intervention -
therefore its natural, your justifications for it are overly hung
up on genetics....even if you want to drop to a hard biological
perspective the 'it limits reproduction so its bad' argument doesnt hold
up because a) homosexuality is in a minority and it could only threaten
the species from a biological perspective if it was a very large
percentage, b) it only takes a few men to impregnate women and perpetuate
the species anyway, c) relevant to human society we can have gay men and
lesbian women generate children with each other anyway so its not a block
d) there are plenty of examples of non reproducing animals contirubting to
species survival and being able to claim genetic success by relatedness
ranging from ant colonies in the invertebrates up to 'uncle' lions - gay
people can be soldiers, scientists, builders, doting relatives who help
with a brother or sister's childcareand so much more - and as such can end
up contributing much much more to society than a straight person who goes
off the rails and lives down and out for their life - in the case of
looking after a relatives child thats half a child relation equivalent
genetically (since you like genetics so much - and yes it IS a recognised
measure of biological success. Ive sat in too many lectures on the
subject in my life to have missed the point).
