Pretty much forget it since its content 99.9 percent of the players
will never take part in. Basically sometimes in a gm quest (we all
know how often those happen!) if you somehow play a part that gets
noticed, in all the chaos, you may get rewarded with a coin from a gm.
You then would turn it in to someone like that kizrak guy, for
example, at which point if very lucky you'll get something which kind
of sucks for your character. If not very lucky you won't even be able
to use the item you get, which will probably be no drop.
