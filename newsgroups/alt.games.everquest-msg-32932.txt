Heh. He hates my guts now, after countless faction hits from doing the
Stein of Moggok quest. And he has a huge aggro radius too... I just
turner the corner of the throne room (I wanted to /con him to see how
badly my faction had been hit) and he got off his butt and started
running after me, spewing abuse... I think I must have broken all my
indoors "dash for the zone" records. Luckily, everything else in Kaladim
is amiable to me.

Now, every time I port someone to BB, I make a point of dropping a few
bone chips at the paladin guild, to make amends.
