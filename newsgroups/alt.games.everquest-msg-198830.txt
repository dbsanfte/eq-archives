Just goes to show how much they know about the game, that's completely 
false.  I've LDed while tradeskilling, come back on to find the items in 
the container.  Only ways you will lose items are if the zone goes down, or 
another player takes the items out of the container while you don't have it 
open.  No Drop items behave differently from tradable gear.  No Drop items 
will always poof as soon as the tradeskill container is closed, regardless 
of the reason it is closed. (Well, there was a bug for a while that allowed 
others to interrupt your tradeskilling, and get items, but that was fixed 
some time back.)

The only items that will poof on closing the tradeskill container are No 
Drop items.  They will poof whether you go LD, camp out, or just close the 
container.  But, then, you wouldn't be transferring those items, as you 
can't anyway.

I would suggest that another player snagged the items out of the container, 
or the item(s) were No Drop.  I have used tradeskill containers for 
transferring items for a long time, the only time I have had a problem was 
when someone took the items out of the container, and, he gave them to me 
without any arguments.
