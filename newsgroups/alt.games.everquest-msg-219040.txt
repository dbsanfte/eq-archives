And on this issue is the crux of our dissagreement; in another post
I've written practically a mini-novel discussing this, so I'll just
point you to it.  I'm just not looking forward to all the people
hating me for my tiny heart that is black as coal and cold as ice.

So far I don't have even one supporter or one person saying they can
even *kind of* understand my viewpoint, so it seems I'm patrolling a
pretty darned lonely place.  Nonetheless I feel compelled to share my
opinions.

: and fight to preserve their right to make that choice again. 
: Even if you don't agree with it. That is freedom.

It's interesting how you mention 'freedom' but yet inform me of
my responsibility to support other people's oftimes foolish
'choices' (aka rolling the dice even if the odds are terrible).
That doesn't make me *feel* very free.

: Of course. You are welcome to take someone elses choice, evaluate it

: where it must stop. If you take the next step and meet out consequenses 
: against them because they failed you're test you've gone too far.

Ah, but it doesn't have to stop there.  I'm exercising my right to
freedom of speech.  George W. Bush hasn't taken *that* away...yet.

: Suggesting they should be shot, even for dramatic effect is pretty 
: hurtful...

It was beyond foolish for me to phrase it that way.  :(  I'd go back
in time and delete the post, if I could.

Alas, I do suffer from arrogance sometimes.  At times I feel above
the foolish herd of sheep on this planet, and at other times I feel
lower than scum that will never amount to anything.

: The church cannot satisfy the rest of humanity that it is the ultimate 
: authority, and so is unsuitable to judge us. Convincing a few of us

Yes, I agree with you, but there are those who don't.

: And everyone else works to set up a system where the politos, soldiers, 
: fanatics and whatever can do the least amount of damage.

...or those people are brainwashed into thinking they must give up
essential liberties in order to keep themselves safe from "the
evildoers".  Or those people who are happy enough to work their 8
hours and come home to their TV sets.  I'd say the majority of the
Earth's population just goes along for the ride.  Some people have
to take the initiative to keep those who crave power or authority
at bay.  That's why I enjoy flaming George W. Bush on Usenet.  The
man would shove his sick brand of Christianity down all our throats
if he could.  Fortunately he has just enough brain cells to keep
barely on this side of politically correct, but his true feelings,
motives, and desires are pretty clear to anyone willing to look.

I agree.

Teckla...the expresser of uber-unpopular opinions...  Who still has
a lingering hope that someone feels the same way.  Because otherwise,
I'm clearly insane.
