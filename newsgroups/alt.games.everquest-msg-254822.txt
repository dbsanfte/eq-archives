So, it has taken me roughly 24 hours of play time to get my Paladin to 
level 9, but I'm there. I'm looking at the spells I have to choose from 
and I wonder at the usefulness of one, curious on people's take.

The spell "Cease" says it stuns my target for 1 second. How freaking 
useful is that? Is the point of that spell so you can flee? Are there 
benefits to a 1 second stun that I just don't know about yet?
