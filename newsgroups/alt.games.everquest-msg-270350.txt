Seems likely.

My guess is that they figure the bulk of their long-term player base
will be hitting the level cap around the time they release their first
expansion.  If that's the case, they'll balance the bulk of the
expansion content to target level-capped players.

Anyway, it's just far too early to say anything about the long-term
appeal of either EQ2 or WoW.
