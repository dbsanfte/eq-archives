Is it a one-time deal?  So the next 100hps that are dealt to you get
absorbed, and after that the shield is gone and pops off your buff list?

If so, it doesn't seem a lot different than a heal, except that you can have X hit
points more than you normally start with.  Are there cases other than
an emergency heal (cleric out of mana) where it's worth the component cost?
