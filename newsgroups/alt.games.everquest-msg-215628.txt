Hi

could someone please point me in the direction of a good beginners guide? or
even drop a few tips. ive started as a human paladin and im currently level
4 in freeport. but besides killing stuff and selling items i dont know what
to do. if i hail an NPC's they give me a brief message about who they are
and one even suggested i start a quest but i dont know how to accept. how do
i go about joining a guild etc? any tips would be helpful

Cheers

Keith
