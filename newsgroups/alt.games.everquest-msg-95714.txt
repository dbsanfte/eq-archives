considering i wrote the curernt exp split calculations in showeq, i'd be
happy
to share

group split is performed in the following fashion.  First, determine the
number
of people in your group, and apply the following exp bonus.

solo, no bonus
2 people, 2% bonus
3 people, 6% bonus
4 people, 10% bonus
5 people, 14% bonus
6 people, 20% bonus

ok, now take the exp a mob gives, which is equal to (mob lvl)^2 * ZEM
in this case, ZEM is 75 for most outdoor zones, 80 for some dungeons, 85
for some others, and it maxes out at 100 for underused zones and some
especially difficult ones.

take this experience, and apply the proper bonus.  This is the exp that will
be
split amongst the group.  Now we determine how it will be split.

For this, look at each group members level, and add 5 to everyones level
(your included), and now add it all up.  Call this aggregate_level.  Now
take
just your level, add 5 and divide it by aggregate_level.  This is your group
split.  Figure this for each group member, and multiply it by mob exp, and
this
is what each member gets.  Note that class plays absolutely no part in the
split.

Now, remember back to when VI said they took out class penatlies.  They
didnt really, they just negated the effect (so they are in effect not
there). The
way they accomplished this, is after your split of the exp is assigned to
you,
it is multiplied by your classes particular class exp modifier (what makes
you need more exp to level).  For the purpose of exp rewards, here are
the class modifiers

Wis casters (DRU, SHM, CLR), warrior, rogue - 1.0
Int casters(NEC, WIZ, MAG, ENC) - 1.1
Monk - 1.2
Hybrid (BST, SK, PAL, RNG, BRD) - 1.4

Now, the value you get after multiplying your split by this class mod, is
the experience that goes into your exp pool.  Again, for emphasis, at
first glance, it appears that an SK gets more exp than a druid, but what
you need to look at is Experience reward / Experience to level.  If the
SK and druid are the same level, the % of the level they gain per kill
will be equal, even though thier raw numbers are not.  This is the effect
of negating class penalties.

Now, since that is a lot of info to take in at once, lets have a
demonstration

Group of 5,

44 SK
46 druid
43 warrior
48 rogue
45 pally

they kill a lvl 50 mob in a dungeon (the ZEM 80 variety)
the mob gives 50*50*80 experience, or 200,000 exp.
They have a 5 person group, so 200,000 + 14% is 228,000 exp.

Now for the split, calculate group aggregate level (everyones levels + 5)
(44+5)+(46+5)+(43+5)+(48+5)+(45+5) =
49 + 51 + 48 + 53 + 50 = 251.

Now we calculate the individual splits
SK: (44+5)/251 = 49/251
druid: (46+5)/251 = 51/251
warrior: (43+5)/251 = 48/251
rogue: (48+5)251 = 53/251
pally: (45+5)251 = 50/251

now, multiply this split value by the exp reward to get the xp per person

SK: 44509 exp
druid: 46326 exp
warrior: 43601 exp
rogue: 48143 exp
pally:  45418 exp

notice that the split is purely a function of level, not class.

now we adjust the reward per class to compensate for the innate differences
in levelling requirements.

SK: 44509 * 1.4 =  62312 exp
druid: 46326 * 1.0 = 46326 exp
warrior: 43601 * 1.0 = 43601 exp
rogue: 48143 * 1.0 = 48143 exp
pally 45418 * 1.4 = 63585 exp

these are the rewards applied to your experience pool for the kill.

There will be some degree of error here from rounding and not using the
exact numbers VI uses (they are floating point numbers for class/race
mod, whereas i am using simple integers).  But in the wide scope of how
much exp you need at these levels, a couple points doesnt really mean
much.  I'll save calculating experience needed to level for another day.
