Yes.  It's the paladin and cleric greaves that require the Kobold head.
Allakhazam's had a typo in that it said "kobold hide" for the paladin
greaves.  This does not work.  I also tried the Kobold skull, but it would
not combine.  The Kobold skull *is* used in one of the other cleric pieces,
however.  The head would have to be a new item, added specifically for the
paladin (and "good" cleric) quest.

As far as I know, no one in the paladin community (eqtraders, Allakhazam's,
serverwide.paladins) has found the head.  My paladin sports the full set of
Sentinel armor, minus the greaves, as he prays for Quellious to provide a
Kobold head.
