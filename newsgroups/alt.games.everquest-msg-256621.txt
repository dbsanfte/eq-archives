Yeah they had to tone them down, a long time ago. Misty guards were
among the most hated NPCs in Norrath, up there with Holly and
Zarchoomi. 75% of the time they weren't at their posts when the
newbies ran monsters to them.

Contrast to the Wood Elf guards of the same period, who would happily
watch ten newbies die to an orc at a lift before waking up and killing
it.
