F> Ok, lets ask a few questions from the Enchanters point of view...Did you
F> assist one another (not at the same time, of course) only beat on one mob at
F> a time?
Of course.

F> Did you arrange who would take the bulldog role?  In this case it
F> really needed to be the SK. Did that person ask the either enchanter
F> what they would do when aggro'd?
The way we had decided was that the SK would do the pulling, and upon
returing would announce a mob in his incoming message, that mob was the
one we would first attack, leaving the other 2 mobs sitting there.  This
was understood by all.

F> If you are both beating one Mob then finding the non engaged ones doesn't

Before we would break mez, I would taunt a few times, then bash/attack.
Mobs never went to the enchanters when they did actually mez something.
As I understood it, they were supposed to be taking turns mezzing.
