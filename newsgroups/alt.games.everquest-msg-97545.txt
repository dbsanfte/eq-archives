One thing to note...  If you take the screenshots at face value, a lot of
the people stated that they felt the same way he did during the event.
Whether or not  it was true, it looked as though the people there felt he

people won't trust you.  This issue, however, would not have done much to
the rep, since it involved an issue with an unforseened effect of the
