I'd guess that only GMs can do this. I would think that a guide is not much
more than a normal character with maybe super-buffs or super-armor to make
them stronger (don't want a LV20 guide to show up to settle a dispute in a
dangerous zone and have someone train a LV50+ mob on him and kill him). I
would also guess (also going by what I've read) that a GM is able to do more
because they are within the network and have special software (I guess its a
different version of the EQ software) that only works from within their
network (to prevent distribution and use outside). This would explain some
of the following.
1) being able to see through someone's eyes. = They know your exact /loc at
all times, and just position the camera angle at that exact place, and
because they're on their network and have all data of mobs, characters, and
everything, their software just re-creates the scene the same way ours does
(its told where everything is and whats going on and it just moves the stuff
around following those commands).
2) being able to see all your chat/tells/anything. = Again, being connected
to the main network, all data can much easier be intercepted by them.
3) the act of possession = Because they are within the main network, all
they have to do is tell the server to quit responding to commands involving
movement, items, and almost anything from your computer, and to start
responding to the commands from their computer, acting as if its coming from
you.

I think the main reason, other than threat of exploitation and lack of as
much control, that GMs have to be actually at Verant HQ would be because of
the fact that they need direct access to the game's servers.  Also lag might
have a little to do with it too (would require high speed connection to be
GM?).

I'm not sure how right I am on all of this, but it does make pretty good
sense.
