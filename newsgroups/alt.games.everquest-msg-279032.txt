Actually, you did the same thing I did.  The abduction zone does not do 
what needs to be done to update the quest.  I had to zone back out and 
use the terraporter to get into the proper instance.  THERE I was able 
to clear the zone and get to the Fanatic at the bottom, get his key and 
open the chest on the platform I had to move crates to climb upon to get to.

But then, no spoiler here...<grins>
