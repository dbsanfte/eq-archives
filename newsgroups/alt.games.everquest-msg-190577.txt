As others have said, you really need to find a bank and turn some of that
small change into larger coin... you have about 16 plat of coin there, and
carrying it around as plat rather than gold/silver/copper will cut your
encumbrance enormously.

Are you sure they're players and not NPCs? I used to have trouble making
this distinction. If they're moving, they're usually a player (except for
guards and such, which you probably don't have problems distinguishing).
A guild tag also indicates a real player.

But the way to be *certain* is to target them and type "/whot". If they're
a player character, it will show you their name and either [ANONYMOUS]
or their class and level. If they're an NPC (non-player character) it
will come up empty.

(If anyone knows a more efficient way to make this distinction, I would
like to know it. I never played the tutorial, as it was broken before I
ever played the game.)
