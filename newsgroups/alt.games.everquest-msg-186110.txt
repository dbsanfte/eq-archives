You bring up a very good point. I think there is a happy medium
between the original "Vision" of EQ (which in a lot of ways was brutal
and unforgiving to the casual player.....can you say "stare at this
spell book for 35 levels"), and the "convenience to the point of
boring" that we are seeing now. 

It's funny to read the reviews of AC2, DAoC, etc, etc. In every review
I have read there is at least one "inconvenience" mentioned in EQ that
is addressed in the competing game (ie Corpse Recoveries). Not only do
they mention the difference, they tout it as an improvement. Yet time
and again these games fail to draw people away from EQ in mass
numbers. For all the "bitching" players do about the harder aspects of
EQ, they still thrive on the challenge.

A game like EQ should be challenging, and even "hard". Otherwise it
will quickly become boring.
