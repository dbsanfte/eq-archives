Even at 60+ levels I see no reason to sacrifice survivability(hps)
for a larger manapool,maybe on raids(Holding the exploding spiders
at MB event for example).
While doing the normal everyday xp grind,there really is no need for
chain casting mezzes,and even if you need to(but noone is doing Ldons
anymore and a better tactic would be to pacify instead of mezzing),
while the mob is mezzed with Bliss,you easily get nearly double the
mana back in this time.
I just checked Bliss on Allakhazam,its 300 mana and lasts 54 seconds,
an average keied Enchanter at 60+ gets 60 mana every 6 seconds while
medding or sitting on a horse.So you get a surplus from 240 mana !

So my sequence when looking for upgrades for my Enc or Cle is:

1) Focus gear
2) FT gear (at 55+)
3) Hp gear
4) Dex (for cleric)
Int,Wis or mana comes automatically.
