Ben made an observation about how the mechanics in early DAoC were 
abused in this regard. He hasn't followed up, yet, but it seems his 
limitation to 'early daoc' indicates that eventually it did sort itself 
out.

If that's the case then its reasonable to assert that the bnet crowd 
will 'grow up' reasonably quickly. (within the first year, perhaps even 
faster given that 'we' know how the problem 'should' be handled.)

I meant 'we' as in the MMORPG players from AC/EQ/etc not AGE per se. :)

I wouldn't put a lot of hope out for anything changing -that- quickly.
