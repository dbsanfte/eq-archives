Hi All;

As a 62 Cleric (and sometimes not to bright), I was shopping in the bazaar
and ran across a Conjuring Stone. It says it has Summon Corpse and was All
Classes and All Races. I thought this is way too cool so I bought it and 5
Tiny Jade Inlaid Coffins.

AFTER I bought it, then I noticed it had 1 charge (duhh).  Most likely I now
have wasted 4k plus 5 coffins of hard earned plat. Is there a way to
recharge this thing now that I'm the proud owner?? Or do I have just one
very expensive "Get out of Jail Free Card"

Thanks in advance for your help.
