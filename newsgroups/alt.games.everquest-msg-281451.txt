I found that statement profoundly interesting. Actually, the game I
want is GURPS with an EQ interface set in a fantasy medieval world, not
set in the Old West (ambitious for SJG on their GURPS MMO project, but
not what I'm looking for), and with Lizardmen. If you'll indulge my
GURPS rant here, it is, IMO, among the best RPG rule sets out there.
Even if you twink your 50-point (equivelant to a lvl 1~5 D20) character
with all kinds of magical or technical crap, at the end of the day one
good strike from a lucky Orc swordsman will smash your skull in - YOU
DIES. No levels, no godly ammounts of hitpoints; just your humble
health score of somewhere between 1 and 20 (reasonably somewhere
between 8 and 18) and your various skills.

I have a number of programs I've written that do a wonderful job of
automating many of the calculations and dice rools involved with GURPS,
but nothing with a 3D GUI. EQ (1 or 2) gives me two of the three things
I'm looking for, which isn't too bad. If I can ever get Crystal Space
or comparable 3D game engine with a decent terrain engine to compile
right on FreeBSD or Solaris, I'll see about creating the MMO I want.
Untill then, the EQ's and PlaneShift come the closest. While PlaneShift
is free to play, I prefer being able to just roll up a character, not
have to go through two days worth of screens writing a novel on my new
character's family background three generations back.

Many of my friends play WoW, and with good reason. We all loved
WarCraft, we spent most of 1996 and a goodly chunk of 1997 playing
WarCraft2, Diablo 1 was what occupied much of the following year, and
we hardly ever left our rooms with Diablo 2 - My wife and I STILL play
D2 occasionally. WoW takes the lessons learned from Diablo 1 & 2,
places them in the WarCraft universe - one rich in history and well
written mythos - and gives it that all-important 1st person
perspective. Blizzard also has an exemplary track record when it comes
to customer service and product quality - remaining bugs with Diablo 2
are pretty much non existant (Patch 11 was released, what, earlier this
year? Even after they stated patch 10 would be the last). Quite frankly
Sony has nothing on them in either CS or QA. And the writing - By
Cazic's blobby appendages, the EQ writing is bad, comically so. My sole
reason for continuing with EQ and not playing WoW really is the
presence of a playable lizardman race. As daft a reason as that may be,
there it is.
