Well from my experience I got killed by things that are Red to me.  So
I would say neither one of you will get any XP as you will both get
killed.

A Lvl one can only group with a Lvl 1 and get XP.

To get XP with a higher lvl person they can not be higher then your
LVL + half your LVL.

So a lvl 10 can group with a 15.  A lvl 20 with a 30.  A 30 with a 45.
