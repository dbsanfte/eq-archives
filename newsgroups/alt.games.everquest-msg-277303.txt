Hey, that's good news. EQ2 is a better game than WoW, lack of PvP is
it's major failing. Maybe I'll give it a try, again, whenever they get
beyond the "first step" (and the second and third :p) - or maybe
won't. I'm having trouble generating any enthusiasm for MMORPGS these
days. I'm starting to believe that EQ was just a fluke. It's good to
see EQ2 is doing something about their biggest failing, though. A game
that's short on content really cannot be without PvP to fill the gap.
