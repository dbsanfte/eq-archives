Actually, farmers pretty much work from sunrise to sunset
*anyway* (if not longer.)  And dairy cows, for one, don't
seem to like their milking time arbitrarily changed just
because some clock wants to be adjusted an hour forward
or backward.  Farmers are, in general, one of the biggest
organized groups of daylight saving time opponents.  (

Daylight Saving Time actually gives the 9-5 worker more
"quality" time off in daylight.  The time change shifts
an hour of sunlight from early morning to evening, the
normal non-working hours.  And, more important, Daylight
Saving Time saves energy by reducing lighting requirements
for that "extra" hour of daylight in the evening when most
people are at home.  (Shifting it from the early morning
hours when most people would be asleep.)
