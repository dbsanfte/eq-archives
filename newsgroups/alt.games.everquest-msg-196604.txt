Would it?  Seems to me this would be pretty tedious reading by and large, and
you'd have to know what you were looking at.

Or I could list every item with all stats.

And then you could do the math.

Or we could rely on EQ to do the math for us, Naked, Geared, all I had to do
was subtract the two to generate the third column which shows how much my gear
boosted me at that level.

In the past, for other characters, I've done the line item thing, its nice for
letting people see what I've got and suggest better items for some slots, but
thats' not really the point I was making here.

In other threads, people have called my shaman a twink, and they are certainly
correct; he's been loaded with gear he couldn't have gotten at level one on his
own, killing enough spiderlings to pay for it all would have leveled him up to
at least 5th (where I think maybe you could find some green spiderlings so you
could stop leveling)

How much of a twink, though, and how much difference it makes versus a
"straight" shaman of the same level in fighting style seems a more interesting
question, though.

I think most of the stats are very much in line with what a character my level
could expect to be using, with the exception of HP and perhaps AC, and
certainly the regen.  I think I left out regen, extra 5 hp every tic, which
seems silly but really adds up, at least so far.
