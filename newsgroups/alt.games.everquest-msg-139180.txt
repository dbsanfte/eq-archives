Not unique by any means.  I worked on a project a few years back where
C++ was abused in exactly the fashion you describe for Java.  I joined
in the middle of the project just as everything was starting to fall
apart (I had the good fortune to be assigned a sub-project that was
completely distinct from the main system).  These geniuses had taken a
bunch of skilled C programmers and given them a one-week class in OOP,
a clueless project manager, and a 23 year-old wunderkind contractor
as a project lead, with predictable results.  Actually, the best part
was that the project lead left to join a (soon-to-be) dot-bomb, but
not until after he'd saddled them with a system architecture built
around several newbie mistakes that most anybody experienced in
multi-tasking would've avoided like the plague they were.  But then,
every middle-manager knows that a kid fluent in incomprehensible jargon
is far more productive than any veteran engineer could possibly be.
