Same way any non-american with previous experience of expansions gets
them.

1: Get a friend to buy an extra copy, put the files up on FTP for you,
and PM you the activation key. Paypal him the cash, or buy a replacement
key code once they hit the stores over here.

2: Wait a month until they hit the stores over here.

According to the release schedule in Game, PoP is scheduled to hit the
stores 22nd November in the UK. Sorry, that's just far too long for me.
A month behind my guildies in terms of exp, exploration and gear, would
severely hinder my playing. I'd be L61 while there were much higher. I
wouldn't be able to tank, and would be nothing more than a manasponging
liability on raids. Therefore, I have to choose '1'
