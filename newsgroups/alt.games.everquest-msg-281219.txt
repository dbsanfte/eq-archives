In 1999 people got rich selling crafted banded armor.  To players.  Some got
poor selling crafted banded armor.  To merchants.

In 2000, same thing, different crafted items.

In 2001, same thing, different crafted items.

Etc., etc., etc.  Nothing new here.  Been this way since day one.  There
*used* to be a few items that some *minor* profit could be made from.  I
think there was a patch a year or so ago that made that impossible by game
mechanics.  It affected few items, though, because like I said...  since day
one.

It is still quite possible to make a profit from various tradeskills.  But,
since day one, the only way you're getting rich is by selling to players. 
If you miss, or misjudge, the market, you lose.
