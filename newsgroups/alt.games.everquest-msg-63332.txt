Hi,

I just wanted to say "Thank You" to both Bizbee and Steve, who emailed
the files that I was missing.  Getting those files allowed the patcher
to run, and helped me ultimately figure out why I was having problems.

So the patcher is working fine now, Thanks to You both!

As it turns out, I guess that the reason that I (and many other
people) never got the skins folder, Win32bitmap.dll, and the other
files was because we did not have Internet Explorer 5.5 installed
on the system.

From what I can tell, the new patcher MUST have Internet Explorer
5.5 on the system in order to work.  Otherwise it is unable to patch
itself, and therefore it could not download the new folder data and
the files.

After I installed Internet Explorer 5.5 and made sure my "Lan Settings"
had only "detect automatically" checked, the patch worked fine.

LOL!  Before this I only had Internet Explorer 3.02 on the system,
because I never use Internet Explorer... I always use Netscape.

I had never bothered to upgrade Internet Explorer, because I never
use it.  That will show me!!

If anyone else is having the same problems, maybe this info will
help them.

You must install Internet Explorer in order for the new patcher to
work.

Again Thanks to Bizbee and Steve for emailing the files to me which
helped me figure this out!!  Cheer!

Best Regards,

 - Mike Dorr
