False.  My int jewelry pricelist:

Piece              Gem                  Metal             My Asking Price
------------------ ------------------   ----------------  ---------------
+2 Int Ring        Star Rose (1.05pp)   Silver (5g)       5pp/pair
+2 Int Neck        Star Rose (1.05pp)   Electrum (2.7pp)  5pp
+4 Int Neck        Star Rose (1.05pp)   Gold (10.5pp)     20pp
+4 Int Ring        Star Rose (1.05pp)   Platinum (105pp)  200pp
+5 Int Ring        Star Rose (1.05pp)   Velium (262.5pp)  500pp
+4 Str +4 Int Neck Sapphire (105pp)     Silver (5g)       200pp
+4 Str +2 Int Ear  Sapphire (105pp)     Electrum (2.7pp)  200pp each
+4 Int +2 Str Ear  Sapphire (105pp)     Gold (10.5pp)     200pp each
+7 Str +7 Int Neck Sapphire (105pp)     Platinum (105pp)  400pp
+8 Str +8 Int Neck Sapphire (105pp)     Velium (262.5pp)  700pp

Note:  I've never once been asked to make a Star Rose neck.  And most, 
once they could afford the +4 or +5 Int rings, have managed to loot better 
ones.  

My prices are occasionally high by as much as 25%, since I'd really 
rather be fighting than chasing around making people jewelry, so you may 
find things a -little- bit cheaper.  But the cost of materials tends to be 
a point that jewelers are -extremely- unlikely to sell below, and there's 
no possible player-made Int ear for anywhere near 15pp.  That's why 
Cubert's such a good quest. :)  The Golden Ear Stud also drops off Gnoll 
Embalmers in LR, Ghanex Drah in SK, and Varsoon the Undying in QH.  Rare 
drop though, and possibly a bit high for you.  And it now has Extended 
Affliction I.

For your particular case, I would recomend hitting up a lowbie enchanter 
for +2 Int rings.  Many chanters in the 8-12 level range wil be more than 
happy to make these for you... That's a whole nother spell!

One thing you're probably finding if you're looking for player merchants 
is that there isn't much available you can afford at this level, even 
though websites show lots of it.  The reason for this is, once you're high 
enough level to kill the things that drop the stuff you'd like to buy, 
it's no longer worth it to the player to waste an inventory slot hauling 
around something that they can only get 5-10pp for.  So you may have to 
find out what zone it drops in, go there, and /auc onsite.
