When I found out today that it takes three frickin' AA to not EVEN match
jboots speed I was SOOO glad I stuck my first point in INT instead.

Especially considering SoW isn't supposed to stack with the AA speed
increase (according to the V screen, anyway).  Don't know if that includes
horses, though the V screen seems to say that it DOES include horses.

Three freakin' AA points to get a crap running speed increase...no thanks.
If I ever get my monk above 50 maybe I'll rethink it but that'll be a few
years. :)
