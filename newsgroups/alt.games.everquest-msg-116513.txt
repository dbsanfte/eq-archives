After reading (and remembering) about the transparent inventory screen being
only at 800x600 and above, I decided to give it a try (so I can see mobs and
stuff behind my inventory).  Well I tried and I didn't like it.  Not the
transparent part, but the size of everything at 800x600 as compared to
640x480.  I ran that resolution for about a minute or less and then went
back.  I like the inventory, but honestly I don't get any good use out of
the other parts that come along with it.
    With higher resolution you get...
1) Your video card is forced to do more work, slowing your system down.
2) Everything is smaller except the amount of space you see remains the same
(from what I tested, objects on each side of you appear in the same position
even with higher resolutions, not any closer inward from the sides of the
screen...its more like comparing TV to HDTV...exact same image, just one is
drawn in higher detail).
3) Images are smoother and less likely to see pixel effect, but if someone
doesn't like the little difference that the fonts and everything shrink up,
then they won't really notice the little difference in a few more pixels
either.

Why can't we have transparent inventory at 640x480?  Is it just impossible
for the programmers to do this?  I don't see how it would be if they can
make it happen at higher resolutions but wouldn't be able to at lower
640x480?  Why not do that, and just make it an INI file change, default is
off, but can turn it on (like the ability to log in at full screen mode, and
with RUN turned on)?  That way those of us who refuse to run 800x600 or
higher, because we sit 12-18 inches from our 19" monitor at 640x480
resolution, can have the transparent inventory screen.
