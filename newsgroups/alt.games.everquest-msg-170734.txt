I want something in between.  Sitting in one spot for an hour or two while
things are pulled gets boring fast: stand, nuke, nuke, concussion, nuke,
sit, wait for pull, repeat for two hours is not my idea of fun.  I want the
group to move through the dungeon.  However, not like the group you were in,
with everyone going their own way--it needs to be organized.
