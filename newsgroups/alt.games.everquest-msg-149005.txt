I said in another thread that I'd recount our Ragefire battle, but I can't
find it.

Background:  Social guild that can raid.  Minimum level allowed is 20,
though we have only a handful of people with mains under 50.  Average level
is around 52-53.  Approx 50 active players.

And there's not a lot to say, either.  We had 44 guild characters (35+ with
dual boxing), 15-20 of which were 55+.  We also had about a dozen friends
who wanted to help.

As most dragon killers know, 44 people is slight overkill for a public
NAGAFEN raid...it's serious overkill for a private Ragefire (someone posted
that a single, skilled, group of level 60s can taken him down) fight.  I
mean, not just overkill, but good god, serious overkill.

Soo, not much to report this time.  Buffed up as much as we could before the
cleric turned the piece in early, killed the sissyboi in his red dress
inside 30 seconds (probably fewer, I wasn't watching) and had Rage down to
about 50% before I could even get my wizard into range (died due to lack of
buffs after his first nuke), and was running shortly thereafter...fight
lasted about a minute, I think.  The cleric, two bards (scales) and a monk
(bag) are happy.

We're doing Chardok this weekend...we're hoping to do Ragefire next week if
we're lucky enough to get SolB done (the new bottleneck).  Likely the best
we'll muster up is 24 and that'll be a much better indicator of how good we
are.
