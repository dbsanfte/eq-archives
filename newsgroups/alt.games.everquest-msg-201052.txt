As a low level druid who seldom gets a cut of any of the Uber Loot I'd
like to ask you how should I go about trying to raise the cash for my
next level spells? Surely you don;t think I can get it by teaming up
and healing the hell out of a bunch of tanks who grab all the loot
before anybody else can get to a corpse! Maybe you thinkI can earn
enough soloing in PC...... where the campers outnumber the spawn!!

So Mr. Benevolent, how should I earn my spell money?
