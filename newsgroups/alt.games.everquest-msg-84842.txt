> Wow.. that is interesting. So they hired away a gemstone guy

  Gal, actually. ;)  "Varevice", she was our "god guru" (GS3 has GM
"gurus" and liasons for different aspects of the game--gurus for each
of the professions, the combat system, creatures, towns and also
elements of lore, like the gods.)  I'm not sure what she's doing for
Verant or if she's involved with EQ Legends, but it wouldn't surprise
me too much if she was.

  I might be tempted myself, except as long as I play EQ, I'm going to
be playing [mainly] on FV.  No way I'm spending $30 extra a month to
attend events on another server.  If they held "ticketed"
quests/events of any quality (like Simu does) on my main server, I
might consider paying to participate in some of them.

  Some people are turned off from the idea of ticketed quests,
exclusive servers and differing levels of service, but if it's the
only way the new content is going to make it in to the game, I don't
really see a problem.  The idea of giving players an advantage/bonus
for paying extra RL money originally was repellant to me (and still
is), but in the case of Simu I think they did a pretty good job of
strictly limiting just how much gameplay benefit you get from
elevating your level of service through pay... though they crossed the
line a couple times, in my opinion, generally they have kept it under
control so you are paying more for the enjoyment of the unique event,
rather for the "lewts".
