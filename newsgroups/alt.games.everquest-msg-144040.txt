Yes, but inextricably intertwined with it. You
don't get one without the other.

This is the meaning of intent, paraphrased from
YourDictionary.com;
The design or purpose to commit a wrongful or
criminal act and/or the state of mind with which
an act is done.

No it isn't. Hatred has to be proven against a
group, not an individual.

Why not?

Why not?

You are right. 

Killing Jews used to be popular, now they punish
you for it.

I don't think there is, is there?
