I think they should change the name on the Mac version as it is clearly NOT
Everquest the way we know it. I have played the Mac version on a buddies Mac
and it is identical to our version "PC" but Sony refuses to intermingle the
two versions. I have noticed that "Mac People" are much nicer and more
courteous. I feel sorry for the poor slob who goes out and buys the Mac
version to play with his buddies who are on "X" server and finds that he can
not play with them. Hence the desire to get them to change the name, like
they did with EQOA.
