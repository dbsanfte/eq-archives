Concession?  I think you need to stop trying to use long words when you
obviously dont know what the hell they mean.

No, I concede no points, I just believe you are trying to justify the
cheating because you do / did it yourself.  Which may or may not be true, I
dont know, and I dont care.

But, you are still an idiot.

Anything you get through cheating is worth fuck all, and make things that
people actually gain, without cheating, worth less.
