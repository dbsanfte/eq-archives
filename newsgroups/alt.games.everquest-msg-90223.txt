Ayup, for Tunare worshippers only, 55+ clerics. Can't remember
stats or name offhand, but if you search Allakhazam's quest
database for 'Idol of Disease', 'Idol of Corruption', and two
other idols, you'll find it. Don't most Tunare-worshipping
classes get PoG quests? I know clerics, druids and rangers do,
at least...

Anyway, this pisses the non-Tunare folks in my guild off, cause
me and a couple other clerics won't go to PoG because of it[1],
and apparantly they can't convince the 20-something Brell- or
Innoruuk-worshipping clerics to go there, go figure.

[1] Not to mention the RP considerations of killing your own
good-aligned god...[2]

[2] Lots of CT- and Inny-worshippers will now point out that I
expect them to go kill their gods. Not true, however, I don't
think they'd expect anything less from their followers...
