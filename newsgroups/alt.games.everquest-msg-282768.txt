I did the EQ2 and WoW thing all last year and I've found out that none
of this new stuff can beat the real challenge of EQ or the fun of a 72
person EQ raid or zone progression after reaching max level.  I'm not
sure a person starting a brand new character would enjoy the game, but
I like it a lot better than the new stuff since I've had an account
since 1999.

Hopefully, Vanguard Saga of Heroes will shape into a fun MMORPG that
will be popular for years.
