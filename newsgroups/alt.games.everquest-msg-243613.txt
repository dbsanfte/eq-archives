Ah, yes. Good times. It's been more than four years, but I still clearly 
remember my first runins with that Griffin. They were many, and often 
short but incredibly painful. I recall advertising (begging, really) in 
OOC for one of the unbelievably uber characters who were auctioning 
merchandise at the tunnel to please come kill it so we could get on with 
our orc camping.

I still kill that feathered bastard any time I happen to see him when I 
pass through the commons. It's not as fun now that I have several nukes 
that will one shot him. But I still do it anyway, and can't resist a 
small smile and a thought of, "Hey, Birdbrain. Remember me? I'm 
baaaaaaaack."
