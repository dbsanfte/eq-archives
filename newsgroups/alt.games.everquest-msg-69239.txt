This is true and not true.  Summon Warder is indeed an ability... but
what it summons is a level 5 pet.  You need to cast an actual spell
to buff it up to useful level, and this and all other buffs wear off when
the pet zones.  Other than as a parlor trick, the fact that the pet
can zone with you is really not important, it saves you the 10 seconds
or so it would take to make a new one.  Summon uses no mana and
no components, so "zoning" really doesn't save you anything else.

Pet damage is comperable to that of mage and necro pets of the same
level... except that you can't give them weapons, so at low levels they
really lag far behind (8 damage instead of the 20 any mage/necro pet
with 5 gp to spare for a rusty halberd can have)

I"m too low level to have access to any of the cool buffs, but they
look like the real edge for the beastlord pet; many and varied, looks
like they will make the pet more dialable and tuneable than mage
pets...a guildmate with a 38 Beastlord reports that they proc like
mad with dex buff from a shaman.

I find the class very enjoyable, although I'm still looking for the "killer
app."  I think I may have found one of the tactical tools I was looking
for, as any "not really armored" tank class will tell you, being able
to lose aggro on demand is crucial.  Well, an old friend (my cleric
had it memmed 24/7 from 1 to 44) is in the spell list for the level
9 beastlord, Flash of Light.  Need to get divination up a bit for this,
but when it went off I was able to back out of combat, heal up, and
come back in like a dream.  It isn't an anti-taunt, which would be
better, but it is at least a "get it off me" that will allow anyone who
doesn't want to be sponge to back out.

They have ultravision, like a DE, Safe fall and Sneak at 50 naturally.
Classes available are beastlord, warrior, rogue, shaman and bard.
19 out of 20 will be beastlords, which I think is natural for the same
reason I'm playing one... I"ve -played- the other classes before,
and I've played the other races before.  Vah Shir Beastlord lets
me play both a new class and a new race at the same time.

Thus far the area around Shar Val is the best newbie area in the
game, loaded with quests, challenging prey to solo or group, pretty
visually.

If you can get in a group with a warrior, rogue, shaman, bard, and
two beastlords you'll really rock out, that is a heck of an array
for a single race to have available.  Alternately, 5 beastlords with
either a warrior or rogue to pull also works very well, thats 11
tanks tearing large chunks out of the prey, with a bow puller...
warrior probably better since he can also main tank, although
main tanking is overrated in a group like this, since the more efficient
heal, Inner Fire, has stacking issues, and soon enough our pet heal
is going to be more HP to Mana efficient than IF anyway.  Spreading
damage among the pets is going to be the ideal if we can figure
out how to arrange it.
