Ok, so they want 8,000 people in the server (number sony posted), and they
are making $30 each for the extra content. 30x8,000 = $240,000 a month extra
or 2.88 Million dollars a year... This is above and beyond the "normal"
fees.

Is there really going to be almost 3 million dollars worth of new content on
this server?
