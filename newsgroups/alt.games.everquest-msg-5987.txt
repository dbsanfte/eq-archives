Yes, that's why I got it, as at the time I did, my main was around lvl 17 or
18, so it didn't buy me anything else.  Although my low teens druid is busy
wandering around Velious looking at the sights, staying far away from
anything that cons something other than indifferent with Camo on.  So far so
good, no deaths yet, good thing, it's a long ride from Freeport.  At least
when my shammy is ready for it, I will have some idea of what some of the
zones look like.
