My Iksar Monk has reached level 30 and I'm wondering where to hunt now.  I
have done very little faction work except to be able to sell in the bazaar
and Shadow Haven.  I have considered SolA, Frontier Mountains, and Kaesora
(which I doubt I'll be able to find a group in).  I'm looking for somewhere
that has good experience (nothing amazing like Paludal expected, just a
decent movement of the bar) and good loot specifically in plat or jewels or
anything lightweight that I can carry and sell later (preferably to
vendors).  Also somewhere I can bind relatively close to, not have to walk
across the world to bank and vendor, and somewhere that sneaking in isn't an
issue (like High Keep).  I know that is all a lot to ask for, but I thought
I'd ask, just to see whatever input you may have.  Thank you ahead of time.
