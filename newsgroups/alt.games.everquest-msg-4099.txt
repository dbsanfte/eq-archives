8 hours! 8 hour camps are for wusses!

Seriously, a lot of items take longer than that, either due to spawn times
or rareness of the drop. If you have a MoB that spawns every 5 hours, and a
10% chance of him dropping some UBER item, you could very well end up
waiting 50 or more hours to get what you're after. My husband and I did one
camp in shifts. Two computers in the same room, and a free weekend. We put
both characters on the spawn point, and took turns watching. At spawn time,
we'd wake up, or turn off the TV, or Diablo II, or whatever, and kill the
guy, then we'd loot him, and when he didn't have what we were waiting for,
go back to real life. It was pretty boring, but that's not all EQ is. I've
only had to do that once in 32 levels, so it's not that bad.
