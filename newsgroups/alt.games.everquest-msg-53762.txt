Weeeeeeeeelllllllll..... not as much spirit as you might think. The
first time I ran up the hill upon arriving at the island to "scope
things out" and see if he was still up. (Orlun got there first and saw
him, but we were wondering if he despawned or something, not seeing
him.) He crested the ridge same time I did and aggro'd on me before
either of us had symbol on us, and Tiru was only at about 3/4 mana.
After I died, we though perhaps full mana and symbol might turn the
scales (pun intended) in our favor. The results speak to our lack of
prediction abilities.
