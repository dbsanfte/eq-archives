Sure, the MoSS is that way.  But they also gave the SK an SBS, while
they gave the Paladin a Cracked Darkwood Shield.  That's just plain
pathetic.  And MoSS or no MoSS, why give the Paladin a de-fanged
Ghoulbane instead of, say, a Centi SS which would be a much better
weapon for him (hell that Centi Warspear would be much better, and
you can find them for 10pp on mature servers).

Paladin also got the Banded Cloak, which made the mind-boggling Serp
Bracers even more stupid as Banded would have been far more useful.
And then there's giving the Paladin a crap bow instead of, oh let's
say the Goranga Idol they gave the Bard.

I think you're right about that, tho it's still stupid to give a
character with zero money a bow and no arrows.

Oh, and I know I snipped your "except for the Paladin" comment above,
didn't want to let it spoil an opportunity to get in a few more quick
ranting digs at that silly kit.  :-p
