   Dunno about the Zeks, but I just tried to access the Bristlebane and
Solusek Ro message boards to see what sort of reaction they were getting
since the news of the new server merger has broken.  I think the SR
board link is to a guild forum maybe, or maybe that server was so light
that their message forum gets squat in traffic.  The one for Bristlebane
is just plain broken, however.

   I visited every server forum when I originally complied the list, but
that was well over a year ago.  Some do tend to wander, so there are
probably a few broken links by now.
