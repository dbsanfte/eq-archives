Getting first agro is impossible to call.. when 2 or more guilds are sat at
the spawn spot, both are going to engage/make sure they get "hit first"

It becomes a ks fest, or you guys have zero chance of getting that cleric
epic, pure and simple sadly.

Of course you have the option of rolling on it...

haha...  of the 3 guilds that squared upto each other for rage at the
weekend... none of them got him in the end.

Theres quite a lot of controversy though... GM's have adopted the same
general stance.. "whichever group gets the exp, their guild gets the epic"..

Well when he was killed the guild whos group got exp looted it.. only for
the GM to force a DESTROYING of it, and award it to the other guilds cleric.

Will be interesting to hear why this particular GM lied (if he said
"whoevergets exp..."), or went against the standard GM response in doing
this..
