I talked with one of the tinkers in our guild.

I think he said that the materials required to create it run around 900 pp.
Trivials somewhere around 170 or 200?  and Tinkering is *not* a cheap trade
skill to raise.

So... selling for 1500 pp is possible, if they're high enough.  But they have
to ignore the possibility of recovering any part of thier training cost.
Getting them cheaper than that would probably require the tinker to not take
into account the failure rate, as well as ignoring his training costs.
