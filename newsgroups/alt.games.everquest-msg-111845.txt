   Ah yes.  All of my characters have made the trip up there
to get these.  They are cheap enough that its painless if I
have to burn one to make room for a spit or sewing kit or
something.  Of course, they are mis-named.  At 25 stone
each, they really ought to be called "Bank-Bags".  The only
other PITA thing about them is that they are no-drop.  Still
well worth a bank-stocking trip through the spires, though.
   I wonder if these have had an impact on the price of
tailored backpacks.  For months, for the whole year or
thereabouts that I've been playing, these sold steadily on
Drinal for 100p.  In the last couple of months, I've seen
the /auction WTS price go from 90p, to 80p, to finally 50p
(seen a couple of times last week).

all large sewing kits into Deluxes again.
