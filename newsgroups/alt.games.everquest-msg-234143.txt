I know a monk who tends to have his moments like your puller.  For him, it's
about the excitement of dealing with a bunch of mobs at once, pacify is for
sissies, and, of course, if things go too far south he can always FD.
Sometimes he pulls and sometimes he just engages the mobs where they are,
maybe you'll get an "incoming" or "come to me" message, but probably not.
The first time I grouped with the guy, I thought, "Never again", but now
it's just a fun experience.  Heaven help the pickup groups that he joins
that has no idea of what to expect, though.
