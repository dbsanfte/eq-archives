It's not paranoia.  It's common sense.  They monk nerf was announced in
preparation for PoP, the expansion that raised the level limit to 65, and
we've just been shown that they only data they bothered to gather was
limited to level 60 (or that they are willing to admit they gathered,
depending on how paranoid you want to be, which doesn't matter to me as
"evil" or "stupid" really don't make much difference to me as an end user
seeing the results).

I comprehended his post just fine.  I was disgusted, even assuming
everything is "up and up", at their complete and total lack of foresight and
utter ineptness in conception and implementation of the nerf.

If you would care to argue on the side of paranoia, feel free.  My opinion
is that they were idiots, you can assume evil if you wish.
