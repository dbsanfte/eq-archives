*scoff* - Thats ridiculous on its face. If your going to lie to try and
bolster your own image at least try to make the lies sound plausible.

Bullshit. Your still free to interact with anyone else you can find on the
internet. You are however NOT free to try and force someone to allow you on
to thier servers w/o paying for that access. Using your logic I should be
forced to open up my own private FTP service to the whole world just because
I use the internet as my communications medium. Furthermore your telephone
anaology is completely incorrect. Sure, by paying the basic monthly charges
you are granted access to the telephone network. However you still have to
pay extra for other related services such as Voice-Mail, Caller ID, and
other premium add on services. Using your logic all those services should be
free for the taking.
