From the rather exhaustive parses some fella did on Steelwarriors AC doesn't
affect much if you get hit or not but does affect how much you do get hit
for, i.e. mitigation.  Avoidance, which is kinda balled up into the AC
number is some weird manner is what causes one to get missed.

Pretty much correct for your typical PoP xp critters. Again, the Steelwarriors
parses do show an affect at AC1700-1800.  Not that typical mortals will
ever get to that point. :)
