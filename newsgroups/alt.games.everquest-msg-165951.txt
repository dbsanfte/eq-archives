Sony's naming policy cuts out names that should be allowed and leaves the
stupid ones... like, for example, I tried to make a character named
Dinrandir (I used that name on another RPG I used to play), which means
Silent Wanderer in Tolkien's Sindarin language... I'm assuming that this is
illegal b/c it's based on Tolkien, but honestly, I can't see why that name
is bad and Dudad is just fine...
I think Sony maybe should take another look at their name filters one of
these days, there are a lot of really dumb names out there.
