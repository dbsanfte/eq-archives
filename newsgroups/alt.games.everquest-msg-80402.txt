Sure this could be done, but it wouldn't work how you think. All you'd need 
to do would be unplug your modem or ethernet card instead of typing /quit. 
Same result as actually going LD, because you'd be forcing your connection 
to go LD. EQ wouldn't be able to tell the difference because there'd be 
none. That's why they don't do this.
