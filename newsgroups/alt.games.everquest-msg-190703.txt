Last night I was looking for poachers in SFG with a 9th level alt and had
the Bloodsaber Defiler arrgo on me. She DoTed the heck outta me and feared
me. Here is the weird thing. I was the only one in the zone and every time
my hp dropped to under 20 I would get fully healed. I was finally able to
zone after being feared 4 times and fully healed 5 times. Was one of the SFG
Mobs healing me. I have never had an NPC heal me on a whim before. This was
on the new Starfyre server.

Thanks
