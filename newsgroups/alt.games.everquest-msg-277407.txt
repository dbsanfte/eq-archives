If you don't, get a partner who can, from what i have seen that's not too
hard. I think all melee types do and i presume other classes have something,
although my experience is limited. 500 sound slike a lot, but when they are
level 9 gnolls and yopu can get the max number engaged, they go fast,
especially if you have a partner. The named seem to be weaker now than they
used to be, and i found the toughest bit was the beginning and the end, the
beggining (nek run) being very scary.
