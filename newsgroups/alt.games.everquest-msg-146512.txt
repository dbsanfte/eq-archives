He's a lazy-assed dipshit swatting zero risk mobs for their unusually
good cash-loot drops.  As bizbee said, the OP should have /reported
the idiot's "I'm camping the zone" line, but instead of petitioning
immediately he should have waited for the first KS or attempted train,
and then petitioned him.  He should also have passed all this on to
his friends and guildmates, and checked the moron for guildstatus
and tried to contact an officer of his guild.  Not all morons are in
guilds led by morons, sometimes they manage to get into decent guilds
which are usually very happy to learn the guy's an ass so they can
boot him before he does serious damage to the guild's reputation.
