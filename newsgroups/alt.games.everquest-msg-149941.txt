Actually, if you want to be "logical" about it...  It'd be one whole
helluvalot more "realistic" if negative faction hits included a
proportional _permanent_ reduction in your cap for that faction
(maybe only a chance of a chance of a cap reduction for small hits).
I find it utterly absurd that you can spend an extended period of
time slaughtering Giants for CoV faction, and then turn around and
trash CoV faction getting Giant faction up to "max ally".  Or go
kill a few WW dragons with big faction hits, and then fix it by
going to Kael.  Or ...
