This is how I see it...
after you hit 200+wis then every point of wis will equal 6mana.. so
1wis=6mana
(i could be a point or 2 off.. never really found out exactly.. but I think
6 when I look for gear)

Current Item
Black Alloy Medallion
6AC 5 WIS Mana Preservation II
so if 5wis=30mana
now the smoothmetal torque is same wis but you gain 45 mana and cold and
fire resists.. which will be useful when you go dragon hunting in TOV...



Just bought (800pp):
Large Smoothmetal Torque
6AC 5 WIS 25 HP 45 Mana 5 SvFire 5 SvCold
Recommended Level 50

Hope that helped=)  (plus I think the mana preservation might come a bit
obsolete after 50.. don't quote me on this though.. when I gave up my
medallion I didn't miss it much=)
