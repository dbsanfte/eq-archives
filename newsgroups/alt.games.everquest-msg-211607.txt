We actually have it better than warriors in a way -
The malo line is very low aggro.  At level 51 I'd
pull the entrance of the Hole with Malosi and get
singles every time.  A 51 warrior tried to do the
same thing, from the same spot with a bow and got
3.

At level 65 this is especially true - go look in the
bazaar for IDIV items.  I couldn't even find one today.

You don't get stat boosts from the coldstone if it's in your
ammo slot.  This is supposedly the reason the Shard of the
Core is a range slot item - because otherwise you wouldn't
get the resists.  Apparently the LDoN spell Orb of Exploration
is a range slot item with +20 to a couple resists and plainsight
on it.  We're already going nuts trying to get it ammos slot
equippable - we'll happily give up those resists to get plainsight
in the ammo slot.

Lev rings and waterstones -
advantages: No components, insta cast
dis-advantages - need think ahead and have them available

Not a bad trade off.

I was never a huge fan of our heals - 1:2 mana to health ratio
with enormous recast delays.  Even the very rare level 60 pet
heal had a crappy ratio.  Planar renewal is the first really good
pet heal (300 mana/1200 heal)  Prior to level 50, in almost all
cases you are better off just nuking the mob down.  At 44 camping
Gornit, I found that I was able to actually be ready at his
pop by not healing and balancing nukes against pet health (I wanted
the pet health high enough so gornit would run, but low enough
so I could avoid an extra nuke).  The only exception was the cyclops
spawns at the AC camp in OOT.  They had so many HP I found it more
effective to use a fire pet and use the level 8 and 20 heals to
chain heal (some close fights).  This was previous to the 2 40's
heals introduced in PoP and LoY of course.

If we could slow as much as 40% at 65 we'd be overpowered
I think.  As it is, using my 52 'bot 'chanter to slow
(shiftless deeds) I can easily take 56+ mobs in CT.  The
enchanter only slows in those instances.  (well, and provides
C2)

I could really care less about soloing in PoP.  I don't like
soloing, and I'd much rather be in a group.  Even as a non-
raiding mage I find that I'd rather have a way of dumping aggro
over just about anything else.
