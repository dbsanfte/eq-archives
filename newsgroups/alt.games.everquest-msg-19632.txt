Certain levels take twice the normal amount of experience to complete. It's 
apparently the result of some poor programming, from what I've read along 
the 
way. The hell levels are 30, 35, 40, and 45 for sure. I've also heard that 
pretty much every level from 50 - 59 is a hell level.

The key to getting through these levels with your sanity intact seems to be 
either (1) efficient soloing, (2) get in a good group in a constant pull 
area 
like the ledge in OT or Dreadlands even or (3)grouping in a dungeon with a 
good exp bonus.

I'm gonna hit 45 tonight.. I'm hoping to get through it "quickly" by 
grouping 
in DL and in City of Mist.

<fingers crossed>
