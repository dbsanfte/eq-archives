Does anyone know at what level the "Water Sprinkler of the Forgiven",
clerical 2hb weapon will proc atone?  Or is it simply a right click effect?

I know atone is a 34 level spell, so I'm guessing it won't work until
then, but by then he won't need it.

Just got one for my son's lev 20 cleric.  

Thanks!
