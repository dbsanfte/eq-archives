MOB is short for mobile and relates to any NPC roaming the land.

XP grinding is where you group and fight in a place for a few hours for the
sole purpose of gaining exp. Not to gain loot or defeat a boss mob.

No you can't have free stuff as such but the stuff in Bazaar is so cheap
these days it won't be too much effort to get yourself kitted out decently
for very little cost.
