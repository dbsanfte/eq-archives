Yes

EQW handles memory with two instances better though, while Two regular
everquest actually CONSERVES memory.  This is weird. Like two EQW
instances of two different accounts, grouping together, might use 650
meg of 768 total ram on my computer with a very small amount of page
file usage. Two instances of regular windowed EQ, grouped, use like
250 meg of 768 system ram while using 450 or so of the page file. As
you might guess, that is a waste of having 768 meg of ram.
