Besides the datarate.txt file mentioned above, there is a Windows
built-in setting (TCP Receive Window I believe) that defines the
amount of packets that can be received in one "burst" without needing
an acknoledgement. It is set by default for a stupidly low connection,
and if you have anything above a 28k modem, you should look into it.
This is into the Registry, but you will find VBS scripts all around
the net that will adjust the TCP Receive Window for you. Just make
sure you peek at the code before running it :)
