Of course, if there weren't camp checks every thirty seconds, it would
be easier to type things out. Or, if people could wait for you to
finish a fight:

Typical scene in Plane of Valor:
Somebody says out of character, CAMP CHECK
Somebodyelse says out of character, castle wall
Somebody says (15 seconds after initial camp check) out of character,
claiming caves
six million people shout, CAVES CAMPED. We were fighting, dammit.
