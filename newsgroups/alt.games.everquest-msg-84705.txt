  I play a game called GemStone III (http://www.gemstone.net) which is
basically a pay-to-play MUD, which a while back rolled out something
similar to this called GemStone III Platinum.  Now, understand that up
to this point, there was only one GS3 server, since there were only
500-2500 players online at a time... more servers weren't necessary.
However, for $80/month (that's right, $80) you could play on GS3
Platinum, which features more GM events (merchants, quests, historical
events, invasions, ect.) and a smaller population that was supposed to
be more conducive to roleplaying... also, people playing on Platinum
would get to preview certain new features.

  Even at $80/month, GS3 Platinum was pretty successful, though
recently they lowered the price to $40/month.

  I don't know if this idea is going to fly as well with EQ.  There
are multiple servers already.  There's already a low-population server
that's supposed to be (and is) more roleplay friendly, so it seems to
me what you're paying for here is the web based character journal (big
deal, spoiler sites already have this feature, even if it isn't as
tightly integrated with the game), perhaps a better shot at getting
your petitions answered more promptly, and a better shot at
participating in GM events, plus the "preview" aspect of it.  I'd
rather wait until a feature has been tested by the folks on the Test
server and Legends server before it arrives on my server, there's a
better chance of the feature or item working properly then.

  So the only real feature here that really seems that exciting is a
better shot at participating in historical events... which is pretty
nice, but I don't know if I'd fork down cash for that unless the
events were VERY frequent, on the order of at least a couple events
per week.

  I have a feeling that somebody at Verant took a good look at some of
the features Simutronics has been featuring and are now trying to
adapt them to EQ.  I know that recently they hired away one of GS3's
senior GMs, so this wouldn't surprise me.  The exclusive "pay extra"
server, the Calender of Events, and the promise of a better chance of
participating in "special" events are all features that Simutronics
has been featuring on their games successfully for a year now.  Pretty
interesting.
