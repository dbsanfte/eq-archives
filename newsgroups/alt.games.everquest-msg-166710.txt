}Knowing where you're going is simple enough with just one locate

}Ah well, if it works it wouldn't be the first trick I'm too stubborn

In a twisty dungeon, sometimes it would be a very different route to get 
somewhere 600 units north by northwest rather than 550.  It's a handy 
trick, but I don't think I've needed it more than once in the last two 
years...
