Heh, glad this one was followed up to today. :)

I was at a party earlier this evening and heard uttered a very similar 
statement, except in that it involved a university, and anal fisting with 
no lubrication.

But then, the person speaking is pursuing a graduate degree in performance 
art, so perhaps her speech shouldn't be considered typical.  Or perhaps it 
should.  Who knows? :)
