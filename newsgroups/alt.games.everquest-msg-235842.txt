LEvels 2-18ish in Blackburrow.
LEvels 25-34 South Karanas, and a little further in Split Paw.
Levels 32-40 on the undead gnolls in the Twoer of Frozen Shadow, 
drovlargs in OverThere.
Not sure of the level for Dreadlands or Karnors.
Jagged Pine gnolls are great from 55-60.

I dont know of any gnolls post 60. I did kill some gnolls at 61 in 
Jagged Pine, but I was hitting the odd greenie.
