Minor question.  One of the merchants in the cave in EC sells Aloe Swatches
which are basically bandages.  They cost a good bit more than regular
bandages (I tested this by selling one of my regular bandages back to him
and checking the price on both, so it isn't a faction/charisma thing).  I'm
wondering, do they BW better?  Is there some innate bonus in them?  I
thought about testing it myself, but lately every time I have Bound Wound it
has been in an emergency situation (I group a lot, so emergency=cleric dead)
so I haven't really thought to pay attention to it.  Is there a website that
lists simple equipment like that and whatever advantages one may have over
the other besides the obvious (size of packs, etc)?  Thanks for any help.
