I have been using alt+enter then Alt+Tab to use the web when running
EQ since it was introduced. Recently though it sometimes reboots the
PC when I do this. Has anyone else had the same problem or got any
suggestions as to how I may fix it?

System:

Win 2000 os
572Mb ram
Geoforce MX 400 64 Mb graphix card
SB 5.1 Live sound

DSL connection and EQ with all current expansions.

Thanks - Zilva
