If your alt was level 10 or lower, he's probably gone.  There was one
time a while back when (after some advance notice) they deleted all
low-level characters who had not been played within six months.

If your character was higher-level, he should still be around, though
he may have an extra "x" on his name due to name conflicts when pairs
of servers got merged.
