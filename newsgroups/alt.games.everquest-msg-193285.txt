I would do the Cleric/Mage combo.  Here is why.  The Mage can summon Focus
Items for both himself and the cleric and also for his pet.  The mage has a
decent fire shield for the cleric.  The group could be mana efficient
because since the Mage will have a Healer as a partner, he could actually
tank a bit for his pet.

So here is how I would do it.  Cleric is responsible for healing mage and
Rooting target.  Mage gives everyone including pet focus items.  You can
give a pet two of the same type of focus items since NPCs are not affected
by LORE Items and can carry as many as the number of open inventory slots
they have.  Like two rings, two earrings, two wrist items.  LOAD the pet up
with focus items.  Mage will use Fire pet.  Celric can also buff pet with
whatever will stack with the Mage's buffs.  During fight, mob gets rooted by
cleric, fire pet attacks and Mage does enough tanking so that mod ignores fi
re pet.  Atleast as much as is possible.  Cleric heals Mage, and when mob
gets low enough, Mage takes it out with big nuke.  Cleric's main role in the
fight is to keep the Mage's health up and to root any additional mobs that
get pissed off because they see their friends getting smacked.
