Yes, yes, let's hear the tired old argument that everyone is a whiner if
they have concerns about the product they are paying for.

Perhaps my view point comes from working in the real world. Patches in
real-world networks "usually" go smooth and by the numbers. Why? Because 15
hours downtime (like yesterday) isn't tolerated in the real business world.
Changes are tested for a reasonable period of time before they are brought
live and the unexpected problems are ferreted out. It is true that not all
upgrades or patches go smooth in the business world but I've yet to see one
that results in 24 hours downtime (or even half that), which is what Verant
is about up to in the last 2 days.

I know everyone says shit happens and get over it. Well I'm not upset. I'm
posting out of boredom. I think if I really was upset and looking for
sympathy an internet newsgroup would be the last place I would post.
