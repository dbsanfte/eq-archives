No, chance of the first 10 being all heads would be .5^10.
After that it starts to get more complicated.  I don't have the formulas 
handy, I'm sure there is one somewhere.  Given lots of time, I could 
manually crank it out, but, I'm way too lazy for that.

Here are a few of the terms to be added

chances of HHHHHHHHHH are .5^10
chances of THHHHHHHHHH are  .5^11
XTHHHHHHHHHH .5^11
XXTHHHHHHHHHH .5^11
XXXTHHHHHHHHHH .5^11
XXXXTHHHHHHHHHH .5^11
XXXXXTHHHHHHHHHH .5^11
XXXXXXTHHHHHHHHHH .5^11
XXXXXXXTHHHHHHHHHH .5^11
XXXXXXXXTHHHHHHHHHH .5^11
XXXXXXXXXTHHHHHHHHHH .5^11

Next one has to be not ten heads in the first 10 attempts, followed by 
THHHHHHHHHH, so, .5^11x(1-.5^10), next would be .5^11x(1-(.5^10+.5^11))

I'll leave the rest as an exercise to the students.  :b

I did a quick google search, and did not find anything promising as far 
as a formula, I'm sure if I could remember 20 to 30 years back to high 
school and college statistics I might know what it's called and be able 
to search from there.
