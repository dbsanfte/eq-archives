Is it instant cast?  If so, that's why it is so valuable.  At higher levels,
it is common to fight mobs that like to dispell your buffs, usually starting
with your first buff.  So, what you do is first buff with buffs you don't
care about (see invis, resists that don't matter, infravision or ultravision
even if you have those racially, etc).  That way, when the mob dispells, it
just dispells one of the buffs you don't care about.

Now throw in right click instant cast buff.  As soon as you get dispelled,
you use your right click item to replace it.  If you can manage to click
faster than the mob is dispelling, you can protect your important buffs.
