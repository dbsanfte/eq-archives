Such a refreshing difference... On the flipside, I had to finally ignore
a lowbie Iksar Monk in LOIO, who for hours and hours /shouted asking for
a port to WC. When he finally got an offer to be ported from the
Windmill, he started /shouting about needing someone to take him from
Cabilis to the mill.
