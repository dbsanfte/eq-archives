For an experienced player it's a Bard.  You get a new song every level. 
By lv 20 you are probably going to be burned out or have carpal tunnel
syndrome.

Yes it isn't fun to play anything twinked at the low levels.  Maybe
warrior or monk if you have 100k of twink gear.

200pp play a caster, you can go get kei's and blow shit up.

2k?  Not really much you can do with that.
