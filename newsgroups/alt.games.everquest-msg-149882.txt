Skillup is based on highest of wis or int.  Since it's likely your wis
is higher than your int your wis would be used.  But it has nothing to
do with you being a wis caster per se.  I am not certain of this, but
I think that for fletching dex will substitute for wis/int if it is
higher than either (like str is supposed to for smithing).
