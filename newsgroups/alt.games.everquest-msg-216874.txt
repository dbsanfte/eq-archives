It happens.  I remember dying in PoG way back when because even though I was
facing entirely away from the tree I managed to zone in when I tried to
click on somebody even farther away from the tree.  There's also a couple
LDoN entrances that you can hit by accident if you set the blue line on your
compass and autorun over it (and the one in Oasis is damn hard to spot the
first time you get assigned it to boot).

"To my mind the cleric simply isn't 'good to go' unless he/she is FM."

It must be interesting to play with such fear...

Would you care to explain how you don't see the difference?  If I go in
after 5 minutes and you go in after 29, the difference is 24 minutes.

Even if you keep up with me in the dungeon (and "the cleric simply isn't
'good to go' unless he/she is FM" implies that will be an unlikely if)
you're *still* going to start the next dungeon 24 minutes after I do.
