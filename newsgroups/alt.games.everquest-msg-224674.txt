Here you go:

"First, I'd like to thank everyone that sent in information about their
collection missions. We've used that information along with a lot of
information generated from the servers to come up with a plan to get folks
to do collection missions.

"In fact, that change was already made. Given a chance to play with the
modified collection missions, many of you have noticed that they are better.
That was the best indication that we could hope for, that you'd notice they
were fixed just by doing them.

"So if you've been avoiding collection missions, give them a try. They
should now provide similar challenge to any other mission type.
