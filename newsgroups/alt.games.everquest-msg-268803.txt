I agree with pretty much everything you said, I think the only reason SOE
has set it up the way it is was with one thing in mind, trying to keep them
coming back for more, you don't reward a guild player with status and bonus
only to remove them later through decay because they choose to do something
else.

I think your right about EQ1 being better, it is except it's outdated, I
would have liked EQ2 more if they had kept it like EQ1 and just done the
graphic's upgrade with new worlds, mobs, items and houses to build on and
display your achivements.

After playing EQ1 for over 4 yrs. I can safely say I know EQ2 will never
hold my attention that long, too many things are just not right, it doesn't
grab me the same way, in fact I've played better console RPG games lately
that have more grab.

You want to know what I hate the most about EQ2 now, having to pay rent,
having to pay for a game service I get little or no service from especially
support when I have a beef with something that is not working, the responce
time is disastorious, the words they use to tell you are chosen right out of
the EQ1 guide handbook for newbie guide's.

I really was hoping for something much more special experience wise, I would
have thought they actually learned something from years of running EQ1, but
in reality it's the same thing all over again with a new set of rules,
pretty graphic's and very little concern if the game actually makes their
customers happy.

If you haven't quit or deleted your EQ1 accounts, don't, keep playing till
something better comes along, EQ2 is not it.

I leave you all now to comment whilest I go continue to finish Half-life 2

;)
