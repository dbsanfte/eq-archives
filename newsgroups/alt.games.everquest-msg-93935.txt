Something else here: Had to sign in. Ooh. 7 AOL screennames = 7 email
addresses. Hotmail has no limit that I know of.

Why would someone waste their time signing in on different email
addresses to skew a poll? I dunno, why do people waste their time
posting on Allakhazam's that a rusty dagger is worth 1kpp? Or trolling
newsgroups, for that matter?

Also to note, this poll, even if you rule out bogus poll skewing by
kids, samples only from people who take the game seriously enough to
seek out this poll and sign in to fill it out honestly, and then only
those who have interest in such statistics. That might not represent
an "average" sampling of the playerbase. In fact, I would say it
almost definately doesn't.

Controlled polling of selected groups done manually does usually have
a small margin of error. Opt-in polling on a website, however, usually
is far more skewed.
