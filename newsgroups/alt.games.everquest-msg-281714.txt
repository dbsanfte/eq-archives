not sure about the price as I'm in the UK ï¿½270 here but probably cheaper
in
USA as always :)  .... but I replaced my old 17" CRT monitor with a
Viewsonic VX912 19" LCD (8ms according to their spec) and I'm very happy
with it. No dead or faulty pixels and no ghosting on EQ2, HL2, CoD2 etc.
hooked up to my 6800 through the DVI cable.
