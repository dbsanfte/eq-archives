I'm thinking of giving a shot at a PvP server.  I haven't decided if it will
be Sullon Zek or not, but it sounds interesting.  EQ website lists the teams
as:

Dark Races - Comprised of Iksar, Dark Elves, Ogres, and Trolls
Short Races - Comprised of Dwarves, Halflings, and Gnomes.
Elven Races - Comprised of Half Elves, Wood Elves, and High Elves.
Human Races - Comprised of Humans, Erudites, and Barbarians.

My question is:  Where do the Vah Shir fit in to the teams?  They obviously
haven't updated their site.

Just wondering.
Have a good day.  Don't eat too much. (yeah, right!)
Sean...
