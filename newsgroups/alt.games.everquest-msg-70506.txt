Of course not.  I leveled my first character to 50 without a fungi.  I
leveled my second character to 50 without a fungi.  Now, I play in an
*active* raiding guild and enjoy it immensely.

Perhaps for the way you play.  For me the beastlord was *never* going to be
more than a "fun" character.

Fungi might not even make all *that* much of a difference.  I have a level
20 shaman with a fungi on that I don't play currently and might not ever
really get into.  Shaman was a departure for me, as I usually play damage
dealers, and after 20 levels I realized why I usually play damage dealers. 
Beastlord gave me the opportunity to play a "shaman" with more damage
dealing capability.  I can see that it might be a fun class, but I don't do
downtime anymore, and I'm not real fond of PL.

Worst comes to worst, if I found I did enjoy the beastlord that much, I'd
go camp it in the zone where the new fungi drops and get a CoH in to loot
when my group got one.  Pointless extra work since I have several fungi
already.
