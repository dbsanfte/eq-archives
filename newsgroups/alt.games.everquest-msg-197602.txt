Because it's my opinion, and opinion shouldn't be considered hard and
fast ever - in the presence of fact showing the opposite, I hope that
I am fleixble enough to change mine. :)  However, if I seemed overly
vehement, then I apologize for the misunderstanding.

Sorry, for me, work is work - anything is work, even if it's fun, if
it involves activity, either mental or physical.  But, that's my
interpretation.

Re: the obligatory bit...I rather like that!  One thing I've noticed
about thsi group since I started coming here - there seems to be a
lack of rancor in general when I compare this group to the others I
have frequented in the past.  I've been enjoying my time here
considerably as a result. :)
