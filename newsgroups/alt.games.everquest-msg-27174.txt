I may be thinking of the wrong NPC, but doesn't killing Lucan (or assisting)
make you instantly and irretrievably KOS with the militia? I mean, if I wanted
to do that, I could just go to West Commons and slaughter the guards while
killing orcs for a few days.  I'm hoping to accomplish this without becoming KOS
to Sgt. Slate, who can be the bane of all evil characters in the Auctionlands if
you're not watchful.
