Dont get me wrong, but why is it dark elves HAVE to have blue skin
(besides being consistant with EQ1 ;) This goes in line with the
concept that these are the exact same dark elves with the exact same
history as literary ones, which they arent. Sure, they are drawn from
other sources, but it doesnt mean that they have to be exactly the
same. With that thinking, why dont all gnomes in EQ1 wear those silly
tall red pointy hats or why arent elves all in polar wastelands
crafting toys? I could be way off here, but considering where dark
elves came from, thier supposed history and ecology (being mostly
subterranean dwellers), shouldnt thier skin be ghost white if they
live in darkness all the time? Of course that would not be cool
lookin, but SOE can really do whatever they see fit. This aint a flame
btw, just an opinion, as is yours ;)

I hope those pics on the front with the 2 humans are actual shots from
the game and not doctored... i agree - amazing looking. Being able to
select an age is an intruiging concept. I imagine thier character
creation process will be similar to SWG's model with tons of
customizations. Wouldnt it be interesting if your character actually
aged with time.
