That was in fact a great idea.. at least to the ones that still have their
"head" intact.. (You could imagine things like.. "damn.. where is my
polished golden vembraces now?? Or did i really have them.. hmm.. could have
sworn that the AC on my leather skullcap was in fact 26.. and a +150HP
bonus.. hmm does my hearing aid go in the range slot?")

Well.. i am not kidding.. I think it could be nice for old people or sick
people that are "bodily" sick to be able to escape reality, and "be young
and merry" again..

Anyway.. Missing one yellow to ding 30 :))
