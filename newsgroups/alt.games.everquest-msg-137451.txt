I've seen some custom UI's that have the buff as a tiny icon, and then the
buff name after it - i like that idea.  That tells you instantly at a glance
which buffs you have.. trying to figure out retarded images doesn't (look
how many use those silly blue hearts)

here here!

the cleric wasn't too effected.. the shamans spell book is totally ruined..
I daren't look at the wiz and mage spell books.  Least my SK wont be too
effected.. but thats mainly cuz I pleveled him totally, so he only has the
"really useful" ones.   He didnt even cast a spell before about level 35.
Most his spells are caught up now... undead spells are unusably low.. oh
well, when you have a 60cleric to plevel you, just kill the live stuff :)

Self only and other target/group spells had a different colour (as well as
conjuring items).  i didn't need ports at level 5 to learn the basics of
what a spells icon colour meant.

Fair point on that one.. in all my time playing a druid though (admittedly
not that much - my own to the teens, a friends 50-odd for porting) I've
never snared myself instead of casting sow.

I *did* have a druid snare himself in a duel with me one time tho :)
