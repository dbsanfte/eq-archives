Bah, first of all you don't know what you're talking about when you throw
around accusations like "idiots complaining in other games".. secondly, 
although I don't mind too other languages myself (and English isn't my 
native language either), a special channel for nonenglish chatter would
in my opinion only be beneficial in the long run. 

As how to enforce the use of such channel - dunno, Verant probably can't
enforce it, but the players themselves probably would. It's easier in 
MUDs where the imms can do whatever is necessary without any whining.
