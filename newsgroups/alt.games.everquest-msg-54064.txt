Heh! here's an easy one for a druid....     Into SK and left of the bridge,
eventually you will come across a band of raiders....kill em and loot the
sashes, goto Qeynos South and hand the sashes into Chesgard, sell the Bronze
weapons he hands ya, bind in that spot, then gate back to NK, repeat the
whole process..   I was earning 90pp an hour average there, at the same
level as you. Quick & easy cash earner until ya get your group ports....
