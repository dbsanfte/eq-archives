People at level 30 are still l4earning how to group *period*. I'm
playing my cleric in the Overthere right now and still see some really
scary things: Enchanters with pets, tanking clerics, AE aggro on goons
in an all-DE party. It's time to work out the kinks.

You're absolutely right about necros being a big unknown in group
situations, but I should mention that it can go all the way up to 60
(or, at least, within whispering distance of 55 IME)

This is the one I'll actually tell my healers: Unless I am at risk of
immediate demise, I will ask when I need a heal. OTOH, regeneration
spells are exceptionally welcome. As an Iksar with natural regen,
chloro can more or less cancel out the deleterious effects of lich.

As a higher-level necromancer, I will often throw a "ghetto heal" onto
a chanter or other robe seemingly in need of one. Several hundred hit
points can be a life of death thing and, if you have Bond of Death up
at the same time, you generally won't even notice any change in your
own health. Besides, if it DOES effect my health, I can always toss a
drain into combat.

One big exception: hit point buffs. Hit points = Mana. The symbol/aego
line on a necro is a gift that gives back. Oh, yeah. Make sure to
symbol the shaman too, mana and peridots permitting.

>If you SOW the group, remember the pet. Don't want it to get left behind!

Consider another option. If you can, sit the pet down before the group
runs off, run to your new location, and cast Summon Companion. This
will keep your pet from picking up random aggro on the run over.

Other than myself, I almost never see anyone use this incredibly
useful little spell.

Dealing damage is your primary role in-group as a necromancer. At 54,
I've pretty much given up on nukes as a necromancer. They take too
long to cast, are too mana efficient, and can sometimes make
targetting difficult as they turn the MOb into a human skeleton (Note
to Verant: This spell would be *much* cooler if every critter had a
"skeleton skin" of its own.) for a limited time.

In most fights, my role is wait for pull, assist the puller, send in
the pet, drop Bond of Death on the target and, if it's a big sumbitch
or a multi-critter pull, Splurt and possibly a third DoT. If it looks
like CC is showing a strain or my BoD timing is off, I will also drain
as a finisher. If there's time, I'll bleed off the HPs I'm about to
drain to a party member first. This keeps me as close to full mana as
I can get and will still do about 2-3k spell damage and 3k pet damage.
(I can't wait for my monk pet at 56.)

Necros, remember feign death and hotkey it. You get aggro, FD before
your ****skin line wears off. It helps if you let the party know you
are FDing so they don't hit you with a heal and ruin it unless it's
critical to do so.

Or, pull with darkness. Unless it's a long pull, this will start the
damage process *and* snare.

I figure that anybody who doesn't know this still probably also thinks
that clerics aren't pulling their weight because they constantly have
their nose in a book. If they speak up, they won't last long.

Necromancers are the great utility infielders of EverQuest. Other than
DoTs, there's nothing we completely outstrip another class at, but
there's very little we can't do.
