For those wondering how a hiding/sneaking rogue can screw up, since
hide/sneak last until you turn them off, there are two things about
Lower Guk that make hide/sneak not a total no-brainer like they are
in most other places:

1. Swimming.  You can't start hide/sneak while swimming.  You swim very
slowly while sneaking.  For lower level rogues, some of the swims needed
in LGuk can't be made with sneak on, unless you have someone to cast a
breathing spell on you, or you have an EB item.

2. The bats in LGuk see through hide/sneak.
