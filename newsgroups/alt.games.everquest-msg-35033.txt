I think you will find more of a link between characters' levels and player
maturity.  The higher your character gets, the easier it is to level if you
can find good groups; of course there are some exceptions.  It's easier to
find good groups if you show some maturity in the way you act and the way
you learn how to group well for your class.  People will remember you and
want you back.

If you act like a child, /ooc and /shout nonsense, refuse to do what your
group leader asks, etc, you are going to be less apt to level unless you are
a good soloer.

It will also be easier to find a good ( my definition of good ) guild if you
are more mature.

I was in my newest "Best Group Ever" last night in the Sarnak Fort.
Unfortunately, the group only lasted 1 hour before it broke up.  I only had
2 hours to play, so I went to the mill and breezed / quickened people and
debuffed Mobs for the next hour.  Grabbed a Walrus Tooth for my Warrior, as
per the suggestions in this NG.  It was a good night for only getting to
play for 2 hours.
