Hey guys,

The Planetary Gaming Community is now looking for people to join our team.
We are 7 months old and the site is still only in beta stage.  This reason
is due to lack of developers and time the current developers have.  If you
have any skills of such, we encourage all php/mysql experienced persons to
apply.

Even if you dont know that, we do have various positions for you guys to
apply for, you can apply at http://www.planetarygaming.net/joinus.php

Also we would love to meet all you gamers out there, so if you use IRC, you
can join us today here:

irc.planetarygaming.net #planetarygaming.

Im trying to keep this short and simple.

We are still doing our FREE XBox360 Contest for those who are interested,
you can find out more details here:
http://www.planetarygaming.net/boards/viewthread.php?tid=26

If you register for the forums you get 2 free entries to the contest as this
is a premium contest.  All registrations must be done by the end of the
summer for the free entries, after that it's $1 per entry.  We plan on
picking a winner around October or so.

We have great potential, all we need is your support to help us out.  All
developers have a chance to earn money off this project as well.

If you would like to know who we are, and what we do, you can read about us
here: http://www.planetarygaming.net/boards/viewthread.php?tid=26

Again here is a reference to all the things I just mentioned:

Want to join our crew?  Select a position here:
