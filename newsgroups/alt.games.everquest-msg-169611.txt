"Hit with Wrath" - cleric nuke. Not being hit by melee. We weren't
being meleed. I share the experience of being attacked through a hut
wall with most other people here, but this was a nuke, not a melee attack.
Being a wurm, its melee attacks would have been nasty, but none of
us reported being meleed.

Atmittedly I think it's likely the MOB was under the world. But we were
being *nuked* from below the world, and the ground wasn't transparent.

So maybe the range wasn't a factor (I realise vertical displacement is
not supposed to be a factor in MOB range calculations), but
line-of-sight definitely was.
