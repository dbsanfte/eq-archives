I *love* LDONs.  Now that I have found the *allakhazam's gear sorting where I
can pick *only LDON gear* I've also picked up some really nice pieces and MR
augs too, (I think thats a *premium* service not sure tho).
I'm curious tho why you stay in LDONs to *keep up*?  If I didn't like them, I
wouldn't do them.
