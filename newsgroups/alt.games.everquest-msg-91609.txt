I completely forgot to comment on this one in my first response to you,
James, but I thought it was a very important point. The whole concept of
"killing stuff just so others can't" is, IMO, an inaccurate and jealosy
based reaction from the "others" in question, who "can't."  Why? Because
I don't see it as UberGuild_01 waking the sleeper so others "can't". I
think they would do it because *they* ......... *CAN*. And it can only
be done once.

Again, if you want to throw the tag of "assholes" on somebody, toss it
on Verant if you disagree with the way the Sleeper's zone was
implemented. Not on the Uberguild that completes the script and plays
the zone as the designers intended it to be played.
