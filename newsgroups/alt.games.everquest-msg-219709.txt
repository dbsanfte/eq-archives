No, it is right.  Let me tell a little story.  Once upon a time there was a
computer game that was very hard to win.  A friend of mine, however, seemed
to have no trouble winning.  He'd sit down at a terminal in the computing
center, and, within about 30 minutes, have won.  He had all the top scores,
and whenever anyone would get onto the top 10 list, usually after trying all
day and night, my friend would come in, sit down, and push them off.

People watched him play, and no one could see that he was really any better
than the rest of us...he just won where we lost.

Eventually, he explained to us.  He simply was *slightly* better at *every
aspect* of the game.  For example, if he needed to explore a dark room, he
would step on the minimal number of squares necessary to explore the room.
The rest of us would not be so careful, so would step on more squares.  This
meant that he had a *slightly* lower chance than us of hitting a trap.  So?
Traps were almost never fatal in that game...just knock you down a few hit
points for a while.  But if the next fight was going to be one of those
close ones where you win by 2 HP...and you are down 4 HP from a trap, well,
sucks to be you.

Similarly, if he had to go back through a room he'd been in before, he would
only step on the squares he'd stepped on when he was there earlier...so he
never tripped traps on his way back out of the dungeon (to win the game, you
had to go down 26 levels of a dungeon, get an item, and come back out).

He had dozens of things like this, each small, and unlikely to individually
ever make a noticable difference, but 100 1% improvements adds up.

Many things in EQ work that same way.  One individual thing you do to
improve, say, mana regen, or HP regen, or resist, or whatever, probably
won't make a difference, but when you do it a lot, it adds up.

...
> tick actually mean? Otherwise why would a FT1 item cost so darned much.

FT1 items cost so much because there are very few tradeable FT items in the
game.  The only "cheap" FT item that I know of is not tradeable, but can be
made from parts that are tradeable (I'm talking about the Earring of
Solstice).  The total price for the parts ranges from about 3.5K to 7K on my
server.
