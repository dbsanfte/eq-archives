This post is in good order, as its a response to my calling you out of order.  Similarly,
my post calling you out of order is also in order...if you grant that you were out of order
(thus I made my case for that)

Just to rebut: I say that splitting AA and real exp is silly... in comparison to doing it
100%.

Not that its silly compared to world hunger.  Not that its silly compared to the rusty
short sword issue.

Silly only on a scale of "whats the best way of handling AA versus Real" exp.

Since "whats the best way of handling AA versus Real" is the topic, no matter how silly
that topic is compared to other topics we might touch on, its within the bounds of the
arguement to, well, actually discuss the relative merits of one split style or another.

I didn't propose kicking someone out of a guild or a group or my friends list because
they've made other split descisions.  I agree, its no big deal, has practically no impact,
and is certainly a personal choice.

However, if there's one thing I think I've demonstrated in this newsgroup, its that I'm
willing to chime in with an opinion on practically anything.  I enjoy debate and arguement
as long as it remains civil.  I've been wrong before, and admitted it.  I've been right
before, and not crowed overmuch.  More often than either, I've had a strong opinion that
isn't shared by everyone else, and no-one's opinions were changed by debate, but at least I
got to see the points of view of others, and others got to see mine, giving us all
something to think about.

If nobody stated opinions for fear of trodding upon toes, we'd have to close the newsgroup
down for lack of interest.
