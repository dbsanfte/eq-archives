I've had it suggested that I'll do more damage nuking and
medding to full than I would doing melee.

So it occurs to me, what I need is a DPS calculation
for nuke plus med back the nuke mana.

I'm a cleric, casting Judgement for 925 damage, at
a 325 mana cost (not specialized in Evoc, and no
focus items to make it cheaper)

My meditation skill is maxed out, plus I have a
5% boost to meditate skill from Cloak of Truth.
Further, I have an FT1 item, and constantly run
BAotR.

Total time then, is Cast time plus time to med back
that much mana.  Most mobs, most of the time,
I land for full nuke damage, for the sake of arguement
lets assume I do.

Unbuffed, how long will that take me?

How about with KEI ( a not infrequent occurrance)

Whats my DPS, then when including the med, either
case?
