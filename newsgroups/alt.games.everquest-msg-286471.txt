[snip more in same vein]

This doesn't sound like character-related files; it sounds more like
your files for that zone are corrupted.  Once you used Return Home
and got in okay, what happens if try to go back to the problem zone?
What happens if a different character tries to zone into there?

Assuming that your client is disconnecting whenever any character
tries to log into a particular zone, I'd suggest removing all files
relating to that zone (especially the map files; I've definitely seen
this symptom when the map data is malformatted), doing a full file
check to replace any essential files, and then trying again.
