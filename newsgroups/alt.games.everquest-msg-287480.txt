The Introduction


Dear Sir;

The Green Gate is a system aiming at teaching the Arabic Language to
non-Arabic speakers. Despite differences in race, religion, and
nationalities, Arabic would be the language of communication,
instruction and teaching in class and the computer, the medium to
fulfill this purpose. This language system is devised to enable a
learner attend a class within a group study atmosphere. Competent
instructors who are devoted to carry out their tasks in the most
appropriate manner frequently assist learners. In such a motivating
and learning environment, a learner is involved in a very interactive
learning arena in which there is no absentmindedness or distraction,
for the learner himself is the major dynamic factor of the class. In
such program, it is in the hands of the learner to accelerate the
learning and teaching process and frequency of repeating materials in
accordance with his skills and capacity.

The TGG language system contains a number of levels, which are
subdivided into units. A learner ends up with an average of 650-700
credit hours. The TGG relies on establishing and running accredited
language centers abided by the approved conditions of the system. Also
it also relies on professional instructors who keep track of the
learners=92 learning progress and aid learners through solving problems
in language learning.

Thus, if you are interested in our offer-to work under the supervision
of the TGG and its umbrella-we would be more than glad to provide you
with necessary data and information appertaining to establishing one
or more classrooms to teach Arabic to non-Arabic speakers.

With our Best Compliments.
