This is true, for one person.  My lvl 40 druid was sitting on the dock in
the oasis trying to med to regain her mana to go kill the sand giant that
was plaguing the zone but was completely unable to because people kept
innundating her with "Sow pls"  "Buffs pls" "DS pls".  Most of the ones they
ask for i have to memorize.  Sometimes I just can't do it.

My favorite is when i'm in the middle of kiting a named giant or some other
hard creature and they run up to me, in between me and my prey and say "Can
I get a sow?" or other some such nonsense.

I had someone hail me while I was fighting the other day.  Like i'm gonna
turn around and say, "Yes?  I would love to help you right now so I can die
miserably."

Sorry, just had to rant.
