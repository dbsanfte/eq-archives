As an aside, I never allow anything except the volume control and the
task manager sit in the system tray when I run EQ.  Some (many? most?)
of the apps that want to hang out there are very sloppy with how they
interact with the OS/GUI and I've had enough problems that I just don't
permit anything to live there anymore.  Makes life much simpler.  The
utilities from video card manufacturers are probably the worst offenders
(I had similar problems with the Diamond Monster Fusion on my old system
a couple years back, got rid of the stupid system tray app and EQ quit
hanging/crashing) but I don't allow those damned instant messenger, web
browser, office suite, or anti-virus launchers in either.  They're evil,
slay them all!
