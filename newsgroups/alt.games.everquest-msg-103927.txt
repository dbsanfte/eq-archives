Actually, Permafrost is a dungeon, but Everfrost (I am sure that is what you
meant) is a very good place for HQ pelts.  They even drop off of the cubs,
which means that some of the newbies will have them and will gladly sell
them and sometimes they can even be found on vendors where they were sold by
newbies who did not know how much they were worth.  It is also a pretty good
source of HQ cat, which I think are used for quivers.
