Well I and many others object to it simply because it takes the
longest. You have to clear usually as far as an assassination target
and you can't skip any because the fellow won't move when mobs are
near. You usually don't get two rescues in a row so its no biggy to
skip and try again.

Well you can chalk it up to a verified problem on test now (though 26
seems to be fine). Lower number collection missions are buggy, period.
26 and over can usually be done faster than any other mission.

No one I know will take a collection 25 and under period now.
