I don't think the mob was bugged but it has an insane regen rate. If I
remember correctly our shaman and necro added their dot damage together
and concluded something about 1000 HP/tick regen. So you have to do more
damage than 1000/tick. It is a fun fight once you have your strategy
down. Just keep the adds controlled and wear him down.
And never ever melee him when he has the hammer equipped. :D
