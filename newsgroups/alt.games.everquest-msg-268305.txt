Why didn't he look to the guilds below you for a solution?  I imagine most
guilds below have gone through the exact same process, and if you could of
absorbed 20 or so of them, even with the gear difference, you could at least
still raid, and have a building block to carry on from.

Wow.  The next patch will introduce a 15% rule for PoTime (amongst other
zones).
But even so - qvic and txevu would be a better solution to gear people fast.
12 drops a day, 2 hours work, every third day 16 loots, plus random named in
the zone.   Its also armour a serious level above PoTime

What about a guild behind instead of infront then?

20 would of been enough for the WW fight sadly enough.  Maybe in this age of
guilds collapsing, some kinda PU raids will thrive?

Tacvi>> no you don't want to see it!
Anguish is an ok zone.
Which MPG trials did you never win? (Mind and Realms?)  Mind was never
really much fun :p Going through hell to spawn the named, who then melees
for upto 10k :)

People have said EQ was dead/dieing since DaoC, PoP, LdoN raids, GoD... its
still going strong.  And if the newer games lack substance.. it will be
another CoH/L2 all over again. Sure it drags people away for a while.  But
they all end up returning, eventually!
