Apparently then nothing new can ever be created, according to you.

How shortsighted.

Just because David Allen couldn't do it doesn't mean it can't be done,
you know.

No, Charles, it doesn't. It just invalidates David's chance at them.

You seem to be holding a great deal of hostility towards David Allen.
It boggles the mind that you are incapable of seeing the virtue of
trying to do something new even if you prove yourself unable in the
event to pull it off (or even come close).

Indeed, you are the very sort of person the author was railing against
- the one that the newer mmorpgs are pandering to with the eq-clones,
because you refuse to see there might be another way. It is your kind
of thinking that has us saddled with nothing but C&C/Warcraft clones
in the rts market and Doom clones in the fps market.

But luckily, for you and for me, theres occasionally someone who
breaks away from the clones you adore so much and makes something
refreshingly new DESPITE that sort of player.

Even hardcore fans of Horizons admit that it was watered down in order
to salvage any kind of release date. Whatever you want to think,
that's exactly what happened. If you're denying this, you yourself
lose credibility.

They turned it into yet another EQ clone. So what if it makes money
(and its not projected to by its own publishers, btw). The author is
pointing out that theres still a market out there for things other
than EQ clones, and that it had a chance to be something like that and
threw it away due to 1. lack of skill in the developer and 2. lack of
ambition from the publisher.

It appears you yourself have a massive personal bias in this; it is
making it hard to get a common ground. When an article spends maybe
10% of its text talking about a certain game and you latch onto it
like thats all its about, ignoring everything else, its fairly hard to
escape notice.

Are you trying to evade the point by playing with semantics? You know
EQ's numbers as well as I do. He pointed out the numbers for
old-school private UO shards. The numbers for DAoC at release were
recordbreaking - was it 100k in the first week? SWG, which also had a
nod towards the world-style game also had to have very high numbers
(though I've never seen them given). On the other hand, AC - tiny
playerbase. AC2 - even smaller, last I heard it was under 5k. Horizons
- not going to be the EQ-killer it was trumped to be; too early to
know subscriber numbers and they wouldn't be reliable anyways with the
billing problems. I haven't seen AO in over a year but it was never
very large either. There's a website with all the subscription
numbers; I lost it when I changed computers but I'm sure you can find
it if you want to look for yourself.

If you are looking for hardcoded proof that there is a market for the
old-school world style games, you've given an impossible challenge -
until there is one its impossible to say. But the evidence he gave is
quite good that there is. Burying your head and pretending its just
"speculation" doesn't change that.
