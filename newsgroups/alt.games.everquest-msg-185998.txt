Personally, I find it pretty "common and mundane" to run across 9 - 11 zones
in order to get to a destination (that's from Qeynos to Freeport, depending
on which route you take).  I would compare it to driving in real life.  Do
you drive just for the sake of it, or to get to your destination?  Some
people do the former, some the latter.  Nothing is inherently wrong with
either.  And it has been pointed out repeatedly that no one is stopping
anyone else from making a long run if that's what they want to do.

With all that said, give me faster travel any day.
