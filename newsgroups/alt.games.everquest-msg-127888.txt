The .map files were created by people running around zones in
the usual manner, doing tons of /locs as they traversed landmarks
and zone walls and dungeon passageways, then using programs
to extract the info and collate them into the .map files.

The MapFiend site is no longer available, but when it was
up there were lengthy instructions on how to do this,
and requests for people to go survey new zones and email
their /loc logs to the MapFiend site so they could generate
additional .map files.
