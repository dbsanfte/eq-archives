A gamey mmorpg is a lot more like a chat room than a worldy one. A
chat room and a pocket dimension. The chatroom happens to be
graphical.

That is a narrow view. I don't hold it. A mmorpg can still be an rpg,
if done with that in mind.

That is what I just said. Since you could get your LDoN gear doing the
same thing you know you already can beat, you just keep doing it until
you get enough points. No need to do anything else.

To someone obsessed with having to have a piece of gear, it probably
would. But I see characters and mmorpgs as potentially being more than
spreadsheets.

Sufficient content, variable spawn locations, yadda yadda. Already
addressed.

So your argument is that because someone high level could bust an
Unrest train, the Unrest mobs should include mobs capable of killing
that trainbuster in the name of "balance". 

The sort of interactivity I was referring to would be everything
*other* than more people actually joining your group, since that
reduces it back to single group game.

Sure, but its not something any mmorpg does well. Single group games
do it far better. It's only "dominant" because every dev jumped on the
bandwagon and shoved out EQ clones. Much like examples in every other
genre.

Other than the fact instancing does destroy interactivity, of course.
Already addressed the problems with players wanting to be "the hero"
in a mmorpg full of "heroes".

The argument that a world can't be entertaining is fundamentally
flawed. UO proved it can even with all its problems. Imagine a worldy
UO like world with UO's problems actually solved. By the way SimEarth
was considered a bit of a classic to many people, as a recent thread
in csipg.strat showed.

You're locked into your preconceptions of what works. If everyone
thought like that all games would be exactly the same.
