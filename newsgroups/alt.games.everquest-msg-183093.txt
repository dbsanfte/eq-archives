haha yea i fought an NPC there, it was a friggn bandit. I was chilln wait
for orge shaman to spawn wiht a friend, and a friggn bandit hit me while i
was sittn, So i sicked my dog on it to make the nusence go away, and then
relized they the bandit lost only 1 tick of HP in the 10 mins my dog was
fighting it, my dog usualy droppes the bandits withn 10 secs, but wow, so i
decide to unload on it, nuke nuke nuke, (400 hp per nuke) till i was oom,
and it wasn't even down 4 ticks of hp. so my friend unloaded on it 2(while
my dog isstil beating away on this thing) so i medded bak up and unloaded on
it again, took 5 full bars of mana to kill it off... x2 casue there were 2
of us unloading on it to kill it off . we kept at it thinking it would be
special spawn.. hahah what a waste of time.... Id hate be be the lvl 14ish
