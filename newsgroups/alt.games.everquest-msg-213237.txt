True, but it demonstrates a complete and utter lack of testing.

Items that do cause big problems like disconnects are inexcusable, and 
now we know how those get into the game... nobody over in testing so 
much as equips them.

So what? Their monthly revenue on EQ is also HUGE. What can you compare 
it too? MMRPGs are in a revenue class of their own... granted their 
bigger games than traditional titles sure... but they generate fabulous 
amounts of revenue too. In fact they are disproportionately profitable, 
because they have the revenue from initial purchases, just like regular 
titles, next to zero piracy if any at all, and then on top of that 
they've got subscription fees that are amply covering costs. DiabloII 
covered initial devlopment, 10 major patches, an online server component 
that is still up today, all paid for out of initial box sales at or less 
than $60.00. SOE on the other does have considerably greater 
requirements both in terms of backend hardware, bandwidth requirements, 
and game complexity... but then I've paid over $600.00 for EQ.... so far...

So yeah EQ is HUGE. But EQ is priced HUGE too.

Do they have a process in place to mitigate this? Do they have databases 
analogous to alla's with zones, mobs, drops, quest items, differing only 
in that its actually accurate and complete :p ?

Do content changes get validated against that database for impact? 
Because if they had the database, and they had a process for this, this 
wouldn't be nearly the major undertaking you suggest.

Do they run through a new quest to validate that it actually works? 
Simply set up a character with the minimum specified factions and run 
through it... im sure they have the power to force kill a mob. For each 
type of mob they force kill, travel to the zone, validate that its on 
the spawn table, verify that it is set to pop "enough" (particularly for 
newbie/lowbie quests), verify that the required item is on its drop 
table "enough", then simply generate the item (im not suggesting they 
actually camp it), and so on... and at the end validate its stats and 
equip it, and check that the graphics work on each character type that's 
supposed to wear it....

Sure it would be onerous to go back and do this for each quest, but even 
if they put one guy on it, it wouldn't take *that* long to perform a 
complete scrubdown... but I'm really suggesting this stuff should be in 
place at least for new quests.

It would eliminate many of the bonehead mistakes.

And I agree with you. *But* they are making a profit from this game. I 
just don't happen to agree with their evident policy of ensuring the 
greatest profits by performing the least amount of testing/customer 
service they can get away with, ie without pissing their subscriber base 
off to the point of quitting.

There simply isn't enough good competition in this arena yet to force 
companies to have to fight for subscribers. With decent competition SoE 
*could* and *would* run EQ less profitably, with much greater emphasis 
on service, because the bar will have been raised on the "least amount 
of service they can get away with".
