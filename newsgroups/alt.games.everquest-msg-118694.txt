After Cab Mystic Scale what is the next better armor or for a Iksar Shammie?
I'd also like any advice on a weapon better then a hollowing Harpoon, and a
Shield better then the Charred Guardian Shield.

I've seen a Shield of Battle and they seem rare on my server, any ideas on
this Shield?

Thanks again for your advice follow Shammie and advice givers.  Appreciate
yah!

Frederick J.
