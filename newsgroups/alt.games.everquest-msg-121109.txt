** Emergency Patch **

- Fixed the zone between Iceclad and Eastern Wastes.
- Fixed the firepot room in Timorous Deep.
- Updated a handful of zones to fix a problem with NPCs spawning in
the wrong place.
- Fixed the graphics cache issue that was causing characters'
inventories to appear with the wrong item icons.
