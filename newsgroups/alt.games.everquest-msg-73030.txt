For me its "ify"  Sometimes (90% or  so) it actually takes me to desktop,
other times its just like /camp

Same goes for /camp char taking me to the character select screen.  At first
I assumed I mistyped the desktop or char part, but I've double checked
(doing shift-up) just before exiting to make sure and still had it drop me
to the server screen.

My guess is its just a hikkup in the timing of something.
