Well I've been playing DAoC since early beta 2 and I can say it's a great
game.  As for AO I beta tested it I think a few days or a week before it
went live and I knew right then and there that it wasn't all that.  From
what I heard it was less then a month before people started fleeing AO.
Also theres not really many problems with DAoC, they have major plans for
it, and they are listening to their customers on what they really want in
the game.  They are even doing an exp pak thats at least 300 meg, not sure
what all it adds but they said all new graphics, which they talked about
since beta.
