    Tradeskillers that have the skill at max when a new product comes out,
and who can either buy the compoents from people who don't know what they're
used for or who can farm them themselves can make incredible money. The
remaining tradeskillers can make slow money. You also need a fairly
significant capital base if you want to "break in" to a tradeskill.

    And more importantly, the people have to NOT know what items you require
to make those items. Once everyone knows what you can make with a given
item, they look at the current sale price and try and eat a significant
chunk of it with their price. "I want my share, too! You won't rip me off!"
Too bad the prices on components seem to be set by people assuming the
tradeskiller has 100% success rate. These component costs also drop slower
than the cost on the tradeskilled item, and rarely see the price wars that
happen with tradeskill products.

    Every night, I check The Bazaar for opportunities to purchase "good"
supplies, stuff I know I can turn a profit on. There's nothing there most
nights. The only successful "pro" tradeskillers go from zone to zone,
auctioning like mad to scoop stuff as it drops from people who don't know
any better.

    Those bows, the PoEarth bow in particular, are much more desireable than
the average tradeskill item by orders of magnitude. You might have read
about what happened with the elemental planes on my server, Quellious.
Basically, three guilds (two are a normal guild alliance) banded together,
threw 180 people at Rallos Zek, and flagged themselves for elemental planes
by brute force. They claimed it was so they could progress, and not be
"cockblocked". This is what they've done since they got flagged:

    Guild A farms PoEarth for bow components off regular mobs. Their
guildmaster sells plat on playerauctions, and we suspect he's fleecing them
royally. They sell all other rare tradeskill items to vendors, so they don't
seem interested in anything other than bows. They also farm the nameds in
PoFire when we don't beat them to it (PoFire has the best risk/reward). They
have stepped into Water and Air once each, got wiped, and never went back.
They also still kill Emperor in Ssra, do Vex Thal once every three weeks on
a rotation, hell they even kill Avatar of War when they find him up.

    Guild B farms PoEarth for bow components off regular mobs. They sell all
other tradeskill items to vendors, so they don't seem interested in anything
other than bows. They scout PoFire, but they can't mobilize fast enough to
beat ourselves or Guild A to it. They haven't gone into Air, but they have
killed some nameds in Water when we didn't get there fast enough. They do
"lesser" PoP content to flag folks, do VT once every three weeks, and still
do some events like the Ring of Vulak which only they do.

    Compare with us. We've killed Fennin Ro, are farming keys for Xegony,
have spawned the Corinav event. We raid Fire, Water, Air, and Sol Ro's Tower
on a regular basis and very little else (/hug three day respawns). The only
plane we don't "do" is Earth, mostly because the ring events are easily
blown by people doing XP there (like the members of "A" and "B" farming bow
components).

    Compare with another guild on my server, guild "C". C has never killed
Emperor or gone to Vex Thal. When PoP came out, they were second after us to
have most members at level 65. They went straight to BoT and PoS as opposed
to PoV, were the first on the server to kill Agnarr and try several other
PoP bosses. They are now working on Rallos Zek the Warlord, having got him
down to 60% with 60 people. They usually have between 30 and 40 people on
for raids, and have made that much progress. They also refuse to group up
with A or B to kill Rallos, whom neither A nor B have yet killed by
themselves (A and B wiped to RZtW with 150 people combined at one point).

    The conclusion I've drawn is this: guild A wanted to kill Rallos so they
could farm bows in Earth, and whatever other "easy" content was available.
They have little interest in progressing through PoP except if it leads to
easy loot. Guild B wanted to kill Rallos to farm bows in PoEarth, and to add
a few possible raid targets when nothing else is up. They will try to
progress through PoP, but mostly they wanted the bows (and to spite us, bad
blood between the two guilds). So yeah, the bows are good. ;-)
