I've used Redhat and Mandrake and IPTables in the past, but the Linux box 
is now my second EQ machine.  I have the parts to fire up a PII-400 just 
for NATting if I have to, but prefer to get what I currently have running.

I may end up going with just a floppy booted Linux system with nothing but 
what is needed to get NATting and the firewall running.
