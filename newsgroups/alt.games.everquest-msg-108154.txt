You need to set a trigger condition, or make yourself a hotkey; shaman
and eventually mages are in the same boat, but necros tend to solo more
and so don't necessarily think in terms of what the rest of the group is
looking at.

Normally, a cleric's response to a plummetting HP bar is to throw a heal
in there of one kind or another.  Shamen cannabalize and use regen to
work as a secondary clarity, necros lich up and use lifetap the same
way... but in each case, the cleric is supposed to ignore a certain amount

of HP loss.

The necro, shaman, and mage are not supposed to get aggro, (like any
other member of the party save the MA and regrettably the enchanter)
so you are already low on the attention cycle.  Now remove HP loss
as an alert flag, and you become almost invisible.

I like HP suckers to tell me they won't go below 3 bubs or 2 bubs of
HP, giving me at least something to watch for, but a 'HEAL PLEASE'
hotkey is also a very good idea.

Something I still see from time to time are suckers that will go down
very low on HP deliberately... and then die almost instantly from
the little known fact that very low HP is a tuant, and one or two blows
is enough to take them down.  Mages who have recently acquired
Mod 2 are the worst for this, generally necros and shamen have learned
the bitter lessons that HP abuse can kill...while the mages are excited
about their new toy and the astonishing power it provides them.
