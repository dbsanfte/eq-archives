I have a lvl 65 druid, and i would love to find a place to quad db
cons at lvl 62+.  Umbrous toilers in ME at lvl 61 was the last
quadding i did.  Wizzies seem to find it very challenging to solo past
lvl 62, although i have seen them, but its much tougher.  And all the
wizzies in my guild find they are very undesired for groups.
