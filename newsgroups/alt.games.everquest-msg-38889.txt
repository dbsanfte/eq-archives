Any limit, if it exists, relies on what kind of variable EQ uses to store
money,  and I'm not sure if money is stored as a single variable or 4
variables, one each for plat, gold, silver and copper.   I would imagine
that to be as efficient as possible and still allow for capitalist
megaplatinaires (is that even a word?) it would use 4 variables.

Depending on whether or not anyone has reached  4294967295pp, I would say
that plat is stored in an unsigned integer variable, whose range is 0 to
4294967295 ( since no one can have negative pp), if someone has had more
than that, then it woul have to be stored in an unsigned double integer,
with range up into the 10^300 area, give or take a few digits.

And honestly, if anyone has greater than 10^300pp, they have WAY WAY WAY too
much time on their hands, or they did something odd, like bribe a GM or
manage to hack the character servers.
