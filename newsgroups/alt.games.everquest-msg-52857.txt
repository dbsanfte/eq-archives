Excuse me, but I think we're talking about differnent mobs here.
Maybe for AoW or whatever, true uber-mobs, but I'm thinking of big
mobs with AE damage.  Of course you're going to have your main tank
keeping aggro, and two or three other tanks ready to jump in and grab
aggro after the main tank dies (hey, it happens, clerics aren't
perfect).  
Melee bind-rushing isn't doing to do much on a perfectly executed
battle, but if the main tank should lose aggro for any reason,
especially when trying to maintain mob in position, the difference
between those 5 rogues/monks being there or not may make a difference.
Notice I didn't say anything about tanks bind-rushing, I said damage
dealers, there is a difference.  Think about the difference that melee
binding would have on a small-scale ToV run, say 24 folks breaking
from zone-in.  Pulling two isn't a problem now, pulling 4 wouldn't be
that tough if your damage dealers could immediately zone back and
commence to fighting.  It's not going to completely change the game,
but will make significant changes to level-appropriate battles.

I personally have no problems with melee binding, in the same way that
I have no problems in not being able to port.  It's a game limitation
that forces you to plan around it.  Personally, being limited to
binding in limited locations actually makes it easier for me to find
places to hunt.  I just stay bound in Kael and can either get TL to
bind or Dreadlands and have about 8 places to hunt within a 15 minute
run.  But I guess bards running faster than other classes is broken
too.
