   The reason I ask is that although I have played many, many classes, I've never
gotten a cleric higher than 14.  Still, this is the class I choose as my main in FV,
and is what I'll probably be playing more or less exclusively (my interest in playing
any other server than FV is minimal, now.  I feel like I've come home).  I choose a
cleric for a few reasons; because I do enjoy being the group's healer with my shaman,
Lenny is a warrior and in the long run will probably benefit most, IMO, from a cleric
partner, and because I figured that clerics might be in relatively short supply on
low population, single character server where many have chosen to play classes that
traditionally solo better.
   So far, so good.  I've been working on both my defensive and offensive skills. 
Lenny and I can duo yellow and low reds pretty well.  My guild has a shortage of both
clerics and warriors, so we are already considered valuable additions. Right now
their best tank is a half-elf ranger, and the only other warriors they have are a
couple of elves and half elves.  Lenny has by far the most "heavy tank" potential of
the whole guild.  And there are only 2 or 3 other clerics, that I know of.  
   So, what can I expect as I get older?  Am I doomed to have to sit on my ass, only
watching health, as I get older?  I know that I won't be a puller (which is a shame,
because with my other characters, I do seem to have a talent for it), but can I be
anything more than a healer and pre-fight buffer?  I would appreciate any insight or
advice from other clerics, or those who might have some constructive comments about
the class.
