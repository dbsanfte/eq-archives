In your EQ folder is a file called DataRate.txt.  The file consists of a
single number between 1 and 9.  The higher the number, the faster the
exchange of data, and the less time it takes to zone.  However if your
system is unable to process the data at the rate you've set you will
disconnect.

Try changing the number to a lower value.  You may need to try a few before
you find the highest number that works for you.
