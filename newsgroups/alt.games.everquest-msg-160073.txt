I do appreciate those who weed through the log files gathering the empirical
data, the analysis can be quite chanllening!

www.steelwarrior.org has some great threads on combat items, and am not sure
if this topic has been addressed, but the research done on mob and PC damage
is very interesting.  It is from here that I and steered more towards simple
solutions rather than more complicated ones.

Thanks for the feedback.
