As usual, I would say,  your understanding is spot on except you're not
taking into account his level.
AFAIK the best AC BP he could wear would be Cobalt, everything else is
either no drop or level restricted. Of course that is still AC45 over AC21
but look at it this way, AC21 is only one short of Crafted (what level did
you upgrade to Crafted?) plus a crap load of regen that far excedes any buff
he'll be getting from group member.

If he was 45+ and could then wear the high end player made armour then I'd
agree with you but until the 40's I would stick with the Fungi for Chest. I
take it his legs are at least 20+ Dragonleg Breeches and arms are at least
CC, on top of that he could also wear AC26 Blood Runed Gaunts and Helm of
Raldukan. The fungi will also pretty much hold it's value so when he can
upgrade to a more appropriate chest piece he can sell it for little loss and
pay far less for an out of date BP or get one of the newer ones (that are
bound to come with LoY)

At 25th that would be about AC23 on him, my mule is 22nd level and I am
certain when I bought my Teir'dal Regent BP it's AC was low 20's to me, on
inspect.
