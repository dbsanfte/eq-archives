Once you hit 35 the spell book is no longer needed (you just sit to med).
This makes it way more interesting to med.   At this point your job becomes
heal and screenshot taker.

Got a 50 cleric, and dont think he has solod since low 20's.   Just not
worth the effort.    And definitly far easier to level up a cleric in a
group.  If I need a break from grouping, I switch to my necro.

If I stand up and start smacking the mob with a weapon, the rest of the
group just assume I am at full mana.   If I am not, then I shouldn't be in
melee.
