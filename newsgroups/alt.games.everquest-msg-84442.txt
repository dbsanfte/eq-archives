Then don't do the quest!  Stop right now!

If the character doing the quest has a lore item anywhere
on his person (which includes the bank), he'll get the duplicate
Lore item message and his quest pieces will poof.

If you're wanting another one for a twink, give the one
you have NOW to the twink.  If you're wanting an extra to
sell, sell the one you're wearing NOW.  You won't be without
for too long, simply finish the quest AGAIN after the other
one is no longer yours.
