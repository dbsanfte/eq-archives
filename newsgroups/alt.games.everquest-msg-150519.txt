You've *GOT* to love those. This last Saturday, it's announced in guild
chat that one of our 53 Beastlords wants to go do an epic mob he's got
in Permafrost. I know absolutely zilch about the BL epic, but I
volunteer to port folks and come help. Something about a fight in the
bear pits, or whathaveyou.  So we get up there, get the whole raid force
down to the King room, clear out the giants, pull all the way to Vox's
lair, clear everything out and tell the BL, "Ok. Let's rock. Where's
your quest mob?"

BL says, "I was just wondering that myself? The ranger says there's no
mob by that name on track. She should be right around here."

You didn't check first before you rounded up two full groups of 55-60
level players and dragged their asses all the way to Permafrost????

I ported my group out and went off to grind.

/sigh
