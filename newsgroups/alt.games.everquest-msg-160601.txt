Been there, did up to level 2, but was over a year ago.  Our guild now has 
quite a few players in the 30s and 40, so I'm going to organize a raid 
there.

Has anything changed in TOFS in the last year?  A google search didn't come 
up with anything recent.

What about the keys?  Do they go on the keyring or something, now?  Is this 
keyring thingy soulbound ( ie. will I have the key if I die )?
