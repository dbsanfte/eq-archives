Yes, in fact several of the regular residents of the Crafting chat channel 
were EQ spoiler site regulars, like Niami Denmother from EQTraders. I'm sure 
she'll have a full and complete database up very soon if it's not up 
already, she was pretty advanced.

Yep, alt-Enter also toggles window mode.

Tons of stuff drops all the time, it's no different here than EQLive, but 
come to think of it, a lot more of it stacks now. Also, another nice 
innovation is a high number of quest objects that can be examined and 
disposed of in the process. Let's say you find a chipped shard of 
conjuration. You examine it and you find that it's part of a Collection 
quest. You are prompted to add it to your Collection and you choose to do 
so. Poof! It disappears from your inventory and your quest journal now shows 
that you've collected a chipped shard of conjuration.

I haven't seen any description of servers yet other than Beta1 through 
Beta21. As always, I will probably be playing on the RP server if one is 
designated such by SOE and if not then on the player designated RP. Hope to 
see you there!
