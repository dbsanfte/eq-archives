In a few more levels, my necro will get a spell that allows him to charm
undead mobs. (I am sooooooo jonesing to charm something.) But there's
one very basic question that doesn't seem to be addressed in the spell
description.  The game seems very, very intent on this silly rule that
says you can only have one pet at a time.
  Does the charmed mob count as a "pet"? And if so, do I take this to
mean that you can't charm mobs when you've already got old Gabn cast and
ready to rumble?
  I mean, on the one hand, I can certainly see how VI wouldn't want me
running around with two pets at or slightly above my level, ready to
gang up on any hapless single mob I see, so I'm guessing the answer is
that I can't.
  But on the other hand, my true pet remains loyal to the death. A
charmed mob is only loyal for a certain amount of time, and then the
spell wears off. At that point, it seems like I would be left petless
with an extremely angry mob of my level who's suddenly very eager to
come discuss my recent rude behaviour with him.  This doesn't sound
conducive to Necro longevity. What's the deal with this charm stuff?
