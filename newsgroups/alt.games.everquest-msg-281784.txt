Interesting way to break into Time.  I actually suggested that to a guild on
my server.  They had about 45 active raiders and 20-something flags (with a
couple bots) and I thought they had a pretty good chance of being able to
make it to P3 and key up that way.  They chose to bulk up some first and
take the gods which they eventually did.

I will say that Rodcet Nife was never known for open raiding that I was
aware of, which might have made that a more difficult prospect for them.
