Well, 'chanters can require a donation for their services.  A wizard can 
demand payment for traveling to a zone that takes too long to run to.  
Why can't a cleric sak, require, demand compensation for Temp, et al?  
Why not require a donation for a rez?  Most clerics I've come across have 
either ACCEPTED (but not required) a donation for a rez, or flat out 
refused to accept ANY payent.  Doesn't seem like they are taking me for 
granted!

On a personal note, I *LOVE* clerics!  I wnat one in every group I'm in!  
Honest!  And if a 'dot drops off a mob, I say "Let <my favorite cleric> 
have the 'Dot...she keeps you from getting dead and she needs 'em"

(Then again, I also want a 'chanter in my groups, too!)

Well, that's all I got to say, except that If the FV players hate clerics 
so much, why don't they try to go a week without them?  Bet the stroy 
would change then, eh?
