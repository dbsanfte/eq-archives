Crushbone orcs only give you a hit against Indigo Brotherhood, the
Neriak warrior guild. None of the Neriak guards are on this (they're
dreadguard), so you are reasonably safe provided you avoid the warrior
guild and any NPCs on that faction. There's one in the bar in the
foreign quarter, for example, but he won't aggro if you're high enough
level. The regular factions (guards, merchants etc) can be raised by
doing the red wine quest in the library.
