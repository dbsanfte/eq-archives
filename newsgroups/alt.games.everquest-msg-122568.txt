Your 900mhz is right at the edge. Most of the current video cards need
at least a 1ghz processor behind them to perfrom well. I think you can
get by with a newer video card with 64-128mb of memory. You will still
see slow downs in zones like Shar Vahl and the Bazaar with all Luclin
models enabled.

I would recommend...
GeForce 3 Ti200 64mb DDR
GeForce 4 Ti4200 64 or 128mb DDR memory
Radeon 8500/8500LE 64 or 128mb DDR memory

Do NOT buy a GeForce MX card. The newer GF4MX cards are only
marginally better than your current GF2.
