Strangely enough because those cards chosen give them something
approaching a worldwide cover...Other banks in other countries have bought
into the credit card collective so they like oil etc are now
mutlinationals....

For covering as many people as possible without getting into very very
expensive local banking optios (to cover such common things as say Switch
debit cards in the UK) it seems a semsible collection of cards.

Economic business decision not selecting yer players deliberately is what
that smacks of.
