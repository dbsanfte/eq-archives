I actually went and uninstalled the updated textures yesterday.  Not due to
any performance issues, I'm not even sure they would impact performance, but
because I zoned into Blackburrow and the alien skeleton on the wall was
missing.  I didn't notice most of the other changes, and the one I really
did notice was a "bad" change, so out they go.  :)

There are plenty of lower level Luclin zones, though.  So if variety is
worth it to you (it is me) then it's a worthwhile upgrade.

I haven't checked after uninstalling the new textures, but one thing I did
notice after installing Luclin was that transparent stuff is *much* harder
to see now.  Things like the ghosts in Karnors and Howling Stones are
particularly annoying to fight because half the time all you can see is the
name floating in the air.
