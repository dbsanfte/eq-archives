That doesn't appear to be how it works. I got an AA for one flag that
wasn't freed up, Tactics. I had 4 flags total PoV/S, BoT, CoD, Tactics
and got 4aa. 

I'm not sure if PoNb is a different zone from Torment but I heard a
friend of mine say that they didn't appear to get a flag from the
Hedge quest.
