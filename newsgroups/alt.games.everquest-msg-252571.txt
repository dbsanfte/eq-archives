I think that a court would have to rule that if the transaction were
entirely in game (plats for items) then they would consider it 'outside of
the courts jurisdiction'.  IOW an american court has no jurisdiction in
Norrath.  However when a transaction becomes $'s for items then the court
does have jurisdiction.
