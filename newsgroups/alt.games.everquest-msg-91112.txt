Now Dan - even you have to admit the core attitude of this entire newsgroup
is built around "if you don't like it: fuck off" mentality.

Same weiners, as in same type of weiners. I am not anal enough to research
drivel posted in a NG, I hardly even take notice of who is posting what. You
have some people who never see the forest for the trees, I can't be bothered
with the trees as it is only the forest that is important to me. Most of
this particular forest is only fit for woodchipping anyhow, and as much as
it would deflate a lot of egos, who really gives a crapola who you/me/we are
anyhow?

Aww Dan - don't go spoiling my warm fuzzy feeling now - I am having too much
fun. Let me just go back and read a few more "Everyone is jealous of us"
posts to cap off a wonderful day. Don't get me wrong, Dan, I am not patting
my own back, I am just laughing at other wieners for a change. Terribly
sorry if you seem to have taken personal offence at that  ; )

I wouldn't swap with anyone - 2 day downtimes is a very small price to pay
for averaging sub 800 server pops and entire zones to myself quite
regularily.
