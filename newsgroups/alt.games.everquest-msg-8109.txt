 I'd recommened the Field of Bone next to the Kaesora entrance. This is
a good spot as it's safe for anyone and not too far of a run to VP if
you need to run back. Such as when you're fighting a dragon away from
his spawn point and he gets off a gate and starts summoning. Plus it's a
short few steps to inside Kaesora where you can get an evac to Skyfire
if you happen to have someone porting. All in all it's a very convenient
staging spot for Veeshans Peak raids.
