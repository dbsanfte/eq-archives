My cleric has had some small sessions of PL'ing, mostly due to the fact I'm
trying to catch up to friends who want me to be able to group with them, but
for the most part, my characters get all their xp on their own. Even the
cleric has gotten most of his xp by himself. However, the times he does get
PL'd, I make sure his skills keep up with his level, or at least a close
approximation. Nothing worse than having a totally PL'd lvl 39 cleric who
can't cast a heal to save his (or someone else's) life. Or worse, who
doesn't know when to cast that heal, even if his skill levels allow for it.

Starting to think I'm becoming too verbose on this NG. :) I usually prefer
just to shut up and 'listen' rather than 'talk'. :P
