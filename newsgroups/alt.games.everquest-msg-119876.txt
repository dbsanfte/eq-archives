Actually, the *only* deceit involved is someone saying they're
"porting for donations" when they're actually "porting for no less
than this."

Yeah, it is.   So people who want to port for a certain amount should
say so.   Why don't they?   Easy:  they want a minimum amount and
as much more as they can get.   That's greed;  something they should
have told you about in kindergarten as well.

Again, there's *zero* difference between this and the "make an offer"
people who /auction that people complain about.   They won't sell
below the going rate and they're hoping you're overpay.   It's the
same thing here.    "Porting for donations" as you're suggesting it
works is functionally the same as "Porting - make me an offer."
