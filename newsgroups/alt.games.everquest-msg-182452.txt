The highlights (with some comments):

Druids get a new 425 point heal at 44.  I think they needed this.  300 
points through the 40s is pretty weak.  *puts duct tape over all the 
clerics' whining mouths*

Clerics get a new AC/HP buff at 44.

BSTs get a new DoT at 44 and pet buff at 52.  They can also apparently be 
dark elves now!  (check screenshots)

Enchanters got a lame ultravision/see invis/EB buff (wtf?  where's scaled 
wolf?), and a new mana tap over time.  Short duration (10 ticks) on it, 
long recast.  But it's FT50, so can't _really_ argue with it.

Mages got a HoT for the pet.  And a new pet buff.

Necros got a group lifetap over time.  Sounds kinda interesting.  And a 
new FD spell.

Pallies got a new HoT and a new 410 point heal.

Rangers got a new DoT and DD.  DD is a nice upgrade to firestrike, cold 
based, which will give us a little more versatility.  The DoT looks 
pretty craptastic.

SKs got a new DoT and FD.

Shapeople got an interesting new HoT at 44:
Heals 160 hit points every 6 seconds (24 second duration) 
-30% attack speed 
Decreases movement by 100%

Wizards got a see invis/infravision buff at 44, and a new 600 point cold 
nuke at 52.

All the priest classes also got a new Cure Poison/Disease spell at 52.
