No im sorry but your totally wrong here.  Rogues outdamage monks period.
At the very high end, rangers will outdamage monks with sustainable damage,
with a good chance of outdamaging rogues "on occasion" (using TS, mob away
from any walls, clear LOS for arrows etc)

Says who?  (slight ammendment to your comment here) Says the guy who takes
the damage AND heals others taking the damage, or the guy healing the
damage?

I've been group cleric on second floor SSRA while a guild warrior tanked the
elites for a 6-7 hour camp

I've tanked second floor god knows how many times (I've "tanked" the stuff
with my shaman on bad slow agro etc), I've tanked all the taskmasters in the
basement

I tanked a mob in sleepers tomb last night, I always had the cleric on my
second computer, and healed the warriors tanking ST stuff last night

NEWSFLASH!!!!  A monk, me, can tank better than a 60 WARRIOR (who dinged 60
yesterday, is in indi or whatever the poh warrior armour is).. well no
fuckin shit, sherlock!

"Now I add that a very well equipped monk will have as many HP as an average
equipped warrior"

A very well equipped monk will also outdamage an average rogue.. a very well
equipped paladin will outdamage an average equipped warrior

I really see no point in the comment you said.  The reason I can tank better
than joe bloggs warrior is because I have 138 AA levels increasing my
characters power, because I raid every single day, because I've been raiding
for a long long time, because I know shit about the game in general, because
I bust my ass off with insanely tough boring faction quests (chardok, ally
to tormax when you kill statue/vindi/aow/tormax every week)

Dont compare my monk to the average warrior who does nothing to better
himself and let that be the basis for.. "well monks tank better than
warriors, they need nerfing" because thats BS

Compare me to a similar /played warrior in my (any for that matter) guild,
compare me to a player who works their ass off getting AA and faction to do
quests for upgrades.

 If you wanna compare some shitty geared warlord with 25 days /played, then
go look on monkly-bus for a monk who isnt in an uber guild, a monk who wears
drake hide legs and a shitty shroud on his face, who wears a froglok crown,
who wears at best a dragon tooth choker on their neck

Why would using any other heal be more efficient than a cheal?
I've healed a lot of warriors, and myself a lot, and even on my shitty HP
monk I find cheal is by far the most effective heal

LOL.   Sorry to break it but a rogue has similar defence skills to a warrior
and similar HP to a monk.
Lets dispell one myth right away, like for like, a rogue SIGNIFICANTLY
outdamages a monk, end of story.

As for taking damage like a wizard...  I've seen a rogue tank HoT, tank a ST
warder (dragon), various mobs in Ssra, and regular exp haunts like seb, velk

My guild rangers can tank ssra mobs, they can solo velks, that again is bs

No, doing NOTICABLY less damage

a bard and cleric should tank better than a monk?   /boggle
