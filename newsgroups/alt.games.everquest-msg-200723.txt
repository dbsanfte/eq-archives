Dear all,

I'm a student studying at University of washington in Seattle. I'm
currently doing a research paper on how MMORPGs (massively multi
online role playing games) help people to construct their own self
through support, care and love that they get from one of these games.
My special interest is focusing how MMORPGs give support inside the
gay, lesbians and bisexual circle.

My target group are all gay, lesbian and bisexual who plays MMORPGs
such as Everquest, Sims Online, the Dark ages of Camelot and
text-based MUD or any other MMORPGs.

here's the link to my survey, and it would be grateful if you can
spare a few minutes filling one in...

**All information will be stictly confidential**
many many many thanks =)

Regards
Prudyeq
