Tell ya what..

When you are ready to act like an adult and debate w/o resorting to
personal attacks, come talk to me..

You have bragged about your supposed prodigy children and all that
crap yet, you change your position at the drop of a dime..

When you are ready to act like an adult, rather than an intolerant
little braggart, I'll be here to debate issues..

Excellence is the result of caring more then others think is wise,
risking more then others think is safe, dreaming more then others
think is practical and expecting more then others think is possible.
