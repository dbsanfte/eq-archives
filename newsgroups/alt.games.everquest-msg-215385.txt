On my server, I buy some of ths a lot. There are precious few mages with
the Muzzle of Marduk spell, so when I settle down for an evening's
adventuring, I will buy a half dozen muzzles in the bazaar for about 10p
each. I can't find any mages reliably who have the spell, so it's the
only way to get item haste for my pet.

I can't see it being a scam, it's not like they can HIDE the no-rent
tage or anything. :)
