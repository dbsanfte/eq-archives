Don't have a reply for this part?  LOL

Couldn't come up with anything better than the old "I'll pick on your
typos" bit?   Ironic is a sentence including the word "lame".

That was not what I said.  Learn to read.

> Don't blame me when your own words show you for what you are..

I'm not all worried about my words.  Too bad you can't be bothered to
comment on *my* words, but instead re-word things to say what *you*
want to read.   A few people have pointed this out to you now, maybe
you should take a hint?
