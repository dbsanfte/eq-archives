It came through fine on my end (and probably on most
people's computers), but I know why it looked funny to
you...

You have your newsreader set to interpret posts as
HTML documents (as if they were web pages).  And
since you started your reply with "<big snip>",
it read that as "<big [whatever]>, which is an HTML
command to display the following text in a "big" font.

You should disable HTML interpretation for your
newsreader, since all newsgroup postings are supposed
to be plain text.  I'd like to tell you how, but I don't
know which of a dozen or so newsreaders you might
be using, and the method for changing the settings
is different in all of them.
