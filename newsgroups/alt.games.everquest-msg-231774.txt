I had exactly the same thing happen to me, the game crashed after the
server select screen, apparently just before the character select
screen would display.

Im my EQClient.ini there was a line UISkin=Someskin I dont know how I
set it up to use the skin by default, but there you go.

Changing the line back to UISkin=Default fixed the problem for me.
Hope this helps.
