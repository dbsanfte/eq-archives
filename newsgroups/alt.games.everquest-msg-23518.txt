Not really.  Sullon is a grief players dream heh.  Zone camping and
corpse camping are accepted practices and occur frequently.  I see the
force of numbers, backed up by full PvP, as the best way for roleplayers
to control grief play, rather than just a strict rule set, just as those
dedicated to purely ooc PKing control Sullon now.  

The environment should be such that those who are antisocial misfits are
weeded out via social darwinism.  Small things can make a big
difference, like perhaps having no vendors stocking food.  The only way
to get food is to purchase it from player/bakers, so the grief player
either has to spend his time baking (ya right hehe) or he suffers when
the bakers learn of his reputation and refuse to sell to him.  Does this
also crimp those who just want to solo fight for phat exp?  Yup, but
there's lots of servers for them to do that on already, we are talking
about a roleplaying server here.  Apply that same concept to other areas
of the game and you kill two birds with one stone.  First you annoy the
grief players into leaving the server, second you make a much richer
world where trade skills have more meaning and folks have to depend on
one another for survival, just like real communities.  I think I'd toss
in some severe restrictions  on trade skills so that you couldn't just
learn them all yourself.  And.. and... and...  hehe ok, I'll shut up
now.
