Not nearly as much more complicated as you believe.  Lokari's point
is more than valid.  Or have you been ignoring all the trouble
hi-tech armies have been having fighting 'primitives' over the past
40 years (ask the Russians about Afghanistan).
A couple of key points worth noting:
- the American revolutionaries had help from French military advisors
during the war,
- General Washington did not succeed with glorious victories on the
battle field (the most significant victory by his army was a surprise
raid on an unprepared camp of mercenaries), but rather by preserving
his army in the face of defeat and severe logistical problems,
Neither of the above lessons were lost on the like of Ho Chi Minh.

Sorry, <not> a strawman.  Try again.

I see the leap, but there is no bridge across the void.  How does
your assertion follow from Lokari's?

I'm no fan of the NRA, but I see the value of their 'moderate'
extremism and I wouldn't want to live in a place where they
were repressed or ignored.
