Not really, I spent 40k for Sha's Revenge but only 22.5k for
CoTAM.  If I ever see Sun Vortex for sale, it will cost around
30k.  Rathe's Son is worthless.  I can't even unload the
mage spectral's I've been trying to sell for just a few k
each (including Black Steel and Maelstrom of Ro).  BL Spectrals
run 7-9k.

I can tell you from experience - outfitting a 65 mage to be
very effective in a group is far less expensive than a BL.
