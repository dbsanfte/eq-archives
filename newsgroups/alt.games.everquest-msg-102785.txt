A friend of mine who plays had his main character accidentally deleted (His
son, who is around 5, wanted to use the computer, and EQ was running. Not
knowing how to properly shut down the game, he deleted my friend's character
instead!) The GM was helpful and did, indeed restore his character. As
someone else said here, be courteous, honest and apologetic, and  your
chances of success go up quite a bit.
