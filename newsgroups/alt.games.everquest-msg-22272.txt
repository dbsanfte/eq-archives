I understood that just fine.

So scatter when you see Giants on the horizon, or keep a SoW
on, or get a level 30+ group of dedicated giant killers to
keep the zone clean of Sand Giants.  Or abandon the zone
to the "goods", or have evil Shamans cast SoW on evil newbies
and have them return the favor by training "goods" in the
good-controlled zones.

There are many creative ways to handle this in the planned
anarchy that is SZ.

All part of the fun of a free-for-all server like SZ, in
my view.
