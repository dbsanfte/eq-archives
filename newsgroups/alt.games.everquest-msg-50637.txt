There is no previous level for it to affect. The amount of mana you
have is based upon your current level and int so if you add on items
that give you 100 more int you have 100 more int of mana instantly. It
is why when you are level 50 with 200 int and die and are naked at
full mana, your mana will drop to about half once you loot your corpse
and have 200 int again.

So the additional mana you get from the plus int items must then be
medded up after the items are put on. Of course plus 5 won't be the
difference that plus 100 would be.

Its nothing to do with your previous levels, you are thinking of how
it works incorrectly. Think of it this way, for all practical purposes
when you log on your character was just born at whatever level it is
at with whatever int it has and that is how mana is calculated. It has
nothing to do with your past levels or your int then.
