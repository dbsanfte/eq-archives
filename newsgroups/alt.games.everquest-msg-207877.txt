BLs solo great right up to level 65, so, tossing in a paladin should 
speed up the kills, and reduce med requirements.  Not sure if the BL can 
do better solo or partnered with a paladin though xp wise.  I've duoed my 
shaman with a BL, and it works great.  Until level 65, the BL slow is 
pretty crappy, but, better than none for the BL/Paladin duo.
