 Such at that big chamber room on the way to Drusella. You can go around
but you still have to pass it on the other side. I can't remember but I
think they'll aggro. 

 But if you go anyway and it looks like you're going to die, try making
it to the carpet pit trap. CR is a LOT easier in the basement than it is
in any of the wings. Mainly because unless you have a rogue with you
wou'll have a hard time opening the doors with the keys on your corpse.
Although with SoE (maybe sow/lev will work) you can get to the east door
which isn't locked.
