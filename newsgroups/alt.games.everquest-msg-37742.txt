 Eh well if you just count raw AC then Azure Sleeves still beat Kael
armor. AC11 on Kael arms. Pathetic. Priests' Kael armor almost has
better AC than Monk. I only wear them because the resists and HP are
worth giving up 1 AC. 

 I'm not sure there is any other class out there that skips most Kael
armor pieces because those pieces are viewed as substandard compared to
other things out there. Legs aren't bad. Arms are fairly decent. Feet
aren't great but they used to have an effect (Firefist) that stacked
with epic. Worthless now. Hands? Crown? No thanks. Ah well, saves me the
trouble of farming for gems.
