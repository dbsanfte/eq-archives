I decided to play my 12 high elf enchanter again after several months of not
playing him, only using him for the Stein of Mogguk quest when one of my
other characters needed some  PP.

I soloed him from 12 to 13 to brush up on my enchanter skill before trying
to group.  Once I hit 13 I got in a good orc highway group in the Oasis, and
hit 14 on the same sitting.  I joined the group, and someone asked "What to
enchanter do?"  I told him they keep multiple pulls manageable.

When I created him I put 20 points in charisma and the rest into
intelligence, I have wondered if that was a good idea, but today I think it
worked out.  On the second pull with 3 mobs, I charmed an orc, and used him
to attack the mob that no one else was one.  After the first two were dead,
everybody was wondering why they couldn't attack the last one.  I was
finally able to convince them that I charmed him and he was my pet.  When he
said "Guarding with my life oh splendid one", they finally started to get
the idea.  All of my charms that weren't outright resisted lasted over 2
minutes, even one that conned yellow.  After about a 1/2 hour of charming
and messing, the person who asked what enchanters do, said that enchanters
rock.

Yes, even before 16, enchanters can be a good addition to a group.  Now if I
can just get that magician to quit using AOE spells after I mez.
