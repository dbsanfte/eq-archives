Hi ALL;

At level 20 I received a spell called Faith Respect.  The description just 
says "forces respect for the cleric".  I've cast this on group members, and 
mobs and all the message says is something like, "this has no effect " or 
similar message.

Could someone please tell me what this spell does and when to use it?

Thank you in advance for your time and help.

Doctorzoid
