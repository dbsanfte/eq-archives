When it was first put on Test I tried it out. I didn't like it because
the chain would fail if you "fizzled" a song which happens a LOT with
bards. I found myself playing wack-o-mole constantly having to restart
the "melody". Far too often it would cause songs to drop because the
"missed note" wouild happen in the middle of the melody and the
restart stats at the top. It was still more efficient (and safer) to
control each song manually.

This was all months ago, so maybe they tweaked it in the mean time.
