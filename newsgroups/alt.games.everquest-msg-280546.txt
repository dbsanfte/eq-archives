Well, I've been giving it a go for the past week or so, and I must say 
that 2-boxing does, in fact, rawk! So far I've tried shadowknight/shaman 
and ranger/cleric duos with equal enjoyment. This is gonna do nothing 
for my alt-oholism. :P

As I had stated, I'm running both instances on one PC but from different 
directories. The only reason I run from different directories is so that 
I can crank down all the graphic settings and turn the sound off on the 
second account.

What really make this work though, for me anyway, is the Nostromo 
SpeedPad n52 game controller from Belkin in conjunction with WinEQ - the 
free version (more on that in a moment). I just set up several crucial 
hotkeys on the second character, then use the n52 to macro the quick 
process of ALT+TAB'ing, hitting the corresponding number key for the 
desired hotkey, and ALT+TAB'ing back. Triggering any process takes 
little more than a couple of seconds.

For example, I have two different HEAL hotkeys set up on the second 
account:

Hotkey 1 - HEAL (to be used from a sitting position - medding)
/pause 3, /target ME
/pause 3, /cast 1
/pause 3, /cast 1
/pause 30, /cast 1
/sit

Hotkey 2 - HEAL 2 (to be used while assisting me in combat)
/pause 3, /target ME
/pause 3, /cast 1
/pause 3, /cast 1
/pause 30, /cast 1
/assist

The n52 is set up to just ALT+TAB, hit the appropriate hotkey number and 
ALT+TAB back. There are some timing issues I'm still working out, such 
as occasionally for some reason the first line of the hotkey doesn't 
fire, causing the heal to land on the mob, but for the most part it 
works very well.

When these characters gain more levels, I should be able to tighten up 
the delays a bit, but for right now they are necessary to account for 
all the fizzles. Also, for the shaman anyway, I'm running short on 
hotkeys, so I'm working on using additional hotkey pages and switching 
back and forth. My primary concern is minimizing the time I need to be 
looking at the screen on the second account, and with 10 pages of 
hotkeys to work with, I think I can manage that. ;)

In addition to heals, I have seperate hotkeys set up on my shaman for 
slow, multiple dots at a time, burst of strength (don't laugh, every 
little bit helps for a non-twink :P) and nuke. I plan to add a buff 
sequence (to include memming the appropriate spell set) and a canni-
dance loop in the future.

The only performance issue I'm having may merely be a graphics driver 
issue, as I noticed anomalies when just playing a single account as 
well. In those cases, primarily in the tutorial, the kobolds were 
displayed as strange wads of polygons on wildly incorrect vectors or 
something, yet I could see the whip they wielded just fine. Often when I 
approached, they would morph into the correct model, or it would change 
depending on the angle at which I viewed them. I upgraded to the latest 
ATI drivers to no avail.

However, when 2-boxing, the primary account (the one on which I 
typically leave the display settings bumped up for some eye candy) will 
occasionally crash. Once this happens, I can restart that instance, but 
it's just a matter of time before the graphics in both instances just go 
to crap in a different manner. Icons (spell gems and such) will become 
corrupted on-screen and there will eventually become a veritable 
lighshow of flickering from the sky and other environmental texture 
areas. The cursor even degrades into a snow-filled square, similar to 
the snowy distortion many other UI elements take on. This continues to 
degrade until I reboot.

I'm using a Radeon 9800 Pro 128MB with a P4/3GHz CPU and 1GB of PC3200 
dual channel DDR RAM, so I wouldn't think it to be a hardware 
limitation. I'm guessing maybe display driver issues.
