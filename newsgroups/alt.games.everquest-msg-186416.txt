    Worse for HPs than a hammered golden loop. Worse than a Solstice
Earring, so not many people should be interested in it period. I can see
someone that didn't have the cash to get one of the "real" earrings (like
Mosquito Leg, or a Loop) going in on this, but nobody else.

    The item you've used as an example isn't much of an upgrade for most
people. The person who did take it got a marginal upgrade over the bare
minimum they'd have in the slot, electrum black sapphire. Let me use a more
concrete example, so you can see what I mean:

    New ranger joins your guild. Like most rangers at the level of one of
your recruits, he's locked into offhand haste. So if he wants to upgrade his
offhand DPS, he first needs to snag a haste item. Look at the haste items
that drop off mobs you kill - which one do you suppose a new player will be
able to outbid the rest of you on? So how long is our ranger friend going to
be stuck with his current offhand weapon? And remember, he can't upgrade any
of the slots he thinks he can get haste in, or those points will be wasted
when he finally does get the haste item. So he passes on stuff he should be
taking because he dreams of someday owning stuff like the chain tunic off
Cursed, or the Acrylia Handled Broadsword, and he knows that if he pisses
all his points away now on stuff that he will bank when he gets haste he'll
be that much further from what he REALLY wants.

    Joining a guild and seeing that even though you kill those mobs you
always dreamed, you'll never get those cool items you dreamed about is
awful. That's where an officer reward system can be really useful. When I
first joined, one of the first things I got was the Halo off Cazic Thule.
There's no way I'd been in the guild enough time to deserve it, and other
clerics still wanted one, but it was a dream item and really made me happy.
Over the next month or two I got as little loot as you might expect having
got something that great, and the other clerics got the great drops they
deserved so they weren't shafted. But it was something that never would have
happened in a points system.

    And I still have my old hat, the Skull Shaped Barbute, in the bank. ;-)
