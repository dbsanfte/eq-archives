Here's one of the big issues to think about:

How are you going to handle loot distribution? If you've never had to
distribute phat lewts to a hungry guild consider yourself extremely
fortunate.  Loot distribution is probably the #1 reason why people
leave guilds or why guilds break up. [The first guild I ever joined
broke up over the distribution of a jade reaver.]

If you go with an informal approach to loot distribution be prepared
for complaints, accusations of favortism, etc. Choosing a points
systems that rewards players for attending raids is more fair but
requires considerable effort and bookkeeping.

My guild goes with a rotation system: if you are active you are on the
loot distribution list which is broken down by class. When you get
something you drop to the bottom of the list. Big ticket items are
usually distributed independent of the system. This rotation system
works okay and everyone knows where they stand. Unfortunately it does
not penalize people who only show up when they have a chance to get
something.

On Monday night a silk robe dropped in HoT. While the guild was going
ape the reaction in the officers channel was "oh crap". Every caster
wants one, and that was only the third we've gotten in months and
months of pharming HoT. We awarded it to a player then got flamed the
next day by a caster who thought it should have been his.

Being an officer means having very little time to do "your" things,
leading or organizing raids when needed (like making groups for a 50
person raid.... /shudder), handling innumerable tells the second you
log in, dealing with interpersonal or interguild conflicts, making
decisions then dealing with the repercussions or consequences, and
entertaining your guild night after night. Don't expect a whole lot of
appreciation for your efforts; it is truly a thankless job.
