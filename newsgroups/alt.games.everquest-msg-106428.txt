	Luclin mobs, by and large, are less difficult than Velious ones, and may
not be more difficult than Kunark ones.  This is due to the fact that Velious
had no need to support a newbie population, and Luclin does.

|Also look at the drops
|off old world mobs to Kunark mobs to Velious mobs to Luclin mobs to see how
|"what should be dropping at level X, with rarity Y" has increased over time.

	They are all basically dropping the same garbage.  I got a nice Elder
Owlbear Beak off a named in Hollowshade
(http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7839), gave it to a Ranger
friend in her low 20s to practice Piercing with.  A level appropriate group
that got one (and despite what Allakhazam's says, a level 32 group would be
hard pressed to do it) would sell it to someone about that level, because they
have better.

	This behaviour is completely, 100% totally unavoidable if the game is to
include tradeable items without level caps.  They are not improving the drops
because the mobs are tougher.  Velious yard trash in the easy outdoor zones is
tougher than boss encounters in Antonica dungeons, and those mobs drop
complete garbage.  They improved drops in Luclin in a vain attempt to
compensate for the insane item ecomony, and it was the wrong thing to do.
There are only two answers that will work, and one of them (make everything
NoDrop) utterly destroys the economy.  Level caps will ensure that people will
use the items they get when they can get them, and still make it possible for
an economy to exist.  It simply won't be the economy we have, but the economy
we have is a total joke.

|    Now randomly slap a bunch of level limits on the items in game. And it
|is random - level 35 on the axe? Any justification there?

	I'm sure the level limit on the axe fit some mathematical model they're
using for who should have what at what level.  (Whether the model is at all
realistic is another story, of course.)

|    You now have to re-tune a whole bunch of mobs that previously were "just
|right" for people with the assumed level of twinking, since they're now too
|difficult for the reward and will become unused content.

	You don't have to retune anything.  

|    Have you been through any of the "new style" high-end encounters? You
|know, the ones people like Furor whine and moan about?

	Furor whines and moans about everything.

|I always loved the
|basic premise behind raiding: find out if a target is up, assemble folks,
|clear to the target, kill it. No sitting on our asses for hours waiting for
|something other than the PH, just go in and get the fight you wanted in the
|first place. But that meant that players could get through all the world's
|content too fast! They must be slowed down!

	Um, yeah, this is a problem.  Within 24 hours of a server reset everything
is dead.  The only reason it takes that long is that they recently put spawn
delays on everything; before that, within 4-5 hours everything was dead.  Then
you get to wait another week, assuming the servers stay up that long, for it
to respawn.

|    Enter ring events, and quested mob encounters.

	Which are good, within reasonable limits.  They're on crack if they think
a ring encounter that requires 100-200 people is going to work at all, or even
that there is anyone in the game at all interested in trying to find out.

|Then I found out it was one of five rare drops I'd need to activate the big
|ooze, and I went from being excited to feeling cheated. I don't want to kill
|five thousand blue mobs that I know I can kill, I want to fight a massive
|ooze thing that might just kick my ass.

	Instant gratification is bad, in either VR or RL.

|    I'm just waiting for them to combine all the delaying tactics into one
|massive delaying tactic in Planes of Power. Imagine the keyed plane, The
|Absolutely Final Plane of Veeshan, Really. The key to get in requires you to
|get ten pieces, each one on a god in their own plane (maybe - it is just one
|item on the drop table, after all). The gods will, of course, summon every
|critter in the plane to aid them, so you have to clear the plane first.
|Then, to get to the god, you have to go through a ring-style event to
|trigger their spawn. So get keys for everyone that wants to go to the new
|plane, assuming you have max ally faction with the key quest giver. Did we
|mention everyone starts out KOS to the quest giver but can gain faction,
|just like Chardok faction? But wait! Your puny weapons and spells don't work
|in the new plane (this way the plane can be tuned against more reasonable
|spells than Complete Healing, Turgur's Insects and Shock of Frost)! To get
|spells and weapons that can, you need to camp several rare-spawning mobs
|across the game which have a chance of dropping the Flerbium Hilt Mold or
|Rune of Spewtum which you combine with several other rare-drops to get the
|tools you need to fight there. Now you can actually go and challenge
|yourself with fights that require strategy and planning - enjoy!

	Except for the part about having to forge newbie weapons to fight level 70
mobs, I don't have a problem with it.

|of the game easier, which is good. A mixed bag, but not a lost cause. So why
|mess it all up to "fix the economy", when nobody's yet shown why that
|economy is broken or how it detracts from the game more than these changes
|would?

	The economy is broken because it trivilizes all the content in between
level 1 and the low 50s, because no one cares about the items available in
between because they can use the gear the low 50s are throwing them.  If you
played a Ranger, how much would I have to pay you to go quest for a Short
Sword of Morin or an Orc Impaler?  Should we not bother having quests or
dropped items lower than level 50?  Should people get level 50 weapons from
doing level 25 quests or killing level 25 mobs?  Either answer is insane.

	Low and mid-level content has to have a point, and it won't if its rewards
don't matter.  The only way to make the rewards matter is to keep people from
eschewing them in favor of the rewards from high-level content, and the only
way to do that while still preserving the economy in any form is level caps.
