I've seen several people claim that after a wipe the camp is
essentially open.

I disagree.  Of course there is no rulebook we are abiding by.  We all
know the GM's don't even recognize camps.

Key point: The only reason people recognize camps is because they
aren't complete assholes, and because they don't want to earn a bad
reputation.  In my opinion, reinforced by the actions of people in
nearly every wipe I've ever seen, taking a camp after a wipe is wrong.

I always send a tell and ask if they are coming back.  There are
exceptions of course.  If they are wiping over and over again.  If you
only sit on it until they are ready to take over (Ice Giants come to
mind).  But it usually takes time to set up a camp, get a rythm going,
and get the exp or loot rolling in.  A partial or full wipe is bad
enough without some jackass claiming your camp.
