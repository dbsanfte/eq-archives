Many casters have gotten lazy when it comes to watching agro from nukes,
slows and other toys at their disposal that irritate mobs.  Paladins, Shadow
Knights and now Warriors with their agro tools can keep a mob's attention
for the most part.  Being able to tank for more than a few seconds incase
the mob drops the main tank would encourage groups to welcome Monks.  Monks
need to be able to withstand abuse until the group is able to kill the mob
and get their main tank rezzed.  That would go a long way in improving the
class without marginalizing any of the other tanks.  Monks would never be
sought after as main tanks because the class has no tools other than
straight damage that can add hate to a mob.

If Monks are destined to remain paper tanks then add some better grouping
and offensive tools.

How about a targeted mend ability?  They could mend members of their party.
It would be separate from their personal mend ability.  Allow the feet of a
monk to do more than a flying kick ever so often.  What is so good about
being a martial artist if you kick as often as some plate wearing Knight or
Warrior?  Big deal if you do more damage.  As a Martial Artist specialist
your feet should be used almost as often and with similar speed as your
fists.

Add some endurance based attacks.  For example a monk could drop to the
ground and attempt to trip a mob which would have the effect of a stun
against the mob.  Or grab a mob and attempt a throw. Of course there will be
mobs that are too big to do this to and would be immune to it.  Seeing a
caster getting beat up by something and being able to grab the mob and
attempt a throw to get it away from the caster would add a unique tool to a
group.  I am not complaining about the weapons monks get to use.  I just
feel that a line of purely monk based attacks need to be introduced that are
endurance based.  Maybe give monks the ability to try and grab a mob and if
successful then attempt a few other moves like a choke or something.  How
about a knockdown that if successful would be like a stun for a certain
amount of time.  There are possibilities that could be done to improve the
class and make it once again a fun class to play.  Unfortunately, the game
is so based on a melees standing toe to toe with a mob and using weapons in
its primary and secondary slots that I seriously doubt anything innovative
will come from the developers.
