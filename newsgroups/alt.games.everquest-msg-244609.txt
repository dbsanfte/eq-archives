The level of dungeons goes as follows:

20
25
30
35
40
45
50
55
60
65
65 hard

That is it, those are all the choices that exist, anything else would 
require serious rework.

When you select a hard, if you are not averaging 63+ in the group, then 
it just selects the next higher dungeon level.

So, level 20 hard is the same as a level 25 dungeon.  The only hard that 
has a special setup is 65 hard.
