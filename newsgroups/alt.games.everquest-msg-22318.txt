    People with Primal weapons report that once Avatar has procced, it
continues to proc like mad on them. Avatar is a 100 DEX buff. Hmmm.

    Don't get me wrong - I am a disciple of the temple of AC. But I've had
the same experience Dan has - got a solid DEX buff from a shaman in his
40's, and my SK's Vampiric Embrace proc rate went from once every other mob
to twice per mob. I've SEEN the effect he's describing. Some stats have
known "crossover points", like AGI at 75. Is it not possible that DEX has
such a crossover point, at a higher level?

    As for general stat buffs meaning something - two things on that. One,
some stats have measurable effects. Give a good STR buff to my rogue and her
non-minimum modal damage changes. Since she isn't normally hitting for min
damage, that means my average damage has increased. People using high delay
weapons, like two-handed weapons, have also reported the same effect. Since
backstab is on a high delay, this is possibly a general property of high
delay weaponry. But nobody to my knowledge has run conclusive testing on
high delay weaponry due to the length of time to get a proper sample size,
nobody knows for sure.

    Two, and this is the important point, SO WHAT if he asks for Dex?
Really, how big is the efficiency hit to a group to give the buffs to a
group and make them happy, and how big is the hit if they start being
dysfunctional because they're unhappy? As a cleric, I see how people behave
when happy or unhappy, because I have to manipulate emotions to get a group
to do things. "No mana to heal, pull and die." "We're good, it's going to
die, I have you." If a measly DEX buff is all it takes for a paladin to
believe he's a damage machine, and thus make him more likely to stand his
ground when the going gets tough, then it's well worth it.
