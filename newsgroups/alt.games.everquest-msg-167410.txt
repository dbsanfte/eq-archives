I got stuck here too, it almost made me leave EQ until I realized I needed
to change they way I was thinking about EQ.

As a 51war I couldn't solo (not since L40 i think), no one wanted me, guild
was still growing, hard to get around (no nexus or pop), and my EQ friends
all but disappeared.

Probelm is after 50, everyone really wants 55+, so 51-55 have been a bitch
for me too.  I went to KC for those 4 levels and am now in PoT or seb
looking for pick-ups most of the time.

Find a better guild to help support you in these lean times, you'll come
around, and so will they.

Just realize that EQ changes, and so must how you are thinking about it and
playing it.

Hang in there!
