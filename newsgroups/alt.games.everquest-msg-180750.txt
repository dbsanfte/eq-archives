I finally got around to posting my profile on Magelo.

http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=587288

So anything I can upgrade relatively painlessly?  I prefer effect items
that are usefull such as my choker - any spells I don't have to mem ever
the better.  I'm looking for some flowing thought, mana preservation,
reagent preservation focus items.  After that it's HP & AC items, but
I'd like to keep my int and cha at near this level, so no downgrading
those unless I get some serious upgrade somewhere else.

I prefer going out and getting my own stuff, but probably can't get
togeather more than a typical pickup group. If there's something that's
a major upgrade I can get for under 1k I'll go for it, even if it's as
much as 3k and a really major upgrade.

Thanks for any help.
