Very good.  You just described using the Taunt when you need it, i.e.
when the mob hates somebody else _more_ than when it hates you.  Now,
during melee it gets a little more complicated because the mob isn't
just standing there waiting for you to wake it up.  If it decides that
it hates somebody else enough more than you to overcome proximity
modifiers it will go after (or summon) that unfortunate.  That's why
you don't just mash the Taunt button during melee, instead you watch
for slow to land and Taunt then, you watch for a big heal to land on
you and Taunt then.  The reason you wait is that, as far as we can tell,
a successful Taunt raises the mob's hate for you above its hate for
whoever is at the top of the list.  So if Cleric09 CHeals you and goes
to the top of the list, but is far enough away and not sitting so that
the proximity modifer allows you to keep agro, your successful Taunt
will raise your "hate" above hers, hopefully allowing her to not get
summoned when she casts that next CHeal.  Same applies for anything
the casters are doing that generates lots of agro.  And this saving
of Taunt for when you need it applies even more forcefully when, for
example, the mob goes after the Shaman trying to slow it, because if
you can't taunt for the next 6 seconds your Shaman may well be Ranger
gating instead of trying again to land a slow.

<snip KC stuff because...> 

The person you're calling misinformed has long since graduated from KC
to much harder zones.  You might want to be a bit more selective in
your choice of name-calling targets.
