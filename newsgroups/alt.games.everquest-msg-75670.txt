I should rephrase, it is a matter of opinion, not preference.  I like my nec
fine, but as for pure solo ability, the pleasure of solo'in out by yourself
with no one else around, the mage has abilities that are more suited for going
solo on a non pvp server.  The abilities that I previously mentioned make the
mage much more suited to off on their own for extended periods of time.
