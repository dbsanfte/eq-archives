    Hopefully the entry to the zone has been moved someplace where "Joe
Average" can get to it. Right now it's in a place where pretty much only
raid-level characters can get to it, and that kinda defeats the purpose of
it being a funny, goofy place.

    It will be very interesting to see how "gameplay has been improved".
Some of the problems these zones have include the following: no named loot,
named loot that is outdated, pathing issues, low ZEMs compared with PoP
zones, low mob level (not good XP at 65), poor zone-in location, bad
faction, bad combination of mob abilities (eg. clusters of SK-type mobs),
"required classes" (a rogue for HS/CoM, evac for The Hole), and water
combat. Some of those really can't be fixed, so I wonder how these revamps
will work out.

    In other words, when you do a /random nobody can claim that they had
those messages filtered and they need to do a re-roll. Nice options,
especially the pet damage one. Now pet classes can parse themselves very
cleanly.

    Yay, finally! Now where is the melee rebalancing that was promised for
July?

    I wonder if they'll be removing the "unattributed damage" problem that
necessitated the restriction. I'd assume so, but you never know!
