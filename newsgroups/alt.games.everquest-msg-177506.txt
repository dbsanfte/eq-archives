Lucky.  I've been working on the shaman epic for 2 years.  Sadly, I'm in a
very small guild, so we can't get the second to last part (The Hole) done.
I've gone in after it twice with two to three groups (friends of friends and
their friends (best I could muster)) and we would get far enough to get
someone elses epic piece and then everyone would decide they've had enough.
/sigh.  Well, good luck, I hope you get your epic :).  I've been told that 4
fire pets will completely own him.
