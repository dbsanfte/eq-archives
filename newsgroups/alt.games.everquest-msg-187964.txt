My typical pick up group if i am 'chipping' in DL is a shammy, an 
enchanter, a ranger, a monk or rogue tanking and a pure tank [usually a 
warrior but sometimes a pally] and myself. We will chain pull for about 
3 hours or until we cant hold any more drops and KEI gives out. With 
some of the other groups accidently donating adds to us, or legitemate 
adds we have had pulls of 3 to 4 drachids, 1 or 2 drolvargs and the odd 
cockentrice at one time.A few minutes to get a coffee and catch my 
breath, and we are back to chaining again. That is the strength of 
having a dedicated healer and a dedicated buff/debuffer. My game hubby's 
main is a 61 shammy, and his groups always have a dedicated healer. It 
is good to have an alternate healer for a truely horrid pull...but with 
good pullers and good crowd control even what many people would see as a 
bad pull is more hectic that frightening.

Combining a damage shield with a celestial heal can keep most tanks 
topped off with very little trouble even in a busy pull.

{i think we have used the shammy as a drop dead healer twice in the one 
group I frequently find myself in. I have used complete heal about 10 
times since I got the spell.}
