I would most definatly say that an edruite is the best race for echanter,
and troll for warior, wood elf for ranger. high elpf for any white magic
class, dark elf for dark magic, other than enchanter of course, i think
vashire or halfling would make a good rouge, i would also use a high elf for
a bard
