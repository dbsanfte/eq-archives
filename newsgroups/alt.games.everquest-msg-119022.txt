Your server must suck. =/  I'm sorry.

I've been non-anon/role for over 50 levels, and I've never gotten more than
2 port requests a day unless I'm spending a few hours in newbie zones for
whatever reason.

Earlier today I had a bit of fun with a port beggar though while I was in
Lfay:
Him: can u port me to misty thicket please
Me: sure, find me
/who all him
14 noam wizard [akanon]
Him: lol i have to get my corpse in gfay
Me: I'm at that place with stuff
Me: Congratulations
Me: I made a corpse in gfay yesterday, there was something that didn't like
me
Me: or was that lfay?
Me: it kept summoning me a lot
Me: then it killed all my friends
Me: yeah, it was in lfay
Me: I don't like brownies
Him: oh that had to suck
Me: you're not a brownie are you?  I don't like brownies
Him: ok im in lfay
