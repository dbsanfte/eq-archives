I wouldn't worry about trying to "fix" it.  Going from warmly to
amiable is no big deal at all.  I don't think anyone defaults to
warmly to any faction, so some of you other bone chip type quests have
been raising it.  It will balance out.

I woldn't worry about it all, stop at "Indifferent", but by that time
you won't be hanging around Feerot anyways, so its moot.
