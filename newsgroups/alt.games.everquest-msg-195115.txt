I did a quest that involved running back and forth to shadowhaven for
katta faction, back shortly after SOL release.  I don't recall the
details, I think there was a stop in Paladul, or perhaps it was Dawnshroud
or ME... or I'm remembering several quests.  I did do several different
quests back then, repeatedly, building up various factions.  None of the
quests I'm thinking of involved any sort of drop, you asked someone for
something to trigger the quest, then he sent you to someone who sent you
to someone and eventually back to the quest giver, with one or more
faction hits along the way.

Of course I also can't say whether you can do those quests as an ogre...
but these days they've added illusion potions and chanters that can bestow
illusions, along with the wood elf mask.  So it seems to me it might be
altogether simpler to just change your looks and finish the quest you have
in mind that way.

Also, an Iksar monk friend of mine managed to MQ the EB item quest with me
via use of sneak and FD.  Took a couple tries and I had to rez him in
between, but we figured it out eventually.  Not certain this would work
with the Rallic Pack guy, and of course I don't know what race and class
you are anyway, but its something to look into.
