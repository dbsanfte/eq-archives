When I log out from a character I frequently get a stuck cursor.  Solution
has been to alt-enter to put it in windowed mode, then alt R to let me get
the cursor back in the EQ window, then alt-enter again to get back to
regular mode, but with a functioning cursor.

I should have posted about this when it started happening and I found a
solution, it just slipped my mind.  Its -very- annoying.
