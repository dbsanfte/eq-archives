As you level up you will find it harder and harder to stand toe to toe
with monsters around your level.  In order to melee something down you
will begin to find that you have to root, back off, heal, and go back
in.  Toward your 40s and fifties you will find that you cannot stand
toe to toe with most dark blue mobs, at least not very efficiently. 
(Rooting and healing drains the mana pool fast).  At this point your
best option is to fear kite, as othes have already mentioned.  Outdoor
zones with lots of room to kite things around are your best options of
course.  One thing I would recommend is that if you do fearkite, apply
your fear spell liberally.  Its much more mana efficient to recast
fear too often than to let the animal's fear wear off so that it can
smack you a few times.  (Requiring you to heal yourself).

As for how long you can solo, I have solowed at all levels.  In your
fifties you get a regen and some other nice spells.  You may find that
you can once again melee *some* dark blues.  But you will also find
high level animals of all levels.  There are rats in PoDisease that
you can fearkite.  There are Stalkers in PoN.  Velium hounds and
elephants in Western Wastes...all good for some higher level exp. 
Plus, once you get your archery AA's (level 59+), you will be able to
effectively arrow kite a *lot* of things down.  I was arrow kiting
level 61's at level 60...not many "melee" characters can solo anything
that is higher level than them.  Its slow exp, and won't compare to
Enchanter, Necro, Shaman, Beastlord (probably), and probably some
others' solo exp.  But yes, you can solo at pretty much any level.
