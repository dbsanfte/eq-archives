<<<SNIP>>>
""" That's at least one good reason to appreciate a Paladin as
 a tank instead of a Warrior/Monk/Rogue -- we're *very* familiar
 with the casting side of the game, and can accommodate spellcasters'
 needs more intuitively than someone who only plays a manaless tank
 can."""

I may be a manaless tank, but I am VERY aware of the role that mana plays in
a group. Especially when things go wrong, and the casters gate/port, the
rogue hides/sneaks, the monk FDs, and me, the badass warrior, I ... well, I
run for the zone screaming like a lttle girl.

The biggest problem is you have warriors, then you have tanks. Most people
become warriors because it is, in essence, one of the easiest starting off
classes. No spells to go hunt down, no special skills to train (backstab,
feign death), you just go out and as you fight, all your skills go up on
thier own! And little kids especially seem to LOVE being dwarf warriors,
which is why I moved to Freeport the first chance I got.

So you have all these new players, and they are told that being in a group
is the best way to get xp, so they join a group, then are told "you're
pulling". Or, they play main tank, and when the puller stops, they figure
"hell, he must be tired, I'll just take over for a while. I've been watching
him, I know how to do it." Next thing you know, the whistle's blowin and the
lights are flashin ....

I'm not trying to justify anything here, I'm simply saying that most tanks
out there don't know how to tank. Should we take it easy on them? Depends. I
had an instructor once tell me "There's only two reasons why you do
something wrong: either you don't know, or you don't care." If you don't
know what you're doing, I'll help you out. If you don't care, I got two
words for ya......
