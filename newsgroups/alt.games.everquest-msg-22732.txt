HP buffs are dirt cheap, there's no reason -not- to slap them
on everyone in the party.  If you get aggro, we are going to
try to get it off you right away, and your HP total is so tiny that
the HP buff may give us half again the chance to do so.

The HP buffs are least important on the tanks, actually, as they
have the least proportional effect.  Is Resolution really going
to make a difference to a tank who is taking more damage than
the buff gave him, each round?  It will count for a bit if things
get very close (its like a heal in advance) and give me a little
more bang for my CHeal buck, but no big deal.

Put it on the soft targets, though, and there's a much better
chance we don't need to stop, res you, heal you, protect you
while the res effects wear off, wait for you to get mana...

Too, you in particular can't casually be allowed to die, not
only do we lose a nuker who probably isn't OOM, but
we lose one of the tanks...

You aren't getting an AC buff and you probably aren't getting
a symbol either... but the mana only HP buff?  Why the heck
not?
