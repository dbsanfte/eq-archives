Yeah, those are.  Fortunately the AC is on the next island and you
never have to see the Seafuries if you don't want to.   The spawn
there will all be "one-shot" green to a 48 except for the AC and
regular cyclops, which will also be light blue or cyan (high-green.)

Invisibility to Undead won't help if the reanimated hand is up
and that's where the piece spawns.  It's impossible to get in
there, pick up the piece, and not get agro'd while the hand is
alive.   It's also fairly easy to get someone to pull it, though,
since the frenzied ghoul camp is in easy pull range and that
camp is always taken.
