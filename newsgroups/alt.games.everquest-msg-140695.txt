I will likely eventually get a PS2 regardless, as I have a lot of PS1 games
still.  Of course, post EQ, PS-whatever has not been much of an issue, it's
been collecting a lot of dust.  I don't own any DVDs yet, so that has not
been a real priority.  I still own a fair selection of laserdiscs, and I
have a player for those that doubles as a CD player, for now, that suffices.
It is looking like I will have to eventually break down, as VHS is declining
and DVD is rising as the medium of choice.
