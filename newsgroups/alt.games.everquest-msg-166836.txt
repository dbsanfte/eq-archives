I just upgraded my Geforce 2 Pro to the Geforce 4 128m. I wasnt all
that impressed by the performance increase in Everquest. Yes it is
noticeable, but I still lag in bazaar. Outside of bazaar my GF2 hardly
ever lags so I just dont see much of a difference. Certainly not worth
spending that kind of money. Especially since all these cards are
about to drop in price. I know its your parents money. but you should
realize you can get more for that money if you are patient.
