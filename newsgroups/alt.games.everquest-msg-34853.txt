LOL...You just proved the rule...There are always two sides to every
argument. When it comes to coming up with a unique name or a common one that
suits your personality or the personality you want to act out in the game,
I'm glad that VI gives a little leeway to names. I've had more than one
person in game tell me they would petition my name but every guide or GM
that responded and questioned me decided in my favor. I play my mage in a
mostly role-playing mode. I love to duel with him now that I'm up over 24.
I'm making mince meat out of rouges, warriors, and shadow knights. For some
reason pally's give me a little trouble if I fizzle more than once and they
Lay Hands before I complete the nuke fest on them. And before everyone
starts jumping in a saying their character would wipe the floor with me, my
duel record against players within 3 levels higher or lower than me is 37
wins to 7 losses. Fizzles are what kill me, not your resist gear and high
hit points. My pet only has to stun you once or twice and you are dead. As
long as I am 3/4 way into my cast it will hit even if interrupted by your
hit. And yes, fellow mages, that fire shield helps a lot. Flame away but my
experience tells me differently. I still haven't beat a necro or druid and
it is driving me nuts....
