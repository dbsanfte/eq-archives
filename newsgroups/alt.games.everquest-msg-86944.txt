No, you all still have to connect to the internet, and pay for each account
that is in use to play Everquest, on whichever server(s) you have chosen to
play.   His idea is just to all play Everquest together.  So, it is not at
all what you are looking for.  I am not aware of any such game, but then, I
am too busy playing Everquest to look into other games.
