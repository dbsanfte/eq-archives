Look up Aliani or Gerrymander sometime (my main and
alt rogues on E. Marr) if you have any ingame roguish
questions!

No, and on E. Marr Befallen is back to undead and necros only.
The DE invasion is over.  NOTHING in the zone sees through
sneak/hide, although if this is a level appropriate raid remember
that mobs that are close to and higher level than you always have
a _chance_ to see through the skills, reguardless of having an
actual "See Invisible" spell cast on them by another NPC.

WT main, TC off.  Not enough of a damage bonus to make TC
main worthwhile at Befallen-raid levels, and the TC is great for
getting DW skill up.  I'd start questing for a Burning Rapier when
you get the time and a couple of more levels, too.  My CR gear
includes the BR main and a EBW off-hand, which is a lot of
fun to poke things with...

No.  And the hand-made backpack market has fallen some since
the guy sells trader's satchels in the Bazaar now.  Sure they're
heavy, but the bank has no encumbrance level...
