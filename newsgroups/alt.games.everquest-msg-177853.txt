    When we were the only guild keyed for VT on my server, it was the last
place you *could* go. As soon as PoP came out, we all but abandoned it -
went back maybe twice total on days when we had lowish numbers online for
highish PoP stuff. It's a weird mentality to deal with - we've killed Rallos
Zek three times and already people in guild want to stop killing him and
focus on elemental planes stuff. Can you imagine only doing Emperor three
times, or Cursed?

    We got a much more even distribution of loot off him than that, close to
three of each. Less than that of ranger claws and Goldenrods, though. We
also had a very long period where we were the only guild capable of killing
him on the server (the rest didn't have very good strategies), so we got
more kills on him than we're used to.
