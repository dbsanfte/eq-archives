Oh c'mon.  It's not necessary to hate Limbaugh to notice that, like
any other populist, he's far more interested in "true believer"-type
followers ("dittoheads") than thoughtful criticism.  As to his "track
record", I could never get past his constant disparagement of those
who hold differring opinions to notice if there's any actual substance
behind his hateful bluster.

That's not what he said.  But then you already know that, don't you?
An equivalent over-generalization, based on this one post of yours as
you based yours on one post of newshound's, would be:
So much for thoughtful conservatism.

Three conservative imperial dictatorships, one of which was destroyed
and the other two of which morphed into conservative imperialist
oligarchies.  All of which bear striking similarities to historical
feudal systems (especially China, where the descendants of warlords
still hold power in some places).

I do hope that this is a misunderstanding and you are intending to
cheer for capitalism (an economic system, not a form of government,
btw) and not feudalism (which is what newshound was referring to).
You have never struck me as a royalist in any prior posts.
