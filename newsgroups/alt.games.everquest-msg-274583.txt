    Oh nos, all six people that are in DL during prime time will be 
inconvenienced!

    By the way, in case anyone cares - the war is very exploitable. Train 
one side's troops onto the other side, then do at least one point of damage 
to any mob you want to loot. The corpses won't poof when killed by the other 
NPCs that way, and after two minutes you can loot them. There's some OK 
stuff dropping, too - 15 ATK aug, caster wand with Rend proc, lots of nifty 
80ish HP/MANA attunable gear.
