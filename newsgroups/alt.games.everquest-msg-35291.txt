It sure seems like a viable option in a group, although I just saw
a problem with it in a raid... if some of your party members get
higher level cleric buffs, then they are immune to your buff heal...
just like the old days with center as a heal.

Still, assuming you are -the- cleric, then the only heal more
efficient in terms of HP per mana spent would be CHeal... aways
assuming that everyone including yourself is hurt enough to eat the
full value of the heal.

Why just dragons?  I'd think -any- AE situation.  I've sure found it handy
in Seb, where wizard mobs can chunk down everyone by a few hundred
points just by slipping one by the mobs

Group heals aren't really for the tanks, they are absorbing main damage
and the little bobble that a few hundred points here and there provide
is hardly noticable.  They get Cheal when needed, unless its an emergency
where remedy is the only hope of keeping them alive till the mob cluster
is mezed and the main mob is slowed, or near fights end when the've
taken so little that a celestial will put them back near full for the next pull.

However, if your group includes rangers, monks, druids, shamans,
rogues, wizards, mages, necros, and/or chanters, and they (and you)
are all taking some damage (but aren't the main focus of the fight), then
group heal can be a time and mana effective substitute for casting
five remedies or celestials in a row.  The fact that you are also dumping
a few hundred points into the warrior won't let you off the hook for
that next CHeal, of course, but its better than a kick in the teeth.

I WISH, right click Word of Healing.  The Coldain quest legs have right click
Word of Health... just the piddly little hundred pointer.

Nonetheless, thats a hundred points each, every click, free, if (and note
I said if) I'm FM or forced to stand but don't need to cast anything.

I would certainly not use it in an effort to save anyone, by the time
you are capable of getting the legs, a hundred points is less than one
hit from most mobs you face.

No, the effect is more like superbard singing healsong.  100, 100, 100
100 duck cast remedy on someone 100 100 100 duck cast CHeal
on someone 100 100 100... it really adds up, even if only one or two
people in the party are getting hurt.  This series would be up to a thousand
points of healing per party member, free.

The key is to remember that in most circumstances you would be
better off medding up mana for real heals... but if you get a rythm
going with the legs, you may find yourself FM a lot more often,
so that medding won't do anything for you.

Another key is the fact that you can duck to cancel the cast.  Without
this, yes, the legs would be unusable, since you never know when
the chanter might get aggro, and the time from "gets aggro" to "needs
res" is far to short on a chanter to allow waiting for legs to go off
before slapping a remedy on.

In case you got my story mixed up, the chanter didn't die with me
trying to click legs to save him.  I was casting word of vigor,
and the 590 point heal would have done the job.  Also, my
judgement as to whether I had time to cast that instead of needing
to go with remedy was correct... it went off before he died,
and I in fact had time to -start- remedy, just not to get it off.
Range though... well, chanters have a tendency to flit back and
forth trying to keep mobs mezed.

My other fear, that chaining the legs would end up with me
gettting aggro, seems to be unjustified.  Perhaps because each
instance is at best a 600 point heal, and the spell itself is only
a level 34 one... at any rate, with normal aggro management
techniques I noticed no change in me getting the love, and
even agressively -trying- to "taunt" the mob off the FDing
puller, I only saw aggro once... Brell's Empty Mug!, I'd have
been first substitute more often sitting!

PS If I keep up chain clicking the legs, I think I might pick
up a mandolin.  It -really- looks like there's a bard casting
on my group!
