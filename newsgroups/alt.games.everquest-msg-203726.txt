Tim Deep (at least on Quellious) seems to be link-dead city.  It has
happened to me at least twice.  And I've heard the same from others.

Anyways, it's pretty ugly going LD there because there's no real easy
way to get a cleric to come out there and also if you're running when
you go LD, you'll still die and you'll be in the ocean.
