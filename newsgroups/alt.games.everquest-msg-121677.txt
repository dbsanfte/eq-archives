Now *that's* a laugh.

Lessee, The Hidden Fortress, Ran, The Seven Samurai, Kagemusha.  Those
are the ones I think of automatically.  I'd have to use IMDB to check
other films.

If I saw the name, I'd recognize it immediately.  The Akira / Anime
reference wouldn't even occur to me.

Hidden Fortress - Lucas credited it with the basis of Star Wars.

The Seven Samurai - you've probably seen the remake, a little thing
called "The Magnificent Seven".

Ran - a wondrous remake of King Lear.  If you've never seen it, you
*really* should.

Kagemusha - if you want to have fun, watch this, and then read
Heinlein's Double Star.
