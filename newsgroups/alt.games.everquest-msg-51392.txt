If anybody thinks I would do the Burning Rapier for the third
time, they're insane.

Actually, BR and RB are two of the most fun quests I've
ever done, including some of the Velious ones.  The only
beef I had at any point of my rogues' careers (post Kunark,
that is...many beefs before Kunark ;-)  ) was that damn
Gnoll Brewer/Master Brewer.  But then I think about the
rangers who needed 3 of the damn things for a crappy
reward, and shut my mouth.
