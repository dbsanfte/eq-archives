"Cloak of the Black Wind. This item gives 41% haste. This will be your
primary back item all the way into 60s. It also give very nice statistics.
The price of this items varies a lot on server. I saw it from 10k to 80kpps.
Keep an eye on them on your server." from sample page

After reading your "sample page" I have a question... how do you buy a NO
DROP  VT haste cloak from anyone?  Also what do you mean by "This will be
your primary back item all the way into 60s."? Sounds like going into VT is
easy for those under 60 since you can use this cloak all the way to 60.
*grins*

if you can answer these two for me I will ignore all other mistake in your
sample page and buy one *grins*
