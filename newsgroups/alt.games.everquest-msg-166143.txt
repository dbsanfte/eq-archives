Can't recall your other post, but if you aren't determined to solo
you might check out old-world dungeons (Lower Guk, SolA, SolB) for
group possibilities.  The old-world mobs tend to have significantly
lower HP than similar leveled mobs in the various expansions (so you
can more easily impress others with the AmazingDestructivePower(tm)
of your nukes), while afaik those dungeons still have decent ZEMs.
And that snare of yours that lets you kite outdoors will be useful
to help prevent runners from starting trains in a group that lacks
another snarer.
