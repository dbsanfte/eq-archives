Bards have the most powerful movement rate buffs, though probably not the 
best ones.  Our level 49 Selos lasts for 2.5 minutes now, so we can Selos 
groupmates for runs through indoor zones and stuff, but nothing like the 
30+ minutes that SoW lasts.
I have tested my run against high level druids, and even against 
Paladin/Shadow Knight AA horses, and I am significantly faster.
