Just on the chance that this is real :)

you have learned a lesson, you should know this stuff already, women can 
do what they want, they like to have fun, they like to flirt some of 
them and most of it is innocent, if you get your feelings hurt its own 
fault see?  be a man, be a Gentleman, at all times and don't spoil it 
for the rest of us who can handle it.

If this was a real life thing you'd be lucky to ever get laid in your 
town for the rest of your life, chicks talk, highly evolved 
communication systems or something.  Be glad this happened in a game and 
not real life.

Now that you've stopped playing EQ, go make some money then you've have 
real wimmens.
