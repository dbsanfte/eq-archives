I was under the impression that you can make any other int caster's spells
by using the combine container of that class.... so for a wizzie to make a
necro's spell, you'd need the necro's book.

I play a rogue, so not really sure about the post-51 research...  are the
combine containers no drop and given to you based on your class?  That'd be
the only thing that would throw a wrench in to the equation.
