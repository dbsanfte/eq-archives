Not sure what weapons you want, but at lvl 15 you should be fine west of
the wall. As a rogue you will probably need to group, but I don't think
that there is much over level 15 out there. You could try the top floor
of Runeeye (with a partner/ group) too.


> What lvl is 'semi-safe' in Kithicor Forest? 

In the day, staying to the zone edge, level 1
At night, not sure, about level 45 ?
Really you will only want to travel through.
Do a /time and make sure that it is morning (after 8am before 12)
Then run through following the zone wall.
You *should* be fine.

You definatly want to bin the rusty axe.
Have you kept all your weapon skills up ?
I hope so.

I'm sure that others here will have some suggestions for you.

There is a quest in riverdale for a rogue-ish 2hs.
Not very good at dealing damage, but a good way to train up.

There are not that many

Needs to be off of the fish.
There are other quests involving the pirana teeth.
Keep killing them and he will spawn.
It can be a bit of a wait sometimes.

It sure is.
