I forgot to mention how I did it, so that others can try.

Find a tree on top of a hill, where the top of it is higher than the
aqueduct top. There are several. You must SoW and Levi yourself.
Normally this would not be enough, as you can only get about 1/3 of
the way up before you stop. However, I then shrink myself and start
creeping up the tree, all the way to the top. From there it's easy to
get on the top of the aqueduct.

To get on top of the arena, you have to take the teleport pad up to
the observation deck. All the windows except the ones right behind the
teleport pads will prevent you from going out them. So you have to go
out those windows and crab around the ledge (best done shrunk) until
you get to the last little bridge things that connect the wall to the
buildings. Go down the bridge, then go back up it on the lower ledge
(you can't just use the top ledge, because it gets very small at this
point and you can't easily get around the windows without falling)
(must be done shrunk for most races), follow it around to the back and
drop down on to the wall. You can then run to the arena. Watch out
though. There are lots of places you can fall into that you can not
get out of unles you can port or gate. Not even any mobs you can use
to hammer out with either.
