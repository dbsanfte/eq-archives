So after a few months away from eq I thought I'd dust off my rogue and =
see where I left him off.  Turns out he was in OverThere.  I hunted =
there for a bit in a group, got bored and split back to mainland to give =
lower guk a shake.  The rogue is level 31, I meet up with a warrior, =
druid and a wiz and we did the spider room / bedroom area.  It went well =
until warrior pulled the wizard ledge or something and we got a slew of =
froggies.  Our wiz did evac, but unfortunately the tank bit it.

Well that was my exciting introduction paragraph, now for some generic =
stuff.  When I was in guk with these guys, it was pretty darn empty, =
only around 20 people or so and this was on a Sunday ~12pm CST.  Is it =
always this dead? =20

Any hints on soloing here as a rogue in the event I can't find a group =
in the future?  I remember the old days pre Kunark, this zone was =
bursting at the seams with people, now they all split from the mainland. =
 Pikers...

I'm not really after phat lewts or anything (at least yet), rather I'd =
like to get a bit more XP under my belt.
