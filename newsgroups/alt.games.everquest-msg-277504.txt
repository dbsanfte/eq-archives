"Bob Perez" <myfirstname@thecomdomaincalledSHADOWPIKE> once tried to

Yeah, actually WoW is the only MMOG I've actually PLAYED for six months 
running. I've paid for accounts longer than that though LOL. But I'm pacing 
myself in this game and enjoying it, even though it's starting to get to 
the point where everyone is 60 except me. Meeting a genuine n3wb is always 
a refreshing thing. 

My /played on the main can't be more than 10 days and I got a half dozen 
alts that might total up to 4 or 5 days played.  Basically any more gaming 
than this and I risk divorce and unemployment, which I won't do. :)  Plus I 
like to do other games periodically. I had a stint with Jedi Academy, a 
brief fling with CoH, for a while, and did several review games. And some 
console gaming, with D&D Heroes on Xbox, and a bit of Halo 2.
