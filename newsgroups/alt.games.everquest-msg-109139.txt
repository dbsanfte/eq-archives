You hit hard -- but yours is my favorite response --

I believe that, reduced to animal instincts, we would all be feeding off
each other, well armed and with out rules. It is our irrational attraction
to heroism, beauty, life, flowers, babies and bunnies that keeps
civilization from drownding in its own gore....

I like games that help kids embrace the flawed ideal of heroism rather than
the bitter reality of base carnivorism.

I am sorry about using the "mental disability" concept. Most of the mentally
ill or disabled people I have been honored to work with are heros in every
way....
