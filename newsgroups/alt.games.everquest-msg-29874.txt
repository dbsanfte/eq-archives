No, thats the point, with c2 and Barrier of Force (and Flowing thought
1 if you work hard and get a shawl), the wizard with these will never
have to sit down.  They work regardless of whether you are sitting or
standing as long as they are equipped, just like a Fishbone Earring
does.

I'm hoping the effect of shawls 8-10 will scale exponentially to be
like this item, once they go in.  Also hoping there will be similar
upgrades found in Luclin but not holding my breath either..

Congrats to all the wizzys that got em, I cant imagine why Verant
would give you items this powerful, but enjoy it while it lasts!
