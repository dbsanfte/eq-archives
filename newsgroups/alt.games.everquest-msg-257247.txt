I haven't been paying attention to OOW, but I suspect (and hoped) that it
would be a bow.  Not because Foxeye would have wanted an epic bow, but
because so many rangers had been asking for an epic bow for so long.

But for SOE to then turn around and say that they don't view it as the
ranger's main way of doing damage is LAAAAME.  And to specifically point
out dual-weild as well.  Unless I'm so out of it that I've missed in-game
fixes to the weakness of DW vs. 2H weapons.
