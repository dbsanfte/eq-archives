I could post the pertinent parts of my logfile from that day.  Of course,
those are easily edited.  It was definitely stated in the broadcasts on Dec
3rd prior to shutting down EQ.  It was confirmed by at least one GM as well,
that DX8.0A would be required.  I believe (would have to check the log
file), that there may have been some discussion about the DX requirements at
that time, but the official VI stance was that 8.0a was required.
