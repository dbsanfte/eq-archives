That was my idea, they have slow, but not disease based slow, which is
very valuable against mobs you can't land magic based slow on. Or so I
assume - my shaman is only level 43, and has only used magic based
slows, and I've never been on a raid so I can only go on rumour.

While Unkempt Druids may make sense as a source of evil PC druids,
none of the evil races seem to have a culture where druids make
sense. I could see evil human/elf/halfling druids, but that would
require a new deity for them to worship (Tuna Zek, god of violent
wilderness, perhaps? ;-) ).

What deity do the unkempt druids follow, anyway? I know little of the
lore of the Unkempt Druids, I haven't done any quests involving them
or read any books.
