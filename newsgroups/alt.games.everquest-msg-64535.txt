Of course, it is the competition and only the competition that makes it
difficult... but that was exactly my point.  A bottleneck mob on an epic that
every guild wants their clerics to have, its ugly only because of that... and
its still very ugly.

Sure is, and Lord G and B are even more so... heck, I could have (and should
have, attention all young clerics) camped them at 40 and 30, respectively,
and gotten gobs of exp instead of a trickle of cyan and nothing at all...
Plasmatic Priest is a simple swat for a single group (I took two but that
was clearly overkill)

I can't say I've even heard of that mob, but I -have- heard warriors say that
the item they get is lame in comparison to some much easier quest items.  This
would mean, logically, that there shouldn't be much of a bottleneck on that
dragon.

I still think that its not that big a deal.. but I've looked at the other epics
and come to the conclusion that at least its more useful than they are.
As I said, can't exactly complain.

I'm only working on it because I've caught epic fever from being in a guild
that works on two or three epic pieces in a night every couple nights.
Guildmaster asked me where I was in mine when I joined, and said
"bah" when I said nowhere.  Well, now I'm three days in, or more than
half done... or almost as far away as when I started, depending on
how you look at it.  Couple more fights, and I'll be able to shelve the
project, when I'm asked I'll say I have my pearl and am on the list.  Best
news of all is there's no more insessant camping and killing green placeholders
to be done; somehow I don't mind helping friends do it, but when its
for something for me I simply despise it.
