I have to say that as a Shaman, I have found some of the tank types to by
highly trainable as pets.  The trick is to find one that has stamina below
100.  I have found Rangers, and certain classes of warrior to be the best.
They will do almost anything for that stamina buff.  Toss in a Tuna as well,
and you will have them eating out of your hands in no time at all.
