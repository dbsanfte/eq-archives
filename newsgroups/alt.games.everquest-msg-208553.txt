It was supposed to prevent the bottom feeding pharmers from monopolizing
lowbie/midbie quest and cash loots.  It has two huge problems:
1) it's a overly blunt instrument (along the lines of trying to do
fine goldsmithing with a ten-pound sledge), and
2) it was applied to an existing system that was designed without
regard for it.
If TLC had been part of the system from the start, and was an individual
flag like NODROP, it would've been a nice addition to the tuning tools
available to the developers.  As it is it makes many quests seriously
problematic.  It's actually, IMO, seriously anti-RP in context because
it makes it extremely difficult to complete many quests without the use
of spoilers and shared accounts.  I guess that's more anti-immersive
than anti-RP per se, but RP kinda presumes immersion in the environment.
