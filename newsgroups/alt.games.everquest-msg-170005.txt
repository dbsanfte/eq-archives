I just went to that decision and this is what i chose. I decided to make a
ranger. I give the ranger all the bonus points into stamina. I decided to
work on trade skills to make the tunarian soldier armour and faydark bows.
My crit at level 12 with a bow is 45 damage. I get dual weps and parry and
dodge and i get some benificial spells. Warriors i thought where boring just
sit back and tank. Clerics mostly sit and heal as need. Shamans are great,
im jealous with them vrs my druid, they get pets and most of my spells. Monk
seems interesting as long as you can get haste items and some real light
armour to up your ac. But I chose ranger, because I like the bow, I like the
added HP's with the stamina, I like to hide and nightvision from being a
woodelf. Plus I do alot of damage, and a ranger with a bow can inflict more
damage than any other class, with damage in the 1900 range with a bow. You
can get alot of items to up str and agi and dex, but I chose to put the
points into stamina. I hope this helps, I kinda like to root mobs and pepper
them with arrows, then finish them off with dual weps as root brakes. Thats
just me.
