This thread is a waste of time. I'm not responding to it anymore as it's
obviously a matter of opinion. Please don't try to extend this thread any
further and force me to go through the trouble of adding you to my KF (which
I don't currently have enough of a reason for). Yeah I know you don't care
about being on the list but let's forget this thread. It's a waste of time.
