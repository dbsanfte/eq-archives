Oooh -gots to piggy back here:

Mage = The Ultimate Farming Machine

The only way to farm faster than 1 mage, is to add a BL to the
mix.

You don't even have to face the mob - F8, /pet kill

then hit the Loot hotkey

/pet target
/pause 1
/assist
/pause 1
/loot

The only time I slow down is when I get a mob that is OOR of
the /pet kill command and have to look around to move closer.
