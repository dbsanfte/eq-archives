Faster processor, better video card.  Keep in mind, though, I have a
significantly better system than yours and the lag in bazaar is still at an
annoying level.  There are a hell of a lot of players there at any one time
so you'll probably always have lag unless you get a system that's absolutely
top-of-the-line.

On the other hand, I can deal with lag quite easily simply by turning to
face the wall.  Of course, when you're moving around that doesn't work but
you should be able to move fairly easily.  The worst part abut the lag is
when you're doing stuff in the bazaar window and it takes forever to do
anything, so just face the wall when you're donig that, or when you're
memming and/or casting spells, and when you're doing tradeskill stuff, etc.
