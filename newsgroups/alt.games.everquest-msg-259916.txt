Julie brought up a case where she clearly hit a mob first and then a high 
level came by and did major damage and the mob went grey on her (indicating 
she would no longer get xp). I theorized that this was anti-powerleveling 
code to mitigate this issue. They had to do something to prevent that 
obvious exploit and it looks like they did. Of course, this also opens up 
another hole for griefers (I don't know if the higher level got exp, so it's 
not clear if it opens up a hole for kill stealing).
