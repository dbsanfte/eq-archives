Awwww thanks!  I like it so far.  Lotsa friendly people.  Last night I 
begged somebody to cast "gravity flux" on me so I could see what 
happened.  Nothing happened.  Well, except I died.  Correct me if I'm 
wrong, but isn't that the spell that's supposed to toss you in the air?  
I saw my body fall and I felt ripped off :)

On another note, lotsa people looking for their bodies after that 
disconnection *g*
