Consider the evidence.
1. Luclin is not visible from Norrath.  There are rumors of it being visible
for a brief period some time ago, but if you go down there right now you
will not see Luclin.  If there was a moon circling Norrath you would see it.
2.  That we can see Norrath yet Norrath cannot see us suggests that we are
on a higher plane.
2.  Luclin has no sun.  Even in the lit up 'zones' there is no sun.  Yet
there is light.  There is light because Luclin is on a higher plane than
Norrath and the land itself provides its own light.
