Well, Khosh, I think our argument has gotten to the point at which we both
have opinions that neither of us can say for absolutely sure are correct.
So I tell ya what.  I'll play my free month of SWG when it comes out.  If
and when I discover it sucks, I'll come back and post on this board saying,
"Khosh was right, the game was lame!"  If I really like it, and it turns out
to be badass, then I'll come back and tell you how wrong you were :)  Cool?
