No its saying that folks who stick sharp pieces of steel in their eyes
can expect pain.  Valuable lessons to be learned when fighting snakes
are of great use when you get to higher lvls.  If you get to higher lvls
and forget what the snakes taught you, or you failed to learn from them
then life should be filled with suffering.  Those who can learn suffer
less than those who can't.  Makes sense.

No, I see me not dying because its not a good idea <G>.  The tactics
used by a creative group are unlimited so long as they have a reason to
remain creative.  Remove the incentive and everyone does stupid things
that are easy.  What is the fun in that?  Well I guess I should pose
that question as where is the fun for non stupid people in that?

I am quite certain that without the impetus of it being extremely
difficult to get back to the warrior's body we would never have
developed the "resurrection pull" technique my regular group got the
chance to perfect in an area with two mobs with major HTs standing next
to each other.  Who would have imagined that the enchanter could keep
them both mezed long enough for me to res the warrior back and get him
in fighting shape if we hadn't been forced to find out?  Making games
easier to appease folks who want it all to be nice and easy sort of
takes the fun out of it for folks who want an actual challenge.  I'd
rather games were not aimed at the low end of the spectrum.  Since there
are lots out there who would disagree with me on that point I again say
that developers need to create niche games rather than trying to appeal
to all.  Any game that satisfies those on the low end will likely bore
me and any game that I find challenging will likely make them cry.
