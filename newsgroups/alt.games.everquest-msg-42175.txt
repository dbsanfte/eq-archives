It took balls to bomb Serbia?  Hogswallow.  Clinton almost ran out of
Tomohawk missiles because the idea of having someone shot down on
_his_ watch scared him.  It could hurt him politically! <gasp>  Then
we hear of him dropping graphite powder on power plants to disable but
not destroy them, thus "sending a message" to Milosevic.  What a
limp-wristed nag.  Message sending is best left to hippy nuclear plant
protestors holding hands and singing "cumbaya" as their unwashed,
nappy heads of hair wave in the breeze, and you certainly don't ask
pilots to risk their lives "sending a message", unless you "loathe the
military."
