So why do you go all the way to LOIO windmill when they sell the vials in
FV? I know because my son buys then there.
Firiona Vie (docks) (Kunark)
old delivered book, suspension, mortar & pestle, constrict suspension,
larent suspension, poison vial, lined poison vial, sealed poison vial - Brak
Daggermist (building at -3560, 2350)
There are also a couple of other places like Freeport and Dagnor's Cauldron
that sell the vials. Check here.

Heh My son does play an enchanter and like I said died twice trying that
method to get the brownies to sell to him. A lot of other enchanters have
the same trouble getting that spell because when he had trouble I did a
little research at the enchanter messageboards and using wolf form is what I
found out.

Do a '/who all ench 16 24' during primetime and I'll bet you find at least
1, usually 3 or 4 at once all in LOIO.

Of course not - it's an "as needed" item. If you've got the vials and
pearls most enchanters with some spare time will set you up with a full
stack - most of the time for free.

Bah - do not post information about enchanters unless you have played one.
It's trivial to get the spells from the brownies, and any enchanter that
can cast the viscous mana spell? Guess what?

We go to LOIO to get the vials!

The dwarf in the windmill sells the poison vials. I don't know of any
other vendor on Norrath that sells them. Sure, we could make them
ourselves or hire a master potter, but why bother?

Nor do they need one. Butcherblock and GFay are prime locations to find
druids that can pop wolf form on you. Or you can just invis, run to the
brownies, at max range "Alliance" a guard, run inside, pop minor illusion
on, and buy all your spells.

Ppppth! If grouped and fighting, sure. If not grouped, the mana cost is
nothing. Illusion tree and in 15 minutes you've got a full stack of
viscous mana and I'll have a full bar of mana.

> but will have to have premade the viscous mana.

Aye, my enchanter has two stacks in the bank, ready to go, any time I need
them. Of course, I'm also a tailor ;-)
