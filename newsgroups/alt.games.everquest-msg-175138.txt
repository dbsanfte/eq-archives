Well we have guildies on test and they never mentioned a thing - it would
surprise me if its been tested quietly by guides and so on who already
have huge NDA type agreements. THey could download the stuff to those
people - mark the skins as say 'human' to other players and test the
mechanics that way. The zones could be optional like stonebrunt was with
some players seeing a blank wall and others the zone.

Not sure - the froglok race was listed at jan15th, with something else on
the 17th - that might be time of release of information since there was no
buy now option on my patch screen yesterday (though I couldnt get in at
all up to about 9.30 GMT)

If its fragmented then I guess they simply log you as having paid and each
bit patches in in the schedule, if they are simply releasing info and
possibly the code on the days listed then I guess it'll be after Feb 25th
or that last date on the website.

Well off Guk would allow the dungeon to remain and a fun city off the
side. Off innothule as a seperate city to guk would give you a newbie
yard. If they hacked around with Swamp of no hope then you could have a
Kunark start (say they have an underground city with exits in Field of
Bone and Swamp - then you wouldnt need to adjust the swamp beyond the
entrance).
