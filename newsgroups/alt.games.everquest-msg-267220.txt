I can only do that for green and blue solo mobs right now. For white
and higher ones, I have to help my beetle summon out with some spells
(which always results in the mob turning on me) :\

I also switch over to other tasks when regenning, though regen seems
pretty fast in EQ2 compared to some other MMORPGs I've played.

Hopefully, I'll be able to upgrade my summon spell level soon so it
can solo tougher mobs on it's own. Spent several hours last night
trying to find upgrades, but noone seems to be selling App III or
Adept I scrolls. :(
