Druids, on a good deal of servers, have a stigma attatched to them
that, for a good part, is a bit true. People see them purely as port
machines, with little other use in any departments. Wizards though,
have another use, their incredible nuking abilities, that's why
they're not regarded simply as a means to port for someone else.

Not to mention the fact that there are at leasat 35 million dr00dz
running around...
