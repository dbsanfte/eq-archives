Nope, they don't care about the crocs or the spiders either... nor
about any other non froglok mob in the zone that I can think of.

Also, they not only don't care about you killing the undead frogs,
they actually -like- it when you do, so you can improve or
fix faction that way.  Down side is that killing one live frog
means killing about a thousand dead ones to make up for it....
My cleric made it a hard and fast rule to never ever kill a
live froglok or help anyone who was doing so.  I've let
people die at my feet at the hands of frogloks, if there's no zone
line handy for me to pop a  heal out and leave before death.

The ability to move freely thru UGuk without hordes of green but
mean mobs swarming me every instant is beyond price.

I, on the other hand, fully intend to hunt those froggies into
extinction, UGuk looks like an excellent hunting grounds and
its a zone my cleric never got to hunt due to some tailless
squeamishness of his.  I will admit I left the froggies be till
I got my Mask.... But now I'm hunting the crunchy little things
as soon as I get my partner talked into it!
