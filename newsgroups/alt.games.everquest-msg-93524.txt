LOL funny you should mention this...  My Conjuration is now a WHOPPING 78...

As a Ranger, and a half elf, I never saw the purpose in Dancing Fireflies or
whatever that stupid spell is called...  Therefore, never bought it.
Finally made level 30 and got Swarm.  Conjuration was at ZERO...

I bought Dance of the Fireflies or whatever it is called and am raising my
skill by repeatedly casting that.  Of course, I also now know that I needed
this spell for my Epic Weapon quest anyway and had I known at the time, (or
been bothered to research at all) I would have bought it at level 15 and
been practicing it all along.

Don't know what to tell you other than practice, practice, practice...  Good
luck!
