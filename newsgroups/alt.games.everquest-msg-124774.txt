I'll go out on a limb and say no... more damage = aggro.

However, the reason it doesn't look like it is the mitigating factors
that the non tank classes get (or can improvise.) It all comes down to,
yet again, how well people play their class. If you have a monk and a
warrior of equal level and comparabel equipment, and they both get in
toe-to-toe range and just start wailing for all they are worth, the monk
WILL get the aggro even if the warrior is taunting. Maybe not right
away, but they will. 

The thing that stops it is aggro mitigation. I don't play as closely
with monks and chat enough to know all the details of the tricks they
use (e.g. watching range, positioning, the well timed FD, etc.) but I
can give you a great example for rogues.

I have had the misfortune to get in both xp groups and raids with rogues
who seem to just be out to KS or show how much damage they can do, and
are frankly unskilled at their craft. They turn into manasponges for the
clerics and really don't do much for the group.

On the other hand, before he retired, I used to never get tired of
watching Orlun play his rogue. He was a master at the rogue trade and
knew all the tricks. I only found out from all the chats we'd have about
improving tactics, etc. and what he was trying. He'd be in there
fighting right from the go, but he'd immediately get position at the
back of the mob at max range. He also didn't lead off with a huge
backstab. He's just start with normal piercing attacks, and let me
(tank) build up aggro before starting in on the huge hits. He also
didn't constantly mash the evade key like some monks do. Judicious use
of evade, and thus having it ready for when the mob *does* turn on you,
is critical to getting it off you immediately and back on the tank. If
you're just hitting it all the time, you're wasting it and likely won't
have it ready when the mob does spin around and start wailing on you.

Rogues (along with monks and others) can and do generate more aggro than
the tanks with their massive damage. They just have tools and skills to
mitigate it so that they don't get creamed and let the tank do his job.

I can't help but think the same applies to monks. Surely, Martin, you're
not just standing there with the tank, side by side, and laying out
everything you can from start to finish with no thought or effort on
your part to keep aggro off you?
