Have to agree totally with Sui and Lokari here --  Unprecedented I know but
there you are.

I have four alts (Monk, NEC, Meat Shield and a Cleric) Not one of them has
begged a sow or a buff from anyone, nor will they ever except in the case of a
CR.

My 52 Druid WILL SoW and buff when he has the time and, he will actually go out
of his way to SoW someone for a CR but, try zoning in somewhere and within 30
seconds  get a tell demanding a SoW, anotehr buff or a port. It happens more
often than you think friend.  Believe me after being so afflicted for a number
of months a Druid starts to hide going anon or into roleplay. Most Druids I
know SoW and buff gratis when they are able. Try being an adult, hard I know,
and take your rejection with grace and some understanding please.

Try this experiment. Start a Druid and play it to 30, then come back and bitch
to the list about uncivil Druids!  But you probably won't. It takes  a degree
of intelligence and thought to play a Druid well.

Actually, the lack of civility displayed within this thread seems to originate
with the crowd who thinks they are *entitled* and seems to be paralled with 
*life* within EQ.

You don't think it just a tad demeaning to run around begging for a SoW or
buff? Getting from Queynos to HpH can be a pain in the butt SoWless. I know.
I've done it.  Chalk it up to a character building experience. When you
successfully do the run, you will end up with a feeling of personal
accomplishment.  Well I apologize for the assumption. Perhaps you won't.

Then you have the cretin who expects you to travel to him and buff him up! 
Your begging for a SoW was ignored? Perhaps the Druid was fighting. Perhaps he
was OOM and medding and AFK. Perhaps he was a guild officer doing guild
business. Perhaps he was involved in a Raid that turned into a death march. How
the hell do you know what he or she was or was not doing when your beg was
ignored?  Point is you don't. You simply assumed he was being an arrogant ass.
Look in the mirror friend for the ass.
