Just went to Casters Realm (http://eq.castersrealm.com/) and saw this:

EMERGENCY PATCH

This from the Network Status page: 
On Friday, March 8th, at 3AM PST, (11AM GMT), all servers will be
brought down for an emergency patch. The estimated downtime is 3
hours. 
- The EverQuest Operations Team 

One of the reasons for this patch is to apparently correct a bug when
fighting King Tormax which causes the zone to crash.
In related patch news, yesterdays patch also enabled the necromancer
spell Levant to work at any time during the day or night.
