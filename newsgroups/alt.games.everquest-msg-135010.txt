Does anyone here have an ATI Mobility Radeon M6 card and is able to play?
My driver version is 6.13.10.6037 and I think I am having issues with it. I
checked the official page for what version of the driver I should have but I
do not think their ATI Radeons are the same as mine, and I don't want to
mess up my computer.

Anyway, I get past the liscense agreement and the logos, and then a screen
comes up with OPTIONS at the top and it has "Mobility M6" on a scrolling
list (well it doesn't scroll because there is only one option). I assume
it's asking me to pick my video card, so I click OK and then it just goes
black, closes itself, and returns me to windows.

BLAH!!!

Brady
