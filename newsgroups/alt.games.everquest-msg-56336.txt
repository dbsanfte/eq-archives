Harmony the camp so it can be single pulled. Snare every mob pulled to prevent
running. Keep a damage shield on the melee characters unless you have a mage; if
you do, his damage shield is a tad bit better than yours. Try to hold some mana
to back up the healer if needed; I usually shoot for 30-40% for backup heals. If
the cleric is switched for a shammie, the two of you should decide who will be
primary healer. If it's you, healing becomes your number one responsibility.
Don't be afraid to sit and med up mana for heals instead of meleeing or nuking.
If it's the shammie, that reserve for backup heals is even more important
because he's more likely to run oom healing than that cleric. Without an
enchanter, you should keep root memmed so you can do a bit of crowd control if
needed by root parking adds. Other than that, melee and nuke as you see fit.
When you get SoW at 14, it become a high priority to keep all group members
(except bards - they hate being snared =P) SoWed as well; but don't let the bard
talk you into relying on Selo's for the group. It's just too likely that lag
will cause someone to get out of range and lose the song.
