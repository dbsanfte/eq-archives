1) Check for updated firmware for the router.
2) If you happen to be on a Mac disable appletalk, that seems to lock up 
some linksys models/firmware revisions.
3) try downloading and uploading some significant data, lets isolate 
this as either an EQ problem or not an EQ problem.
4) exchange the router as defective if possible. Linksys routers are 
usually pretty good, and if its a problem no one else is having. Its 
possible you've got a dud.
