I always keep ensnare memmed.  It has a slightly shorter cast time. 
That makes it slightly easier to cast through a mob hitting me, and more 
likely to hit before a running mob gets out of range (or catches me). 
If you are in a position where the difference in mana cost is 
significant, you're probably going to have a corpse recovery anyway.

The time to cast snare is if you find ensnare is fizzling or getting 
resisted a lot (or if you're trying to work up specialize alteration 
skill perhaps--but use minor healing instead).  The only time I mem both 
is when I need to snare several mobs and don't want to wait the 4 second 
recast time.
