Of all countries, China is the one that worries me the least. They are
proud, and they like making noise, but at the end of the day, they have
come to enjoy capitalism too much to endanger their trade status. At
this point, they are rich enough to have more to lose than to gain by
alienating the US.

The countries that are really dangerous are those with nothing to lose,
like Afghanistan, where there is nothing worth bombing, no
infrastructure to destroy, no economy to cripple, and people are just
too happy to become martyrs.
