No, they're just normal cyclops.  The Seafury version is on the next
island and won't aggro someone at the AC camp (unless trained, of
course.)

Place holders are Boog Mudtoe (level 18), aqua goblins (level 8),
normal cyclops (30ish).  The AC itself can be between 35 and 40,
but I think 40 is a high estimate.  None of the three I've killed
were level 40, although I might have just been 'lucky.'

Well, you've never done the camp.  I have, twice (for three rings
total.)  A full group of 30s could *easily* hold that camp, even
if they get the higher-level AC spawn.  And, as far as that goes,
the AC in SRo is supposedly lower-level than the one in OOT.

In theory, at least, I can't see a group around 30 having any
problems with that camp in OOT.  It's just not that hard and the
AC isn't a mob with a lot of HPs or special attacks or special
resists.  As I said, I'm certain I could have solo'd him at 34
(although I might have been a little lower level; my logs are
screwed up and I can't check the level I got my boots.  I know
I was hunting in Marus Seru, though, so I figure low 30s.)
