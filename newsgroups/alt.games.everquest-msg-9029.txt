But it is fun when some idiot keeps spamming the zone and
another idiot starts yelling at them to stop spamming rather
than ignoring them.  So as the latters shouts of stop
spamming start to fill the air of g'fay, You start the chant
of Spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam Spammity spam
wonderful spam, and the entire zone picks up on it.    Kind
makes the two idiots shut up for a while, unless they both
start yelling for everyone to stop chanting (cue the
vikings) Spam spam spam....
