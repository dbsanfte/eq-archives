At 30, you'd probably want to go at least to the graveyard, i think.
Mobs close to zone in might be green to you.  If you had the zone all
to yourself, it would be fairly safe, but if you had someone trying to
pull the castle, the question is not 'if' but 'when' the train is
going to hit you.  

Keep sow up, know your way to the zoneline... s'my advice.
