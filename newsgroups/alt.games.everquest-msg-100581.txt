My guess is that most bigger MMORPGs requires payment in US founds or
Euros, and don't expect other non-freeware games to be much cheaper.
Paying US$ with a Visa from outside US has no practical overhead
unless you're living in a country with high inflation, and in that
case the Euro will drain you just as much...

Still, switching to a new game forces you to buy it and that will most
likely cost you MORE than the EQ price-raise accumulated over a
complete year; and when it comes to gaming a year is a loooong time.
So if you're so broke that a 3$/month increase makes you stop playing
EQ then you basically can't afford anything else than freeware for the
next year. If you're so burnt out of EQ that ANY excuse for leaving
will do then go ahead.
