I've been playing for about the same amount of time, I have a
level 65 cleric and a couple other characters in their 50s, and I
still make new characters and play them for weeks under 20.  I
know -how- to level quickly, but I really enjoy playing around in
the low levels sometimes, then I get a bug to hit the new spell
level or get some new ability and I shoot up 5 levels in a few
hours.  I've been at the upper end (not, admittedly the upper
upper upper end, honestly half the game is still left when you
hit 65) and I enjoy the journey more than actually being up
there.

I certainly wouldn't worry about a guild under 50, though, I've
seen few low level ones that are any help and if by some miracle
you find one you really like, you'll either outgrow it or it will
outgrow you, the odds of a bunch of people that don't exclusively
group together (and never solo) staying together in the lower
levels is pretty low - and in your 50s you'll get to where there
are things you want to do that are hard to do without a guild of
people that level; lower level people won't be any help, and
higher level people will be more interested in the higher level
stuff thats going on... and probably defecting to high level
guilds just like you are about to do.
