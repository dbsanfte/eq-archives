I haven't seen it so I'm speculating here, but I don't think I could be too 
emphatic in saying you should hold off. These kinds of guides are usually 
not recommended for any MMOG since they are outdated fast as things change 
rapidly in the MMOG world. But in this particular case, so many things 
changed dramatically in the final days before release, I can't imagine that 
25% of what's in the guide will be accurate. I wouldn't want to guess which 
25%, either.

Buy it only if you feel a desire to have everything published about this 
game. And even then, only if you don't care about accuracy.
