Druid roots are resisted more frequently than normal root spells. Why?
There's a resist check to the damage componant and the root itself. If
one is resisted, the whole thing is resisted. On the plus side, it
always does full dmg. Downside is it's not much damage. Also, I think
magic resist in general is more common on mobs than most resists...
