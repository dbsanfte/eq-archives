Only Wis casters (like your druid) can heal.  That includes Shaman, Clerics,
Paladins, Rangers and Beastlords.  Monks and Warriors can heal with bandages
to 75% of health once they get the Bind Wound skills up high enough.

Remember to learn how to fear.  Let your pet beat on the back of a fleeing
mob.

Bandages.  Lot's of them.

Only Druids, Rangers, Wood Elves and Dark Elves can hide (I think I got them
all)

The low level game is very different.  Most pepople are too tuned in to
levelling quickly to remember that there are others playing also.  This
changes.

Enchanters are group oriented, not solo.  They can solo and very
effectively, but take a lot of skill (more skill than any other that I've
tried to solo, anyway)

http://eq.crgaming.com and http://allakhazam.com are the 2 best general
sites, in my opinion.
