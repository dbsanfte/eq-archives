I wouldn't put skill points into your main weapon beyond your first 
level or two.  Reason being, it will go up all on its own, with use.

Skill points give you a way to boost new skills or ones that lag behind, 
each level your cap on every skill raises 5 points, and if you use that 
skill regularly, it will almost certainly go up those 5 points during 
the time it takes to go up a level (the first few levels this isn't 
true, because they just FLY by)

I'm not terribly familiar with paladins, so I can't really tell you 
where it might be better to spend the points, but among likely suspects 
are Bash, Kick, 2 hand blunt, piercing... and then there are some of 
your casting skills which you won't get till level 9, often there's one 
type or another which is useful for a spell you use in emergencies but 
which is rarely used in day to day fighting.  Idea is to use the points 
to raise skills which don't go up on their own very well.

A couple key ones, Taunt and Bash, I've found don't raise on their own 
very well until you get them up a ways.

Another thought, though, with many skills, when you spend your first 
point in them you get them at a skill equal to your current level.  so 
if you are sure you won't be (for example) using a 2 handed blunt weapon 
any time soon, you might wait till level 20, put one point in and get 20 
points free, then plug more in and raise it to 50 or so, before starting 
to work with a brand new 2 hand blunt weapon you've found.

There's nothing wrong, either, with saving up points.  They won't be 
lost if you don't use them, and saving them for a skill you don't have 
yet, or didn't realize would go up very slowly, can be very handy.
