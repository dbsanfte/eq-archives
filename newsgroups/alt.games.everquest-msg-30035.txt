And how many of these "True Old Style" Hackers would be breaking into
someones EverQuest account to sell or delete or trade every item that the
person had causing that person's account to be "unjustly" suspended due to
this new rules change? The whole issue of this thread was started on the
basis that a "Real" Hacker (what ever the definition we decided it to be)
would break into someones account, removed everything from that accounts set
of characters, and cause the account to be suspended. How many of these
"True" Hackers would do that in EverQuest?

I personally believe that any of these old definitation hackers that are the
robin hood of the computer society would never even waste their time with
something like a small individual account. In fact, I believe that anyone
that would ever even considered to break into an individual account of a
person they did not know would be doing so to do that criminal activities I
first suggested and got flamed for. Making them a modern-day media-hyped
criminal hacker. And those would be so small in number as to be almost
negible and handled on a one by one case.

The vast vast majority of EverQuest compremised accounts are done so because
of the stupidity of the account owner and are deservent of what they get.
