Well, there are plenty of zones for you to choose from, unfortunately 98% of
the people in your range (and mine) seem to be in Dreadlands. Most other
places are "bring your own group" and you won't easily find pickup groups. I
went to City of Mist around 44, and the experience was excellent, but we
brought our own group (enchanter a must). There is also LowerGuk and SolA.
You will probably have an easier time putting together a group since you
will be partnered with a cleric. As much as I've come to hate Dreadlands, it
is the only place I've been able to quickly find a pickup group. If you can
get a druid to join you, you may be able to recruit people out of Dreadlands
to go elsewhere. Good luck!
