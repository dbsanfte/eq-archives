Cured silk is for monks-- you'll want to look for raw silk armor as a
caster. You can even make it yourself with a good supply of spider
silks. Start looking for robes to buy off players or vendors, such as
a senior apprentice robe. Jewelry is also pretty inexpensive, so try
to grab some good pieces to increase your statistics.

As an enchanter you really shouldn't be concerned with melee. I carry
around a dagger just for kicks (I'm at level 22), but I hardly ever
use it. The rest of the time I'm carrying a stein and one of those
voodoo dolls from the Lake of Ill Omen. A crude stein is another nice
item you can carry. In earlier levels you might do a bit of melee if
you're soloing with your mobile damage shield (i.e. your conjured
animation), but once you start getting higher in levels it's almost
suicide to do that. In groups your primary task will be casting spells
for crowd control and such.

If you haven't already, check out the enchanter section at
eq.castersrealm.com, especially the levelling guides. There are some
very good tips in there!
