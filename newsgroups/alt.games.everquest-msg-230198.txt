The last time I ever played a newbie in MT, I was actually glad when
some high level players came to kill the wall guards.  It seemed like
whenever a newbie trained something to the guards, those little Zorros
would then go on a rampage, running around between the wall and the
Runneye zone for the next few minutes and KS'ing everything in sight.
It was rather nice to actually see them be occupied by other players
for a change.  (plus there were always a few guards in the little
rooms near the wall entrance that the guard killers would usually not
kill so newbies could always run around the corner from the wall
entrance if they were in trouble).

I think they might have fixed it in one of the patches so that the MT
guards no longer KS'ed half the zone, but I'm not sure since I haven't
been there in a while.
