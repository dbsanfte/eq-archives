I have a friend in the program. "Guide xxxx here. How can I assist
you?" is the encouraged greeting. At least on his server.

"Canned responses" do NOT make a CS rep incompetant. It's part of the
job in most cases...

True, but it tends to be good to get to the player as soon as possible
when pulling the response. The longer they wait before hearing from a
guide/GM, the angrier they tend to get.

...see above.

If a player feels that "how can I help you today" means they're not
getting "personalized" help, they are rather spoiled brats if you ask
me. The "canned" greeting is the only thing "canned"...

Tech support for DirecTV. In some cases, you get a display of the
problem when the customer calls in. You also get their phone number
and account info as well. You still answer by asking phone number,
name on the account, and "how can I assist you?". No one's ever
complained about that greeting...

Frankly, you're coming across as an arrogant asshole.
