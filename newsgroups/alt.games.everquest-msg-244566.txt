What you're saying, in essence, is that because the Test server *isn't*
actually used for "testing" in any structured way, and all of the bugs that
are found are found while people are "playing" on Test, that this is a good
reason to never make it a structured "testing" environment.

Sony at least seems to agree with you.  :P
