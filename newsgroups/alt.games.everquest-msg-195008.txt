Grouped with a shortie softskin level 10 cleric yesterday, we
both dinged 11 within a couple kills of each other (she actually
shortly after me).  Fought a while longer and she dinged 12... I
was at 4 yellow in!  Later she hit 13 with me less than 4 yellow
into 12!

Oh, and my subject line is wrong, she claimed to be a dwarf
cleric, not a halfling one.  I discount this, however, as dwarves
have that funny facial hair they call beards, clearly she was a
halfling.

How you are supposed to tell male from female on races that don't
have horns, I don't know.  There was a troll in the group with
horns on his helmet and those ears... looked like a pretty
clueless cross dresser, since females have -three- horns, not
four!
