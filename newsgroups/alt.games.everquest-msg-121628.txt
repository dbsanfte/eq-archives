There have been Windows versions.  The only thing that is stopping a Windows
port of the current version of ShowEQ is the lack of decryption code,
because the ShowEQ developers have kept the source to the decryption code
closed.  The ShowEQ developers are opposed to a Windows version, so until
someone else independently breaks the encryption, ShowEQ will stay
Linux-only.  (Although if someone was really desparate to run it on Windows,
there is always VMWare...).

The relationship between Verant and ShowEQ is odd.  Verant occasionally does
things to break ShowEQ, but I've never seen them make a serious attempt to
stop it.  There are fairly simple things they could do, that would not
require significant resources, that could put a big dent in ShowEQ, if not
outright kill it.  Instead, the most they do is diddle with their weak
encryption, so that ShowEQ breaks for a couple of days, and everyone who
wants to keep using it then has to update.

My guess is that Verant doesn't want to get rid of it entirely, but they
want to make sure only certain kinds of people use it.  From what I've seen,
there are several kinds of ShowEQ users:

1. People using it for research.  E.g., figuring out spawn cycles, how group
XP works, how pet XP works, etc.

2. People using it to get a big advantage over other players.  E.g., to get
notified when Quillmane spawns and then run right to it.

3. People using it to reduce EQ frustrations, without getting a significant
advantage over others (except in being less frustrated).  E.g., checking to
see if Vox is up, before asking your guild to make the annoying trip to
Permafrost for a raid.

4. People using it to help others.  I knew one guy who, when some lowbie
would be starting to panic because he died in some scary zone while linkdead
and can't find his corpse, would "happen" to stumble across the body and
tell the lowbie the coordinates.

5. People using it to compensate for bugs.  This is sort of the same as #3.
For example, seeing where warping mobs warp to.

6. Navigation.  This is again sort of the same as #3.  Getting lost is
annoying.  Seeing a map that shows where you are in the zone and what
direction you are facing can greatly increase your enjoyment of the game.

7. People using it to get a small advantage over other players.  E.g.,
finding regular XP mobs faster.

8. Guides and GMs using it to provide better customer service.

People using it for #2 are bad.  People using it for #4 are good.  #1 can go
either way.  #3 is probably good.  #5 could go either way...depends on
whether the bugs are bad enough that the people without ShowEQ are at a
significant disadvantage.  #6 is probably good.  #7 is probably good...it
would seem bad at first, but there are actually, in many zones, a *lot* of
areas with good XP mobs that are underutilized because they aren't near zone
lines or good camp spots, so people crowd onto a few mobs.  If the ShowEQ
users spread out and take some of those other mobs, everyone wins.  #8 is
good.

So, I think Verant has decided that as long as it doesn't become widespread,
they won't try to permanently stop it.  The ShowEQ developers keep it Linux
only to help keep it from becoming widespread.  It also helps that they have
not gone to great effort to make it run on a variety of stock Linux
distributions.  Instead, they like to make use of the very latest version of
the compiler and QT (QT is the toolkit used to write the ShowEQ GUI),
meaning that to keep up with ShowEQ, you have to be able to not only get
Linux running (which is not hard nowadays), but also be able to upgrade
stuff from the versions your distribution included to the latest
cutting-edge development versions.  Verant's normal patching, and
occasionally token change to encryption, makes it so that if you don't keep
up with the latest ShowEQ, it stops working.

So, basically, the only people who can consistently run ShowEQ are those who
are somewhat "into" Linux.  From what I've seen, that does not include many
of the "kewl d00dz" types that would mostly use ShowEQ in the bad ways.

Then there are the people who /petition "The last patch broke ShowEQ.  Do
you know when it will be fixed?"...  :-)
