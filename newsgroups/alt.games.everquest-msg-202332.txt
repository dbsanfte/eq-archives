I've been informed by my fiance that we "have to, have to, have to" be able
to handle Star Wars: Galaxies when it comes out. So with what was said
above, will the Ti4200 be able to meet their reqirements of a "100% DirectX
9.0 compatible computer" and "Required: 32 MB 3D Graphics card with Hardware
Transform and Lighting (T&L) Capability; Recommended: 64 MB 3D Graphics card
with Vertex Shader and Pixel Shader (VS/PS) Capability"? If it will be able
to handle SWG, that's what I'll go for. If not, I'll have to pick something
else to maintain household harmony.  :)
