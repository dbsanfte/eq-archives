Now I wish I hadn't posted that paticular comment now... I'm not homophobic
and I don't dislike gay people.  I wasn't making fun of the guy for being
gay, though perhaps I was making fun of him a bit for being such an obvious
flamer... I mean, isn't there anyone else who finds people who flaunt their
sexuality to extremes, strought or gay, somewhat annoying?
