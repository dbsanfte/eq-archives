Mmmm... it's not quite that particular exploit... it's not a pathing bug,
it's 'terrain explitation'.

There's nothing wrong with casting/pulling a critter from across the moat in
Crushbone... even though it has to run along the far bank, cross the bridge,
then run back towards you on the near bank... that's actually legal. What I
was doing that got me into trouble was jumping back across the moat after
the Orcs had crossed the bridge... forcing them to run all the way back
again. By taking the shortcut across the moat, I was exploiting terrain...
because the AI doesn't let critters try a risky jump (in most cases).

I knew that the Orcs could follow me into the water if I missed the jump...
and at only 14 my swimming was nowhere near useful... so I was going to (and
actually did) die if/when I missed the jump.

I'm not ducking any blame here... I've been 'officially' warned that what I
was doing is an exploit and I've not tried doing it again. I'm just pointing
out that you have to be a little careful when you try being 'creative' with
your tactics. Sometimes the line is a little blurred, and you might have
crossed it without realising :o)
