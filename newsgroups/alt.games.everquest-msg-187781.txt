I HATE the term toon. It's one of those "finger nails on the
chalkboard" things for me. Another peeve of mine is the proud display
of ignorance when some substitue the letters ah for er (or other
variations) - as in killah for killer. Since when has ignorance become
"cool"? Do they think it's funny? Original? Cute? To me it's none of
the above and simply annoying. Although "dewd" speak is almost just as
annoying, or the RanDoM capItaLiZatiOns oF lEtterZ. Maybe I'm just
getting old and cranky.
