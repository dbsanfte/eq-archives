Note "almost always".

Kithicor is very dangerous at night, but by no means is it an
automatic deathtrap, even for low level characters. Luck will
sometimes go against you and you'll get whacked, but staying high on
the north wall will generally keep you safe. For those looking for a
zero risk proposition, wait until daylight. And even then, stay on the
north wall as there are some wandering nasties during the day.
