I have an account for sale.

No characters, yet, so it's al ready for you to put in whatever you want to
play, on any server you like.

I'll even throw in the CD, and complete copies of the manuals.

Thing is, I work odd hours, so I'll have to use a middle man to deliver the
stuff... how about I leave it at Software Etc.  You can pick it up anytime
they're open... and just pay them, they'll relay the money appropriately.

I never took it out of the shrinkwrap, so you'll get that too.
