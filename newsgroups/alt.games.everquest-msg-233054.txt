Might check up on your service

I am on Comcast Broadband - after finding info on the web deleted the
Broadjump Client Service and the 'helpful' utilities that installed with the
package.  Have not dropped in approx. 200 hours of play since...

Note:  The utilities are constantly dialing the company home to tell them
whatever, and not helpful to me in any way, and apparently from the web page
I read Broadjump was such a dog that the company that produced it had to
change its' name...

Something to consider, but as always, use at own risk...
