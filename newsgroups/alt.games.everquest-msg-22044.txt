I personally sit at a very cluttered desk strewn with scraps of pappers with
everything from late bills to notes on my roleplaying games.  In front of me
sits my EQ guide book and off to the side sit a 1 inch binder filled with
zone maps and internet found information pertaining to the zones i have
been.  Attached to the outside edge of my monitor and the desk itself are
dozens of post-its with names of people i buy from, sell to, group
with...current mana total and even items i am looking for or mobs i want to
hunt.

If i log off with something important to remember i put a post-it right on
the screen.

Oh i cant forget the dozens of mt. dew cans and bottles that are strewn
around me because i don't have time to get up and wash them out like i
should.  What was taht about how addicted to EQ we are in a previous post?
I would have to change my answer to an E....borderline F if i quite my job
or get fired...
