Personally, on all my characters I have "/assist' as a hotkey and
attack on assist off in the .ini.

Thus, when pulling I target the mob, hit the /assist key a few times
as I close in on it to make sure it is NOT attacking anyone else.

Works well.  Never really grok'd it until I started living by /assist
as a cleric.
