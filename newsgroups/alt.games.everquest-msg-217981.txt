PoV CY?

The storm riders are noticably easier than the giants in BoT.  Not sure 
how they compare to PoV golems and such, as this was my first time 
hitting the storm riders, and it's been a while since I grouped in PoV.

As the shaman, I would have had a real problem had I not had KEI and 
Canni V and torpor.  Keeping everyone hasted (using my 50% group haste), 
slowing the mobs, and healing as needed takes a fair amount of mana.  
With Canni V and torpor, and Canni IV until Canni V refreshes, I was able 
to keep my mana at a relatively stable level, dipping hard when we got 
two mobs or aggroed one of those stone guardians or whatever they are 
called.
