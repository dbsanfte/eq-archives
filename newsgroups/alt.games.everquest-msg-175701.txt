Sorry, I thought we were talking old spells (celerity is pre-pop). I
was taking the old, stacking on spell haste, bard song, my bad. Still
doesn't take away the fact that you are wasting about 40% haste, with
a 41 haste item and a 45% bard song you make 86%, compared to 125%
with swift like the wind and the 25% cap excieding song. And with a
decent EE item you have to cast that 3 times an hour, big deal.
