Not sure where's a good site for explaining how it works, but it's not
all that complex.  (Note that it did change in a recent patch.)  You
go to the Tribute Master in your home city and rightclick to open up a
window, via which you donate platinum and/or items, which builds up your
"current favor" with the gods.  You use the same window to select what
effects you want to obtain via tribute.  The window will show you what
level you have to be to get the effects at various "tiers", and how
much tribute each effect costs.  The effects act sort of like buffs,
except they don't use up buff slots, don't go away when you die, and
can't be dispelled.  (But, for instance, Haste via tribute doesn't add
to Haste via items or spells.)

Later, you can open the tribute activation window using Alt-U.  When
you activate your selected favors, the cost of all the favors gets
deducted from your current balance, and the favors are activated for
the next 10 minutes.  After that, every ten minutes, you get charged
again for the selected favors.  You can use the Alt-U window to turn
off all the favors (it's all or nothing unless you go back to your
home town Tribute Master to change your selections), but you don't
get any credit back for the current 10 minute block.

As for the tribute values of items if you turn them in, a good list
can be found at
