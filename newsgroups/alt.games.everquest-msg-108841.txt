Hi all,

I am not sure if it is just me, or some bug, but I am a level 51 Iksar
Beastlord, and noticed that I had 123 in my Divination spell skills,
so Invisability would always fizzle. As a matter of fact I think all
my spells were fizzling miserably, so I decided to take a few days and
find a secluded area and just cast spells, med and repeat. Well, I now
have Divination up to 193, and would you believe that it took 18
fizzles for invisability to cast more than once. Thankfully Invis only
uses 30 mana. Of course at this point Divination is only going up one
point every three times I drain my mana, so taking forever to get
there. It is not just Divination, I have a spell called Protect that
uses about 2 or 3 bars of mana before it casts, and I have 194 in that
spell skill (Abjuration I think?).

My question is this....If I continue to try and get to 200 or 201 will
these fizzles stop or at least get below 10? It is really annoying
because I like to travel around areas where I am KOS, and invis in
very important.
