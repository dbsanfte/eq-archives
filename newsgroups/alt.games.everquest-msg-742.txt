Nope, Sonnet is absolutely right.  If someone is the only healer and they spend
all their mana nuking, I'm leaving the group.  I've seen too many fuckwit
"don't tell me how to play my character" druids, clerics, shaman that blow
their mana nuking and not have any to heal the tanks.  I've seen tanks die
because of it and it's all too common.

If there are more than one healer then the situation is different, but if
someone is the only healer then they must heal and forgo the nukes and other
bullshit that gets people killed.

Once I've identified a fuckwit healer I usually leave the group because it is
also impossible to convince these idiots to alter their tactics.

I'm not really sure why shadowangel stands up for the right of healers to let
their tanks die, but I'm sure he's got a stupid reason.
