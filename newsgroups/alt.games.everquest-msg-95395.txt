First in a place like Oasis or Ill Omen keep your group small and make it
only people you know and trust.  You will find those people at this level
and they will tend to stay with you for a long time.  Once a stable group of
two or three is established, really you and a tank should be enough for
Oasis or Ill Omen unless you choose to fight mobs way over your level,
experiment with additional people and carefully explain what you expect of
them in the group.  If they work out add them to your group and move on to
more difficult mobs and if they don't drop them and don't bother with them
again once it becomes apparent that they are not willing to learn or accept
what you have to offer.  Truly groups built around an enchanter, healer and
a couple of tanks can be very powerful and productive, but bad player can
totally disrupt the groups effectiveness and if they cannot mend their ways
and adapt to the group should be quickly dropped.
