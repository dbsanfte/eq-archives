i picked up a Velium Spiked Skull Helmet in The Tower of Frozen
shadows. when this is equiped it appears my character has no helm.
in todays patch it metions trading in helms with no graphic for the
same helms with a graphic. unfortunately it doesn't tell you the NPC's
names, or where they are.
can anyone point me in the right direction?
