What do you mean no spells memmed?  I sure as hell have never died soloing 
because I didn't have spells (songs) memmed.  So discounting that rather 
cryptic criteria, you're saying that if you're in combat and you go LD, 
it's obviously a pulled plug.

Now you're not making any sense at all.  If you're FM and wearing 14 
buffs, you're not soloing, unless MAYBE you're a shaman.  How about those 
of us who can't buff really.  I'm a bard, I die if I go LD while kiting, 
but I have no buffs on me, other than a clicky-buff or two.  I guess they 
can't tell if I'm LD or just missed a charm.

Let me guess, you think that the car companies are all conspiring to keep 
the new engine that runs on water because they're in cahoots with the oil 
companies. 
Your statements here are illogical and prove your vast confusion about the 
issue.  If you're going to propose a solution to the LD problem, propose 
something that works for ALL classes.  Idiots who propose global solutions 
that only benefit their class are beneath contempt.
