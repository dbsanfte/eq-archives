I have had two VERY positive experiences with guides and surnames.

I roleplay my Erudite Mage as a far Eastern mystic. A Guide/GM was
kind enough to allow me the use of an apostrophe in my surname:
 Abunra Ben'Ghazah

A couple days ago my monk hit 20 and the server rejected my surname
for some reason. After about 20 minutes my petition was answered and I
was given my surname:
Valien Stillwater

I have never had a bad experience when dealing with a guide or GM. I
have petitioned for various reasons at least 15 times, and in each
instance I was dealt with fairly. Perhaps it is related to the fact
that I use tact and show repsect when I deal with the Guides/GMs.

Cheers
