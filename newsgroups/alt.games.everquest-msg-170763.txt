"When"????  They already have, and we fought them tooth and nail to get it
back.  Now, once again, they're trying to paint every conservative and/or
southerner as a racist again.  I think the left does far more character
assasinations than the right (though it may be only for the reason that the
right is constantly on the defensive, and doesn't have as much oppertunity
to nail the leftists to the wall).

Still a good zinger, none the less.

Hell no, we're trying to take the damn party back from the RiNO's.
Fortunately, they don't seem to have any problem leaving in their own Accord
(TM).  Or are you saying that Jeffords, Chafee, or McCain are conservatives?

Well, if someone's going to belong to our party, it's not too extreme to
expect them to actually believe in some of the things that we profess.

You have a point.  However, when truely principled people come around, I
think the Republican party generally makes a closer match than the
Democratic party.  I don't think J.C. Watts would have made a good Democrat.
Of course, there is the side issue attached to this of "Why The Hell Do We
Allow Our Worst To Lead Us????"

Unfortunately, that's been pretty well bastardized.  "Religion is to be seen
and not heard" seems to be the attitude of today.  I think it's starting to
swing, as some religious types with a cantankerous streak are being more
willing to stick their thumbs in the eye of "approved" opinion.

Criticism is not the same as condemnation, especially when the criticism is
focused on the idea, and not the person.  Otherwise we would both be thought
police for having this very conversation.

Well, capitalism has the advantage of taking greed and turning it to the
common good, that can't truely be denied.  However, I think just about ever
reputable right-wing thinker understands that capitalism goes far, far
beyond simple rewarding of greed.  In order to benefit myself, I must do
right by my customers.  I like the fact that the market punishes those who
are truely greedy (and put themselves ahead of their customers).  Of course,
I also like the fact that the government is there to take care of those who
cannot be swayed by the market (ie, trusts or those who commit fraud).

Even so, our definitions are still shakey.
