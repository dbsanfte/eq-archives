There is nothing circular about that. Are you just tossing out
buzzwords at random? Until its established that the pp (the only thing
that was stolen, rendering Faned's silliness irrelevent) actually
belonged to the seller, not Sony, its simply not a crime for reasons
many people have pointed out now. Its a scam, of course; the guy
swiped what must have been millions of pp. Definately against the
rules of the game. But its not a crime, and the deeper this thread
goes the more obvious it becomes that the pp simply can't have value
like that outside the game or more and more things become dangerously
questionable (I especially liked the Rallos Zek example).

Anyways I'll put it nice and simple for you just to clear it all up -
I don't give a shit if it might eventually be found to be illegal or
not, because 1: it hasn't yet therefore its not, innocent until proven
guilty and all that, 2: I don't really care to convince you or anyone
else that you are wrong, believe whatever the fuck you want, and 3: I
don't give a shit about the cheater who was scammed, I think he got
his just desserts, and if that makes be a bad person... I can live
with that. :-)
