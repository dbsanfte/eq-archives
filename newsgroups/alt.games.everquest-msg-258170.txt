/loot is a way of looting with a keyboard command, for when you
can't right-click on the corpse.  For example, when the corpse has
fallen completely inside a wall and is not visible.

In order to use /loot, though, you must first target the corpse,
which will also be difficult if the corpse is in the wall.

But if you have a pet it's easy, because the pet will keep the
mob's corpse as its target when the fight is over.  So you just
/assist the pet, and bingo, you've targeted the corpse, and now
you can use /loot.

That's why he was talking about pets.
