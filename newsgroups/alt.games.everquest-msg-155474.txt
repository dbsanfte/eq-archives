Number one, it does make the pet summoning easier. Instead of summon,
then level buff, all we have to do now is just summon. This removed
the "summon warder" buff icon as well, which means I won't have my pet
"wearing off" or getting debuffed on me, which is actually a VERY good
thing. Not having it zone is pretty trivial to me. I had to rebuff it
after zoning anyway if I wanted to use it, so what's the point? This
also fixed the "level buff=pet CHeal bug", which, IMO, is another VERY
good thing (tm).
