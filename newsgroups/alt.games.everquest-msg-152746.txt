heck, her pipe isn't even "hers" from the look of it.  Isn't Cox a cable 
company?  With a cable connection you share your pipe with the rest of 
the folks on your local loop, sort of the way office users all share a 
T1 or some such.  If you overload the loop with a web server its not 
just your connection that suffers but everyone in your neighborhood that 
is on the loop as well.  Of course cable companies will spend a lot more 
time telling you about how much bandwidth you "can" get based on you 
being the only user on the loop and are pretty hard to pin down as to 
just how many folks you are actually gonna  be sharing that circuit with
