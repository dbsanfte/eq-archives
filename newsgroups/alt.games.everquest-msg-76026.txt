At level 34 for druids and I think 16 for Wizards, we/they get a 4 target
one blast AoE spell of reasonable mana efficiency.  Later on both classes
get upgrades to these spells also  (and before, they have AoE spells, but
not of enough mana/damage ratio to be useful, also, the "rain" type AoE
spells won't work for this tactic)

For druids, by this time we have Ensnare (longer duration than Snare), so
the tactic is to ensnare 4 things and run wide circles around them until
they're all grouped up, then use the AoE spell on them, hitting all 4 at
once.

For wizards, I believe they don't get a snare spell until 29, so I suppose
that they have to be twinked with j/t boots, sow potions or just sowed
before this points, slightly different in that, from everything I've read,
they use their staff with that insta click LowerElements debuff to agro 4
things, THEN group them up and cast their AoE snare (if they have it yet),
then AoE nuke it to death.

Personally, I hate quadding, it's tedious, dangerous, and the med time is
boring as hell.   Then again, I tend not to solo much as a druid, except the
occasional HG, and even then I kill one or two and get bored and leave.
