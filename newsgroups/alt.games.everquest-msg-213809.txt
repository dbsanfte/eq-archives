Bah. The experience that made me instantly addicted to EQ was being lost 
in the EC woods at night, as a Human mage. The feeling of fear of the 
dark and dread of the forest was one of my most intense gaming 
experiences to date, and I was hooked on the spot. Then again, it was 
the very day of release, and EC *was* dangerous.
