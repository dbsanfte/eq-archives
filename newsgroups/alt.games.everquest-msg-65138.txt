As a followup to my first reactions post, before I had the Luclin
expansion.

Installed SoL today. Aside from the annoying music the installer
insisted on playing, the loading of the software went fine.

Ran the patcher, got all the patches in perhaps five minutes, via
cable modem.

The program started up fine. On the graphics settings I decided to go
for broke, and turned on everything, at 800x600.

Got into NK, had a seat in the Spires to wait for my first ride to
Luclin. And then I wandered around, totally lost, for a few hours. It
was fun! I often had entire zones to myself.

Zoning is indeed slower - it takes perhaps 2 to 4 times longer to
zone. I'm really not sure why this should be the case. Certainly there
isn't a need for more information coming across the cable modem - zone
loading gets *PC placement information and such, but all the geography
and textures are stored locally. I find it baffling that it should
take so much longer.

Still, it's not any worse than back in the days I played via dial-up,
and I could live with it then, so I guess I can live with it now, too.

There was occasional bad choppiness. Enough to be annoying, but most
of the time gameplay was quite smooth. There's tweaking that needs
done yet, obviously, but meanwhile it's very playable.

The new models that I saw all looked very nice, though I'm amazed to
see that they actually made female barbarians even bustier than
before, as if those broads needed any help.

Over all, quite pleased so far. Now I just have to learn my way
around.
