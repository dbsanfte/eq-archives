This is only true of player baked food, if your talking about vendor bought
food then it is all the same. Iron Rations, Rations, Bread, Muffins, Water,
and Milk will all last the same amount of time and provide no stat boosts.
If you are buying from a vendor stick to Muffins and Milk as they are the
cheapest. If you do any tradeskills you will want to have some cheap vendor
food handy as there is no sense wasting STR/STA/MANA buffing food when you
don't have to. Always remember that you will eat whatever food is first in
your inventory.
