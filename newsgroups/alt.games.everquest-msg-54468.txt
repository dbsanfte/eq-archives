    The politics on this move should be fascinating - it'll be fun to watch.
Background: on a few servers (one being Veeshan), the  guilds have gotten
good enough that they can take down targets like the Statue in Kael. And
they have been - on patch days, hours before any of the uberguilders are
even awake, and on the resulting early morning respawns. So certain mobs
just can't be killed by the uberguilds anymore, as they're never up. Causes
some tension, especially when the overseas guilds push their advantage and
demand loot/concessions in return for leaving a particular mob up
(uberguilds don't like being at a disadvantage). The one mob in particular
that's causing issues is the Statue.

    When the Statue drops, the Avatar of War pops. He doesn't stay long,
then despawns. Guilds like Fires of Heaven want to at least TRY to kill this
sucker, as right now there aren't any challenges left in game for them. But
because overseas guilds kill Statue, AoW is unavailable to FoH. So it would
be interesting to see if any of those overseas guilds ask for piles of loot
in exchange for leaving the server with the /movelog, and what would happen
if the guild that got paid off to leave either didn't leave or did the
/movelog too late to leave.
