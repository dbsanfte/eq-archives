My son would like to know if there are any helpful cheats available for
Everquest. All of the searches we've done point to cheats for other flavors
of Everquest (for example, Lords of Everquest), but not to the original
game. My son would like to get some extra money to sort of get a "jump
start" on the game and buy a weapon or two.  If such cheats are available, a
link would be appreciated. Thanks.
