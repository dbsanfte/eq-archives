Also you only get sitting meditation, you do -not- get sitting HP regen.  Of
course this doesn't matter all that much to most classes, but to necromancers
or shamans it might.

LOY "horse" (drogma) has a very very annoying movement style, like you are
going everywhere on a pogo stick.  Eventually you can get used to it, but when
you buy your first one you'll swear you'll never do anything other than sit
still with it.

Even the drogma yeilds some targetting problems, particularly whenever looking
even the least bit downwards.  Of course bodies to loot are usually under your
feet... but I'm sure you -meant- to target your mount ten times in a row like
that instead of the corpse.

Another problem; no illusions while on your mount.  This means no wolf form, no
imp form, no werewolf form... and for a shaman, no bear form; note that bear
form means HP regen, so its a double whammy, you lose sit HP regen -and- bear
HP regen.

Paax, owned a Drogma for 15 levels before using it for more than a little extra
mana while doing a lot of buffing; 50 shaman, Morel Thule
