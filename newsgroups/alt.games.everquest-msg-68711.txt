It's not cleric, it's not enchanter, and it's not Wizard.. It's Shaman.  The
reason is simple: At higher levels, a monk's tanking ability and AC starts
to slack compared to the damage output of the mobs, and a shaman slowing
cuts down mob damage dramatically.  Sure, you could pair up with a cleric,
but if you're taking full damage, he'll be healing too much and you'll be
waiting for mana all the time.  A cleric with better healing or a druid with
damage shields can't beat the efficiency of slow. :)
