    Congrats! Nice item, sells well.

    Sounds about right on my server. Regen BPs are all the rage these days
since the Fungi drop rate nerf, so most auctioners go the "Taking offers on
Iksar BP" route, but from what I can piece together that's in the ballpark.
(I've been spending some time in EC recently selling Dan's "crap that's
accumulated in my bank account" collection.)

    Aye, they are now that the stream of Fungis is shut down. And ignore
offers - they are always lowball to the point of absurdity. I see a steady
stream of people offering 18 to 20 K for Fungi in EC. The fact that there's
eight people offering, and only one person who is "taking offers" on a
Fungi, should tell them that they're low. If you want to have fun selling
it, go the "taking offers" route - you can have some real fun haggling on
those. If you set a price, no matter what the price, people will knock 20%
off the price and counteroffer so that they can get a 10% discount. So be
sure to inflate the price you auction at by 10% so you can get what you
really wanted in the first place. :-)
