But, we all know that you need to use magic (not fire-based) or blunt
weapons to keep the pelts from being damaged.  Right?  So, take out those
cudgels to beat on the baby seals.  WOuldn't want to ruin that pelt, now,
would we?

No, no... But is does make it more likely to use 2 weapons effectively.  You
have to be dextrous to do that.  Now, if they just had an Ambidexterity
value...

Nope, Agility does that.  Also, being more agile elps you get past mobs
blocks of your hits...

It's just not vetry sanitary.  That's why the new mobs won't come out...

BTW, why do the orcs let their kids play so close to the enemy when the big
guard types stay home?  Does that make sense to anyone?  ("Go on, Little
Morpu, play over there near the Wood Elf chldren.  You'll have fun playing
games with them.  Just run up to them every time you see them and start
whacking them with your fist.  They like that.")
