No.  Guides cannot check reports.  This guide had absolutely no way of 
knowing what the other person said.  You SHOULD turn on your filter; what is 
so hard about that?  If this was my game, swearing would not be a warnable 
offense because there's a filter in the game just so you don't have to see 
it, what a concept, apparently too complex for some people.

I'm glad I read the bottom of this post before the top.  This is a really 
dumb comment.  How anyone can hate unpaid volunteers is beyond me.  You try 
it if you think it's so easy.  These people are taking time out of their 
lives to help, and all they get are whiny, ungrateful people.  Guides have 
rules to follow too, and they aren't psychic and can't look up logs of every 
single event that happens on a server as some people seem to think.
