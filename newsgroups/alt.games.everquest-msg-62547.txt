In the GOOD FAST EXP for 37 warrior CLUB!

There are a lot of places really, crystal caverns, droga, nurga,
overthere, dalnir, great divide, etc and so on. Droga, nurga and
dalnir are incredibly underused and great xp but you have to bring
your own group pretty much. If you go to droga and are LFG the only
other person in the zone will be the guy camping the idol of the
thorned and will be a level 53 - 60 character. 

There is no where really that great in the old world at 37 except
maybe the first part of lower guk, sol a.. possibly solb that low,
cazic thule maybe?
