Weird.. how do you lose something that you have the login and password
for in the divorce? I'd simply get on and change the password then
feign obliviousness.

I'd say don't do it. Its really getting long in the tooth now. It has
changed, but underneath its still the same timesink/outdated game.
Plane of knowledge, of planes of power, means that you can get around
better but its sort of a scam since you'll never see the planes you
bought that expansion for. That is kind of the direction they've gone
in since luclin, some worthless expansions that you mainly buy for one
feature which eventually leaves you feeling like you got duped when
you never get uber enough to enjoy the other features.

Well, in some ways it really IS a newbies game now.
People don't really help you out by giving you stuff, but on an
established server the gear you could buy at level 30 in the bazaar
for pennies would blow your mind (compared to what you used to have.) 

Essentially by saving up the spiderling/spidersilk/low - high quality
animal skins and bone chips that you got by adventuring, you'd be
making good money in the bazaar afk while sleeping or at work. You add
to the drops you get while adventuring by checking out NPC vendors in
passing, finding the same player sold items often in mass quantities
(like the time I bought out one in neriak of 85 spiderling silk..
jeez...)  You find that you can easily make 400 plat a night once you
get the hang of it, just off of NPC shopping and reselling.
