	In the high level game, yes, this is what they do in the main.
However, in the absence of Paladins and Wizards, Clerics are also
handy for stopping spellcasting since they get Stun.  And if there
aren't any nukers in the party and no Necros, SKs, Druids, or Rangers
in the party to cast Snare or Darkness, then I'm all for the Cleric
dropping a big ol' Smite on a fleeing MOB in order to avoid trains.
