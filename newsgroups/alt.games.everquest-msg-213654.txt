1.  Those are PoK books, if you have Planes of Power expansion installed,
clicking on them will teleport you to Plane of Knowledge

2.  I assume you are talking about inspecting other characters, you can turn
inspect off.  /inspect [ON/OFF] - Toggles on and off your ability to inspect
others with a right-click of the mouse.

3.  Not that I know of, but you can just hit the ESC key several times
rather than hitting the CLOSE button on each bag

4.  I think it stops spinning once you hit 100.  Only char that I have SH
over 100 was 200 when they put the compass in, so haven't confirmed yet.
