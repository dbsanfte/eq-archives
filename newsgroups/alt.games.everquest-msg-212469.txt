Not for me, I wasn't around back then.

Admittedly, the fact that he *knew* that in a few hours he'd be up in 
Heaven doing whatever it is that people do there, whiling away the three 
days until he was due back kinda takes the sting out of dying, doesn't 
it? The problem with dying is the uncertainty of what comes after, and 
the finality of it, and if you remove both factors, all that's left is a 
bit of pain and inconvenience. Jesus got off *very* lightly indeed 
compared to others who managed to get on the Romans's bad books, not to 
mention the stuff we get up to in this century.

Well, yeah. The problem is that Omniscience does immediately away with 
all the "mystery" bit.

Yup. Mostly, search for someone to inflict them on, if history is 
anything to go by.

I think you haven't got your head around the full implications of 
Omnipotence yet. It's not about wiping out the rebellion with a wave of 
a hand, it's about the rebellion being not only *undone*, but *never so 
much as dreamed of* in the mind of Lucifer with so little as a simple 
thought on god's part. Nature isn't corrupted... I'm afraid nature is 
very much working every bit as intended.
