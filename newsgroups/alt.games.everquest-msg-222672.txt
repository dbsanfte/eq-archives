Sorry; it's my fault.  I asked Ngreth last week about RackNine (their host),
and he said that the servers are sound.  Next thing y'know, PFFT!  I gotta
stop doing that.

Seriously, I haven't been able to get to it in days.  I'm not sure why it's
down right now, but I know Niami is close to the fires in SoCal.  Last I
heard she was safe from the fires themselves, but not the smoke.  She's my
guildmistress; I'll try to get the official word from someone in the guild
to pass on.
