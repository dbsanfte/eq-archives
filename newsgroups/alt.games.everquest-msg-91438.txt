And the outrageous amount of damage they can do, or the fact that the most
soloable classes in the game are casters?  Sorry, I've got no pitty.  If a
caster is needing high hp, defence, and AC, he needs to figure out how to
play his class.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
