hmmm that subject line should scare the EQ people off.

Anyway, got someone here threatening to buy me the game if I don't buy 
it for myself.

And I have a question:

Do the cat people have pants?
http://nekobox.org/cgi-bin/comicrant.cgi?date=2004-02-25

This would be an important innovation to my current gameplay experience.

Especially as I'd be running a male cat person. Assuming I made a cat 
person. Which I might. Or might not. I might just pick a race at random 
again.
But I'd hate to get stuck without pants. Again.
