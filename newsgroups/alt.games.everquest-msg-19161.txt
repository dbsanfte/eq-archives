<shrug>  Yes.  You're right of course.  It's just...

Caitlyn is a cleric.  A level 52 cleric.  And she's nice to everyone.
Even the crappy little level 2 beggars who follow her around and beg for
power leveling, buffs, rezzes (why the hell do you need a rez at level
2??) everything.  She's nice to everyone.  She has never made an enemy.
She doesn't have a lot of wealth... she's not wearing just outrageous
gear.  I can't think of any reason why anyone would WANT to hack her.
Why not hack the level 60 cleric, or the level 60 enchanter, or someone
actually worth your while to hack.  Why target me?  Why bother?

I never in my wildest dreams thought that someone would guess my
password, or that they would even bother to try.
