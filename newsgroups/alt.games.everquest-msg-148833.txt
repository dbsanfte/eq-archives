Those engineering companies don't have a force of full-time CS reps
and the massive server farms to keep up that Verant does.

Fix the ones you can, work around the ones you can't, leave the ones
you can't even work around to simmer on the back burner until an
answer is found (Like the recent fix on the GD zone crashin).

Food is slightly more critical than a game. But, yes, I do call about
it. I get a good response. I'm happy. No, the pizza place doesn't give
me the "too bad" line. Then again, Verant has never given that line
either...

The vast majority of the problems that guides and GMs deal with have
to do with problems between players. They're glorified babysitters for
the most part.
