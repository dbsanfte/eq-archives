Atone is very flaky. There is no message telling you whether or not
it actually succeeded, and most often it does not unless the mob is
deep green. Rooting is a tried and true ghetto CC tactic of course.

If you want to use Atone, so sense in wasting a spell gem on it.
Water Sprinkler of the Forgiven has right-click Atone, albeit a
long cast time (9 sec I think), and is dirt cheap in the bazaar.
