No, she wasn't a guy, but your cynicism is duly noted.

And as for the sex being waved in front of my nose, it was at first, and I
waved it for her, I mentioned that.  But later on, I no longer had the urge
to engage in cyber sex with her.  It became a chore instead of being fun.  I
informed her I wanted to group with her and play the damned game still
sometime, but she evidently didn't feel the same way.  What happened was I
still cared about her, about her damned life problems, and I couldn't stop
caring.  THAT was my downfall, not the carrot.

The confrontation with her husband served to have me stop caring.  It was
"skin crawling", as one poster put it, but it served its purpose.  And
though it wasn't my judgement to make perhaps, her husband did need to know
what she has been up to.  Look at it this way:  She couldn't communicate her
thoughts to him, so someone intervened in the end.
