Almost on topic - I bought a 10 dose SoW potion the other day to use
in emergencies.  The emergency came and I ran whilst taking the
potion..... I got the message that my spell was interupted.  :-( 
Needless to say that I died shortly after (it was an emergency after
all)

I'd have thought that you could glug a potion on the run ok.  At least
it didn't use one of the charges though.  What it does mean though is
that I can't use the potion as I intended.  I wanted to use it almost
as a get out of jail free card.  When I'm getting low on hitpoints and
am being beaten on by my charmed pet - run and glug the potion to get
away.  I'll have to panic a bit sooner and glug and then run.  Not
quite as useful because I'll have to anticipate the problem and in
some instances I'll probably use it when I didn't need to.  I'm very
short on cash and I cannot really afford to waste SoW potions.  :-(
