Hardly.

What I am is a lurker who loves to read bizbee flames and hates those that
"want to be bizbee"...  While he's just a kook his followers are just
pathetic.

bizbee is a funny as Hell Usenet stalker, google boy, while the wannabees
are just boring as Hell.

Now go read one of bizbees' whines that's five paragraphs long detailing how
stupid he was for not reading the supernews FAQ before he signed-up.

Then read his nervous lap dogs follow-ups.  They fear him and he loves that.
Lok was afraid of bizbee and behaved like a nervous poodle pissing a puddle
on the floor every time he came into the room.
