Ask your new host. It should be trivial for them to set up.

Imagine you register the domain tobidomain.com. Every prefix,
including www, ftp, eq, etc. are subdomains. In this respect, these
all function the same way.

I would expect that if you told your new host what you wanted to do
there wouldn't be an additional setup fee, though there might be if
you make changes down the road. However, you'll have to call around
and see.

godaddy.com is pretty cheap for registering domains.
