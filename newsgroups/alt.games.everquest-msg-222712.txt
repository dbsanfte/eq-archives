If you get bored with EQ, you're making yourself be bored. You're
probably too focused on advancing.

Try getting a few people interested in some fun together and head for
a dungeon that's a little out of your (level) reach. Sure you'll
probably all die (repeatedly), but doing that kind of thing is the
most fun I've had.

Or go explore by yourself. Somewhere you've never been.

Or go to your hometown and try to aggro every guard you can see.

Or pick up a new tradeskill. Or go buff newbies. Or make jokes in POK.
Or browse the bazaar. Or find new people to chat with. Or take of all
your equipment and go streaking across Karana. Or go buy some
fireworks and put up a show. Or go help a newbie. Or start a new
character... or....

Don't take it so serious. You might have a lot of fun doing something
that doesn't advance your character per se.
