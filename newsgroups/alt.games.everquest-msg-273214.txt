Ok this happened just a min ago. I had 954 status points in the guild 
window. as I finished my last writ and should have rolled over to 1000 
suddenly my points dissapeared and the guild lost the xp on the bar. Someone 
said this was due to a rollover problem. Has anyone else had this problem?

I have petitioned customer service.
