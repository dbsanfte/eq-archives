This is a new one and could be a problem from an outside source. Run a
virus scan. Run AdAware or some other scumware-searching tool. If
you've changed any drivers around the time you noticed the change,
revert to the old ones if possible. Have you installed any new
software recently? Make sure nothing unnecessary is running in the
background, too.

I do not think witchcraft is a religion, and I do not think it is in any 
way appropriate for the U.S. military to promote it.

-- George W. Bush, October 15, 2000 

(Notice how Bush does away with the Wiccan's right to religious liberty
by redefining Wicca as not a religion and further denigrating it with 
the term witchcraft.)
