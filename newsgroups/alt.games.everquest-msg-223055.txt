Man, if you call that bitching, how do you survive around here. In
context, that was meant as a comment re: what other important issues
went unfixed, not in relation to the con text color issue. The one does
not relate to the other as I do not use the con ring. I have no problems
at all with them adding these kinds of things, provided current issues
are addressed first and foremost.

You've made it eminently clear you like the ring. FINE! I prefer another
method and turned off that feature immediately. I just wish it would
stay off. It doesn't for me. I have to turn it off again at the
beginning of each session.

Now, turning to the con text color issue, you had a resolution already
in place to your issue of the text being too dark. You could have
lightened the shade of the background color. My "bitch" is that I wasn't
afforded that courtesy with the shade of the text itself. No matter what
I do with the background shade, there is no difference in shade/contrast
between light blue and dark blue cons given the way my eyes see shades
of blue.
