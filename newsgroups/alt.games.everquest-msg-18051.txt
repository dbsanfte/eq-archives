There is no class which is "better" in any absolute way. Verant has actually
made a mostly successful effort to keep the classes balanced. The only way a
druid or cleric would be "better" is if the class better fits in with your
playing style.

Druids: Great soloers, foragers. Able to teleport self and eventually
groups. Master of the damage shields. Some nice buffs. Decent healers and
curers. Not much in demand for groups except for damage shields, teleports
and the wolf spells (spirit of wolf, group wolf form), although harmony is
in great demand at lower levels.

Clerics: Lousy soloers and after about 9th level, they are pretty much group
dependent. Master physicians, they can heal and cure at 5 levels ahead of
druids and shaman. The only class that can ressurect characters; at higher
level they can nullify the experience penalty of dying. ALWAYS in demand in
groups, although you will probably get yelled at if you try to do anything
other than meditate/heal.
