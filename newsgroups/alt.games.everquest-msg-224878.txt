Another one for the group:

I have used and am using a custom UI but I have never used two different
UI's on two different characters.  I am thinking that the way it is done
that the specific UI assigned to a character stays with that character,
however I'm not sure.  Is this the way it works or does the last UI used
carry over to the next character and have to be reset?  No biggie since it's
easy to switch but was just curious.


Thanks.
