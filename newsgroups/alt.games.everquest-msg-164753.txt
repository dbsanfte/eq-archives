Hmmm...you might be better off playing many different games, to low/mid
level, instead of going all the way in one.  With AC and DAoC and AO out
now, and SWG and AC2 coming up (or is AC2 out already?), you could have many
months worth of things to explore.  The problem with exploring in a single
game (all of them, as far as I've seen, not just EQ), is that you reach a
point where to explore more, you need to be able to survive areas that are
very dangerous, and that requires reaching high level.  In all these games,
leveling is faster at low level, and so you can fairly quickly reach a level
where you can explore quite a bit.  (And don't overlook the single player
games...some of them have big interesting worlds to explore).
