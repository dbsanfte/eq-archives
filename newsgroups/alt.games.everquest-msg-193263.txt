I was just watching a movie called "the Ring" for the first time. I believe
that whatever person or consortium is responsible for this film, is also
responsible for these in full or in part. The scary thing is that in some of
these films there are relics in my parent's house shown, in Vulgar there is
a picture on the wall of a character in a story I wrote long ago.

Vulgar
The Core
XXX
The Satan's Legions
Riverworld

I get the feeling this person doesn't want to be known, possibly because of
me, possibly because he knew all along that I was a prophet because he is
one too.

Perhaps him and I are the 2 endtime prophets? Seems reasonable to me.

God is currently trying to save me from myself, and it would appear he is
succeeding although he tells me I am evil, but I will get better over time
as long as I follow him.

He has shown me what Hell is like, at least the nicer parts, and you do not
want to go there unless you want to carry an eternal burden alone in the
dark. Proclaiming yourself as a prophet is not something that should be
taken lightly or blithely wished for. While you are being a prophet you are
missing out on life, but you have to do what God wants and if he wants you
to do it, then you must do it.

There are only three more things I must do, then hopefully I will be free,
God has healed me of most of the afflictions and inner demons that screwed
up much of the first 28 years of my life.

The first is to write two more posts, then I have some travelling to do,
then perhaps the curse will finally be lifted and I can try to lead a more
normal existence
