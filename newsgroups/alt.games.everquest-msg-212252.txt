And may I say, as one of the group members for that crawl, that I had
an absolute blast!  XP wasn't too bad for me (but I'm only 61 versus
your 65) and it was so much fun, up until a certain tall, dark, and
really really ugly shadowknight and I went to Justice in search of
some doodad he needed, and were killed by an veritable FLOOD of
rats...well that was fun too actually, excluding the need to look at
him naked...  ;-)
