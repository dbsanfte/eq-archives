well i got my computer back today from a repair guy lol.  but my eq
problems started way back during a late may or early june patch.  i
started crashing to desktop.  a grey box would pop up saying "we have
detected that your client has crashed and you will be booted to
desktop yada yada click yes to send info"

bios motherbard dx9c 56.72 drivers for geforce 5200 video card all
that is updated, and with a new reformat.  was in tech support with
soe for over a month with them giving up and me wondering why i still
pay for a game i haven't been able to play.  i can crash at any point
after hitting the character select screen, though usually in game
since i'm at the computer to select a character.  but between 15
seconds and a rare couple of hours, though usually much closer to the
15 seconds as what happened after installing and patching the game
today.  really unsure what to do or what to type here lol.  any help
i'd like, and i have no extra money ;-)
