Just reporting a bit of success for those that may be grappling with
non-existant Luclin performance and trying to weigh up whether to upgrade: I
just threw a Gforce3 Titanium 200 64mb DDR graphics card (Leadtek) in and
Luclin absolutely purrs like the good little kitty it should : )

The Geforce 3 replaces a Geforce 2 32mb SDRAM (Asus V7100) that was proving
to be a real choke point with everything turned on, clipping plane out and
textures up high on 1024 x 768. the main problem previously was spell
effects would almost completely lock the graphics till completed, crawling
framerates with loot window open and "frame skips" when approaching area of
new textures (which is a real PITA if turning). The performance was even
lacklustre with spell effects off and textures set to medium...

Now everything is razor sharp again and I can't even force it to skip a
beat..... *grins stupidly*

Rest of the system is the same as before:

Athlon 1.2 Gig
Asus A7V133 MB
768mb pc133 ram
SB Audigy
Dual W2K and XP
