Um, you're using the mouse to activate your hotkeys?

Try using the keyboard shortcuts for the hotkeys.  By
default, it's simply "1" for hotkey #1, "2" for #2, etc.

As an added bonus, you won't have to worry about framerate lag
making your mouse pointer slow/choppy when you're trying
to hit a hotkey *fast* in an emergency.

Most EQ actions have keyboard shortcut equivalents, and
once you learn them allow for almost instantaneous 
response time to various situations (whereas mouseclicking
has an unavoidable lag due to 1) visually locate the mouse
pointer on the screen, which can be a problem with lots
of spell effects flashing and so on, 2) move the mouse
pointer over to what you need to click and 3) click on it.)
