    It's funny you should mention FG. The first reaction of one of our guild
paladins to the enhanced level range was, "Damn. FG will still be light
blue." That place is one of the most mind-numbing places I can imagine - but
he'd be there in a flash if he could rack up AA points at a reasonable pace
on his own time.

    You'll still be able to buy them in The Bazaar. With the elemental
planes emptying out as fast as they do, lots of Tier III bosses still get
killed and they drop spectrals as well as runes.
