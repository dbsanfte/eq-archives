They are regular ports now, cast it from anywhere. They were terrible
as evacs because you will see where they drop you can be as dangerous
as the dungeon you were escaping. Not to mention it makes it easier to
reach other zones and allows people to spread out a little more
without having to port to DL, run to the dungeon there, then port out
again.

They don't drop. The druid vendors in FV sell them. The druid vendors
can be found behind the bank by the water. There are two huts sitting
on a small pier over the water with a half-elf female outside the
door.
