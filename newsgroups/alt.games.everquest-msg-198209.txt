In the "uifiles" sub-directory of your everquest installation
directory (the default is "c:\Everquest\uifiles") create a new
sub-directory with a name you like (ex: "myui").  Copy the
file "EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml" from "...\uifiles\default" to
your newly created "..\uifiles\myui".  Edit this copy (Notepad
works fine for this), go down near the bottom of the file and
delete the lines:
    <Pieces>Player_HPLabel</Pieces>
    <Pieces>Player_HPPercLabel</Pieces>
save the file.  When you run EQ use the command:
/loadskin myui 1
(the last character is the numeral '1') (substitute whatever name
you used for the new sub-directory for "myui") to load your new
custom UI, which will be identical to thedefault except for not
having the HP% counter.

WARNINGS:
(1) don't edit the .xml file in "default", it will just be patched
over when you start EQ.
(2) take care not to delete any other lines in the file, results
might not be pleasant
(3) "myui" (or whatever) must be under uifiles
(4) if you use something other than Notepad to edit the file, take
care that it saves the file as plain text and that it doesn't
change the file name or extension.
