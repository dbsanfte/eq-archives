}>So even you admit that it was not "exactly meant for" penis waving, but

}Apparently you have no idea what "exactly meant for" means, either.
}The channel is meant to catch the very sort of things the people werre
}talking about. What about that don't you understand? English not your
}first, second, or third language?

}>Oh very good, throw in a few catch phrases and maybe the fact that you

}No, it doesn't mean exclusivity at all. So your excuse is you don't
}understand English. I'll remember that. *sigh*
}Person 1: They're skating on ice!
}Person 2: Of course, that's exactly what its there for.
}Twohead: You idiot! Exactly means exclusively! Ice has other uses
}besides being skated on!
}Everyone else: /laugh at Twohead
}Don't worry, no apology is expected, despite it definately being

This argument is amusing and all, but could you boys take it to /tells? :)

Exactly can mean exclusively.  On the other hand, it may not.  But if it 
should satisfy th at all, Ben has here misspelled 'definitely'.  It is in 
fact the WRONG spelling.  So he's WRONG. WRONG WRONG WRONG!  Happy?
