They play EQ because they hang on to what is familiar 
in the face of zero competition.
This probably won't be a wise design to bank on in the
post EQ era.

A lot less people would play EQ if it was still only old EQ. This is
why static is a bad choice, they have to keep on making up an entire
new world every six months to keep players around. Eventually you
exhaust all the old content and are only doing the new content. So
static is not designing for the future, rather it is designing to have
to make an addition in six months.

Since the latest additions have alienated me and I really can't use
them, I feel that I've exhausted the content in the game. Luclin was
really the last "run arond from level one to 65 exploring and doing
stuff!" expansion. I still don't know about this next expansion, it
also might leave me in the cold.

Since I am currently left in the cold by the new stuff, the staticness
of the old stuff is more of a problem. It just becomes boring to do
and be in the same old areas. The entire game becomes like those two
orc camps in the east commons which have been there since the beta,
mostly unchanged. Eventually you no longer log into EQ wanting to go
hang around one of those orc camps.
