Not real rare, but in the week+ I've been down there, I'd say that
once very 2 hours or so might be about par.

It helps to clear everything in the "stables" and the halls that
they run along.  There's a big "loop" around the Stable area,
but ignore the two long "roomless" sides, just clear the
two halls that make up the two sides which have the "stable"
rooms (north and east halls, the ones with annotations 1, 2,
and 3 on the eqatlas.com map of the Kurn's basement).

The Thickboneds can spawn anywhere along there, so clearing all
mobs there will give them more opportunities to spawn.

Hell, that's always good preparation no matter how long or short
the spawn might be.
