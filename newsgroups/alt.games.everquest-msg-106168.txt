I have personally. I'm a 56 druid and my guild knows what a goddess I
am. It is a fact that on many raids of big mobs, where we use a CH
heal chain (so that is all the clerics are doing) that the druids also
spam healing save the day, as well as saving occasional enchanters or
wizards they are grouped with who might get hit sometimes. I'm a
positive boon to my guild and they want me and the other 8 or 9 (more
than many other classes) druids who show up. They want us because
whether or not we can do something that well, we by Tunare( or karana)
get it done. We ARE the swiss army knife of EQ, but just like a real
swiss army knife we might just save your ass one day. Though I am a
druid I've been called one of the "best healers they've grouped with"
by people in my guild like enchanters, cause I get it done and I save
their ass even if my spells are not the best for doing it. That cleric
may not be fast enough to get off that small fast heal on them, but
they know that I'm going to step up with my chloroblast and get it
done even if I'm NOT grouped with them. Our druid class is closed,
because the 8 or 9 who show up to EVERY raid are all that is needed,
BECAUSE WE KICK ALL ASS.

I think the druid class totally kicks ass. They kick it the most from
1 - 50 and 51 - 60 they kick it as much as the possibly can with the
game still having any semblance of "balance." We rock the house and no
matter what a bunch of whiney druids try to say in some 1400 post to
verant to the contrary, I'd not change a single thing. So we are not
welcome in the level 60 AOE group which has better AOE classes in it,
we also were preferred by nearly every group from level 1 - 55 INSTEAD
of the wizard who finally has a coveted place in that AOE group. So we
don't get a group heal, god, if we did get a group heal we WOULD be
about the best class in the game. Currently a paladin is welcome at
high level in certain kinds of groups as the a tank because he has a
group heal (the new cazic is such a place, due to how the mobs behave)
I'd rather not get a group heal or phenomenal AOE power and not step
on the wizard's  or paladin's toes. They EARNED it while we had the
easy route.

We got the trade off. The trade off was being able to do it alone,
WELL, from 14 - 60. We could do it ALL. The one area we are not as
needed for is some high level particular niche groups. In the meantime
we enjoyed one of the best niches in the game. This is called
"balance", and the druid class may be one of the one examples of
something well balanced in the whole game.
