Even though I do see your point I can't think of a solution to this
problem. I mean the rate at which someone progresses in the game is
bound to his online time. Just out of this simple fact there are people
which "race" throuhg the levels and others who slowly walk behind. You
can't level this difference. In fact you mustn't do that. Same problem
is with newcomers. I began with EQ in december 2002. Everything except
PoTime has been beaten already iirc. I could have leveled my char up to
65 and grind whatever AAs necessary to join such a guild. Instead I've
chosen to adventure all over Norrath. Right now I'm in a small guild
which raids quite often. And our current "unbeatable" Mob is AoW and
Shei Vinitras. Sure they have been beaten by others. But we can and will
learn the strategies. Granted I doubt we will ever set foot into Vex
Thal or Elemental Planes. We just don't have the numbers. But it's
nothing that bothers me. We try to go as far as we can. And I would be
really annoyed if we could just walk through the planes up to time and
beat quarm. I'm content were I'm now. Even if it means Velious level and
start of Luclin.
