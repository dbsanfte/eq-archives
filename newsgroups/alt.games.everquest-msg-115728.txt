There was a system wide message about today beginning a Week of War.  I
imagine this is some sort of in game event, hosted by the GM's, but has this
happened before?  Any idea what this is?  And where should I be so I don't
miss out on it?  I just ported up to Luclin with my Monk and hunting in
Paludal Caverns, I don't want to miss my first in game event that I've seen
or heard about, so where should I go?
