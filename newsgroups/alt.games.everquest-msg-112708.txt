Actually, for an enchanter(ress), coming up short on spell money early
on isn't too surprising if you don't know how to make the money.
Enchanters get more spells per "circle" than any other class...

Hunt black/brown bears and hope for HQ pelts. They're rare, but they
sell for 20-35p, depending on server. Another couple levels and you
can slip into an orc group if you're near Freeport and sell the belts,
usually around 1p a pop. If you're in GFay, then it's Crushbone, those
belts are the same rate. Bone chips and bat wings can go for up to 5pp
per stack (sometimes someone will offer more), so bop all those
decaying skeles and bats. All these can be learned by paying attention
to the auction channel in newbie zones...

General tip during your lowbie days, especially if you're soloing,
collect EVERYTHING the mobs drop that you can carry and sell it all to
merchants if players (All that players aren't interested in, anyway).

Once you learn these things, there is no reason to ever come up short
on spell money.
