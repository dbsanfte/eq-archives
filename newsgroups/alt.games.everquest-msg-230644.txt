Very true. My new hot spot to solo is Ahkeva Ruins. Unless Da 'Vynn or 
some raid target has popped, I find that it's basically empty all of the 
time, save the odd folks looking for shards for their VT keys once in a 
while, and they hunt in a different area than I do. It's a great zone 
that stays dark blue to at least 62, and either soloing my wizard, or 
duoing with the wife's necro it's easy meat for xp. Plus you can pick up 
a ton of higher end tradeskill items which all stack, either to use or 
to put up on the bazaar.
