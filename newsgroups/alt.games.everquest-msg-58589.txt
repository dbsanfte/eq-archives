As you get higher leveled, you'll find three things to be constant:

1.  Nukes/Dots are VERY poor damage generators and cause very high
downtime.

2.  Enchanter nukes/dots piss off mobs in a way that has to be seen to
be believed.  A resisted Anarchy will out aggro a full damage
Sunstrike, and I'm not exaggerating too much about that.

3.  You last about 6 seconds against any blue con mob when it decides
to beat the piss outta you for nuking/dots it.  Less if it's a raid
caliber type mob (more like 0.5 seconds as the first swing + flurry
will tear your head off).

Enjoy it.
Because later on, it'll be the bane of your existence.  That
unresistable neg 30+ MR tends to piss off things tremendously.  Of
course, if you slow and cripple on top of that...well, that's why they
give you memblur right?  :)
