go agnostic, but go straight to FP.  to be able to travel in OT trouble free
is something i wish i could have done!!

don't worry about the sash quests, do them later when your high enough to
just solo the orc camps with ease... i tried to do the sash quests at about
level 35, for some reason he wouldn't let me start the first sash tho (you
need to do each 1 in order)

so i just went and killed Brother Z for the robe... and he dropped the red
sash too lol (useless at my level)
