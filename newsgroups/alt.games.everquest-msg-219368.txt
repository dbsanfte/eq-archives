Nobody said abaondon it. I agree its the best we've got. (Although the 
US implementation of it isn't even as good as the Canadian or British 
versions, imo) But we can have democracy without delegating to 
governments tasks they are wholly inequipped and unsuitable for.

true. But fair is relative. Its even less fair for society to tell me i 
can't have kids because a corrupted ineffective bureacracy said so.

Its sort of like justice... I'd rather err on the side of the criminal 
than punish the innocent.

Except in this case, government doesn't need to get involved, and when 
government isn't needed, then government shouldn't be used.

I strongly beleive the Government is not suitable to decide who gets to 
reproduce.
