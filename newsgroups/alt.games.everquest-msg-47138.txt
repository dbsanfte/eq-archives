    Heh. You do realize that killing a mob that gives less XP for more
effort is sort of silly if your goal is levelling, right?

    As for the "too scared to take risk" part, I imagine he's referring to
how easy it is to escape a bad situation outdoors compared with in a
dungeon. In a dungeon like Sebilis (same level range), training to zone
isn't an option in most camps. You deal with what comes at you and you
either die and CR, overcome what attacks, or evac and start again. Outdoors,
if things turn south you run to zone at SoW speed from a mob that may be
snared, or you might even Fear/Root the thing and go zone to clear aggro.
Big difference in risk factors.
