Mythic did a DAoC patch this morning, and screwed something up, so had
to do an emergency patch.  Then *THAT* needed one.  Some or all of
these involved rolling everything back to just before the patch, so
people that played between the emergency patches lost any experience
they earned between patches.

That's Mythic pulling a Verant.

Now here's Mythic pulling an anti-Verant:

"As our way of saying 'Doh, our bad, sorry we had to take it down
three times today (and possibly cause some experience loss due to
rollbacks and resets),' every character who logs in after the patch
will receive roughly the following: Level one characters will see no
benefit (since this morning's Musical Servers didn't impact them),
levels 2-10 are getting about a bubble of experience, and experience
roughly equivalent to twenty yellow solo kills to all other
characters."

(Yellows in DAoC are about equivalent to even cons in EQ).

It worked out to almost 3 DAoC bubbles for my level 21 healer, which
is equivalent to 1.5 yellow EQ bubbles (there are 10 bubbles per level
in DAoC and 5 in EQ).
