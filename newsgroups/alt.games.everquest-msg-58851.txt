  It's because a melee class's effectiveness is much more heavily influenced
by gear than is caster effectiveness.  All a caster can really do is make
their mana tank bigger by boosting their mana stat.  A bigger mana tank is
nice, but it doesn't dramatically improve your level of power in terms of
how many kills per minute you can carry out.  You still recover mana at the
same rate no matter what your intelligence or wisdom.  They can boost their
AC, yeah... but they're probably not taking very many hits, especially if
they group, or if they kite, or if they let their pet tank (which are the
tactics used by most caster classes).  They can boost their resistences, but
there aren't a lot of low level casting mobs, so what's the point?

  Melee classes, on the other hand... well, they melee, and there is a ton
of great AC items out there that a level 5 character can wear just as easily
as a level 45 character, as well as weapons with insane damage/delay ratios
that lower level characters can use effectively.  Tank AC and damage output
has a LOT more impact on their overall effectiveness and their "kill per
minute" ratio than a bigger mana tank for a caster does.

  There's nothing really wrong with it, except it diminishes the challenge
of the game.  How much challenge a person wants to take on is up to them, I
don't really care.  I just don't like it that lots of items you see on a
twinked character could have been sold for a reasonable price to somebody's
main, and it's possible that somebody's main didn't get that item in the
first place because of a high level farmer/twinker.
