Yup - Me. I am using a tnt2 ultra card with win 98.  I did notice that
the problem didn't exist in the old world.  I was able to play for
hours on end in Halas, everfrost and Qeynos but as soon as I went to
POK or the Bazaar or PC or Shadow Haven BANG.  Ususally, I couldn't
make it from one portal to another.  Or on logon, I'd summon a pet and
buff it then bye bye.  I wasn't having this problem prior to that and
nothing changed on my machine.  Couldn't find anything at Sony but
there were a number of people complaining about similar problems in
the general chat room.
