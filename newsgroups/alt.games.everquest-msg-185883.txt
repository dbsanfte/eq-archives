Keep petitioning. Every time you log in, do a /viewpetition, that show 
if your petition are still there. If its gone, petition again, mention 
the guides names and when you were in contact with them, and if 
possible, what gear you lost.
Also head over to the official EQ page and use the Contact your GM 
feature to send them a mail too.
Then you start waiting. Personally i lost 3 items recently from logging 
out while they were in a no rent bag (yes, i know, my own fault, but got 
them back :)), petitioned friday at 22.00 my time, around midnight my 
time a guide contacted me and said he would bump it to the GM that had 
the smallest job list. MONDAY night i got a tell from that guide 
(appearantly the job list werent that small), but i were AFK for the 
night and on my mule by then. Kept petitioning and talked to 2 more 
guides, before the original GM finally contacted me on friday while i 
were still awake, and i got my stuff back. But took a week, 3 guides and 
1 GM.
