Iv'e used the fearkite quite easily in PoD. Problem is that mobs at 55+ cant
be
feared, so some mobs in PoD, lige pestilent rats (well, some of them) and
lightcrawlers will have to be either root-rotted or agrokited. I prefer to
agrokite
them, since the pet DPS really helps, and root (and its resists) is more
expensive
than the mana lost due to not beeing able to med as much, ime.

Since the 55+ no fear thing is a fact, Tier 2 will be a problem for the
fearkite. I
have yet to get my mark of execution, but will try out the PoS frogs when i
get it. I
expect that I have to agrokite them. A wizzie from my guild has no problems
soloing
them in a standard wizzie kite, but there might be more uberness on him to
make a
fair comparison to my rather average equipment.... but then again, im a
necro ;)
