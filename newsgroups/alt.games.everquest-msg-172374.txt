That's why NBG is doomed in pickup groups... You really don't have any 
way to know (short of inspecting) whether any given item is an upgrade. 
And of course, if you know that a valuable item that's not an upgrade 
for you drops in a certain camp, you can temporarily replace your 
current item with one inferior to the one that drops (in case you get 
inspected), and claim NBG.

NBG should be the standard in guilds and groups of friends, but it's 
simply not practical in pickup groups, and as someone else pointed out, 
the ease with which the Bazaar converts items to cash makes it even 
harder to justify.
