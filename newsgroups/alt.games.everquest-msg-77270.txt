I usually let mob agro on tank a little bit then tash, slow. But I guess
we're talking about the differences between lvl 20ish fights compared to
high end, and you gotta act a bit quicker.

Sadly, only one half so far. I haven't as yet done research, so how does it
work? What I'm more concerned about is if I use the skill, does it have a
chance of failing, and if so, will I lose the component parts, so perhaps
should get skill up 1st ?

ps. Np with the rambling, I'm lapping it up, and thx to Paul also for the
intersting info.
