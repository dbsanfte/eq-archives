In my experiences .. "what [words in brackets]" works for a lot of things.
If they're asking if you will do something, "i will [words in brackets]" ..
If they're asking if you are something, "i am [words in brackets]" .. So if
NPC002 asks "Hey, have you heard about the [plague in the Karanas]?",
working replies could be "what plague in the Karanas", "What is this plague
in the Karanas that you speak of, sir?" and so on ..

VI did a decent job of allowing people to roleplay with NPCs (why??) but
still leaves the option of just using the basic key words. Hell, you could
type an entire paragraph talking to the NPC about [gnolls] and he'd still
talk to you if you used the right keywords in the right places. ;)
