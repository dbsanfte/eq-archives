And replaces it more often than not with the stupidity and/or bias of
your officers sadly.

I'm a Rogue!  I've been in this guild SEVEN weeks godammit, give me MY
Ifir... What? No? He has way more points because he's been in the
guild since 1999? Bah... /deguild.  *chuckle*

Mmm.  ATK + mana regen + nuke focus plus godly stats.  I bet he'd have
used that a lot more often than you'd think as high end Ranger (ie:

time (/snicker) his BoT is probably nothing more than a decent range
item.
