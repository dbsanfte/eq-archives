Well, I decided to send for this, saves me getting off-line when I need to
check something out that I'm usure of. It duely arrived this morning and I
eargerly opened the nice packaging and turned directly to the the Grey,
which is where I've been hunting recently. Lo and behold, what do I find?
Yes, an error! It lists that the only zones available from within the Grey
are Mons Letalis and Ssra Temple - there's no mention at all of Scarlet
Desert. Wonder how many maps are incorrect?

Stevie.
