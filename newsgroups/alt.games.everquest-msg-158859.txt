You know, this would be handy in general, not just high end.

One term that seems to have popped up since I was last playing is "toon".
In Jaggedpine last nigh, someone /ooc'd a question about where all the
vendors were, and got an answer like "Some toons touch off a village war and
didn't defend them".

I get some answers from my guilds, for instance I didn't know what KEI was,
and they enlightened me.  Still, I feel guilty garbaging up /gu with my
questions every time I leave the game for a few months.
