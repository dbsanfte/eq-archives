I've been thinking that I may want to try a different race and class. I'm
still experimenting with EQ and quickly playing a few up to LV10 or so to
see which feel I like the best. I would rather be a middle sized race since
armor and other items are easiest to find that way, and most areas seam to
be centered towards middle sizes (about half the races are middle size).
    I'm wanting one that is good for a warrior. I seam to like warriors even
though they take a long time to heal when soloing. I like the HP and
strength of Ogres, but I just don't like the KOS to everybody good and the
size makes it harder for them to go adventure in some places, and harder to
find armor to fit them. Dwarf and Halfling and Gnome are good, but again
small is hard to find too (try finding HQ wolf skin, and I doubt someone
will use a HQ bear pelt to attempt leather armor with). I also would like to
be a warrior because I'd like to wear plate armor, and I also like the way
the armor looks better on middle sized classes. Iksars can be pretty cool
but again you've got the KOS issue, only at its worst.
    What is a good medium sized race to start, and what would be some good
stats for a warrior of that class (where to put most points into, I've
noticed that some people's suggestions which often sound better go against
some of the main web sites)?
