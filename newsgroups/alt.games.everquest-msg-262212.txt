I installed SP2 on both of the XP Pro machines that I use for EverQuest Live 
and experienced no problems connecting to any of the game or chat servers, 
whether the new firewall was turned on (which it is by default) or off. 
Since I have a hardware firewall, I elected to turn the XP firewall off. So 
far, SP2 has been invisible and transparent to my play.
