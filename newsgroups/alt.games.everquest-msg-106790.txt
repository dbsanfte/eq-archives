<snip good things about GMs>

I've found that as long as you're not a flaming imbecile or using d00dsp34k,
GM's will more often help you than not, and for crippling things like being
under the world or stuck in a death loop or something (or being corpse
camped by a nasty train) they have fairly good response times.

I'd guess that a lot of times when people complain that it takes 3 hours for
a GM to answer their petition, what they fail to mention is that it's 3 am
and there aren't any on!  Or that they're petitioning "omg soandso is a
dick! he ksed my orc!"
