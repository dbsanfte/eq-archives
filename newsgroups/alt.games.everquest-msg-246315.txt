We finally took our 10k+ pally out of the group lineup in Ikkinz trials and
put in a 2nd Cleric to accompany our Warrior. The Shaman of course had to
go, too. No point to having a Shaman in Ikkinz trials. These changes were
required at the upper levels of GoD and it looks like SOE got the message.

Still, I totally feel for the Warrior response at how long it took Knights
to get heard on this relative to Warrior complaints over the years.

Of course, Shamans are still looking for love. I may go back to EverQuest
sometime to check these changes out if my interest in CoH wanes enough. But
I gave up on GoD after banging my head against the brick wall of Ikkinz
Trials too many nights in a row...
