Granted. However, we're not just talking about blowing off a little steam 
here. We're talking about trying to make a case that SoE is a crap company 
peddling crap products and services, and that the prospective subscriber 
should be strongly urged to look elsewhere for their online gaming 
entertainment. That is simply not true.

People have every right to complain about the downtime. They're just 
playing the malcontent when they try to define SoE and EQ2 or Blizzard and 
WoW as steaming piles because of an uncommonly long outtage incident.
