Exactly.  Had he at least managed to be a bit creative I would probably
have read the remainder of his moderately long post.  As it is, his
opening served to announce that he was a mindless partisan sheep
parrotting the same tired old insults that his fellow travellers have
been repeating across uncounted years of kneejerk bickering.  Note
that this behavior is <not> restricted to the right-side of the
political aisle.  Personally I'd count an awful lot of Greens, for
instance, as his fellow travellers.

Not to criticize, but isn't "Free Thinking Registered Independant"
a bit of an oxymoron?
