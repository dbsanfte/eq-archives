Very true - when you go to a dragon raid you see people wearing all sorts 
of crap, just for the raid - things like those Crush tunics that you were 
giving away to newbies when you were level 15 because they have crappy AC 
and are thus junk, or so you thought back then. Better to have less AC/mana 
or whatever but good svf, than to have loads of AC armouring your charred 
and smoking corpse.

Yes, you will have to buy some of the resist gear, but some is easily 
attainable at level 45, and there are things like the ulthork tusk quest 
for example, where you could hopefully get some diamonds and blue diamonds, 
if you can't afford resist jewellery and aren't of a level to go hunting 
anywhere with good gem drops.
