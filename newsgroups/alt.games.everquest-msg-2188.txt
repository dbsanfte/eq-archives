No, fair point.

Clearly to you he is not a troll but he gets called a troll enough times in
this thread.

And he's not allowed to say anything stupid or do anything stupid because if
he does he'll get flamed. I disagreed with his comments but I saw no point
in insuling him. It appears to me that to flame someone in this newsgroup is
the norm and the expected thing, anyone suggesting otherwise is the real
trouble maker.

I, further down this thread, get accused of being on my high horse, I can't
argue with that comment but how high is the horse you all sit on that it is
you must insult anyone that doesn't reach you intellectual standards?

Oh well I have dragged this thread out long enough if you have a comment
that wants a reply email it, this is my last post in this thread.
It looks as if I'll have to accept the flame replies, I don't believe in
filters, besides if I were to filter everyone that flamed in this thread
(that'd include Scott, himself) there'd be very little here to read :ï¿½)
