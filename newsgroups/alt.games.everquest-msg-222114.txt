I'm usually doing slow and haste in my groups as well.  You'll find no
argument from me about mages though, I try to get a mage in any group I put
together these days, they can't be beat for DPS + utility.

Of course I have lost missions, but I didn't chalk it up to pacify pulling
as the reason.  Maybe even the opposite.  In at least one case I can think
of the group wiped due to a few resisted mez attempts on a big pull.  It
could be that if we had pacified the room instead of just pulling it, we
could have saved enough time due to getting back to the spot and rebuffing
that we might have still pulled off the win.

I was thinking of the fact that it takes a few ticks to slow 3 or 4 mobs,
especially with the resists on LDoN mobs.  The off-tank may not need a CH
afterward, but chances are they will need something.  Keep in mind that my
groups usually only have one healer and I've never had one yet with SCM3,
SCRM, and quiessence :-)

Good points here, but  I don't see damage shields losing any usefulness as
long as a mob is in camp at all times.  DOTs, in my experience, don't see
much use in LDoN anyway.  I have no experience with costly aa abilities so
can't comment on those.

They go down *very* quickly.  Especially when, on a pull of 3 for example, a
resisted mez on one of the adds tends to bring both the adds after me with a
vengeance.  Can't argue with that point.

Level and play-style probably has a lot to do with this sentiment.  You're
65 and mostly group with friends, correct?  Well, I'm only in the 50s and
mostly just get pickup groups, since my guildmates are almost all higher
level than me and I play at odd times.  I must say though, my most fun
dungeon experiences so far have been when I was pulling.  I really enjoy
"scouting" out the next room or hallway, pacifying here and there, and
pulling.  So the chances may be slim, but it isn't unheard of to find a
decent player in a pickup group :-)
