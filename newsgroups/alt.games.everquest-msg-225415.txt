In PoI, I got nearly two gold in the same time it took me to get nearly 
3 blue in a single LDoN, at 55th level.  Rest of the group in PoI was 
53-59, and similar level in LDoN.

LDoN adventures at 55th tend to give me about 10% of a level, per dungeon.

LDoN adventures are about 300 times more exciting than sitting in PoI 
hitting assist (although LDoN adventures with groups who are good are 
still quite tedious being a mage), but for me, at my level, with the 
group I had, worked out far better in terms of XP.
