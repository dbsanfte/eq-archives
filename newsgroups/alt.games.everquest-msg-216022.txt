A word from a druid:

I am a 65 druid and since the day LDoN launched, my one and only role
in groups (I've done about 20 adventures with a pretty good win ratio)
has been main healer.

It's quite possible to do this effectively.  I have some trouble with
Warriors as they're not able to hold aggro as well as an SK or Paladin
and I end up having to heal other group members more than I should,
but overall, I can heal effectively and I think I have actually had to
meditate once in all the times i've done this.  My standing mana regen
with pot9, FT V, Mask of the Forest, VoQ, beast crack and bard song is
sufficient to keep everyone in the group healed and happy and never go
below 30 mana. I can also keep a DS on the whole group, regen, etc. If
we have a good slower and things are going well, i'll even throw in
the odd 1.5 K nuke (3k if the crit gods are smiling on me).

The CH we get is good enough for even folks with Time Gear (unless you
let them go to the "purple club", which no good healer should) and my
quick heal is enough for fully heal most casters when things go wrong
(resisted mez, etc.)

SoE have given druids the tools to do this.. but not necessarily the
skills. We are a solo class and most druids don't know how to manage a
group situation other than being the nuker/puller.
