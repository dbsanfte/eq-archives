 Your best bet is to make one yourself. I built mine last year and =
upgraded it in March. From kommax.com I got:

ASUS P4S8X MB w/8 agp - $116.00
Intel P4 2.53ghz --  $225.00
512mb DDR2700 -- $55.00

I also got an ATI 9700 pro w/8 agp for about $200.00 from Circuit City.

The sound card and HD's I already had along with one gig of DDR2700 and =
nice Sony monitor. But even adding in the box, SC and HD, you should be =
able to build a monster machine that is totally upgradeable for under a =
grand. But that's not including the monitor. And I wouldn't skimp there, =
spend the money and get a nice big flat screen and you'll thank yourself =
later.
