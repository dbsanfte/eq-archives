I believe I can speak to this just a bit. Kyrdra, my little wood Elf
Warrior, is now 2 Gold from 62. Ive been the MT for many LDoN groups, and
groups in PoV either at the Castle, or at the Caves. Frankly, it sucks.  Ive
had to spend 10's of thousands of plat on gear, and sacrificed AC for Dex,
yes you heard right Dex, and dropped approx 17k in weapons getting a Copper
Hammer of Striking, and a Sword of the Blood Sworn. Ive only been able to do
that because I farmed the heck outta what ever I could find that would sell
in the bazaar with my Druid. I doubt that the average casual player with a
warrior in the 60's has access to that. If, and ONLY if, I am able to proc
at a reasonable rate, I can hold aggro well. Fortunately, with high end
Shaman or beastlord buffs, my dex is maxxed, so this happens fairly
regularly.  I run into a string of bad luck proccing though and its sersious
hell trying to get the aggro back on me, even with a maxxed out taunt skill.
I have to tell slowers to hold the slows till I get the mob to 90%, or Ive
procced twice,  and tell nukers that they REALLY have to watch thier aggro.
It sucks, they hate it and I hate telling them that they need to do that.
The only saving grace for me is that Tanks are in moderately short supply at
the upper levels on Vallon Zek, but I still frequently run into the groups
that rather would wait for a knight class than take a warrior.

Bergh mentions the /shield disc that Warriors get starting at, I believe
level 30. At that level and even up to the 40's Shield is a decent way to
help out a caster who's gotten aggro. But once you get to PoP level mobs,
its completely useless. The mobs hit so bloody hard that even a shielded
dress wearing caster is going to drop in just a few rounds of combat. Its
not even REMOTELY comparable to a Palafin casting one of thier quick stuns.
Paladin gets the aggro back, and has the added bonus of stopping the mob
dead in thier tracks for a brief time, allowing the caster to get out of
melee range if possible.

And dont get me started on the refresh time on /shield - so long as to be
nothing more than a novelty item.

I cant agree with the Knights that are saying "Dont you dare give Warriors
taunt ability as good as weve got or were going to never get a group
again!!" Knights STILL will bring a lot more to the table than a Warrior
ever can. Paladins will still be stunning, reducing damage taken, and
healing required. They have awesome group heals, and heals over time. Not to
mention that a SU3 paladin is an absolute undead killing machine. SK's bring
Snares, Feign pulling, Taps to reduce healing required, and other usefull
abilities. Knights enjoy all those advantages over Warriors, and under the
current conditions are the absolute KINGS of hate generation! Give the
warriors the throne of  hate generation, and you'll STILL see Knight classes
as the main tanks for many, many groups.
