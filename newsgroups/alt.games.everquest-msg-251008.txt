I don't see anything wrong with that if they cut the admission price
in half, or the price of the refreshments. They don't do that though.
Instead, the price of everything goes up AND they stick in these ads.
Luckily, at the theater chains I go to such as the AMC chain, I only
at most see one commercial. It is still irritating, though.

They are likely to be actual in game stuff. There were a ton of clips
posted in a link over at the safehouse, I downloaded them all, which
are quite a bunch of actual in-game-playing films.

This is not that page, since they have new forums now and I can't find
it, but its a page of one of their previews at E3:

as you can even see from the shots on that page, it does look like
what you only saw in cutscenes in the fairly recent past.
