I honestly haven't tried in a long time.  I *generally* only run one
instance of EQ on my machine, with my cleric literally 2-boxed on a second
box.  Even then I use EQW on my main machine instead of the default EQ
windowed interface, because on the times that I have tried the default
windowed EQ, I've had numerous problems.

Problems I've had:

Second screen is black until I do something to correct it.  This is the
slowdown.  Yeah, it alt-tabs to the next window just as fast, but without
the extra step of fixing the black screen that's a fairly pointless
comparison.

The whole releasing and capturing the mouse is a bit bizarre.  With EQW I
just hit my "windows" key and go from there.

Random crashing, *especially* with trying to run two instances on the same
machine.  One "tech support" guy in chat said that it was probably just that
my machine wasn't up to the task.  I asked him what he recommended I upgrade
first, my 2.4 ghz CPU, 1 gig of memory, or 128 meg video card.  :P

Considering that I can count the number of times EQW has crashed for me
since I started using it on one hand, and I exceeded that in one night with
default windowed mode, I could base my entire decision on that.

The memory issues are also important, especially for people with lower end
machines.  I have my free memory displayed in the taskbar, and with two EQW
sessions going I have 300-ish free of 1 gig (after bootup, 796 free).
With two default EQ windowed mode it dips well below 200.
