Saturday night was a case study of this exact type of player. We were in DL
and picked up a 36 druid from a guild we have an alliance with.  She still
had a pre-patch KEI on, and was told that her job was to buff and heal the
MA.  I look over and see this dog clawing at the drolvarg I'd just brought
back, and I'm thinking, "I don't remember seeing the shammy throw a pet."
He hadn't ... it was the damn druid clawing away.

Six separate times she was told to sit down and heal the MA (the only reason
she was cut that much slack was because of the alliance), and six times the
reply was, "I have a ton of mana.  I will fight.".  So, to make a long story
short, at one point her nuking and beating got her the aggro of a Ravishing,
and the shammy was forced to make the choice of healing the MT (me) or her.
It was an easy choice.  Bye bye, KEI ... for good.

She was blissfully ignorant of the fact that she couldn't just pop to the
Nexus and get another until she refused the 95% rez from our cleric to head
up there.  Then reality set in.

"Why did they do that?  I've always had KEI.  I can't play without it (her
exact words).  If I can't get a KEI anymore, I may as well quit."

Sound familiar?

I don't know if she actually quit the game, but I know about 8 people she'll
never group with again ... alliance or no alliance.

Those who can't adapt tend to bitch at others who can.
