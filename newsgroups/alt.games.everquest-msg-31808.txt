Aye

I've noticed the same thing.

There are some GREAT halfling druids out there, but there are far more dr00d
types. I think it's because the dr00d chose his race based on l33t 5tatz and
5k1llz that halflings have (High base Wis, Hide, Night Vision etc.)

I started my Human Druid with no previous knowledge of what a Druid was
supposed to be. In fact folks in this NG tried to discourage me from
choosing a Human (not you Dan - you helped me out a lot!); I just liked the
race/class from a RP perspective (I had just finished a book on Merlin).

As I get past 50 I see fewer and fewer Halfling Druids (and I've been on
several Plane raids and hang out LFG in Sebilis and KC). I think many of
them stop when they get their last teleport spells so they can become
permanent taxis and generate revenue for their main chars.

I hate generalizations (generally), but being a Druid I pay a lot of
attention to other Druids and their behavior.
