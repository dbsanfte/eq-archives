He's not really a camped mob on Prexus.. I mean, 9 times in 10 if you zone
into DN your the only person there.

The second somebody sees him on track, however, you can be sure
friends/guild are on their way.  So yeah, he doesn't live long at all.. but
Id say hes an easier camp than Sev.

Well for the most part I just tease it for fun (same as druids)..  but
seriously - talking to warlords who believe the class to be broken, they
include their epics in this discussion.

The problem with any weapon epic is new weapons come out all the time.
Every new mob and expansion brings even newer and better weapons, all making
the epics look very outdated and useless.   Thats not just warrior epics,
but SK's and Palis too.. even rogues now.  Rangers and Bards are unique
because of their effect, there just isn't anything available to the masses
that does the same thing.

Warriors epic create agro.. and creating agro is central to everything a
warrior does.  As a result, +hate weapons became available in high-end
Velious (BoCs).  Then mid-tier in Luclin (hategiver, bloodfrenzy), and then
again in PoP from (what tier is that stunning blow weap?).  As time
progresses, each 1 becomes more available to the general masses, and each 1
in comparison beats the warrior epic hands down, making it less and less
desirable, and more likely to be upgraded sooner.

How do fleshgrinders compare to the warrior epic for holding agro?

So to summarise..  the warrior epic looks cool as hell.. but its an overly
difficult quest with an item easily upgradable should you ever join the
raiding scene.
