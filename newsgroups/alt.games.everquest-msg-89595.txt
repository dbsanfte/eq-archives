As others have said get your MR/PR/DR up. Get a golem metal wand or
pumice stone. Root the pet, disspell the necro asap, snare necro, dead
necro. For the most part ignore the pet as much as possible and keep
it rooted if you can. If you fight in an arena don't leave the arena
if you have a DOT on you as you will lose experience if you die
outside the arena from the DOT.
