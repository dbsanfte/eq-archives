I'm probably not answering your question, but I'll try anyway.

if you hit F10 during the game the screen "mode" will change to the
higher res you selected and radically change the way they look, feel. 
(I love it)

at that point my monitor tells me that I'm at "user 59hz"  hrumph.

some of the screens seem to be stuck at 640x480 leading me to infer that
there is some old code in the heart of the engine that was written back
in the old days.  Or maybe some old programmers?  (I hope that doesn't
sound disrespectful, I'm a rank-novice programmer) so maybe the legacy
code is also prone to 60hz...

I'm still locked in mortal combat with my SB audigy soundcard giving me
fits.  My wife gets cool sounds!  It's not fair! (waaaaaaa!)
