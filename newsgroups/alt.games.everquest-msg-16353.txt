From my own experiences (a level 14 human mage) I found that in the early levels
the Earth elemental was really good, especially as he rooted his targets and
didn't disappear into the night chasing a fast runner, though he did seem to get
hit more often and he's not really liked in groups. 

Water heals quicker, saving you the mana you'd use to heal your pet after
battle. Good for hunting the highly poisonous too! 

Air is good in groups and is less likely to disturb the locals whilst you're
medding.

I never used Fire. I'd heard they didn't last long and I wasn't made of money.
