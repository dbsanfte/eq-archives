Hell, even I can recall DT doing "regular" newsgroup participation
quite often, where have you been?

Here are examples from my *current* newsgroup index (no
need to wade through Google):

# First of all, don't look at how much damage you're hitting for alone.

# As for good HTH weapons that cost 25pp or less, you're not going to
# find any player-sold. Best chance is the off chance someone sold one
# to a merchant and the merchant has a low resell price.
