Install them all.  Expansions give more than just new areas, they add
features  And of course the main reason is, it doesn't hurt.  :)

Some advice, since you're already plunking down the cash, get Legacy of
Ykesha expansion as well.  The next part of this advice is to start a
froglok.

I was utterly amazed at how newbie-friendly starting as a froglok is.  Sony
has learned a lot.  Too bad this stuff wasn't in the game when I first
started.  :)

Extra advice, since you're already plunking down the cash, get Planes of
Power expansion too.  You won't see *any* of PoP for a long time except for
one zone, but that one zone can increase your enjoyment of the game
tremendously.  The portal system from PoP is incredibly convenient.

If you liked AC2, you'll probably enjoy EQ.  EQ is a little less pretty, a
little less cartoon-y, and a little bit more in-depth and varied in areas,
characters, classes, etc.
