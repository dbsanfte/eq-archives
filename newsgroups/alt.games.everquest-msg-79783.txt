I can think of two good reasons for not allowing levitate in Katta:

1.  (Primary reason) Given the way the zone is designed, with
levitate half of the players would end up flying over the
edge of the zone and off into oblivion (the upper city is
WAY higher than the lower city).  It's a beautiful zone,
it'd be a shame if they had to redesign it just to corral
high-flying levitators.

2.  (Secondary reason) Walking up or down the catwalk is
a vertigo-inducing challenge (albeit a minor one), and it's
something everyone should enjoy.  It'd be a bore to just
levitate and drop over the edge.
