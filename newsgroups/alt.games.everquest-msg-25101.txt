Heh, I don't think you can pickpocket while attacking. And even if you can,
you're putting up that much of a fuss over silver and copper?! Never known a
monk to be a penny-pincher...I know that I'm not--I even drop gold on the
ground, since I'm so close to the weight limit. By the way, in response to your
previous post about rogues and warriors not taunting off of you, that is BS.
I'm not twinked, I sat in EC and auctioned around...anyway, I have a trance
stick, KD, and FBSS...Rogues ALWAYS outdamage me with access to the mob's back.
And warriors of equal level tend to have trouble keeping the mob entirely to
themselves, but it isn't like the mob stays on me.
