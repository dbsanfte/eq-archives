I would have to agree with that also. I wouldn't ask to get her kicked
out but I would spread the word around the guild about her character. We
had a person in the (who also happened to be a girl) that was terrible
to group with. Even at her high level she seemed to have never learned
how a group works and it's tactics. I was partnering with her once and
she keep telling me not root the mob. A pally and a wiz and I'm not
supposed to root the mob, yea right. Upon having a mere half of bubble
of life left I was able to zone. I removed myself from the group of 2
and never grouped with her again. A few days later she was removed from
the guild for lack of social skills.
