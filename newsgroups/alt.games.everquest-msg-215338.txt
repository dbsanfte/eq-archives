How about this, then?  Add to groups support for a designated looter (DL),
set by the group leader.  Only the DL and the group leader can initiate
looting.  When one of them does so, everyone in the group in the zone gets a
loot window.  They can click on any items they want, which highlights them.
They can click again to unhighlight them.  After you get the things you want
highlighted, you click "loot".  If only one person asked for a given item,
they get it.  If more than one person asks for a given item, the server
picks randomly.  (I haven't decided whether "they get it" means it goes into
their inventory, or they simply get loot rights and have to go click the
corpse and click the item just like now).

That's just an sketch...there are details that need to be filled in.  Maybe
have a couple buttons on the loot window to speed things up, like one to
automatically highlight all the dropable items, and one to automatically
highlight all the class/race/diety items that you can use.
