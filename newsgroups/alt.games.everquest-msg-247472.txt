But it was pretty clear to me when I read the EULA that Sony hasn't
and will never ban *people*, they ban *accounts*.  We've had two
people in our guild get their accounts banned. One got their account
back and all of their items restored (that were either sold by the
person who hacked or got their account password by some other means
than the person giving it to them or when the account was banned the
characters were deleted, I'm not sure which it is). The other didn't
get their account back because they were sharing an account with a
friend willingly and that person did do the things that got them
banned.

So, while two people don't make a great pattern, seems to me that
Sony does listen at least some of the time when things aren't your
fault.

Naivete? And I'm not sure that I agree totally with this. I've seen
countless warnings about not giving your password out to anyone and
the EULA addresses this in two separate places in the first couple of
paragraphs at the very least.
