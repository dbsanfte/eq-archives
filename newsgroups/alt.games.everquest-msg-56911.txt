Hey, wanna come be my personal stalker? I haven't had one in awhile.

Whiners are scorned for their lack of common sense. We all understand
the frustration that patches often bring - but most of us are bright

And as for your 'wishlister' comments, look around and see all the
excellent features that have been added to the game as a result of
wish lists before you pretend you know how to mouth off.
