Ahh yes, I remember the thread of druids are not needed and others
posting they should just stop whining.  It Appears the whiners
(druids) have won another battle.  Almost everyone was against the
druids getting anything because they were all ready to powerful.  I
guess Verant thought they didn't have enough.

Like I said then,  they would eventually get there class balance
because they were truly not needed or wanted and the druids will
probably get a little more in the future.

It is not live but it is what the druids asked for and they got it.
