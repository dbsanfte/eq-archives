You obviously haven't kept abreast of current events...  :^)

No, to be fair, the restraint has lessened quite a bit.  This is
simply because world opinion has finally wised up to the fact that
every time Israel eases up and pulls back, more terrorist attacks
occur..

Israel doesn't shoot tank shells at children intentionally and
specifically.  Collateral does and has, happened, true.  Sad, tragic,
but a fact of war.

We're talking the specific, intentional and wanton targeting of
innocent non-combatants.  Innocent women and children who are NOT
involved.  THAT is what they PA terrorists do and THAT is why Israel
holds the moral high ground.
