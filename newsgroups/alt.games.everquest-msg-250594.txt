I'm playing around with my mage at the moment, trying to remember how he 
works and what I was looking into getting.

I have most of the spells up to 60, about half of the 60 ones and about 
a third of the 61 spells, and a couple 62 spells in the bank... probably 
a result of ethereal hand ins, I don't think I'd have paid cash for 62 
spells, since the bank is nearly empty.

As I recall, the last 5 levels went by reasonably fast, and I'm at the 
point now where spells and so forth are running "real money".

Something that happens a lot with a mage is that spells and gear become 
outdated as you level up; those pet focus items I worked so hard for 
stopped being useful by my mid 50s, I'm loaded up with summonable gear 
spell focus items that don't apply to my 61+ spells, so on and so forth.

I remember, vaguely, that I was working on LDoN points to buy a pet 
focus item (or was it augmentation?) for my 50s... is that item already 
obsolete due to me reaching 61?  Will it become so in the next 4 levels?

What items and spells are worth getting if I assume I'm going to be 
hitting 65 reasonably soon... but won't have a whole lot of access to 
rune spells and tier 4+ gear.
