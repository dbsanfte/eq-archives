Riposte as it is now breaks dual wield and weapon plus shield.
IMO, riposte frequency should be tied to time-elapsed rather
than your enemies attack frequency (they do this with weapon
and buff procs already).  This would eliminate a penalty
Warriors pay now for maximizing their hate generation.

I also think Warriors need better agro control, there's just no
way around the fact that many casters are more often limited by
agro management than by mana supply.  On top of that the hybrids
benefit from the same increased mana supply, which in the knights'
case has magnified their ability to hold agro and led many casters
to then strongly prefer these high agro knights as tanks.  LDoN
just made the situation worse with its emphasis on fast kills as
all three tank classes are notably inferior to others in DPS,
groups looking for high efficiency don't want multiple tanks.

I do find it, um, interesting, that SOE's official description of
the Warrior class calls out agro control via Taunt as a class
feature, while in-game the Warrior's Taunt is hugely inferior to
the knight's spell-based agro, which is supplemented by a Taunt
not all that much inferior to the Warrior's.  Maybe Warrior Taunt
should always add the Warrior's level in hate, then even an
unsuccessful Taunt would help keep the mob's attention.

I think making part of the solution via AA as Davian suggests might
be a good idea.  The Warrior's disadvantage increases with level as
it becomes riskier to have a mob go after a caster.

The tank classes' low DPS is always gonna produce some angst, I
suspect.  So long as they have significant content that stresses
fast kills, this alongside power-gamers tendency to go for best
xp/time when grinding, a lot of groups are going to be avoiding
having more than one tank.  There are going to be plate tanks
LFG, they are popular classes.
