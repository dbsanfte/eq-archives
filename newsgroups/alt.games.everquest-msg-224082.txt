   And this is not an isolated incident.  The market channel on FV is often
clogged with the bitching about how the latest operator did just this very
thing.  Same incident with different people, over and over again.  And FV has a
reputation (amongst FV'ers) of being the server with the highest maturity
level.  I don't know if I believe this or not (I think that the ocean is pretty
much the same level all over the globe).  Still, I have to think this is just as
or more common on regular servers.
