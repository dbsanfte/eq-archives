I am a halfling warrior level 45. I weild a wurmslayer and a Kunzar Ku`juch.
Before I could get some decent stat items, when the bar hit nil, agility was
dropped, thus hindering movement. Also, weapon attack spped seemed reduced.
Now with a stamina of 109, and boy does it go fast with a wurmslayer, I lose
no agility or other stats, I move normal, no encumberance, and attack speed
stays the same. So, I am a firm beleiver that stamina has no effect when
depleted with more than 100 stamina. Howerver, no matter what, if the bar is
nil, you still may not jump. Running speed is normal, but no jumps. Hope
this proves useful to someone.
