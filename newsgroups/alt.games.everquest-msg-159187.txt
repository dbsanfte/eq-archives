Doesn't matter. You were the new and unproven probationary member of
the guild, not them. So what if you later prove to be the best raiding
player in the guild. You still have to let them see that for
themselves. Their guild, their rules. Membership in any guild has its
privileges. Why would you want to be in a guild that doesn't perform
some sort of screening/evaluation before bestowing all guild benefits
upon a new member? Don't you normally have to work for an employer for
a while before you are eligible for benefits (health insurance, paid
vacation, etc.)? Maybe they just figure they ruled out someone who
doesn't have a very strong desire to be in their guild in the first
place.

What is *your* problem with two weeks? Two weeks is not an
unreasonable length of time to wait for the opportunity to get loot
that wouldn't otherwise be available to you.

Yeah, we don't think people should be able to change the rules that
govern everyone just so they suit themselves. We're funny that way.
