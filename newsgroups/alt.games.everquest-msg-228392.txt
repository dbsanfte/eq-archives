My fungus beast gland that is currently in my inventory has 10 charges, and
has for the past two years.  I was speaking in the hypothetical, for a
situation where I might see *one* point where a snare would make a huge
difference.  It's like my parents used to say, I'll work harder at being
lazy (i.e., not having to go get another fungus beast gland).  I see
situations fairly often where snare would speed up a pull, but have yet to
run into a pull that snare made possible that couldn't be accomplished
otherwise.

And guild bank money for monk snares?  Pfft.  I'm the one holding the guild
bank and I'd laugh at a monk that came to me with that request.  :)
