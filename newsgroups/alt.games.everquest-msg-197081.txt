Take a similar song, Bellow.  I think its undeniable that each pulse of
Bellow does damage, with no limit of one pulse per tick.  I've never
observed "phantom damage" using Bellow.  It was quite possible to do a 4
cycle of bellows in the time that you'd run a 3 cycle of DOTs, or in other
words, at early levels when you don't have but one DOT to sing, to do DOT
Bellow Bellow Bellow DOT, to greater effect than DOT Bellow Bellow DOT.

If as a general rule, pulse songs still had a limit of one pulse per tic,
then both the above twists would have the same effect.

Now it -is- still possible that for some reason Mana pulse is coded
differently from Damage pulse... but I'd have to wonder why bother, and why
noone seems to be giving an explaination for it.

It looks, from reading the quotes there, like they are saying we are
-supposed- to be rewarded for having the player dex to do more twisting.
