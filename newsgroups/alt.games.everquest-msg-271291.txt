My choice is I have enough of that 'team member' crap where I work.
I solo because I want to game that way. I first played Tunnels and
Trolls, 2nd edition back in 1979, and only started playing first
edition AD&D in 1980. So I found I prefer soloing. It certainly cuts
into having to listen to the whining from the other players about
how they don't like the armor I picked for my characters.

] on this than whether or not he does it with temp on, don't you think? 

I've gone into BB without temp or any buffs at all. I decided it
just waiting for bind woundsto get my 'toon back up to 70 percent
while sitting was wasting what few hours per month I have to game.
So I started using temp as often as I could. Afterall, its my 12
dollars and 95 cents I'm spending. Since I'll always be soloing,
itsup to me how I spend it. And it wont have any affect on the hobby
horse riders who falsely claim I'm buff whoring.

A much more likely scenario would be for me to cancel my account and
game somewhere else.

Actually, I will solo forever.

I had thought about learning how to group, learn more about how my
'toons work, etc.  But I have much better things to do with my time
than listen to twits riding their hobby horses.

I'm beginning to think this 'buff whoring' thing is just several
people's hobby horse. It gives them a good ride, but isn't worth
much otherwise, well, its gives them something to rant about.
Wouldn't be the first time someone on Usenet made a hobby out of
ranting about something of no importance, wont be the last.
