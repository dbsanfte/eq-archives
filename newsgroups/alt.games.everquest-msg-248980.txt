I'm playing CoH at the moment, and let me tell you something... It gets 
*awfully* repetitive. The first few levels are a blast, but I think that 
when I get tired of making alt after alt after alt, I'll probably cancel 
my subscription and come back to EQ.

Admittedly, if WoW lives up to the hype, I may be trying that one out too.
