hadn't heard that.  don't really affect me much, not like I'm giving them 
any money.  I use Firefox and I have a decent firewall so I'll never even 
see ads for IGE if they have any on that site.  Most of the time, on any 
site, ad banners just look like blank spaces.  I love my firefox, never a 
popup and adblock extension is great.  IGE is one of the things I have 
blocked at firewall level I believe.
