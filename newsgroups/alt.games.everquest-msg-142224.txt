The tailoring required for the leather padding is very low level.  Train 21
points in tailoring, and you are almost at the trivial for making leather
padding.  I think it's 26.  Buy Mandrake root, combine two in a tailoring
kit, this will take you to 56 in tailoring I believe, no farming required,
leather padding will then have a very high success rate.

I have a friend who has been asking the same thing, for the same reason I
suspect.  Basically, after the smithing nerf, smithing sucks.  Not as much
as Tailoring, but it still sucks.

AFAIK, the PoTC one is likely to be the best bet for you.  Everything needed
to make the components is purchasable, there are a fair number of
intermediate steps, and it does require brewing and pottery.  The trivials
for the intermediate parts are Brewing 136, and Pottery 103.  The higher
your skill level is above those trivials, the lower your failure rate on the
combines.  The resulting items are tradable, so, you could pay someone to
make them for you, or find a friend to do it, or maybe find them for sale in
the Bazaar.  Also, if you make some of each of them, you can then attempt to
combine all three items, and maybe end up with a sellable item, and a few
more skillups in smithing.  Trivial on the final combine is >250.
