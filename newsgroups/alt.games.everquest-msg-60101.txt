	What do you mean, 'so what?'  It would mean that anyone who didn't get
these weapons would be severely disadvantaged in PvP play because of something
that happens in PvE play.  That is an unacceptable dynamic in a PvP-oriented
game.

	If such weapons existed they would have to be tied to the expenditure of
realm points in some way.
