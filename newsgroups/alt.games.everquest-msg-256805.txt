As one who two days ago spent five hours helping a guildmate get
the last piece for his VT key at virtually no gain to myself, then 
seeing him deguild the next day to move on up the food chain, please 
forgive me if my faith in the good intentions of the EQ population 
at large is a bit drained.

A loot system such as was described is bound to attract self-serving 
jerks like that. That was my point.
