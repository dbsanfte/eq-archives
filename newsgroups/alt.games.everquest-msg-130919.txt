you must be running win2k (like me).

I found it a bit easier to use F10 to cycle through the screen modes. 
Three taps should put you back to where you started with no annoying
extra mouse pointer.

If your eyesight is poor, you **might** want to leave it in the second
mode.  you have a wider field of view to see the monsters, but the
buttons are a little smaller.  The chat window text is also smaller but
you can fix it to a limited extent with:

<enter>
/chatfontsize 6
<enter>

6 is as large as it will go.

all in all, setting up your keyboard shortcuts is highly recommended. 
the darn key is less hard to find in the heat of battle than the mouse
pointer and the button on the screen.  I have to force myself to stop
and spend 15 min getting them just right.
