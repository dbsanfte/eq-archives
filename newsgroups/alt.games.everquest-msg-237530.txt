For a gaming laptop the only real choice in video cards is the ATI
Radeon 9600 Pro 128mb DDR (M10-P).

A great value in gaming laptops are the ones built by Clevo and then
rebadged by resellers like Alienware and Sager. Last November I
purchased a Sager 5680 from http://pctorque.com/ The Laptop screams
and runs EQ flawlessly. I absolutely love it!  PCTorque offers a
30-day no questions asked return policy, so if you don't like a laptop
you purchase you are only out the cost of shipping.

You can get a 5680 today with the following for $1810.00
Wide Angle UXGA LCD (1600x1200 native)
P4 2.8mhz (800mhz FSB Hyperthreading) CPU (Desktop CPU in a Laptop)
512mb 400DDR dual channel memory
40gb HDD
8xDVD/24/10/24 CD-RW
WinXP Home
Built in Wireless

They have other models, including a wide-screen 17in that is amazing
for around the same price. 

This type of performance comes at a price though. Sager (or Alienware)
laptops are "Desktop Replacements". They use a lot of power and have
limited battery life (due to the poweful video cards and desktop
processors). My 5680 runs for about 2 hours on battery power.

If you want something with a long battery life, check out the Dell
Inspiron 8600 (or any other laptop with the Intel Centrino Processor).
An Inspiron 8600 nicely equiped with an ATI 9600 128mb will run
$2000-2500.00.

The Centrino processors are designed specifically for mobile
computing. Don't let the lower speed ratings worry you. A 1.7 Centrino
runs as fast as a 2.4ghz P-4.

You can read reviews and comments on Sagers and all other brands on
PCTorque's message boards. It is the best site I have found for
information on gaming laptops.
