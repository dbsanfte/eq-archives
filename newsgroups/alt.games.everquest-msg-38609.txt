> Well, you know what I hear? It's the EQ killer. No >really. :-P

I've looked into it just this morning. DaoC seems to be pretty much the same
as EQ. Chat box looks the same, buff box looks the same, health box is
present. Commands also work the / key.
The engine they use is a tried and tested one, I think this is good. The
world looks roughly the same as in EQ, though I have to admit it apears to
fit together better, no to blocky.
I don't like the forced PvP, in EQ I don't PvP and I like having a choice in
the matter. I do like, however the ability to gain a title, such as Knight.
In EQ getting a title isn't build in, it's just a neat trick VI though of to
give out rewards withough actually giving anything usefull.

I think SoL will be the clincher. If VI can bump up EQ enough to surpass
DaoC, the exsisting players base will most likely stay. If needs to be said
however that I do think that EQ as it is now, will most likely fall under
the might of the round table.
