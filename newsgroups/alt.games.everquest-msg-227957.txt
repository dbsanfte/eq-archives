I feel each class should have at least 1 thing no other class has.  Are there 
any classes right now that have one ability that no other class has?  You are 
correct when you say soon a rogue and an enchanter will be about the same.  
They need to make Enchanters the only class that can Mez.  Rangers the only 
class that can Track.  Warriors the only class that can Taunt.  Shamans the 
only class that can Slow.  Clerics the only class that can heal (ok, that may 
be going too far)
