/agree

Too easy.. . My guild is just starting to get to the level of bein able to
raid. 1st guild plane raid next week! We've been hunting some of the mobs in
UP who are tough (tho lookin at some of the  others there with their uba
gear trashing stuff is quite frightening   ) and shit I almost have to wait
till the mob is down 1 bub before I  can tash .. and then still get summoned
hehe (tho not really hit) and If I'm on slows aswell (very rare) ... eek.
(and thats using visages on myself and MA)

As someone else said, why can't permarooted mobs , hell even rooted ones,
summon when any type of agro increasing spell is cast on it ?  Has to be an
obvious answer rather than a verant oversight surely!!
