No, the trip from EFP to FV is closer to an hour if you miss
your connection with the shuttles.  The swim to the firepot
room is about 10-15 minutes, and the barge from oasis is
very frequent (for a boat).  Also, the poster did mention
getting levitate.  Of note, my mage with a 171 swimming ran
out of stam before the cluster of wrecks.  Also of note,
clicking on the firepots does not drop invis.  The fastest
way for a non TP-ing class to get from kunark to anywhere
else is via the firepots.  If a I'm anywhere near oasis and
want to get to Ak'anon or Halas or Erudin, that's the
fastest way.
