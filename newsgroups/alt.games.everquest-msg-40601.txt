30 is the start of the "hell" levels but there are great zones to solo and
work your way through it. Ill Omen and Warslik Woods are great places.
Frontier mountains and The Overthere can be good but TO is very dangerous
for lighties. Do not know a lot about Stoneburnt yet but if the XP bonus is
good and the loot is good a good group should do just fine in there also. I
have a level 25 Druid that I am going to take over to Stoneburnt and check
it out. My Iksar SK made 31 in 2 days soloing Giants in WW and I have gotten
7 Forest loops in there as well.
