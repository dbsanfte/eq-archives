I, my wife and son all are playing everquest while using zonealarm, set
to prevent "internet servers".  I've double checked to make sure that
zonealarm is configured the same on all three machines.

My wife gets no alerts, my son gets a couple of dozen warnings about
eqgame.exe wanting to accept a UDP connection (blocked) and I can
receive as many as 500 (the max it will log) during a couple of hours of
game play.

The sony website maintains that the connections, all above port 1024 are
required to update software.  (much to the consternation of many a
college student behind someone else's firewall)

the only weird thing about game play is sometimes my wife and I wont be
able to see each other, even we are standing right in front of each
other.  My son doesn't seem to have this problem.

I even donned my "peril sensitive sunglasses" once and killed zonealarm
and didn't notice any difference in gameplay.

so my question (to make a short story long) is:  Has anyone had bad /
good experiences with zonealarm and EQ?  

Thanks in advance for any wisdom you could share.
