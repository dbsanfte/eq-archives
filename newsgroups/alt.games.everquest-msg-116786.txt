SoW is simple for me:

If IN my group:

Saying something like "sow" or even "s" .. don't waste time with pleadse,
plz, or thx... If *I* am grouped with ya I appreciate knowing when it is
dropping.

If NOT in my group:

"Sow plz"  - No response
"Excuse me, may I have a sow?" - Unless i am doinging something, no reply
just a quick sow

I sow clerics and enchanters are a general rule unless the above applies.
