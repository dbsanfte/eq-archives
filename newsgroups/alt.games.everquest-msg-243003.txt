It doesn't really matter what you "think". Just to restore the context
you not surprisingly snipped...

In other words you hope someone sues because you couldn't play a game.
Congratulations on being the most pathetic person I've seen post here
in, oh... weeks at least.

Figures that someone completely new to the game would be able to
become so outraged at some downtime that they start the armcharm
lawyer BS.

Tough shit. It's a game, not your fucking life (or so I hope, I am
beginning to wonder). It will be back up when they get it back up and
you'll be able to use it again. Or are you suggesting it will never be
fixed?

>Whose playing?

Many people. The login server isn't keeping out everyone. But I guess
actually becoming informed on the subject is a little too much to ask
from someone who starts talk of suing after a single week of playing.

Look the login and DX problems suck. But posting the stupid things you
are here doesn't help anything and does nothing but annoy people here.
If you want to come across as a whining fuck then by all means
continue what you have been doing. But if you want to be regarded as a
thinking adult rather than a drooling protosimian keep your whining to
yourself or email it to Sony. WE already know about it. WE can't do
anything about it. WE don't care about your "issues". WE have enough
of our own.

Go ahead, quit. Please. The game is obviously not for you. There's
enough whiners in the game as it is.
