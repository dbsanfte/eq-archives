*jaw drops* Are you saying you find the current female models to be your
ideal?  That most male players feel this way?  

In that case, yes, you are right, she does understand men better.  You'll
have to forgive me because my husband finds the models ugly, as have some
of the guys I talked to.  Evidently I jumped to conclusions based on the
opinions of a few.  If I came off sounding like an expert on the male
gender, I apologize.
