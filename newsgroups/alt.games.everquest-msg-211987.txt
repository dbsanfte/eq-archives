SoW works if you have AA run, doesn't stack with it but coexists,
like a real haste coexists with a bard "spell type" song haste
without overwriting or stacking with it.  That is to say, if you
get a SoW while you have AA run, you run at SoW speed.  Not the
Run speed (which is slower than SoW, even Run 3 is slower than
even a level 9 shaman's SoW), but also not boosted by AA run plus
the SoW.

The reason I make a point of saying it doesn't overwrite SoW is
that the wonder of AA run is that its always there; if your
SoW/Selos/JBoots etc gets dispelled or just runs out you don't
bump down to normal player run speed, you bump down to your AA
run speed.  Same is true, by the way, about that bard song haste;
it coexists with say enchanter haste so that if you lose the
chanter version at least you have the bard one running, instead
of dropping all the way down to unhasted swinging.  "Coexists"
