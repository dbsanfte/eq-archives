I haven't bought them yet but I plan to pretty soon even though I'll
only be able to open 25% of the chests as a shaman. I've seen some
pretty nice items (linked) that only seem to come from the chests
(Regen 2 and  Vengeance 2 augments). 180 points isn't that much for a
shot at some decent (if extremely rare) loot.
