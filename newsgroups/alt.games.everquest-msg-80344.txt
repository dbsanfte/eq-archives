  No, he was only in the "Fellowship of the Rings".  I can personally
see why they left him out.  Though him and Goldleaf (I think that was
her name) are enchanting characters, he isn't really important to the
story except in that he rescues the hobbits early on in their journey
and otherwise is just a strange, merry little man.

  I think they'll put the Ents in, though.  Instead of simply rescuing
the hobbits, they play a vital role in the story as well (even if it
isn't a very long lasting role)... plus, they are just cool.  Big,
walking, talking trees.  Seeing a "forest" of Ents come alive and
march is a much cooler visual than Tom Bombadil singing in his cabin.
