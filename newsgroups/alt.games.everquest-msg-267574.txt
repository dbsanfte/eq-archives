Couple of additional questions:

Are you safe from the Spider's AoE if you're outside MBs room?  If so, does having the
door open or closed make a difference?

What are the spiders doing when you first enter the MB hallway?  Are they lounging around,
or are they forever walking into his room and blowing up, even before the event begins?
If they're blowing up, is it with their full-force AoE?

What actually starts the event?  Is it simply when MB notices that the spiders are no
longer making it to his room, or is there a trigger?

Does anyone know the Gnome's name, the one who spawns when MB is slain?  How long does he
hang around?

Thanks,

Tim ==
