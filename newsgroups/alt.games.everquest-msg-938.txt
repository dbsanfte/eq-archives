Most of the level 20 to 28 population is in lake of ill Omen, because
you level far faster there than anywhere else.

All the dungeons that used to contain people of level 20 - 28 are
deserted.

To attract people back to the Antonican dungeons Verant increased the
exp by a tiny little piddling amount, but I doubt it will make any
difference.  I checked out a few dungeons, nothing but monsters, no
adventurers.  Dungeons are certain death for soloists.  Unrest had a
few people in it, all people far too low for lake of ill omen, or far
too high for it, with a conspicuous gap around the lake of ill omen
levels.

At twenty nine, there is still plenty of blues in Lake of ill omen, but
I have noticed that there are few player characters above 28 hanging
out there.    The innermost levels of the Sarnak fortress are largely
uncamped.

Where to next?  And why, with the huge and fast experience one can get
in the depths of the Sarnak fortress, are not people harassing those
sarnaks?  Is there some even better place somewhere else?
