   Thanks for trying to protect me, but I'm a big girl and I will talk to
whomever I please.  I do understand that he is known to be more than a bit
irrational on this subject, and I have no great expectations of getting a
civil reply.  For what it's worth, I have a feeling that he will continue
to be irrational whether I talk to him or not.
