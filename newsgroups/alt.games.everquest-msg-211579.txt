For the last 3 weeks I have had two people who I believe to be one and
the same continuously stalk me in EQ.  I overheard Anomsuth / Tobais
talking to 2 other characters who apparrantly were younger kids, from
their responses, about 3 weeks ago while selling in Shadow Haven.  I
won't go into details of what I heard but I could tell this guy was
one sick bastard and probably into kiddie porn.  I confronted him and
told the characters he was talking with to put him on ignore and get
away from him.  From that point on he has been in every zone and at
every camp I'm in on almost a daily basis harrassing me.  I have put
him on ignore and reported him to no avail.  Yet, he still shows up
and won't leave me alone.  I'm tired of sick people like this ruining
a good game.  First you have casinos and now you have old men trying
to get their kicks from stalking kids in the game.  

If you see Anomsuth or Tobais on the Solusek Ro server, make sure you
let him know he has been reported and what a sick person he is.   On
second thought...it's probably best to stay away from him or he may
stalk you in the game too.  

Let this serve as a courtesy warning to all.
