My Paladin keeps Root mem'd almost all the time, so that wouldn't be
an issue.  And if your melees aren't up to handling as common an agro
issue as Root, at least once it's been explained if they are honestly
ignorant, it seems to me that your group is just a disaster waiting to
happen (I presume these are the same melees that routinely broke mez
earlier in their careers).  The biggest problem with relying on Root,
IMO, is that the mobs you most need it to stick on are sometimes those
most likely to break it quickly.  Even so, Root casts fast and can be
a life-saver, I never go without it when there's an Enchanter in the
group.

I've seen Enchanters use Memblur to good efect in situations where
multiple pulls were the norm and the group was relying on CC to
avoid downtime.  When it's normal to have 2 to 5 mobs mez'd on every
pull it's really just basic self-preservation for the Enchanter to
clear those hate lists asap.

Stuns do not overwrite mez.  I am told that they still accrue hate,
but I can't prove that and I'm not 100% certain of it.  I do know
that breaking mez with a dd+stun like Force, normally a very good
hate builder, is a good way to find out if your Enchanter can survive
4 seconds or so with that mob beating on him.  If a quick break of
mez is important for some reason, as it sometimes is, what has worked
best for me is (1) get behind mob*, (2) Taunt, Bash, auto-attack, cast
fastest Stun, and hit "assist me" hotkey, in that order and in rapid
succession.  If the mob still goes after the Enchanter, I will Root
and (hopefully) the Enchanter and/or Cleric will Stun.

* Bash is much more likely to stun from behind
