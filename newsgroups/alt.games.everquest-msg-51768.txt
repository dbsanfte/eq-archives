Your opinion is your opinion. Your opinion does not make DAOC a better game.

My opinion is that DAOC is different...a refreshing difference.  However,
where EQ is definitely polished, DAOC is a pain in the ass when it comes to
frame rates and lack of basic implementations that EQ has had for a very
very long time (in some cases, 2.5 years now).

I'm burned out of EQ.  I'm playing DAOC almost exclusively because it's a
DIFFERENT game.  Not better.  More fun *for me* because it's different.
Creating characters is different.  The skill system is different.

Different.  Not better.  DAOC pisses me off every day and EQ doesn't.  EQ is
much better written.  *EVERQUEST* is out of beta...DAOC is not.
