Yup, kill your enchanter NOW and create one splitting your stats between INT
and CHA.

My enchanter is level 55.  With my gear on, but no buffs, my standard stats
are 185 INT, 140 CHA.  I haven't noticed much difference between 140 and 200
CHA so I'm going to have to say that I'd max INT and dump the rest into CHA.
Once you get to 16 or so you'll want to start making a "CHA kit," for those
times where you're willing to give up INT for CHA.  Without buffs I can get
my INT/CHA anywhere from about 201/120 to 165/180 depending on what I need
at the time.
