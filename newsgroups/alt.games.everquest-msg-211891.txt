Do you think a 55 druid could root/dot the wolves and/or the guards?

I love hunting in Katta.  My ranger went from 39 - 45 in the graveyard, and
the benefits are just as Tim described ... easy to go afk, easy to sell,
easy to bank, etc.  Of course, I promptly ruined the ranger's faction by
doing the Jeweled Quiver of the Hand quest, but hey ... that halfling simply
had to die. ;-)
