Try the othmirs one more time after you get fist.  It is so much fun.

Almost all the suggestions given so far are root/rot.  At 58 plus you
are talking long long long rots.  Exp is far better if you can find
decent mobs to quad.

Other than CS, the other 2 very good quad spots I've found are the
Grey and Maidens.  Both have adds: traps in Grey and wanderers in ME. 
But quadding is relatively safe in the corners of grey (also back side
of temple) and on toiler hill in ME.

BTW I would love to try HS.  I hear the experience is great.  But the
thought of getting a cleric to rez me there is daunting.  And,
unfortunately, I now hear the mobs start to turn lite at 58.
