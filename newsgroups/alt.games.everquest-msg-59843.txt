Yes I was fighting in the Tim Deep at the Ogre camp, pulling watchmen,
raiders for blues and light blue Wise Ones. My XP bar slowly crept up
towards 27 for my ranger. I was pulling about a half blue bub per critter,
maybe 3/4 of a blue bub for the highest level ones.

Got to the one more kill point of just under half a blue bub, picked
myself a nice formidable blue, a Watchman. Ding....looked at my xp....2
full blue bubs thru the next one......I just do not understand the XP
system on this game, but I aint complaining :)
