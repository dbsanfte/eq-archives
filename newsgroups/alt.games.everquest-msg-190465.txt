    Always a plus.

    Most of these things are already logged I believe.

    At no point did I suggest a human review the masses of logs, I was
talking about an automated process. Log analysis is not rocket science, and
neither are scripts that do it. I don't particularly mind if you think it's
too complicated, because I wasn't suggesting you write it.

    Relinquish the efforts of your characters to what? I would assume log
analysis scripts are already in place to aid in hunting down things like
transfer fuckups - so whether you're willing or not 90% of it's already
happening.

    The bazaar appears slow for the sole reason that there are so many
characters in it at any given time that your video card has trouble
animating it all. It is most certainly NOT a cpu bottleneck on sony's
servers. Aside from that, as stated above most, if not all of these things
ARE already logged.

    There is no rule against powerlevelling and most people who are being
powerlevelled are actually alts of experienced players. Those who aren't at
least have some tuition from their PLer. Besides, I'm not going to argue how
much of a problem this is. It *is* a problem, and I wanted to talk about a
possible solution, not which problem gets the biggest tomato.

    Life not being fair is not a justification for apathy about people
parking in handicapped spots. In fact you might notice that a certain
percentage of the time, when somebody does that, they are fined. Moving back
to EQ and buying plat, you might notice that it's almost unheard of for the
hammer to come down on people who buy and sell plat. This is largely because
the human effort involved in policing it borders on the ridiculous - hence
my suggestion for some sort of automated system.
