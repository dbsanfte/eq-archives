Although I have reservations, it's too far off to say no but also to say
yes. I have been playing EQ for 2yrs, I doubt I'll be playing by the end of
the year.
I'll prolly give it a go, as I did with DAoC, it might be great, it might
crap...it is far to soon to say by one article and 4 screen shots.
Mythic made DAoC's UI look and feel as much like EQ as they could, this was
to help people move across...I wonder if Verant have made or are making EQ2
as much like other games as they can to capture players.

What with AC2 out at Christmas, DAoC already here and growing, I think the
golden age of MMORPG's is coming to an end, saturation of a market is not
always a  great thing and the moment is sort of lost...in the same way UT
and Q3 never captured the community like Quake2 did, even tho, imo they were
better games.

Guess we'll wait and see, does put a sense of foreboding over playing a game
that now has a finite end in sight where once there was nothing but the
future, for as long as you enjoyed it.
