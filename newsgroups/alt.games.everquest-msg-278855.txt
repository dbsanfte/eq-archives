Death, sorrow, sickness and pain is what makes us strive, improve, expand
ourselves and grow.  Personally, your heaven sounds a dull place, suitable only
for sheep.  I would much rather have an afterlife without greed, pride,
jealousy and fear of oppression.  Maybe you should tell us how to achieve that
in this life instead of telling us how great the next one's going to be.
