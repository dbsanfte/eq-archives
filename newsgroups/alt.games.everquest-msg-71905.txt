There is no best...

Most effecient at most levels is the necromancer.
However from 51 onwards my Wizard was outsoloing my necromancer by a
significant margin....able to quad kite 4 blues for only half his mana.
although my necro could be Full mana at the ned of a fight it took him alot
longer to kill things than my wizard... My wizard was killing 12 Wyverns at
lvl 51 to every 8 that my necromancer was doing...he was lvl 53 at the time.

Now druids also are quad kiters...however at 51 plus wizards become much
better at it than druids.... their AE snare and the effecency of their AE
spells is way better than a druids.

So i would say for indoor soloing best classes are (in no particuar order
although IMO necro is best)
Necromancer
Magician
Shaman (at higher levels)

For outdoor Soloing:
Wizard (best)
Druid (second)
followed closely by the other classes who are good indoor soloers.

Alakazar Kaboom
55 Wizard
Ayonae Ro

Jamman Darkdaddy
56 Necromancer
Ayonae Ro
