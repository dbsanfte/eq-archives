I forgot to mention, although its covered in other threads, the method for doing this.

On login, go in and turn off all Luclin models except for horses/elementals.

This will (contrary to the message you get when you try model on and horses off) give you the
horse buff icon, and the sitting without sitting meditation thing, without the horrible other
effects of a horse.

Logic suggests that you would want your model on and horses model off, but that doesn't work.

You may be able to go in and turn most models other than your own race & gender... but first turn
them ALL off so you can see my suggestion working, then turn things on and see if you've broken it
again.
