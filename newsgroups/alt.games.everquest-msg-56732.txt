It seems to me that I remember seeing in the patch message something
about playing low level NPCs on PVP servers. I have several characters
on one or two PVP servers, so I'm no stranger to them. However, I
don't see the Monster button that's supposed to let you play an NPC.
Am I supposed to do something specific to do that? Or did they nerf it
already?
