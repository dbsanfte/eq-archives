I have a lvl 16 necro but someone told me that It would be hard getting
into groups when I reach a higher lvl. So my question is what is the most
"group friendly" caster. I was thinking about starting a wizzie because I
like
the dd spells, but then I read a thread saying that a wizzie isnt that
wanted
in groups.

Whats your oppinion? What would u recommend?
