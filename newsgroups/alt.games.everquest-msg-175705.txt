Yep.  And then, after ruining a bunch of peoples days and destroying
your toon's rep (one char per server, no?), you sell the account and
let the sucker, er, buyer, deal with the fallout.  And of course, if
SWQ has the same account policies as EQ, you wait a week or two and
repossess the account, causing even more grief.  After leaving the
character idle for a while you slip back into the game and do it all
over again.

Does that answer your question?
