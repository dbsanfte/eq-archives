As per OED,

Celibacy - vow of no marriage.
Chastity - vow of no sex.

OED = Oxford English Dictionary.  I picked up a copy for only $300 a
little while back.

And yes, I recognize that the term is changing.  But that's only
because people insist on using words based on what they *think* they
mean, rather than looking up the actual meaning.

By the way, bizbee, have you ever made a subtlety?  I've tried, but
it's well beyond my cooking skills.
