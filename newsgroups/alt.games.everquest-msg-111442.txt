Well, as pointed below, it probably isn't true. With the exception of some
mules (who only carry food) do you really think a character is going to have
6 full bags and 2 items in his inventory and that's it? More realistic
situation would be 3 or 4 bags of items and some individual items that are
taken from other bags, it's these that can cause the problem. When a trade
is cancelled the items return to the first available inventory slot then
container slot, then hand then the floor, they never go back to an equipment
slot and do not return to the slot they were taken from, unless of course
that is the first available slot. As for a particular item...well that would
mean you have informed them of the items you are selling so there is no need
to dump a bundle of bags on them (?)
How many times have you seen people shout out that someone has just picked
up their bag and to give it back?
Now they maybe idiots but I know damn well why the bag dropped, by not
messing around with them in the first place you don't have to worry that one
day you maybe careless.

If there is relevant info then I add it to auction eg Groaning Mace not
usable by Paladins, Intel's Hammer only usable by priest classes (what a
waste of a ratio, 13/25) and if someone is interested in an item I have
auctioned I have no problem spending a few moments answering questions. Less
trouble? I have never heard of anyone losing an item because they went LD
while typing a description of it.
