One of the things we've done is 'Heritage Day', where everybody forms
up groups based on what heritage you are working on, and pounding
through them.  This works really well for the easier heritages (SBD,
Crook, JBoots, etc) that can be completed without camping some rare
spawns.  Some groups have even managed to snag the Guise during those
days.  One guild had two groups go into DFC and complete 11 SBS and
SSOY quests at the same time (22 heritages total).

Other things are writs, where we have groups compete against each other
to see who gets the most writs completed before the end of a timer (two
hours or something semi-reasonable).

Some people like to have contests on who can best decorate a house in a
certain time limit within a budget.  Judging those can be difficult
though :P

If our resources for crafters ever get low, I could see a race to see
who harvests the most stuff for the crafters in the guild happening.
It'd be kind of fun to see how many resources a few groups
power-clearing a couple zones for a while could bring in.

There was a race for lowbies on Permafrost last weekend.  There was a
series of waypoints each contestant had to hit on the run from Qeynos
to Freeport.  If the person dinged a certain level (10 or 11 maybe?),
they were disqualified.  So not only was it dangerous, you had to watch
your XP and disable it if getting to close to the limit.

I really enjoy the Heritage Days though...
