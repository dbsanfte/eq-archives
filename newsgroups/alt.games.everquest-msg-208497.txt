There is just something about owning that collection of books though...

I used to be a voracious reader, and I did use the library, as well as 
second hand book stores, and pleny of new books as well.  Since EQ, I 
have to admit that I read a lot less than I used to.  About the only time 
I read now is on my lunch break at work.
