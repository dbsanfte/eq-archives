    Scammers don't have friends on other servers to help them. Keeping your
gear is crucial, as not only does that gear let you get close to the people
you want to scam but it also keeps the E-Bay value on the account high if
you have to "flip" it when things get too hot.

> As for keeping the same server...*shrug* What's the difference?

    You know who the big-time players are. You know who fell for you before,
and who didn't. Going to a new server you have to re-learn all these things.

    Another stupid process. I can't believe they don't even keep track of
which server people on split servers came from....
