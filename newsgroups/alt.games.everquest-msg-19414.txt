I'm not sure that situation would actually happen all that often.

Assume no mules or twinks.  What is the likelyhood that the person who is 
selling an item is lower than the person who is buying it?  At least 
sufficiently enough that they can't make it to a guard area in time.

It seems likely to me that certain areas of zones will acquire new 
significance.  For example, the midway distance between Nektulos zone line 
and West Freeport zoneline, on the north edge of the East Auctionlands zone.

(Okay, you can have mules or twinks on SV if you have more than 1 account, 
but that is going to be the unusual exception rather than the vast majority 
as on other servers.)
