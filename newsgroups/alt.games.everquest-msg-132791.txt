}Drivers Education

}Sex Education

Probably 3 years old, I'd say.

}Drug Abuse Counseling

2-3 does seem early, and I don't really know, but I'm sure this book would 
have an answer.

}Infantry Tactics

Personally, I'd be very careful about teaching that one, without the 
message that if you end upin a situation where you need infantry tactics, 
you've probably already done something questionable.

But this guy works with children as young as 3.

}Cancer
}Death

All right, wait until 3.

}Preparing Taxes

May as well prepare them for the inevitable.  I mean, hey, if you start on 
em young, you may convince them that the 1040 is a positive joy, and then 
they'll grow up to do your taxes for you. :)  Recommended supplies:  Go to 
the local library and get a bunch of whatever forms are left on April 
16th, then introduce the child to the concept of 'scissors'.  The little 
round-pointed kind of course. :)
