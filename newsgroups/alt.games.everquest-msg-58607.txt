I picked up a really nice Embued Mithril Fier'Dal Morning Star for my
Tunare lovin' druid. Lovely stats. Should run you between 150 and 200p. No
proc like the Screamer but then again, at 19 you just got a STR buff
that's better than the one the mace procs.

9/35 AGI+4 WIS+2 CHA+2.

It's nowhere near the best, but it's nice.
