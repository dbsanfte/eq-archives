Don't recall any "well" in northern (goblin) part of Solusek A. The
closest thing, off hand, that might be considered a "well" are a
couple of traps (pit falls) that lead to the Efreeti pits (the rooms
east of #3 on eqatlas map).

When you actually reach the objective, does EQ tell you that you have
accomplished the task's goal/subgoal or do you have to go back to the
task master to find out? Or maybe the task window??

Hope this helps.
