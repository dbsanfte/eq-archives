I guess I'll get slammed for this, but got to get it off my chest.

I've worked hard to develop a Lv 10 druid.  Had good equipment and money in
the bank for spells.

The recent crash stole all that.  Had just retrieved my corpse when lights
went out.  On reconnecting, I was naked as a baby with no corpse in
existance.

I started petitioning the GMs at 7:30 in the morning.  It is now 11:20 at
night.  No help.

I emptied my dearly built bank account to purchase new armor and weapon.
Joined a group and had a great time killing drakes.  But waited and waited
for a response to my petition. Nada.

So now I have some mediocre equipment and nothing in the bank.  It will take
me forever to get back to where I was.  And I'm not sure it's worth it.  I'm
probably better off starting a new character.

The really bugging thing is...  why didn't anyone ever respond?   I know GMs
are busy after a crash, but we're talking 16 hours.

I love EQ to the point of addiction.  But this is a really good cure.

Late at night.  And phooey ballooey.
