Look into my eyes... {Bards are perfectly balanced.}.....

While that may be true for Aikido, try telling that to a Hapkido or Wing
Chung (I know, Kung Fu, not Karate) artist.  Wing Chung's purpose isn't to
redirect force, but to end fights as quickly as possible, with as little
damage to yourself as possible.  That's what I envision a monk as being.
Indeed, this bears out in real life.  Wing Chung was developed by a woman
(which is why it empahsises blocking as "not being where the blow is" rather
then absorbing the blow), and taught to monks for their defence.

Unfortuneately, this leads to not being able to do anything well.  A paladin
needs to be strong on all counts to be viable with the current engine.
We're almost there, but there could be a bit of tuning.

Kick them into fletching, I need customers.
