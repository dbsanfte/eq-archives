Don't get rid of the idea of a sheild, although you may want to
upgrade your current sheild.  There will be instances where you will
want to use the sheild (i.e.  you're on the undead side of lower guk
and break the 'ole GB out).  I was just saying that you may want to
get a 2hs item, and alternate weapons occasionally, to keep both
weapon skills capped.  One choice for a sheild that you might
consider, is the Cracked Darkwood Sheild.  I forget the exact stats
right now, but it's around 15ac 10str.  If you have decent wisdom and
low strength (as a high elf pally might), then this would be something
to look into.  Another choice, if you have moderate strength and lower
wisdom, would be a charred guardian sheild.  I don't recall the ac on
this (12, maybe?), but it has a wisdom boost of 9.  Both of these
sheilds can be found for around 200-400.
