Peter Jackson didn't just make spatter movies, he made some of the
most vile, cringe inducing, yet still completely hilarious splatter
movies ever.  Equal part Fangoria and the Three Stooges.  I had a
friend of mine nearly become physically ill watching BAD TASTE (the
most aptly titled movie EVER).

If you have a very strong constitution and warped sense of humor, I
strongly recommend you go out and rent/buy both BAD TASTE and DEAD
ALIVE.  Fun, fun movies.
