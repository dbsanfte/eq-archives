Tested thousands of items, in particular, armor, jewelry, and weapons, 
until I could discern the pattern. It is not a direct function of stats, as 
it was before. 

Basically, they averaged all the bazaar transaction prices over all the 
servers for each item. 

How they did it is actually a bit more complicated than that, but the above 
is a very good approximation. 

What they actually did is this. 

Based on median bazaar transaction price for a particular item of armor, 
jewelry, or weapon, that item was assigned a tier or band. This means 
actual sales, with a buyer purchasing from a trader, not merely the price 
offered by a trader. 
There are a few hundred of these item tiers or bands. Each tier was 
assigned a favor value, again based on the median selling price for items 
within that tier. 

As a result, over all, it is no longer possible to exploit the difference 
between the bazaar sale price and its tribute value, and thus, one favor is 
worth roughly one platinum piece, over all. 

However, differences between servers mean that the items with a favorable 
favor to plat ratio differ from server to server. Servers with high prices, 
either due to inflation or a young server, may have little or no favorable 
items. Cultural differences between servers, which result in certain items 
being undervalued, make those items favorable for tribute. 

Here are some examples of favorable tribute items on Tarew Marr: 

Slippers of Dark Mana, 500 pp, 1930 favor. 
Robe of Tempest, 5000 pp, just over 20K favor. 
Orb of Infinite Void, 5000 pp, just over 23K favor. 
Ornate Rune Shield, 400 pp, 1360 favor. 
Rusting Hero Shield, 400 pp, 1020 favor. 
Tactician's Bulwark, 9000 pp, just under 28K favor. 

Note that even for favorable items, the best ratios are rough 3-5 favor per 
1 plat. 
Also note that on other servers, these items may cost much more, and so the 
ratios are not favorable on those servers. 

The tiered assignment of favor values yields some interesting results.

So, SOE's intent *appears* to be 1PP=1TP.  So, let's take a look at some
of the tribute master's buffs and how they stack up.

Swift Arms 1 = 21% haste.

It costs 30tp/hr to keep up. At a cost of 1pp/tp it will take
about 70 hours played to equal the cost of a FBSS, 100-125 hours to exceed
the cost of SCHW.

At effect level 3 it costs 120tp/hr, at that rate you exceed the cost of 
31% haste enchanted sash of wonder in ~170 hours.

For 222tp/hr you can have 41% haste.  it takes less than 100 hours to
exceed the cost of my 31% haste belt.  For that money you get a 7.6%
improvement in dps w/o spell haste, 5.5% improvement w/ Celerity and
a .5 percent improvement with SoV.

The problem is that, anyone with the cash to have multiple benefits running
constantly also has the cash to get an equivalent item and hit their break
even point in a relatively short time.

This means that, in order for the Tribute system to continue to pull cash
out of the system either the TP/PP ratio has to change or the cost of
tribute buffs must change.

Who is going to spend 126pp an hour to get +10 to a stat?  Heck, I won't
even cast Stamina (63 minute Sta buff) to max my stamina out because it's
on a different timer than IoS, Kragg and SV (72min).

Since the costs/benefit ratio of many of the benefits needs to be adjusted,
I'd leave the TP/PP ratio at one and adjust the cost of benefits.  However,
I doubt they will, and the tribute system will become a novelty of the rich
rather than an effective plat sink.
