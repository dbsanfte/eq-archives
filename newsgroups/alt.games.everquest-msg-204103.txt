All the minis are single group encounters even for a group of high 50's.
They are all - except the maestro - the same ol, same ol minis.

The Maestro and Inny have both been completely reworked, and are now MAJOR
raid level encounters. I've heard of the Maestro being done by 30-40 Lvl60+
well disciplined raiders on a well thought out raid plan. I've also heard of
LOTS of wipeouts on him. The new Inny is a ring event, and I've seen little
to none on other material about him.
