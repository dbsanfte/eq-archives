The goons are fun to play with.  They are strictly melee, and at least at 
level 65, not all that resistant.

The General is the one I worry about.  I am still working out my strategy 
for taking him down.  The tricky part is slowing him before my pup is 
dead.  The good news is he is rootable, but, he is pretty resistant.  The 
other good news is that at level 65, my sow is faster than him.
