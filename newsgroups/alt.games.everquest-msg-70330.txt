Jealously, primarily, followed closely by willful ignorance. Unless a
player is buying their twink gear off of EBay or being given it as a
gift, at some point, they earned it in-game through their own play.

The anti-twinking attitude comes primarily from those who can not
afford to twink and who choose to ignore the fact that several
characters are avatars of the same player. Asking whether a particular
toon earned an item is framing the question wrong.

I try not to let the anti-twinking people bother me. They'll either
get to a point in the game where they start twinking themselves or
eventually give up.
