I planned a language fair with my guild for post patch fun, since we
expected the servers to come down *a lot* after the patch, as they usually
do. Language fairs are safe, fun, and nobody gets in a messy spot if the
servers go down suddenly.

Unfortunately, guess what no longer works?

That's right, we had several groups of people try in different zones (Yes
everyone in the group was in the same zone- but we tried in different
places) at several times last night. No skill increases after 15 minutes
between Jakiss and myself for instance, and usually you can learn a whole
language in that time with our current INTs.

So forget speaking in tongues at the moment. I'm irritated enough that the
/lang command doesn't work any more.
