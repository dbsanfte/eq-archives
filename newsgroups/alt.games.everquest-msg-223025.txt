Where 
PL is Player level
M is the modifier (1)
R is the race penalty

XP to get through a level is
PL*PL*PL*1000*M*R

M is the tricky one.
It used to be that
M = 1 for levels 1-24
M = 1.1 for 25-29
M = 1.2 for 30-34
M = 1.3 for 35-39
M = 1.4 for 40-44
M = 1.5 for 45-50

This caused the famous "Hell Level" effect

To get from 24 to 25 the amount of xp needed (for humans) was
(24^3*1000*1.0*1.0) - (23^3*1000*1.0*1.0) or
13,824,000 - 12,167,000 = 1,657,000

But to get from 25 to 26 
(25^3*1000*1.1*1.0) - (24^3*1000*1.0*1.0) or
17,187,500 - 13,824,000 = 3,363,500

Then from 26 to 27
19,333,600 - 17,187,500 = 2,146,100

So, every time the modifier went up, there was a hell level
where you needed to make up the difference in the modifier times
your total xp to that point.

They smoothed this progression out,- the amount of xp to get from an
old hell level to the level just prior to the next one is the same as
it used to be, but it is distributed more evenly so there is no hell
level.  The last level needs more xp than it used to, the hell level
less.  It's probably done with another modifier based on level, but
I don't know the precise mods.
