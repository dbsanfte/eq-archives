Yeah, I have a bad habit of assassinating named/rare spawns in zones I
travel through, even when they're green, so I kinda accumulate some ok loot
that I can't sell, I gave a level 30ish druid that I was talking to a couple
days ago (bought a demi-sec champagne off him for my earring, he'd gotten 4
demi-secs for a port, lol) some cultural imbued boots that I'd had from my
newbie days, a neat 2hb (Groaning Mace) and a couple drop spells that
weren't worth my time to hang onto (Circle of Summer and Winter IIRC)

Dragon killing is fun, assuming that you're with people who know what
they're doing anyways.  My first (and only; made 53 within a couple days)
Vox raid, we killed her with 24 people (4 groups), it was smooth, once we
got it through a couple peoples heads to STOP BUFFING AND CLICK OFF YOUR
DAMNED KEI!

I killed Phinigel for the first time over the weekend, heh, that was neat,
though he seems a bit nasty at first with his dispel proc (I tanked him for
about 30 seconds before MA got him off me =P).  Got my Kedge Cave Crystals
while I was there too (and got complained at by the clerics RL husband from
10 zones away because I looted it after asking 5 times if I could,
apparently the cleric wanted it for their druid bot, wtf).  I've only got 4
epic fights to go, Faydedar, VSR, Ulump and.... the uber-brownie from hell.
