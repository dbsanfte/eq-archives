    There is no default ZEM, as I've already pointed out. So what were you
talking about, again? (This is your chance to try a new story!)

    Post links here, please!

    There is no default ZEM. So why would you talk about one?

    Not to you, anyways. ;-)

    The term comes strictly from the formula in which it is used. Whether
you're pretending to know what that means or not is entirely irrelevant to
what it means.

    "The moon has a modifier to gravity? I'm surprised that a stellar body
so close to Earth would have a different modifier than Earth!" /snicker

    Good lord, you still don't get it. I'm beyond stunned, and into amazed.
A ZEM doesn't just modify XP given in a zone, as that would imply that
without a ZEM (remember, there's no default) there would be some standard
amount of XP one gets. But without a ZEM, you get nothing. Nada. Zip.

    Got it yet?
