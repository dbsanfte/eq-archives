There are far too many factors that go into connection quality that have 
nothing at all to do with how you connect.  Having performed tests myself 
with and without AGI buffs, seeing exactly zero difference in average 
speed over a lengthy run, I am confident in saying that AGI has zero 
effect on run speed.  The only real way to test it is to use the same 
character with the same encumbrance doing the same run repeatedly.  Do 
that run several times with different levels of Agility, then compare the 
average results.
