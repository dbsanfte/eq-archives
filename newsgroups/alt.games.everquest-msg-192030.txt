1) Annoying having to click the mouse to get to agree to the Eula.
2) Text in tells, chat etc is disappearing or taking ages to come through.
3) Mobs patching fix has messed up a lot of zones. Anyone go into PoV after
server up and see all the worms running around the tops of the hills )
4) Emperor Ssraezsha (Sp?). The wraiths that spawn after his death are
poofing immediately of their own accord and so denying people their rifts
for Vex Thal key. I heard that other green mobs were poofing in similar
manner if killed by high lvl.
5) PoP mobs are not enraging. HoH and BoT and PoTactics.. none of the mobs
enraged.
6) Monks saying FD not working very well

That's only what I found.

Also it seems that the new Ranger aggro rules went live without message. Lot
of our rangers were gaining aggro rapidly and dying in Vex Thal.


Jontom tells the group, "Patch Incoming, expect pain"
