If you're talking about mob corpses for looting purposes, click
slightly above them. For some reason, the corpses are floating a
couple feet off the ground, but the game doesn't usually display them
there. (I have seen the corpses actually displayed as floating on
occasion) Just another new engine oddity... :/ One of those bizarre
ones that I can easily shrug off as something they couldn't have seen
coming. :p
