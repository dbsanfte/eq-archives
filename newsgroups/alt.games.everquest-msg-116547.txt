Once again tyger well put! I think that just about sums up the whole "sow
plz" debate.
On a side note I did a drive by sow the other day (i always do if traveling)
and the target of my FREE buff had a go at me complaining that he doesnt
need my charity??? Odd attitude for a warrior i thought :) but hey who cares
the other 99% of "oh thanks! nice one" makes it all worth it.
