I'm not sure why I would want a knock back spell/ability? It's nice that
the mob gets out of melee range and can't hit me, but then I can't hit
it either. Seems like a wash to me. What am I missing here? Does it do
more damage maybe? Stun?

OMFG! Ok this is next after the mana regen ones. Nice to be able to
say goodbye to those fizzles. Especially since they always come in a row!

Your spell fizzles!
Your spell fizzles!

Very nice.

> Improved Natural
abilities

Nice to be able to finally make up for those allocation mistakes made
during character creation.

Hey where is mastery for tailoring and smithing? They have it for fletching and
jewelry! =(

A lot of these are very nice but some of them are so subtle how will we know
if they are working correctly? Verant has a nasty habit of putting things in that
don't work or work backwards even. What if that fizzle rate was increased by
2% instead of decreased by 2%?

Some of them seem too powerful and seem destined for the nerf bat.
But I am definitely looking forward to them.
