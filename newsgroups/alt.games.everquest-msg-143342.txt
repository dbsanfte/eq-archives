    The paladin heal is a "heal me NOW" heal with a good chunk of aggro to
it. It works very well for healing quickly in uncontrolled situations and
getting mobs onto the paladin and off the squishy people. Paladins can't
really keep it going for long during a real fight with AoE damage because
the high mana cost, combined with their low mana pools and not medding
during combat, run them OOM too fast. In my opinion, the group HoT would
have a much lower aggro to it and would work much better in AoE situations.
It's efficient.

    You're correct. Just us two, and clerics don't use the group heals that
often until the level 57 one.

    I want them to get one. They don't want one, because that wouldn't let
them try and replace a cleric in healing a main tank during a boss mob
encounter. Which is funny, as my guild's druids said when the 75% CH came
out that they'd all rather snort drain cleaner than be part of a CH
rotation. But we've made some of them play clerics in rotation for 30 minute
boss fights, so they know how bad it can be. ;-)
