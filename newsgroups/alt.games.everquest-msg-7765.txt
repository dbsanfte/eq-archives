I'm confused here.  In one post you have no trouble labeling bizbee as
"bad" and yet you have a problem with titan2 labeling Taras' FAQ
campaign as "attempting to host an ALT group".  Either we have the right
to form opinions and express them or we don't.  Either you have the
right to make the assertion that biz is "bad" and titan2 can assert that
Taras is "attempting to host", or if titan2 is somehow forbidden from
expressing that belief then you are equally forbidden from expressing
your opinions on biz.

So unconfuse me... how is your expression of your belief valid while
tatan2's is not?
