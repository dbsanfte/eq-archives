Prices are high right now, due to everyone trying to skill up past those
levels.  It'll settle down soon, hopefully.    But at the moment the
interdependence is driving the market more than a bit crazy.   All of the
trade classes are busy gouging each other unless you have several friends that
want to craft as a group, or are willing to raise up some mules.

5s is high for a quill though, and 6s for the paper is outrageous.   One
chemical and one foraged component in the paper.   I personally sell mine for
2s when I make it... but up to 3s is probably reasonable.

Try checking the broker at other times, rather than just buying whatever is on
there, and assuming it must be going rate.    Or ask in the crafting channel
if anyone wants to trade scholar products for paper or quills.

Perhaps the App 3's you're seeing sold for 3s are the tier 1?   Those are made
quite a bit cheaper....
