    High Keep goblins work like this: there are four rooms in the basement,
called (on Quellious) Lookout, Guard, Warrior, and Raider, based on the type
of Pickclaw Goblin that spawns within. Lookout contains three spawns, Guard
has four, there are two spawns on a small staircase leading down to Warrior
(which are usually split between Warrior and Raider), three spawns in
Warrior, one spawn outside Raider, and three in Raider. All are static, and
on a ten minute timer. For most people that go there and group, the mobs in
a room will be even cons or higher - fighting them when they're red is
common, they aren't very tough for the level.

    The standard KS scenarios that arise in High Keep are as follows:
(1) Someone decides the stair spawns are theirs, since nobody is standing
right on top of those spawn points.
(2) Warrior and Raider bicker over who gets the stair spawns.
(3) The Guard group is also pulling from Lookout / the Warrior group is also
pulling from Raider, and someone moves into the extra room.
(4) (Variant of (3)) A high-level player, to whom the goblins are low blues,
moves in and starts soloing.
(5) Osargen, a static level 24ish rogue mob on a 6 minute timer in a remote
part of High Keep, is frequently soloed by people or pulled to the Guard
group. Disputes break out over him all the time - think the hermit in South
Karana.

    High Keep is an XP camp - nothing special drops there, unless you
consider small bronze "special" - but the spawns are VERY static. This isn't
like someone taking "your" wanderer pull in Dreadlands - KSing in High Keep
will make a large impact on the affected group's XP, because of how few
spawns people kill per 10 minute cycle.

    What a player thinks is killstealing and what a GM will call
killstealing differ. And you can even enforce both definitions, if you know
what you're doing. My mage used to camp Osargen, and people would come and
try to horn in all the time. Killing one high blue per six minutes is a
leisurely pace, but one high blue per 12 minutes is unacceptably slow, so
the KSers have to go.

    One person came in, and asked to alternate spawns. Because of the nature
of the camp, I told him "no" and then informed his guild that he was trying
to move in on an established camp. They asked him what was up, and when he
told them they told him to get the hell out of there. They knew not to
interfere with an established camp, and I knew talking to them would be the
fastest way to get the person out. I felt bad for the person - if the spawn
timer had been faster I'd have gladly invited him to share spawns or group
for a while - but when you're already doing a marginal camp you don't give
up any of it.

    The next bozo walked past me and sat down right beside the spawn point,
hoping to get first aggro on him. These are the players that annoy me the
most. I was outside the spawn area (Osargen spawns inside a jail cell-like
area), and when the spawn timer was up I came to outside the bars and
unloaded on Osargen as only a mage can. My kill, by a mile. He immediately
shot me a "you just KSed, and I'm petitioning" tell, to which I responded:
"I'm sorry, I didn't see you there because of the bars on the cell. I
wondered why he didn't come right at me like he has every other time for the
past two hours! Would you like to come to a sharing agreement where you'd
get one spawn every twelve minutes, just like me?" He realized *I* knew my
GM-fu and could force him into a sharing arrangement that would result in
crap XP for both of us, so he left. You just have to figure out the
psychology of the person trying to move in, and use the best method to apply
pressure on that person.
