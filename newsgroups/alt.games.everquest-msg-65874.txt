Ahh, I just figured it would be a bench mark program as 3dmark2001 was
recommended over it.
Might take look at that but, to tell the truth, I know if the game is
unplayable or not and if I need to turn somethings down. The only place I
care for the FPS figures is in Q3 (where I have plenty now, anyway) but that
was because you are always tweaking you cfgs etc to get the best
performance/Visibility compromise, although generally better visibility
means more FPS anyway.
