They just hate you. Getting into Cabilis as a Non-Iksar requires you to
kill about 1000 - 1500 Goblins/Sarnaks or so. And that is just one
faction. In a second step you have to hand in about 2000 - 4000 bone
chips to get happy with the other faction. And then theres a few
factions more that you can't raise at all. I figure it's about
the same with Paineel people.
