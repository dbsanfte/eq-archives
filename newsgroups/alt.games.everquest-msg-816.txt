Let's not forget decreased downtime for needing to expend less mana and/or
taking less damage.  Rather than taking twice as long for either of them,
together they can probably do it in about 1 1/2 the amount of time.  So, if
dudeA takes 2 hours to kill the 20 mobs solo, together they could do the 24
in maybe 1 1/2 hours.

I soloed a few levels as a rogue, but when I partnered up my downtime
(surprise!) was significantly less.
