Lute of the Jharin Apprentice.
Vah Shir bard only
Primary slot string, no stats.

Since "quality" of strings seems to matter to practically no spells at all, this
newbie level item is usable up till you get your epic (functions as all
instruments including strings)

Better would be a primary/secondary string, I carry an orcish lute for when I'm
swapping strings with drums or some such foolishness.  Primary slot drum would
make my day, I could keep my troubador mace in hand for the rest of my operating
(pre epic) life and swap only in primary which would make life sooo much
simpler.

I know, Selos Drum of the Beast.  Try buying it, or getting my guildmates to go
hunt one for my alt (not a happy lot when one of their clerics is playing an alt
instead of helping them do some boring thing for the 500th time)
