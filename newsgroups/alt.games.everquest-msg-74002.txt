Here's how you get out of VP:

1.  Two clerics and you are in VP, you want to leave the clerics stay.
2.  All three are bound at the same place.
3.  Cleric one dies, pops up naked at his/her bind point.
4.  You die, pop up next to cleric one.
5.  You make a second corpse and leave it there.
6.  Cleric two rezzes your (dressed) corpse in VP.
7.  You loot your stuff.
8.  /tell Cleric_One Rez please.
9.  You get rezzed out of VP.
10.  Cleric_One tells Cleric_Two rez please.
11.  Both clerics back in VP and you're at your bind point fully
dressed.

Of course, if everyone wants to leave, the process is similar just
scaled up.  The tricky part of course is the last cleric to leave the
zone--they usually eat a real death and get a 96% exp rez back.
