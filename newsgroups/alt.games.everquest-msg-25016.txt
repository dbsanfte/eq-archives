Wouldn't fear kiting Griffenne at 26 qualify as cheap easy lazy, and
Great XP?? or does the short run to find more make it too hard.  In that
case how bout fear kiting mammoths in Everfrost.  Oh, no, thats too far
from a port.  

Aviaks stopped being great xp for ME at 22/23.  And that was soloing the
arena with a ranger.

BAH, Whatever.
