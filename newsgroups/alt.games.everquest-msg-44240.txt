You may not need an EVACER but they sure make things alot easier,
especially if camping something "inside" the dungeon, ie Effretti room
in Sol B.  You can fight your way back out, but it's much nicer if you
can just evac out, Same with Lower Guk, etc.  Snare is also nice in
dungeons as it keeps mobs from running.  I agree with your statement
that druids get chosen behind some of those others you have listed, but
I think that has as much to do with the number of druids who get to the
high end game with no clue how to group, or what their role should be,
so people dont want to group with them, and they get a bad name as the
result of stereotyping.
