Ok.  I understand the raid leader to be 'up to speed' on this little 
trip, so hopefully they will tell me where go.  Politely of course :)

Er, no!  With regard to mana regen, is it the sort of place where use of 
a mount is OK or would that just get in the way?  I am thinking that 
sitting is going to be a baaaaad idea.

high level raid group at all.

OK.  What is the accepted protocol for casting gate (selfish!) Or 
succor?  Would this be called by group or raid leader or just not 
bothered with?

Thanks to you all for your comments btw :)
