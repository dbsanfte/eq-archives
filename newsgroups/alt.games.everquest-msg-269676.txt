They (sony) need to change the questbook sorting.  Do you really care where 
you got the quest? No...you want to know where you need to go to 
collect/pick-up/talk whatever to move the quest along.  I wanna know, if I'm 
standing in North Qeynos, all the quests that need me to do something there. 
I hate having to read through all 50 quests trying to pick out the ones that 
are nearby.  Maybe it was too difficult because as you progress through the 
quest, it would move into different categories...
