I think your experience does not relate exactly to the subject at hand.  In
your case it was an anonymous caller that you had no control over.  In the
case at hand every member of the guild at that raid knew what was going on,
and likely everyone not at that raid also knew the kinds of things their
guild pulled.  If your example was something like where you and your army
buddies knew the call was being made it would relate better, and I would
think the punishment appropriate (for the army).
