The other warrior and I have a problem in Dalnir's.  After you zone in, 
there is a small room that a lot of people pull to.  After that, there is a 
twisty passage that leads into the interior of Dalnirs 1st level.

In that twisty passage, the other warrior and I get dropped to the desktop 
a -lot-.  Same spot.  There's also a place in the "L" where it happens - 
same result.

No one else we play with ( about 8 different people that we group with down 
there, now ) has that problem.  We are the only warriors, but that can't be 
it.  So, I asked him about his computer specs.

The only thing that our machines have in common are a SB Audigy and Win2k 
for me and XP for him.  Other people that we play with have Audigys, but 
are running ME or 98, and they don't have problems.

I'm going to /bug this, but wanted to know if any of you fight in Dalnirs 
and have this same problem.  If so, are you running a SB Audigy or Live! on 
XP or Win2k?
