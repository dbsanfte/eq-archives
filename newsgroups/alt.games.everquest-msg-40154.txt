Agreed so far, except there is a fourth method, making the creature
involved hard to kill. The example I gave is Derakor the Vindicator -
check a Kael spoiler site if you don't know who he is.

Noone on any server has ever camped the Vindicator. But he has been
killed, and some people have his items, which they consider extremely
valuable. So there we have camp time = 0, number of items > 0.

Let me know if you want me to explain that again.

With the TCC rules you can have lower level mobs like the vindicator,
without worrying that a single higher level will come in and kill it.

My main is level 55, I don't spend any amount of time playing low level
characters at the moment, although I might if the TCC actually works out
(I doubt it, people like you will doubtless force Verant to give in, and
then continue to whine about long camps).
