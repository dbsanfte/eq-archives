So Lokari the Troll has decided to again snip what she said, snip the proof
that what she said was wrong, and try to deny that what she said was flat out
wrong. Typical, typical response form a Usenet self-appointed Ms. Know-it-all.




================================================

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."
