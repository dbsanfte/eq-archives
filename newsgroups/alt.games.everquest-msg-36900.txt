Heh... I've been playing RPG games for years and EQ for about a year and I
still consider myself a newbie... It's all relative... some ppl are masters
after a couple months... some are still stupid after years and years heh

I play an 20 enchanter and 10 monk so I don't really know all of Norath. But
personally I play near and around Freeport mainly. Nro is good up till about
13 and then from there I went south to Oasis till about 16. I then went with
some of my guildees to Lake of Ill Omen and despite a bad start am begining
to like it now that I'm 20 on my enchanter. My monk is still in Nro. Like I
said... still consider myself a newbie so other ppl probably know better
places for ph4t l33wt
