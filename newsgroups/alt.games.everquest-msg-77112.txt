I understand pop-ups being the only reliable revenue. However, I think
flinging up to FIVE of them at me on a single page change is absurd. I
don't think that my decision not to fork over money to them over this
is "asinine". I think it's not giving in to what is comparable to
being held hostage. "Ya don't want a flood of popups? Give us money!"

A popup here and there is fine. EZBoard went OVERBoard with them,
though. That is why they're not getting my money.
