Not to be offensive, just pointing out a basic fact: You need to learn to
be a better shaman. Whenever my hp bar is higher than my mana bar, I
cannibalize. Period. If circumstances require that I go through a lot of
mana, I'll cannibalize down until my hp bar is invisible and have a cleric
CH me back up. I've never died as a result. All it takes is learning how to
properly manage your aggro, and grouping with more competant melee
characters, cause if the melees you group with can't keep a mob off you
just because you sat down, they REALLY suck.

>>Shamans cannibalize to get their mana back much, much faster
