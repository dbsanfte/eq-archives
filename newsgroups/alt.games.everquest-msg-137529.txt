Could anyone possibly throw out some Item names and what they go for
at a vendor....   Im not really versed in it but some common items
that sell for a good bit at the vendor.
Id like to dive into someones trader and make a profit as well, but my
economics skills are somewhat lacking.
Like the above two items lited... Kunzar cloak and the Forest Loops.

i.e.
jewelcraft items .... what they sell for to vendor:

Quindell 52 High Elf   Cleric
Yute 33 Dwarven   Rogue 
Fulcon 30 Wood Elf   Druid
Sekani 30 Iksar      Monk
Yizzan 21 Eurdite     Necro
Beltain 12 Barbarian  Shamman
         Quellious

Light travels faster than sound; 
so some people may appear bright, 
until they open their mouths.
