Definately for roleplaying. Characters with a purpose make them for me more
fun to play. Read the old Kunark Players Guilde about warriors and under
Wood elf and Dark elf, the idea might be to make a warrior with such high
defensive skills (high AGI) that they're never hit or, in the case of the DE
specifically, more resistant to mind control.

Ultimately, I might play with the stats and play the character over 5
different ways to get an idea what seems to be the best path: high agi and
dex, or high sta, or s broad spread.
