We had a group in Dalnir, when one of the warriors (who had been going AFK unannounced for short periods of time) went AFK and didn't
respond for almost 30 minutes.  When the group finally disbanded, we had to leave him there.  About an hour later, I'm besieged by angry
tells from the guy that he died and "HAD TO GET BACK TO HIS CORPSE BECAUSE HE HAD 30K WORTH OF EQUIPMENT ON IT."

I was sympathetic - it was too bad he screwed up that way - but his attitude was quickly eroding my desire to help him.  As it turned out,
there wasn't anything I could do, anyway.  I assume he _did_ manage to get his stuff back.  

One further thing.  I ran into him in the EC tunnel weeks later, and he was begging for equipment and food.  I guess some people never
learn.
