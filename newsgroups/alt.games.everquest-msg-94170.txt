Why is it about doing something *better* then another class?  Druids have
always been about diversity.. you might not be the best in a given area, but
your spells cover almost all areas of most classes

SoW, Night vision (wolf form/SoE) levitate, root, snare, nukes, dots, pb
ae's, buffs, clarity (potg), resists (circles/seasons), regen, heal, damage
shield, ports, several debuffs (lower ac, atk, resists......)

>Healing...forget it, we know who is better.

So a spell isnt worth having if your not the "best" at it?  Shrug say
goodbye to your wide range of spells then.  A 60 druid kept my 60 monk
healed better last night while factioning in droga (yes green con, but the
whole zone is a death trap) then a cleric could have.  Not once for several
hours did the druid go oom, including casting potg/rotg (from his bp),
nukes, snare, ds and keeping me alive with 8 HTing goblins at a time

> Damage shield?  ask a magician.

Your 60 DS is 32 damage, a mages is about the same - whats the difference?

> Nukes  -- to many options.

huh?

> DOTs, again...  we come in real close with a shaman but don't have haste
nor
> slow.

And shamans dont have ports, nukes, pbae's, clarity for others... whats
haste or slow got to do with dots?

If you have an empty character slot, click on 'create' and go through the
process of making a druid.... then report back what difficulty level a druid
is given..............................................
