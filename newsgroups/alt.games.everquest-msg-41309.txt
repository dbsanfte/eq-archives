    Later on, you state that one can only reach mid-levels in the inner
region. Doesn't sound like one can avoid being in PvP-enabled areas.

    Now, what I understand of the game is this: if another realm captures
your artifacts, either they gain attributes or you lose them (not sure
which). So people are pretty much forced to enter PvP combat and defend
their artifacts to avoid a power loss.

    This also means that the powerguilds I mentioned in an earlier post will
be HUGELY motivated to power up as quickly as possible and nab another
realms' artifacts before the other realm can do anything about it, then beat
them silly by keeping complete control of the outer region area. And if your
side can't stay in the outer region long enough to level up (since you can
only reach mid-levels in the inner region) because you're being actively
PKed by folks that already have an intrinsic advantage over you because of
the artifacts, then you can never get those artifacts back. And you thought
being first on a new EQ server was important!

    It will be a guild raid. Big EQ guilds have between 50 and 80 people
(possibly more accounts), and supposedly the toughest mobs will require 16
people to take down. So other than bringing double that to a fight and
crushing the mob in question, what else will a big raiding guild (EQ-style)
do? That's right, send gank crews to the other realms to make sure nobody
challenges them.

    From what I've heard and seen so far, DAoC isn't so much a new game as
an attempt at "fixed EQ". Some of the fixes are quite innovative (a lot of
tradeskillers are raving about the new tradeskill engine). However, I think
a game that wasn't self-motivated will end up suffering from content
problems. Already people are complaining on the DAoC boards about how boring
the game is - we'll see if there's a fix for that coming soon.
