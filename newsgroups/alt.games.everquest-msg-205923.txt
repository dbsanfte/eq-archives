Hi All

I'm fairly new to EQ (since Jan). I play a cleric and do the usual pickup
groups to xp. I'm still in the learning stages of how other races and
classes play their roles in a group. I think I have it down, and as I gain
levels as well as others, their skills and abilities have grown and change
and so can their roles in a group. However, I frequently run into this same
problem: I join a group and it runs smooth, good pulls, crowd control, etc.
Then as usual, people come and go in the group and the group has almost
completely turned over people. Now someone says "whose the puller" a lot of
the times position are decided instantly and off we go and at other times
someone else says "I don't know, why don't you do it".  another says "I
don't have enough armor, not me, let Bubba do it, what do you think?....."
...  "who will be the MT"......"....Not me..George you do it...."    At this
point, if I knew the best basic grouping I would assign rolls myself.  I
assumed that the different classes would know their abilities and usual
position in a group.

My request:

I would like a suggestion that I could use to decide for these people.  I
would like a list of 2 or 3 classes for each position; the Puller, MT, and
MA.  That way I could tell who to play what position and get things moving
with the most efficient combo.

Thank you in advance for your time for any suggestions.
