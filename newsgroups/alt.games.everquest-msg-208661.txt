This change looks to be recent. My Gnome Wizard was created in January
of this year, and I remember tearing the hair out of my RL scalp looking
for the kobold ones. I also remember rather large trains while hunting
in that area.

I went back last night, and yes indeed they are all indifferent to me
and of the 4 kills I made, 3 dropped scalps. Have they trivialized all
of the Newbie quests to the level of those in Halas? The Gnome quest was
certainly much more difficult earlier on. I rather enjoyed the quests I
have done up to this point, but after completing the Barb Shaman quest
in under an hour, I was left with zero sense of satisfaction. My Gnome
was extremely proud the day he killed those evils to get his book and
complete his initial quest.
