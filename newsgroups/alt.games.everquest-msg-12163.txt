I might have had it happen to me twice since I started playing in January.
Seems that a friend of mine was complaining of it and remedied some of the
problems with zoning my putting his ISP's DNS server IP address in their
proper place in his settings. The default way that his ISP had him set
everything up with his DSL account required that these fields be left blank.

I'm just going off memory here, as it's been a while.
