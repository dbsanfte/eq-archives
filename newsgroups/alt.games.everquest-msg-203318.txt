Let me give you an example... Suppose I'm asked to port someone to Misty 
Thicket. That particular spell is on my *third* spread of transportation 
spells, as I almost never use it. So in order to memorize and cast that 
spell I have to:

Empty a spell slot
Change to hotkey bank 2 (travel spells aren't on my main hotkey bank)
Click on my "travel" hotkey
Turn page
Turn page
Drag spell to spell gem
Close book
Cast

With the new system, I have to

Empty a spell slot
Navigate the menus until I find that spell
Cast

Navigating is the most time-consuming part, but I'm getting pretty fast 
at it as I learn where each spell is located.

For a spell that's located on the first page of one of the shortcuts 
that I keep on my main hotkey bank, the difference isn't terrible, but 
for more obscure spells, it's an absolute godsend.
