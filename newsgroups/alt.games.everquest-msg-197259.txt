Re: what the game was designed for, I agree with dstep.

What it has become now is because of, in my opinionated-one word: economy.
A while back a guy came to my guild's message boards asking for replies to
research for his....(some of y'all know what I'm referring to already)
master's thesis.  In it, he correctly described the economy of EQ to be
greater than some 3rd-world nations.

P.S. In unrelated news, a long while back I created-and-participated-in a
long scrum here about Verant charging a monthly for SWG to existing EQ
customers.  Does anyone still have that in their Outlook?
