The necklace is currently broken.   When SoL was first released, the
Amulet gave positive faction to all factions in the game instead of
just the ones intended.   So, obviously, VI "fixed" it:  the Amulet now
doesn't seem to modify any faction at all.

At least that's been my experience with it post "fix."   (The fix was
mentioned in a patch message, BTW.)   I also seem to recall reading
that it was now broken, but can't remember where....
