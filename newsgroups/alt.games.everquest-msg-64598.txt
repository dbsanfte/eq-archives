I was just wondering how much time everyone else has remaining?  So far I have
had three different times in the past hour...22 hrs...40hrs...and even 100 hrs!
I have a dial-up connection so that explains it a little....but 40 hrs? 

/shout FIX THE BOTTLE NECKS!!!

I have been trying all day!! What ever happened to good ol' mirrored sites? or
FTP servers? I'm so sick of patches! Who do they have writing the code....and
why do they still have a job? But they have the bull by the horns.....what can
you gonna do except not play. 

The worst part is ....I know as soon as I finally get the patch.....SOMETHING
ELSE IS GONNA GO WRONG......I can count on it!....Just read all of the other
postings!!!

......., 
   bored
