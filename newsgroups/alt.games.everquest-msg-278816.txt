I just googled for "RP".

First hit was something German that I can't even figure out where the "RP"
comes from.  Second hit Roaring Penguin linux distro.  Third hit RP
electronics.  Fourth hit RP International, which ironically enough is about
some sort of disease but doesn't say what "RP" stands for.  Fifth hit
Republic Polytechnic school.  Sixth hit RAC Route Planner.  Seventh hit
Radio Paradise.  Eighth hit Representative Poetry.  The first "RP" that
stands for roleplaying (context told me what you meant...   imagine that)
came at hit 31.

Damn abbreviations.  =P
