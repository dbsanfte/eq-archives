Hi,

I've looked all over for this information, but have come up blank.

I'm trying to organize my gazillion social buttons for my bard so that
I can find them easily, when I'm arranging a bank for hot keys for a given
situation.

In my .ini file, I found the Social Key settings, and that all
seems pretty logical, but when I look at the hot key settings, I haven't
been able to figure it out.  I get something like this (from memory since
I'm not at home at the moment):

[hotkeys]
Page1Button1=E65
Page1Button2=E48
Page1Button3=N14

What are these E and N codes.  Anyone have a clue?

Thanks in advance

Corey
