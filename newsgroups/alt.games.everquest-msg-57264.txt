Well all the sewer vendors are on Bloodsaber faction I believe. I think the 
easiest way to raise this, at the expense of Guard and Pally factions, is 
to use whatever means necessary (invis I guess, plus you'll probably want 
to get an enduring breath) to get past the guards and NPCs topside and go 
sit in the Pool of Life outside the Temple of Rodcet Nife. Now kill all the 
Koalindl fish that spawn there (2 spawn there, on about a 10 min spawn 
cycle) - bonus is you'll make friends with lots of enchanters if you let 
them loot the fish corpses for the Stein of Moggok quest. These fish are 
holy or something, and have *huge* faction hits against the pallies when 
you kill them, so I'm guessing the positive Bloodsaber hit is pretty 
sizable too.

Just make sure to stay on the far side of the pool from Enik Ruklin, or he 
won't be best pleased at you killing his fish - making a non-KOS mule to 
learn the path the fish swim and where is and isn't a good place to attack 
them is a good idea.
