My SK partnered with a warrior, and since we weren't fear kiting, 
healing was an issue just as it would be for either of us soloing.

My only "heal" throws 30 points to my target by stealing it from me, so 
no net gain there, and my other HP gaining option is to steal it from 
the mobs I'm fighting, a whopping 12 points at a time.  I used both of 
these, depending on the fight, if I was getting low on HP I'd steal 
some, if my buddy was getting low, I'd feed him some of mine.

Stealing was a bigger net gain than feeding; both cost mana, but in the 
case of stealing, I'd gain some, my buddy wouldn't lose any, so we were 
ahead, and the target would lose some, so we were further ahead. 
Trouble with that math is that at 12 hp per cast, it was probably 
costing some DPS since I do better than that by hitting the target in 
melee.  I'm thinking, though, that the bigger the group, the less 
important my own DPS becomes, and the more using this to help keep the 
MT (which would in this case be me) alive, helps.


Bandages are a big deal.  We could both sit and bind our own wounds, of 
course.  But then we added a trick, when we got to 70%, I'd use Dark 
Embrace to speedily heal him up to nearly full, simultaneously lowering 
me down well under 70% again (down to 40% more or less, since we both 
had roughly the same HP total); then we'd both bind wounds on me till I 
got back up to 70%.  This way, we got up to 170% of our max hp instead 
of just 140%, and I usually made the mana back up from the casting in 
the time it took us to bind wounds the rest of the way... plus more BW 
skillups.

We tried the healing potions, but they weren't suited to grinding exp, 
at least not without a huge fund behind you.  They give you a short term 
HOT thats good for perhaps 20% of a HP bar, usuable every 2 minutes. 
Now it did take more than 2 minutes to get ourselves reinjured again 
sufficiently that we needed to do the BW thing again; if money were no 
object, the trick would be to do as above, then for me to swig a potion 
and get myself up to 90% quickly, leaving us at an even better start at 
190%.

As it was, we reserved them for emergencies, swigging one if we got into 
a fight and it didn't look like we'd manage to survive it.  Of course as 
an SK, I had a couple other tricks up my sleeve; harm touch can rapidly 
turn the tide, and Fear can turn overpowering force into one at a time 
killing too (although in many zones, it will likely lead to a disaster 
when it breaks, unless you just run for the zone line when it gets that bad.

Now that I'm 24, another possible plan occurs to me; I could use Dark 
Embrace to feed most of my HP to my partner, then FD to drop aggro on 
myself.  I'm not sure thats really a viable plan, though, because it 
would also drop our DPS by more than a third; my pet would still be in 
there swinging, but he's definately not the equal of either of the two PC's.
