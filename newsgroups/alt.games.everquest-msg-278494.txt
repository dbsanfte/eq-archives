Of course "Mary" and "Rick" in an indian call centre talking broken 
english reading out of a book of troubleshooting scripts are not 
"technicians". :)

Unfortunately when you call "tech support" that is often who you are 
dealing with, and sadly is all many companies even employ.

A good company has real techs available. 

Of course, I don't begrudge them a buffer of flunkies to shield the 
sanity of the real techs from the idiots with their non-functioning 
unplugged printers, thier modems plugged into the network port, and 
generally impaired knowledge of right and left, or where the Start Menu 
usually hangs out...

All I ask from a good flunkie is that he recognize that I might know 
more then him, take me through his book of "magic-troubleshooting-
scripts" as quickly as possible and escalate me to a real tech when its 
done with a minimum of fuss.

In a perfect world, I'd want to skip the magic-scripts entirely, but if 
I could skip them, so could the idiots, and there goes the sanity of the 
techs I want to talk to, so I'm willing to jump hoops for a couple 
minutes.
