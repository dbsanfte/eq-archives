My lvl 14 druid met that shadow guardian to, got hit for like 200 dmg
in like 2 seconds, i did jump the raft then run across the island, it
never followed not shure why.

Normally they don't see trough invis but if you are on it's hate list
before going invis, maybe they do, only thing that sees trough invis
is the kromrif elite in EW, and lodizal i can guess a lvl 60 turtle :)

Hope you did find some nice things at the merchants up there, a
coldain velium scimitar would be nice, but it costs a bit to much
right now.

I have now left GD after some bad luck, like going LD after i managed
to pull a yellow that resisted, send pet on him then i did go LD..

If you are on Antonius Bayle send me a tell and i would be glad to
team up with you hunting the tizmaks :)

/Regards Berth
