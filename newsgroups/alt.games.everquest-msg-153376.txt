I know "I have no problems" type replies are useless to you, but I
have no problems.  Except as someone mentioned, after every patch you
get hung up while a background screen asks if its OK for this 'new'
app to access the Internet.  However, if you click on the EQ screen
you can briefly see the NIS screen.  I have gotten good at using the
keyboard to choose the correct answer while mouse clicking to strobe
the screen.

I guess I realy just wanted to share my annoyance.  I'm not sure what
trouble your having.  I also use the Antivirus feature with no
problems.  

Win98.....I just can't let go.
