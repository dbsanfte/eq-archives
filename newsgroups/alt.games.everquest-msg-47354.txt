You chose to go on the attack with no provocation in two posts, the rest is
history. You chose to do it, you chose to attack. Don't blame me.

I think you have it quite wrong, I felt the need to give people some tools
and options, also telling them wheat i intend to do, and am simply defending
my positon from people like you calling me an idiot. I think you are walking
a line of hypocrisy myself but that' your choice.

It *IS* the rest of your life. As technology increases, as more things are
available to less secure states, this will become more freaquent. Surely you
have thought this through and not simply rested on your laurels of false
safety we have been given (by those who made the sacrifice and other
countires) the premium of living the last 20 years.

Bob, your problem is you always go off playing devil's advocate until one
day you wake up and realize, oops, I was wrong. Then switch sides. You did
this with Anarchy online, you have most likely done it before. I predict in
days ahead that is going to happen again. Until then I agree to disagree
with you becuase I argue points, and you make it personal without fail. You
aren't worth debating with becuase you feel it's some 8th grade mentality
about insults.
