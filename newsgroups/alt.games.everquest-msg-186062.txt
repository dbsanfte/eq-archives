I realize that, at this point, nothing's going to change your mind, Ed.  I
do, though, feel compelled to toss a few copper into the fray.

To me, this is about as off the mark as romanticizing about the good old
days when we had to move items from our corpses one at a time without having
the ability to right-click autoequip.  I remember when the change was made
to allow us to right-click autoequip to loot our corpses ... someone in this
ng was bemoaning the fact that it took some of the realism out of the game.
The reply was very eloquent ... "You're looting your own corpse.  How real
is that?"

I see the changes in travel as very much the same.  I didn't like the travel
when I had to do it, and I like it much better now that I don't.  I can play
my melees now without having to do much more than keep a SoW potion on me
for the run to the book (and even if I don't have one on me I can still get
there), and I can play my druid or wiz without getting constantly spammed
for ports.

Frankly, and somewhat to my chagrin, EQ stopped being a RPG ages ago (with
the exception of the FV server, which has some great RP-ing on it).  Long
before the travel changes hit production, to be sure.  So, to me at least,
the whole 'RP of Travel' argument doesn't hold much water.

So .... tell me again where making travel easier is a bad thing?

<soapbox>
If we wish to piss and moan about something, I say make the subject how
PLing has ruined the game and what steps can be taken to slow it down.
