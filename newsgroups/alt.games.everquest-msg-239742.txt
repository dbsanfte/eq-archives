Anyone else read the story on the necro boards about the necro who
used Wake the Dead on an enchanter while doing Time and the chanterpet
proceeded to *charm* Vallon Zek?

My guild was doing Aten Ha Ra once and a necro used Wake on a dead
enchanter, who proceeded to root Aten and then mez her. Luckily only
one ranger died to the scrambled aggro....

Lesson to be learned - use Wake the Dead on enchanters during boss mob
fights whenever the raid force sounds like its getting bored! :-)

Jen: He's dead.
Aughra: Could be anywhere, then.
