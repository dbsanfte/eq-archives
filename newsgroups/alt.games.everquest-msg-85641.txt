Ahh.. that brings-back my memories of Byte.  They used to have
beefy technical articles (for a consumer mag) like descriptions
of the "new MIPS R10000" and stuff like that.  Jerry Pournelle's
Chaos Manor's was always interesting to read and even the ads
were "more technical" with small places selling the latest gizmos
and gadgets for your computer enjoyment.

Apparently, they were too "hardcore" and there are not enough
people like myself, so they closed-shop and "offered" to 
convert my remaining subscription to some Winbloze-specific
mag that basically did reviews of Winbloze apps and advertisements.
I told them to basically stuff it and send me my money back.

That was about 10 years ago that Byte was nearing the end...
I have yet to find a replacement magazine that concentrates
on the fun/exploration of using computers rather than "here's
the latest Winzip v100.2 and why you should buy it."

If anyone has any suggestions for me, I'd love to hear them
as well!

Thanks,
Mike
