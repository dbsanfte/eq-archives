Nice generalization, sure to win you brownie points.  I average 15-20 hrs
a week (less than most americans watch tv) and could easily have my
mage (40th) past 50 if I didn't have 3 mid 20's characters on another
server that account for 60% of my played time.  (Heck, my bard had
20+days played at 22 or 23, due to the fact that he was my first and I
had a blast running around Norrath, poking my nose where it didn't
belong, and helping people out.)

They aren't *ineffective*, they're *less* effective.  In raid situations you
want to minimize the number of people you bring (to cut down on lag
and LD's).  That means each slot needs to be filled with the best
for each role.

Healer - Cleric
Tank    - Warrior
Damage Output - rogue/monk

The last one used to be casters, mages in particular were astonishing
at the end game, when the level cap was 50.  Now several melee classes
can do sustained damage far more effectively than a mage, all just
part of the pendulum swing.  On release, casters were the favored classes
in EQ.

With the release of Kunark (and even more so, Velious) VI tried to redress
this balance issue, and a veritable truckload of great melee gear was
introduced, as well as high hit point, high magic resist mobs that needed
steady melee output to take down, which has put many casters at
a bit of a disadvantage.

The promise of Luclin is of items equivalent to the great melee weaps
and melee haste items that overbalanced melee's.

Then the groups passing them up don't know what they're missing.  After 34
particularly - The pet adds a bit of damage output, they *drastically*
reduce
the number of attacks a mob gets, they can use regen + cannabalize to keep
their mana up, they can add quickness.  The biggest problem playing a
shaman is too many options, not enough mana.  Doesn't invalidate the role
of a cleric though - taking the main healing duties off the shaman frees
up mana for the slows/hastes/regens, root parking and backup healing.  In
turn, that frees up mana for the cleric to stun, reducing damage taken
even further.

Actually, the problem is the opposite - there should never be only
one option to fill a role.  There are groups that won't take a chance
on harder mobs unless they have what they "perceive" to be the
required healer (cleric), crowd control (enchanter) and tank (warrior).

Making *any* class indespensable for anything but the highest raid
level mobs is the poor balance.  And VI has redressed this -
they've given better heals to shaman and druids (not CH, obviously),
they un-nerfed the bard mez songs, making them viable
crowd controllers, they improved the defensive abilities of
SK's and Pallies to help them tank better.

Your tone's pretty condescending:  as a 34year old with a full time job,
a part-time load at school, a girlfriend and a circle of friends I go out
with, I'd hardly characterize myself that way, nor would many here.  I *am*
a "casual" gamer though.  All it means is it takes longer to do things
(real time)

I expect to play EQ until I no longer have fun.  A new game would have
to have markedly better gameplay, comparable content, and my
friends would have to move as well to get me to leave before I've
played it out.  (I started the day after release)

Them's the breaks.  I bounced between 30 and 31 many times while
working on my focus item quests.  Sometimes you have to decide what
use you're going to make of the time you do have.  Am I going to work
on a quest (at the risk of losing exp), do I need cash (again, slow/no
or lost xp) or do I just HAVE to have my next circle of spells (steady
exp grind, don't worry about the loot).  You can't let the xp bar dominate
the game, the point is to have fun.

There's a vendor in LoIO somewhere.  As for the rest, not every zone
is going to be convenient - the payoff is far less crowded zones and an
opportunity for enterprising folks to make a few plat by doing ATM runs.

EQ is a dynamic game, it's changed and grown so much in the last 2+
years.  With that change some things that were true in the release
version are no longer completely accurate.

That manual was just a piece of trash from the get go -
inaccurate maps, very little useful information, and poor
descriptions -

Wizards were billed as the masters of damage (ask any wiz
how that plays out now)

Clerics *are* the masters of healing.  They get shared spells
a rank (or more) earlier.  They get CH.  They always heal more
for the same mana.
