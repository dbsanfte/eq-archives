In the end, it may be. 
*sigh*
Pass the heroin. I may as well just give in now to every addictive thing
on the planet. My warrior has not stepped foot in Norrath for over ten
days now, but man......

Nope. Still on Xev. (Yes, I even have a free character slot left.) Thus
far, nobody knows about my "little characters", not guilded, etc. so I
could have some time alone to play and experiment if I want. But if I do
wind up playing one of these others for a while and really enjoying it,
I'd like to have the option of pulling in my 51+ warrior and friends to
obtain some....... help (*COUGH* twink *COUGH*) later on, should I feel
the need. Also have a little bard and a chanter who might see the light
of being above level 9 one of these days.
