Probably not.  But what if they do have a reaction?  The
office -- if it's like most -- WILL call someone to limit
THEIR liability.  That means paramedics, at least, and
probably the police after they find out it was a sealed
package.  And there you are having committed a major
felony...

Lots cheaper to get an insulated bag, a refreezable cold pack
and just take responsiblity for not leaving something you want
in a public place...
