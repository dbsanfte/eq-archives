Avoid the 2 inns closest to the sands, they are guarded by Reskin and Tolus
(25th level militia) and patrolled by Slate (low 40's...42 I think but may
vary) These are referred to as Inns 1 and 2 (inn 3 is at the back of the
zone between orc camps and 4 near WC zone roughly centre) Kill the orcs in
EC and WC for faction, belts can be handed in for Militia faction or Paladin
faction. I say avoid but thinking about that, you should only be dubious to
Militia atm.

Also, there is a hut near WFP zone, in this hut is Rinnea Lightbringer, she
is a cleric and classed as a guild leader and hits for around 400 a blow,
she is Priests of Life faction (Qeynos) so you, unless you make the effort
to kill gnolls in BlackBurrow and hand teeth in, are not likely to be
improving faction there.

Merchants will not kill you even if they con as scowls, only NPC's do so you
prolly found Rinnea.

If you wish to sell then the merchants at the back of the Tunnel (shady, if
alive and his buddies) should buy from you.
