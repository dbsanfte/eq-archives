Obviously, a cleric should buff - and keep the buffs on - the tanks.
But medding every third pull doesn't mean he's a "bad cleric" or
that he's doing something wrong.   It may mean simply that the
tanks he's working with have sub-par AC, for one.   Or that the
tanks are really too low a level to be hunting there, grouped or
not.   Or that the puller is habitually over-pulling for the group.
Or that the casters insist on using the cleric's mana by casting
too early or too often for the tanks to keep agro.

Of course, if he's meleeing, or throwing out nukes, etc. it may be
his fault.   But hearing a cleric go "OOM" may just be a sign that
other parts of the group are bad for the hunting area as well.
One observation I made at that fort with my cleric is that a *lot*
of mages and wizards still don't know how to manage their agro.
When I went OOM, it was either because we'd just been through
an overpull (or being trained, something else that's VERY common
there) or because a caster just soaked up a couple of Greater
Heals by drawing agro off the tanks.   Even tonight in OT, I went
from being consistently at 50 to 80 percent of my mana to a
consistent 50 to 20 percent - or less - simply when a 37 ranger
stopped pulling to let a 32 warrior pull.
