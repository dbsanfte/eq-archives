Well, they did and they didn't.

Way back when, hybrids had *two* mana penalties:

1.  For given character level and WIS (for WIS casters)
or INT (for INT casters), hybrids had fewer mana points
than a "pure" caster of the same level/WIS-INT.

2.  A spell that had a mana cost of, say, 60, would
cost a "pure" caster 60.0 mana points to cast, but would
cost a hybrid caster *more* than 60 (I'm not sure of the
exactly formula, though).

Yes, they did away with mana penalty #1.

No, they did not do away with mana penalty #2.

Also for hybrids, they did away with:

3.  The exp penalty, whereby most hybrids took 40% more
exp points to level than a non-hybrid of the same level.

4.  The casting-while-meleeing penalty, whereby you'd
have to wait your entire weapon delay after a spell had
been cast.

Hybrids still have the following penalties:

5.  Fewer spells than the parent class.

6.  Get spells later than the parent class (sometimes
MUCH later, e.g. Paladins get Divine Aura at 55, Clerics
get it at level *1*).

7.  Can't Bind or Gate.
