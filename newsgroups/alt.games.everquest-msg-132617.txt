While that would be frustrating, it has little to do with the topic at
hand.

Druids are a jack of all trades class.  They don't do any job best, but
they
do a lot of jobs ok.

The druids you are talking about had their job wrong; they were nuking
when their job was healing.

As much as you say "druids are not wizards" you'll hear "druids are not
clerics" just as often.  When there's a cleric in the group, druids heals
are best used for emergencies, slapping a fast one on someone while
the cleric is healing someone else, or on the MA to help him live long
enough for a CHeal... sure, the druid should keep this in mind, but should

spend most of his time nuking or worrying about DS/Regen and snare
or...whatever his real job is.

For our purposes here, the druid would be there as a PBNuker.  I'm
aware she'd not be as good in this role as a Wizard, but on the other
hand we'd... hmm, nothing exciting.  We'd get to have her along instead
of some stuffy wizard we don't know, thats what we'd get.  Less efficient
but a lot easier to trust someone you know.  Oh, and there'd be that
backup heal thing, after all its not as though AOE group is a CHeal
situation.
