Could I just get a show of hands to see how many in this group are
starting a Kerran Beastlord or it's hypothetical equivalent as soon as
they get the new expansion?  Anyone?

Also, what was it like when Kunark came out?  I only got into EQ a
little bit after it was released but they're seemed to be a lot of hyp
about being an Iksar monk.  Anyone see a possible need to make the new
planet PvP to keep the cat population down :) j/k  Anyway, thoughts,
plans on making this new char?  What have you to say?
