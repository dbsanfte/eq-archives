Tell me about it. No matter what they say, "all I want is a sweet guy"
doesn't apply if that sweet guy is overweight. I keep getting told
that I'll make some girl happy someday by all the girls I know, and
how sweet I am (Really, I am much nicer IRL than here. ;-) ). So, ahh,
if I were really so great, why the hell am I still alone? Bah.
