Agreed, although I do miss the face on my Half-Elf Druid.

Nah.  Trolls are suppose to be lean and agile for their size.  And the
tubby, ass scratching trolls (and ogres) just had no menace to them at
all.  Looked way to comic.  My only complaint, for lack of a better
word, about the new troll model is that they look a bit too
intelligent.

I like the change.  Actually, the whole expansion has a significantly
different feel to the original EQ, which I thought was a bit to hung
up on Tolkien[1].

Very choppy until I turned the texture quality down to 'medium', which
seemed to help.

Kind of agreed.  The Erudites have way to impressive a chest to be
wussy boy casters.

Actually, you can change the facial features on your existing
characters.  Stuff EXACTLY like beards, eye color, hair color.  And
you can apparently change it as much as you want, which is good since
the hair is currently bugged.  :-)  You can change your hair and beard
style/color, but as soon as you log or zone it seems to revert back to
the default.  Facial and eye color changes seem to stick though I
think.  My dwarf rogue still only has one eye anyway.  :-)

I wonder what Verant thinks about travels now btw.  The Nexus makes
travel across the old world and Kunark MUCH easier for melee classes.
Really, unless you need to spend time in Timorious, Eruds Crossing, or
OOT, there is no reason to take the boats now.  Unless you need to get
to Velious that is.
