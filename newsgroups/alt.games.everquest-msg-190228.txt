It's NOT just a game, dammit!  Just the other night my BF and I were playing
and he looted a charm.  A charm with wisdom and agility.  It looked like a pile
of sand or something.  He looted before he looked.  He has a million excuses. 
He's a wizard, pretty useless for him.  I'm a ranger.  Do you have any idea how
long this man is going to do without?  :)
