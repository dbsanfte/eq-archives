What's less cool about that?

Well... the obvious solution to that is to remove that power from the 
exclusive domain of 'uber-guilds'.

No single quest should dramatically alter the world. And altering the 
world should not be the sole province of uberguilds.

Maybe. But since he really loses nothing from it, what's the big deal. 
Its not like this random guild is doing it to spite him. At any rate it 
will be balanced by positive changes.

You haven't convinced me that his little elf outpost getting invaded by 
goblins is a screwjob.

Or they'd look forward to logging in to see what's new. I would. Besides 
its not like Freeport is going to change hands every week... there will 
be quite a bit of stability. (And newbie zones and cities would be 
largely static, so that the 'tutorial stuff' doesn't get messed up.)

I seriously doubt the two aspects are directly related though.
