That can *only* be stopped by stopping it before it starts?

Anyway, aside from pouncing on a phrase, let me continue by pouncing on the
thought.

Humans can keep the kittens safe so they don't die, as they would naturally
as a population control.  And then can't keep them safe later on where they
do die.  Seems the problem comes along long before "fixing" the pet is an
issue...
