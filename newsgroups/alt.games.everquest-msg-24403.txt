Aha ! and the truth will out itself .

There really is just no comparison dammage wise . Rogues outdammage
everything by a huge margin . At the high end rangers and warriors do equal
dammage to monks . At the moment there is no niche that a monk fills  so
they are taken only when there is no one better around and you need a warm
body . A pair of monks are sometimes usefull for pulling but verant in its
wisdom has decided that new hard zones will have mobs that all walk back at
the same time or mobs that once pulled out of place stay there till killed .

Class balance is still the most hideous problem everquest faces . On the
bright side the new trivial code they are implementing in luclin may make it
moot for me at least .
