Depends on how long it takes to kill something.

Ensnare lasts a long time 6.8 mins at level 29 to 14.0 mins at level L65.
If you have an affliction extender focus item like the Coldain Military Wristguard
you can add another 10% to the duration. Plus it is a slightly faster cast time.

Basically a very powerful spell. If my druid can snare something I can kill it.
Its just a matter of time. The only exceptions would be a summoning mob or
one with insane regen to overcome the DoTs.
