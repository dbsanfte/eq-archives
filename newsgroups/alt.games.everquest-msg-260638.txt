Hello friends,

I am having an issue that many folks are having.  EQ runs in slow motion
when I play it on my latop now.  I have posted about it 3 times on the EQ
website, with the expected Customer Service.  NONE

I am hoping some computer guru can help me.  One of the suggestions by the
players on the forum is to disable step speed on the laptop BIOS.

Can anyone coach me through this?? I am able to get into the BIOS, but have
no idea what to look for, or how to disable it.

Thanks in advance,
Breslin
