I'm in the same predicament as the OP, and I find the experience at 61 
rather less than awesome. It was great from 56 to 60, no question, but 
it will take around 300 blue kills in PoN to ding 62. It's hard enough 
using charm, so I couldn't even contemplate to use root-rotting for XP 
anymore. The net result is that Hanrahan is pretty much chilling out in 
PoT until his guild catches up and he can start dreaming of Epic weapons 
or fun raids. Until then, back to single-player games. :-/

Life post-60 isn't great for a Druid in a less-than-uber guild, as the 
OP just found out, and it's about to get much worse when they get around 
to nerfing Charm.
