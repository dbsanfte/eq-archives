I wonder if she would be one of those creeps who would charge $10 for
a jug of water in some area hit by a hurricane or something?  (of
course I'm not saying a mere game is as serious as a real life natural
disaster, but you get my drift).  

But I'm just curious about people who choose to play a cleric as their
main character, what's the main attraction?  I would think more often
than not it's because they like to help other people and they feel
happy when they save someone's life, and maybe they don't really care
if they're the big hero and don't mind working behind the scenes (like
a roadie as compared to a rock star).  Or maybe they like to be able
to find groups easily and clerics are usually popular in groups.  

But then I imagine there are a few power trippers who realize some
players (not all) will bend over backwards to be nice to clerics,
porting them for free, etc., because they might need a rez some day
and they want to stay on a cleric's good side.  So there might be a
few bad apples who play clerics and expect everyone to kiss their butt
all the time and threaten to put them on their "no rez" list if they
don't.  This player sounds like maybe she is one of those power
trippers.
