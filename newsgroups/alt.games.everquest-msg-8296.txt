I've got a mid level druid, 30, and here's how I keep his spells
organized:

Page 1/2

All of my constantly memmed spells; the one's I have up all of the
time.  I am only using 7 slots, so there's a few that are still blank.

Page 2/3

The "swap" spells that I use in my 8'th gem slot.  That's where I keep
my self buffs, like strength and skin, wolf form.  The ones that I
always like to have on.  I just swap out the 8th gem so that I'm not
vulnerable when attacked with a bunch of buffs memmed.  I also keep
spells that I might have occasion to use, like Harmony and Gate.

Page 4/5

Commonly used buffs, but ones that I don't always have on.  Stuff like
SoW goes there.

The rest of the book is organized by sections.  I don't remember the
page numbers, but I keep a pair for my animal spells, a pair for my
invis spells, pairs for teleporting spells; I pretty much have every
kind of spell group on an  individual pair of pages.

I also have a set of pages for "junk" spells, like skin on wood, minor
healing, and all of the other spells that I'm never going to use
again.

I have a set of pages in the middle of the book for temporary use.

I have set up many hot keys for the spell book.  For example, I have a
hot key labeled "Default"  When I hit that key, I sit down and open
the book to page 1.  I have a key named "Rings", so when I hit that
key, I sit down and open the book to what ever page I keep my Ring
spells on.  I am using the hot key bank 10 first and working my way
backwards, so I don't have to search for the hot keys.  The nice thing
is that while you are medding, you have 6 hot keys in the bank and you
can use the hot keys instead of turning pages.  If I'm on page 1, and
I want to mem a teleport spell that lives on page 20, all I have to do
is hit the hot key and I go right to that page.

I've got a hot key labeled "Junk" that I originally made for page
49/50, but as I level and get more spells, I've had to shift the hot
key back.

I also have an open page around 30 that I use for a temp slot for
moving around large chunks of spells for rearragement.  I right click
on the spell that I want to move, hit the "Temp" hot key, and I'm on
the temp page where I drop the new spell.

You can use the hot keys any way you want, just be sure to only use
the top six, because you can't see the bottom ones when you're looking
at the book.

I got most of my ideas from www.eqdruids.com.  There is an excellent
section with some very good ideas for book organization.  Should work
out well even if you screwed up and aren't playing a Druid!
