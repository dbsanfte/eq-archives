I gave-up on night-blind characters after my Erudin Necro.  You may
want to take that into consideration.  That being said any available
class can be a good or a great bard.  Myself I went with Half-elf
and started in Qeynos.  My first move was to Barbarian land to
hang-out.  And then to wisp island where I cleaned up easy as P-I-E.
At level 5 you have selos so deaths outside in open area become
"nearly" a thing of the past at that point.

The bard down-side is get ready for some finger work until your hand
aches =).  Your first kites are with bellows and they take a while
to complete and while have you counting and repeating 1-2-2-3-3-1-1
in your sleep. hehe.
