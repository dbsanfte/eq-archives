Its funny I was thinking the exact same thing just the other day.  I was
looking to buy a centi LS, and I do a quick scan of the prices, and I see
one at 1550 on at 1625 and a few at 1900.  I though to myself, wow those
guys are way overpriced.  But then it dawned on me.  They can hold out at
those prices because someone WILL buy it at that price.  The lower priced
ones will get scooped up quickly, leaving nothing but the higher priced
ones.  The demand is steady for that particular item, so someone will buy
those as well, even at the inflated prices.

Reminds me of the Tickle Me Elmo craze a few years back.  I was working at
a retail store and saw the prices jump umbelievably high on those
vibrating annoyances.  The demand was through the roof, so the company
jacked the prices.

That would be hysterical :)  Although... perhaps ractical if they could
set it up where it is a constant scroll of prices set by players to cut
down on the auctioning that is now rampid in that zone.

/set price Lammy, 950pp:Centi LS, 1.5kpp

Then it would queued in an order and just scroll by.
