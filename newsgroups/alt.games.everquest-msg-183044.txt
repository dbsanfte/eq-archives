There are things in the Warrens that will attack a level 30, so there can be
some hassle, especially for a caster, if they get lost.

The annoying part will be the zone out, though, until people get familiar
with it.  Every time I've zoned out from the Warrens to Stonebrunt, I've
ended up next to and facing a wall, and when I've turned, there was no clue
whatsoever what direction would take me further into Stonebrunt, and which
direction would zone me back to the Warrens...and I've guessed wrong every
time.  (I didn't go there enough to actually remember the damn thing).
