Levitate and SoW (and be careful not to let lev wear off).  Once in the
zone, you can also use corpse tricks: die, loot only coin and the no rent
thingy that is part of the quest, die again, loot first corpse.  You've now
got the gold and the no rent part of the quest on a corpse that you can drag
around.

Back before they made no rent items survive going LD, this was a good trick
to use even if you were't worried about encumberance, so that you wouldn't
lose the thing from the shadowed men if you went LD.
