This is where you're wrong since adding the no twink option would not
have caused any significant impact on their player base.  Infact, I
would argue that it would have given a bit more life to the game.

The biggest problem right now with EQ is the fact that the mudiflation
is too much, too fast.  The no twinkie option would have slowed down
the mudiflation to some degree.

You assume that adding the no twinkie option would have hurt their
player base.  I doubt it.
