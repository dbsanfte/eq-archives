Depends on what your loading times were before. If they were more than
30 seconds, then you need to upgrade something on your end to make a
difference, because that's where the problem is. Sorry, SOE is only
responsible for getting better performance out of your system to a
certain extent, after that it's on you.

And if <30 seconds loading time is enough to make you quit EQ, then
you don't have the attention span required to play the game anyway.
