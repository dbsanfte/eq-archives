a friend of mine 52 mage and I 51 mage both summoned 49 earth pets his was
given phantom Plate mine was naked..

both pets were identically buffed but no damage shield.

at the end of the battle where my pet did his ranger imitation his pet was
only at 4% health so im guessing that the armor does nothing in the way of
adding to your pets armor class.
