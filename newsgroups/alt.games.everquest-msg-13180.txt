I think they mostly considered it an exploit until they changed the coding
so that the critters ran like hell away from the hill if you went too far
up.  It's kind of hard to hill-kite a critter if he's out of range by the
time you can get a spell off.  I don't BELIEVE snaring them made any
difference, but I'm old, I forget things.

I used that trick all the time.  Yup, just as a time saver...I wasn't
exploiting a thing.  It earned me no advantage over a critter, since I also
believe they regenned at a big rate.  I just got tired of zoning into
spectres or sand giants with a bubble of health.

Kinda got me killed the first time I took an alt over there to hunt after
they fixed the zone line. :)
