Us shamans don't get a movement reduction spell, and I find that our DD
spell (Direct Damage - Spirit Strike) takes so long to cast that if I try
casting it the MOB always catches up to me by the time I let it off. I think
it would be possible to DOT (damage over time - ie poison or disease for us)
the MOB and run around with it but that would take forever and you risk adds
and kill stealers. A better strategy for us is to place both DOTs on the MOB
along with a root; then just sit and regain mana, casting Spirit Strike
whenever mana gets back up and reapplying root whenever it breaks. Keep in
mind that any spell that causes damage to the MOB has a chance of breaking
the root early, this includes our poison and disease spells.

Don't ever try this as a shaman. You just plain don't have the resources to
do it.

The only reason to join a guild is to get uber gear :). j/k I'm in my guild
for the social aspect of it, I enjoy raiding (when we can get folks to show
up) but I would never leave just because I don't think we've been raiding
enough.

Are the spires still bugged? If not then you have to be careful because it
will try to port you to Luclin even if you don't have the item that allows
you to be ported. And if it tries to port you when (like me) you don't have
SoL installed, you go to the zone's safe spot (this isn't always a safe
place to be).

Can go to Luclin at any level, I guess. Of course, I have never been there
(mutters something about damn AGP graphics under his breath).

You forgot to mention the higher screen resolutions. But, yeah, Velious is
useless until you reach 35.

Which is why I stay away from int casters.
