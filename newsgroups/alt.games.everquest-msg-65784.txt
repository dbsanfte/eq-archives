It's not quite that simple - they are absolutely tiny, not halfling 
sized... my guildmate appeared like this and was smaller than the bag 
graphic for the foraged food he'd just dropped. There's some pics up on my 
guild's web forum (if it will let you view them without being a member). 
Check this link to some pics of a rat-sized halfling druid (Bogas, a green 
wolf due to wearing scarab armour) with me (Elidar) in wolf-form next to 
him for a size comparison:
