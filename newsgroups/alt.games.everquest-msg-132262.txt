You really think it will fail don't you. The thing is people want new.
Just because you are a die hard EQer does not mean everbopdy else is,
just be more open minded that things do change.  Someone buying a new
PC that has never played EQ goes into the game section and first of
will see a lot more boxes of EQ2 on the shelve (this is of couse
taking place after the game is out) than old EQ. It's like that now
without EQ2 , go into a store and look at how many eq boxes there are
compared to newer games. It a big differance. And please doan't say "
Thats because everybody buying it" becasue that not the FACT thats not
what the numbers show.

Wrong again, DAOC didn't work for EQer's because it just wasn't EQ.
But EQ2 "will" be. It's going to be the same world just different
store line behind it. But hey maybe story doesn't matter. I'm betting
that at least 90% of the people that play EQ don't even now the
backgroud story in EQ.And you were the one that gave me the  1 million
number and that is breaking even with the cost of full support, so
even by your calculation EQ will drop in profit. And don't forget the
HUGE Sci-Fi base palyers that are looking forward to Planet Fall.
Star Wars geeks are already going ape shit over SWG and most have only
seen the screenshots.And the EQer who have seen EQ2 know whats coming.
And it's what they wanted. More realistic NPC, better atmoshpere,
better looking charaters , more fluid emotes ( Motion captured) Less
long term Camping ( there will be more than 1 named spawn, say for
example you are hunting AC well while someone is killing one on the
south end of zone another may have popped at same time somewhere else)
Also spawns are not static the are randomize, so just because it pop
at one spot once does not mean it will pop there again. So no more
KSer's wait to jump you spawn.You will be able to buy a house and
store you seriuos gear there if you don't want to put it in bank.
It's just a way better game, you should be more open minded about it
and give it a shot when it comes out. Don't like it then, fine. But
Verant is only giving the public what they want and asked for.

It just can't. It cost a lot to keep everything running smooth. Ok
look I'm going to tell all you guys something right now.
Have you ever wondered why when a patch comes out they never seem to
fix the "BIG" problems. Like they will repair something like "Those
having texture problems with missing hat will now see hats" and
"shadowed men corpses will now remain a full 7 min before vanishing".
Yet quests are still broken, pathing is not fix and that expolt NPC
are still getting people banned. And Just look at last night patch.
Wow!! Now you can change yourcharaters name!!
WooT!! big patch they fixed alot right. But wait theres more.. change
it for a "PRICE", I'll telll you this much , it takes about 5 sec to
change your name to what ever you want it to be.You could in fact even
petition a GM to do it in game if they allowed it. But EQ is NOT
making what it did so they "HAVE" to charge you. But if you Noticed
the Legend Server will change your name for FREE!!! But you my friend
will have to pay $49.95...50 bucks too change each name.
If you want EQ to last You better change all your charaters names and
keep the money rolling in, maybe that way, they can get those zones
that should have been in game months ago patched in , get those pots
that do nothing to work like they sould have a long time ago.
The point I'm trying to tell you is it is costing them money and
resources they want to put somewhere else, so they charge you for
everything.They could do it all for free, hell , you pay 12.99 a month
to play , you should get it for free , but you won't, they need the
extra profit. And think about this , is it really benefical to the
game to have people change there names, No. And why, because now
anybody with a bad reputation can become as clean as the day they were
born. I can KS all I want, rip you off in EC and all I have to do is
pay 50.00 to do it all over agian.This is what I mean by the decline
in gameplay.Things they try to fix make the game worst for those that
enjoy it and better for those that exploit.
