My group "EVAC!" key has always been on hotkey number eight. Ever since
I've had an evac.

There has been more than one occasion when the call to evac came after
I'd hit enter without realizing it. Usually, there's at least one person
(near) dead when I finally start casting the evac after saying, in group
chat,

8888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888
