I play a shaman, and sometimes get in groups with another shaman.  I really
enjoy this, as it gives times to show all that we can do.  With 2 shamen,
you can have one DoTing, and/or nuking and the other healing if you like,
also you have a better chance to keep buffs up.  Most of the time in LDoN,
when the initial buffs wear off, there is not enough mana or time to regen
to be able to fully buff the group again.  Thus the last third of the
adventure is done with bare bones buffs as mana permits.  Having 2 shamen
eliminates this.

Not to mention, you can really utilize the slows / malo / disempower spells
with 2 shamen, where one doesn't have the mana to do all of that AND nuke or
heal.

I see your trio of Mage / Shaman / Shaman as a great possibility, especially
if you team up regularly and get your edges polished.

If you do add a pally or other tank, the potential is great.  I'd even try
some ldon with just the 3 or 4 of you, could be a great exp grind for you.
No repops, can med if necessary, and like you pointed out, 3 pets make great
dps.  The shaman can get in and melee pretty good to if necessary.

I say go for it.  Sounds like a blast.
