Fair play. We all do things differently :) I can't say that I ever had
problems with agro when I was around your level. Sure occasionally taunt
would not work, but it's good to get hit sometimes, increases chance of
defence skill up which is a good thing, and if the mobs are always slowed
before mez is broken it doesnt hurt much.

I played with memblur/flux in UP on mezes a cpl of times, but gave up as
after having to cast it 6 or 7 times and it still not holding made it seem
unworthwhile.

Cheers
