I agree.  And I would add that I hope that Lance, or someone else, is
archiving his posts about Paax.  Just as Monual's pieces are an excellent
"vicarious guide" to how an intelligent person takes advantage of the
tools the cleric class has to offer, Lance/Paak's pieces are turning out
to do the same thing for the shaman class...with even more focus on the
early levels.  I suppose that was the intent somewhat, but I hope you are
saving these Lance. :)
