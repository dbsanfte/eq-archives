Pet pulling looks to be a different problem (although likely in the
same bit of code).  It's a much weirder situation, though, and I don't
have a grasp on why it happens yet.  According to the code, if the
thing aggroing an NPC is a pet, it uses the owner's level to determine
aggro...but that doesn't seem to be what is actually happening so
there's something else going on.  I'd like to get that loophole closed
as well so we're not shutting off one and just having people start
using another extensively instead.
