If you feel the need to "immerse" yourself into a computer game to enjoy
it...Might I suggest you reserve your table at the next Trekkie convention
now...I hear tickets are selling fast...

No matter what you THINK you're going to change by reporting someone because
their stupid character name is Pickachu or some silly shit like that...all
you're doing is making an enemy.

Only way to immerse yourself into EQ is by joining a total roleplaying
server and learning how to speak like Shakespeare...

Maybe you can throw on your bathrobe and carry around your toilet plunger
all day shouting thee's and thou's to really make it realistic...
