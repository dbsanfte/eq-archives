Unless he actually disconnected, FWIW when charmed, you get the LD
indicator after your name, Probably because it's the only way the
computer will recognize you as something to be controlled by the AI.  I
have seen charm last differing lenghts as well.  I think it depends on
magic resistance for duration (like root, there is a chance each tick to
break it).
