She wrote it enough places in between her chipped record chivalry
blathering. Her slave sounds like a fun guy, too - and slave would be
the correct word to describe anyone going for this control freak. 

Heck, you have to read a script to her on the phone, be willing to
move for her and do everything her way, defer to her around the clock,
have no touching till you're married, wear a chastity device to
prevent masturbation before marrying her  - and she *doesn't* want a
BDSM type submissive?

To top it off, she's in love with another man, already has that slave,
and describes herself as fun and easy to be with :)

ROTFL!!!
