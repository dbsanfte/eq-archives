How dare you. Those people in those buildins, and n those aircraft
were civilians, not CIA, not DIA, just people.

I am an American with an European parent and a lot of European
friends. Much of the European news I read with my eyes in French and
in English is appalling from Europe. If you just watch NBC CNN and
read the New York Times, as we say "Duh!" These organizations have an
axe to grind. I like the BBC, but I think it too grinds an axe of
leftist policies. There is nothing cenerist about it, from my
perspective.

We know, how do you know? No evidence that Sadaam is linked to 9-11 is
going to be good enough for you. To you this is an article of faith,
that we mindless barbarians are going to muck up the European vision
for the world.

Nope we are not going to give the third world carte blanche to pollute
as they wish and constrain ourselves to some mystical green agenda.

Hardly. We have ways to drive our SUVs on other fuels. When gas gets
as expensive here due to market forces as it is in Europe (due to
taxes), we will use other sources of fuel. We permit the free market
to make those decisions.

By War? There are much cheaper ways to get oil, even from Iraq. We
have a lot of it, and Russia may have more than the Saudi do. It just
costs money to get it.

You are standing with a killer of civilians as a matter of state
policy?

He gassed entire Kurdish villages, to root out a hundred possible
Kurdish rebels. You think this is about oil?

He uses videotaped rape of women related to dissidents to control them
overseas. You stand with this man?

He often will kill dissidents, thier whole family, in the name of
state security. You believe in death squad justice?

You think the CIA uses these tactics?

I am afraid you don't really. Our guys are there to do a job, and
don't think this is a war for oil like you do. There is more at stake
than free trade.
