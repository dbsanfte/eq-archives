This isn't even "how to play a 55+ rogue on a raid" in a nutshell,
it's the entire strategy.

55+, starting off with a backstab might not get you a nice
500 pt stab, it could end up getting you a 1200+ double
backstab.  Add in a proc and an opening high-damage quad,
and you've already wasted the warrior's first 15 seconds solo
with the mob building aggro.

Evading at every oportunity is just dumb.  If Evade works,
it will get the mob off of you if anybody else is on the hate
list _and_ in melee range.  Pairing with a cleric that CH's
you, if he stands out of melee range, your Evade might
not get a critter off of you due to position.

The only time you need to do full out damage is when you've
got 24 level 60's in Hate and you're just clearing the ground
floor.  Killing the mobs in less than 6 seconds means
that aggro management is pretty moot.  Any other situation,
however, even exp grinding, a rogue MUST learn how to control
his aggro.  The only time you're going to want aggro pretty
much is when something is beating on your enchanter, you
have 1200+ AC, and nobody is off-tanking during an exp
grind.  Getting aggro for the next 4 seconds could be the
difference between healing yourself after the fight (thank
YOU, invigorate!), and doing a long CR deep somewhere
nasty.  Without your EB gear...
