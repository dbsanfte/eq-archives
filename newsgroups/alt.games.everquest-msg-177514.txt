I am sick of soloing.  I loathe it.  I'm not meant to solo.  I'm a 
rogue.  With aego I can do it for awhile, but it's boring as hell with a 
lot of bandaging and down time.  Without aego, it's barely live, barely 
live, barely live, die and lose more exp than I've gained soloing so 
far.  When I feel like going and killing something by myself, I pull out 
my necro, maybe my ranger.  The necro refuses to group (except pity-
grouping with rogues sometimes ;p) and the ranger is reluctant.  OTOH, 
give my rogue a tank and a healer, and she'll be in heaven.  If that LFG 
feature works in spreading people out and trying new zones, I'm going to 
be ecstatic.  I'm also hoping for a couple good new zones when LoY comes 
out.  You know.  Like DSP *without* rockhoppers and wolves that spawn 
when you step on the wrong spot. ;p
