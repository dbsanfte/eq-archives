    If he was a solo caster EQ would seem almost exactly like he describes
it, especially at low to mid levels. There can also be a fair amount of
downtime associated with finding a group if you don't go to one of the
pickup "hot spots", aren't a soloist, and don't have a guild well-suited to
hunting with you. It's the irony that one of Whineplay's talking heads
(Abashi?) noted when the group XP bonus came up: everyone whined about how
boring it was to solo, then went out and soloed anyways because "the XP is
better".
