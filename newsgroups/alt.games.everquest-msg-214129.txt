You cut my line "A lot better?  No, not if its a crappy augmentation. But
marginally better." and then responded as if I'd never made the point.

So you aren't impressed with it being massively better, but it is improved
slightly.

Also, I recall years ago complaining that I'd gotten a weapon with 2 wis on it
that was running 50pp, and the upgrade I could find for it, another weapon
with a wis of 3 was running 500pp.  Huge advance for marginal improvement I
called it.  I got jumped on right and left for failing to understand that its
by getting a bunch of gear each with a little better stat on it that we get up
to the higher levels of "geardom".  One more wis on 10 pieces is 10 more wis,
you see.

So, get +15 AC on every piece of gear you have, does it add up to anything?

If not, is there a stat that -would- be helped by an extra couple hundred
points?

Or possibly not, I still say the 50pp to 500pp jump was a ripoff, and one wis
just isn't important, heck, 10 wis isn't, heck, my shaman is level 51 and
still has under 100 wis and never missed the stuff.

But I'm asking.
