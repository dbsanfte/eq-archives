No camping is allowed by the PnP in EQ.  Whether or not you shouted "camp
check", if he got the first aggro, it is his kill .  You could have asked him
to loot the item you needed and he could have allowed it, but technically, if
you were camping the mob and started to attack a different one, you had
abandoned your camp to start with.
