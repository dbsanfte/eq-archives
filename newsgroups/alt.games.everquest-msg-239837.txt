From the shadows, the mysterious "bob" <darkflame19@comcast.net> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

As I gave up on actually informing you from the start, and was merely
hanging around to humiliate you, your conclusion is correct.


>  apparently, you do not realize that a conversation, ANY conversation,
>can be learned from.

From you, all I would learn is just how pathetic people can get... and
having been around usenet a long time I was already more or less aware
of that.

I am insulting you for your idiotic idea you think not using
capitalization is "art".


>so i bringing this to a close.  go ahead and say whatever you want.

Always do, chum.

It would be pedestrian to mention the obvious.

Welcome to usenet.

>you to), but expect no more from me.

Somehow I will find the strength to carry on.

I am very accepting of arguments and behavior that has basis in logic.
I have little but contempt for those who try to show they have some
kind of superior attitude when they don't demonstrate any
understanding of the topic at hand.

Your understanding of both writing and art is terribly, terribly
flawed. I think you got a glimpse of that when you realized you
couldn't answer any of the points I was raising. In fact, I believe
you were gambling that I wouldn't try to call your bullshit if you
made the post long and winding enough. Problem is, you're too much an
amateur at that to manage it; I've typed replies that were thousands
of lines long without ever losing my logical train.

You were out of your league.

The problem, which you still haven't grasped, is that *you* are not
one of those people. You don't understand what you're doing. You just
see someone else do something "cool" because its a "rebel" thing to
do, and mimic it.

If at any time you showed any ability to explain *why* you did things
the way you did, other than "because its artistic!", maybe you would
have gotten somewhere.

Too late for that now, though. Even if you tried to explain it in
those terms, you couldn't be taken seriously now that I've had to lead
you by the nose to the trough....
