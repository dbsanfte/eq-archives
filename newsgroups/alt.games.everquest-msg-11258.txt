Yes.

/petition is only for:

  1.  Bugs that you need help recovering from.  For example, if
      your corpse had fallen under the ground or gotten irretrievably
      stuck in a wall (this happens, but quite rarely -- usually
      people THINK this happens more often than it actually does,
      whenever they can't find their corpse right away).

  2.  Stopping another player from breaking the "rules of conduct".
      In this case, the GM's act like the "police".

  3.  When the system announcement asks you to /petition for
      certain special cases (e.g., trading out old quest helms
      for new, improved ones).

In your case, dying and having trouble finding your corpse (or
even not being able to get back to it before it decays and
vanishes) is not a /petitionable problem, it's just a normal
part of normal gameplay.

But there are several ways (in-game) to make corpse recovery
easier, as other people have already mentioned.

Also, be aware that if you type the command "/corpse", it will
tell you whether you have any corpses still in existence
somewhere in the zone (or not).  And if you're close enough
("fifty feet", the manual says) it'll even pull the corpse
from where it is to directly under your feet.  This can make
looting easier if your corpse is stuck up a tree or something.
It can also be used repeatedly ("/corpse", move, "/corpse', move,
etc.) to effectively "drag" your corpse anywhere in the zone.

This is useful if you need to get it out from under something
dangerous (and hopefully run with your corpse to a guard for
protection), or if you want to drag it to a high-level Cleric
for an experience resurrection (something that is a waste of time
at your level, it first becomes really necessary around level
30 or so).
