There is no inconsistency there.  Pro-life is protecting innocent
lives that have no voice and cannot defend themselves.  Capital
punishment is killing people who have committed crimes against the
society in question.  Totally different functions.

The definition of what is a child is a heated issue no doubt but the
function is the same.  Most people would not want to kill a 2 month
old baby, Christians just define a baby differently.

As to the debate of "all life is sacred", true to a point.  Christian
bible has the death penalty all over it and for far less crimes than
what we kill people for in today's society.  But all of them are due
to some crime against, in this case, God.  Society has the death
penalty for people who cannot live within it, so they take them out of
it.

There is no inconsistency.
