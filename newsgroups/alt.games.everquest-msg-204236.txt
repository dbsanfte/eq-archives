Hmm, I did it in the reverse order actually, I got my AA then I got the 
charm, the charm had stats when I got it, seemed about right for the 
number of flags I had.  I have not recieved any flags since then, so I 
don't know yet that it will automatically get better with a new flag, but 
I suspect that is the case.
