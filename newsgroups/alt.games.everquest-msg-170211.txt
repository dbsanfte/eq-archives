I used to spend alot of time in Stonebrunt.  Stonebrunt being the 
ass-end of nowhere, I was always by myself.  After talking for 3 days, I 
finally convince a friend to come join me.  Of course, he's never been 
through Paineel and doesn't listen when I say not to Autofollow.  As I 
swing past the Hole, he slides off and plonks right in the Hole and I 
say buh-bye to hopes of getting any xp that day.  Took us an hour to 
find a necro to summon his corpse.  I was at the point I wanted to give 
up and make a rogue to go in and get it for him.  If PoP had been around 
I would have made that rogue after the first 5 minutes, I didn't want to 
walk a newbie rogue all the way to Odus.
