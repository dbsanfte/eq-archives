Definitely third, shaman heals are substantially behind druids. In fact
further than I even thought, there's no shaman equivalent to Tunare's
renewal? Druids get a 4.5K heal and shaman's top out at 2K? Geeze that's
useless.

Who cares? In pop, where a level 65 is going to be fighting / raiding
300 points a tick is laughably inadequate. Torpor was uber fighting
slowed old world junk but it is so meaningless as a actual heal in pop.

No, they're the same they're just substantially weaker.

Only if you need junk buffs or the encounter actually needs it.
Otherwise you are just wasting everyones time and filling up buff
slots for no reason. Acumen? you must be kidding me. Bih'li? no way,
everyone wants FoE off the druid.

I think the idea was that "excess" shaman could be casting avatar
on people. But that's so definitively not fun that even shaman mind
it being a proc most uber-melee can manage themselves.

This is cripple again? The best parsing i've seen was incredibly
inconclusive. Some people believe the dex debuff helps reduce 
mob procs so it tends to get thrown on.

Spot healing is a valid role for a third shaman. While the druid heals
better, and the cleric a lot better, shaman do have good mana
regen and so can afford to deplete their mana reserves. It's not
particularly glorious but it is useful.
