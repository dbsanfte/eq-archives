Actually, I don't think he's looking for legal counsel so much as links to
articles on legal issues in MMOG's.  Probably for a research project.

Assuming that is the case, the original poster might want to spend some time
browsing the archives at http://terranova.blogs.com/

That is probably going to be your best source.

www.gamepolitics.com  might also have some past stories, but they have not
been around as long as Terra Nova, so it might not have come up there.
