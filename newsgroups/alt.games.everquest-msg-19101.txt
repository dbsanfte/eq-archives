    An excellent enchanter on my server, Zaldane, has his 11 year old son
take over when he needs to go AFK for some reason. He always warns his
group, and as soon as his son comes on he says "Hi, Jr here taking over for
dad." Amazing thing is, the kid is better than many regular players I know -
he doesn't do anything annoying, is personable but shy when talked to, and
as long as you help him a bit (I made a "Jr, the add is %t" hotkey to help
him out) he's a fine enchanter. Apparently he's even been on planes raids.
