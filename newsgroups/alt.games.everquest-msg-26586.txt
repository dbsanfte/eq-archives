Nah.  Evil is not actually a bigger team than the others.

Whoa, settle down now, let me rephrase that:

The Evils that aren't playing it like a blue server are not actually a 
bigger team than the Goods.  At least half the Evil population is just 
sitting on the sidelines laughing at the other players spending all their 
time fighting each other, not realizing that without pvp practice they will 
be like mewling kittens should they ever desire to venture from their safe 
havens.

Don't believe me?  See:

<http://everquest.station.sony.com/stats/sz_summary.jsp>

Overall standings as of 7/30:
Neutral Alliance 122,345 points
Evil Alliance 90,831 points
Good Alliance 60,226 points

Yesterday's standings (either 7/30 or 7/29, it's 10pm here at the moment so 
I can't tell)
Neutral Alliance 11,019 points
Evil Alliance 9,412 points
Good Alliance 3,182 points

In the Top 20 overall, there are 4 Evils, 7 Goods and 11 Neutrals.  In 
yesterday's Top 20, there are 9 Evils, 3 Goods and 8 Neutrals.

If Evil is supposed to be such an overpowerful alliance, why are they 
getting spanked just by the Neutral team, much less the Newts and the Goods 
combined?
