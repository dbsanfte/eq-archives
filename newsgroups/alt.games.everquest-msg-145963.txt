It's pretty obvious really. If there was no bias against soloing,
there's be nothing to balance against the problems grouping (finding a
group, finding a good group, etc).

If everyone soloed, a lot more would've quit years ago. The bias towards
grouping means people come into close contact a lot more, develop more
interpersonal relationships, and are more likely to continue playing the
game for longer.

It's part vision, part financial acumen
