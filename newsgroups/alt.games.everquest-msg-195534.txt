Why? For some people, KEI just keeps them below the level of tedium that 
they are willing to tolerate... And yes, *before* we didn't have KEI, 
but before was before, and now is now. After getting used to KEI, I 
simply cannot sit on my ass playing Gems and watching /guildchat scroll 
by for minutes at a time like I could before.

Honestly, I think that the best solution would be to raise the natural 
mana regeneration post-50 to KEI levels, and eliminate *all* standing 
mana regen buffs (druid and beastlord included). Cannibalizing mana 
regeneration spells (shaman, mage, necro) are quite class-defining, so I 
would leave them as-is, perhaps with a certain reduction in effectivity, 
to compensate for the higher natural regeneration.
