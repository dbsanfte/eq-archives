Jazz,

You're pet gains magical attack at level 12.

If you know a friendly mage, get some summoned daggers (magical) and hand
them to your below 12 pet.  Your pet now attacks as if a magic attack.
Also, any weapon at the early stages (except short swords, I think) will
help the pet do max damage.  The best are the 2h weapons, though.  Weapon
speed has no effect on teh speed of teh (now armed) pet attacks.  I'm not
positive of the timing, but I think that pets are in the 30 delay range,
always.
