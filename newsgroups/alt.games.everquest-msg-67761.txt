It's happened to me in probably a half dozen different zones, on both the
moon and Norrath.

My right mouse button just stops working.  One time, after about 10 minutes
(I was traveling and didn't actually need it for once) it started working
again, but I have no idea why.

Yes, I've /bugged it.  Actually I've done it on both of my accounts.

If I exit the game the button's working, so I KNOW it's not a hardware
issue.

Hmmmm....I didn't try downloading and installing the very latest version of
the mouseware software (Logitech), though a friend with XP, DX8.1 and the
latest mouseware says she has the same problem.  I'll probably still try it,
since I'm on 98SE but I'm not very optimistic.

Win98SE
Athlon 1200MHz (tbird, I'd guess...it's not the cheapie version)
512MB PC133
GF2MX400(64) video
integrated audio still

Happens on this computer, too...the EQ folder is a carbon copy of the
first...I didn't want to go thru the installation and patching again. :p

Win98SE
Athlon 700 tbird
512MB mixed PC100 & 133
GF2MX200(32)
SBLive

Both use Logitech mice, same software.
