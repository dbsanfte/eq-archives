You can all thank Verant now for really f**king things up for Alot of people
with jumping the gun to DX8.1 by force...

I wish you all luck in your ways of getting EQ to work correctly, as for me
I already quit EQ months before I stopped paying for it...

One thing I'd like to know is has anyone found anything else out there that
requires DX8.1 besides EQ to run properly? Strange thing is, is that 8.0a
and 8.1 are so similar but 8.1 handles D3D differently somewhat. Seems MS
tried to make it easier for it to recognize video boards by simplifying how
it scans the card's compatability for D3D. For an example look at 8.1 under
Display (start/run/dxdiag) but messed it up in the process. 8.0a is much
more stable. And luckily there is an alternative, OpenGL. Never figured out
why EQ didnt support it when it does support 3DFX cards which were the first
Glide cards (yes I know the differences between 3dfxglide & opengl)...
