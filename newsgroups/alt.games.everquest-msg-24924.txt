You've just described my guild, except we have a few players in their 50s.
I've seen  tons of people level up and switch guilds. We're cool about it,
its nice to have friends in big places. :) But the thing is, that's just how
its going to be with guilds like ours. There are people that want to be in
big powerful guilds, and there are people that like it less powerful, but
more friendly, family-like guilds. I know I've been invited to larger
guilds, but while being able to do plane raids whenever I want would be
nice, I'd miss the atmosphere of the smaller guild.

So, how do you solve your problem? Honestly, I dont think you do. The large
powerful "uber" guilds on my server seem to be almost militant, not very
family-like at all. But they do cool things, and thats enough for some
people. Eventually, you will get enough people that like the guild, who will
stick around when they get older. One thing that will definately help is
stating an alliance with similiar guilds, which is what we did. That way
there is a much larger pool of friends to group with, and each guild retains
the feel of a small guild. Setting up a working alliance can be a lot of
work, but its worth it I think. Our alliance seems to be falling apart a
little, which is upsetting, but all the guilds are still good friends. We
just dont do stuff with each other as much.

Hope that helps a little. :)

Joe
