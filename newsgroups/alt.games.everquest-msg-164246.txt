Hmm, while I would agree for clerics, the deities that can create paladins
seem to be, at least loosely, allied.  I can't see much contention between
Tunare, the Marr twins, Qellious, Prexus, Karana, Nife, and Brell.  They may
be petty gods in some sense, but I would think any of them would frown on
their knights killing holy men of the other dieties, if for nothing other
than "diplomatic complications."  Though Brell does fall somewhat outside
this, with some of his races.
