Speaking as a level 38 druid, I never ask for money for ports, I either tell
them I'm busy or that I'll port them and leave it up to them to pay.  (yes,
I do answer shouts for ports "paying 200pp" or whatever, if I feel like it)

Exceptions:
Iceclad - dangerous zone in, I hate getting jumped by ice dervs, they either
pay in advance or cast invis on me while I'm casting the port.
(in the future)
GD - over 50% of people go LD porting into here, I don't know why, so if
they were planning on paying, I want it before I have to sit at the circle
for a half hour for them to log back in.  (I had to sit at the ring to pay a
guy who ported a friend last week, ugh, should've left after 15 minutes)
WL - Until I get my CoV faction up, no ports into here at all for anyone
unless a friend of mine or guildmate can confirm that Woushi isn't up, and
payment in advance once faction is up (in case portee is KoS to Woushi).
CS - Granted, the spawns are probably all dead or dying, but until I get my
CoV up, this is also a no-port zone for me, and payment in advance otherwise
for same reason as WL.

Not sure about the danger level of the EJ/SF ports, but those look to be the
only others with any possible restrictions.

The worst port story I have is sitting in EC auctioning stuff and a level 13
necro asks for a port to BB, ok, I port him, then he pays me 10pp and asks
to wait a minute to port him back to WC, I wait about 30 minutes (yes,
stupid on my part) and some level 3 gnome shows up (who hadn't even been in
zone when I ported in), and from what I could tell bought a robe from the
necro, I port the necro back and run off before he asks for a sow.  I needed
to sell crap.  Should've just left the stupid bastard in BB surrounded by
KoS dorf guards.
