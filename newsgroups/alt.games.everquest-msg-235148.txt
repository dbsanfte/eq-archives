People *should* think about the names they choose.  A rose may be a rose, but
there have been people I *won't* group with because of their names.  You want
to make a political / racial / sexual statement?  Fine.  But I'm not sure I'd
do it with my character name. 
OTOH, I got a real kick out of Benwa, whose last name is Balls.  And he is a
darn good player.  *I* would not choose that name, but I'm thinking alot of
people don't even know what that is.  Or am I being naive?  (My BF had to
explain it to me).

I kind of wondered this too.  And after a few comments he may have realized he
was doing something *stupid*.
I have only logged my BFs wizard on a couple of times to port people I was
playing with.  I wouldn't dream of trying to *play* him.  (I play casters but
wiz spell icons look totally different than mine, even porting makes me
paranoid).
