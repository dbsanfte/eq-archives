   And the world is black and white.  If someone disagrees with you, it's
not because they really did have a different experience than you did, it is
because one of you is a wrong, moron liar.

   Usenet can be fun.  However, it is a place to promotes discussion and
disagreements.  If you can't handle someone not agreeing with you 100%,
then perhaps usenet will be very frustrating for you.

And, please don't top post.  This is a bottom posting newsgroup.  Thanks.
