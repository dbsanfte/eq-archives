If he gave all his stuff away, he's probably far from the max on INT and
mana pool. Root rotting those HG's solo, I think, is going to be a
pretty tricky operation at best at level 40. They have a mountain of HP
to rot away, and one failed root/snare could lead to the HG getting in
mellee range of the wizard. After that...... just hope you can channel
through gate on the first shot.
