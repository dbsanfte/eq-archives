Well, I tried to come back to EQ. I bought the new Luclin pack (which
does look awesome BTW), but I just can't do it. Dark Age of Camelot
has its hooks in me and won't let go. All the things I hate about EQ
are fixed in Camelot. Things like:

Having to pay for EVERYTHING in EQ. I have to pay for a teleport,
bind, spells, etc. All that stuff and more is free and automatic in
Camelot.

I absolutely HATE having to do corpse runs. In Camelot, if I die all I
lose is the exp which I can gain some back by praying at my grave. I
don't have to though. I respawn with all my gear and cash. That is
awesome.

Lots of folks don't like how much more quiet Camelot is referring to
chatting. I actually prefer Camelot. I know I can turn auctions off in
EQ and OOC stuff, but it's just not an issue in Camelot.

There's a MUCH better underlying story in Camelot than in EQ. It is a
blast doing the quests and finding little snips of the story here and
there. I also don't have to wait all day (literally) for a monster to
respawn and MAYBE he'll drop the item I need. Respawns are much faster
in Camelot and they will drop the loot you need.


There are other things, but that gives the basic idea. EQ may look
better in some instances (the atmosphere in EQ is better with Luclin,
but I much prefer the monsters in Camelot), but for gameplay it's
Camelot hands down. Please hold the flames to a minimum, this is not a
troll thing, just stating an opinion. YMMV.
