Offsides rule in both soccer and hockey is to promote skill and not allow
camping or cherry picking.  Both soccer and hockey have much better and
clearer rules than our football.  Last few years, rules interpretations have
helped determine playoff outcomes.  That isn't to say any of the sports are
bad.  I even write articles on fantasy football.  Our football won't catch
on anywhere else as there's no flow.  People don't understand why it takes
30+ seconds between every play.  Rugby is more popular in the world than our
football.  American football has rules similar to these offsides calls.
Take your pick: offsides, encroachment.  There's a lot worse:  illegal
formation, player didn't report in, 2 men moving forward at same time before
hikes, uncovered lineman.  Try explaining why a qb can't just pass to a
lineman.  But if a qb throws to the rb who tips it to the lineman, that's
allowed.   Most important is illegal forward motion.  Why do you think arena
football scores so many points?  Heh, isn't the whole game to move forward?
