I used to have this problem.  Sometimes I still have it. :-)  The key 
for me was two fold. First, keep trying different race/class combos 
till you get one that you just LIKE playing.  Don't be swayed by 
people who tell you what's easier to solo or what levels fastest, or 
what's the most powerful, etc etc.  There are so many different 
combinations to make one will eventually grow on you or maybe EQ isn't 
your game.

Second, make friends.  You don't need twenty.  One or two people that 
you can fight with or sometimes even just chat with during your more 
boring sessions.  If can't seem to hook up with the same person twice, 
try joing a guild.  Shop around on those though.

It sounds to me like you either really are not cut out to be a lone 
soloer or that repitition gets to you.  But you've tried bard which is 
a thinking class and didn't enjoy explaining things.  So I'm guessing 
its the solo life getting you down.  Start a cleric.  I'd say try 
enchanter but you'll run into much of the same kind of thing you got 
with the bard.

Good luck.
