An Alchemist isn't some special kind of shaman. It just emans you have brought up
your alchemy skill (like any other normal trading skill) to 46 (if I remember right),
so SoW potions get trivial (doesn't mean 100% success btw). You won't do that
with your low level, as you can start Alchemy at level 25, and it has a skill cap
of (<Your level> - 24) * 5. So, at level 25, you can only advance it to 5. I started
alchemy at level 50, basically because I could raise it high enough to be happy by
then and because alchemy is expensive. The herbs to make 1 SoW potion cost about
6-7 pp. And you will fail mostly in the beginning, so plan on having hundreds of
pp to train, even at level 50.
