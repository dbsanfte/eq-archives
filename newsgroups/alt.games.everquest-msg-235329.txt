Of course, if somebody plays on the Lanys server and runs across a
real idiot/scumbag/rip-off artist, they can post that player's name to
the Lanys "Shit List"

http://pub130.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver

And they do have rules about posting:  You have to register to post on
the boards, you can't post anonymously (you have to use the name of
your in-game character) and you must name the specific shit-listed
player, not just their guild or whatever.  I also think they won't
allow hearsay posts (like "my friend told me today that last night
So-and-So kept KSing him all night", the friend would have to be the
one posting), and the moderators will lock and remove posts that they
don't think warrant being on the list.
