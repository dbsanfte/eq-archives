  I'm not sure what your budget is like at this point, but you may be
able to afford a few pretty good weapons if you keep your eye out for
them.  Most of them you probably can't obtain quite yet alone, though
you might be able to try in a couple levels with a solid group behind
you.

  A good 2H weapon for you at this point would be a blackened alloy
bastard sword.  24/39.  They are a not-entirely-rare drop off some of
the tougher mobs in Runnyeye Citadel.  On my server, it's about the
best 2H weapon you can get before level 35, on a non-twink sub-level
35 budget.  They can sell for anywhere between 100-300 platinum (in my
experience, closer to 100.)

  A good 1H weapon would be a Netherbian Unguis.  8/25 with a couple
stat boosts.  Uses piercing skill.  These drop fairly often on Luclin
in the Netherbian Lair.  On my server these usually sell for around
50pp.

  Another good one is the sturdy grimling miner's pick.  12/29.  Only
bad thing about it is that it isn't magic.  They drop pretty commonly
in the Tenebrous Mountains in the grimling mines.  You won't be able
to kill the mobs that carry them yourself, but you might be able to
convince someone hunting there to sell you one at a good price.
They're for a quest, but the quest reward isn't that great, it's for a
2HS mining pick that really isn't even as good as a blackened alloy
bastard sword.

  Good luck.
