Well, in my experience Lull used to fail 3/4ths the time, and when it failed,
would aggro the target and everthing nearby 3/4ths the time.

I used to complain about this at length, since it was so utterly useless,
especially compared to Harmony.  Harmony worked 90% of the time and never ever
aggroed on failure.

I was cool with it being single target instead of multiple, but the failure rate
being so high and the aggro rate being so high meant that you'd only try it for a
joke, or in situations where a split was absolutely crucial and there was a zone
line nearby, so you could try it again and again till you made it work... even
here, it would only work on very tiny camps, since to split 2 you'd have a 50%
chance of pulling both, but with 3 you'd have to cast twice, so now you'd have a
50% chance of pulling all three and a 50% chance of getting two; 75% chance of not
single pulling.  More mobs in the camp the worse it got.

If it worked 3/4ths the time, or aggroed 1/4th the time, it would be worth trying;
not as good as Harmony, but a lesser version of the same thing.

What they did was change it so -both- are true, or better than that; with a
reasonable charisma, it fails even more rarely than that, and aggro on failure is
even rarer.

Since it works indoors and out, it becomes a very useable tool.

At the same time, Harmony was nerfed down to a single target spell, at least at
higher levels, and yet works only outdoors still.  Since its casting cost is
significantly lower than that of high level lull line spells, its still used there
a lot more than the lull spells, but being able to use lull line indoors has lead
to a revolution in some indoor camps, sending forward a cleric, paladin,
enchanter, or bard to create a single pullable situation to break camps is now a
viable option.

The addition of POP then created a bunch of "outdoor" zones with high level and
raid level targets where the use of harmony again is preferred (ranger spending
very little mana, and frankly ranger mana isn't all that important to a raid
anyway, versus a cleric or enchanter spending a LOT of mana per mob, well you
figure out who gets the job)

Really I haven't used this all that often, other than while playing with it to see
what was possible.  My greatest triumph was using it to get in to the Arena area
in Kael Drakkar; there are a foursome of "see invisible" guards at the entrance to
the arena, and in low level raids, latecomers often end up getting to that point
and then dying, having their body dragged and rezed.  I can use invis to get to
that point, then Pacify all four and walk right in past them.

Of course I can also just kill all four using Pacify to single pull them, or I can
(and usually do) just run past them and train the raid, which can nowadays easily
handly 4 giants at a time.  Or we use someone grouped with a mage and bound
outside, or use (decession?) to port someone to the zone line, and COTH them in.
But it was fun to see that I -could- get thru on my own.
