I was wondering about how the economy of the different servers varies. Since
I started playing Everquest, I've been playing on that new server Maellin
Starpyre (sp?). Everything I read on the web that talks about prices of
things in the game is skewed drastically from what I see in my game.

I'm a level 14 barbarian beastlord and I've mostly played around Everfrost
Peaks and Black Burrow with a little time in Crushbone. Most of the decent
loot I've found has sold for 1 or 2 gold, with the best selling for about 6
gold. Everything I read online talks about everything selling for platinum.
Is this difference because the server is still somewhat new and the economy
needs to develop or is there something I'm missing?
