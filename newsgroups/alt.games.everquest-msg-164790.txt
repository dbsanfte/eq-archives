It is unfair to whites.  No matter how much a "rich" white male may have, he
still deserves a chance to compete in the open marketplace, on the basis of
what he can bring to a potential employer.  His wealth should not bar his
enterence into that arena.

And, even worse, Affirmative Action is unfair to poor whites.  Not only are
we the "downtrodden," but we're also being discriminated against.  Granted,
we're white, so Jessie Jackson and his clowns have no problem with
discriminating against us.
