You have all forgotten...how could you?

Everyone knows they want 5 minutes alone with HGs, Specs, SGs, and one
special fellow The gnome in Crush Bone!! I forgot his name (heh sorry...) he
has a few pets hes in the slaver pits nearest the castle, in a hole or
something...if he has ever attacked you  or gotten out everyone wants a part
of him...
