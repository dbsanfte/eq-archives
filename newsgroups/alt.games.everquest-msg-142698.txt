Stacking issues aside, I'm trying to remember the last time a cleric meleed
and anybody cared about the damage output.  Oh, yeah, I think it was in N
Ro, at level 10.

The atk buff is useless.  The mana regen is pitiful, and doesn't stack with
BAOR.  BAOR mana regen is almost 3 times as good.  There's the Dex buff too,
don't forget that one.  :b

For a cost of 25 mana, you get 4 ticks of 10 mana per tick regen.  For an
ATK/DEX buff, self only.  And less mana regen than BAOR.

So, what situation exactly is it that you forsee using this spell in?
