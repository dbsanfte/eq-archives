Was in a group the other day and my 1 year old daughter was on the bed
playing with her feet or bellybutton or something entertaining like that.  I
turned the sound up to get her attention and she crawled over and went nuts
looking at all the pretty spells and activity on the screen.  She was
pointing at everything saying something intelligent like "Bah".

Now when she sees the monitor on or off, she immediately bolts for it
looking for the pretty colors.  I guess she will no doubt play a caster in a
few years (better start saving my plat now).
