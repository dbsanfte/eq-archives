'if all goes smoothly'.. I expect myself to have a 3 hour patch followed by
a congested server followed by said server falling over, another 3 hour wait
for it to get back up and running. I also expect tech support to be closed
and lots of screaming people.  Aye, should fun, looking forward to it.

On a non- cynical note, I am actually really looking forward to the new UI,
I haven't loaded test to look at it, but the screenshots look nice, so
hopefully it'll be helpful.
