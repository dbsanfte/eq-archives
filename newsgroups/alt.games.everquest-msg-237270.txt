Ruined EQ? Hardly. You're barely represented in EQ. Particularly on
the Blue servers where this druid is playing.

Stupid? maybe :) ... as others have noted you've basically excluded

That's not doing yourself or them any favours.

But why he'd feel the need to harass you about it is completely beyond
me. You only hurt yourself. Maybe he just wanted to help... but it
doesn't sound like he was being helpful.

Not yet. It might be yet. As you find yourself unwelcome in groups as
you can't be healed or buffed or ported... you may come to regret this
choice. Hope you like soloing.

Upset? Not usually. But they do usually strongly discourage it for
your own good. If you simply must pvp i suggest dueling or playing on
a pvp server. Both support pvp combat better.
