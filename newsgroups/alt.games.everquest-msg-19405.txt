My gnome wizard has almost reached level 9. At level 8 I only had enough money
to buy some of the spells. Two of the ones I didn't get were Column of Frost and
Finger's of Fire. Are they worth buying? Are area effect spells and personal
area spells worth having since they seem to do less than the same level DD.

I didn't buy Shadow Step either. Does the difference between this and Fade make
worth buying?

Thanks in advance. :)
