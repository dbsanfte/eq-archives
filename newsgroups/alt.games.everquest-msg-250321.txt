Flags/keys are the reward you get for doing certain quests or raids.
They grant you access to areas or zones that you can't otherwise
enter.

Keys are mostly used pre-Planes of Power.  For example to enter
Vex Thal you must collect a series of ten items from various zones
across Luclin and combine them into one, which acts as a key to
allow you into Vex Thal.  Generally, after you've used a key once,
you'll get a message that this key has been added to your character's
"keyring" and you can safely discard the actual key item.  (Not all
keys are like this, though, so be careful.)

Flags are mostly used in the Planes of Power and later expansions.
They are the same general concept as keys, but there are no actual
items to collect.  Flags are generally granted by talking to an
NPC who gives you a quest, killing the boss monster for that quest
(such as Grummus in poDisease), hailing the Planar Projection which
spawns after the boss is dead, then returning to the NPC.
