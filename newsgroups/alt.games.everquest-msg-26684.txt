I've long considered that part of my "job description" as the tank in the
group. We've gotten trained by multiple giants, in situations where it
was obviously impossible for us to prevail. I'm generally sow'd, but I
end up calling the evac for the casters to gate and anyone else to run,
and I just stand there and taunt and keep swinging till everyone's on
their way to safety.  Of course, by then I've taken so much damage that
even SoW wont' let me outrun them, so I just stay there and die. The
important thing is to get the cleric out alive so she can sneak back in
and rez me. Yeah, at this point I only get 1/2 my xp back, but that's ok.
I can make it up. In fact, I've given up changing my bind point when
hunting. We've been hunting in several old world zones for the last
couple weeks and I'm still bound in Thurgadin!  No worries. As long as
the cleric is there, I *know* I've got a ride back.  And even if the
cleric bites it also, she's never bound far away.
