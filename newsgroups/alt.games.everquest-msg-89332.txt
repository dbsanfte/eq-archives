 I have already finished the Shackle of Tynnonium. I'm casually working
on the WF quest but as I already have my epic and weapons with better
stats I probably wont finish it since at one point the shackle is eaten.

 Personally I see the RotLC and RotWF as easier if you have a group of
friends that don't mind doing the Karnors and Chardok camp with you.
Everything else can be done solo. Whistling Fists are a little harder
since there at least two mobs you can't do solo (although they are
triggered mobs so no waiting for Pawbuster or Betrayer) plus you have to
make two forays into Fear to speak with Cazic Thule.

 Regardless, I think the days of Brother Zephyl and Qwinn dropping the
robes are numbered. They've already made it a rare drop (or so I
understand). With two paths to the epic I don't see a need for the robe
to drop at all anymore.
