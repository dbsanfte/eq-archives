Not too shabby at all. 

Gear and Buffs are on the same field here. There isn't any difference
when Loser A looks at you and tells you, get Temp plz, or Loser B
looks at you and tells you, get EP lewtz plz. Both of them, losers,
regardless.

I've tanked many times without Temp, and yep, I too have been told to
get Temp or why didn't I get Temp and all of that bull$hit. Sure, the
healer might have to start healing me up a little earlier than a tank
with Temp but it'll all balance out since it'll take the healer
proportionally more mana to heal me up with the extra 900 or so HPs
from the buff.

Honestly, Temp is more like a safeguard for a group screwup than it is
a necessity to tank. When I look at my group and see that they have a
chance to win but they also have a chance to be incompetant, I'll
probably grab a Temp if I see one available.

Happens with spoiled players. Its like that retarded show, the Simple
Life. Here we have 2 imbeciles suddenly being thrust into a situation
where they can't have anything they want (sorta) nor have the luxuries
they were accustomed to having. Yeah you see them whine and complain
and pout, as scripted prolly, but heck at least they make the effort
to make do unlike some kids in this game.
