I've got an adsl router and if I can figure out how to bridge it, I'll use a
pppoe connection so that i can traceroute. The problem seems to be outside
everquest as I noticed there's packet loss at the time pinging other sites
and I suspect it's to do with the phone line or (ouch) the router, which is
of course out of warranty, and have thrown myself unto the tender mercies of
my ISP, and am holding because they have let me know that my call is
important to them.

Time before they look at the case = 6 business days! Aieeee! I'm going
through EQ withdrawal.
