Ah, you are missing the utility of this hotkey

start from scratch, first cast.  the hotkey gets to /cast 5 (stun)
and starts the spell.  It continues on, hits the other two lines
and in both cases give me a "you can't cast this spell" message
because I'm still casting the first spell

Second my spell markers come back up I hit it again.  It gets
to /cast 5, but that spell is still blacked out.  It complains
that I can't cast that spell, reads the next line, and starts
/cast 6 (holy might), then complains again about the last line

Spells up again, I repeat.  Skips the first two, which
are both blacked out, and instead /cast 7 (force) begins

Next time I hit it, stun is back up.

Next time holy might

Next time (because these things get a little weird) stun is often
up again

Force

Stun

Holy Might

Stun

So on and so forth

I only have to lean on one key, and I always cast the cheapest
quickest stun I have available.

Further, if I fizzle one, I also tend to still get a cast started,
although one of the higher level ones.

I'm sure its possible to handle overlap better, I'm doubtless
wasting a little mana by always casting the lowest level stun
available just after I cycle back... in fact I've been known
to CHAIN CHAIN CHAIN and then target someone for
a quick GHeal or fear an add before returning to the chain,
taking advantage of that longer pause on Force.

Putting delays in would mean giving up character control for
the run of all three stuns, and committing to actually casting
them (D might break me out of the casts but would still stick
me with the delays, wouldn't it?)
