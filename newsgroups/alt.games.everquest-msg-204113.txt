Grrr, you people, assuming that just because a ranger does something
_different_ that it's because she doesn't know any better. ;)

*grin* Actually...I already have my Swiftwind.  I had no compunctions
about putting it aside (except simply the amount of time that went into
it), and something I read on the Glade enforced it even more.  A parse of
a level 60 ranger:

swifty and tox (my previous combo, conveniently)
vs.
31/28 2hs and 16% haste

Not only did the 2hs have slightly higher DPS, but damage from ripostes
was much lower (and DSs I'd imagine).   When I can get my hands on a new
main-hand 1-hander I'll do some parses of my own, but not until I get my
2hb from 201 to max.  The only place I might miss the swifty haste is with
archery, but doesn't matter to me much yet. By that time I'll have a
better haste item.

So, in my case...yeah, I justify it. ;)  I currently have a 37/36 2hb, and
my goal is a 41/31 2hb which I should be able to achieve sometime within
the year.

segue: thanks James for the info about PAL/SKs...that is what I wanted to
know.  These days when I ask folks they rarely answer that question, just
say..."you're a ranger, why do you care?" /sigh

As far as the EQ/AM3 discussion is concerned...all I can say is one
thing.  You are right.  It is the best AA a ranger can spend. 

*helpless shrug and smile*

It's an informed decision, believe me.  Not a _logical_ one, but
informed at the very least. 

I'm very good at changing my PoV, though, so who knows.  If my husband
gets torpor before I spend my AA points, I just might do archery AA's, so
we can do the "shaman tanks, ranger plinks" tactic.

Incidentally, after 48hrs of straight camping (server reset in there)
stormfeather popped this morning while I was holding camp for my sleeping
husband (he stayed up all night for it).  So now he's holding camp for me
until I can get home, and hopefully in another ungodly number of hours
I'll have mine too.  Taking vacation tomorrow...cross fingers for me ya'll
that no stinker shows up to try to KS me!
