Ok has anyone figured out how to chat and use the arrow keys to still drive? 
(this is the same problem I had with CoH, but dont have with DAOC or EQ1)
Also anyone figured out how to have things other than /gu or /tell appear in 
the chat history? Those are the only two items that seem to exist in my chat 
history.

Lastly - having fun with the game, not much lag for me, and I like the 
quests.................
