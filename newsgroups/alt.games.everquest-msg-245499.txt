Essentially, the whole problem could ahve been avoided with if,
instead of nerfing monk mitigation, they had just removed the inate AC
bonuses they got compared to everyone else. Itemization would still
have been a problem for a while (given the all/all items at the time)
but that would have taken care of itself in the later expansions.
