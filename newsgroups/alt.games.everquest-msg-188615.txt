Prefer Diet Coke over normal <shrug>
One summer, at a share house, we ran out of Coke so were left drinking the
Diet stuff..have preferred it to normal ever since. Can't say that is the
same for Cola's tho'
I'm surprised your dentist advised you to switch to Diet over normal...I was
under the impression that diet drinks were even worse for your teeth than
normal, sugar filled, ones.

And no, I am not fat....pretty far from it.
