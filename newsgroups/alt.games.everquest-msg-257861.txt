Why are the melees assumed to be "loot whores"?  What stops the cleric from
getting the expense for the reagents after some loot has actually been
collected?

I know the answers, every one you can come up with, and it all comes down to
people and their personalities.  Learn to deal with that and you don't have
to deal with all the other crap that results from *not* dealing with the
personalities (theirs and yours) to begin with.

If I'm paying ahead of time, we're right back with me in PoK getting a fully
extended Temp.  =P
