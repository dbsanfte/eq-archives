    That isn't always true. Not all guilds have a tracking mule parked in
every zone of interest to them, which can be logged on by any random person
that's online. There are guilds that will race another guild any time they
see that other guild gathering, on principle alone (ie. they're griefing the
guild). Also, if a given guild is /anon then it becomes much tougher to
establish exact times of death on mobs - you can't see them leave the zone
directly, and how often do you leave a tracker logged on to do this? So the
/anon guild has a distinct advantage getting the next spawn of that mob,
too.

    At least, those are all the reasons the local /anon guild has given us.
