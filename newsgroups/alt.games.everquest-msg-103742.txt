I've spent some time in LoIO, and it usually gets turned off in that zone.
I needed that Jade Chokidai Prod for my key.  Then after giving my prod
away, I realized that I would really like to have one, so I went and got one
to use in combat.  Then, being greedy, I sold it, so now I need to go back
to LoIO again and get another.
