How many SciFi/Fantasy style books you got lying around your house? I got
some names from one of my favorites.  Seen a few from other books and
fantasy comics ( no, not those kind of fantasies.....! LOL)  Some names I
have gotten from the EQ generator but I usually use that as a jumping off
point, usually add or subtract from the generated name.  My main name is a
12c Gaelic name researched for the SCA, a medieval recreation type group.
You could try researching in one of those types of books, lots of odd Gaelic
names out there.
