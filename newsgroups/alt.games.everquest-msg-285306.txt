Has there ever been any serious discussion about upgrading the EQ1
interface to more resemble the EQ2 interface? i am playing the simple
demo with my pre-existing account now. Its nice but i'm not all that
crazy about the old style quest system. Ever since playing WoW and EQ2
i have gotten used to the functionality of that style of finding and
completing quests. I remember years ago trying to pick up quests,
typing in the bracketed word and not having it work because you also
had to figure out on your own a complete sentence to put that word
into. Not too cool.
