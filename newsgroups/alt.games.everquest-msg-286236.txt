I think that new links were posted further down in that discussion.
I am not certain about this.

Crescent Reach is the new low level area and its more likely to find
low level toons there. The old cities are dead, as are many of the
old zones. If I go to Kelethin, and see 2 other players, its
crowded.

I have seen claims the Crafting skillups are faster in Crescent
Reach than in Abysmal Sea. 15-20 minutes instead of an hour to reach
skill level 54. I haven't actually trired that.

The quest gear you can get in Crescent Reach and Blightfire Moors is
better than many older zone gear.

There is mention on the official forums, I forget the server name,
where they have started a guild for returning/new players who want
to go up in levels, etc.

Ah, here it is: New and Returning players come to Druzzil Ro/Xev.
It is in the Newbie Zone forum.
