>I would just like to point out that Sgt. Slate is a SERIOUS undercon. 

Most "Named" mobs at those levels are suicide for a melee class.
Especially guards. A Root/DoT class (Shaman/Druid), can solo him
pretty easily. My Druid at 43 could take down Slate. It took forever
though. I think I went through at least 3 of the 10min snares. At 49
with ES arms it is a piece of cake.

Someday I will try Charm and sick him on a Griffon when my Bard levels
up some more :-)

Cheers
