Maybe if you were capable of communicating, your request would have been a 
bit more clear.  Don't blame your incompetence on others.  You make a 
reference to "pussy cat."  I state that you're using the term incorrectly. 
You ask for a cite.  Gee, what am I supposed to conclude you're wanting 
cited?

It's a hell of a long jump, in the definitions in question, because they're 
not the same thing.  Go figure.

You've been hit upside the head with the truth time after time and still 
can't tell.  I'm really starting to question my assumption of "nobody can be 
that dumb."

I'd buy your denial alot more easily if you could argue without the use of 
strawmen.

And now you bow to yourself?  Stupidity -and- delusions of grandure all in 
one?  You really are something.

The reason you see poo on everone's face is that it's in your eyes.  Wipe 
your own, and you'll see that the rest of us are suddenly clean.  You've 
said what you are stupid enough to believe and you've liked dictionary 
definitions that do not support your arguement, but somehow you believe they 
do.
