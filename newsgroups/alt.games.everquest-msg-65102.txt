It seems to me that perhaps, if it is reasonable for you to do so, you might
just consider a whole new puter hon...  Rather than put more into a very
outdated machine, a new one that can handle whatever you wanna throw at it
is fairly reasonable...  especially if you don't need to add a monitor and
speakers because you can keep your current...


I don't know what else to suggest.  I think you may end up putting a bunch
of money into your current machine only to be disappointed...

Hang in there...
