Well my personal belief is that EVERY combo can be good.  Hell, some
of the most effective casters i have met, post 40 with my druid, are
<gasp> human!

I have met some great troll Shammies but it seems that they are the
best soloing shammy as opposed to grouping shammy.  I could easily be
wrong, but this has been my(albeit limited) experience.

For what its worth...i think you can make it work as long as you want
it to.  Remember...there are level 60 paladins!  LOL anythings
possible!

who heartily apologizes to all the pallies he offended
