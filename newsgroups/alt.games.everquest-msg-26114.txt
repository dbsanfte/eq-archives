Well, on the weekend I had the chance to install some recently purchased
toys in my system and the results EQ-wise were awesome.

I previously had an AOpen AX59Pro socket 7 board with a AMD K6.2 500mhz
processor in it. Last week I picked up 768mb of memory in 3 dimm's and only
noticed marginal performance increases when they were installed (had 128mb
prev).

I had used EQ on numerous loads of W2K and Win98 vanilla in this hardware
configuration and always suffered major disconnection problems on zoning.
The ingame screen resolution set to 800*600 but kunark was unusable (even
with clipping set to "where are my toes?") and the general feel ingame was
always "spongey and unresponsive". This I thought was just the nature of EQ.
Graphics card was a GF2 MX 32mb, but limited to AGP 2x by the older
motherboard.

The new components were an Asus A7133-C Socket 462 board with an Athlon
Thunderbird 1200Mhz with the same 768mb of pc133 memory and GF2 MX 32mb
graphics from the old system. Operating systems were dual boot clean
installs of 98 vanilla and W2K. Sound under W2K is not an issue as the sound
card is only a SB128.

Power supply was already a 300watt'er so no problems there. The "beast" of a
fan unit I had previously (6600rpm..sounded like a mig29 taking off) had
bonded to the old cpu via what seemed to be dodgy heat sink compound...(or
is it meant to set like superglue?) so was replaced with a 4200rpm
Thermoengine which is as quiet as a church mouse...blessedly. I consider the
old board and cpu to be toast though - as I could not lift the lever to
remove the cpu. The fan was still stuck on top and it had to be
forced...ech!

In 2 days of 4hour sessions of EQ under the "new" sysem there was not a
single disconnect on zoning and the responsivness was lightning fast in all
menus. I upped the screen resolution to 1024 by 768, set clipping to "other
side of West Karana" and loaded up Kunark. I could not notice a discernable
frame rate, whereas previously it would have been a slide show. I went to EC
tunnel during peak time  and it did not miss a beat. I turned on Seti@home
in the background and reloaded EQ and it still did not miss a beat...*evil
grin*

The game seemed to play better under W2K than 98, but that is a pretty
relative call.

To sum up - if you have been putting off upgrading by thinking EQ is old
software, so you can get away with old hardware, then it may be time to
reconsider. The difference ingame is very marked - and hardware prices are
very good at the moment....=P
