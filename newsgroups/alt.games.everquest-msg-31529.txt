Here is my thought.  And I am a member of a group which still has and
enforces the "Un-natural Acts" laws(USDOD UCMJ)  Anyhow.  How would I
find out if my best friend had oral sex with his wife?? unless (a)they
told me, or (b)I saw them.  Case a,  Hearsay, not admissable in a court
of law.  Case b, in most cases, either I would be breaking a law by
seeing(invasion of privacy) or I would be obligated to report it because
quite frankly I don't want to see that(public or semi-public place).  

If they placed me in a position where I was a witness vs me placing
myself in a position to witness such acts or me having hearsay
evidence.  Then they wouldn't be my friends long anyway.  However, The
question is not, is it appropriate for me to report or not to report,
but... Is it appropriate for a third party to castigate me for reporting
something that is within my rights to report.
