Chuck, I'm new here so I don't know if you're looking for a rise or  a
serious answer so I'll give you *MY* serious answer:

I wouldn't bother playing this game again unless you can accept the
fact that you'll never be the best or even close to the best unless you
devote unhealthy amounts of time / real life money back into the game.
You'll be behind if you are competitive at all. You'll have crappier
gear and you'll encounter the same frustrations that made you leave the
game in the first place. So unless you are happy being in a mediocre
guild mastering your tradeskills I'd wait for World of Warcraft.
