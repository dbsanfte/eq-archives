Just make sure you leave several of the carcasses out where we can get to
them.  We can make the "nerf KEI" pile in one corner, the "verant hates my
class" pile in another, and so on and so forth.  Considering how Verant
wants to make things constantly easier and more streamlined for the
players, they should probably provide us with bamboo poles as well.  I
mean...downtime between beating dead horses is just WRONG.
