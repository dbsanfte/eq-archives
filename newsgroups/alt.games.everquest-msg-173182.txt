Her own emeralds, thankyou :p Soft fur padding isn't my first esoteric
skillup, I got a few points towards 150 making lines for the potc
fishing pole.
When I get my new computer, I'll probably set out to farm some
acrylia, as I don't really have ennough to set out to skill up yet.
And after that, I guess my main route will be tigeraptor hide with
some wyvern (bought cheap, 5-10 pp each) and black panther and a
couple cobalt drake. Tigeraptor farming is almost fun :)
