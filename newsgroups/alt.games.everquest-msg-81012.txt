The speed thing is definitely a myth. Seems to be a constant speed
whether it's a rusty dagger or a halbred. Damage on the other hand.....
I've never given a crappy weapon to my pet and had the damage seem to go
*down*. But on the other hand, you can see what the level 12 pet's
normal damage is easily. When I gave it a Halbred, it went up. But I
suppose it's possible that I suddenly just started getting "lucky rolls"
for the pet for the rest of the session. But somehow it seems unlikely.
Of course, I haven't been able to test that in a while. The pet I have
now does more damage than any rusty weapons I hand it, so if I give them
any it's only for looks, and so they won't have that gimpy walk
animation. 

Anyone else notice this? If good old Jabobber is carrying a sword, he
stalks along in a rather menacing manner. Unarmed, he walks with this
sort of sideways, lame, "rainman" kind of gait.
