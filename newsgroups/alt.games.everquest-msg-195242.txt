    Halfling starting stats are still very good. Ask a ranger like Dennis
what he thinks of Halfling stats versus all other ranger races. Throwing in
other perks, like Infravision, racial hide, racial sneak, and a 5% XP bonus,
is really over-the-top.

    And two others have seen it. Let me reverse the question: can you show a
cite from a Verant/SOE source that humans were ever intended to get an XP
bonus? If you do a bit of poking around you'll find it's all based on one
line from one of the Prima guides that said that humans aren't exceptional
at anything, but they tend to level faster. And we all know how accurate
those Prima guides were....

    Given how few raw numbers/formulas were handed out in the beginning, I
doubt there was any intent to tell folks about an XP bonus. It would have
been more a way to help these "weaker" classes/races keep up in levelling
with the "stronger" race/class combinations.

    By the way, poking around in Google trying to find the quote sure turned
up some interesting stuff. Like Kendrick saying that the bard XP penalty was
justified and fine as-was!
