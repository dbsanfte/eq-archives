What you need to remember is that what you set your desktop to is what you 
get with everquest.  Say you run your desktop at 800x600, 16bit color, and 
at 85hz refresh rate.. If you play EQ at that same resolution, you will 
get the same refresh rate.  Say you run your desktop at 32 bit color and 
you set the refresh to 85, but do not change the 16 bit color depth to 
85hz, you will get some flicker or the default setting in EQ?  Hope that 
makes sense., 

I'll give you an example.  I play Age of Empire 2.  I run my desktop at 
1280, 32bit color, and 85mhz refresh rate.  However, Age of Empire runs 
the game at 256 colors and I usually do not run 256 colors on my desktop.  
therefore, when I go into the Age of Empire game, it will flicker because 
it's set to the default rate for 256 colors, usually 60hz.  So what you 
need to do is go through all the resolutions you want to run and toggle 
through each of the color depths and make sure you set them.  That should 
fix your problem.
