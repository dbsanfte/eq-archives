I got a bit tired of hunting round velious, so Im after a decent XP rate
place for a solo ranger which I guess means animal fear kiting with the
possiblity of getting groups for other stuff. 

Looked at EJ and its too out of the way for me (no PoP), and also very
laggy - though being able to group in CoM was fun.
DL got a bit too much for a number of reasons and Ive just come back from
Kunark.
DSP is really really a) boring and b) falling off in rate solo and at the
wrong time pick up groups can be hazardous to your health...

Im currently stuck in Qeynos Hills trying to make up my mind where to
go....any polite ideas on where to go, or is the EW grind really my best
option??
