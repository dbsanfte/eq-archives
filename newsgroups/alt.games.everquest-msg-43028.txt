Nope

What card do you have?
Have you configured your driver (texture memory, etc.)
What system BIOS?
What CPU?
Is your video BIOS updated?
Are your sound drivers (yes, this really is an issue) up to date?
Is your DirectX up to date? (always update it, even if you already have that
version, after you update video and/or sound drivers)
Is your hard drive fragmented?
How much RAM/virtual memory do you have?
Did you pray to Cazic-Thule this morning? (:P)
Did you pray to Loki (Norse god of mischief and, in modern days, technology)
last night? (:P)
