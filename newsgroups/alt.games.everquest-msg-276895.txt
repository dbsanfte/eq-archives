: Merging Servers

Wow, this is pretty huge. I wasn't expecting anything this widespread so
soon. Also, I'm shocked by the 2->1 ratio, I would think 3->2 or so
would give a healthier ratio, but then I guess that would put them in
danger of needing further server merges sooner (anyone want to start
another pool on that?). Sure, our population is down and could use a
boost, but doubling it will cause overcrowding in certain exp zones
(that are almost at capacity right now), and definitely in raid targets.
It will be interesting to see how it pans out.

Which brings me to the drama. My server is "lucky" enough to be keeping
its name. We are merging with another server of similar size (I created
a char there and checked it out, there were exactly the same number of
people in PoK at the time, and roughly the same number of traders up).
And so there are a few people upset at "losing" their server name.
Understandable, I guess. I would be a little sad. A little. But
apparently this other server has some kind of "history". Apparently they
were one of the original launch servers, and how is it possible that my
"young" (we were split off a year after launch, way back in 2000) server
has the population to win the naming war, and how the name change is
disrespectful to the uberguild they used to have (not anyone currently
complaining, of course, just people that used to play), and their
accomplishments, etc, and how we have fewer players but we all must
play multiple characters because we have our own term for multiboxing,
and our community sucks because our (unused except for a handful of
people) unofficial server board is an ezboard, oh the horror, and holy
crap, my head exploded.

To the whiny people of Mithaniel Marr:
I was going to post in the "petition" thread on the SOE boards in
support of keeping the MM name, after all, it was the original server.
But then I read the sanctimonious we-deserve-it-more whinefest it
actually was and had to change my mind. For once I actually agree with
Brenlo. Give all the servers numbers and be done with it.

To the good people of Mithaniel Marr:
I'm sorry some of your players are asshats. Some of ours are too. I'm
sure we'll all work together on /ignoring the combined asshat pool.

To the people from all affected servers currently whining in various
places about it:
Suck it up.
The servers are being merged based on population/activity (and maybe
economy - I noticed things were pretty similar prices in "our" bazaars).
So you're not being merged with the server you split off/from. You won't
get to see your friends from 4-5 years ago, if they still even play.
Different servers are in different situations... they're not turning
back time, they're making new servers.
Guess what? Everyone gets a free /movelog. Use it. Everyone is in the
same boat, whether they are "merging with another server" or "having
another server merge with them". There is really no difference.

In short: Shut the hell up and make new friends. PoK will still be in the
same place, although Burned Woods is off Shadowhaven this week.
