Yes - from the EQ Main Menu, go to ACCOUNT, and it will open a web
browser.  Log in, and you'll have the option to cancel your
subscription.

You'll be able to play until your pre-paid year expires.  

Then at that time, you can put in a month payment (which will continue
month-to-month until cancelled)
