Hi:

I'm now just over halfway through level 45 and have a very effective root
'n' nuke strategy, and yet I want to learn something that I've heard so much
about, but very little on how to do it - namely quad kiting.

I solo 99% of the time, I just enjoy soloing more than grouping, but can a
Wizard (or other class) please explain to me how to learn the art of quad
kiting? How on earth can I snare two, three of four light blue mobs, keep
them together and kill them? Obviously casting time of my spells is a big
factor, so some simple tips on which spells to use (ie Bonds of Force & and
an AoE spell) to get me started would be very welcome. I have T Boots which
should help and am currently hunting near the bridge to the IC zone in
Eastern Wastelands. As I run to the bottom of the bridge and head east I
come across a small camp of Orcs, this was where I thought I'd try my
kiting, although I am very wary of being aggroed by other mobs that roam.
Perhaps I should play safe and try a very low level Kobold camp where even
if my quad kiting goes wrong I have no chance of dying? I have a full book
of spells for my level.

Thank you very much in advance for your help. I can't believe the enjoyment
I get from EQ, here I am at level 45 still feeling I have so very much to
learn - what other games gives me that?

Regards ...

Stevie.
