A  combination of the level of mobs you kill, and how many you kill.

Definitely get out of Freeport - not much there to give you experience.

You're looking for mobs that /con high blue or even (white/black).

Con messages: (Stolen from http://necro.eqclasses.com/messages.asp )

-6 or less, Green, looks like a reasonably safe opponent
-5, Blue, You would probably win this fight.. it's not certain though
-4, Blue, looks quite risky, but might be worth a try
-3, Blue, looks quit risky
-2 and -1, Blue, looks kind of dangerous
Even con Black/White, he appears to be quite formidable.
+1 and +2, Yellow, looks like quite a gamble
+3 or more, Red, what would you like your tombstone to say 

Best exp for the expenditure of mana: "high" blue, the ones that con with
the "looks kind of dangerous" message.

Also remember, as a pet class, your pet can "steal" exp from you. If your
pet does more than 50% of the damage to a mob, then your pet gets 50% of
the exp. Make sure you always do more damage to the mob than your pet does
or it'll take you twice as long to gain levels.
