It's weird that the warrens has less of an xp bonus than crush; you can
really get massive trains in the warrens, or just a small train of wizard
bats that can nuke a level 50 to death..

It's funny but the low level guys can get huge xp bonuses in the city zones
fighting fish and you can get out if too badly hurt. I played around with my
bow and discovered i could kill a piranha without retribution. I thought you
couldn't hurt mobs in water if you weren't? Ah well. Thurgadin also has some
decent mid level mobs. I always think it's a shame i could never persuade a
group to help me kill dark elves in neriak; sure the trains would be lethal
but surely the xp bonus would make up for it? Or are dark elves always
undercons?


Wow. Lake of Ill Omen. 60. They really hated that zone. The Grey is 65?
Isn't that supposed to be tough? Never been there. Umbral seems underrated;
my memories of how quickly you could die there versus PoJ seems to imply the
xp bonus is wrong; still, perhaps the loot makes up for it. I never saw
decent loot in PoJ, too low level perhaps.
