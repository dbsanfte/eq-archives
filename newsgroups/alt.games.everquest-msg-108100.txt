That was kind of funny, but rude also.

If you posted the names of the keys, we can probably tell you where they go
to  (btw, the skyshrine key, called "Shrine Key", is the key that you click
on the statue to zone out into cobalt scar)

ToFS 1-2 is Crystal Key
ToFS 2-3 is 3-fingered key
ToFS 3-4 is Frosty key
ToFS 4-5 I don't have so can't tell you

The Najena keys are crap and you can destroy them unless you -like- going
there and killing greenies
