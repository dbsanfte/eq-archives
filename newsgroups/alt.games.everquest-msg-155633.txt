Well, the smart arsed reply to that is:

**Monks**

Forage Ass -> Monks now have an ability to have their asses handed to them
on various types of platters. Usage: automatic proc during combat.

**Warriors**

Snicker at Monk-> Warriors will now automatically /em "points derisively at
monk stain and cackles gleefully" every time a monk in the general vicinity
procs Forage Ass.
