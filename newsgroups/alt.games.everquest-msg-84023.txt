Yes, that was me.  The difference is that Hadden doesn't have a room
full of 50+ guards that summon.  If those guys had just wanted to move
on down to Phinny's room and kill him, there is absolutely nothing  we
could have done about it, since our group(s) could only pull one guardian
at a time and kill it, then do another...we could handle 2, but that's it.

Under play nice, if they'd brought a AoE group in and nuked the guardians
and Phinny out from under us, there's nothing we could say.  Nobody
"owns" a camp.  What they did was  deliberately train us all to cause
exp-death (14 people dead), and then set up to start single pulling and
killing guardians before they took Phinny from the same room we'd
planned on getting him.  No different than if a bunch of lowbie necros are
meeting in the EC tunnel and a monk brought Sgt. Slate to 'em and
Feigned.

Again, if they could have just moved in and got him, we would have
been upset, but have no real reason under the rules to bitch.  They
got NPC's to wipe us out, and then tried to move in on Phinny and
do what we'd been doing with no real trouble.  Before the GM
got to them.
