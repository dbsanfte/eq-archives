Heh...  I play a 39 Druid, and lately, me and a few guildies have been in
Eastern Wastes hunting Ulthorks... In this group, I'm generally the primary
puller (we got no tanks with us... LOL).  Anyway, I made myself an Incoming
hotkey, that casts snare on the mob, and then, in group, says "You've ruined
your own lands, %t!  You'll not ruin mine!"  Needless to say, I got thwapped
by all my groupmates... but they thought it was funny... :)
