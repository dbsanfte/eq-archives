the buyer makes that decision, if he doesn't think its fair then he 
doesn't buy, however the buyer can not dictate the price to the seller, 
the seller sets the price.  The seller can decide if he wants to sell a 
few(or none) for a higher price or many more for a lower price, this is 
why rarity affects price.

Rarity and inherent value of the item to the buyer is what determines 
its worth, not the effort exerted by the seller to produce it.
