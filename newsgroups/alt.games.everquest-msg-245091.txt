Gimped?  Hehe, so every twinked toon in the game is gimp?  Anyway, when you
are in a group with a capable tank then you can do very well.  But when your
tank sucks and you as a monk get beat on then the class has a big struggle.
My whole point is that as one of the three pure melee classes Monks need to
be able to take hits better.  Or if not take hits better then, to be able to
do things to a mob to slow it down physically even if such things do not add
to the DPS of the class.  As was posted earlier in the thread, it looks like
the Melee improvements 3 are all but dead for the time being.  This is a
shame considering the developers know melees need more productive things to
do in groups.  Otherwise the whole notion of melee improvements would not
have been offered by the devs.

The groups I pull for find it very amusing to see me run back to them for
every pull and FD at the feet of the MT but dang, do monks need to be such
wimps when it comes to things like that?  I played a Warrior FOREVER when I
first started the game.  Playing a Monk now, pulling is a breeze.  I love
the class minus the poor way it takes damage.  The other night in fact I was
grouped with a Paladin, SK, ENCH, Wizard and BST.  It was a Normal Slaughter
LDoN and we had to kill 53 mobs in 90 minutes.  Only healer we had was the
Paladin.  At 46, most mobs conned white or yellow to my monk.  We recorded
our 53rd kill with less than 2 minutes left.  That was the best LDoN
adventure I have been on up to this point simply for the satisfaction of
knowing our group pulled it out.  Positives for the class have been that the
hate wipe after approximately 2 minutes and the lulls are very nice.
Negatives are the weakness of the class to take hits or the inability of the
class to do things to mobs other than beating on them.  Things like leg
sweeps, throws, or a move that could stun a mob.  Something that is uniquely
geared towards a Martial Artist.
