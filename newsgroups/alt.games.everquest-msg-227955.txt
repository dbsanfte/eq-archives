I have been reading about some exploit in the game that has allowed players
to create platinum somehow. It might be duping or something; not sure, don't
really care.  I guess the SOE programmers have been able to shut down
whatever it was and some accounts have even been banned, I hear. I have also
heard that it has at least temporarily driven up the supply-demand pricing?

Anyone know how much of this is true?
