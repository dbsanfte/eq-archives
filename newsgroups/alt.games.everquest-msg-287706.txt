A new profession is being introduced to the game, the Inscription.
they can of course create the class glyphs used to improve the spells
of all classes, but there are also a few more things they can do.

We=92re teasting the beta, here are some information about it:
They can create vellums used by enchanters to store their enchantments
for later use. Basically, this is the item used to sell enchantments
at the Auction House.

Inscribers can also make Stats enhancement scrolls like the Scroll of
Strength IV or any other scroll. They can also create Scroll of Recall
but its use will be restricted to other inscribers.

To create most of their items, Inscribers will need a parchment
(bought from NPC vendors) and Inks. The inks are created with pigments
obtained by milling herbs gathered by herbalists.

It=92s hard to discrib all the informations about Inscription. It works
the same way as prospecting for jewelcrafters.
