We have no context to answer that question, never having played EQ2.
Like every other new mmorpg that comes out, it could suck enormously
and send people back to Everquest in droves. 

A newbie can have fun in EQ more than ever, though. On an established
server the economy is VERY pro-newbie, with many tradeskill items you
can sell in the bazaar while afk to then buy FANTASTIC gear you can
afford in the bazaar which is NOT "newbie" at all.
