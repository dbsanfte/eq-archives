Yeah, that makes up for everything!

I don't care for France, never did. I've been there several times and for
weeks and find the people, in general, arrogant and toxic! A close friend of
mine dated a French student for a long time. She lived just outside of Paris
and said that her friends in France despised America and Americans in
general. They though she was crazy for coming here, to the US, so long.
Parisians were rude and obnoxious to me and others I were traveling with, we
were not all Americans, they seem to hate the English and Israelis just as
much.

Its funny but some of the nicest people I have met have been New Yorkers!
They are quick tongued and a bit rough, but quick to help and talk. I also
found New Englanders and West Coasters a friendly bunch to all.
