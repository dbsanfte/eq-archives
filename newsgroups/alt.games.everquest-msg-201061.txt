You missed a bit here.
The fudge factor :-P
Remeber hell levels well they were cause by an additional multiplyer 
here. It used to run from 1 (at level 1) upt to 3.1 at level 60. Now 
when they cleared the hell level problem they did not remove this 
multiplyer they just smoothed the curve.

So Currently your formular has level 60 costing about 1/3 as much xp as 
it should.

To be honest I'm not sure how best to put this in to the equation.
The multiplyers used to be :
1-29    1.0
30 -34  1.1
35 -39  1.2
40 -44  1.3
45 -50  1.4
51      1.5
52      1.6
53      1.7
54      1.9
55      2.1
56      2.3
57      2.5
58      2.7
59      3.0
60      3.1

I have no idea about over 60.

The effect of this on the rest of it is that the 

lowest members of the party will effectivly level faster

than the higer members.
