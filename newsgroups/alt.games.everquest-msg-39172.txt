Also not important unless you are an Iksar but Iksar blood is a rare drop
off the Iksar slaves. Nurga is however a very safe zone to fight in. There
are no wanderers and most spawns are doubles or singles. Almost all do not
see invisible but a very few spiders. Not to mention the XP in Nurga rocks.
The casters can be trouble though if you are not ready for them.
