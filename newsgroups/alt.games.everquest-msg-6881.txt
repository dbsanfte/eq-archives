Actually, there are some Geforce mx cards out there for PCI that have 64 meg
and do a good job of matching Voodoo5 performance. They are around the
$150.00 range and as a bonus, you get full support. I have been a Voodoo
fanatic since the Voodoo2 days, and hate to give my support to any other
card,
but since you probably want to buy new games from time to time, support is a
MAJOR concern. I have an AGP hercules prophet ][ mx (64 meg) and am having
lots of luck with it. When I bought it, there was a card right beside it
that had the
same chipset as the one I bought but was a PCI card. Same price, $149.00.
