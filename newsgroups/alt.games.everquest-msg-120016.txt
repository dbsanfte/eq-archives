Conteract Disease cast twice in a row (Clerics and Druids)
Abolish Disease cast once (shaman only spell)
Cure Disease cast ten times in a row (hybrid healers)

Previously you could mine your way down at random to
the offending icon with cancel magic line, and previous
to that could purposefully position an empty slot for
the slow to appear as the first "buff" to be removed...
as far as I know slows are no longer removable by
cancel magic but I could be wrong, I certainly haven't
tried since the ability to cherry pick the offending icon
instead of substituting a hand grenade for a flyswatter
was added.

some camps more on "remove slow" duty than on heals
