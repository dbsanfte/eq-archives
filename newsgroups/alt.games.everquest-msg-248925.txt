I have a friend kinda like that.  When he hit 60 though he moved to the planes
and is now in a raiding guild.  He knows *every* planes zone like the back of
his hand and gives *me* advise on where to go.
I love LDON.  My thought?  Add more!! In different zones to get people
moving!!! with different kinds of mobs and make some outdoor, so those outdoor
spells can be utilized.  And do something so that level 62s will play with
level 57s again so I can put a group together in 20 minutes like I used to.
