Had the same problem with the 10th ring war in GD till it got fixed. Seems
like some of theUber Guilds just start some of these things and leave.
Varant wouldn't admitt there is a problem and force a zone repop. GMs
response is always there is a quest going on the zone will repop when is
completed.
