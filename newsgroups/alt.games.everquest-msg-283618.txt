I have my system automatically update... which didn't work, it was 
running 9.0c but apparantly missing one of the data files or something. 
  Loaded the whole thing over again from the DX site and worked fine.

The "no Play button" problem appeared to be unrelated to that.

Another thought, have you tried just checking the autoplay button?  Then 
you might not need a play button. Sloppy but viable, perhaps.
