Isn't "increased cost of living" cause by little increases in
bills and other expenses?

Isn't inflation due to the cost of items rising?

Isn't minimum wage raised due to the two above?

As for "market forces", by golly, I surely can't
comprehend anything like that.  About the best I
can suggest is that "market forces" are due to
people's income and therefore spending levels.
Hmm... seems similar to what's written above.

You know very well what I mean -- stop picking your
zits and beating it to Sculley's paused image on
your TV -- the X-files are obviously messing with
your mind.  The Comic Book Store Guy on the
Simpsons is not the role model your parents wanted
you to follow.

Of course, I could be wrong and you might be one
of the people who subscribes to the belief that you
should never question anything or make suggestions.
Life is perfect already -- why even try?
