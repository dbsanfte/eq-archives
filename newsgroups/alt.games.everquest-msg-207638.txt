that is the loom, grats on finding it, that's not an easy one to find.
One tip with armor quests, you have to comine the items without the 
pattern in the leafrunner pack you recieved when you asked your guild 
master about the quest.  Then you take the cloth you get and combine 
that with the pattern for the piece in the loom or sewing kit.

Good luck.

Here's a few links that are helpful:
everquest.allakhazam.com quest info
eqtraders.com tradeskill info (look up the armor quest info there, it's 
easier to find) also look up tailoring skill, you can make things to 
wear with some of the stuff you loot.  I know on my first character, I 
was ecstatic to find that wolf pelts actually were useful.
eq.crgaming.com look up your class there, has lots of spell information, 
including where to get the spells and what they do.
