So, this raving fangirl, who knows a little Quenya and Sindarin, used
to be a council member in the Tolkien society in the town she studied
in, and who would have worn her cloak to the midnight opening last
night if she could have gone, went to see Fellowship of the Ring
(without cloak, since it wasn't THE opening screening). 

And what does she do?

During the scenes in Moria at Balin's grave, she catches herself
thinking, 'imagine if they could Gate'.

She also wishes EQ's (runed) mithril tunic looked like chain instead
of leather, and that EQ's leather looked like that.

Now she has to go toss her dwarven guildleader. Preferably by his
beard.
