The best advice I can give you is to use the /tar command in hotkeys
to checkup on crucial and fragile members of the raid, ie Enchanters.
Heal em a lot, even if you dont need to. Also, have one for the main
tank, watch him too :)

And groovy technique is to use /assist in a hotkey ON THE MOB to see
who it is aggroing at the time, heal as required.

Doing this can save the day, and ppl dont even know who it is :)

If there is a 60 Cleric comming along likely you will buff tanks
rarely, as Aegolism is a all in one buff and lasts for 3 hours or so.

Expect to Symbol etc all the casters and such, again EXCEPT the
enchanters, they will get the best.
