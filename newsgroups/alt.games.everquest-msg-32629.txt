These are all helpful before the fact things, and I appreciate them.  We are
not networked, and have shared our info with no one.  Do any of you know who
to contact and how once typical accountstatus folks say they aren't going to
help you?  I don't know if this is correct or not, but it seems that if
someone were going to hack into EQ and they surely wouldn't use their own
account to do so, even if they had one.  Don't know why nobody at Sony
Online seems to even be able to fathom that as a possibility.  I am about to
say to heck with them even if Star Wars is with them, but it's so irritating
being kicked off because someone else wronged us.  rrrrrrr
