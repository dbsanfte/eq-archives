Here's my opinion on guilds- and I have been in both bad and good
guilds, and have watched a few others.

A guild should have a purpose- whether it be to promote evil role
playing, tradeskills, encouraging newbies, or just an excuse for a bunch
of friends to easily stay in touch. This purpose should be stated when
it is created. Every member who seeks to join should know what that
purpose is, and agree with it, and work toward that common goal (even if
it is to meet once a week in Kelethin and have drunken SoW races up the
ramp to the bank from the POD lift). If you can't agree with its
purpose, don't join.

The guild develops a reputation as much as your character's name will.
If I group with three different people from a certain guild that I think
are jerks, I'll stop grouping with folks from that guild. If I have a
great time grouping with a couple of people from a certain guild, I will
seek out others. I will tell my guild about the other guilds I like and
dislike. Our guilds might even start planning parties together, or
sharing raids, or alliances.

The shouting for a guildmates during formation and bribery to join a
guild is, if I remember right, something you can petition them for. 

Good way to find a guild is to watch the guildtags of the people you
enjoy grouping with, and ask them for more information about their
guild. Or a websearch, if your server has a webpage. EZ Board and Guild
Magic both have a lot of guilds too. Most guilds don't usually shout for
new members.
