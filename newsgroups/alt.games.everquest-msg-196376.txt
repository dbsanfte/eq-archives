Sounds like he may have temporarily lost control of some of his swarm 
kite and allowed one to peel off toward you. If during the time he breaks 
his charm on his pet to kill it so he can charm another, he wanders a bit 
too close to you, some could very easily switch to you. He should have a) 
had plenty of room out there to keep em off of you, and b) apologized at 
the very least.
