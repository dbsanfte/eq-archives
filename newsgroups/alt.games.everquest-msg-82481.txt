I'm a warrior 41. Just need to know what weps to buys as I get higher, I
have a Centi Longsword 14 27 and a Velium Short Blade 10 24.
I have read that lower delay weps are a must for taunting, since I am
grouped most of the time these days. Not sure what trade off there should be
with delay/damage.
Also, which wep goes in offhand, the faster or slower delay. I ask cos I
have read conflicting reports on this.

Thx
