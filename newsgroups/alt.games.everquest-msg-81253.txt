These are all great and all, and they've fixed a lot of roaches(big bugs)
but they still missed a major one.  People using ATI graphics cards still
cannot ride a boat without suffering a very horrid form of motion sickness,
in which everything about the boat fragments as soon as you step on.  This
has caused several occasions where I've ended up swimming from the Zone line
after leaving the ODUS zone and entering the Qeynos port zone.  I've had one
character drown (making the body unrecoverable) and another nearly drown.

Any ideas on when they will get this fixed.  I've sent them a couple of
emails just asking for an estimate and all I've recieved are the same
generic automated responses.
