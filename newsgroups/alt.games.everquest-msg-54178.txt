There are various gem merchants all over Norrath. Don't know where you
are currently, but I know for a fact that there's one in Qeynos, one in
Kelethin, and one in Highkeep. (my personal favorite.) If you're looking
for mobs that drop those things, they seem to be rather random off a
variety of mobs. I do know that the star rubies and fire emeralds both
drop off Seafury Cyclops in Ocean of Tears. I've looted a bunch of them
there meself.
