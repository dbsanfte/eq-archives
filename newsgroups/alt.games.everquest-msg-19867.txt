I suspect you have no idea what you're talking about.
Until the recent increase in drops of level 39 Velious spells, Ro's
Fiery Sundering went for anywhere between 5k to 10k per copy.

This is a fire resist debuff that is checked on Dragon Breath
resistence table--meaning it's harder to resist that lures!

Yes, except for necro's Scent line.

>Does anyone really use it?

*EVERY* high level raiding druid (those with a buttload of money)
casts this debuff against raid level mobs.  Why?  Because with Ro +
Malo + Occulsion, against a mob like a ToV wurm makes Wildfire do 1024
instead of 10.  That means you can potentially drop the wurm before it
manages to get gate off.

Start going up against raid level mobs and you'll see how important
debuffs become.

Ro is about the most assinine level spell in the game.  A level 39
spell that's used almost exclusively by level 55+ druids.
