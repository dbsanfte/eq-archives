I think they spawn back in like 1 minute though... And they don't give 
xp. And the only loot was a non zoneable robe and staff (plus the stuff 
they had been handed)

At least they gave it to everyone who already had tribute...

This really needs to be raid/group only.
We have 'calls' in Final Fantasy. They make various chimes, trumpet 
calls, and drum beats. They also are only usable by members of your 
party or alliance, so you can threaten to kick them the hell outta your 
party if they don't stop with the 6 second call every time they turn on 
attack.

Bah, who needs heal when you have stunlock.

My enchanter used to do halfway decent 'lazy' soloing with stunlock and 
my 'lil hasted buzzsaw friend.

Ah but this will be required raiding.

I can't understand the EQ graphics engine. Given the relative quality of 
graphics it should flat out scream (well, maybe up until recently, have 
not seen recently) but it stumbles around like an ancient drunk gorilla.

Of course it likely has something to do with the de-optimizations they 
put in... Up until the last two weeks of beta the SWG engine ran like a 
finely tuned racing engine. During one 'let's crash the world' event I 
had several hundred people on my screen and could still deal with it.
A week after release 40 people = slideshow.

This is the EQ copy of WoW's 'nodrop' system. Items become 'soulbound'. 
Either soulbound on pick up (almost all quested items, which really 
sucked for me on about 1 quest in 4 where every selectable reward was 
unusable... fortunatly vendors still bought them for some small amount 
of coin) or soulbound on equipped... anything 'neat' dropped by a mob. I 
got more of those types of items through the Auction block than through 
drops... in fact I think I got one through drops, and everything I wore 
was soulbound on the last day.


> They forgot to mention Level up to 70.
Maybe they forgot to put it in...
