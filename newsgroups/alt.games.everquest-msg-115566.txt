I certainly hope Elite wouldn't have enough money to advertise with,
otherwise they deserve a good beatdown.  Fansubbing is a copyright
infringment (albiet, one that few of the rights holders choose to crack down
on, as long as the title's not comercially available in the states), and
most fansubbers don't charge for their work.  In the old days, you would
have to send them the cassette, so that there was no question that they
weren't profitting.

Oh, and if you're into fansubs, check out Clamp's Chobits.
