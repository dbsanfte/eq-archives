I have been unable to locate the article in their online version, and
I'm far too lazy of a bastard to retype the whole thing here, but if you
pick up the current issue of Maxim Magazine, there's an article on EQ
GM's in there on page 120. It's got a picture of the box cover from SoL,
three screen shots that appear to be from Freeport, KD, and Velks, a
capture of a barbarian rogue type, and a female human melee type in full
Ry'Gorr. The article focuses primarily on GM's and their job. ("Because
even online role-playing game freaks need someone to serve and protect
them.")
  There are interviews and snippets of conversation with Gary Matthews,
Michelle Butler (a.k.a Elionia) and Travis Wiglesworth (a.k.a. Rhuyai),
as well as a description of the GM room out at EQ's home base. Some of
the statements sound like total BS but it was kind of entertaining.
