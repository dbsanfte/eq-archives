Hey I bought the guide..not bad...the plat making section was the best
and the how to level fast I'm still working on..only have gotten about
1 level every 2 hours though...I'm kind of a beginner though.  My
character is a 18th warrior now and I need to raise some platinum for
high end gear to kick even more arse.
