Sounds right, 40% more damage for BL 65% slow, 20% more damage for 
Enchanter 70% slow.  It's all in how you look at it.  With shaman 
slowing, mob does 25% of the damage it would have done unslowed.  With an 
Enchanter slowing, it does 30% of the unslowed damage, and BL slow, it 
does 35% of the unslowed damage.  So, at 300DPS unslowed, it will do 
75DPS with shaman slow, 90DPS with enchanter slow, and 105DPS with BL 
slow.  Guess it's fairly subjective as to whether you consider that 
"far" better or not.
