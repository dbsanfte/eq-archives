This nerf sucks so hard. I don't AE kite, I tried it a few times and made
a few AA but I didn't enjoy it that much. This nerf hits me when I use
AE songs for slows and MR debuff, because I rarely stand still. Bards
melee while casting unlike other classes, so need to be on the move to
follow mobs being pushed around.

I never was that good at AE kiting, but I don't think those who were got
that much exp after the nerf on Extended Notes with PBAE songs. Myself,
I'll just keep grouping for exp tyvm.

AE kiting was due a nerf but it would have been nice if it didn't affect
those of us who don't do it.
