OK, I'll bite.  Could you please explain this further?  My main is a 60
beastlord, so I am undoubtedly biased, but I'm willing to listen.

To me, what makes the beastlord stand out is that is a melee class that
can actually solo effectively.  Granted, my best strategy is to go for
mobs near the blue/light blue border and mow them down, rather than
tackling high blues.  Just about every other "solo" class (druid,
necro, etc.) operates on the principle "if it never hits you, its DPS
doesn't matter".  Beastlords have slow, haste (at 60+), SoW, a powerful
pet, healing spells (weak, but far better than nothing), a mana regen
buff, weak melee buffs, and are built for melee.  We are very diverse.
The main reasons I chose a beastlord were because I could effectively
solo, I could kill things by melee (for me, more fun), and I could
throw buffs around in groups or to passing strangers.

On the other hand, we don't challenge the specialists.  I throw very
few buffs when grouped with a shaman (or people who got Focus of
Whatever before leaving PoK), and having a shaman or enchanter around
means my slow sits idle.  Mage pets are stronger, and a group is in
trouble, if a beastlord is main healer.  Other classes give better DPS.
 In my experience, I have rarely been in a full group (not counting
groups of 2-3) where there was not a specialist (shaman, enchanter,
etc.) that did something better than I did, so I have rarely felt that
my diversity was putting someone else out of work.  I frequently solo
or end up in small groups (one or two guildies, generally), but I
attribute that to a consequence of playing off-peak hours.  One of a
beastlord's greatest challenges is the effort required to "keep up".
If a ranger gets his first 21% haste item, his DPS goes up 21%, a
wizard with Improved Damage gets a flat 10% DPS boost, and a monk with
a new weapon can look straight at the damage/delay ratio to compute his
overall DPS boost.  A beastlord's DPS is divided among many different
sources (DoT, nuke, melee, pet), so one upgrade has a much smaller
impact for us than for anyone else.

Anyway, I agree that beastlords are a strong class.  For what it's
worth, the consensus on the beastlord forums is that our class is
generally in good shape, but we start to fall behind somewhere around
the 65+/Time+ level of progression.  As I am only 60, that is beyond my
experience.  However, I do not understand how they are something "wrong
with EQ".  I have never met a group that was unwilling to go until a
beastlord joined up, or until getting beastlord buffs in PoK.  I have
not noticed a flood of beastlords, such that most groups either have at
least 2 or are competing with a nearby solo-er.  It seems to me that we
are right where we ought to be.  I would like to hear your perspective.
