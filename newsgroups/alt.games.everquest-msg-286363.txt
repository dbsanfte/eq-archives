It's the norm for low end.  It's fairly common for business-oriented medium
end.  For gaming machines, mid through high end will all have discrete
graphics cards (or in a very few cases, and in laptops, an onboard chip, but
it'll have the same designator as a card, and be NVidia or ATI branded with a
model number that you can look up and compare to other cards.

Yes, or to buy a machine with a higher-end card in it already.

Depends on definition of "decently priced".  Dell insprion 530 is $509 for a
core 2 duo, 1GB RAM, NVidia 8300GS, no monitor or keyboard (assuming you
already have those).  This should be a fairly usable low-end gaming machine.
You can double the price and go to 2gb ram, a bit faster processor, and an
NVidia 8600GT, which makes it a pretty decent midrange box.
