Nope, I "pay" for three accounts.
I have access to over 16, approaching 20+ now.  As guildies retire or
decide to "leave" the game (which usually means they go away until the
next expansion), I get to "own" that account (they usually keep paying
since they do occasionally pop in to say hi to friends).

I have access to pretty much every class in the game at level 60.
Kinda nice to be able to pick and choose like that.  Kinda sucks
having to drive multiple toons at times.

Yes, it's a clear violation of the EULA so sue me.
