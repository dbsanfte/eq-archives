Not at all.  You don't have to be dead center behind a mob to be able to
backstab it.  You just need to be anywhere in the rear 180 degree arc.
(It's a little smaller than that, can't be dead on to the side of it, but
not much.)

On even the smallest mobs, there is easy room for 3 to 5 rogues to be able
to backstab, without crowding each other.   On big ones you could fit an
army behind it.  Two rogues is no problem at all.
