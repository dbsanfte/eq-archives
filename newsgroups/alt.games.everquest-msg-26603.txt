I have a lvl 20 paladin and use Lull all the time. I try to hunt near a good
group or
a zone line for when the Lull is resisted, and always get a SOW before I
solo the
group. But I prefer to group and pull. And to the person that said Paladins
are no
good for solo or pulling, I am one of the more well known pullers in ill
omen and,
while I might have a bit of downtime, I solo well against blues and some
evens. My
HP get down to less than 1 bbl sometimes, but haven't had to trigger the
Paladin
last chance (LOH) in quite a while. Then I just use all my mana up healing
myself full
and usually my mana is almost full by the time I finish my next fight.
