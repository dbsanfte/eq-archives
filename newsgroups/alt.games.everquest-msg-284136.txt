That is exactly correct.  However, with the shroud system it is much
less difficult to get a solo LDoN at 17 than it used to be.  although
at 17, 2 or 3 people tends to be closer to the ideal.  its possible to
solo if massively twinked and buffed, but at that level I have found a
duo to be more effective, mostly because at lower levels, dps tends to
lag behind the LDoN curve.  Also, IMO, unless you are leveling an LDoN
charm, there is little benefit in doing LDoNs at that level.  XP and
cash loot are much quicker in a variety of quiet spots.
