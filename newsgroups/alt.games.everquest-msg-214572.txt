I am currently wearing a full suit of Initiate's/Darkness armor and wielding
Mooglan's Sword of Darkness. I'm at level 9 now. I will be using 2h slash as
my main but I want to have the fastest 1h I can get sooo...

1. At what level should I start looking to upgrade armor and weapons?

2. What armor should I upgrade to?

3. What 2h slash should I look for?

4. Which style (blunt or slash) has the fasted weapons?
