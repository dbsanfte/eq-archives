Just give me the best information you have.  Track shows mob is to the nw.
I will look at my map and hopefully figure it out.

That is false.  The only mob that spawns late is in an assassination job
where he spawns after so many mobs have died.  Rescue mob spawns at start,
and so do all other names.  Raid dungeons may differ.  I do understand that
even ranger track may not cover the whole dungeon.

Believe me that bards understand hectic.  But we all do the best we can.
:-)  If you havent already, it helps to change the background color of the
track window.  I changed mine to bright green so the blue mobs are easy to
read.
