Yeah, there's more on this idea at: http://www.AllianceofMagic.com

Basically, make a social that combines all 3 of these skills, throw a /LOC
on the end and then bind the keyboard key that you use for moving forward,
back left and right to your hot keys 1 and 2 or 9 and 10... then copy this
social to both of those keys. When you move, you practice all 3. My DRU is
never short of food or lost. ;)
