Hi,

I'm considering picking-up SoL, even though I don't really
need it right at this moment.  :^)

In shopping around, it seems that Sony has fixed the price
(as on pretty much all Sony products these days) so you pay
the same amount mail-order or in-store: ~$29.99.

One of my friends got SoL when it was first released for
~$14.00 at Best Buy, but unfortunately, at that time, I
was not back "into" EQ (a little detour through DAoC land).

So, does anyone know of any places that sell SoL for a
more reasonable price than $30 -- maybe an online store
with a sale or discount code?

Thanks,
Mike
