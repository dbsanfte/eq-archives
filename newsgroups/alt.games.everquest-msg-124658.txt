The thing is that it's not necessarily MY logic justifying a druids
role in EQ, it's Verants too.  YOU might have your idea of what a
priest class is suppose to be and Verant has theirs.  Since it's
Verant's world, their view holds.

How so?  We can make whatever points we want and what SHOULD be, but
if it doesn't relate to the game it means fuck all.  Game balance is
THE point.

I never use tracking for routine play, which to me is just exp
grinding.  Now if you're looking for a specific mob, doing something
like the hunter/forager cycle in TT, rangers got it made.  At 49, I
can filter out the green crap (not that there is much in TT at 49
that's green, but there are still a few), I can sort it by distance or
by spawn, and I can cover a much, MUCH larger area.

While I like being able to track with my druid, ranger tracking has me
spoiled because it's much much handier.
