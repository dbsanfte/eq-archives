Nice to see someone is polite.  /wave to Dave

BTW....no one is "forcing us" to use the gateway.  It is simply
something in place for those who may not be able to access the usenet
groups any other way.  Many offices do block access to newsgroups even
through programs like Outlook Express.  

Funny thing is, I've used various other newgroups (never this one) and
I don't seem to recall most of the users there being quite so "holier
than thou" Anyways, enjoy your newsgroup, this will most likely be my
last looksie whether through a newgroup reader or the gateway.
