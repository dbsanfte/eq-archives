Save your time and hunt Oasis until 20 or 22 then head to ill omen and solo
in front of the windmill then the skel ruins after 27 and you should do
well.  It is true you can group in Ill Omen earlier than 22 but Oasis, will
help you learn the skills you need to really play a ranger and allow you to
be less dependent on groups where eventually you are bound to become the odd
man out unless you have special skills to offer and these you may not learn
without doing a lot of soloing.  Also use archery to pull in Oasis and both
your archery and fletching skills will increase remarkably.
