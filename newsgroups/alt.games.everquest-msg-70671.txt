True.  I can relate to this as some one who will be unemployed at the
end of the month without a new job to go to yet.  We've already been taking
steps.  Bottled water canceled.  Newspaper subscription canceled.  CableTV
dropped to basic.  I'll in preparation incase I cannot find a job in my desired
skillsets for a prolonged period and have to take a job that pays less than
what we currently need.  The list goes on.  EQ is on the list too, but we're
not there yet.  I pay for 3 months at a time, so hopefully we will not get that
far down on the list
