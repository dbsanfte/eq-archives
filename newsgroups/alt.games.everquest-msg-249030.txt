I realize you do.. but at the same time if we're 'goin random you
could end up with any snot nosed newly ebayed 15 year old getting the
invite and making a mockery of the meeting. Would I be fine with
someone from a lower guild who knew what he was talking about? Sure..
if it was shown they had backing and support of their guild, had a
good rep, and what not. Everquest is not a game you can learn
overnight.. and just grabbing a warm body is a good way to get one who
doesn't know it. That is my only concern.

They know exactly the problems with the game because they spent the
past 5 years(since PoP came out) dealing with them.
