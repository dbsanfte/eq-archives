That works in reverse also.  Extremists on either side of any issue
are never shy about attempting to demonize and/or marginalize any
real or imagined opposition to their position.

My personal opinion, as somebody who sold his rarely used hunting rifle
as a safety precaution once I had young children in the house, is:
Because a completely disarmed citizenry is at far too much of a
disadvantage vs. a corrupt government, we need the "gun nuts" and their
calmer fellow travellers out there making sure that the government does
not disarm us.  The best way I can see to determine if any given set of
restrictions on weapons is "reasonable" is to require the general
agreement of an informed and interested citizenry, of which the
advocates of gun ownership are an important part.
