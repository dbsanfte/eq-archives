And how about the Frogloks, who were systematically slaughtered by
generation after generation of young trolls and ogres in their Guk
home, and Iksar in Kuark not to mention every race in the game
pounding away in Sebelis and half a dozen more zones in Kunark.  I
don't see how orcs would be any less likely than the hopping fools of
Gukta... speaking of hopping, how about rockhoppers?  Nah, every
crafter in the game would be raiding your home town looking for those
"mint condition" hopper hides.

Hmm, now this, on the other hand suggests something more interesting
to me.  How about introducing a series of "changed" race states: set
up a way of changing your current race into one of the new ones;
undead versions of dwarves, elves, humans, etc; were versions of them
too; and perhaps some "good" version of change as well (counting
undead as evil and were as nuetral).  "angelic" perhaps?  At any rate,
the idea would be for the altered state to change stats and abilities
and faction, the whole magilla... but the change would apply to your
existing character.

Trouble with this idea is that the best thing (as far as EQ as a whole
is concerned) about new races and classes is that people start new
characters with them, which means a whole new journey from 1 to 65,
and gearing up, new life for the game.  If you can convert your 65
high elf cleric into a 65 Banshee cleric (undead elf for the ignorant
amongst you... and for the pedantic, Bain Sidhe) then there's not a
whole lot of starting over involved.
