hey have you heard about the table top version? guess not or else you would
be out looking for a game store to see if they sold the books that you need
"EverQuest Player's Handbook" would be a start.  next I would be looking for
gaming convention in my area to find a group that plays (even if you don't
find a EverQuest group, don't worry because EverQuest is based on th d-20
system so you can use your character in any d20 system game, Dungeons and
Dragons 3rd edition for example.) So quite your whinning and save your money
(to quote the ING guy) and by those books.
