Guards in GFay (and anywhere) can be real slow to react so they may not have
been given the time...of course sometimes they just don't want to know. The
trees you speak of are not Treants and are not on good faction with Guards
(or you'd be dead...the guards are never slow to react against PC's) you
don't get a faction hit.
If you yelled for help with none coming then that's a bit harsh that no one
was willing...I guess they might have thoughtthey'd piss off the Guards but
if the Guards aren't pounding you then they won't be pounding them either
:ï¿½/
Of course Yelling for help will normally gain only your pursuers death...the
amount of people that seem to think /y will get them healed and buffed is
astounding and often gets the killer of the mob(s) abuse...familiar pattern?
