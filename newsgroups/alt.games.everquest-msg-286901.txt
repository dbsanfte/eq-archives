Here is what�s going into Thursday morning�s Hotfix:


There were a few technical issues that we addressed today that require a 
server update and some downtime. We are sure for those affected they 
will welcome the fixes and for everyone else, thank you for your 
understanding.


Legends of Norrath crash related to the 8000 series NVidia cards
- This has been addressed and now the crash and gameplay problems should 
be addressed and working as intended.

Legends of Norrath Global Loot Drop
- The loot drop percentage has been fixed and now you will be able to 
obtain LoN loot from NPC's in game.

Custom UI's being scrambled when tabbed out to other windows
- We are aware of the problems players are having with custom UI�s and 
we are looking into the issue. In the meantime on of our developers has 
started a post called UI Problems and Workarounds and it is sticky�d on 
the forums. Please refer to that post while we do some work on our end.

New human NPCs loading into global memory
- This has been addressed and the standard Human models have replaced 
the models from the Test server.

Weapons with procs not working correctly
- This has been addressed and the weapons that were affected are now 
working as intended.
