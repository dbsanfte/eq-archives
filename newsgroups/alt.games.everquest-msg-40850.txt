I don't know how much you follow the NG, but DT and I don't see eye to eye
on much.  I'm very disturbed by what happened and yes, I'm emotional about
it.  It's impossible to hold a rational argument with DT, so there's no
point to even attempt it, so I sink to his level.  No, I'm not looking
forward to a war.  Nor was I looking forward to waking up to the news that
my country has been attacked.  This was an act of war, and will no doubt US
will declare war on the antagonists.  It's inevitible.  If I was looking to
start a flame war, I would open with a line like "Rangers sUx0rz".
