Yes, it is, but it obviously isn't yours. "Me either you people have
certainly passed the verant brainwashing test with flying colors I
must say!" Read that again. That is probably the worst grammar I've
seen here in months, aside from the generic d00d crap.

Yes, you can. You didn't have to sell the accounts at all. You
accepted the money. If you weren't greedy, you would have closed out
the accounts when you quit playing and been done with it.

...I say again: hypocrite. You have no room to dump on Verant for
being "greedy".
