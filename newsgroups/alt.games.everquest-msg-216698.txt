The drop rate just varies a huge amount.  The very first LDoN I went
on, a day or so after it was released, we failed the quest, partially
becaues we weren't familiar with LDoN dungeons, and partially because
the drop rate was extremely low.  Yesterday we had 3 or 4 of the
required item drop in one room, then went about 10 minutes w/o seeing
any.

One comment about "kick-ass groups": sometimes a group that thinks it
ought to be "kick-ass" becomes very undisciplined, which leads to
cleric and or enchanter wasting mana, which leads to failure.  Last
group I was in was pretty ordinary in terms of dps but we operated
like a well-oiled machine.  The pally pacified so we got one or at
most two mobs.  There wasn't any of this "I'll tank the other mob"
nonsense.  The puller kept moving and kept the group informed as to
when to move.  As an enchanter I really appreciated that, especially
after dealing with groups whose attitude was "we've got an enchanter,
lets pull the whole room".
