Yeah, all things considered I'm glad I took him out of mine.

Oh, crap, I am getting old. I've actually wondered what his handle
meant, and that never occurred to me.

I try not to as a general rule in my Usenet posting. That way, when I
do curse it has more impact. As for other people using profane
language, doesn't bother me in the least in Usenet. I'm capable of
determining if there's a useful message between the colorful bits.

Much of the time when I play EQ, I'm on the phone with a friend who is
also playing. Geeky and pathetic, I know, but it's a local call and it
beats the tar out of typing to one another. Anyhow, we both swear like
sailors the entire time. Any time we're together, in fact, except at
work.

Which takes us to the in-game topic, which I'll cover since I expect
someone will ask - In tells, group or guild, with known quantities (in
other words, among friends), I have no problem with reading or using
profanity. In broadcasts (say, ooc, shout or auction), *never*. For no
other reason except that it's against the rules.


Oh, yeah, and fuck you, and the Bizbee you rode in on!  :)
