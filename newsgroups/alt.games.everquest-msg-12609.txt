I was sitting in faymart by the bank this morning killing a little time when
I got hit by a begger.

a_begger_01   "Can I plz have some money?"

/con = anon

me                     "Sure, how much you wan't?"

a_begger_01   "whatever, 100?"

me                      "Ive got thousands"

a_begger_01   "250!"

me                     "what do you need the money for?"


a_begger_01   "stuff, can I have the money now"
a_begger_01   "plz giveme the plat"
a_begger_01   "come on!"

me                     "trying to come up with a way of saying exactly how
much I hate beggers! one minute PLZ"

a_begger_01   "are you giving me anything?"

me                     "begone!"

a_begger_01   "YOU SUCK!"
a_begger_01   "YOU ARE A JERK"
a_begger_01   over OOC "soandso IS A JERK!"

and then this

a_begger_01   "I'm actually level 20! so there, you jerk!"

lol

me                     "welcome to my ignore list"

a_begger_01   /em RUDE
a_begger_01   /em RUDE
a_begger_01   /em RUDE

me  sit
me pause 30 seconds
me  sneak/hide

a_begger_01   spins around a few times
a_begger_01   miraculously starts to equip all sorts of armor!

lol

I probably shouldn't have led him on but just had to see where it would go.
Really got a laugh at the "I'm actually level 20! so there, you jerk!" line,
like I got ripped off or something! LOL
