Hmm.  Ok, I gave this some thought, and I can't think of a single law 
that's broken.  It may be immoral.  I wouldn't argue that.  But there's no 
law against modifying software... Otherwise, anyone who ever used custom 
skins or levels in Quake would be liable.  Anyone who used custom 
desktops for windows...  It may be a violation of the EULA, but we've just 
hacked that out of existence, so suddenly (by ebayer logic) it doesn't 
apply to us.

Unless you'd like to admit that the EULA applies whether or not you 
actually click agree?
