I have no problem cussing, just don't see where it's needed. But I can see
where you might get that idea about me, but I have responded to pretty much
most of the posts, I do not ignore someone just because they cuss, but I
also think shit, fuck, piss, and damn are just extras to be thrown in to
make a point..like shouting.
Greater than thou? I'm sure I'm not, but I stick with my opinion on the
naming policy...because opinions are like assholes, everybodies got one....
