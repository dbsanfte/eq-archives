The problem with pulling a summoning mob with a nuke isn't what
happens late in the fight - it's what happens right after the nuke.

My buddy used to pull stuff from the CY in the Hole from the top
of the cliff with a nuke (while we were waiting for the top to
repop).  Once or twice he tried that with a Rock golem (51-54th
level).  BOOM - he gets summoned off the drop, and starts screaming
for the druid to come, drop and evac :)

I don't know what the threshold is on how much damage before they
summon, but he was using a 200ish pt nuke on critters with several k
hp and they'd summon.  So it doesn't take much.
