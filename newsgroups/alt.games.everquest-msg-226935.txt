I've noticed all of the above.  I don't mind doing it (when I was playing 
a rogue, it was pretty much my job till I wa full or almost encumbered), 
it's just my little gnome can't carry much at all.  And last night I had 
two mobs that landed with just a pixel or two that I could get on...and 
one that was COMPLETELY in the wall...not even the name visible.  that 
was probably the one that had the best loot, too!  Ah, but no matter, we 
still won.

And I thank the MT, healer(s), casters, ML, EVERYONE in the group  (but I 
single out the ML the most).  And if someone has been an exceptionally 
good group mate, I'll send them a /tell thanking them for a good 
experience.  Yet I don't /tell someone when they've been a disgrace to 
the game, hmm.  

Ah, well.  On a different note, I just finished my second adventure as 
leader.  Can't say I'm comfortable with the "job", but it fell to me.  (I 
started getting a group together and it stalled at 3...so I kept looking 
and recruiting people.  Got mostly "I'm camping" or "in a group now".  
Then, one of the people I had asked said that one of his people couldn't 
do the adventure, and asked if we wanted to merge.  So my Wiz (me) cleric 
and mage grouped with his Shadowk-nigget, pally and bst, and kicked ass 
(mass kill, 57 mobs, normal, 26 to 31 group).  Best part(s)?  3 of use 
dinged, and NONE of us died.  Closest we came was the pally getting down 
to 30%.

God it was fun!  And my leadership style paid off.."Everyone do what you 
do best, and we'll pull this off.  Let's go"  (that's near enough to what 
I said to them...'cause I ain't a leader in this game...yet.)

Anyway, I'm going to bed, maybe even resting.  G'nite

Miznit the tired 31 (DING!) wizard of E'ci.

(Who is considering a surname of Overnuke, but probably won't pick ANY 
surname)
