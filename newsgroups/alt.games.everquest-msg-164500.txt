My main is a 37 Barb Warrior, and it seems I am stuck in OT as that seems
to be the only place I find people.  I just was always too scared to run
through Najena as everyone told me that there are always wandering guards
to kill me.  Well I finally bit the bullet and took the run.

Id like to do crystal caverns, and I suggest it to groups I find but most
dont want to make the trek there and would rather just Kill in OT.  If I
just showed up at CC would it be likely I can get in a group?
