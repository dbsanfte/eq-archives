My favourites by far are necro/shaman or necro/druid...true a lot of their
skills overlap, but the killing is completely non-stop from level 1-60. Zero
downtime plays a huge factor, but exp grinding isn't what some people think
is best...

I don't see how rogue/necro would be fun or easy...the rogue will get too
much aggro and the necro couldn't keep the heals going that well. For brute
strength and future playability, cleric/warrior is a good combo. I have a
nice level 54 war and 53 cleric I have been playing regularly...it's a drag,
but I have no downtime.

Shaman/Monk could be extremely fun once you get up in levels a bit. I have
been moonlighting on another server from my normal one with this combo. As
for the post about a dru or shm not keeping up with the heals, that's a
farce...fight the right mobs and there won't be much downtime at all,
especially with an iksar monk and shaman.

Also note that a SK can easily replace the Necro for another great combo. I
have seen both druid/necro and a shammy/SK non-PL minimally twinked duos go
from 1-60 in 4 weeks...
