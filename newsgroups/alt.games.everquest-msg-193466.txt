I was near the Kael entrance in Wakening Land.

I decided to harmony of nature the overseer (red con) before pulling a
laborer (blue). Bad move. He resisted.

I managed to ensnare him, but root lasted only a second.
I landed drifting death and drones of doom. I thought it would be a simple
kite. I was ready to follow with immolate, creeping crud and stinging swarm,
but the summons started. After 5 or 6, I was dead.

I wonder if distance matters. If I stay just far enough out of melee range
to cast, maybe he would try to get near instead of summoning? Running away
certainly did not work.

Not that I'm eager to try the overseer again, but I hope a summoning mob is
not certain death when a solo caster engages one. Even if there is no way to
prevail, isn't there a way to survive?

(I do know one: the insta-cast port on the Leatherfoot Raider Skullcap, but
mine was used up and doing the quest for another one is time consuming).
