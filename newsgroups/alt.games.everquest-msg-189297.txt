A long time ago, in patch message far, far away.
A great nerf took place...

Around the releasee of RoK, all(?) Newbie Guards were meant to be
permanently buffed with resists etc, making much harder to kill than the
equivalent level mob, this pretty much makes them a poor choice for hunting.
The reason they get hunted so much is that they can often be found in low
number spawns or wanderers, making them an ok choice for solo players.

Qeynos guards, without some previous faction work, will be KoS anyway so
there isn't a faction issue there and by hunting them you will improve your
faction with Bloodsabres so will be able to use the merchants and bank in
Sewers.

There are corrupt Qeynos Guards (who are allied with Kane Bayle and the
Bloodsabres) that are mixed in with the normal guards around Qeynos, there
is a tower of these in WK that was always a popular druid solo spot. I
wonder if this is what your friend meant because I can think of no other
guards you could single pull and hunt for Exp in the Qeynos area, even with
two of you.

Reskin and Tolus in EC were also popular hunting spots but I think they get
left alone now the Bazaar is up, these two are militia and so will improve
Nth FP faction.
