That and its yet another "d00dsp34k" word.

Other ones I hate:

"Sup' dude" and  "wazzzup!" <<< I fucking hate that stupid commercial.

When people answer you with "k" instead of at least "ok."
I don't mind abbreviations to speed typing and communication
but come on people! Is the "O" really that far away from the "K"
on your keyboard?

I must admit I do like "WTF?" though. *shrug*
