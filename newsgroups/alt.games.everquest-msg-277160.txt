That's because your question gave no clue what your problem really
was.  No, none of us are having trouble casting Thunderclap.
Apparently, neither are you.  If you'd asked, "What is Thunderclap
supposed to do?", or even if you'd said, "When I cast Thunderclap,
there's no effect on my target", or anything else even vaguely
descriptive, maybe we'd have clued you in faster.  As it is, the
community here did manage to figure out your problem after a couple
iterations.

And that's the real problem with SOE CS, from the sound of it.  They
aren't prepared to engage in an actual dialog, so they have no chance
of figuring out what a player's real problem is if it's not presented
clearly and accurately in the original petition.  Combine that with a
tendency for CS reps to misinterpret even a clearly presented petition,
and it's a recipe for disaster.
