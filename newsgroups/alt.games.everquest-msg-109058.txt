Depends on the person.  Some people tend to think of themselves as the
character, in which case, that is definatly a point.  I tend to think of
myself as guiding the character (too many Princess Maker type game), which
is why I play female characters; it's easier for me to get attached to a
female character than a male one.  OTOH, others tend to look at it as just a
game.  I figure if it's worth playing at all, it's worth getting at least a
little attached to the game, though.

Perhaps, it may just be a catharsis for them.  Or they may not care one way
or another about good or evil acts in the game, only about efficiencies and
max output.  I believe the term for that type of player is "Halfling Druid."

I would say that in many cases, it means that it's poorly thought out.  That
seems to be changing, though.

I started fighting Aviaks, mainly becasue the Kaladim Cleric's guild wanted
me to, so I figure there's got to be some reason.  In the end, I gave up
mainly because I saw no reason to kill them.  I tend to shy away from
hunting sentient mobs without good reason.  Never killed a centaur, nor a
living froggie.  The only Dwarves who have fallen to my blade are the
bandits.

I almost stopped playing my paladin over that.  Beating on the clockworks
was a nuisance, but I don't think they're sentient.  The fairy maidens, OTOH
really disturbed me.  A high level rogue took pitty on me, however, and
pickpocked a few of them and gave me the dusts.  Not the best solution, but
one that I was grateful to have.

That, and I think alot of the wanna be l337-dud3z like playing the dark
characters.  I tend to be lawful good by nature, so I have a difficulty
playing anything farther away from me than neutral with a good streak.
That's the reason I don't like my necro.  Fun class, but I can't stand any
of the dieties.  Let me worship Rallos Zek, and I can deal with it.

I thought I was alone in this.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
