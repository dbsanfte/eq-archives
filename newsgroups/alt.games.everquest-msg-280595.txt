Having developed a new charm based killing tactic, I'm looking for 
places to deploy it.   Essentially, the idea is to find mobs who 
naturally hate each other, one of which doesn't hate me (a "guard"), and 
use that antipathy to get the killing done for me.

So, what I'm looking for from you people are suggestions of zones where 
this sort of thing exists, with sufficiently high level mobs to make the 
tactic worthwhile.  Proximity also helps, it won't be all that useful to 
have "guards" in one corner of the zone and the mobs they hate in the 
far corner.

I started in Neth Lair, but at 29 the mobs were in the green to barely 
dark blue range, good for experimenting, not good for really getting 
good use from the plan.

I'm working now in Great Divide, where the Coldain hate the Giants and 
their wolves (and vice versa, so if I was on the Giant team, I could use 
the plan in reverse)

42 suggested Echo Caverns; I'm not sure whether he means FG side or Deep 
  side, on the FG side I think the mobs are going to be too low for me 
at 30... but maybe not, I never really did much in Echo.

I recall in LOIO that the goblins hate the sarnaks... but lacking mem 
blur I don't think I can really use that to my advantage as boths sides 
hate me.

Where else?

Marus Seru guards will fight some of the mobs there and not others. 
Dawnshroud guards will fight some of the mobs and not others... how 
about the TM guards?  Vampires will be too high level for me to land 
charm on at the moment, but I'm looking down the road for future targets 
too.

Coldain guards in CC and in EW... I've run to coldain for rescue in both 
places, plus had a roaming coldain down at tentacles come and KS me, it 
would be good to put him to work!

More?
