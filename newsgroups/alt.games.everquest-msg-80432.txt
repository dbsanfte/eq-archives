I'm curious how he got sent to an island and killed by a cyclops?  There's
not a tp spot anywhere like that, that I"m aware of (40 wizzie here, with
other higher characters).  But, next time, you /petition the person.....and
/report playernamethatscrewedyouover  and it will copy the last 10 lines of
text, so be sure where your son said "I want to go to gfay" and they guy
said "sure" is in there..then when they see he ended up in say, EJ, he's got
the hard proof.  Still...not sure how he could have been tp'd to some
island??  Sure he just didn't take the boat to BB, got off at the island
there (sister or brother, don't remember which), and wandered around,
thinking it was BB?
