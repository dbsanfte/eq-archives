He didn't write to the head office, he sent an e-mail, probably to the
tech support queue. 
[We don't know for sure since all he said was "I sent an email".
Actually we don't even know if KDragon is a he.]

This is complicated by another factor.
Who is responsible for the GMs, NCPlay or Cryptic?

NCPlay does the tech support, and from the sounds of some of the replies
I'VE gotten, many of the tech support drones have never even seen the
game.

They get a "support call" that's complaining about kill stealing and a
GM's actions from someone who DOESN'T have an active account, they're
going to send the "sorry you're not a customer" form reply.

They don't get paid to provide support to non-customers and would
probably get in trouble if they did provide it.



Honestly though, KDragon is playing and getting Harrassed/Serial kill
stolen and petitions.
Tells the GM about kill stealing NOT THE HARRASSMENT of it being a
continuous thing and gets told "there is no kill stealing, you get exp
for damage you do" and immediately logs out and cancels.

You get an email that says "I was getting kill stealed.  I petitioned a
GM, he replied with "You have no reason to petition, you received some
xp", so I logged out and canceled my account."

What would you do in reply to that, even if he hadn't canceled?

He's complaining about Kill Stealing, something that policy says DOES
NOT EXIST in City of Heroes since you always get a share of xp if you
did any damage at all to the critter no matter who killed it.

If he'd complained about the harassment of this person following them
around and doing this repeatedly, things would have gone quite
differently, since Harassment isn't allowed.

Heh I noticed that myself.  Hint for everyone, it was KDragon who quit
and sent the email.
