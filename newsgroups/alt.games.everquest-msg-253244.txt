As others have mentioned in thread, it depends on how it is done.  If the
intent is to get free gear, or to have a chuckle over males getting flirty
with you, then yes that is sick.  I do think it possible to roleplay a
female toon with good intent.  But know the reality that 99% of those that
try to flirt are flirting with the person not the toon.  It is sick of you
to encourage or even allow it without telling them the truth of the
situation.
