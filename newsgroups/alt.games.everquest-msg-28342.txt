Half the server population that is.

As, according to all the best info, if it takes you X period of time to
get from 1-50, it will take you X to get from 50-60.  So the 50-60 count
should be = to 1-49 count.  Or if you toss out throw-aways, gimps,
beggars, and mules 50-60 count should = 10-49 count.
