It is.

Most do.   42's comment "plonk is telling someone your going to killfile
them then there is actually killfiling them"   is sort of a joke.   A
reference to the vast number of people who claim to killfile the person
they're arguing with, but don't actually do it.   Low willpower, want to see
the freak out over being ignored, etc...   It's almost common to see one
person announce "thats it, I'm plonking you!" and then continue the argument
the next day, responding to the same person.
