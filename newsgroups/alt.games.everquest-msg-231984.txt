Er...did I miss something here? 

He doesn't like Iksars. Big deal. 

His take on things is no worse than the OP's comments of: 

 "What isn it with Wood Elves that atracts the morons? And not just 1
or 2...I mean almost all." 

Combine this blatant & successful attempt at idiocy with the raving
"quit fucking stalking me" response to 42, its glaringly apparent you
need psychological help. 

Have you talked to your parents about your problem? They can get you
the therapy it seems you need.
