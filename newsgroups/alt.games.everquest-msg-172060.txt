Have you really led such a sheltered life?  If people can be that
stupid in RL, and some of them most definitely are, what's to stop
them from being the same in EQ?

I don't know that I've ever grouped with an incompetent Bard, while I've
seen plenty of idiots playing every other class (except BL, Khosh is the
only BL I've ever grouped with and I was amazed at how effective a BL
plus Warrior duo turned out to be, tho admittdly we were low level).
In caster heavy groups the Bards would always be singing at least one
manasong, two if we were actually forced to recuperate from a bad fight
or somesuch.  In melee heavy groups the Bards would sing manasong at the
healer whenever we were waiting on a pull, but otherwise be busy helping
the melees kill faster.  In an entertaining two group raid on Droga and
Nurga some while back the Bard was grouped with 4 Casters and a hybrid
(me) so he could just pump mana as fast and efficiently as possible
(when the fighting was easy, as it was in some parts of our crawl, he'd
move up and join in the fighting, but mostly he just pumped mana as
fast as he could).  In an ill-fated Hole raid (Ratman Guard for SK
epic).  The Bard we had was our CC, and she did a great job of mezing
the three adds on the pull.  Unfortunately a yellow to me (I was 50 at
the time) elemental popped in on us while we were fighting the (red to
me) Ratman Guard. I was down to about 40% health when somebody finally
got the elemental off my back, and was forced to use LH shortly after
that, but not soon enough to avoid learning the hard way what it's like
to be bounced like a pingpong ball between a couple of summonning mobs.
During the 40 seconds or so it took the mobs to drop me, other than my
own LH I received precisely one HoT from our two Clerics (L54 and L60).
Bah, I'm rambling again.
