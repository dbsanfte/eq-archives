Seriously, it IS on Test. It's supposed to go live tomorrow. See the details
here:
http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm11.showMessage?topicID=466.topic
And yes, it wraps. To go the long way, http://www.eqtraders.com and Message
Board, Quests Requiring Tradeskills, and then 8th Shawl live on Test.

bounce bounce bounce. Requires a LOT of smithing. Are you surprised? Of
course not. The leather padding needed is patch of Velium Hound fur + a
silver thread. And at last, a use for large blocks of Velium. And... they
need to be imbued with gems you polish yourself. (Combination fletching and
jewelry).
