Other than the fact that it's probably the most crowded of all the servers, 
it's working out well, about as much RP as I experienced on FV (which 
admitedly is not much). It has its share of wackos and dewds, but overall 
it's been a pretty typical EQ player population (however you care to 
interpret that).

No changes in the ruleset that I'm aware of, appears to be same as the 
others.
