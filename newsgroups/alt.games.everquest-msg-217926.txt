Since delay doesn't effect backstab, I don't think you can say
delay is the critically important thing for a rogue weapon.  In
fact, if anything you could say Damage is, since Damage does
affect BS damage; for other classes neither is the "most"
important thing.

Ignoring the BS angle, though, "effective damage ratio" would be
the real matter; a damage 1 delay 15 weapon would be inferior to
a damage 15 delay 16 weapon, for example.  I say "effective
ratio" because I understand you need to factor in your damage
bonus (that 1/15 weapon might really be sort of a 10/15... but
still worse than a 15/16 which is really a 25/16) and proc rate
(but proc rates vary from weapon to weapon, so the 16 delay
weapon might proc three times as often as the 15 delay one, or
half as often, depending on the weapon in question).  On the
other hand, I don't see how delay matters as far as double
attacks go; this should be directly proportional to ratio, double
attacking a little more often but for less damage is the same as
double attacking a little less often but for more damage.  The
only point where that matters is when trying to get skill ups,
where the raw number of attempts is the important thing, and in
that case the same will apply not just to double attack, but to
Attack skill and Piercing skill.  Still, its unlikely anyone high
enough level to worry about weapons like you are discussing is
having any trouble keeping the skills capped on his rogue.

Further, all things being equal, a weapon that hits less often
means less hate, so really the higher the delay the better, given
that rogues are a "please don't touch me there" class. 
Similarly, hitting less often means fewer ripostes (not that you
should be hitting from the front) and more importantly, less
damage from DS.  SO if you do the same amount of damage per
minute, doing it via a slower weapon is better for a rogue, not
worse.

Nothing to do with your discussion of LDoN and its relative
merits vis a vis raid quality gear, just saying.
