	Lanys T'vyl was the "child of Hate", the daughter of Innoruuk and an
(unspecified?) Teir'dal priestess.  She was created in direct response to
Tunare impregnating a Koada'dal noblewoman with Firiona Vie (Tunare took male
form for this...just, don't go there, OK?)

	Lanys served as leader of Innoruuk's forces at first, leading an attack on
Highpass (for no clear reason, since Carson McCabe is already working for the
Teir'dal).  The attack was routed by Firiona and her forces (some of them PCs,
this was played out as the 1999 Halloween event).  Lanys was saved from death
at Firiona's hands by her second-in-command, whose name escapes me but now
spawns as a mummy in Kithicor at night.  He used a powerful artifact to open
the portal to the Plane of Hate so Innoruuk could snatch Lanys away and deploy
his nuclear deterrent on the PCs.  (Really -- the event ended with a zone-wide
massive AE that killed everyone.  I had zoned out in disgust long before
that.)  This event marked the opening of the first version of Hate to PCs.

	When Lanys surfaced again she'd had some kind of falling out with Dad and
had turned free agent.  She was trying (IIRC) to secure her own goddesshood.
She started her own cult, Primordial Malice (a faction group that still exists
in game, AFAIK), caused a schism in Neriak (either the king or the queen
supported her while the other stayed loyal to Innoruuk, can't remember which
did which) and was eventually hunted down and killed by the loyal Teir'dal on
orders from Innoruuk.  The 2001 Halloween event involved her spirit making at
attempt to return to life, which I do not think was successful.

	It is said that the whole Lanys storyline was created by the GMs to derail
a complex and popular player-run "Daughter of Hate" storyline on Rallos Zek.
I have no idea how true that is.
