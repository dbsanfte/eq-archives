Hmmmm...a little idle musing....hope I don't derail your topic...

When I rewired my home 2 years ago, I ran pair of 20a lines into my computer room, and
another 20a line to my network cabinet.

Then I pulled at least 1 drop to every room, consisting of at least 2 CAT5E lines (1
ethernet, 1 voice) and a single RG-6 Quad Shield.

Some rooms got 2x RG-6 lines for my triple-LNB DBS system; the computer room got 4x CAT5E
(2x data, 1x voice plus a dedicated DSL circuit from my Keptel).  My whole-house DSL
filter lives in my Keptel, so I don't have to put a filter on every phone.

It all 'stars' out of the network cabinet in the laundry room, which features a couple of
66-pin punchblocks and a NetGear 16-port 100MB/s auto-sensing switch.  There is inline
surge protection for all inbound telco and RG-6 lines.

I might have gotten a little carried away.  :->

Best regards,
