Does anyone successfully run EQ on a Dell Inspiron 5000 Laptop without
PC hangs?  I was only getting hangs once every other evening (almost
bearable), but this week I'm getting several hangs an evening.  I have
a Dell i5000 with 256M of RAM, lots of free disk space, Windows 98SE,
and a cable connection beyond a 3com Ethernet card.

I suspect the video driver, DirectX, or EQ's use of DirectX because
the screen freezes and I can't even do a control-alt-delete.  I
noticed that my Ethernet card uses the same IRQ settings as the video
GPU, so that could be a factor as well.

If you play EQ on a Dell i5000 successfully with W98, please send me
an email with how you got it to work!
