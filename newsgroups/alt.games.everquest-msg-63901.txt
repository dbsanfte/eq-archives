Have been running a Celeron 400 FC-PGA at 606MHz with slight modifications..
installed a mediocre though funtional blow hole in the front of the PC as
well as a nice CFM throwing fan on the top of the case, then the retail
heatsink/fan combo replaced with a gold globe turbo sink/fan.  At the time I
purchased the gold globe for $20 I believe it was... the other two fans I
picked up at an electronics surplus store for maybe $5.00 each.  All in all,
when the 400 was purchased, I save atleast $100.00 after adding the fans if
not much more.  It has been awhile.  The FSB is running at 100MHz which is
fairly nice as well.
