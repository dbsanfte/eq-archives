A suggestion:

Go back to my website, hit the various pages, then get into your Temp
Internet Storage and pull out my webpages and my style sheet
(shaw.css).  I'm teaching myself HTML and so I tend to document
everything I've done in each page and in the style sheet.

When looking at other people's websites, it's astonishing that
absolutely nobody seems to use documentation.  I guess they're all
HTML geniuses.

Also, the constructor I'm using (HTML-Kit) has a code verifier (both
for HTML and style sheets) which I use to ensure no coding errors.
Always code to 0 errors AND 0 warnings.
