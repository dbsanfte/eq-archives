If the super computer is fast enough, then the overhead of emulation is 
absorbed and disappears. This is what happened when PPC repleaced the 
68k... the PPC processors were so much faster than the original CPUs 
that many applications actually ran faster emulated on the CPUs than 
they did on their native CPUs.
