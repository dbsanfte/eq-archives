I've downloaded the patches and and new patcher ready to have a look at EQ
again for when Luclin comes out, but when I try to select the accounts
screen to re-activate my account it freezes on "connecting to the login
server" unless I have disabled ZoneAlarm first.

Is there a particular keypress or routine to follow to get into the accounts
section with ZA enabled please?

Obviously if its just a problem with the accounts section then I can disable
ZA and re-enable it to play the game, but I fear the problem may affect
gameplay too. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.
