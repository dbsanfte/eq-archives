Well, proving *you* wrong is pretty trivial.  I don't have to
prove AI wrong because I didn't make any claims about any
specifics that AI wrote other than that it is not what you
said it was.  In particular, I didn't claim that AI is "bullshit."

So, let's review your claim.  You wrote:


>what about the murder of 1000+ palestinians under isreali 
>oppression that happened FIRST?!
>...
>my source?  Amnesty International.


The problem is not the claim that approximately 1000 Palestinians
have been killed, of which (as the AI article notes) an unknown 
number were noncombatants.  Your taste for hyperbole comes in 
with the claim that *all* of these killings were "murder," which
the AI report does not claim, and that the killings occured
"under isreali (sic) oppression that happened FIRST?!"

The AI article does not address what happened FIRST?!. The AI
article deals with concurrent killings by the Palestinians
and the Israelis.  In particular, the AI article notes that
the Israeli intrusions were *in response* to the Palestinian
killings and the second Intifada. 

Your claim that the killings described in the AI article occurred
FIRST?! is simply untrue.  Your claim that the AI article states
that all of the killings were "murder" is simply untrue.

Since my points were directed only at your use of AI
to make a false claim to authority, I will not address
your remaining claims about statements from various other
advocacy groups.
