Only not true for a mere handful of games worth playing.

I have never read a manual for Diablo II and I've spent countless hours of 
fun with that game. It's definitely not a "need" here. I did occasionally 
read ONLINE information, such as runewords and what equipment was best, 
what skills builds worked best, etc. But this junk wasn't in the flimsey 
manual that came with D2.

NWN, BG, probably needs a manual. However, I never read it, because I 
already had read and know the (A)D&D rules and I could learn the 
differences by trial and error. However, I think these games would be much 
better if they gave more of an in-game tutorial about the game system and 
how to play rather than relying on previous D&D knowledge from the player 
or putting the info in a manual. I haven't played that much of KotOR but 
from what I can tell most of the info in this game is in the on-screen 
help.

This is one of those "games" that's too complex for me to bother with.

I played AC without resorting to the manual. It was playable without it.

> Civilization

Manual was important here but should have had the information in-game and 
make use of tutorials.
