A lot more than I'm making as a full-time writer, certainly.

But it's not just writers. It's artists, and programmers, and systems
maintenance personnel, and testers, and game designers (a lot of good
writers are poor game designers, and vice versa). Remember, every new
thing added is one more thing to potentially break. Tools alone aren't
enough -- if they were, there'd be no "broken quests". (Far too many
to count in SWG, and I've encountered a few in EQ2)

As a side note, what happens when new servers are brought online? Do
they begin at the same stage in the story as the oldr servers, or do
they begin at the beginning?

One idea I had was a monthly 'quest tree', similair to what SWG
promised with their story arcs and never delivered (did they ever have
more than the first three "monthly" stories? I don't think so, but I
could be wrong.) So, in Month 1, the Gnolls and Goblins are at war
over the Fields Of Painful Mistery. Players can choose to kill either
gnolls, or goblins (or both, which is what most players will do). Each
side also has a "General", who is buried deep in some suitably nasty
dungeon. When he is killed, the arc is done on that server, and the
other side "wins". Territories held by, say, gnolls, are now held by
goblins. The total number of gnolls is dropped -- "gnoll refugees" and
"gnoll partisans" become rare spawns. 

However, this is server by server. Some servers have gnolls, some
goblins. But...each one of these spawns an additional quest -- say,
the gnolls are split into factions trying to find two great artifacts,
each of which will change the world in some different way. Whichever
is found first by players will stay out of the hands of the gnolls.
The goblins, meanwhile, are trying to conquer two different cities,
one of elves and one of halflings, but they will ultimately only win
one, depending on which the players defend best.

So, now we have four different setups. Repeat -- 8. Repeat -- 16.
Which quickly becomes more than can be reasonably expected. Hmm. If
you make the splits frequent enough to be interesting, you quickly run
into some seriously bad numbers. Uhm. Hell, if you made each arc six
months long, you'd still have 2^10 "worlds" after 5 years - 1,024
yettings. Even a 1-year arc would produce 32 different "worlds" after
5 years.

Gotta think about this more.
