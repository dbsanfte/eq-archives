I actually dueled someone last night. Two level 1 halflings with red
names, Knoobie and Newbtastik, were running around Rivervale begging
for pp, asking me "marryme plz sir?", complimenting me on my beard and
my 'dull swored' and my big muscles, calling me a pretty man and
telling me "I luv u more sir" and that I should be at home cooking.
Then they asked me to crush them. I challenged the first to a duel,
but he was already in one. Challenged the other, he accepted, I
whacked him for 17 points of damage (should have memmed up a nuke) and
ran for misty thicket with a ton of wimpy Rivervale guards after me :)
I never saw a death message, but when I came back, there was
Newbtastik's corpse and Knoobie telling me I had killed him and that
he cried, and shouting "U SIR ARE A SINNER!" and that I had to be at
least level 2 (after inspecting me) to the zone. As I was camping, I
got another duel challenge from Knoobie - tough luck.
A level 10 halfling warrior was also out to get them and tried
offering them 5 pp if they'd come to zone instead of just hanging out
in front of the bank, there were also people considering the
possibilities of root.
