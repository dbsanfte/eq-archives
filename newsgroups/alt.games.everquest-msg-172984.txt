Why?  I'm serious.  If the roles you are taking are those of the Three
Musketeers ("One for all and all for one!") then your statement makes
total sense.  But what of other roles?  To use EQ's backstory, why
would an Ogre Warrior follower of Rallos Zek, a DE Cleric follower of
Innoruuk, and an Iksar Shaman follower of the Cazic-Thule, who just
happened to have thrown their lot together for a brief while, show such
consideration for one another?  Were is the justification for it in a
role-playing context?  I think you're talking through your hat here,
projecting your twenty-first century sensibilities into an environment
where they are clearly an anachronism.

Sorry, but that statement is ridiculous and unsupportable, IMO.

Kaev <--- who almost always plays characters that are "nice guys"
almost all of the time, but can't for the life of him understand why
anybody would think that everybody has to play that way, ESPECIALLY
WHEN IT IS CONTRARY TO A ROLEPLAYING SPIRIT.
