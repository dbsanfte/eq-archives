Yeah I'd definately go with the GeForce4 128megs DDR. I haven't really
compared it myself but I hear anyone I talk to about it saying that
GeForce is the way to go. Everything else looks nice even though I'm
pretty hardware retarded I just purchased a new comp myself and that
looks pretty close to what I got. I hear AMD heats up pretty well
though if that makes a difference, I went with p4 2.4ghz. Though the
performance seems to be just by opinion so I'm guessing either will be
ok. Just get a case with a bunch of well manufactured fans. :p
