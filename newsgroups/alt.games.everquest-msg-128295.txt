   I don't see this as a drawback at all.  I imagine what the bazaar on the other
servers is like... packed wall to wall with selling mules, many of them no doubt
empty and neglected for days on end.  I feel safe saying that the lag isn't going to
be pleasant.  At least on FV the ones that would have a mule up will have to by a
second account, and a second box as well if they plan on leaving it up 24/7.
