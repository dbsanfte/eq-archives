Lol - that's an Uber High Level problem too :)

Several things to try

-Group with a good cleric + enchanter/shaman 
-Make sure any other tanks you group with are using taunt
-Work on getting your ac/hp up
-Stand as far back from the mob as you can whilst still hitting it
-Get your 2hb up - the faster hits of 1hb cause more agro
-In a few levels you'll be able to use your evade skill, i.e. stop
fighting, feign death, get bak up and start again. At least until you
get to around level 35 when you'll be cursing it again.

HTH
