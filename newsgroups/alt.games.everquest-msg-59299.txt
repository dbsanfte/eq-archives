Hmmm, if you're killing them before they can damage you maybe you need
to start pulling them 2 at a time so you spend less time waiting on
the pull.  I'm serious here.  It sounds like you've found mobs so easy
that waiting for more mobs is holding back your exp.  You might want
to get your butts to Velks Lab and do floor spiders if you're hunting
off hours then, a 51 warrior with a 49ish cleric can do pretty well
there, and you can almost alwasy get a clarity from a passing
enchanter.  A damage dealer (monk/rogue/ranger) or slower/cc'er
(chanter/bard/shammy) would turn you into a serious power trio there.
I was there for an hour today with 51 warrior and 53/4 cleric, and I
got over 1 blue bubble, so I assume you would have gotten about 2.5
bubbles and Tiru would have made almost a full yellow in that time
(assuming she's 50 now).  
Maybe I'm not familiar with OOT, but I doubt you can chain-pull easy
blues non-stop there.  Ohhh, and the cleric was dropping CHeals at
about 1 bubble of health, maybe a celestial if the warrior was below
1/2 at the end of the fight, just cause the little bastards backstab
and stun when you're pulling them back.
