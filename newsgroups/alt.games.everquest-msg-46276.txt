Has anyone done a matrix of what class\race\alignment matches there can
be?
I was thinking about trying to work it out so that I could have
suggestions for my play group. 
For example is there a race/alignment mix that allows a starting group
(e.g. common language) of CLE,WAR,DRU,ROG,MAG,ENC ?

Anyone ?
