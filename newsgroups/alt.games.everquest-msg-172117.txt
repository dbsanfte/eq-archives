Yeah I think you're right, especially since all three of them (as I just
dicovered) are AA abilities.  But I still don't understand why they'd put
them there.  Maybe the AA abilities give you a spell that could technically
be cast by a level 1.  Of course, that's a pointless distinction since the
only way the spell would get in your spellbook to be cast would be if you
were high enough lvl to get the AA points to buy it...
