I was in Echo Caverns yesterday, looking for new hunting grounds for a 
monk friend, and to my surprise, the mutants were amiable to me. I'm 
pretty sure the last time I was there (shortly after release) they were 
KOS, and I can't think what I could have done to make them like me. Not 
that I'm complaining... I like faction, and I like free faction even 
better. :)
