What's wrong, Inyidd? Was mommy's breast completely tapped out this
morning when you woke up and you had to drink cows milk instead?

And yes, it _is_ NET-S-CRAPE. It is a piece of shit, much like yourself,
which was made into even MORE shit when it was bought out by AOL (is
that your ISP too?) a couple years back.

Just because you are a nostalgia freak who wants to hold on to a failing
and old web browser doesn't mean you have to throw your little temper
tantrums in front of the rest of the class.

Cheers!

Ryan
