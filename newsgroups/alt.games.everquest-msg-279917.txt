Charisma DOES affect some spells however. It is apparently involved in 
making random duration charms stick longer (doesn't affect their resist 
rate, but helps reduce breaks), and it also provides a chance that a mob 
that resists a calm/lull/pacify spell won't attack you.

If your friend was an enchanter its probable that they've heard this, 
and are somewhat confused.
