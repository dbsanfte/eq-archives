As always, names of camps vary by server. My fav camp is NEB (Northeast 
basement).

*Most* of the top level mobs I've encountered don't see through invis. 
But as always, con everything, use the map, and a little paranoia goes a 
long way.

Ask where the camps are your server. The names WILL vary. Folks hunt in 
the hero shrines and the basements, as well as the graveyard.
