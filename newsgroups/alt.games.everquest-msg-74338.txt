Hm, what's trivial to a newbie character without main to twink him?
I can however see that it's not THAT hard to get 15 points in STA or
so (relatively cheap rings add a lot already). 

: My twinkie warrior uses a SoD in his primary hand.  Wanna know the
: difference between 140 DEX vs. 200+ DEX?  Jack and Shit.  Seriously, I

Maybe not 140 and 200. I dunno what is normal at the levels where I can
boost for melees DEX. If I can pump someone up from 120 to 255, I guess 
there is a difference. I also notice it helps speeding up learning
the skills quite a lot. At high elvel it's not THAT important as you
cover those 5 points of a new level fast.

: have no idea if or when my DEX is buffed or not since the proc rate
: difference is so minimal it's barely worth the mana.

Hm, my level 33 SK sees a big improvement in the proc of his
Doljon<whatever>molinar axe. I proc a lot more with the shammie DEX
buffs on. And with a 140 DD on that axe it makes for a lot of damage.

: Primal Avatar on the other hand, that's a damn fine buff...

For me, anyways :) Saves me a lot of work. But you didn't explain why.
Because of the ATK component? Everything else is just +100 to all
stats (which you don't seem to think is important). Or because it hits
AGI as well?

: Stat buffs, with the exception of STA lines, is largely a waste of
: mana.  Fortunately, most of the JB stuff have right click stat buffs
: so it keeps idiot meleers happy by tossing a buff icon on their
: screen.

Wouldn't call it idiot meleers. It does have an effect. Maybe it depends
on the weapon, your exactl stat values etc. You'd have to know the
exact internal game engine works to really answer that. Seems like it
has more effect to some than others.

: The REAL reasons why shamans are more useful vs. druids are Slow and
: Haste.

I'd call these the biggest ones as well. And PLing. My warrior is at
level 13, and hell, do the level 53 buffs help. Madly so. The stat
buffs help my skill advancement fly, the HP buff at this level is
uber (ok, not as uber as a clerics), and with chloro, you don't die
with 6 mobs whacking you :P

: Even the lack of snare is addressed by the SK's darkness lines.

Didn't quite follow you here on the subject change.
