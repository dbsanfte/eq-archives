Remember crafting is a money sink so on your first character it is better 
not to get too carried away with crafting until you gety established.

Just save your cp and when you drop by town check out the broker to see what 
is for sale. I was able to equip my rogue very well for it's level for the 
princley sum of 12 silver peices which I had saved from my time on the isle 
of refuge.
