Kinda off subject BUT;

To all you quad kiting druids.....do you find it nessary to run yor
kites all over other people? I am SO tired of your crap...I will be
soloing in CS and some druid runs his quad right over me and my solo,
and his quad decides to jump me. If you cant controll your quads, get
out.

And to those that think its funny......got a nice supprise for ya next
time......it would be a shame if your snare's wore off early :)
