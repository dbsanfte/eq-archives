With maxed conjuration, the familiar summon still fizzles twice as
often as any other spell.  Further, there are no cheap ways for
a wizard to practice conjuration, as I understand it, so maxing it
out is similar to maxing out

You are asking the wizard to sacrifice ten minutes of his time to save
you from looking at the floor.. only frankly you are going to have
to look at the floor anyway.  There are four hundred people in
the zone!  Sure it would be a little easier if none of them had
pets, but what are we talking, four pets on average?  And this isn't a zone
wide problem, the issue is really only if you happen to be looking
in the direction of the familiar.  So most of the time you get nothing
and occaisionally its as though there is one more person in the
zone.

Note that I'm not a wizard.  Don't play one, never have.  And
I'm on a dial up 56k modem.  But I don't begrudge the wizards
one of the perks of their class, which is that their familiars are
persistent, don't die when you zone like necro and mage (and chanter
and druid and cleric and shaman and SK) pets, and aren't
utterly useless after zoning like beastlord pets.  Damn hard
to summon, and very mana intensive, but once you get them up
you can keep em as long as you stay online.  Telling them you
are going to kill them every time they go to the bazaar is a pretty
serious nerf, particularly when you consider they are probably
the class best suited to use the bazaar on a casual basis.

Its not me, I'm not a wizard.  Thus it is considerate of me, yes.
Perhaps you are being selfish here, rather than me?  Its something
to think about.
