Verant isn't punishing anyone.  Everyone will continue to level AT LEAST
AS FAST as they have before.  They are removing the experience penalty
that certain classes were saddled with, and increasing grouping bonus.
This game is designed around grouping, though you can certainly solo if
you like.  However, it is a grouping based game and Verant has taken what
I believe to be very positive steps to encourage grouping.  (A side
benefit is that it will encourage more people to group, which should open
up some of the mind-numbingly boring single spawns that wimpy, no cohones
soloers are so fond of.  Now you won't have to wait 2 hours to have your
chance to kill something 8 levels below you once every 18 minutes.)
