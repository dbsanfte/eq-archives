Ah, to heck with it. It's still possible to retain an air of cool,
intellectual ascendancy and enjoy a base giggle too.

For a long time, necromancers have had the reputation as the ultimate
in evil professions.  They consort with dark powers, torture the
living, and enslave the dead.  They even use strange vampiric powers
to suck the life force right out of another person.  The epitome of
pure evil, right?

Not so fast.  When you look at the true picture, you see something
vastly different.  Necromancers aren't the true evil in this world -
Enchanters are.

Lets look at some examples of evil-doing by necromancers, and see the
myriad of ways that enchanters outdo them.

First, there's the pet thing.  Necromancers, the grubby little
bastards, will gleefully pull your dear old Uncle Fred out of the
grave and turn him into their everlasting slave.  But really, Uncle
Fred wasn't busy right then, and might appreciate the chance to walk
around a little and get some exercise.

Meanwhile, the innocent enchanter in the corner charms you, and has
you methodically slaughter the rest of the family. And the neighbors.
And maybe even little Timmy down the street.  And then, to put the
evil little cherry on top, the enchanter will wait for the charm to
drop, watch the horrified expression cross your face as you realize
what you've done, and then kill you.

Second, damage spells.  Here the necromancer has a wide variety of
ways to kill you.  He can infect you with a disease, poison you, cause
your blood to heat up, mess with your heart, and even turn you into a
skeleton.  None of these are a particularly pleasant way to die,
certainly much worse than getting incinerated by a mage or frozen by a
wizard.

But the enchanter is no slouch in the agonizing death department,
either.  He's got two main attack forms.  The first is to choke you to
death, slowly and agonizingly (think Darth Vadar in the beginning of
Star Wars).  The second is to fire a bolt of pure energy into your
target's brain, causing blinding spikes of pain to flare throughout
the victim.  And then, the enchanter waits for the pain to almost
completely abate, and the poor victim to believe they're free of the
torture, before he/she fires off another bolt of agonizing energy
(think the Emperor at the end of Return of the Jedi).

Third, the Vampirism issue.  True, necromancers have a wide variety of
spells that steal their victim's health or energy and give them to the
caster.  But this is counterbalanced by the wide variety of spells
they have to give their very own vital health and energy to other
people.

Meanwhile the enchanter also has spells to drain others of energy.
However, unlike the necromancer's eco-friendly spells, the enchanter
carelessly disregards the energy he siphons.  This uncontrolled energy
release straight into the environment is clearly the cause of the
environmental shifts seen recently in Norrath, particularly the
rainfall in the deserts and the increased fog banks.

Fourth, the "consorting with dark powers" accusation.  This is a PR
issue for necromancers.  I mean, calling a spell dark pact has
negative connotations while calling the same basic spell, say,
cannibalize doesn't.  Or calling a spell snare instead of clinging
darkness.  If the necromancers would pony up some of that hard earned
loot for a good PR firm, this problem could be fixed in a heartbeat.
Unfortunately, the average necromancer is too much of a loner to work
well in a group fix this issue.

Now we get to some of the real evil that enchanters do.  It starts
with the illusions.  Who wants a grubby little high elf peasant scum
to visit their home in the better parts of Neriak?  Spying on them,
chatting up their friends, and generally making a nuisance of
themselves.  Keeping the high elf riffraff out is, after all, what we
pay the guards to do. But the illusions render our poor, underpaid
guards incapable of doing their job and keeping the lower classes in
their proper place.

Last but certainly not least, is the most insidiously evil set of
spells the enchanter has at his/her disposal.  I refer, of course, to
the mind-altering spells.  These come in two basic forms, the "memory
wipe" and the "attitude adjustment".  The memory wipe will allow the
enchanter to erase the memory of all of the pain and suffering they
have caused you, usually so they can do it again and a later date.
The attitude adjustment, actually a sophisticated form of
brainwashing, will cause you to be aware of the enchanter's action,
but to rationalize them away. (Little Timmy was rude. He deserved to
be slaughtered.)

Now you realize the true depths of the enchanter's evil.  Of course,
is doesn't really matter, as the Attitude Adjustment Team will be
knocking on your door shortly, and you won't remember a word of this
essay, except that enchanters are the best thing to ever happen to
Norrath.

And a couple more for luck:

>>>

((You drift off to sleep while playing EQ))

 Suddenly you snap awake and instead of seeing your naked character at
 your bind point (where you expected to be).. you notice that the
 landscape has changed and you are surrounded by hordes of all the mean
 nasties you have tried so hard to eradicate from the face of Norrath.
 You even see some creatures for the first time that you thought were
 only legends or were total myths. Luckily, they are not looking at
 you. Strangely, they do not even notice that you are standing there
 among them. You start to catch fragments of what is being said in the
 chat box....

 A cleric of Innourok says: Listen, you told me you were going to meet
 me there and you didn't show. I died because you were not there, at
 least you could have sent me a tell letting me know you were going to
 be late.

 Maestro of Rancor says: Hey, I had my own problem ok? I had a train
 like you would not believe and I could not slash myself to get away
 until right at the end, they almost got me!

 Lady Vox says: You better find another way to get away, they are
 nerfing it so you can't do that anymore.

 Avatar of Fear says: Heh, just be lucky you guys are tucked away. I
 can't even get in because the damn Mobs are at sitting right on top of
 where I camped. Every time I try and log in I get ganked. I have
 tried reporting them to the GMs but all I get is the "There is nothing
 I can do at this time sorry" answer.. sheesh.

 a orc warrior says: what you guys need to do is to roam around a bit
 more and use better tactics. I can't tell you how many times I'll
 watch some little
 green ranger or some other little thing come by and grab my little
 brothers one by one and I just quietly wait for them and as soon as I
 can get a couple of my cleric buddies, I just drop on over and take
 them out! hehe !!!!

 Lady Vox says: STFU you newbie, you have no clue what you are talking
 about.

 a orc warrior says: bite me you big lizard.

 Lady Vox bites a orc warrior for 200 points of damage!

 a orc warrior has been slain by Lady Vox!

 Lady Vox has defeated a orc warrior in a duel to the death!

 Lady Vox says: sheesh I hate loudmouths.

 a festering hag says out of character: When is this meeting going to
 happen?

 a wan ghoul wizard says out of character: Shut up you hag! hehe

 a festering hag says out of character:Keep it up and I'll report you
 freak.

 Ghoul Messenger auctions Looking for a SoW!! Will pay.

 Aradune Broadcasts: Ok, the meeting is about to begin, everyone that
 can, please come to the designated spot and I will be right there.

 a festering hag begins to cast a spell

 Aradune says: Ok, well, I called you all here to get an idea of how we
 are doing so far. We have taken care of some of the bugs that you have
 reported to us and for that, we thank you. I would really like to
 recognize Lady Vox who after much research was able to help us figure
 out that her see invis spell was truly broken and not working. Sorry
 about that Voxxie. And I would like to thank you all for pointing out
 that those Life tap line of spells were not getting resisted at all.
 Thanks for that, we fixed it now.

 a hill giant says: Thanks Aradune, you rock!

 Lady Vox says:It is ok, it is fixed now and I am able to see those lil
 naked guys running around now.

 Aradune says: ok, now, on to things at hand. We are getting reports
 that there are some that are having technical problems getting in to
 play, would anyone like to give me an idea and maybe some data so we
 can get to the bottom of this?

 a glacial ice bear says: Well, there seems to be a lot of us that
 cannot zone into some areas and the server keeps kicking us out when
 we try. I know that I can only get in about once every 8 hours if I am
 lucky.

 Zahal the vile says: Same here, I have not been able to get in for
 over 3 weeks now, this is getting ridiculous. My friends Gull, Bilge,
 and Sludge are having the same problem. Sludge can get in sometimes,
 but he is stuck until he gets attacked (which I think is an exploit)

 Aradune says: What? Exploit? what are you talking about?

 Zahal the Vile says: well, whenever Sludge logs in, he is stuck
 underwater in this tiny well. He cannot move unless someone hits him
 with some kind of spell or weapon. Not sure why, but it happens every
 time.

 Aradune says: ok, we will look into it.

 a Griffon says: Um, I have another question about DoTs and moving ad
 such..

 Aradune says: one sec Griff, need to get the floor cleared of the bugs
 first.

 a Griffon says: ok.. np..

 Aradune says: ok, so no other problems?

 an evil eye says: Well there is still the problem of mobs camping our
 bind points, are you going to do anything about that?

 Aradune says: well, we are working on that..

 Aradune says: anything else?

 a sand giant says: Well, it is not really a big deal, but there are
 those of us that would like to be able to run a bit faster, I am tired
 of having to hit little weak greenies when the ones I really want just
 take off and outrun me.

 Aradune says: It is balance big guy, you are a fighter, you are
 supposed to hit and hit hard, not to be fast and nimble.

 a sand giant says: Well, it still sux..

 Chief Goonda says: Just come over here and I will SoW ya and you can
 run them down.

 a hill giant say: no, he has to stay in his area, he won't let us come
 to Oasis, so he can stay there killing the good stuff and we will stay
 in the Karanas.

 Chief Goonda says: Sorry m8te.. you heard the guy.

 Aradune says: Ok, well, if there are nothing else, we will meet back
 here next week and see what the changes that are in this next patch
 will bring. Take care all and thanks for playing.

 (( the crowd slowly breaks up, those that can evac and tele start to
 pop out and you see several shouts and auctions for teleports and SoWs
 to get them back to their areas. A quick /who shows the zone to
 contain only you and Aradune now. You turn to see him starting to
 slowly turn towards you and suddenly his sword replaces the book that
 was in his hand and you see him start to run towards you... He knows
 you are not supposed to be there, he knows you heard everything.....))

DELUXE ENCHANTER PETS (can't remember which ezboard)

posted by Rhavina December 08, 2000 10:22 AM 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
While it is asserted by some that Magicians are masters of the
summoned pet I am here to dispute such rubbish. It should be obvious
to anyone that Enchanters have the best pets. "Scoff, scoff" you say?
You think our animations are puny, stupid and lack the scintillating
conversation offered by other casters� pets? If I were speaking of the
default Enchanter pet line, the (insert lame anagram-created name
here)'s Animation, you would be correct. However, we have a deluxe
line of enchanter pets that people seem to forget about, each with
their own strengths and weaknesses. One immediate advantage you'll
note is that we can have up to five pets at a time. Let us examine
each in turn:

Warrior
Components Needed: Celerity and an alcoholic beverage or promise of
lots of shiny metal objects.
Pros: Strong attack/defense, it will usually last long enough for you
to zone or gate to safety.
Cons: A tendency to get you trained by mobs, Auto-Attack always seems
to be on, "/Pet Back Off" command appears to be bugged.
The toughest of our pet line but often the most troublesome. The
warrior pet comes in many shapes and sizes. I prefer the barbarian
warrior pet combo. With a warrior pet it�s generally best to just turn
them loose and stand back. They ignore most commands and tend to pull
when you're least ready. Hearty, strong, and stupid (but within
acceptable limits), the warrior is best used in dungeons and other
tight fighting spots. Make sure you stand upwind of it though. 

Ranger
Components Needed: Clarity and words of encouragement, or free rezzes.
Pros: Nice multipurpose pet; can track, forage, and cast spells, some
fighting ability.
Cons: Tends to die a lot, poor self image.
Great for outdoor hunting if you can't manage to summon a druid pet.
The ranger pet is good for quests. It is excellent at locating that
rare spawn. Like following a bloodhound without any depth perception
you'll go careening all over the zone, often passing much more
interesting spawns, but eventually you will run your quarry to
ground...unless it de-spawns in the meantime. 

Paladin
Components Needed: Clarity and tell it you're on a mission from the
gods.
Pros: Decent fighting ability, great one shot heal, very
self-sacrificial.
Cons: Holier than thou.
The paladin is great for those areas where you need to burn a pet to
achieve your ends, such as holding off a group of berserk undead while
you loot that special spawn and gate to safety. Also useful for
purchasing things and turning in quest items in those good cities
where you've "accidently" killed one too many
sacred fish or annoying halflings.

Shadowknight
Components Needed: Clarity and save it from villagers with pitchforks
and torches.
Pro: Decent fighting ability, nasty one shot DD, can summon its own
pet, few if any ethical hangups.
Cons: Will sell you out to villagers with pitchforks and torches, few
if any ethical hangups.
The shadowknight pet is the very definition of a double-edged sword.
Handy in a fight and utterly ruthless, it may trip you up trying to
elbow its way out the door to the zone exit. Their best use is for
activities too repulsive for paladins but too tough for rangers. Never
turn your back on it.

Bards
Components Needed: An audience.
Pros: Mana song make Enchanters feel like they have Clarity.
Cons: It's a bard.
The bard pet is mostly useful for enhancing other pets. Otherwise they
run too fast, tend to aggro everything in hearing range and clutter up
your text buffer.

Rogues
Components Needed: It will choose it own components.
Pros: Able to enter wretched hives of scum and villainy (Felwithe,
Rivervale, etc.).
Cons: Have an aggressive form of "/autosplit others".
The Rogue pet is your ultimate stealth pet. When you need to get into
and out of hostile territory without having your pet aggro everything
in sight, summon a rogue. They seldom cause trains and gods save any
mob that turns its back on a rogue pet to smash your beautiful face.
It is generally unwise to accept food or drink from rogue pets.

Necromancers
Components Needed: Phat l00t.
Pros: Just ask, they'll tell you about them for hours.
Cons: Talk in an arcane argot called d00dspeak (and you thought gnoll
was bad).
One of the most powerful pets available to you but also the hardest to
summon. The necromancer pet is virtually self-sufficient to the point
of not even needing you. Use this pet to kill other people's pets,
break spawns or make you feel really inadequate. They may challenge
you to a duel, sometimes even during a pull.

Wizards
Components Needed: Clarity and flammable targets.
Pros: Your own personal nuclear arsenal.
Cons: Fragile, they make rangers seem robust.
If you like quick brutal fights with long down times then the wizard
pet is for you. Best for eliminating that singular uber-mob in a loud,
colorful fashion, the wizard pet is a self driven auto-cannon with
fire-and-forget capability. They are death
machines right up until a mob actually gets close enough to lay
hands/claws/fangs upon it or they go "oom". Then wizards tend to die.
Fast. They also make great taxis.

Magicians
Components Needed: Clarity and patience.
Pros: Wal-Mart in a robe.
Cons: Slow recast time after link death.
While the magician pet can summon additional "lesser" pets and deal
out direct damage spells, perhaps its best use is as your own private
supply wagon. Need food and drink? The mage summons it. Need more
bandages? Tap the mage. Magic weapons for newbie pets? You know who.
It is best if you allow your magician pet to summon an elemental pet
as this will extend its lifespan by an order of magnitude. Besides the
mob will then have to chew through two pets to get to you.

Druid
Components Needed: Clarity and a donation to Green Peace.
Pros: As ranger without actually being a ranger.
Cons: Fleas.
The druid pet is "the" outdoors specialist. Curiously, a druid pet
fights best while running away which is a tactic that takes a little
getting use to. Not recommended for Enchanters with heart or lung
problems. The druid is marvelously self-sufficient but not as
annoyingly so as the necromancer. They are also great for travel. Need
to get to some godsforsaken spot on Norrath? There is probably a druid
ring within a zone or two of it. A word of caution, if you enjoy
killing bears, wolves, and treants then letting a druid transport you
can turn into a one-way trip.

Shaman
Components Needed: Clarity and a donation to the "magical herb fund".
Pros: They're not bards.
Cons: Always pawing through something's entrails trying to divine
lotto numbers.
The shaman pet is the pet you summon to enhance other pets. A shaman
excels at making your other pets stronger, faster and tougher. It can
also cast some offensive spells and even fight if pressed. And it does
it without being a bard. It also can create potions that duplicate the
more useful spells or just see and hear cool colors. Be watchful of
their pets as they may try to bury your wand or rod in the backyard.

Cleric
Components Needed: Clarity and a donation to the local temple. 
Pros: Your own personal M*A*S*H.
Cons: Chance of a jihad.
The cleric pet is another great support pet. It has incredible healing
abilities and can generally cure all that ails you. A good choice when
you're going after undead or attacking a leper colony. When summoning
a cleric pet one should be mindful of which god the cleric pet
represents as this can make the difference between receiving the
blessings of a higher power or eternal damnation or both.

Monk
Components Need: Celerity and seven divine truths.
Pros: Low maintenance, self repairing.
Cons: Has a tendency to faint during bad pulls.
The monk pet is ideal for Enchanters who travel light. One seldom has
to equip a monk pet and it will actually complain if you give it too
much coin. For the quick, surgical strike summon a monk pet. The monk
is also extremely handy if you need wooden boards or bricks cut in
two.

Come on, you know its more like this :-

do not console him.

The necromancer is not allowed to share his ice cream or sauce with
anybody else.  He cites that as proof he NEEDS more than anyone else.
The other kids don't particularly like the necromancer, but who can
blame them?

The wizard is given a big scoop of what he believes to be the most
popular flavor of ice cream.  He is also given a little cart so he can
show off his bowl to everyone else, whether they like it or not.  He
eventually realizes, that not only is the flavor not particularly
popular, but neither is he.  Other kids just use him to get a ride in
his cart.  To top it off, he has less ice cream than anybody else.

The shaman get a normal size scoop of vanilla, and three big scoops of
different flavors.  One day the ice cream man changes one flavor to
something slightly different.  Some shamans like it, some do not.
Shamans get a lot of sauces, too.  Other kids think they don't get
enough of the most important sauce.  They are wrong.

Druids (there is always more than one) are given four scoops, but they
are all half-sized.  Most never notice they have less ice cream than
the shaman until until they are done eating and the shaman is still
munching away. When the ice cream man swaps out one of their flavors,
though, they all scream bitterly. Druids get some nice sauces, and they
get the wizard's cart, too.  Everyone hates druids.

The magician gets a big scoop of vanilla, a normal scoop of one of the
druid's flavors, one small scoop of the wizard's flavor and a ball of
rice, but he doesn't complain despite no toppings of any kind. The
magician doesn't really want the ball of rice, but is constantly begged
by the necromancer and younger kids to share it.  One day, the ice
cream man decides this is unappealing, and gives the magician an even
bigger ball of rice.  The magician still doesn't complain.  Eventually,
the ice cream man gives the magician a topping and a larger scoop of
vanilla.  The magician gets to keep the enormous ball of rice.

The enchanter gets his pick of ice cream and all but one of the most
popular sauces.  How many picks he gets to make is determined by an IQ
test.  In any case, he can only have a small scoop of vanilla, and to
eat it he has to get a swat on the head first.  If they stick with it
long enough, enchanters get exclusive access to the most popular
sauce.  Almost everyone but warriors and older necromancers plead
constantly for him to share the special sauce.

Bards are given a small scoop of vanilla and up to six scoops of any
one other flavor they choose, but they have to give away all but one of
these special scoops.  This makes them sort of popular, but if they
give away too much of certain flavors the ice cream man beats them
senseless.

The warrior gets a huge scoop of vanilla.  Its almost as big as any
three normal scoops of ice cream.  But the warrior doesn't understand
that.  He wants at least two scoops that size, and would still feel
cheated because all the casters get at least three scoops.  He also
wants sauce and other flavors of ice cream too.  The ice cream man
makes his scoop a little bigger, and gives him some spinkles.  The
warrior is sullen.

The ranger gets a big heaping mass of vanilla, but not quite as big as
the warrior's.  He also gets a nice selection of sauces, and some tiny
spoonfulls of the druid flavors of ice cream.  When new sauces are
introduced, the ranger generally gets first dibs.  He pretty much
agrees with the warrior about how unjust the ice cream man is.

The Paladin is given a smaller serving of vanilla than the ranger.  He
also gets a lot of the most popular sauce.  He grumbles about the ice
cream man more than anyone, because paladins are supposed to have the
most ice cream AND sauce.

Rangers and Paladins are both told to eat their ice cream from a bowl,
but using a fork instead of a spoon.

The Monk is given an enormous portion of vanilla, one of the largest
servings of ice cream in the game.  But its served to him in a cracked
cone instead of a bowl.  If he doesn't eat it just right, most of it
will melt.  He also gets sprinkles.  Eventually, the ice cream man
takes away half the sprinkles.

The Shadowknight is given a slighly smaller vanilla scoop than the
Paladin.  He also gets one tiny nibbit of each of the necromancer's
scoops.  He is told that because he gets FIVE scoops, more than anyone
else, he must eat his ice cream from a dog dish without any
silverware.  He gets no sauce.  Shadowknights complain a lot, and
everyone feels sorry for them.

The rogue is given an enormous portion of chocolate ice cream.  Like
the monk, it is in a cone instead of a bowl.  That's not what bothers
the rogue.  The rogue is ticked because he wanted milk chocolate, not
chocolate ice cream.  He usually throws his cone away.

The cleric is given several tiny scoops of ice cream and lots and lots
of a very popular sauce.  He is expected to dish out this sauce to
anyone who asks.  If he tries to eat his ice cream, other kids yell
that he doesn't know how to be a cleric.  Clerics who want to eat ice
cream instead of giving other kids their sauce have to eat alone.  A
lot of the other kids complain there are never any clerics around.
They refuse offers from shamans and druids for the same sauce, because
they think it tastes better when a cleric dishes it out.

Immanuel Kant was a real pissant
Who was very rarely stable.
Heidegger, Heidegger was a boozy beggar
Who could think you under the table.
David Hume could out-consume
Schopenhauer and Hegel,
And Wittgenstein was a beery swine
Who was just as schloshed as Schlegel.
There's nothing Nietzsche couldn't teach ya
'Bout the raising of the wrist.

John Stuart Mill, of his own free will,
On half a pint of shandy was particularly ill.
Plato, they say, could stick it away
Half a crate of whiskey every day.
Aristotle, Aristotle was a bugger for the bottle,
Hobbes was fond of his dram,
And Rene Descartes was a drunken fart:
"I drink, therefore I am"
Yes, Socrates, himself, is particularly missed;
A lovely little thinker but a bugger when he's pissed!
