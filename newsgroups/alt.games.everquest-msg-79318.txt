> TRAIN THAT WAS CAUSED BY YOU:

The other night in FM I got lost. I had on SOW and Levitate (druids are 
*so* spoiled ;) and I was wandering around. By the time I hit the zone I 
had approximately 12 giants, 4 or 5 burynai, and a couple of gorgin brutes 
on my ass. It was funny to watch them all chugging along after me :)

> TRAIN THAT YOU PERSONALLY WITNESSED IN GAME:

The other night I saw a train of (no joke) around 40 mobs in WC. SOmeone 
was training (get this) "For fun". Unfortunately, they chose to derail the 
train at the druid ring.
