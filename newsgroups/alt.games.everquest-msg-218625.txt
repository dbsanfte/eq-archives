Then why did you say it?  One of those types that just HAS to get the
last word in, aren't ya?  Well, I'll give you your petty little
"victory".  Have at it.

Regarding your careful analysis...  If you followed my original post,
this was clearly in regards to Rujarkian and my need to get points in
that dungeon only until I get Bane.  This is not a general description
of my playstyle, as I have always given of myself to help others. If
the group then wants another dungeon after, I always go.  After I'm
done with Ruj, it'll be Miragul as my prefered dungeon.  One can't
have a preference and stick to it?

However, you dEwDsPeaK in my group... ya will die.  =:-D
