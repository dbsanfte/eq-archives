My experience in BoT tells me that they can't get a group on their
own, so just invite whoever is around.  Most often if I accept, it's
just that person and I...  which could mean another 30 minutes of
group building whereas I could have gotten into a functioning group on
my own much faster.  Often it's a class or person that has trouble
getting a group for a REASON...  I've found such rudeness also extends
to their style of gameplay.

Another pet peeve, and probably the same type of player, is when a
person overinvites people via tells and when you get to them, they say
they are full.  It's obvious that for them all that matters is they
fill the group up fast.  Last night I found out this idiot invited 2
other shamen at the same time he invited me, never telling any of us
he had the slot full until we sent multiple unanswered /tells.

Should I apologize for expecting courtesy and intelligence from
people?
