Yup, that's the exit/entrance I was talking about. I can only guess
that the guards and Nocla Saah had been killed, and hadn't respawned
yet, because I sure didn't see them when I entered the newbie hunting
grounds. Then when I went to leave, I conned them (fortunately) and
saw they were ready to attack.

Fortunately, someone came by and gave me invis so I was able to walk
right in between them. I guess my question is if these guards are
ready to attack, will the residents of Paineel also be ready to
attack? Now that I know I don't have to enter the newbie hunting
grounds to enter Paineel, I might want to visit the city.
