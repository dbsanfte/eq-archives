What do people think of this?  More "dumbing down?" or a great idea?
I see a lot of ppl that leave corpses lying around with vendor trash etc on
them..... this'll learn 'em when the go to the GY zone and have 500 corpses
to loot!!

March and Beyond
Upcoming for March and April 2004
Graveyard Zone
Tired of losing your corpse?  The current EQ system removes corpses from the
game after a week to reduce clutter and potential video lag.  But we know
there are times when your character dies and you just can't get it right
away.  Next thing you know a day turns into a week and BAM!  Your corpse is
gone.  Since we can't leave the corpses sitting in game indefinitely, some
inventive folks here have come up with another option.
We plan to create a "graveyard" zone that will only work if your corpse has
decayed and disappeared.  If you have lost your corpse due to decay in other
parts of Norrath, you will be allowed to enter this zone and reclaim it.
This is just one of the things slated to come out of the EQ Live laboratory.
Watch for other exciting announcements in the weeks ahead.
