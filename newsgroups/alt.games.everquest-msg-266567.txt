Part of the problem i found with being a high level druid was that
everything bar healing seemed to be discarded by the game designers; in the
old world and older zones, snare and root etc worked; the newer the zone
however, the higher the resists (i recall being slaughtered by a light blue
mob in OOW which procced for 450, ran at sow speed and resisted the 3 snares
i could cast before going down in a gooey mess).

I found being a weak imitation cleric boring. High level grouping meant my
buffs were irrelevant (people always had better than my skins, usually had
better strength buffs, sow was irrelevant, you had to sit on a horse so the
wolf/tree forms and forage (things which i felt were fundamental to
druidness) were out, the fights tended to be against single critters and go
fast so the thorns weren't really useful)... sure, i could evac, but most of
the things which had made me feel distinct were disabled by the game
designers so healing was the only thing *left*.

Also as a matter of bad design, people's mana pools kept increasing in size
but mana regen didn't so there was strong pressure to cheat and buy flowing
thought items to keep up with other people. I'm hoping eq2 doesn't suffer
from mudflation as much, gives people decent no-drop questable gear at all
levels and don't create a situation like with the horses that even low level
people start feeling they have to have to keep up with others, and which
they can only obtain either by heavy twinking , mindless grinding (never
again!), or cheating.
