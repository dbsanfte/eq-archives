I'm not a hardcore everquest player. I have been playing for almost a 
year and i have just gotten my main to 46 and my highest alt is 34. I 
got the Sebilis key today with the help of a guildie on my shaman and 
she showed me where the zone in is. I poped down there to check it out 
and it said it was added to my keyring. What is this keyring? Do i still 
need the physical key? or can i enter at my own free will now without 
holding the key on my person? Also what comands are there for the "keyring"?
