There's a big difference between being reimbursed for reagents used during
the course of a group and wanting ingredients for working on trade skills
later. I don't see anything wrong with people wanting to pay fair market
value for items that drop rather than selling them to a vendor. It might be
a pain for the master looter but then perhaps the people interested in the
common tradeskill items should be the looter.

The LDoN smithing ingredients are always split in the groups I do. Since
they sell for about 150pp @ on my server, they're often worth more than what
the rest of what the split was. Also sometimes you get the spell research
ingredients that are worth much more than any pp you'd get from a split, you
just need someone sharp enough on the market value of the items to point
that out.

It's become expected that clerics buff with their buffs regardless of the
cost. It's also become accepted that clerics get reimbursed prior to the
split by the majority of players. I've never been in a group with player
that complained about it and I wouldn't ever group again with people that
did complain.
