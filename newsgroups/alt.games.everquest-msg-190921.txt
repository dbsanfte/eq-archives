I so miss the very early days of EQ for this reason.  My
bard was still in a mixture of patchwork/rawhide/leather at
level 14.  At 16 I took the 125pp or so I'd scrounged up
and purchased most of a suit of banded, a dwarven axe and
a dragoon dirk.  When the dirk first started dropping it
was a 100% drop in CB, so they were VERY cheap, considering
they were better than a well balanced rapier (the best
known piercing weapon at the time).  Heh, I felt MIGHTY.
