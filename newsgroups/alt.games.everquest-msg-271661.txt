> Anyone have a nice list of EQ2 sites out there

My favorite is http://www.gry-online.pl/eq2/maps.asp  It's a great map site 
(much better than gamer god) and has a lot of quest/NPC info.

http://allakhazam.com is ok too.  For crafting, eqtraders.com has a section 
for EQ2 which isn't half bad.  Not the best (I don't have my bookmarks here 
at work) but it's certainly ok.

What types of information are you looking for?
