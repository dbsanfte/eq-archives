This would probably be a bad idea in most situations because sooner or
later you will want to track something, and it wont be available
because you just turned left.

You guys keep talking about moving the window or shrinking it.  Why? 
It has a minimize option.  That little cirle in the top pane of the
track window will make it in to a tiny little bar.  Click it again and
the full window is open again.
