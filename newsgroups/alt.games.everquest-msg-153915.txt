when the price increase came around.  Will I now have to pay again to
continue playing on Antonius Bayle?  Is Antonius Bayle a US server in the
UK, or will it be a localised UK server?

Okie... here's what I know and can guess at...

The Bayles' will remain as Verant/SOE run 'US servers'

There will be a 'UK localised' server run by Ubisoft (yet to be named... the
choices are Tanaan, Venril Sathir, The Grey, Serpents Spine, Dragons Drool,
Odus or Kidzean Gix) which will have a more 'GMT' oriented GM/Guide set up.

At the moment, there will be no /movelog. Understandable as such a move
would require PHYSICALLY moving the character data for a few thousand
accounts between not just servers, but 2 different companies (more on that
later).


The reason for PoP being released late in Europe appears to be the fact that
UbiSoft will not just be importing/re-selling the CDs made in the US, but
manufacturing their OWN copies for sale. UbiSoft apparently won't get their
'master copy' of PoP until there are SOE made retail boxes already on the
shelves in the US... and then UbiSoft have to go through the process of
testing, remastering and duplicating before they can get their 'home made'
boxes of PoP into the stores in Europe.

What does this mean for you?
Well, seeing as UbiSoft are actually stumping up their own cash in an
attempt to run a semi-independant version of EQ, I can now better understand
the recent events and WHY they seem to be intent on screwing Euro players...
they're not. What's actually happening is they're trying to avoid a
situation where SOE and UbiSoft are screwing each other out of
subscribers...


SOE tells the group "Okay... you guys ready to run your own servers?"

UbiSoft tells the group "Almost... just don't release PoP in Europe yet...
we're not gonna make the launch date"

SOE tells the group "Fair enough... we don't want your lawyers accusing us
of poaching customers with our already established servers"

UbiSoft tells the group "Maybe we should have planned our dates a bit
better?"

SOE tells the group "Well, we already had a date set for PoP... we need the
extra revenue for the Christmas period... you're on your own"

UbiSoft tells the group "Jeeze, that's a bit nasty"

SOE tells the group "Yeah, well... we're now competing against each other
for a finite number of customers with a game that's already nearly 4 years
old"

UbiSoft tells the group "Damn... we're getting flak from the players over
the delays... we've already had to ban one guy, and we haven't even STARTED
the beta phase!!"

SOE tells the group "Okay... as one last favour, we'll announce we're
beating a couple of classes to death with the Nerf Stick... that'll distract
the little bastards for a few weeks"

UbiSoft tells the group "Thanks =)"
