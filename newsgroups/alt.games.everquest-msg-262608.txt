Not that anyone would have enforced those sanctions.  Bush wasn't around
yet.  =)

Beyond that, Japan has been free to modify their constitution since the
1950s.  If you think that they haven't in the half a century since then due
to the US...  well, you'd be right, but it's not due to the US telling them
they can't change the constitution.  It's due to the US having shown them
just how bad war can be.
