I'm bad at the grass thing -- it's the main reason why I rereolled my monk 
into a warrior; so far I haven't regretted it, and I'm enjoying the Iksar 
warrior pike quests (just got my geozite tool and am now hunting froglok 
escorts in the swamp, woo).

Glad to hear that Lenny's enjoying his new career, by the way.  :)
