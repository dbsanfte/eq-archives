Hi,

Im a level 6 scout (wont let me level to 7).

I need to find 5 coins in the Cave. I found sewers (is that the cave ?) and
after at least 20 creatures, still no coins. So I believe this is not the
cave. Can anyone tell me where is that "/%&?* cave please ?

Damn all those "must do" quests are annoying.
