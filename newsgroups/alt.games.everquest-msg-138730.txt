I've been working on maxing out my Defense since as a cleric it atrophied
quite a lot from sitting on my butt and medding all the time.

I'm wondering if there's a formula for what the maximum skill I can attain
at each level?

Also, will the max for Offense and Defense always be the same number?

What about 1HB? How can I tell what the max for that will be for a cleric at
any given level? It seems quite a bit lower than Offense and Defense
although it is also listed as Master.
