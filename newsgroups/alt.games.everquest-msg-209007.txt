OK, 500 trader slots per server.  On EMarr at least, I have never once 
seen it full, usually varies from the upper 200s to the low 400s.  Most 
people do not leave a trader up.

So, that is probably sufficient for most people.

For a hardcore player, or someone who wants to leave a trader mule up, 
obviously, this is not the case.
