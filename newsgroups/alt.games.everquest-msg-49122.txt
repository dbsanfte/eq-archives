 You can easily upgrade the client without adding any more spell slots.
They've already stated it's more a balance issue rather than them not
being able to do it. If you only have 8 you need to plan more carefully
on which ones you memorize. Playing two casters in my time it is a pain
at times to have to cast, unmem, mem a new one then cast. That doesn't
really happen too often though. Many people have levelled to 60 and
conquered the toughest zones with just 8 spell slots.
