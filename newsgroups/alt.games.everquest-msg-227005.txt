The most likely reason is because no one healed you, because no one was
paying attention. I read in the other thread that you were in a group with
the 65 Paladin and he has a group heal for 600-700 or so so. IMO that should
be quite enough to keep your group from dying to RF's AoE (which is 400 or
so I think). And if you were standing next to the mob you should be in range
of heals. So I believe that either other healers were dead, maybe your
paladin was feared, or he was just an idiot. In the future if you are losing
HP's and close to dying you should say something to the raid. If theres no
real healer in your group you cant expect ones outside your group to know
what your HP level is, you have to inform them. Also if you are getting
dangerously low on health simply move out of AoE range.

Forget about the resists too, unless your resists are at 200+ you wont be
resisting much. If you had no raid resist buffs from druid or cleric at
least all I can say is those people suck.
