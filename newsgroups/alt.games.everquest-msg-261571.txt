At level 65, I find that I usually don't have to debuff the mobs in LDoNs 
for about the first 20 to 40% of the adventure.  As we get further in, 
slows seem to be resisted more, and I find it's better to use Malos on 
them first.  At level 40, you don't have an unresistable debuff 
unfortunately, so you will have to hope your Malo-x line spell sticks 
first, or have someone in the group that has an unresistable debuff hit 
the mobs first, or just keep trying to slow, which, is a huge agro 
builder.
