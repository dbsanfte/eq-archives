Great post, as always - and I apologize for addressing a point of it
so long after the fact. :)

<equal amount of snippage>

Surely you understand the confusion here, tho.  The Carprin portion of
CoD IS actually a key AND a flag; if you type /eky, that's where the
CoDb flag is shown, not through guided meditation at the Seer.  Thus,
with the Solusek Ro portion being a flag that is not a key (and yet it
is, in a weird way), it's not surprising that people would think that
the 85% flag rule would be in effect.
