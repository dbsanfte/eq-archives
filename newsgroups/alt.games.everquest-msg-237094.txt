Exactly why I gave up on the game. They also have no qualms about
nerfing a class unintentionally, when they decide to nerf a line shared
with another class. Shadowblades got a double nerf, once on their own
then another when Berserkers were nerfed because they shared the Left
Axe style.

Personally, I found that while the leveling speed was faster than EQ's,
the pve was so tedious it seemed 10 times as long. At least when you get
to mid levels in EQ fighting mobs can be fun and challenging with a good
group, but in DaoC it just seemed like a boring grind.
