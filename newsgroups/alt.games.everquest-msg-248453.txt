*WAVE ARMS FRANTICALLY AT ALL THE BICKERING PEOPLE*

HELLO?!  Any of you people actually pay enough attention to the
information on EQ2 to know that they took the "you can't train" out of the
game? Dear gods, far be it for you to do your research.  But no, don't let
the facts get in your way, keep arguing about a fictious game.

*snort*

Sorry, Don, not kvetching at you specifically, you were just the last link
in a chain of posts about this system that isn't actually going to
exist.  I see a LOT of arguing about why EQ2 will suck or won't, and half
of the information folks are bandying about sounds made up or 3rd
hand.
