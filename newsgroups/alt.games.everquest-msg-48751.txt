>said Please."

As a newbie, I never even thought to ask anyone to heal me, however, all of
you nice people on EverQuest have been very generous to me.  Althought I
have never asked, I've been healed while I was fighting (with my little
human warrior), healed while I was sitting down waiting for time to take
it's course, been given infravision because I was bumping into walls before
I could afford a torch, been given strength and fast feet for no particualar
reason but I did use it as long as I could and I want to thank all of you
who help us newbies without our even asking.

P.S.  My warrior is level 4 now.  =)
