I have been playing on Quellious, and have several items for trade to anyone
that can give me something decent on Tunare.  I switched servers to play
with co-workers, and won't be playing on Quell anymore.  The Quell character
has Tolan's Darkwood Helm and Arms, Tree Weave, Spider Fur Cloak-Belt-Neck,
a pair of ac6/65hitpoint rings, silver-plated legs, rubicite boots, centi
shortsword, hero bracer, and some other stuff I can't remember.  I don't
care if I get screwed, I just need some stuff for my new character on
Tunare....and anything is better then nothing.  You can have all of my stuff
on Quellious.  email me at ablind@tampabay.rr.com
