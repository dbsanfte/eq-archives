 Truesilver is very rare. Out of 100+ hours there I think I've only seen
two pieces.

 Technically not correct. Some of the ghost mobs (Warder of Xalgoz? Or
maybe those are skellies. I can't remember) will give you -VenrilSathir
hits. If it was just the spiders it wouldn't be a big deal since you can
choose where to fight. I was at church recently helping someone camp for
fangs and I cringed everytime I took a -VS hit from some dumb ghost.
