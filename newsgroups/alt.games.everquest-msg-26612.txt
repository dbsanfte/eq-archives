Let's say I have an Iksar character that is trying to boost their
faction so I go and kill a bunch of gnolls and have a bunch of gnoll
teeth to turn in to the guy in the Qeynos warrior guild.  However, I
can't find a druid around that can turn me into wolf form so I can
turn the teeth in.  If I went and joined a group with, example, a
human warrior, and gave the gnoll teeth to the warrior and had him
turn the teeth in (while we are still grouped), would my Iksar still
get the faction boost, or does my character actually have to turn in
the teeth myself?

Thanks in advance,
