I dunno about the length, but CQ on Lanys (the PoT guild) already
cleared the bosses down there - Nice neck haste item, FT2/IDIV boots.

Well, first they need to fix it - the scroll is labeled Kindle,
but you scribe the LoY spell "Elemental Empathy" when you use
it :-P

This takes the pet from completely useless to not quite completely
useless.  Someone offered to trade me the 63 fire pet for my
banked (I was 63) Planar renewal once.  After I picked myself
up off the floor from laughing so hard, I politely said no.

Very nice, I'm leveling my enchanter 'bot atm and this will make
the 50's a bit nicer.

My last experience with ID was at 29 in FM by the fort when a stupid
monk kept ID'ing the mob, causing it to charge off across the zone with
my pet in tow.  Of course, this was when you still needed the spellbook
to med, so the first I'd know of it was when the combat spam stopped.  
Worse, back then pet commands were /say range only, so the pet was 
already OOR of the /pet back off command.

Invigor is under healing too.

The wierd one is that Transon's Phantasmal Protection (mage
level 58 4mana/5hp per tick spell) is under hp buffs, but
Xegony's Phantasmal guard (upgrade - 6mana/5hp per tick) is
under "Regen"

I bugged it, but apparently they ignored it :-)
