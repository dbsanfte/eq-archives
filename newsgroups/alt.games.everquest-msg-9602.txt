Well we all gotta have goals in life, Ronnie. And if you're going to
set goals, you may as well set them really really low.

Thing is... 47 years old at last count, yeah? Thats only 18 years away
from retirement age. The clock is ticking, Ronald. Maybe if you get
off your fat arse and stop playing EQ and wearing out your Google
bookmark, you might have a chance of achieving your dreams. 

Then again... nah.

More likely, you'll take out your Glock one day and just go "postal".
