So now I am REALLY confused.  The game starts at 45 vs. the game sucks after
45?  Maybe it sucks altogether and I just don't know it.  I really wanted to
sit back and enjoy the ride to 50, raiding, going to cool dungeons etc...
but I haven't been able to find a guild that raids at under 45.  Heck it
seems like you're not even doing the "real" guild thing until 50+ at all.
So what gives?
