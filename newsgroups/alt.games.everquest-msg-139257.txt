Duel is one of the Default social macro's set up on the first screen.  There
are 10 defaults set up, /duel among them, /who all gm, etc.  Maybe you
accidently moved the default macro do another place.  Also there is a /
command to create hotbuttons, when I'm typing every once and a while I
accidently set it off and end up with a hotkey created on my cursur.
Anyways, /duel is one of the defaults, so thats prorbably where you are
getting it from.
