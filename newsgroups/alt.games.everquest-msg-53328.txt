I ding a lot.  It's fun to share your achievements with others.  I usually 
send grats to others who ding.  It just feels nice and social.  And 
dinging level 2 is fun, just as a sort of spoof of all that. :)

}>8) Use the abbreviations "plz" or "thx".  Looks
}>stupid.
}And shows a lack of respect. If you want *me* to take the time to do
}something for you, you'd better spell out "please".

Definitely.  The one that really makes me laugh is 'PLLLZZZZZ!!'  I mean, 
come on, it's more keystrokes and you had to find shift.  plz or thx may 
be acceptable if there's actual combat or rushing involved in some way.  
But 95% of the people who do it are just being annoyingly lazy.

}>5) Constantly ask in open channels where various

}>zone by going to eqatlas.com.
}Amen. I'm amazed by the number of people who apparently cannot think
}for themselves. If you're in South Karana, just where in the hell do
}you *think* North Karana might be? Hmmm? Would you like us to chew
}your food for you too?

Pff.  That looks bad when you're halfway across the zone from someone, 
sure, but we're not always aware of the whole situation.  Sure, I look 
locs up on eqatlas all the time.  then I write them down and lose the 
scrap of paper, or don't write them down and forget them, but figure it's 
not important since I've found LR from SK a thousand times.  However, I 
may not have considered that I'd be trying to find it after shadowstepping 
20 times with a big red-con treant hauling ass after me... and it'd realy 
help if someone just -happens- to know the dang east-west coordinate so I 
can make sure I'm going the right way...

}>3) Inspect others without asking first.  You 
}>might not mind if others inspect you, but there
}>are several people who do.  Considered to be
}>extremely rude in many circles.
}I've never been able to agree with this one, and I still don't. The
}Inspect function is a built-in part of the game. People who don't like
}to be inspected can simply turn off the inspect message. Inspecting is
}not even close to the same thing as a full body cavity search, and
}people shouldn't react as if it were.

Some mind, some don't.  Asking takes 3 seconds.  Nuff said.

What -I'd- really like is if inspecting was bound to an obscure key, like 
'>' or something, instead of being a right-click action.  I right-click 
for a lot of other things, and I occasionally forget to turn /inspect off 
again.  It'd just be nice if there was an easier way to avoid 
unintentional inspections.  But it's mostly not a huge deal.  To me, 
anyway.
