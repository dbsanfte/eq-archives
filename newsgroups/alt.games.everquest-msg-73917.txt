You probably should switch to a wizard, your playing more along those lines
of style than an enchanter.  Although I personally as an enchanter have done
this also, its far and few between, and use debuffs also, like slow.

charm / using pet is mutually exclusive.  You almost always should be using
one a pet while hunting.  Unless your in a group where you feel safe, you
need that extra tank to protect your fragile body.

You want to play along your strengths.  Enchanter class is more group
oriented, so you almost always wanna group over solo-ing.  Even at 12th -
15th.  if you feel the urge to play solo with your enchanter, go ahead.
Just think ahead when soloing.  Buff your pet with obscure / str / speed
(16th level spell), get SOW for at least yourself so you can run if
necessary.  Even if your going to a dungeon, you can get a SOW from outside
before you go in from your friendly neighborhood druid / shaman.  Try to get
buffs that make you superior, like from a 50 + druid or cleric.  Expect to
die alot soloing.   :)

Tash is a lower magic resistance spell.  Its not a fear spell.

You want to have all your buffs up.  this is strength, obscure (or better
version), lesser shielding (self only buff, that is what yellow color
means), etc.  You want to get as many other helpful self buffs around
you/from group.  clerics / shamans / druids all have useful spells that
would help you survive.

You want to use your debuffs.  You want to set up a system for where you put
your spells, so you know exactly where they are and don't constantly keep
moving the same spell.  Personally my system is:

slot 1: best DD
slot 2: best DOT
slot 3: GATE
slot 4: exchangable  (buffs / debuffs)
slot 5: exchangable  (buffs / debuffs)
slot 6: best TASH
slot 7: best MEZ ( swap out for AE mez if fighting too many / or use slot 4
or 5 )
slot 8: best mem blur

the reason for a system is so you don't waste precious time wondering where
you put that gate spell.  invariably being organized will save you time
trying to organize in the middle of a fight so you can better determine
things like is it time to run.

The enchanter class main job at 12th to 15th in a group should be crowd
control / debuffing.  If you have high cha, you could even consider using
your new charm at 12th.  your best bet is to wait though until you are
around 16th to 20th before you start using this spell.  Its pretty dicey to
use even then, and you need a solid group to support the risk of failure.

I remember several times that charming spell casters would turn an
unwinnable fight into relatively easy at dervs in North Ro.  you want back
up rooter / healer if your going to try and charm.    be prepared to die
doing this.   : )

read guides about how to be a more effective enchanter at
http://eq.castersrealm.com  - this site was actually originally only for
enchanters anyhows, so way back they were one of the gospel sites for
enchanters.  look up all the details on each spell you have, and what you
are missing.  ( reason why I'm pointing this out is because I don't feel
like righting 10 pages about all my suggestions, which is mostly from
experience / agreeing with others/ repeating what I was told)

P.S.  we still need more than 8 slots for spells.  : )
