Greetings all, would love some feedback on an idea I think would be
great for EQ. It partly springs from being bored out of my mind in
OT but never knowing where else I might find a group. Especially 
since I play in the Australian evening, which is some god-forsaken
hour in the American morning.

The idea should be fairly simple to impliment...as far as I can see
all the pieces are already in the game.

1) Extend the /who functionality so I can check who is in a zone
i'm not in. Since I can do;
	/who all
and see people in other zones the functionality must be there. And
you can opt out by going /anon or /roleplay. This way if I am
in Freeport I could do;
	/who all cazic-thule
and find out if there's anyone in the zone. And then potentially
use some /tells to see if they'll be there for a while and have
a space for my character.

2) Add another tag called "looking for more". It works like /lfg
but one when you are in a group. Effectively it states that you
are looking to grow a group in an underpopulated zone. When the
group breaks up the tag is cleared (as /lfg is when you join a
group). You could also make it so that only the party leader (the
one who offered invites) could use it. Using this I could do;
	/who all lfm
or;
	/who all 30 40 lfm
and see if there are people in my level range who might have a
use for my character.

The aim is to make it easier for groups to form and grow, especially
in some of the less utilized zones (such as dungeons). Because while
I don't like grinding in OT much I like sitting in an empty zone
even less. Especially if i've run, swum and caught those insanely
slow boats to get there.

Mind you the other approach is to make a soloist (so you can do
something in an empty zone) or a druid (so it takes less time
to get to the empty zone).

Any thoughts?
