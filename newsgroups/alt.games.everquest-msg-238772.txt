I gave up on it prettty quick, other than an occasional trip where we
can drag a lower level melee along to loot the Shadowflame. Probably
around 10 kills now w/o seeing the ring.  

I just don't get that excited any more about gear in EQ so it's hard
to justify wasting the time of my friends to camp something. Why waste
the time on a long camp or raiding when you know any item you get will
be obsolescent in 6 months anyway when a new expansion comes out.
