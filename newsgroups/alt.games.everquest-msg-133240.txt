I find that annoying as well. I am not sure if it does it each time I 
zone, I'll have to check next time. It does seem to reset often though, 
and it doesn't always reset to the same thing. Sometimes it will reset me 
to a bald Wood Elf, thereby making me look like some guy in REM. Other 
times it puts my hair long and flowing and brown, which still sucks cuz it 
looks too girly.
