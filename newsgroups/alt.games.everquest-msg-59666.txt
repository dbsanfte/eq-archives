I wonder if that isn't just a sign of a healthy guild that's going to
grow and prosper, and likewise, if a lack of that is a sign of problems?
The guild that I've been in for over fifty levels (about to draw to a
close, sadly) has mostly a good bunch of friends, a couple of
established hunting groups, but not much of that "trickle down" ever
happens. On the (rare) occasions where I've taken a pretty good item and
given it to a guildmate free when I upgraded to something better, I've
pretty much had it pissed on. (Before uberguild members start scoffing,
these are "pretty good" items in terms of untwinked mid thirties
characters.)  When I gave away the crystallized two handed sword that I
used for thirty levels or so, I ran into the guy only days later and
found out he traded it for something else and some cash. And this guy
had been *begging* me for that sword for some time.

Likewise, on a second occasion, I'd looted something (I believe from
Dalnir) which was not usable by my class, and passed it on to a member
of that class from my guild for free. They sold it outright for cash,
and were happy enough to tell all of us in guildchat (while I was
online) how much they got for it. (Not an uber item, but in the one to
two K range, still.) I could have used the money. Well, since then, I've
generally *gotten* the fucking money, because warriors are very
equipment intensive and expensive to maintain and upgrade. That looks to
be the general attitude of most of the guild. I wonder if that's why we
never got any further than bush league?
