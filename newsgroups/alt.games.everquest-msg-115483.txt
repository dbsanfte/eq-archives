Well - I've had several folks at The Magicians Tower now say you can get
from the sky level down into the throne room area without a rogue 
(Remember my last time there, we stopped short of going all the way up, we
were still in the hallway leading up, when our puller fell off the sky
bridge :/  That means she was pulling from the bridge down into the
hallway, so I'm hoping that the door other people are talking about is the
one listed on Platform 8 on the map at eqatlas.  If that's the case, then
you can lev and run right over it, as at least 2 people have told me.  
Also, more people corroborated that Neh Ashiir drops a no rent key to the
elevator.  

Unfortunately the raid got cancelled - the raid leader is being
conservative (he doesn't want to get 24 people there just to find out
we can't do it - perfectly understandable).  However, my usual XP 
group sounds like there up to a little recce to see if we can get to
Neh Ashiir (we won't have the healing to take him), and establish that we
can get down to the throne room without a rogue.

We're going to do that in a few hours - I could die horribly :)
