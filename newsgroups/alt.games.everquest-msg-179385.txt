I am going to lauuuuuuugh at all the trolls I've seen hunting guards...

Tonight was a LOT of fun.  True, I lost a level, because I just 
automatically clicked my DE mask so I could see where I was going in 
Innothule swamp, and I figured "trolls don't like barbarians, but they 
like DEs".  Run run run, where the hell am I? Where's Gu-BAM"  A few 
more BAMs and I was dead, level 35 again, and carrying a grudge towards 
frogs.  But, what the hell.  I looted, watched a few people killing 
frogs, a few people healing frogs, looted the frog corpses rotting and 
got some fine steel.  Well, hello, mister frog, I do like you dead.  I 
ran over to see what was going on at Grobb and oh hello there mother 
lode.  Roughly 50 plat in coin loot, 33 fine steel warhammers, 3 
ivories, 1 flame agate, 1 amber, 2 jade, 3 pearls, 2 jade earrings, 1 
fine steel rapier, 1 mithril earring, and 1 silver amulet later... :D  I 
had nearly 400pp by the time I was done, having started out the night at 
around 70.  Annoyingly, 2 out of about a dozen screenshots I took turned 
out, the rest were total black screen right down to where the text boxes 
were.  Grrr.  I had some damn good shots, too.  There were dozens upon 
dozens of frogs at the entry, and the bashers, spawning at the zone to 
Grobb and running out to join the fray, didn't last long.  Just about 
died again when I got too close to the zoneline while looting and was 
the first thing a basher looked at when he spawned (yay for close 
zonelines) - can't win - if I'm DE, the frogs hate me.  If I'm 
barbarian, the trolls hate me. ;p  When it started slowing down outside, 
I zoned in and sneaked in, looked around, and didn't bother sneaking 
anymore.  The frogs were everywhere, racing in and out of every doorway 
they could find, and once in awhile I'd see a troll running by with at 
least a dozen frogs on him.  I spied a froglok prisoner early on in the 
fight, but he disappeared and was replaced by a dark-blue con spider of 
some sort (looks like the spiders that spawn in Feerott) and an "animal 
trainer" froglok.  I hailed him, and he talked about his animals, and I 
managed to get one key phrase and get him to talk a little more, but 
couldn't get any more out of him.  Then again, I have no patience for 
quests ;p  The instant every troll in there was dead, frogloks spawned 
EVERYWHERE.  Vendor frogloks, trainer frogloks, guard frogloks, and NPC 
quest frogloks.  And even a prisoner basher troll :)  Killing him gives 
no faction hits of any kind.  Killing the "tame" bugs (mosquitoes and 
spiders) wandering around gave no faction hits and caused no fuss from 
the frogs.  And oh, the poor troll SK that got caught in there when all 
the frogs popped :D  Someone eventually grouped with him while he was FD 
and TL'd him out of there to PoK.  I pointed out that his last name, 
"Isfromgrobb" or something of the sort, was now nothing more than a 
memorial.  Poor trolls.  But I will say this - that was an actual FUN GM 
event - first one where after I died, I looked around and thought "ah, 
the hell with it!" and ran in for more.
