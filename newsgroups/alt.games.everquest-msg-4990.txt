Well then thanks for the info. Guess that settles it. I was looking for a
medium sized class that has a good warrior, and at the same time I like my
Ogre, with the exception of being KOS and having the extreme difficulty of
finding large armor to wear (and large costs MUCH more). So I finally found
a race that is a mix of the two, and a good mix too.
    I'll start though, but first got to do a little research and even before
that got to finish something else I'm working on. "The Legend of Zelda:
Majora's Mask". But I'm near the end (just got the player's guide this past
weekend and am going for EVERYTHING that I can).
