WC druids can be hunted at your level, though may be a bit dangerous.  Fear
one, then fear kite the other.  Your fear will break on the first before the
second is dead, just refear when he gets close.  Remember to cancel magic on
them (the DSs on them are a pain and also, they will be SOWd).  You will get
resists as they will be yellow/red to you at 29.  I seem to recall that they
are level 30 to 34 (but I may be mistaken).

The druids in NK at the rings won't be handled by your duo for another 3 or
4 levels (I HATE TREANTS!).  Also, there are more of them and they will
multi-aggro when you ST/Fear any of them (plus they heal/buff each other).
