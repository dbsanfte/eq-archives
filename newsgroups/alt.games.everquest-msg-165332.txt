Lets hope not, the idea that Verant would listen to all the Whining will
lead to EQ2 being as weak as DAoC turned out.
Although this is already the way I fear EQ2 will go.

Just to bring up you point about what makes more noise in this newsgroup,
the Whiners or those that say STFU and stop Whining, well what does that
tell you about how the majority of players (here) see the game? So if anyone
from VI/SOE are reading do you think they read these whines and think they
are opinions shared by everyone?
