Well, obviously it's very easy to take that point of view if you spend
most of your time grouping. Why worry about the other guy when you're
getting what you want?  But when you have two distinct styles of player,
and you start changing the rules to benefit one group, while doing
nothing for the other in the same area (i.e. experience points) then you
*are* effectively hurting the other group. I keep hearing people
complain about the lack of "bonus points" for grouping, or how it's so
slow and takes so long to level in a big group, etc.  Well, it would
seem to me that this would be the tradeoff, no? In a big group you have
very little to worry about in terms of dying, having to run away, etc. 
(And yes, there are exceptions with extreme high level mobs, but
please... a little common sense here.) For the most part, you will be
comfy and safe in a well run group killing mobs all the live long day. 
For those who choose to attempt to solo all these creatures, they
*should* have a built-in advantage in the experience point area. The
risk is larger. They can still get plenty of interaction with other
players on the server, and/or can join a group whenever they want if the
opportunity is present.
