To get out you have to get up onto the lip near one of the two
bridges.  Can't do that heading in towards town, have to do it on
the outer wall.  For the bridge near shadeweaver, head up to the
left of the bridge, go up as high as you can and as left as you
can, then try to move up higher and jump (the spacebar key if you
haven't remapped it for some reason).  You may have to play around
a bit here to do this, a little further left or a bit to the
right, but the idea is that there's a small ledge you have to hop
up onto.  Once you get up, move back to the right to the bridge
and you are out.

The exit strategy on the Hollowshade side is similar, but I don't
recall the particulars as well.  Still, if you play around a bit
you should be able to find a way up onto the bridge from the
underside away from town.

One problem here; if you are fatigued (yellow bar completely gone)
you will be unable to jump.  If you let yourself run totally out
of food and drink down there, and use up your whole fatigue bar,
you will be completely stuck.  Of course, if your character is
under level 10, this only means you have to take the third way
out; attack one of the guards, get killed, and poof, you reappear
up at your bind spot.

Fourth way out is to Gate, if you happen to be a caster; only Vah
Shir that can do it is the Shaman, and you'd have to be level 5+
and have the spell.

Fifth way out is to get someone to port you out; specifically a
druid or wizard.

Sixth is for a wizard to Translocate you out

Seventh is to use one of a number of gate casting items; there are
potions, spiritstones, faithstones, a hammer that procs gate to
Overthere...

Eighth is to group with a Mage who can use Call of the Hero to
port you to his location, assuming he's not down in the pit with
you

Ninth is to die (as in the third way) and then get your body
dragged out of the pit; if you die right up near the lip you can
come to it with your new naked self, drag it up (type /corpse) and
loot it.

Tenth is to die (seeing a theme?) and get a necro to summon your
corpse

Eleventh, if you happen to already have a freshly dead body up out
of the pit somewhere, is to get a cleric or paladin (or necro or
someone with a clicky rez item) to rez you to it.

I can't think of a twelth way out, used to be you could get in
duel and Grav Flux up, but thats been nerfed.
