I beg to differ here...  to say that they are just as important is a bit of
an understatement.  In my opinion, I will choose a Druid over anyone else
for grouping and so forth.  Of course, I am a Druid's pet...  hehe  but
still...  The very idea that a group would not allow their Druid to loot
items boggles my mind.  I'm sure that this original poster is just an idiot,
but have any Druid's ever encountered such a thing?  A group is a group.
All share in kills, all share in loot.  That is that.

Thanks for listening...
