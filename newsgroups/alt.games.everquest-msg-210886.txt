Two things that reminded me of my experiences:

First is that you have a crap modem.  A few months ago I was subjected
to the horrors of using a dialup to get in the game.  I was able to
get right up to the character select screen, then I would go LD as the
modem dropped me when I tried to enter.  Turns out the modem, which
wasnt cheap (had call waiting and other crap such crap on it), still
relied on the CPU to run it's calculations or something like that.  It
placed too great a burdon on the processor even though the computer
itself was plenty prepared to run EQ once I put in a "real" modem.

Other thing is...have you run a virus checker?
