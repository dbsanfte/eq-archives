Here's a hypothetical:

I'ts nighttime.

Your neighbour has hacked your account in a game where the EULA doesn't
spell out who owns the items and you spot  they guy about to delete your
character. The company running  the game was contacted when you found out,
and they told you to call the police as they didn't deal with such things
and wouldn't recover the character if it was deleted. You called the police
and they tell you to call the gaming company.

If you don't act now, your character, who you worked on 10 hours a day for 6
years, will be gone forever. You have a legally registered gun and are in
Texas.

It seems to me that ". he reasonably believes that:   A. to prevent the
other's imminent commission of arson, burglary, robbery, aggravated robbery,
theft during the nighttime, or criminal mischief during the nighttime,
.... the land or property cannot be protected or recovered by any other
means " applies in this case?

I guess the question legally is, is a virtual item property? And if there's
no EULA stating ownership, surely the player is the owner, and he/she is
therefore entitled to defend their property within the boundaries of law, in
the same way they can defend against someone who steals a plastic imitation
sword worth 50 cents? Maybe there's more to the code than I know of that is
relevant but as far as i can see the boundary is whether or not the item is
property, not whether it is valuable.
