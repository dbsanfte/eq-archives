I used the pet trick too, it worked great.  Follow direction pet is
pointing, attempting to drop an item every few steps, until I got the right
message.  OK, I did trigger the death squad the first time, I took a few too
many steps.  My pet valiantly sacrificed himself in about 3 seconds while I
was booking out of there.  That was when I found out that the death squad
runs very very fast.  I did manage to gate out while all 4 were pummelling
me, I was actually shocked at that one channelling through.
