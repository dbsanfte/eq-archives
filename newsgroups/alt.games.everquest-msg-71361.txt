On the contrary, all my characters are casters and I couldn't be happier. =) No
more getting tells from someone who wants me to stop what I'm doing, run to the
gate or the bank or where ever and bind them. Yipee!!! I always did it for them,
mind you, and I never charged for it, because I know it must be a pain not to be
able to do something as simple and necessary as bind; but I didn't much enjoy
it. I'm perfectly happy to be relieved of that responsibility. Now if Verant
would just put in SoW and port NPCs it would be perfect. /grin
