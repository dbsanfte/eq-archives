Bards are incredibly powerful - the joke in the bard community
has always been that the only thing keeping SOE from nerfing them
is that they don't understand the code behind the songs.

Lol - this was more aimed at the tremendous prevalence of 'bots
in the game - heck I can bot my mage or my cleric without even
looking at the screen.  I'd like to see the usefulness of 'botting
reduced by making a fully played character far more powerful than
one who's player is only marginally there.

Bleah, see my reply to myself - I thought I was being bitchy :-)

Actually, for EQ2 I'd like to see them get rid of multiple song
effects up at once completely.  It's always strained my suspension
of disbelief that he's singing 3 seconds of one song, then 3 of the
next, then 3 of the next (the same 3 seconds of each song?  That
wiz he's standing next to would eventually crack and turn him into
a cinder!)  Instead I'd like to see 1 song effect up at a time,
with them being more powerful than any single song is now, and,
perhaps, multiple effects on the song as you get higher.  Then, to
make the fighting interesting, custom moves like in DAoC (one of
the things I REALLY like about DAoC) Maybe custom song flourishes
instead of special attack moves?  Anyway, something to make combat
interesting, and individual, while getting rid of the annoying
guy singing snatches of the same 3 songs over and over again.

Scene - The Entrance to the Hole
Warrior is furiously battling an elemental crusader
Bard is playing a song that simultaneously disorients and slows
the elemental, while inspiring the warrior
Wizard unleashes a tremendous shock of magical power, causing
the elemental to decide he's the most dangerous person in view
Bard executes a /SPEED METAL RIFF (at a cost of stamina) sending
the warrior into a frenzy - delivering a flurry of agonizing cuts
to the Crusader, causing it to re-evaluate who it needs to beat
up, and it switches back to the warrior.

?  an idea at any rate.
