I have a lvl 35 druid (probably lvl 34 now, yet another LD) anyhow I get
asked for TP's all the time (SoW at my lvl doesnt really bother me) but the
best one I had was today.

I was on Lucin and someone from Lavastorm telled me and asked to TP there
and pick him up and TP him to BB. When I said its a bit out of the way that
one. He said well just bind yourself and do it!

To all the non casters out there, let me explain this would max out all my
mana and cost me like 30mins in play time, tping and resting etc then
rebuffing myself and resting up again ready to fight.

I think its just down to people who haven't played casters not knowing what
is really involved.
