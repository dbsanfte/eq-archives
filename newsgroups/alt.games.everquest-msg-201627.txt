Well, since you only have the classic, Everfrost still works well at
that level, either solo or in a group. I don't think the mobs further
out on the tundra start turning light blue till around 14th lvl. One
of the best spots to pull to if you're solo is that flat area in front
of the North Platform (where the DoT vendor is). Pull from across the
river and you can usually fight without getting adds. Money is decent
if you save the tailoring components and guards are pretty close. Just
be careful around the orc shaman, they'll root you. 

Other spots if you want to travel some, Oasis for an orc group, pullng
scarabs in North Karana down by the wizard spire. East Karana down by
the Gorge Entrance.
