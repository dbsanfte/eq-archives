You miss, the Cleric misses, sometimes the Cleric gets a lucky run of procs,
sometimes they don't... I'm still pretty confident in your ability to
outdamage -and- out tank a Cleric in melee.

I'll probably have to get a correction, but if I recall correctly the melee
bonuses looks kind of like this:

Monks, Rogues, Rangers, Warriors, Shadow Knights/Paladins, Bards/Beastlords.

That could be incorrect of course, hopefully someone will correct me if I'm
wrong.

You're comparing Cleric melee to Knight melee. Apples-and-oranges. I have a
56 Cleric friend that does around 11 DPS with just her melee (no hammer pet
and no MoR). So once again, either her melee is uncommonly low, or someone
has been misleading you.

I must be missing something. What Twain quote?

The: "There are lies, damn lies, and statistics." remark?

I sure hope not... because it was Benjamin Disraeli that said that.

"There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics."
-Benjamin Disraeli

Just for you, I'll quote Mark Twain at the end of my post.
