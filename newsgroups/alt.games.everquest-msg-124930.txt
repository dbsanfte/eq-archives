At least 10 1-1/2 wide notebooks mostly full of maps from EQ Atlas, but
other stuff too such as tradeskill info, and character skill stuff.

Maps are organized by continent so far.  That seems to work pretty well.
Antonica has so many zones, though, that we had to split it into two
(still growing) notebooks.

Not much paper on quests or price info as of yet.
