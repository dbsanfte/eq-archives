Same here.

Some kind soul equipped my druid at lvl5, good enough equipment that he is
still using at lvl17. One guy gave me 50pp for telling him a joke.

Today, someone outfitted my barbarian warrior, before he logged out.

I only play a few hours a week, but I must say I have met very few unlikable
people in the game so far.
