"Take it easy, man. The guy just wants what you paid for free because, well,

fellow who wants to steal it."

"I mean, the folks at Honda are making plenty of money anyway. If I had a
set of tools, I'd go steal a car off their lot. Who gives a crap if one
driver does not pay?"

"This is the year 2000, man, get your morals away from me. Life is about
freedom, man, not living under the corporate man's rule. Steal from him
whenever you can. Nothing wrong with that."
