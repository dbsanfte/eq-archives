Ok, currently I have one machine that is upstairs with a broadband cable
modem.  I am looking in the near future to aquire a new computer.  This
machine will reside downstairs.  What are my alternatives to networking
these two machines together so that they both can use the internet
simutaniously? Would the 2.4Ghz wireless be an option? Also, they said the
router must be 'dynamic' - please explain. I understand majority of computer
knowldege but this networking deal is new to me. Thanks.
