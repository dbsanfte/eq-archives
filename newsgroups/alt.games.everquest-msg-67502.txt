 It's the GMs way of keeping track of players who repetedly make
trouble and/or ruin gameplay for others. If you are reported or
petitioned they look up your record and make decisions based on
that record accordingly.
 
 For instance, if a player petitions and reports another player 
for bad language over open channels and the GM looks up the 
record and sees 37 instances of such behavior in the past, the 
reported play just may find that he is no longer online and no
longer has an active account or his characters have been wiped.
