I'm about to hit lvl 56, and the old hunting grounds are thinning out 
fast. With any luck, in the next few weeks I should have a computer 
which may just about be capable of handling the Planes, so I'm keen to 
see what my options are there. The problem is that I'm a bit of a picky 
customer when it comes to hunting; I like it safe, even if it's slow, 
and I'm partial to root-dotting (there is nothing like reading a.g.e as 
you get xp). In terms of pain-in-the-neck (by that, I mean mostly 
breaking root), Elysians in Umbral Plains are about the maximum level 
I'm willing to put up with.

So, is there any place in the Planes where a 56 Druid can make some 
decent, safe XP, or am I doomed to chase out the last few remaining 
blues in Burning Wood and Skyfire until I hit 60?

On a related note... Is Fungus Grove a practical place for a druid to 
solo? I've been a couple of times, and I seem to remember the mobs being 
quite tight, and of course, being an indoors zone, Harmony wouldn't do 
me much good.
