FWIW, agreed.  I too stopped pre-ordering.  I'm new to the game, only been 
playing for about 2 years, and used to pre-order all the time.  After GoD, 
that was it.  These new expansions will 1) have to prove their worth and 2) 
be debugged by others, before I'll buy.

Another thing that may be germain to this thread.  Did you guys get the e-
mail from SOE on getting "Buddy Keys" which gives you a free copy of 
"Trilogy"?  Sony seems to be fishing deep to make those new catches.
