In the "Ranger lvl 12 vs Will-o-wisp" thread he was complaining about
the bazaar as well as about pickup groups expecting him to be decently
equipped.  As to whether I'm "itching for a fight", the obvious answer
there is that I'm usually more than willing to get into an argument.
And this particular idea, that others are obligated to accomodate your
play-style without any concern for how it impacts theirs, is way too
commonplace in EQ, from the uber-bullies steamrolling over others to
the conflicted RP snobs expecting to walk in to a pickup group and be
welcomed like Arthur Pendragon's lost cousin Fred.  I have no beef at
all with RPers who don't try to push their world on others (the
overwhelming majority of them), or ubers who don't bully others (also
a majority, sadly not nearly so overwhelming as the former group).
But this insistence that it should be your "right" to expect a spot in
a pickup group with gear that is way underpowered for your level (this
is EQ in mid-summer 2003, not EQ in mid-summer 1999, things do change),
because the bazaar offends your sensibilities is really irritating.  If
you want to exclude the player economy from your play go right ahead,
but please don't expect me to subsidize your hypocritical eccentricity
by inviting you along to sponge xp in a group you cannot make a decent
contribution to.  And no, this doesn't apply to L12s, I'm referring to
30-somethings insisting on using weapons that were marginal 3 years ago
and that sort of thing.

Oh, and one more thing.  I've been playing on Stromm since it opened,
and tho over half my gear was purchased in the bazaar, I'm wearing
nothing I couldn't have helped to get, and my two best pieces of gear
(Soulstripper and Coldain Military Wristguard) I looted myself, the
former from a kill that wiped half my group, the latter was obtained
at L46 with the help of a L1 (go go Halfling Warrior of Rallos Zek).
A lot of that "high level" gear DB is complaining about in the Bazaar
is not so high level after all.  Sharpened Flotsam, a 7/18 slasher
that would've been outright "uber" back in the old days drops off
30-something mobs in Gunthak.  The game moves on, mudflation runs
rampant (and I'll not pretend it's a good thing, at least not at the
level it runs in EQ), yesterday's "uber" is today's obsolete, and no
matter how much one might wish for "the golden age" to return it
won't (it wasn't so golden either).
