Just wondering. Did you collect the belts in the East/West Commonlands
or in Crushbone/Greater Faydark?

I don't know if it makes a difference but it may be that _Crushbone_
[Legionaire?] belts might not be the  same as the (Commonlands)
_Deathfist_  [Slashed?] belts. Hence, your inability to get them
accepted.

I have turned in Deathfist belts that I got off Deathfist orcs killed
in the Commonlands to the Freeport Captain, so that does work.
