   Bring up your bard whenever I'm online, then follow me around playing
mana song.  If Lenny is one, also play haste and slow.

  Necromancer.  A well played one is a boon to almost any group, IMO. 
And soloing?  They can do that in a pinch.

Go go Shadowknight!  A solid enough tank, Harmtouch for when you really
have to show you care, and not nearly as awful at soloing as a warrior. 
Lenny just rerolled as a SK, and no complaints.

   If really don't think you'll do bard again, seriously think of
scrapping him and coming to FV in another guise.  I say this because
there are alot of AGERs over there now, many of them lowbies.  Heck, I
think there are more there now actively than there were when we were
trying to make a guild work on Test.  If you need help transferring
stuff and a temp to get you started, just let me know.

And speaking of Test, you might want to head over there first before you
commit to any one character or server.  If you type /testbuff, any
character you have gets turned into a level 25 powerhouse, with all
(well, most) spells and fairly decent armor.  No money, but still, a
decent way to find out if the life a monk, ranger, or whatever is right
for you, at least in the low mid levels.
