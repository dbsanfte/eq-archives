Bard swarm kiting does not work by having a charmed pet do damage to a 
mob (or a dozen mobs), rather, it works on charming a mob in order to 
have the swarm do damage to him, then breaking charm and finishing him 
off yourself.

This means that the bard is doing -all- the damage to the former pet 
(since what happened to it while it was a pet doesn't count)

A better example would be druid or enchanter or even mage charm work, 
which is done extensively in places like PON.  Even though in most of 
those cases all the damage being done to the mobs that die are coming 
from charmed pet, its still far more exp per hour to have charmed pets 
kill things than it is to do the killing by traditional means.

Insofar as summoned pets, I've frequently memmed my first level spell 
burst of flame, so as to do just enough damage to get me full exp, 
without wasting the mana for a "real" nuke.  Difference between doing 
this and letting pet solo mobs all on his own (while I spend my mana on 
heals and malaise, and DS, say) is very substantial.

For a charmed pet, though, this approach would be inconsequential, 
charmed pets take exp in proportion to how much damage they do versus 
how much you do.  If they do 9,995 points of damage while you use a tiny 
nuke for 5 points (which is what is frequently happening when I solo 
with my summoned pets), then there will be almost no reduction at all in 
  how much exp they take.

I'm not clear on how much exp a charmed pet takes at best, nor on how 
much damage you have to do in order to to mitigate this loss.  The 
approach of breaking charm before the target dies will eliminate all 
loss, now if the target has only 5 hp left and you hit it with a 5 hp 
nuke, that will give you all the exp.  But this isn't really practical 
for non bards, who can get  a lot of milage out of charming a mob and 
then buffing it up and gearing it up, and who can expect charm to last 
for ten minutes or more at a time, Hours in some cases (dire charm)

ANother interesting question that I think I can answer; if you aren't 
soloing, any damage by your group counts for these two issues.  Does 
this include damage done by other people's pets?  What if at least two 
people are using charmed pets-how do they interact vis a vis exp?

Well, I've done this with summoned pets (mage and shaman), and neither 
of us have to bother with doing any nuke damage, assuming each of our 
pets do at least one point to each mob, we get all the exp; only if for 
some reason we have multiple mobs in camp and the pets work exclusively 
on seperate mobs do we need to throw in a nuke to get the full exp. 
Fail to do this and the loss is quite noticable.

I -think- charmed pets work the same way, which is to say that if two 
charmed pets are working on a given target, that each has the share of 
exp he would normally take reduced by the damage the other charmed pet does.

In a full group, a charmed pet doesn't seem to cost much exp at all, 
even though he's outdamaging each of the other members of the group, 
having 3 or 4 people working all together seems to be sufficient to 
compete.  I haven't seen groups with multiple charmed pets, but that 
seems to me an even better solution.

6 blood ravens should make short work of any mob in the entire plane of 
nightmares!
