You're not the first person to suggest this, and I won't be the first
to disagree. Just as walking through a building and sketching a floor
plan doesn't violate the architects intellectual property rights, so
do player-made maps (for example) of Norrath not violate Verant's IP
rights.

And how many do you know who are willing to foot a potentially huge
bandwidth bill each month? My humble site, with few graphics and
reasonably tight HTML moves two gigabytes a month, and the only
visitors I have are other tailors. How many gigs do you suppose the
huge sites are pushing, and what do you suppose it costs? And for the
largest sites bandwidth isn't the only concern - several of them
require multiple dedicated servers.

>Personally, I do not see this lasting.

Neither do I, but not for the same reasons. There are still sites that
are free, and many people will simply go to them instead. The sites
that charge a fee are simply going to have trouble competing.

Anyone who would complain to Verant because a previously free fan site
has started to charge a fee is a total idiot.

>He has further stated that action will soon be taken by Verant on the matter.

Uh-huh. Perhaps this is true, perhaps not. But second-hand anonymous
information posted to a Usenet newsgroup isn't exactly compelling.
