I like the Blackened Alloy stuff it is light and has decent AC. The
Blackened Alloy Long Sword (BALS) is pretty nice for lower levels and I have
seen them sell for as little as 50pp.

I always use the philosophy of the faster you kill the faster you get to
level and loot hence the more money you get to get better weapons and armor
that help you kill faster.....repeat.
