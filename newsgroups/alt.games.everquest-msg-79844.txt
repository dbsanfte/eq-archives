I tried the game for the free month and developed a serious dislike
for it.  I really really tried to like it, but couldn't.  All of my
real life friends who got me hooked on EQ in the first place made the
switch leaving me all alone in EQ.  

I was reluctant to try a PvP game after playing the eternal PK victim
in UO.

Yeah yeah, I know you don't have to go to the RVR realms if you don't
want to, but on a PVE level; EQ is simply better than DAoC imho.  The
fact that realm points, that you get from killing the enemy give you
skill boosts that aren't available to avid non-PVPers makes it clear
that Mythic's focus is on RVR, and PVE is an afterthought.

Some say DAoC looks better, I don't see it.  Visually EQ beats it in
every way in my eyes, but that's an "eye of the beholder" kinda fing.

I also hear that PVP isn't as nasty as UO was.  However, I still heard
tales of high levels jumping lower levels as soon as they stuck their
head out the gate, corpse camping, etc.  I even heard one of my EQ
friends bragging that he can mez other players and then taunt them
with emotes before killing them.  PVP just brings out a side of people
that I'd rather not see.

That in my mind is DAoC's biggest mistake.  Leveling really slowed
down after 20, and my friends still playing it say 40 is much much
worse.  Their biggest draw is a unique brand of PVP where combatants
can't talk to each other.  It seems like a good idea, and who knows,
if I had tried it, I might have enjoyed it.  

But lets face it.  By now, you have level 50s running around, so if
you go to the RVR area less than level 40 ~ 45, you're going to get
spanked hard.

It came down to "do I want to pay for the privalege of experiencing
boring XP camps for another month so I can be big enough to try out
PVP, which I've had bad experiences with in the past?"

The answer was a resounding "heck no!".

They should have made it more like UO, where you can max out a
competent PVP character in a week or so.

They're trying to draw customers with so many un-EQ like features, but
they still make you go through the dull XP camps before you can try it
out.  

Heck, I reached the ripe old level of 20 and was finally big enough to
kill rats and ants.   /chuckle
