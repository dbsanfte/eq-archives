Well, I could live with necro's getting it, being a serious pet class as
well, and *maybe* with SK's and Shammies, but Enchanters?
<rant>
Come ON! those guys have the worst pets in the game. NO control whatsoever,
which makes them more dangerous to the enchanter himself then to the mob
attacking him (no control = no mez). I only see soloing enchanters use pets
and if a soloer can't keep his pet with him he *should* die to the train due
to his incompetence.
</rant>

I think this has been added to level the field for Beastmasters, which, I
suppose, also get this spell. I really fear the Beastmaster though. If he
(the beastmaster) gets varying pets with different skills as well as decent
melee stats the mage might become an almost redundant class. Especially with
the Call of the Hero nerfed for saving clerics the mage gets less and less
use for end-game encounters (which I'm really looking forward to).
