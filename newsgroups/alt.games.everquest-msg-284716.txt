If you need more room, you can probably shorten that to

/g incoming %t
/pause 5, /autofire
/autofire

Pause can be put on the same line as another command, although the 
syntax is counterintuitive, as it looks like the pause would happen 
before the command.  What really happens is the command starts and the 
pause, which is wait before trying the next command, starts at the same 
time, I guess.
