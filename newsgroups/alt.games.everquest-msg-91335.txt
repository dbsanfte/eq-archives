Every time the Sleeper is mentioned, we hear the same complaints about 
Primal being so much harder to get.  I'm going to assume that Primal is 
about the best you -can- get from the people who get uptight about it not 
dropping as much with Warders 1-4 being gone.

Did Luclin add any high level armor and weapons that outclass the highest 
Original / Kunark / Velium drops?  I know there are nice low and mid-levl 
drops, but I haven't heard any Wooting over the new Uber stuff.

Also, I'm going to assume that Luclin has been fully explored.  Is the 
high-end content there enough to pull the Ubers away from the standard Uber 
spots ( pre-Luclin )?  If I do a "/ all cleric 60" I don't notice too much 
of a shift in locations from the pre-Luclin era.  Is this because people 
are sheep or are there no new end-game spots ( that have been found )?
