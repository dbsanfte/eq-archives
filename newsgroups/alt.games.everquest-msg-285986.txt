So even though the Sony online store lists the Anniversary Edition
as "coming soon!", I was able to find it in a local store and have
picked up copies for my two accounts.  This is how I figured I'd
add the last two expansions for $20 per account, seemed fine to me!

But now I'm wondering how I do that?  Nothing in the box says how
to use the account key.  If I installed from scratch I guess it
would ask for the key at some point, but here I inserted the first
disk, and it dutifully ran the installer and asked for all 8 disks
and copied the files into my folder (which I've backed up, of
course!), and now the patcher is re-fetching all the patches that
have happened since these CDs were written.  I figure sure, it's a
fine excuse for doing a fresh install, and I've got the old folder
if something goes wrong.  But meanwhile I'm still wondering at what
point in the process I'll be given a chance to use the product key
to open up the latest expansions?

I guess when it finishes patching I'll see what the screen looks
like that keeps asking me if I want to buy more expansions, and
whether the Anniversary Edition product key will work for both
expansions or only for new accounts.
