I do that with my mage.  I keep hitting my 'bash' button then remembering 
that isn't 'bash' anymore.  I should make it sense heading, at least then 
it'd be of some use *g*

Hmm - haven't ever *not* been able to get away from anything yet with 
just a sow and lev on.  Gate takes too long to cast and is usually 
interrupted.

> You seem a little too fond of levitate

:..( but I'm FLYING.  Okay fine, I AM fond of lev.  I LOVE lev. :)  It's 
like... no more walking over a hill to find a sand giant and a big-ass 
club waiting for you, because you can see him before you get there.  No 
more risk of killing yourself by 'falling' down hills because you're so 
near-dead that the 11HP loss did the trick and saved that mob that's 
after you the trouble.

But yes, I do switch it back and forth. Serpent sight, bind, cure 
disease/poison, that kind of thing.  But I use the others so little that 
I usually end up with lev memmed.
