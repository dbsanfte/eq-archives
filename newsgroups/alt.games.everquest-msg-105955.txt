Talk to a ranger.  Rangers get *zero* defense increases between level 40 and
level 50.  It's *quite* apparent that level directly affects your damage
taking ability.  It's also *quite* apparent that defense increases do the
same.  And equally *quite* apparent that while both are a benefit, they are
*separate* benefits.

Oh well, do your own thing.  You remind me of the "black pearl crowd".

In this game, levels > all.

Thing is, you could easily make your tests consistent and eliminate or
"prove" my "levels > all" contention.  But you choose not to.  I know what
that tells me.
