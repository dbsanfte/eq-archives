I honestly don't see anything wrong with this. 

This is how the boards were before:

PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, 
PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, HEY PLEASE CONTRIBUTE!
PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, 
PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, HEY PLEASE CONTRIBUTE!
PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, 
PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, HEY PLEASE CONTRIBUTE!
PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, 
PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, PLEASE CONTRIBUTE, HEY PLEASE CONTRIBUTE!

This is how the boards are now:

Some single my super sales add banner.

I see it as an improvement really. Before it was the oddest thing,
someone running a webboard and expecting other people to give them
money for it, begging all the damn time. I hope Yantis buys some more
boards so I don't have to see that begging crap anymore.
God that got old.

If you can't afford a damn board, don't have one.
