I am sure it is similar to other "newbie" armor that has been added to
other starting cities. As long as you gather the right components you
should never fail when "combining" them to make the armor. If the
quests are setup like the halfling ones you should be able to complete
the quests by level 10-11 solo and without outside aid.
