[cross-post on sony-station message board technical help]

I have experienced one version of this problem with the S3 Savage/IX
display chip under Win2000sp2 and DirectX 8.0a.  Going to full screen
mode, either through F10 or at start-up with the eqclient.ini
parameter ScreenMode set equal to FULL, OR changing the DISPLAY mode
[from any resolution to any resolution] causes the OS to reboot via
the blue-screen of death.  This is, of course, after logging-in and
selecting my character.

EQtech responded to my request for help with a message that stated
that the problem was common to users of the following video cards: ATI
Rage Pro, S3 Savage 4, 3dfx Voodoo, and Diamond Stealth s540.  They
recommend updating to the latest drivers, and that for the S3, the
driver version should be .035.

I did upgrade to the latest drivers - updated in May 2001 - from
www.s3graphics.com, and still reboot on entering full-screen mode in
EQ.  BTW, I couldn't find any drivers at www.s3graphics.com or
www.savagenews.com for the Savage/IX that had a version ending in
.035.

The below post at alt.games.everquest claims that a GM stated that the
latest patch dropped support for S3 chips.  This doesn't seem to be
supported by VI's efforts to fix the problem.

According to the Everquest web site, S3 chips are supported for
Everquest, including Kunark and Velious.  Also, they claim to write to
the DirectX API, and not for any particular chip.  Our machine passes
the three DirectX tests for Display in DXdiag, and did so before and
after upgrading the drivers.  So, we should be working just fine.  But
we're not.

I did try the suggestions by Brodder_FoamyMugs in the sony-station
technical help message board, including increasing the paging file
size to 384 MB initial and 768 MB maximum on each of two drives - this
exceeds the 650MB recommendation.  I eliminated the four suggested
files [I believe that the correct names are eqclient.ini, dbg.txt,
eqdevice.txt and AudioDbg.txt] and the thourough file checks on main,
optional, kunark and velious patches.

I have a PIII/844MHz and 128MB RAM with disks that are each less than
10% full and defragged weekly using Diskeeper 6.

The bottom-line is that up until the May 30 patch, EQ with Kunark and
Velious worked fine with our compliant set-up.  Now it doesn't.  We
didn't purchase a new update to the game that advanced the start of
the art beyond our video capabilities, the game designer "patched" the
current version and broke our paid-in-full license.  I think that all
of us should expect a fix, and soon, and even a rebate for the days
since May 30 that we can't exercise our license and subscription.

I will send this newer information to EQtech in response to their
response to my support request.

With any luck, the situation will be fixed soon.  Thanks to all for
their support in this forum.
