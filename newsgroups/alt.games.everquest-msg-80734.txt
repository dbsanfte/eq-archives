My experience for dungeon groups, 50+

You need a cleric.
You need an enchanter. If you can't get one, a bard 52+ will do for
most camps.
You need a main tank--warrior or SK. Paladin will do in a pinch.
You need an evac--druid or wizard. Druids are a dime a dozen.
Some camps need a rogue to get to.
EVERYONE ELSE gets to fight over the sixth slot.

I know that there would be a change in strategy, but I really think
that two changes that VI could make that would greatly increase the
variety and playability of EverQuest would be (1) 8 person groups and
(2) linked groups for XPs.
