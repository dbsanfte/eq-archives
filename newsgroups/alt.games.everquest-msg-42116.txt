Amen brother. I hated, hated , hated to see level 5 monks running around
with fighting batons when I was lv 24 and still couldn't afford one. Now
however, I don't think I can put up with the hassle it takes for a new char
to earn anything decent. My last char I created was a rogue that had over a
100 hitpoints and 87 ac at lv 1. Man , did it make life easier. Foreman's
skull cap, walrus tooth,Crystal Fiber, drake hide leggings, ulthork gloves,
Foreman's tunic, a nice shield till he gets duel wield, and other nice
stuff.. I would deliberately stand there and draw a crowd of mobs and just
take them out one after another. Levels 1 to 5 flew by.

Dominic, the unabashed twinker,

(I'm sorry, I just can't help myself. I really hate trying to auction stuff
to players)
