Ok I have a slight problem
#1 I have a Barbarian Shammy who needs to buy spells from the Qeynos mage
guild, but the folks there REALLY don't like him.  He can't even do the
Neclo quest, to raise faction and handing in the yard trash to Ms.
Herblender only seems to yield a response along the lines of "I don't like
you nor trust you enough to help us on this matter"
Gnolls and Teeth don't seem to work on this faction either as I am
Kindly/Warmly to ALL the merchants in Qeynos except for these guys who I am
still /conning Dubious to.

#2 I do have a Human Mage, I brought him back from Freeport to Qeynos to buy
this spell for my Shammy and i noticed something Odd while passing through
the gates of his home city (Qeynos).
Lashun Novashine Aggro'd him.  Thats right something I did messed up my
priest of life faction to the point of me being KoS to anyone who worships
the Flying Saucer.
So WTF could I have done to mess that faction up?  Hell 5 lvls ago I had
enough faction to kill the Kolandi Fish swimming in the pool and hand the
remains in for a Band of Rodcet Nife.
    I have done 0 evil quests and have spent the last 5 lvls doing nothing
but Killing Orcs in Freeport and killing Dervs in Nro and WC.  Are these UFO
fanatics aligned with the common criminal element of Norrath? Or am I
missing something vital here?
Sincerely
Morpain 15th lvl Mage Ayonae Ro
Wizeone 9th lvl Shaman Ayonae Ro

p.s. I eventually had to hire 2 diffrent newbies to get the spell, the first
ran off with my cash.
