Post a config. What driver versions on what devices. what IRQ's are
they using (hint hint) and the like. I bet you have an IRQ share
between your AGP port and a critical device. AGP ain't supposed to
really use that IRQ, but can grab it if it has to emulate D3D on older
games (Like EQ). Wouldn't surprise me if your connection device
(modem/NIC) is sharing with the AGP slot. Or that it is on IRQ9. 9 is
bad, bothing should use it if it can be avoided.
