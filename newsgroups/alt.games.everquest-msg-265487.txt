The question was about the Shadow Haven casino, which is supplied as
part of the game.  I believe it's still there, and that the odds of
winning something useful are quite low; it's designed to suck money
out of the game, after all.

The Bazaar casino(s) are run by players, who make up some numbers for
the payouts.  Usually they get their math right so they have an edge.
I've never bothered trying one of them, but I assume for the most part
they're honest games, i.e. if you get a winning roll they will pay you
and not simply /quit with your money.  Don't really know, since I'm
not willing to play a game where the odds are against me to start with
AND I risk the player refusing to pay even if I win.

I do wish there were a way to turn off the /random messages for my
bazaar mule.  I guess SOE doesn't want to let you "/filter random"
because people might leave it turned off and that could lead to a
mess when they're in a group using /random to hand out loot.  I can
see it already:

Main_Looter_01 tells the group, "Grats Bob!"
Slimy_Weasel_01 tells the group, "Wait! I had /random filtered off
 and didn't see the roll! You'll have to roll it over."
