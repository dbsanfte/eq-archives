I could care less about whether 42 is annoyed or not - most of his
posts I've ever read were a waste of bandwidth to begin with.  He's
only not KF'd now because Xnews defaults to letting people out in
100 days.

Sidekicking boosts your level to 1 under the sidekicker's level -
which boosts your HP, acc and def as well as the effectiveness
of your powers - but doesn't give you access to new powers.  Is
that an accurate summation?  Just like leveling without going to
see Ms. Liberty.
