You have got EQ down to the letter.

Two things.

First, I did not get nor did I feel like I "got a spanking" for anything
that I have said.  People that understand issues beyond their own patriotic
fervor understand what I said to be only the DOCUMENTED truth about WHY
there are Palestinian terrorists. Not a word from me said or implied that I
supported them....ever  So thats just more of your bullshit in an attempt to
dodge the valid questions that I posed and you failed to answer.

Second, Not ONE fact that I have mentioned in the past posts have been
effectivley challenged. Its still all true.  If you think winning is
changing the question and calling "terrorist" then your just as fucked up as
I thought you were.   I think I won  that little argument hands down because
not ONE person here could explain away that Isreal has already been found
guilty beyond ANY doubt for the last 50 years according to international
law. All I got was stupid accusations that I supported terrorism..and
history from 200BC.

Even though you are a fucking idiot, I will say once AGAIN...as I have every
single post from the beginning.  I do not support terrorists nor do I agree
with their methods. I also do not support the Ultra right wing government of
Isreals illegal occupation of Palestine (as documented ad-nauseum in the
United Nations history of the issue....Try reading that).  I just understand
WHY there are terrorists.

Your opinions, to me, are those of both a lunatic and a man with no honor
EQ...so they mean nothing at all. Its just funny to watch you bark. You're
virtually the only one in this NG that does not think that you are totally
insane and a total crooked bastard.  If I was as universally hated,
emotionally disturbed, morally challenged and just plain fucked up as you, I
would end it all.  lol

Heres another little disturbing fact for you.  I long ago filtered your
posts out and have not laid eyes on anything you have said at all until
today (I installed a new OS on my net PC yesterday and did not set up
filtering yet) As for the Israeli thing..I stopped responding...with the
same unchallenged facts as always..when it became a shitfight.

I'm not going to reply to any off-topic posts..especially yours.  You're a
loser, liar, thief and, if some are to be believed, a child molestor.  Not
worth my time faggot.

Have a nice life.
