> So your telling me at 50+ you have done all there is?

  I personally have never played a character past 42, but I do know there
are people who have seen and done pretty much all there is to do.

  And even though I haven't seen and done everything, the expansion gives me
new options (or will give me new options, when I buy it).  The option to
play a Vah Shir or beastlord, the option to explore new lower/mid level
areas.  New options equipment-wise for my current characters.

  I also look forward to the overall improvement in the look and feel of
things.  I have been wanting 3D armor for a while now instead of the
skintight deals that we've been limited to previously.

  None of that excites you?  Good, that's $30 you don't have to spend.  You
do have to stomach the 24-48 hours of downtime, but it is petty to complain
about that when you know there are thousands of people out there for whom
the expansion will add many WEEKS and MONTHS worth of new entertainment.
