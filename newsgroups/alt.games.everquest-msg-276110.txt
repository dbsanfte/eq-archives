Anyone feel as is there is a serious lack of equipment in the game? I was 
browsing the broker the other day and there was simply nothing that I 
wanted. Where is all the really cool stuff? Everyone seems to have the same 
armour and items, I can spot another Ranger straightway as we all look 
exactly the same.

It's kinda disapointing that there isnt more equipment in the game. Was EQ1 
like this at the beginning, is it different now? I was expecting everyone to 
look kinda unique with different armour. As it is now each class looks the 
same.

As a lvl 24 Ranger I want a choice of 10-20 bows, not 1 or 2. I want a huge 
array of armour sets that I can combine to create a unique look.

Anyone feel the same way?
