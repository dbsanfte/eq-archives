Dood, very good point!  Major bonus of NPC pets, there.  So only thing
remaining is to have a plan for if roamers get close by any means.  With
rogue-heavy group they won't turn but other can turn.

Last point here is the key is to maximize exp.  That means as low downtime
as possible, as high level kill as possible, and as fast a kill as possible.
With so many pets they would be taking exp when they get kills.  (grouped
experience with pets works that way).
