What I (or you) think is irrelevant. Verant owns the game, they do
what they wish.

I think you'll find it difficult to point to anyone who says these
names "destroy their enjoyment". "Detracts from" would be far more
accurate.

And since the names of NPCs are not covered by the rules, this name
doesn't constitute a violation.

"but I thought I'd see if I could start another fight about it".
