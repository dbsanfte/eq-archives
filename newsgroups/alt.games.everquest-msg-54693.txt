First off, let's keep the rumors consistent:

1.  It is NOT a rumor that Nixx the Insane Mofo Shaman on the Test
Server soloed Yeldema.  The screenshots were posted on the shaman
board.

2.  No necro ever soloed Vox.  Infact, NO ONE has ever soloed Vox.
The least number I know for certain to kill Nagafen was 11 people
pre-Kunark (yes, PRE-KUNARK).

3.  The "rumor" of a level 60 warrior + level 60 cleric using Donal's
BP was against Naggy and it's a hard to believe rumor given the AoEs
that Naggy has.

See above about Nixx.
