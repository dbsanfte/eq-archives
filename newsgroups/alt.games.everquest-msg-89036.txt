Its nice to have monsters that chase you, regardless of low hp. that way
they stay clumped together.
Try kitties on OT... getting 4 of them may be troublesome tho.
Theres also lots of good stuff in BW. Hornets and skellies will always chase
you. I just quadded the hornets myself, but they might be a bit tough at 40.
Youd probably be limited to ash hornets, and that would be hard before lvl
44ish.
Raptors in TD are another popular place, but I dont have personal experience
of this.
Bloodgill goblins in loio are about as hard a BB dwarves. You have to pull
them from underwater, so this is maybe a bit tricky.
The most popular spot would be the wyverns in CS, but I expect you want to
be 49+ to attempt them... probably higher. You really need to fix your CoV
faction to make this a pleasant experience (Kill velious giants. Follow a
guild raid into kael and get the faction hits if you're in a hurry)
