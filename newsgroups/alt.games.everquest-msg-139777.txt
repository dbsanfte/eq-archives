"A Crazy Newbie"
>Any thoughts on eye strain and LCD vs CRT?

LCD Positives:

Much easier on the eyes.

Looks *great*.

DVD movies look gorgeous.


LCD Negatives:

Can't get higher resolutions - often limited to 1024x768 or 1280x1024

Games with a lot of fast movement will often look blurry.  (EQ should be
fine though.)

$$$$$$$.   Bucks upon bucks.

See if you can get an in-store demo of a game being played on an LCD screen.
Usually they only play DVD movies on these screens - there's a reason for
that.  =)  Ask them to let you try Unreal or something like it on the screen
and run around a lot.

Me, I've had the same 17" CRT monitor for six years now - no complaints.
Just make it a point to take a couple of minutes each hour to focus on
something other than the screen and you should be fine.
