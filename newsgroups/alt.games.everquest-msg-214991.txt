    You have a decent grasp of the english language, and it looks like can
type.

    That puts you ahead of about 50% of pickup groupers right there. I'm
detecting the taint of at least a vague intelligence too... wham you're
ahead of 80%. Were I you, my primary concern would not be causing the death
of others but the reverse...

    I'm not sure where you get the idea that EQ is full of lethal EQ experts
who know the game and their class backwards, have read every little trick in
the book and practised every possible tactic on every possible camp. Maybe
these people exist, but I can assure you they don't form the majority of
pickup group members. In fact if you just reverse most of that
description...

Cheers,
James
