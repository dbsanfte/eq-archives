Yes, that's a viable plan. The merchant who sells them is in SolA and is on some
sort of gnome faction (gemchoppers, maybe?)  I know you can bring faction with
him up by killing kobolds in SolB. Anyway, they cost about 5.5k to 6k depending
on how well he likes you. The only advantage of Jboots of Tboots, aside from the
fact that Jboots can be camped and Tboots are expensive, is that Jboots cast
instantly, meaning you can get the spell off no matter what. Tboots have a short
casting time.
