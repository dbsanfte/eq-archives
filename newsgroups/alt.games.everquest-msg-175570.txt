Has anyone else had a problem like this. When I have selected my server and
click 'Play EverQuest', it brings up the loading screen. Then, randomly it
would seem as it happens at one of two possible sites in the loading
process, and only sometimes when loading, my internet connection gets cut (I
hear the modem hang up). I'm on 56K Dialup. I either get disconnected when
the loading bar is 100% complete or around 65%, never earlier. It has only
started happening since I installed PoP....It's very annoying since not
having a particularly amazing computer loading takes long enough as it is,
and now I have to do it multiple times on some occasions :*( When the
discon. happens, naturally EQ crashes to desktop as a new dial up window
pops up, although the new EQ Window ability has reduced this happening
greatly

Any ideas as to what this happens or how to prevent it. I've searched the
Knowledge base etc and no luck :/
