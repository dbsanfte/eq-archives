the beastlord haste and regen wont land on a level 11. I dont know if it was
meant to be that way or a bug. but beastlords dont get these spells untill
much higher in their life and for some reason it trips the code that only
allows things to land on people over 45. infusion of spirit wont land
either, altho a shaman can cast it on a level 1 just fine.
