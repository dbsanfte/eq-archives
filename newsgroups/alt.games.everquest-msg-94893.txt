You are correct.

If it bothers you for very long after you quite playing, try ice on
your wrist and anti-inflamatory OTC drugs.  You are likely resting
your arm's weight on a part of your wrist and insulting the nerve. 
Here's the digs:

Your carpal tunnel carries only part of the nerve fibers that
innervate your hand.  As you mentioned from the middle of the right
through the index finger.  The pinky and other half of your ring
finger are supplied by a nerve that runs outside the carpal tunnel. 
What we do know is that the problem is in your wrist.  Try resting
your wrist on something soft when possible, or rest your forearm on
something that lets your hand dangle over the mouse.

Your nerve or the tissues around it become inflamed and pinch it. 
Step one is to treat the inflamation.  Step two is to stop resting on
the same area for hours on end.

Of course, you could also play less EQ, but I know that's not an
option...
