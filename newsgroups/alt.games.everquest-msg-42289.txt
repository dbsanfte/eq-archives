I've been playing EQ for over two years now. If you think my initial
fifty bux paid for over two years worth of my share of a 3 Gigabit net
connection, plus my share of the upkeep of a server farm of well over a
thousand boxes, plus initial development costs, plus development costs
of all the free additional content (besides the commercial expansions),
I think you'll find you are rather wrong.

But all that is beside the point... If you don't like the situation,
don't play EQ and save the money. Besides masturbation, there is no form
of free entertainment you are *entitled* to. Free content is a
privilege, not a right. I'll enjoy it while it's there, and mourn it
when it's gone, but I'm not going to bitch and moan about it.
