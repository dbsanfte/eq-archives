Just thinking about how the wait time ruins the dungeon experience (umm,
yah, pun intended...), and what if they made something that would group for
you?  If you clicked on auto-group, it would select the first 5 matches and
fling you into a dungeon.  They would have to adjust it to eliminate 6
ranger groups, etc... but I'm sure they could come up with a balance
somehow.  Maybe you could mark people as dungeon friends and it would know
you approved of them as group mates and would give them preference over
others.  Team vs Team pvp in a dungeon, winning team gets some exp?
