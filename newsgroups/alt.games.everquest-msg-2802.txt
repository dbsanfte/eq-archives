None really, the game is not set up to encourage it so most people
simply don't bother much. So much downtime and angst and camping (even
if you do your best to relieve, not have such things) makes players
jaded too soon from my experience. 

Everyone is too busy to hang out in towns or something and roleplay.
The inns and taverns and the theater of tranquility are empty. This
was kinda funny the other day some guy in my guild was saying things
which he thought would promote roleplaying and almost all of them
ALREADY WERE IN THE GAME. I sarcastically mentioned "yeah, or like
some stage or theater in freeport" and the guy went "YEAH! ; ) " the
fact that I was being sarcastic and it already existed being lost on
this 52 level player evidently.

That being said maybe there are some more than others and they are the
ones those other people mentioned like morrel thule and quellious.
No server is designated as an rp one by verant, nor ever will be
probably and if one was it would have no effect on how people
eventually played anyway. But that is a topic for a whole other big
long thread with lots of arguing.
