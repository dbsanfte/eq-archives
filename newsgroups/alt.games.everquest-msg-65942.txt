This is true, but probably not as cost effective....And I think most people
would have moved to EQ2 pretty quickly....But this brings up a good point,
given the CHOICE I bet a good percentage of the people complaining about
being FORCED to upgrade would not be complaining and would probably run out
and upgrade......If people spend all the time and energy finding a way of
getting win98 instead of complaining about not being able to use win95, it
would be a non-issue...Win98 is $10-$50 on ebay....and if someone can't
afford that, then they can't afford the monthly EQ fee, anyway....And if
you're a kid I'd imagine MOST parents that are willing to pay for a monthly
gaming fee will probably pay for an OS upgrade, if not, hey mow some
lawns...wash some cars...ask Santa...I don't know....
