Hi,
I currently run two copies of Everquest (original) on two PCs that are 
old enough that they have only an AGP slot, no PCI Express capability.
I've started thinking/planning building a new PC and I'm hoping to run my 
two Everquest copies on one PC.
I understand about installing the two copies in two separate directories, 
and my questions and concerns have mostly to do with the required 
horsepower of the CPU and graphics card(s).
Starting with the graphics card, I'm looking at this one:
>>EVGA GeForce 9600 GT 01G-P3-N869-AR Video Card EVGA 01G-P3-N869-AR 
GeForce 9600 GT 1GB 256-bit GDDR3 PCI Express 2.0 x16 HDCP Ready SLI 
Supported Video Card <<
I'd need a motherboard with a PCI Express 2.0 slot.
Would I be able to run two displays off this single card, or do I need to 
get two of them and run them in SLI mode?
For the motherboard, I haven't narrowed the search down yet, but I lean 
toward AMD rather than Intel and I'm thinking that I will need about 2GB 
of memory per copy of Everquest and another 1-2 GB for Vista.
Feedback would be appreciated.
