Old topic, but I keep a text file handy for cut/paste  :)   

1. Download the latest firmware from Linksys and install. 
http://www.linksys.com/download/     I am now at 1.42.7 
 
2. In the router configuration pages, click on the Advanced tab, and
on 
the Filters page, scroll down and disable both SPI and Block WAN
Request.  
Then click on Apply at the bottom.   Your router will reset. 
 
3. Click on the Forwarding tab at the top, then on the Port Triggering

button in about the middle of the page.  In the port triggering panel,

for the name field, put EverQuest.  For the triggering port range
enter 
1024 to 7000.   For the Incoming port range enter 1024 to 7000. 
Click on apply. 
 
I don't know if it's necessary, but after this I rebooted.
