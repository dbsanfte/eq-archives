From the shadows, the mysterious "Lumpy2" <malkiv11@edelphia.net> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Better hope they're not porting over the latest version on test. Right
now we're struggling with all tank classes currently being utterly
unable to gain or hold aggro at all, in any way. No aggro spell of sk
or paladin is working for aggro, nor is enraging blow. :-)

Made for some "interesting" raid complications. Emp ssra becomes
somewhat less of a chump when your MT gets no aggro at all and no one
can control the spites.
