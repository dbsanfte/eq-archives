Oh sure, my level 42 druid had fun soloing that damned Grimfeather...but it
was equally as fun getting revenge on DVinn at 30 or Dorn at 25.

Helping newbies with buffs and heals or an occasional low-value (to me) item
(but NEVER EVER to anyone who ASKS for stuff) is one of my favorite things
about the game and I was able to do that very well at level 20 with my
druid.  In fact, at level 49 I can't do much more for them.  My damage
shield would SLOW THEM DOWN in leveling (24 damage is enough to kill a
critter...and if the newbie misses with his first hit <likely> the critter
just disappears with no xp awarded) and his better heal is wasted on a
newbie.
