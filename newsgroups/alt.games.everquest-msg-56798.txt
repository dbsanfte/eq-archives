I played on Tallon Zek for about an hour last night, after the player
monster
update, and I can say that I don't like it a bit, except for the occasional
slaughtering of a grief player.

For low level characters, this change is going to make leveling damn near
impossible.

The problems I see with it:

1) the mobs tend to gang up on players, especially newbies.  And they can
cause XP loss if they gang up with NPCs.  And there's no way to petition
that.
2) they have unlimited aggro range, which compells you to watch the behavior
of *every* mob, trying to determine if it's a PC or NPC.
3) they use more advanced movement tactics to evade the player
4) they can stay out of range of a player without SoW and run to an
    area, trying to train you onto NPCs.
5) They have ridiculous attacks, like a scorpion that can kick!  Yeah,
right.

and worst of all:

6) There's really no punishment for being a grief player.  Even if they die,
they get another character to harrass someone else.  It's not like a regular
player where people will gang up on you and hunt you down and kill you
over and over till you learn your lesson.

If they keep this change on Tallon Zek, I will play there no longer.  It
is a shame because I have three characters there that I'm rather attached
to.

I don't know what they could do to fix it.  Some ideas that might help a
little:

Limit the PC's that player mobs can attack to stuff that's only 2 levels
below
them and above.

If they score points on a player character that dies and loses XP, they
don't get
to play another monster for at least one day. -or- the character that dies
doesn't
lose XP.  I think I like the first idea better...  punish them.

Limit the vision of a player mob to its normal aggro range.  Scorpions
normally
have a 0 aggro range, so there'd have to be some adjustment, of course.


In any case, I'm not playing there again till this is fixed in a good way,
or preferably
removed completely.

Fortunately, I do have characters on blue servers.

I think it's interesting how they probably made this change to attract more
people
to the PvP servers.  In fact, what it will do is cause fewer players to
start characters
on these servers, leading to a slow downward spiral in the number of PCs.
Eventually.
it will be just a server of mobs fighting mobs... like a huge bar room
brawl.
No rhyme or reason.
