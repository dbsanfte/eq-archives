There's an easy way to keep this from happening: leave one skellie up.
Xilinov spawns when all skellies are dead.  He's on a timer, though, so if
he's been killed in the past day (or two or three, not sure exactly), then
killing all the skellies won't spawn him.  If you stay there long enough,
though, clearing all skellies will cause him to come floating in to see
who's been killing his pets.  He doesn't spawn *instead* of the Taskmaster;
I've seen both Xilinov and the Taskmaster up while my pally stood cowering
in a corner, out of aggro range.  I then saw Xilinov haste and rune the
Taskmaster and all the respawning skellies, and I decided now would be a
good time to camp.

After that I always left one skellie up and never saw him again.  Marrtuk
has since moved past EC down to LGuK (again).  Still, while the skellies
were dark blue, that TM camp was by far the fastest, easiest, safest solo XP
I could get.
