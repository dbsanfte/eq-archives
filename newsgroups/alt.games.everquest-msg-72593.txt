Fear kiting in WW is extremely dangerous.
You have roaming dragons which are as fast as the fastest SoW and will
aggro if you are attacking even non-factioned mobs like velium hounds
(which are the only animal mobs in that zone).  These dragons have
HUGE aggro ranges and chain aggro of practically half the zone can be
fairly common.

Not to mention the pathing problems and warping potential in that zone
is pretty impressive.

Not really.
Maidens, and The Grey will have blue cons available up to level 60.
But virtually nothing in those zones are animals with the possible
exception of some wolves in Maidens (the spectral ones are marked as
undead and the vampire bats are definately undead).

Ranger soloing slows down signficantly at around level 55 simply
because the number of available animal mobs (and/or reasonably safe
fear kiting areas) is very small.
