not all nostalgia, but i do think it's more psychological than otherwise...

i felt the same way you feel now...though i do want to say, i feel LDoN was
a decent remedy (not here, lower down...)

but that's just it, it IS still there with all the 'fun' - you may choose to
ignore certain things, as other players (can i get some info on the a.g.e.
guild that is rejecting non-core elements? point me to it? i'm lazy =) heh)
have done and are doing, and then you'd have the same situation

and before my next point, i want to say that i also had more fun at the
beginning and middle than at the end, just as you feel

i want to ask - did you reach a "higher" level before PoP? if you haven't,
then i can see these things interrupting your game

if you had, then you would have certainly been more receptive to new content

and another thing, wouldn't you need lots of people to play on this neutered
server with you for it to be any fun? and i mean, a lot? i played on fennin,
one of the oldest servers, and it was always crowded when i was leveling
up...and then when the zones emptied, all my recapturing experiments failed,
and the empty zones didn't help

to wrap up, i would like to tell a likely-to-be overly detailed story about
what i did before i quit in the hope that this example will make all the
points of this post at once:

i was in a position very much like the one you're in, and i wanted to go
back and have the fun i used to have, but i realized a few things and came
up with my own solutions for them -

 i would prefer a regular group to having to /lfg, because waiting around
lfg sucks

i knew i had too much experience, in general, to wear blinders and pretend i
was having fun

i was stupidly rich and didn't want to have to pretend to not be

in short, as a verteran player, i had to figure out how to be true to myself
and the position i was in while also trying to make a journey to a place i
had already been

i twinked myself out hardcore, spent the whole time fighting the perfect
yellow and red mobs, and i teamed up with the 2 best players i knew, who i
had finally convinced to start newbies ... we agreed to play in old zones
when we could, to do the hardest possible things where the liklihoods of
success were never certain

occaisionally we met same-level players, and 9/10 of them were doing the
same thing we were doing ... and the remaining 1/10 were either poor enough
to look like true newbies, or actual newbies ... and we played with other
people to get that 'x' factor of groupmates you didn't know but had to trust
to succeed

and why didn't it work?

we knew exactly where we were going - straight to the top - best gear,
flawless tactics ...  it was only a matter of time

so it wasn't fun

i was wrong in my experiment; the game does not scale its lowlevel
difficulty well enough (i would have liked to gain all my experience as a
lvl 20 by killing things that were lvl 30+, even if it took 15 minutes per
mob, so long as i was rewarded fairly...i wasn't, so i had to prey on
trivial mobs that were 5 levels over me)

you would have to destroy everything you own and then find a way to forget
everything you know in order to be challenged

or ... what is painfully obvious ... play a new game since this one isn't as
fun anymore

and if you really want to enjoy the new one, take a year off from MMO's ;)

you can still do the old quests...know what i miss? testament of vaneer ...
best quest ever: travel, assassination, shady card games, gambling, swimming
(eh, fuck swimming, actually), conspiring, test of patience (starshine never
made you camp long, don't whine)
