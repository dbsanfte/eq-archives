Not necessarily. But I find the game can be too inaccessible, difficult,
and demanding. The herculean effort you have to put in just to survive
is an affront. The combat isn't particularly satisfying. Travel is a
dangerous chore. It's repetitive. The interface is clumsy. The controls
are not intuitive. The class structure and group make-up are too rigid.

You hear repeatedly of people bemoaning the game, and stating that the
only thing keeping them there is the people. The Vision makes working
with other people essential. As you get to know and care about these
people, it gets harder and harder to leave them behind when you begin to
tire. People realise the forced nature of this relationship, and begin
to resent the way the game is. Eventually they snap, say goodbye, and
leave with a bitter taste in their mouth. 

I think that's pretty cynical on behalf of Verant. Keeping customers
paying is their priority. I am amenable to correction though.
