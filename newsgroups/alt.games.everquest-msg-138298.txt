Processor speed is not that important.  I noticed a huge difference when I
was running a Pentium MMX 200MHz, and upgraded nothing but my video card.  I
now have a 800MHz P-III, and will not be upgrading that for a while.  I will
be looking at a GeForce4, not the MX.  Make sure you have plenty of ram, I
have 768MB.  So long as you have a decent P-III or better, you will
definitely benefit from a good video card.  I don't personally have any
experience with the Radeon 7000.
