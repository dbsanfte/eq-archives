Yes, as a LEATHER class they tank ok.  Of course no where near the 
ability of plate tank *of equal gear*.  Which is what most people ignore 
when they see beastlords tanking.

I tank better than the beastlords who are geared at my level, and worse 
than the ones in raid gear from a few expansions beyond me.  But then, 
I've watched mages tank better than me if they're wearing good enough gear.
