You can't tell with ShowEQ which bears have HQ pelts, nor can you tell
how much coin a mob has.  You can tell which wisps have GLSes and
which do not (can't tell whether the ones that don't have an LS or a
burned out LS, though).

The server only tells the client about mob loot that is wielded or
worn by the mob.  Wisps wield their lightstones, so the client is told
about them.

I believe the way that it was verified that pickpocketing comes from
the same pool as dropped coin is by experiment.
