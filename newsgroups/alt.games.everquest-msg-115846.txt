This is the crux of why I quit my druid.  Because I was constantly being
put into positions where my niceness was being judged.  I like to help
people. In real life, accomodating someone who comes to me for assistance
is very important for me. 

So as a druid, I want to help everyone who asks me for it.  Result?
Burnout.  Started a new char that can in no way buff or help others, so
that my niceness no longer has to be put on the line every time someone
needs a buff. 

Everquest suddenly became a LOT more fun.  :)  Well, except that my new
Karana worshipping half-elf ranger is suddenly realizing that she cannot
wear/make one bit of the new tradeskill made ranger gear.  They are gonna
nail me for my race, or my god, one way or the other!
