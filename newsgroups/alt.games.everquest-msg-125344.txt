I am sure this is probly a stupid question but....

I am new to everquest, been playing about a week now.  In this past
week there have been time of my certain death, when some person would
come and save me.  I have always said thank you and offered them
something of there choice that I had, or would let them loot corpses
that I would kill.

Most of the time they would just say "you're welcome" and sometime
they heal me and then just go off into the wilderness.  Is it not
common to pay (or somehow return a favor) for someone saving your
life?

Just don't want to be hated because of ignorance.
