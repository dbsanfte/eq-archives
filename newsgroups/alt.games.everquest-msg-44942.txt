 Easier way is to get levitate. Run a little north from the Skyfire zone
(loc 100 comes to mind) then head east. You should end up at the canyon
ledge right above the temple. I've only died once trying to get to HS
and that was the first time when I didn't know the scorpion things Harm
Touched so didn't bother with invis. You can wait outside the orb, even
uninvis if you're in the right spot. When you get to the orb room take a
left and that wall is safe. They are slow to aggro so you can even run
to the orb from there and click on it and probably not get HTd.
