I have played just about every class in the game, and if there is one class
that has gotten screwed time and time again, it's the WARRIOR. No bind, no
gate, no heal, no sow, no pet. Luclin comes out and everyone gets new
spells...what does the warrior get? Nothing! So those of you-mostly druids-that
complain about-oh, I can't port to Luclin, oh, my new spell isnt that
good,...boo friggin whoo. 
VERANT do something, give us warriors a bind ring, or something for God's sake.
I always wondered why high lvls warriors were hard to find, now I know. People
get tired of relying on others to heal them, and if they travel from their bind
points, they are screwed-once again-if they die and have to run to their
corpse. A caster can sit doen and load his spells to fight along the way-a
warrior is naked and unarmed. 
Oh, that seems fair--ppththttththththththththththththth
