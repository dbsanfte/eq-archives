Hi

Need to go there and pick up a piece of a wizard rod for 
the staff of the wheel quest, where down there with my
rogue so i could find the way easier, thing was the hand
scowled at med even when usinng hide sneak, would a normal
invis/invis to undead work on that thing? and is the area below the
water safe? i mean where can i stand when casting gate / or invis of
any sort drops?

Also if the hand is killed what is the respawn time?

Died twice trying to get there so far :(
