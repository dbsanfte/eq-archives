Ok.. this has always bothered me!
Be it a open raid or a closed invitation only raid.
Most arguements I have seen in NG and website, is usually in favor or
the point system (DK... think I got that right), which is actually a
reward to those that are ALWAYS there to go on raids and help out.

Well, that is all fine and dandy, but my arguement is the reverse.
I would LOVE to go on raids all the time and help out as much as I
can.
BUT.... unlike some it seems I have responsibilities in RL as well as
in  game. I do play a LOT, but seems my schedule only seems to allow
me time to play when there are NO scheduled raids.

Its a hard question to answer I think...  I think those that do go on
raids all the time should be rewarded, but what about the those like
myself that really want to go on raids as much as possible but can't
always do so? We should be able to get a SHOT at some ot the loot
SOMETIMES.

Don't get me wrong here.. not whining, hehe.. no matter how it looks.
I understand that sometimes your just NOT gonna get loot on a raid and
not EVERYONE can get loot from a raid.

I just think its a little unfair that some characters have.. friends
and family that PLAY their characters while they aren't there, so that
character can be played just about 24/7
Its just me here, I am the only one that plays my character ;-(
There are many others like me in the same boat.

Thats why IMHO raid loot should be full random with NBG of course.
Any item that drops, only those classes that can immediately equip it
and if its a 'upgrade' to thier current equipment can roll for it.
After all the above get that drop.. then it goes full random for when
it drops again.

Not really sure how to handle a really nice item, like say the
Burrower hide tunic...
Most guilds/raid groups will only allow cleric, shaman or druid roll
for that, even tho its equipable by other classes as well... like for
example my beastlord ;-).... 
I would feel extremely cheated if my beastlord was in group when that
dropped and was not allowed to roll for it.
Yeah I understand that clerics bring a LOT to a raid group and will
save its ass with rezzes when it gets wiped and should be aptly
rewarded.. but geez, with that I will prolly NEVER be able to get that
tunic. hehe, cause mostly likely there will  ALWAYS be a cleric,
shaman or druid there that does have it yet. Ok.. that was WHINING!!
;-)

Ok.. what are others' oppinions on this??
Sorry for such and long post and don't be childish and flame for me
for my little bit of whining there ;-)
