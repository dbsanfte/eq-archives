I'd guess "when we were in a really tough fight" might imply to you
that it was afterwards, but it certainly doesn't to me.   I'd personally
use "it was after we were in a really tough fight" myself.  YMMV.

BTW, my wife has parked her pet several times during fights,
especially hard-pressed ones.   Root an add, root the mob
engaged, /pet back off, and /pet sit down is a good way for the
owner to get back mana while the pet regens.   Mage pet regen
is pretty quick and can make a difference.   The "secret" is to
get separation between the mobs, and use the "back off" command
several times until the pet actually manages to get away.

Oh, and before you ask "How does a mage root?" the answer is:
crystalline silk net.   Common drop in Crystal Caverns, a place
it's common to go to farm crystalline silks and velium for the
answer to "How does a mage port?"   The crystalline silk nets
don't stack, but carrying them can be a lifesaver.   Nothing quite
like "Yoner is going to die!!", root, reclaim energy, pull up pet,
repeat.  It actually allows a mage to solo yellows, at least, in the
40s....

At any rate, he's not the only one that thought you were allowing
the pet (and you) to regen during a fight.  The difference was that
I didn't find that unusual. ;)
