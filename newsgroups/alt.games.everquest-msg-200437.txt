Excuse me?  How are mobs that hit for 500+ and have 15k-20k hp easier
than mobs that hit for 160 or so and have 10k hp?  The former will eat
my 61 air pet in a short while unslowed, and chaining heals will not
keep it alive, even until I run OOM.  OTOH that same pet can trivially
tank the latter, needing a CH every minute or so. 

I've got a lot of respect for you, and most of what you have to say
makes sense, but that statement is just plain rediculous.

Like you, my RL buddy is a 65 ranger.  I don't know how his gear
compares - he runs about 1300hp fully buffed (we have a 65 cleric
that he bots in our groups).  He's just shy of 45 aa and AM3 atm.
He can trivially tank those pre-pop xp mobs, they pound themselves
on the DS on my pet while it does tremendous dps and he steps back
and destroys them with archery (+my nukes).

Our threesome, however, cannot handle anything more than tier 1
junk mobs without resorting to aggro-kiting, at least not without
serious downtime.

No, I don't think they will.  Folks like James and the others who've
racked up massive aa and gear have demonstrated the ability to find the
fastest way to rack up xp, then do it for prolonged periods to better
their characters.  These are the same folks who used to monopolize
whole patches of 'shrooms in FG with a soloing warrior/monk or what
have you.

You don't get to his level if you tire of this sort of thing.

The worst thing about this is that, if xp groups become less common
in tier 2 and up zones, getting my spectral drop spells just became
way harder.  Convincing a group to go take much harder mobs that require
a more traditional group just to get spectrals is going to be a hard
road.
