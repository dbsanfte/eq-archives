Ok, maybe I'm getting irritated for no reason, but I've been
plopped...unwillingly...int a ring war twice in the past three days.

Not really a big deal, had a group member get killed in both...but got him a
90% rez.  But was quite irritating to be engaged in a fight just to have all
three MObs *POOF* just before they were dead.

Question is...if you intend on waging a ring war, shouldn't you at least
have the common courtesy to announce it to people hunting in the zone
beforehand?  The first night, I had only been in the zone for a short amount
of time, so I may have missed the /shout.  Last night, we had been there for
four hours...no announcement.  I would have expected those types of manners
in LOIO (c;
