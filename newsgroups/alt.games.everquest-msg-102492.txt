Yano, I got this nagging suspicion that I *had* seen a troll somewhere
in your .sig after I posted that, but it was really too late to do
anything about it. Mega Chalupa or whatever they say in Rome.

Yeah, playing three pet classes would get a bit samey I guess. I'm
currently down to one, my gnomish necro on Lanys. And I don't play
him all that much either, these days... But I liked the backstory
on your beastlord, shame she had to be deleted...

And before Luclin, we didn't even have Beastlords. But it makes sense,
trolls *are* too stupid to be int casters, and too primitive to have
a really organized religion, so that leaves clerics out. As for druids?
A trollish druid? Heh.

My advice: Don't. My first serious character will *not* get deleted,
underequipped and low-level though he may be. I gave him the wrong
stats too, and a "bad" race for the class. (Gnomish rogue, bumped up
dex and agi)

Even though I'll probably never play Waspus again, he was my first
character to 20, and I learned the ropes playing him. Deleting him
would be too weird...

Yeah, it'd be cool and all, but when you think agile and dexterous, is
the first image to pop into your mind a troll? Likewise with my dream:
when you think stealthy assasin, is it a troll that pops into your
mind?

You can very well go it all the way to 60 outdoors, there never is a
need to go inside. But there are two attractions to outdoor zones:

1) Dungeon exp modifiers. Particularly with the new newbie dungeon
ZEM bonuses, you can get a lot more exp in dungeons than you'd get
outside.

2) Phat lewts. You *will* find the good loot in indoor zones, and
of course, to get your epic (if you want to get it) you have to
venture into dungeons.

All that said, playing exclusively in outdoor zones is just as valid
as going dungeon crawling, and if your play style doesn't fit the
dungeons, you're allowed to not go there.

Well, what you could do, see, is find a wealthy senior citizen, and
one of you could seduce him/her, depending on gender and sexual
preference. Then, when the vict^W^W^W^W poor thing dies, you'd
inherit their wealth, and the pair of you could retire early, playing
EQ all the time! I'm a real problemsolver, me! This might work better
in Beverly Hills than in SD, though... And possibly it only works in
movies and books, too...
