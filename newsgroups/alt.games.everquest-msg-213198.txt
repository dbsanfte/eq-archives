I am curious.  You and the other poster are saying that tens of
millions of people should each individually pay thousands of
dollars extra for every vehicle they buy so that a handful of
otherwise preventable deaths might be prevented?  Do you have
the vaguest sense of proportion?  Has it occurred to you, for
example, that pricing newer (often safer) vehicles out of the
reach of so many more people could easily contribute to many
more deaths than you are seeking to prevent?
