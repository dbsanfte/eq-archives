Well, I think it's only a minor exageration.  But even if I'm wrong
(gasp! inconceivable!), it's not like hyperbole is a rarity around here.

There're a lot of camps/mobs besides the most popular higher level
solo spots that more or less fit my generalization.  What set me off
(today) was that I was just barely able to solo a minor loot mob in
LowerGuk (Ghoul Sentinel), and that only because I had KEI at the
time (an add would've been lethal and so I drained my mana bar nuking
the damned thing).  Now this mob is pretty much cut out of VI's
generic pattern for minor "named" mobs:  boost the AC, HP, ATK, & DMG
all substantially over "normal" for the level of the mob, and maybe
make the resists a little better.  This makes it very lethal to melees
and easy pickings for any caster that can root and dot.  A naked L50
Druid (or a 45 Necro with a bonechip) wouldn't have broken a sweat over
this mob, yet it was a tough fight for a L53 Paladin in decent gear
with a buff (KEI) that allowed me quite a few extra nukes (remember
this is an undead mob, against which I have substantial advantages).
So, while I enjoyed the battle, it still reminded me that I hadn't ever
vented this particular bitch in the newsgroup.  :-p

I've got a Druid on FV.  But I bore easily.  (Not a slam on Druids,
most folks who play casters seem to think melees are boring, I find
the reverse true).
