I guess it all depends on how much time you can spend in the bazaar selling.
If you have a second computer and account you can keep going all the time
it's probably worth it to price things a little higher and wait for them to
sell.  I always price things low so they will move quickly so I can get on
with playing the game since I don't have a second computer to run my bazaar
mule on.
