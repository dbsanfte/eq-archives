There's a huge gaping difference between not saying anything, and being 
outright heartless.  There's been quite enough maudlin sentimentality 
smeared across TV.  Let's not start screaming at EVERY person who 
doesn't shout out how saaaaad and horrrrrrified they still are after a 
year, okay?  Personally, I'd rather they just gave a little thought to 
the victims in their heads without standing on top of a mountain and 
screaming out to everybody that they're Sad.  In fact, that annoys *me*, 
but otoh, had they done so, I wouldn't have scrambled on over to AGE to 
let everybody know in the most foulmouthed way possible how upset I was 
over it.
