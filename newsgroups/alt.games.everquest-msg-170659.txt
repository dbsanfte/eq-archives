Back when CT was a low level zone, I was getting some xp on 4c..

We'd pull the half the pyramid at a time, backstab, ho!
Amazing how little damage you take constantly chain AE stunning.

Pallys on healing/tanking. They all had some slow right click heal item,
Pally 1 gets 50 percent, calls taunt 2, pally 2 starts taunting, pally 1
stops, etc. They'd heal up between fights while I was out pulling another
bunch of undead. Was a blast. I also got to keep charmies up almost all
night (I was the enchanter, of course)

My AE group...

There was a SK that was not in the group that would pull off anything that
just would not stay stunned.
Most AE groups I get invited to want two enchanters, for safety. Pttthh AE
is about insane kill rates, not safety.

My last group in UP (not AE unfortunately)
Enchanter, with animation (me)

root/rot like crazy, or for summoners, pull, slow, let my pet get on it,
they keep pet alive and dot. Though really I was not contributing all that
much.

Mage (w/epic)

I pulled, charmed liberally. 6 pets+epic max hasted BL+snare+fear+dots+mana
taps+life taps+DD+muzzle+dual wielding summoned weaps+clarity+SR=very
quickly dead mobs. The mage kept complaining about me taking damage from
charm breaks but I think he was just jealous of my pet (that I was getting
being level 53) outdamaging his (he was 58)
