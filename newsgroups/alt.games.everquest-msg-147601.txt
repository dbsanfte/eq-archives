I've seen enchanters use them effectively in rather difficult battles 
but I'm pretty sure they were using an overhead view for targeting.  I 
can't imagine being able to do it any other way as the horse  is a 
challenge for click targeting even more so than the Ogres and Trolls you 
are used to heh.  On mez breaks you have the advantage of not sitting so 
faster to cast and less damage if they get to you faster than you can 
stop them, but increased chance of interrupt if they move you because on 
a horse you are more easily moved than if standing on your feet.

I'll leave any further commentary from real enchanters with ponies as my 
40s enchanter is mostly soloed and has no  horse <g>.
