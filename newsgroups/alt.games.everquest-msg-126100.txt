lol, MMORPG companies look for feedback when designing their future product.
I venture much of the feedback from Ex EQ'ers was the complaint about
quests.  Sitting in one spot for weeks at a time killing the same thing over
and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and
over and over and over and over just to kill that rare green mob to grab
that coveted quest item.  Then you go do the samething in another zone.  Is
that EPIC in nature?  LOL< you think the designers needed some Yale degree
to think up quests like that?  it's not EPIC whatsoever in nature.. lol,  I
wager due to complaints the DAOC boys toned the camping down a bit in terms
of quests...to tone down the Epicness of it.. ROFL
