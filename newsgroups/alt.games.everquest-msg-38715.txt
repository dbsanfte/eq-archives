You can't get faction to deal with them, ever.
They don't offer quests because you have bad faction to start and
there are no kills which raise their faction = SOL.

My dark elf cleric of inny is glower dubious and has same problem. My
31 troll sk of cazic is scowl to them so she said "well screw you
too!" and started killing allt he blue kejekens who run around to the
south east of the zone by a rock wall where there is a constant parade
of them and granitebacks and such. Really a great place for a 31 sk to
solo on blues.
