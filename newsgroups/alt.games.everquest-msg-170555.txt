Hi all,

I am having a bit of a problem when I go raiding. I try to turn off all
spell effects so I don't experience lag (or as much lag) but no matter what
I do I still see the effects. This is a huge problem because when I try to
heal and my mouse can't make it to my spell icon fast enough because of the
lag.

What I normally do to turn off spell effects is I got to Options -> Filters
Tab -> Turn NPC Spells off, Turn PC, Bard Songs, Critical Spells and
Critical Meelee off. Another thing I do is type "/shows off"

One time when I logged on and couldn't see any spell effects. But next time
all effects were back. Does anyone know if there is a bug for this? Am I
doing anything wrong? Suggestions?

Thanks all!
