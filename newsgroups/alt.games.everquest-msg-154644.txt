Handing in sarnak braids to captain rotgrim inside the outpost. Youll need
to get some sort of illusion to do this. Maybe boon, or one of the illusions
masks (not sure if theres an all/all one). Posibly enchanters will be able
to cast illusion on someone else soon, so that would make things easy for
you.

Geting back is easy. Swim the the sw corner of TD and activate the cabilis
firepot.
