This is true of all invis spells, except for the bard version and "improved"
invis lines.  The former almost never wears off prior to its listed
duration... 18 seconds unless you stay in range on the pulses.  The latter
last 10 minutes and never break early... but are self only.

At least with the group versions, you only have to cast once to reinvis
someone.  With single target, you break your own invis while casting on the
target, so now you have to cast AGAIN to get yourself.  On the other hand, I
tend to do this anyway, as I'd rather have the "no break" version on myself.
If you die, well, I'll drag you to a safe spot and rez you there.
