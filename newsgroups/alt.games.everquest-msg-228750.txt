Ah, but there is - they're boosting the mana regen of
TPP and XPG by 2 per tick to 6 and 8 respectively.  Of course,
if you have BoT9 on that doesn't change your actual regen.

In fact Rytan mentioned that the thing keeping pet HP down
was pet-canni.  Acknowledging that we were balanced around
this.  He said it in regards to future expansions though, so
I think we might see mages rebalanced with Gates of Discord,
the same way were were with PoP.
