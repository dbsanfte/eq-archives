The sound is not normal, particularly if it gets louder after the system has
been running a while.

Is the sound coming from the speakers or the computer? If you mute the
soundcard volume, do you still hear the sound? If you reboot, does it go
away?  There are several possible causes. Try moving the speakers to a
different position. Make certain the speaker wires are not running near any
electrical cords. The source could be electrical interference. Are there
fluorescent lighting fixtures plugged into the same electrical line? Try
plugging the computer into a different outlet, or temporarily unplugging or
turning off appliances.

Gives these things a try and let me know if they help.
