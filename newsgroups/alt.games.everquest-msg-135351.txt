Your not as Furar'ed as you thought you where ...

while that was rather unlucky you are rather fortunatly below the lvl cap on
lesser summon corpse !!

This means any SK over 25 or a necro of 12 (or was it 16) or higher can
summon it with a very cheap coffin (about 1pp)

I'm sorry to say my SK is on Karana so I cant help much, But with the choice
of either a SK (go for one over 30 so he has invis) or Necro your bound to
find a helper, but you may have to offer to buy the spell for them (its
about 21pp)

I Wish you luck recovering your body
