From the shadows, the mysterious "Charles Whitney"

You're getting some weird vibes I certainly never noticed. He gave
kudos to Allen for daring to break out of the EQ-clonefest the market
has turned into, but other than that wasn't particularly interested in
Horizons as evidence of anything.

Like Wolfpack, he did not have much in the way of skill or a capable
team. However that doesn't invalidate his *ideas*. Wouldn't you rather
see something off the beaten path? Mmorpgs are becoming as stale as
rtss.

The thread about Sigil that was posted yesterday is rather recent
proof that the "new ideas" is still quite feasible, if you have the
people to bring it off. Sigil probably does; AE obviously didn't.

Again, you are drawing way too much out of Horizons. Very little of
the article was about Horizons so its hard to agree with your
assessment of the author. All he banged on was Horizons changing its
original ideals to something closer to the EQ-clone ideal of level
grind on rats so you can get closer to the elusive endgame.

I think he's being misread by those who seem to be latching onto small
parts, like you and Horizons and the others in this thread and PvP.

Depends on how you mean. EQ's numbers support the idea that there are
lots who like the level grind etc; but no other game's numbers have
come close, indicating that those who do like that will tend to stick
with EQ (barring regional differences like FFXI) or find it boring
elsewhere. It's also not evidence that people *won't* play something
different, nor is it evidence that a game doing something different
can't do better. The playerbase isnt tapped out; it's barely been
touched.

However the numbers (those being those who tried Shadowbane and early
DAoC, along with the private UO shards) indicate there *is* a market
for a more world-oriented rather than game-oriented system, except no
one has actually made one that works yet.

Some argue that it can never be made to work; I don't agree but under
the current atmosphere we may never get a chance to find out; like
what happened with Horizons, no one is willing to take a risk anymore
when they can just shovel out a EQ-clone and play it safe.
