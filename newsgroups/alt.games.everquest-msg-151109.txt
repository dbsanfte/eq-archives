    Guilds across all servers just got better at healing without doing a
thing. Their lag profile hasn't changed, nobody has been forced to play a
class they don't want, they don't have fewer of any class so their ability
to do other things hasn't changed, and they still got better at healing. And
as a cleric, I take the view that healing wins encounters second only to
aggro control.

    Of course I didn't plan on Verant to mess up the aggro on a ton of mobs
when I wrote that. Perhaps that was their control mechanism. But hearing
about Arch Lich going berserk and killing a mage who had only done one
thing - cast a damage shield on someone not yet in combat - rather than
attack the melees whacking him makes me wonder what monkey did the coding
this week.

    Sometimes. Sometimes it gets made easier - think back to the original
Cursed, or crazy broken Shei. The thing you folks should complain about is
always, ALWAYS any "good and easy" loot is removed from the mob but not from
the people that already snagged it. I still think that's unfair - if you're
going to retro-enhance when you enhance items, retro-nerf as well. Be
consistant.

    Compare the current Thall mobs in VT, which AoE 250 DD and stun 3
seconds, for the old Thall mobs which did AoE 250 DD, knockback and blind
where the last two parts could not be resisted. Which do you think is the
harder effect to fight? Not all encounters get made harder.
