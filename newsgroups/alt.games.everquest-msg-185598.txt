Hm.  How about this one?  I logged on an unguilded ranger once and was 
yakking away in a few channels including some guild channels when I 
suddenly got a tell saying "what are you doing in such and such a 
guild?"  I did a /who on me and I was indeed in a certain guild that I'd 
never even heard of.  Switching to third person view showed no guild tag 
above my head.  Doing a /who all guild brought up "you are not in a 
guild etc".  We fiddled that way for a bit then I zoned and it 
disappeared.  Very weird.
