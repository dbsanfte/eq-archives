Well that's a pretty silly statement, frankly. Teamwork is not just alive in
EQ, it has become more and more important in the game during the past year
or so. This has clearly been the developers' intent: they significantly
tilted the scales away from solo exp towards group exp, and they implemented
LDoN adventuring which is by definition entirely about teamwork. And it's
worked, at least on regular servers: there is far more grouping and far less
soloing now as a fraction of all player time than was true a year ago. (May
not be true on PvP servers, I wouldn't know).

This "Leadership Experience" concept will just encourage the trend.
Competent group leadership is a particular skillset, one which is most
painfully obvious when it's absent. (How many winnable LDoN adventures have
you lost simply because nobody took charge and made some tactical decisions,
or was able to convince an erratic player to settle down and be smarter, or
whatever?). This particular skillset is entirely about teamwork, obviously.
Now it sounds like players who do a good job in that capacity can earn some
extra rewards. This will encourage players who could do it well but
currently don't feel like taking on the extra trouble in what is after all
recreation, to step up to the plate.

And since joining and staying in an EQ group is entirely voluntary, the
most-rewarded groupleaders will not be those who behave as "hitlers." It
will be those who are able show other players that they can make grouping
with them both successful _and_ pleasant. In other words: good leadership.

The more good groupleaders are active in EQ, the more good teamwork there
will be in EQ. Works for me.
