Use them against single targets.  Lower aggro than a full nuke, higher
damage if they all stick for less mana.

The biggest risk with rain spells is catching adds in them.  Single mob,
clear, engaged, you cast your rain.  Another mob rushes in from some
previously unseen location, and walks into the second wave - you're the
only person who's done any damage to it - usually ugly.

Rain spells were the mainstay of my wizard during the 46-56 levels in tier
one planes.
