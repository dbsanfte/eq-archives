You could go via the OT, but I suspect the boat to OT might come in too far
to shore before you "zone". You could catch the shuttles in oasis to TD,
then swim to the elven outpost to board the maidens voyage. Sow and levi
would make it pleasant. If it were me, id goto DL via nexus, bega sow and
run through DL. It isnt much of an issue with sow and invis up, even at your
level. Another option would be to port to EJ, and run to loio (various
routes).
