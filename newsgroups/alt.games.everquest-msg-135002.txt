I would, but, well, Tony Blair will probably come over and fuck me up :P

That's a remarkably naive view of the whole thing, but whatever. I'm
sure the mighty USA government tells you everything. Of course, the UK
press is world famous for being gutsy, unafraid and socially conscious
 - no doubt the New York Times is equally discerning :P .

Sure you will.

Erm, yeah, but if you had read (and understood) my post you would have 
realised that I was commenting on your rather bizarre definition
of what oppression actually is. A lot of what you call oppression I call
social responsibility.

The idiocy of this is phenomenal. The black voters I refer to are the
ones who were not even allowed to vote. I had forgotten about the ballot
paper farago.

'a black'. Nice.

OK, That's your viewpoint, fine. But considering how you've been
lecturing me about official secrets I would have expected you to put two
and two together here.

The American Viewpoint: Not from America (hell, not white) == evil
facists who want to take our guns away, along with the ability to fuck
our 14 yr old cousins. Have you ever been here, whatsyername? I think
you'll be pleasantly surprised when you aren't tortured in the
immigration lounge (well, so long as you don't speak...).
