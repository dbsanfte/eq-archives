I've been hunting in Everfrost much lately, and trying to raise my faction
with merchants there by doing the polar bear skin quest, the spider fungus
quest, and ice goblin necklace quest.  I've got many quality skins (bear,
wolf, cat) in my bank just taking up space.  I'll eventually go back to EC
to auction them (the E-Bay of EQ).  I've also got MANY bone chips.  Should I
try to sell pelts and silk separately or should I make silk into thread or
cord, or use both for padded armor.  I want the most profit available here.
Also are bandit sashes any good?  Any other quests that quickly raise
faction with merchants of Halas?

And for a Barbarian Warrior, what would be a safe level to try to solo
mammoths (one at a time)?  I've seen that they're LV22-26.
