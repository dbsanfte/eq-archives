Don't train the safe spot. If you get aggro while running to the safe
spot, you _may_ want to train it west along the wall (ask raid
leader), so it's easier to get your corpse. Also, don't train the safe
spot.

When you get to fighting the terror guys (dispel), don't bother
re-buffing people until they're all dead.

The hardest part is breaking in. If people don't train the safe spot,
your chances of success raise dramatically.
