I'd guess it's to discourage the type of camp management like the
SRo theory where you kill the undead spawn in the tower at 7am to
spawn the AC.  IIRC, Grimrot in SK also has the same type of camp
theory.

Luclin obviously has some type of clock management (as you pointed
out, Norrath rises and sets) but it doesn't appear the players have
access to that information.  That's going to make that type of camp
a lot more random, as I'd guess it was intended to be by the content
designers, to the *casual* player.

The obvious flaw would be making events on Luclin happen along with
the game time on Norrath, essentially giving guild members the same
information.   There's certainly no reason to do that, though, even if
you keep the player in sync with Norrath by time.   A Norrathian day
is 72 minutes, IIRC.   If a player ports to the Nexus, waits 72 minutes
and ports back down, he -- most likely -- will find the time to be the
same as when he left, plus one day.   Luclin's day-cycle, though, could
be set on a different real-world time schedule.  One would have to
get the game time Norrath rises each day in a set position to be sure.

Like I said, though, that makes camps like that a lot more random to
the casual player.   Players with real-world timers in front of them
aren't going to be affected and neither will guilded (or multi-account)
players who can get the time on Norrath easily if the time on both
is actually in sync.   It shouldn't take long, though, before someone
publishes Luclin's cycle, if it hasn't been done already.   It's not that
difficult to determine.
