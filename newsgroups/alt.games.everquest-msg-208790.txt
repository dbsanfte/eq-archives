You can get lightstones from mobs other than willowisps. In Innothule
Swamp, around the newbie area, a number of snakes and zombies carry
lightstones. If it's night, you can tell which ones are packing because
they glow. You don't need magic weapons to kill them either.

You can buy lightstones from merchants who live near areas where they drop.
Not quite as satisfying, but it likely won't set you back as much as a
magic weapon would.

You can group with someone near your level to take on a willowisp. There
are probably a few level 10ish wizards around who could take out a wisp
if only they could survive long enough to get some spells off. You've got
your kick, snare, healing, and flame lick to distract the wisp while some
more fragile caster dishes out the damage.

A mage could summon you a magic weapon. It'll be NO RENT, though. Still,
it will allow you to possibly solo a wisp. And it's (typically) free.

You could head up to bazaar with 5pp in hand and see what you can find
that's magic.

There aren't many mobs you can kill at level 10 that will drop a magic
weapon, but there might be a few quests you can do at level 10 that will
get you one. And although they tend to be really sucky magic weapons, they
will still be better than punching. Allakhazam is your friend for this
type of thing.
