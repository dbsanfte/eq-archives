I would suggest trying to buy an item with serpent sight on it, my low level
human druid and erudite wizard both use a Glowing Stine Band. They are a bit
expensive for a low level, sell for about 120pp and higher but work well for
the night blind races and make a nice tempory solution for casters untill
they get the spells that do the same.

Glowing Stone Band
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM
Slot: FINGER
AC: 2
Effect: Serpent Sight
WT: 0.1  Size: ?
Class: ALL
Race: ALL
