The problem is that 54+ is where the XP curve gets a bit stiffer.  so
the example isn't quite accurate.  If you can find a place where you
can handle the pulls, and manage quick killing(a 50 or 55 DH instance)
you might find that the xp will curve in your favor.

The way xp actually works is base on Current xp
Lv 50 Mob is worth 1M xp
Group Bonus of 2x=2M
Level 56 with 235M xp  35%  700Kxp
Level 55 with 167M xp  25%  500kxp
level 54 with 125M XP  18  % 360kxp
Level 51 with 58M XP   9  %  180kxp
Level 48 with 47M XP   7 %  140kxp
Level 47 with 40M XP  6 %   120kxp

Once all characters get past lvl 50, you'll be able to take advantage
of the HCB or High Con Bonus for killing stuff >5 levels higher than
you.
