No, no, you misunderstand.  I'm quite certain that I play suboptimally
by most any definition of "optimal" other than "sounds like fun to me".
That doesn't stop me from having a low opinion of single spawn campers.

I do not have an opinion on how frequently you should die.  I do think
that it's lame to gain experience at a substantial rate with no real
risk of PC deaths.

Depends on a lot more factors than that.  And I'm thinking more of
higher risk zones (dungeons) where the xp now slides from incredible
to merely pretty good as the challenge slides from tough to trivial.

Well, that's my opinion.  But, as one example, I've seen a lo- to
mid-40's group camping the "church" in Kaesora for xp on Stromm,
and their /ooc's about HS key parts rotting suggest just how long
they've been doing it (over multiple play sessions I have no doubt).
Previously, groups like that left for greener pastures, nowadays
they are the equivalent of the dr00ds who used to camp the Paladin
quest mobs in BBM.  All I'm saying is that one of the unintended
side-effects of the big group bonus is 6-packs of lamers backhanding
easy mobs for good xp with zero risk.
