That's generally not necessary.  It's usually enough to boot to safe
mode, change the card's entry in device manager to Standard VGA, shut
down, switch cards, boot back into safe mode, and install the nVidia
Detonator Drivers (grab the reference ones from the web site).  The only
exception is if you're going from newer nVidia drivers to older ones,
since they don't uninstall cleanly and can cause conflicts.

Enjoy the card...I run a GF3 Ti200 (somewhat overclocked) and it's been
very good to me.  Wish I'd bought it a month later to take advantage of
the price drop, though!
