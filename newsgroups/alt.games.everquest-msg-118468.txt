I've run other less-intensive games using shared dial-up years ago before I
made the leap to broadband, and most games ran crappy then.  I seriously
doubt you would find EQ enjoyable with this kind of setup.  Basically, you
can only pour so much water into a funnel.  I think EQ would seriously bog
down considerably.
Either get another dial-up line or go broadband.  I don't know what costs
for an extra dial-up line would be in your area, but a friend of mine
specified to our local phone company that his new phone connection was to be
internet-only.  It turns out they offered an internet-only connection for a
little more than half what they charge for an extra line.  I have no idea
why it would be cheaper, and I've never heard of anyone else getting this
deal, but when I teased my friend about being a bull-shitter over this
matter he later showed me his bill and it was legit.  So if you must get an
extra dialup, you might want to give that a shot.
Other than that, I really don't recommend running 2 accounts through a
single 56k.

Best of luck,
SEAN...
