Greetings...

I'm a new poster here, so please forgive any repeat questions i might ask, but
i'm having a little problem...I'm playing as a warrior, based in Qeynos, and
have been undergoing the Class-based armor quest for the Steel Warriors...

I've assembled all but one piece of the armor in the space of a very dedicated
week...
Now, i'm stuck on crafting the greaves for the set...they require 4 Bricks of
Crude iron(luckily found on just about every gnoll in the Qeynos hills), a lion
tail, a young plain cats scalp, and a giant fire beetle brain....

As the title of this post indicates, i'm having trouble with the brains...today
alone, i patiently stalked and killed 20 Giant Fire Beetles from Toxxulia
Forest to the Western Karanas...in a moment of insane desperation, i even went
after Queen Klicnik...(was very dissappointed by her empty corpse, not worth
the effort of the kill)

Has anyone here completed this quest already? And if so, where did you find the
brains? Are they just an extremely rare 'no drop' like i'm thinking, or am i
killing the wrong kind of Giant Beetle?

Thanks in advance for any help or advice.

*I've seen several warriors running around Qeynos in the full set, so i know it
can be done...and Ebon Strongbear claims the pieces can all be found or bought
in the immediate region...*
