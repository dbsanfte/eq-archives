Monks used to mitigate and avoid.
SK's used to mitigate

Monks now just avoid
Sk's still mitigate

Swings and roundabouts..

Why would he?  Imo he's taking more damage, just has a bigger HP pool to
absorb that damage..

Thats complete bull.  I have the mob malod+slowed within 5% of his HP
dropping (which is the exact same time if its a warrior with duel EB as
tank)..  should I also have unloaded 5k in dots on the mob by that point?

I don't use any special weapons for taunt, but if it's imperitive that I
keep agro, I equip Tunare sap.  14/19 isn't a horrid ratio, the ensnare
effect procs frequently, and the agro generated is pretty uber

See now you're talking total HP and cheals.. thats generally about one
thing - size of the hp pool (hmm that doesn't seem to make sense in the same
way you talk about a mana pool...)

What HP does you're SK tank in BoT have, 7k?   Find a monk with 7k HP, and
see how well he fairs with cheals cast at the same frequency.  I won't
disagree with the agro and hate SK's generate...  thats their number 1
purpose

I don't exp in BoT but my guildies do, and my guildie monks tank for their
groups often.

> Sorry, but higherlevel a Monk isn't a good Tank.

For mobs where /disc evasive or /disc evensive is required, or where agro
control is 100% critical, I totally agree with you.

I don't think the stuff were talking about fits into any of the above tho
