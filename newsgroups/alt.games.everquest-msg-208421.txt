wtf kind of pathetic excuse are those dumbasses gonna offer up
for this one?  first they manage somehow to fu the accounts of
most everybody foolish enough to pre-order LDoN.  now the login
server has been inaccessable for at least the last half-hour.
we've endured a lot of learning experiences with these rubes,
i've even defended them from time to time, but isn't it about
time they actually learned a thing or two?  i was really
looking forward to LDoN, but right now i'm ready to tell those
ignorant baboons just where they can shove the gdpos, and i
sure as hell am not in any mood to buy it.
