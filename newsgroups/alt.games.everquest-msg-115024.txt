Snip

You said bard, I can see that. My vote goes to Shadowknight.

 Shadowknights kind of end up being the happiest go lucky classes
in the game, which seems a bit ironic since they are suppoosed to be
evil. They actually seem HAPPY to lend a hand because they are asked
so very rarely. Many people forget all about them in the "find my
corpse" market. I play my level 36 SK as a break from my 39 cleric and
56 druid. It is never anon and never gets asked for a thing. If I ever
see anyone asking for a corpse locate spell in /ooc when I'm in a
zone, I do because it just happens so very rarely.

Another thng that puts SKS in a good mood in the high level game is
that their loot is freaking plentiful. It drops like candy in fear and
plane of growth. There are many sk only items like the moss which get
freaking amazingly cheap on servers. Its one of the easiest and
cheapiest characters to outfit well.

Sk also comes with all the tools it needs to solo well in semi direct
melee damage fighting, though it might be fearing/snaring the critter.
This lets it solo well and fairly quickly all the way up to 60.

Ogres and trolls are especially joyful/goofy sks who never seem to
complain at all.
