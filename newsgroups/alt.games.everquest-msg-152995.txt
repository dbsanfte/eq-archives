A lot of studies have been done about this, and there is even a medical
term, coprophagia.  There are some risks if you live in an area tat isn't
big on vaccinating your dogs or has a large stray population, but for the
most part, it's harmless.  While distasteful to humans, there really isn't a
reason for it not to be consumed.  Typically there are several nutrients in
it that have been undigested.  It might also have to do with some dogs being
quite fastideous, and if they are kept in a cage their whole life (it
happens more often than you think) they will develop a habit of eating their
waste.

Easiest way to cure it is to pick it up as soon as it hits the lawn.  People
say add cayene to their diet, and there are other gimicks out there, but
come on, you have to pick it up anyway, so why not just right away.

Now cat poop is something else entirely.  It's like Godiva.  It makes for
keeping a litter box clean easier, but no one really likes dog kisses with
an eau de toilette de chat.  Again, you can do things to change the feces,
but it really doesn't solve the problem, just keep everything neat and
clean.

There is an actual reason for this.  Dogs are scavengers and sometime
hunters.  Unfortunately for them, they either smell like dogs, or like the
shampoo that they may be frequently bathed in.  This usually warns their
prey that they are near and they lose out on a tasty snack.  Rolling in
feces tends to hide their aroma.  Again, distasteful to us, but hey, they
are probably wondering why our soldiers put paint all over their faces.

Hug your puppy, she sounds like she has being a dog down perfectly.
