In your eqclient.ini file there is a section that looks like:-

[TextColors]
User_1_Red=0
User_1_Green=0
User_1_Blue=0

These are what you set the changes in. Each colour is set using variables of
red/green/blue from 0 to 255.
For definition of what user (colour)_1 is check your eq supplement file, all
numbers are defined there.

Guild chat i believe is user_4.

If any body has a set of colour values that show up well i'd be most interested
to here them as i'm thinking of changing some of the colours myself.
