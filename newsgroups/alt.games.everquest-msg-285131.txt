Any particular reason warders were left out of this?? I run a 57 Beastlord 
and as soon as I hit 58 I'll have a 56 Warder that easily handles many of 
the mobs I go against... and if I apply the right spells, can out gun me in 
many cases.  My favorite tactic is to engage the mob with my warder while I 
pound away from the backside. This works very well in most cases, and if I 
end up pulling aggro, the warder is quite capable of doing damage since it 
is now behind the mob.

Just my 2 cents worth...
