I am sure you're correct - but I don't often fear-kite either.  I did in my
early 30's with the mob's outside Splitpaw (moment of silence...)  but since
then, I let my pet tank - hold aggro completely - while my DOT's and Taps do
their work.

I do, occasionally run in and take aggro if my pet starts losing HP quickly.

I think part of the reason I don't kite much is I have the world's laziest,
slowest drog...  BUT, I just got JBoots last night, so maybe I'll give
aggro-kiting a try.
