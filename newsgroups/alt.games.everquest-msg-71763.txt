At level 32, I got half a yellow bubble of exp for the Armor
of Ro quest turn-ins (and this was even back when Paladins had
the 40% exp penalty).  I'm talking about the stage where you
turn in the requested item(s) for the Ro armor molds in
Rathe Mountains.

And you don't have to be a Paladin to do them.
