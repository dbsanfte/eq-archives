So, trying this out, I got lazy and went with the tutorial this time. 
Why?  Well, if I do go Necro, I doubt I'm going to bother doing newbie 
armor quests.  Frankly, they aren't all that good for anyone, and as a 
class that doesn't rely on dishing out damage toe to toe with the mobs, 
I don't think they'll be worth the bother.  What I'll want to do is

A) Level up
B) Make cash to keep up with spells
C) Research to make the spells that can't be bought
D) Get focus gear
E) Look for HP gear
F) Look for regen gear
and to a lesser extent
G) Gear pet

I don't think there's much point to D, E, and F till I'm at least over 
10, G isn't that big a deal, C can't be done till... 16?  20?

So that leaves A and B to play with.  I'm pretty sure I can handle that.

So I'm looking more at learning to play the class again, rather than 
worrying about where to play it.  This, to me, meant that the tutorial, 
with its easy access to mobs, and its plentiful exp, was the way to go; 
I figure I'll leave and explore once I hit 10 or so.  After doing 10 
levels out in the "real world" as a paladin, this was really a relaxing 
approach, and I'm going to miss it on the Combine (or Sleeper if we go 
that way)

Thus far I'm 8 levels in, which is to say on my third pet, and about 
halfway to being a "real" necro; I still have to tank for the pet during 
difficult fights, my dark pact is tiny, I have no leech DOT/HOT, and so 
forth.  But I can at least drop a couple DOTs on the target, sic pet, 
sit and med if the target isn't too mean, and I do have a snare and a 
fear, although I haven't fear kited in the tight quarters of Gloomingdeep.

Much of what I learned before about necros is coming back to me, I'm 
sure I can get the hang of it if this is the way I decide to go.  One 
interesting note, now that you can bind wounds while sitting, Dark Pact 
is suddenly a lot more efficient... and I need to invest in a source of 
bandages.  Maybe gnome tinker is the way to go!

I haven't experimented much with the DE angle yet, at this point I could 
be pretty much any Necro race, although Hide has come in handy a few 
times; perhaps giving me partial FD benefits until I get higher level.
