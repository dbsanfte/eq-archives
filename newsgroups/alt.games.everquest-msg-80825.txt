:> Anyone know the price on a full set of Fine Plate.

: have to pay more)

Feel free to pay 10 pp per ac for bracers and neck piece, but a blacksmith
who makes all pieces of FP for 10 pp per ac, simply hasn't gotten orders 
for any harder pieces yet and doesn't know what he's doing. That comes from
a 243 skill blacksmith.

When I see another, clueless, blacksmith advertising at 10 pp/ac, I ask them
to make me a shipment of 10 FP cloaks for 100 pp a piece. 71+ pp + padding 
for each attempt, add 5% guaranteed failures from brick->sheet conversion
and 242 trivial skill.. well, smarter ones usually get the hint before 3rd
cloak or so, dumber ones just run out of money.

Anyway, the correct price for FP is 70-75 pp per *sheet*.. meaning 70-225
pp per item. Any less and one shouldn't be bothered to smith it. There are
crafted and other such pieces available for near that price on most servers,
which is tough luck, but one's time and pp can be better spent than going
to price wars with their FP.
