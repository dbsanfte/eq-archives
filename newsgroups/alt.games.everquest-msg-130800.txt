I've got to say that I get killed there at night all the time.  Kith is
probalby my least favorite zonse. And sometimes I have to go talk to the
Ranger in that house and I'm impatient.  At least I know where the corpse
is.

Died twice (and undinged my 30) trying to get my etched-ivy bracers.  And no
SoW for the CR then!  Damnit!
