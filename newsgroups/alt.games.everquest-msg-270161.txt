 From reports (I haven't played EQ2), you -can- help someone out in EQ2, 
IF they want you to (which was a player developed rule in EQ1, you never 
  help someone who doesn't want the help), and IF they throw away any 
possible reward.

The difference in EQ1, and apparantly in WOW, is that its possible to 
help out and still let them keep the rewards, and in EQ1, its also 
possible to "help out" someone against their will, possibly even taking 
the rewards for yourself on purpose or by accident.  Player consensus in 
EQ1 was that unless they said otherwise, people would rather try things 
on their own and sink or swim on their own efforts, and certainly 
wouldn't want to risk having some interloper steal the rewards of the 
fight by "helping" unrequested, whether honestly trying to assist or 
dishonestly trying to take the kill.

Perhaps most EQ2 players feel the same way; they'd rather try and 
survive on their own, and suffer death if they fail, then give up any 
chance at the rewards of the kill; thats a little harsher than the EQ1 
situation, where they -might- still get the kill, depending on what kind 
of help they get... but oddly even though the odds are better in EQ1 its 
still something most people turn down when asked.

Thats the "babyproofing" aspect of EQ2 people keep complaining about; 
they've bent over backwards to prevent people messing you up, and in 
consequence stolen much of the interaction between people, and made 
content more static; when you don't have to worry about a possible 
train, ever, there aren't as many surprises.

The claim people are making is that as you level up some more, you get 
to a point where soloing becomes impossible, or at least extremely 
tedious.  At level 9 you are still well under that point (most people 
seem to say up around 20, but Tim's saying as low as 13 here).

I can't see paying for 2 games at once, I can only play a fixed amount 
of time per month no matter how many games I'm splitting that amongst, 
which means playing 2 games is paying twice as much per hour of play.  I 
guess at 15 bucks or so per month I shouldn't care, but I'm more 
philosophical than that, I'm as concerned over wasting 5 bucks a month 
as I am about wasting 500, its the principle of the thing!
