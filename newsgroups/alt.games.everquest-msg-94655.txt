You make this statement yet you do not provide such proof. Oh yeah,
this guy's a real winner.

There are often events that certain people perceive as GM favoritism,
but it's always been my experience that they treat everyone equally

those have usually been reacted to heavily and swiftly by the GM's
superiors.
