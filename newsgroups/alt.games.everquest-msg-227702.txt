Agreed, there are too many headaches in building your own system. With
so many component makers trying to out-do one another, you run into so
many little incompatibilities between components. If you DO want to
have the satisfaction of building your own system - do TONS of
research first.

Buying a prebuilt system from a decent manufacturer is so much easier.
Getting support from one source as opposed to many is alot less
painful. You wont get the run around with the different manufacturers
pointing fingers at each other (well in theory).
