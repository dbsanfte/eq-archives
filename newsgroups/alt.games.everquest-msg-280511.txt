You're both right!  It's more reliable to use the mouse in
low-lag situations when you've got time to be chatting.

It's FASTER to avoid chatting and use the keyboard when you're in a
challenging fight and have to keep track of a lot of things at once.

The exception may be bards, where twisting by hand is more effective than
/melody, and requires clicking.  In this case, since your hand is already off
the keyboard, there may be other actions that are faster on the mouse.  I
can't think of any offhand, but it's possible...
