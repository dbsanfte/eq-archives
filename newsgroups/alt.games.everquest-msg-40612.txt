Wow, that's exactly the opposite of my experience.  I camped him one evening
for about 30 minutes (No one was there waiting on him), got bored, went off
and had fun, gated back to his spawn point, camped out.  Next morning, I
logged on before going to work, there he was, waited for him to move down to
the end of the long tunnel to the water, killed him there, camped out.
(Total time online that morning less than 10 minutes).  Logged in after
work, got my testament.
