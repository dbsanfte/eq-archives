He..He.. I like it, "coming to B2 with some friends, get ready to invite and
be *healed* (smack on
the forhead ala a revival style).....

I see now on the map going left is a better way, each time I died I went
right and
ended up on a corpse run.....one B2 group was so desparate for a cleric the
second
time I died, they offered escort service, but by that time I was having to
log.
