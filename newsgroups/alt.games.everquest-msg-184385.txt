To my knowledge (and I admit to not really knowing this) the pigs are
not muzzled. Said muzzle would make finding the subterranean truffles
more difficult, even for a pig. These truffles are found down to at
least 22 inches below the surface. Often the pig is so tired by the
time the truffle is unearthed that it must rest before eating it
(assuming it is ever _allowed_ to eat the truffle).
