I'm using OE5, and unless they've changed it, the easiest way is to do this:

- Open up a message from the person that you want to block.
- Under the "Message" menu, select "Block Sender"

If the person you want to killfile uses multiple email addresses, you may have
to either Block all of them, or use wildcards to get them out of the way using
Tools -> Message Rules -> Blocked Senders List
