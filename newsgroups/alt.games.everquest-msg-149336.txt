So, because a reasonably talented author has published a novel using
non-standard spellings to emphasize the distinctive background of one
of the characters, you're gonna just hand out good grades like cheap
candy to the millions of wannabes who claim imitation as creativity?
Adherence to fashion (and the use of slang is as much a function of
fashion as dress is) is the absolute <least> creative of all human
endeavors.
