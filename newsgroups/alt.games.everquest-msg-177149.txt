Make sure you make a hot button for that skill. Then just walk
up to a npc, target them, then hit the button. If you fail then it will
tell and you may just piss off the npc enough to start attacking you.
If it works it tells you how much you stole or the item you lifted off
the person.

It is best to not pickpocket the red conning guards until you are high
enough skill
