I don't know what you mean by that. I'm assumming you mean the lack
zone wide chat outside cities, but I don't see that as a problem.
Everyone who wants to broadcast something goes to the capital city.
It's like GFay and EC in one. I think the lack of /shout outside
cities makes the game more social or at least more peaceful. If I'm
lost or looking for something, it's easy enough to find someone in the
zone and /say works just fine. And there's still guild chat.

To address the original question, I think DAOC lacks content and
variety over EQ. DAOC probably has a better core system though, but to
people used to EQ it probably seems small and simple after a while.
