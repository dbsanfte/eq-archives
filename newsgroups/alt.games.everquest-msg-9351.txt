Even more likely, if it's every 15 seconds _exactly_ it's probably something
running in the background that "polls" every 15 seconds.  I had a similar
thing for a while until I figured out that my soundcard and USB ports were
on the same interrupt (not using anything USB while I'm playing Everquest,
but windows was polling the USB port as part of its "plug & play" system).
