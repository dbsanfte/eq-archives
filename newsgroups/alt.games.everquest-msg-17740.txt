That pet is nice when you are a necro at the same lvl, but you must be
way more powerfull that that pet, my skel is a lvl 12 one so he can be
somewhere between lvl 8 - 12 it seems, the higher one have been rather
good in lavastorm, he can take some beating without getting killed, i
never use mend bones, may be stupid but my mana goes fast enough
anyway :(
