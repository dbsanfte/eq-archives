I did level 8 camping the 4 skelly spawn in the SE of nek forest. Youll need
help to break the spawn unless you have some way to single pull. After that
youll need help if a mummy spawns too. Plenty to pull tho, and none of that
annoying "running away". Bone chips make good money too for that level.
