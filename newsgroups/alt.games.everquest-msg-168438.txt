You seem to be very thorough in testing/solving your problem but there is
one thing I don't see mentioned: The quality and/or speed of your internet
connection.

From what I am reading it might be your internet connection that is screwed
up. Do a few tests on your server, for instance leave a ping to your server
running for 15 minutes and analyse the results.

A simple way to do this is using this command at the command prompt:

ping servername.everquest.com -t > ping.txt

It will now show nothing on the screen but put all output of the ping to a
file called ping.txt..... leave this running for 15 minutes or 30 minutes
and analyze the results. Make sure you do not have any other programs active
that use the intetrnet, and make sure (if networked) that other computers
aren't either for 30 minutes.

Analyze the file. If there are many spikes of 500ms or more it is a
connection problem. Anything below 200ms should be good - I remember it was
around 180ms contantly from Europe when i lived there..... simply because of
the distance and pings traveling not any faster then the speed of light :)

This isn't always a fail-proof test but it should give you some insight in
your connection. If there are a lot of high spikes in the file you know its
about time to change connection :)
