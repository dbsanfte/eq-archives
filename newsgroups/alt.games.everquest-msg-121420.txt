My group got petitioned on our last Juggs raid.

There were a group of Chromatic Drakes from Skyfire
down there farming spells.  We tried to kill them, too,
and they petitioned us under PnP.  Something about
sharing spawns...

Hell, I don't even play a caster (for real, a naked wizzie
'port fiend doesn't count), but I think giving the mobs
spells that 90% of the 3+ year crowd doesn't have yet
when they haven't gotten out of their lair to Luclin or
somesuch in forever is pretty mean :-).
