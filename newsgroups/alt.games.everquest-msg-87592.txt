While a lot of people, perhaps even most people, play it that way, by
no means is it required. The world of EQ is huge, especially with the
expansions added. You could easily spend months on end exploring. Or
go on progressive dungeon crawls, or hunt in dank forests. Everquest
is involved and complex enough that you really can make it whatever
you want.
