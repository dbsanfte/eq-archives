Perhaps an Archer class, separate from Rangers?

Give them melee skill levels and armor similar to a cleric, so they can
melee in self defense if they have to, but *not* be a tank.

Give them Archery skills and abilities that would make them like a Wizard,
only they nuke with arrows instead of spells. (this would also involve
making the Archery skill....if only for that class...much more
powerful....leave the Warrior/Rogue/Ranger archery skill as it is, but
enhance it for Archers?)  Maybe throw in a couple of Ranger and Rogue skills
to make the Archer class interesting.  (Poison arrows, anyone?)

They would be like Warriors and Rogues, in that they would not get
spells....they would not be a 'hybrid.'

It would most likely be a class heavily dependent on groups, not a soloing
class.
