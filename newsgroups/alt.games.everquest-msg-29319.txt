The mob under the world one is a bug. The rest, however, are perks the
AI gets to make up for the lack of human intelligence. A computer will
NEVER be able to compete with a human in a game such as this without
being allowed to "cheat". Computers are pure logic, no intuition, no
strategy, no creativity. It acts exactly how it is programmed to act,
which is a *huge* disadvantage.

Example 1 does fall into the "standing on the roof and nuking safely"
preventation, by the way. If the mob couldn't hit you because you were
levitating that high up, you could float there and nuke without
retaliation. Example 4, I really don't know what you're saying....
