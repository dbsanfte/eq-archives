I know squat about smithing.  But, a 54 Pally in my guild is doing smithing 
and has been slowly getting his smithing up.  He was at 199, and he's 
gotten up to 207 in pretty short order.  He's making shadow-something armor 
in Luclin.  You have to farm no-drop shrieking substance and no-rent 
swirling shadows to make the armor, and he said it's incredibly cheap to 
make.

Pay a low-bie to kill the wimpy skellies in [ dammit, can't think of it - 
the zone where the PoK book is near Shar Val ] in the NE corner of the zone 
and get the no-rent swirlies from them while you farm the shrieking 
substance ( low-level sonics in Hollowshade ).

The armor looks way cool on a melee - he made a full set and gave it to a 
new ( as in, totally new to EQ ) player in our guild who plays a pally.  
Makes melees looks like Roges to me.  Kind of a dark blue sheen.  I'm going 
to get a full set for my rogue.

I think he said the trivial is over 250 on this somewhat crappy armor for 
that trivial.
