Well, for one thing, we are not a full time raiding guild, most of our 
members are part time players at best, so switching classes, and powering 
up to level 65+ with lots of AAs is not going to happen.

The monks are not unneeded, despite what you feel is the current state of 
monks.  The rangers are not unneeded, we are at a level where we need 
ranged DPS for some fights, and wizards are sadly a hard to find 
commodity.  We do have 4 or 5 bards in the guild, but, playtimes being 
what they are, we rarely field more than 2.
