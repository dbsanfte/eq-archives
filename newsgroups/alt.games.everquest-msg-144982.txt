Hail all-

I've reached out to some of you so far, but was recommended to post a
message here as well by some fellow Norrath travellers.

My name is Jason, and I've helping out SOE with some particular
aspects of the POP expansion.  Ove the coming weeks, I'll have some
*exclusive* screens and movies, as well as two opportunities for Q&As
with teh producers of the game. If you'd like some of these for your
website, email list, or just to have to share with others, please drop
me a line.

Notably, I'll also have a small amount of EQ tshirts and posters to
give away, as well as a EQ bomber jacket, limited edition poster
(framed!) and set of horsehoes.

IF there are any partulars about POP that you'd like to know, please
let me know and I'll do my best to find out for you.  Thanks to all
who have already responded, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind Regards,
Jason

PS-  even if you don't have a website, let me know, and we can work
something out.
