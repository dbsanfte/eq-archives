Thats a bastard of a game isnt it? It moves at an absolute snails pace and i
quickly lost patience with it. It has its moments though: laughed my ass off

Just out of curiosity, what creature did you pick? I liked the tiger,
especially when he was a fat evil bastard who threw his turds at the people.
