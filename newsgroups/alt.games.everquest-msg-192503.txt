Hello All;

As a noobie cleric trying to scrape up plat to improve myself, I'm unsure on
what to get items. I can find very little on this so I'm coming to the Pro's
asking for advice again.

As a 36 Cleric, in the bazaar I see items like plus 5 to Wisdom or plus 30
or 40 to mana. I've read where plus Wisdoms items are better for certain
levels then at some other point, plus mana items are better. My current
wisdom is 152 with the gear I have on. With items costing so much I sure
would hate to spend long, hard earned plat on an item and it be the wrong
thing for me at my level.

At what point is plus wisdom better?  At what point is plus mana better? If
I only have one choice to buy, what to buy?

Also;

Some items have a Focus Effect. I saw something like some kind of mana
conservation Focus Item.  What little I can find to read on Focus Items,
isn't this a random event?  Like, I cast a spell that costs 200 mana and
sometimes the mana might only cost 100 mana because of some mana
conservation Focus Item. Is that how these Focus Items work?

Thank you all in advance for your insight and suggestions.
