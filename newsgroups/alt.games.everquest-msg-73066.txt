Here's what they said donations would be used for:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
After much thought, we've decided to put up a PayPal button (it should
be over there to the left, under the other nav buttons ...), so that
folks who wish to help contribute to site expenses can do so. The
majority of this money will go to the lovely folks at Refplace, who
have been eating the expense of hosting this lovely community site for
the past year. A smaller portion will go to the DenMother to cover
expenses of software, time, and hair color to hide the extra grey
hairs earned while playing mom to the site. ;) It should be set to
accept credit cards as well as transfers from other PayPal accounts.
Please whimper on the boards if you have problems with it.
