And let's not forget that said hammer is way overrated. I get nowhere 
near the DPS of a paladin just using the level 56 hammer and yaulp v 
unless the paladin has really bad gear.

And let's not forget that a cleric meleeing will need to root, backup, 
heal pretty often when meleeing since we get smacked around pretty bad 
by mobs. That's mana dependency in my book. Cleric solo damage comes 
from MoR,pet and nukes mainly, not the uber hammer of proc doom. I 
haven't tried the 58 and 60 hammers myself but from what I hear they are 
proc more than 56 hammer but still no amazing dps from that. Also they 
drop from high level mobs, a paladin fighting those mobs would get/have 
pretty good weapons too and still outdamage the cleric.

I love the hammer for tradeskill farming and to occasionally break some 
boredom but it really isn't all it's racked up to be.
