I have a lvl 30 NEC with a lvl 29 pet.  It can dual weild and I give it 2 
rusty ________ .
Should I be buying better weapons for "Bones" or does it not matter?
It seems like my pet's damage is not like it was at lower lvls, but it could 
just be the stronger mobs I face now.

I solo my NEC most of the time so it does not effect others, but it does 
effect my life or death at times.

TIA
