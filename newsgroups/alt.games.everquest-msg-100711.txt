That sounds like a pretty fair 'best guess' total. Heck, round it off
to $500, because I like easy numbers.

I've upgraded hardware, but never with EQ as the primary driving
force. I'm just a hardware junky who does a lot of programming. Having

coding instead of gaming for all those hours and days, well, I'd be
able to afford an even spiffier machine!
