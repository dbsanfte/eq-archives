I've grouped with people of all the major guilds on my server in BoT.
I've never seen anyone use a pet routinely or haste it at all. Lesser
elementals sometimes get DCed. But no one can reliably heal a chanter
who had guaranteed themself aggro from a hasted MOb who can quad a
robe for 1kish before they're paste. This makes broken charm an easy
road to two MObs in camp and no CC.

In a full group with no pets, I can consistently get an AA every 2
hours or so with little chance of death. I'd much rather not engage in
disruptive edge play to eke them out a little bit faster.
