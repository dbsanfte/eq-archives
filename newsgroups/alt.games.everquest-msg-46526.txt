Not what I meant ;-)  I made it to level 5 just giving bone chips to the
paladin guild.  That took about an hour.  The 36 hours was the trip to
highpass and freeport.  That was in game time, something like 3am one day to
3pm the next.  Total real-life time was about 2 hours I guess.  And I got
better than 10pp out of it.

I dinged 10 last night.  I haven't done a /played but I probably have a
total of 10 hours in.  I got bored with him tonight though and played my
ranger.  My ranger is level 16.  I learned how to play EQ with him.  He's
/played at about 15 days I think.  He's strong and agile but kinda stupid.
