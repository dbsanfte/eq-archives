Having been in a "family" guild for over three years, from an equipment 
point of view I'm as good as unguilded. Whatever I can't solo or buy in 
the Bazaar, I just ain't getting, and that's the long and short of it. 
My guild would wipe to Skeleton Lrodd, even in the unlikely event that 
we could gather the numbers to raid Befallen.

Of course, if what you are in a guild for is the chat, a family guild 
can be a good thing to be in.
