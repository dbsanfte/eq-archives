    That no sane business (SOE) would implement a game with no motivating
factor to play the game. In EQ, the motivating factor is the nurturing
mechanic - you can grow your character to make it more powerful relative to
the environment. Take that ability to grow a character away, and people
become disinterested. Yay, I'm epic_ranger47 in the zone, with the same
stats and abilities as everyone else. As soon as you get the best gear you
can, declare yourself the "winner of EQ" and quit.

    SOE would also be reluctant to do this because, if there was an "end
game" state your character could achieve, that means that true comparative
class analysis could be done by the min-max crowd and the class whining
would get even worse than it is now. Right now things get fuzzy with
different gear selections.

    Bragging about what? "We killed Rallos Zek." "That's nice. We killed him
last week, because WE HAVE THE SAME DAMN STUFF AS YOU DO." There's two
difficult parts of EQ - coming up with a strategy to win an encounter, and
gathering the gear/XP to implement the strategy. Eliminate gear/XP, and
you're left with something that can be copied by almost anyone. As much as
uberguild players like to brag about l33t skillz or whatever, fact is once a
strategy is leaked the encounter becomes trivial to a LOT of people.

    They aren't the only ones sticking around for a shot at progressing,
though. Look how many low and mid-level guilds split up or lose members
because people want to progress to higher encounters. Even the most casual
folks I know that play EQ, a group of friends from South Carolina that play
together for fun, wish they had the time to do more and be "uber".
Time-starved power gamers are a larger segment than you seem to think. And
if those time-starved power gamers saw there was a stunted endgame, they'd
leave too.
