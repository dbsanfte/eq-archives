Basic monk pulling techniques.

1) Try diffrent angles, ranges , and if you have multiples see what happens
when you try to pull each individual one. Use feign to let them reset and
try again untill you get a small number instead of a large number.

2) For some mobs , when you feign they will stop and in some zones they will
leave hovering over you at diffrent times . This will split them . They may
remember you when you get up . A mob that has reset will hover again on a
new feign while a mob that hasnt will usually leave immedietely also
lettting you split.

Advanced monk pulling techniques (one of which got me yelled at by gms)

3) (non cheat) some mobs are casters . Casters stop chasing you to cast . If
you keep moving away from a group of casters long enough they will split
themselves. Then you or another can grab singles.

4)(non cheat ) 2 monks acting together can annoy seperate mobs from a pile
and run in opposite directions , this splits the mobs and allows one to be
tagged. This is by far the hardest method requiring simple communication
with a partner who can understand basic english . Such partners are very
rare treasure them greatly.

5)(the one i got yelled at for) Terrain features that a mob is trying to
path through stop them at the feature for a brief period of time and after
that brief period they pop on top of you . Both features can be used to
split mobs.If two mobs are very close to each other and you can shadow one
on a terrain feature you can split the other one off. If you can play with
several terrain features you can have a mob teleport to you where it can be
grabbed by another .
