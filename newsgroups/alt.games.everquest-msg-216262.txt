There are two problems EQ has historically suffered from with its stat
system.

1. Lack of information.

2. Incorrect information.

Much of what we know about EQ stats has been determined by log parsing, and
in many cases that goes directly against what the documentation claimed the
stats did.

This can be annoying when making irreversable decisions, like what stats to
boost at creation time, or who should get a NODROP item.

There seem to be three schools of thought on how games should handle stats:

1. Don't give the player stats.  Any stats should be hidden.  Player would
just know things like a particular items makes them feel more agile, or
stronger, or healthier.  The idea here is to be more "realistic".

2. Give the player everything.  No hidden variables.  The forumals are
published, so anyone can calculate exactly what effect any give stat has.
Some people object to this as being "unrealistic", and also on the grounds
that people can just calculate the optimum choice for every decision.

3. Something in between.  The players know the variables, and have general
ideas of what they do, but the precise formulas are not known.

The main problem with #1 is that players under such a system cannot really
play their characters well.  Say a Warrior has a chance to get a new sword,
that is heavier, but boosts his dexterity.  If this were a "real" Warrior,
with a couple decades experience fighting monsters, you'd expect him to be
able to swing the sword a few times, maybe try it out against some low level
practice monsters, and then *know* whether the higher dexterity is worth the
slowdown from the increased weight...his years of experience would tell him.
However, as players in a game, we don't have that years of experience.  We
have to decide from looking at the stats, knowing what they do, and
balancing them.  A game that hides too much doesn't let us do that, and so
we aren't really playing our characters...we are just providing a source of
entropy for the random number generator.

Yup.  The main problem with EQ's tradeskills (and those of DAoC, too) is
that they make the player do too much mindless clicking or button pressing.
Tradeskills have great potential for role playing and for being a big part
of the game economy, but they need a much better interface.

For skill-up work, you should be able to just get the appropriate
ingrediants in your inventory, and then in one command tell the system that
you are practicing baking or tailoring or whatever, until you've either used
those ingrediants up , or raised your skill to a specified particular level,
whichever comes first.  If you are using components available at merchants
in the zone, you should even be able to tell it to automatically buy
components as needed.

Routine skill-ups are like going to the bathroom.  Presumably, our
characters do go to the bathroom now and then, but no one wants a game where
we have to actually deal with that. :-)

That's fine for dumb animals, but if you are fighting a group intelligent
foes, like, say, orcs or gnolls, it would be nice if the mobs would use some
human-like strategy.  The human players won't stand by and just keep
fighting an orc warrior while the orc cleric keeps him healed and the orc
shaman is DOTing the players.  The humans will mez the warrior or ignore
him, and go take out the damned cleric and shaman first.

Much of this is an interface problem.  Compare to Neverwinter Nights (yes, I
know it is not an MMORPG, but that's not really relevant) or DAoC.  Quests
are a lot more interesting in those games, because the story is what
matters, not trying to guess exactly how you have to phrase a sentence using
the highlighted words (or, post Kunark, sometimes phrase a sentence where
you aren't even given highlighted words!).

Worse is when it finally does appear, you kill it, and it doesn't have the
quest item!  I like the way they handle this in DAoC.  Quest items are
handled seperately from normal loot, and the system knows what quests you
are working on.  If you are on a quest where you have to kill a particular
mob for a particular item, when you kill him, he will have that item, and
you will get it (same goes for anyone else in your party doing that quest).
The only time I've seen anything like the EQ type "kill over and over" has
been where the quest says the item is a rare item on a common
creature...then you might have to kill several of those creatures, but those
have then always been regular creatures, so it still isn't sitting in one
spot killing one over and over.

I hope EQ2's questing system is a lot more like DAoC's than like EQ's.
