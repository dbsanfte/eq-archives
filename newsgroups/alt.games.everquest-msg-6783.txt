As I understand it, it's a win2k thing, I've tried a couple different sound
options, one built in SB, the other an Ensoniq wavetable.  The Ensoniq
worked flawlessly in Win95, sucked in win2k.  Didn't try the built in SB
with Win95, but it sucks in win2k.  It's not just EQ either, anything that
uses sound that I have tried sucks in Win2K.  I haven't looked into it yet,
but I understand there is a service pack for Win2k, don't know what all it
fixes.  Oh, and on the original subject, I was running fine with 64MB on
Win95, with Win2k, other than sound, it runs great with 256MB.  The amount
of memory you actually need to run EQ well depends a lot on what OS you are
using, and what background apps are running while you run EQ.  Win2k is a
definate memory hog compared to Win95.
