Solid choices.

Nothing is 100% successful. Depending on the mobs you are fighting, I
would say Shaman slows land about 75-80% of the time.

Don't write of the SKs damage output. You have to add-in Pet damage
and life-tap/DoT damage to thier total DPS. The ability for SKs to
take and maintain agro is amazing, and will allow your casters to nuke
or DoT earlier and more often. 

Finally if your friend wants to play a SK, then let him. Everyone in
your group should play what they want. Otherwise your group will fall
apart over time. (been there, done that). Think about the time and
effort that it takes to build a character up in EQ....Do you (or any
of your friends) want to put that much into a character that they
aren't truly happy with?
