I wonder why Verant made the dropped Velium weapons not proc until 25?
The store-bought Velium weapons proc much lower (I've personally seen
them proc at 6, and have heard they proc at 1).  I think the store
bought ones are slightly lower delay, too.

I'd have expected the dropped weapons to be better, especially since the
store-bought ones aren't too expensive (around 100plat, which is nothing
when you are twinking your new character).
