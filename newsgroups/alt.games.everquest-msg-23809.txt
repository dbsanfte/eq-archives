I'll say it again.
You do NOT evac from a raid, ever.

Fear, unless you're killing CT, is not a raid.  It's an experience
camp.  

Tell me what the difference is between:

Seb Juggs - level 57, double 170, 17khps.

Turmoil Toad - Level 49 to 52, double 130 to 140 and 14 to 15khps.

Answer:  The god damn Juggs are harder.

Level 50 mobs stopped becoming a "raid" about two months after Kunark
was released when you had level 55+ people running around.
