In NQ the armourer has 2 quests for you - one to get some ink, the
other to kill bears in Antonica.  Someone nearby also wants the hides
of 4 Oakmyst Forest bears.  If you do these 3 (all easy) you get 3
pieces of decent armour.  Chest, belt and legs, iirc.

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
