An anecdote for your reading pleasure

Setting: Rivervale 8:30PM(EQ time)

Arandomdruid shouts Porting various send tells.
Me(a15druid) /tell Could I beg a port to Commons please, I would rather
not wait for sunrise
Arandomdruid /r sure meet me at the bank we leave in 5

Later on Same Day, I sold Arandomdruid a tailored backpack at a reduced
rate and got promised free ports for life.  

Also got my Ranger out of FV and back to the mainland.  couple days of
grouping in Lake of Ill manners and losing XP.  Soloing gaining XP. 
Loot only fair.  seeing Yellow Giants in FM and wondering why I can't
get a group together for over there.
