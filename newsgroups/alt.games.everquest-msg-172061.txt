Think there is also "apprehensive" (between "indifferent" and
"dubious") and "glares threateningly" (between "dubious" and "scowl",
still means will KOS if you get close enough to them but the aggro
radius is smaller than "scowls")  

("Glares threateningly" and "scowls" means mobs will attack you
without you attacking them first; with the other con messages, they
won't attack you unless you attack them first)
