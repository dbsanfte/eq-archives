I don't really think that is true. I think it is more a flaw with EQ
and probably will be gone with the luclin upgrade (whether you have
luclin or not, the entire underlying engine will be upgraded.. you
just won't see the new character models without luclin (except
vahshir, obviously) )

Nvidia is pretty much number one and the standard really. I really
wonder why people see those odd artifacts though when my tnt 16 meg
agp has not got them.. of course its a much older card but it uses the
exact same drivers. After voodoo went belly up I'd not make the high
cost investment for any card unless it was made by a chip maker
instead of a card producer. God.. matrox has not even come out with a
new card in a while have they? Someone keeps telling me to get a kyro
2 (which again is just a chipmaker like nvidia so probably a more
viable company) but I'm leaning towards the geforce 2 ultra to have
the most fully compatible card (and even fully 3d accel and supported
directly by nvidia themselves under linux for when i multiboot ;) )
