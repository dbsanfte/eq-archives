Ravenscale can take you all the way to 50, as long as once
you get past 45 or so that you really shouldn't tank many 45+
mobs wearing it.

As far as bargins go, Ry'Gorr is on par with RS, and actually
superior for all pieces but the BP.  Getting into pricier territory,
Mrylokar armor is great and can take you all the way to 60.
Mrylo arms, bracers, helms, and boots are all plentiful...all also
have some useful right-click effects that are useful, too.
My main and my alt both have Mrylo still for the spots that they're
already wearing better armor for, but keep for the right-click
effects (Helm for UV, Arms for STR buff, etc...and gloves are
_great_ for a long distance pull...and it's also pretty low
aggro, so I've actually been able to separate blue camps
from max range doing that).

Kylong armor is ok, but the real bargin is the legs.  16 AC
is SUPERB for the price most folks charge for it.  The next
up is only one ac more, Sebilite scale, and folks usually tack
on an extra 1-2k for the legs.  Sebilite armor is also all
around good for filling out those hard-to-equip slots...not
"uber," but definately good ac filler material :-).

Now of course, if you've got the cash, the matchless and
peerless line of dragon-hide armor can't really be beat
for droppable armor.  It most definately can take you to level
60.  Again, depending on your cash resources, any sort
of regen item is good, too (iksar regen is fine, especially
if you're messing around with a ranger friend and she
has to save mana for fear kiting, self-healing while she
tanks, etc...)...and nothing beats a Fungi for that. I've got
an ongoing dispute with a guildee about the effectiveness
of a Fungi over a Mrylokar BP (not all the Invigorate BPs
that rogues can use...my main has a Kael BP that he wears
for AC, but keeps a Mrylo BP to heal up because the Mrylo
re-cast time is only 6 seconds or one tick).  But a Fungi alone
(with smart playing) can get a rogue to level 45 or so.  Not
as quickly as a monk, because they can FD if they get an
overpull, but again, it's all about price anyway.

Last bit of info, and again, it's only if price/faction are good...
TBoots.  Unless your main will camp the AC for you and
get you JBoots (which ARE better, but not much), TBoots
are the most important piece of equipment a character
can get.  Rogues end up in many pick-up groups growning
up, and sometimes pick-up groups are populated by idjits
and weirdos...so Tboots help when that guy in Kaesora
says "Incoming Frenzied Straithbone" when your healer is
LOM...
