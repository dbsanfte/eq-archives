My ranger was my first, she learned and earned everything from scratch, there
was no bazaar, and I had no idea where East Commons was, much less try to
travel there to sell.  No books, who had 10 plat for a port?
I only used my bow and arrows to pull mobs.  They were the very last things on
my list to be upgraded.  If I had plat to spend it was to buy banded armor.  I
didn't have 5 plat to spare at level 4, for DAMN sure.  5 gold maybe.  Are you
sure you REMEMBER the bad old days?
