Why buy when you can make?  Don't clerics have a conjure hammer spell?  As I
remember it, my lvl 15 pally was using one to hunt wisps.  If its good
enough for a melee, it should be good enough for you since you're just going
to be on you ass most of the time anyway.  <G>

Its magic(for wisp and ghoul hunting), its cheap (free) and you can save for
your lvl 19 spells.  If I had to choose, I'd prioritize my purchases to
finish getting all my spells, then a stat increasing 1hb weapon, then a
standard combine or velium 1hb.
