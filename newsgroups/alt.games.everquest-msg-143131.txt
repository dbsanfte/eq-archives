<snippy> Well, now I don't feel *quite* so hurt that you were so quiet.  
Of course, my lip may quiver a teeny bit, just so I can enjoy guilting 
you.

Erm... okay, move the staff of living sands away from my head, ma'am.

Anyway.  I'd have to say that as soon as T logged out without waiting 
for an answer, he gave up his chance for the item.  Yes, taking just 
cash would have been easier, but he was willing to go into the bidding 
war, and, well, if he's got that much to offer, I'm sure he'll find 
another toy soon :)  Offering 200pp for the porter was VERY nice, did 
you offer it to the porter themselves, or to R?  The whole "priceless" 
bit makes me think he was just being a bitch about it.  Honestly.  One 
port in return for some unnamed favor?  Couldn't have been that much of 
a favor.  And he said right at the beginning that even if he didn't win 
the item, you didn't need to pay for the port.  Don't take it 
personally, it seems fairly obvious from his behaviour afterward that 
either his wife made him suffer vastly for EQ and he needed someone else 
to take it out on or (or maybe 'and therefore') he's an idiot.  And 
therefore, the better man got the item :)

Ryou
