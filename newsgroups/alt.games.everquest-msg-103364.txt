"....they threw that idea out...."? Not sure what you mean. The statement
appears (I am on FV server) so the idea hasn't been thrown out completely
and my impression is that it is active. For example, I cannot seem to get a
lightstone off a willowisp.

I guess Sailor Copper Hamster's answer is correct in as much as the item I
needed was dropped because of the TLC and that next time I might get it and
not get the Bayle List III, so I guess I should try again.
