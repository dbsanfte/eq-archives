    The current ones are simplistic - and sometimes that's good, sometimes
that stinks. In the case of buff icons, I prefer simple to busy - I want
something I can check at a glance if the icons are going to be made unique.
It doesn't matter to me too much, as I check my stats quickly and can tell
from them what I'm missing - but it'll annoy some folks.
