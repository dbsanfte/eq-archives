Might be server-specific to some degree -- I've been doing nothing but LDON
groupage for a solid week now and not had much of what you're describing. A
little but not much. This is on Saryrn.

It still does seem to me that a widely-adopted standard chat channel "LDON"
would help a lot in the LDON group-making, but apparently not a lot of
people agree. Such a chat channel usually exists on Saryrn but is lightly
populated. So for that matter is the LFG tool -- most players seem to
_prefer_ bopping around the camps spamming /ooc messages. Myself, I end up
forming a group most evenings, and between the chat channel and the LFG tool
I can usually form on without grabbing the /ooc spammers.


P.S. It is clear to me that the generalist classes (DRU, BST, BRD, SHM, RNG)
are ideal for LDON, and as a 55 BST I welcome this development of course
;-)....I think that realization is spreading as more players try out LDON
adventuring and see the importance of having a full range of capabilities in
a single group. Of course a tank, cleric and chanter are still the top
priorities in that order. Qualifying tank classes are PAL, WAR, SHD. So the
classes I see starting to get spurned are monks, rogues, wizzies and mages.
(Necros I'm not sure of, just haven't seen many of them doing LDON yet for
whatever reason). But druids are among the first classes I seek for groups
I'm forming.
