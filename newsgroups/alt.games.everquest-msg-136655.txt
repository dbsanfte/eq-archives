That's the first thing I ask when I group and usually someone in the group
thinks that what I really mean is: "Pull something!  RIGHT NOW!!!!" which is
pretty inconvenient when I'm generally set up for either soloing or evasion
if I am not grouping and usually have one of these setups when I first enter
the group.
I also ask if I'm needed to haste (if we have a chanter or shaman so they
can save mana) and am always told that they *do* stack.  I was under the
assumption that the hastes themselves don't stack, just extra things like
str or agi bonuses (depending on what haste song used) but am always told
they all stack.  I certainly don't notice an increase.
