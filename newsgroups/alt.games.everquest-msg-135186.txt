| EQ, why do you insist on using such loaded and judgemental terms as
| "homosexuel crusader groups"?   Despite being politically active, this
| homosexual thinks you don't know much about the different gay rights
| groups out there.

And the term "gay rights groups" is any less loaded?  Are you implying
that gays have less rights than straights?  Or are you, as that term is
normally meant, implying that gays deserve MORE rights than straights? 

| PS-- you're not really born into a specific religion in any genetic
| sense, does that make discrimination on the basis of relilgion any
| less wrong?

What the hell does that mean?  And whether you like it or not,
discrimination on basis of religion does have a founding in law much
older than the basis in law that discrimination on basis of sexuality
does.

| No, some people claim that, others, like me, don't give a fuck.  The
| first step of prejudice is assuming that all people with something in
| common can always be grouped together- "They".  The second step is to
| assume that "they" are all alike.

Actually, IMO you are wrong, and its basis is the same as how you can
group all whites as whites.   Simplistic?  Yes, but it works solidly.  
Your so called "second step" is based in human nature, maybe wrong, but
still it is in our nature.  It is only when you disregard your nature or
try to change the verbage because it makes you uncomfortable that you
cause problems that are built upon ignorance.  

| (PS- I think both the "nature" and the "nurture" people are
| oversimplifying).

My feelings on this are simple, and involve a difficult question, if it
is true that homosexuality is something you are born into genetically,
we will eventually reach the point where it can be predicted by a test
and corrected.  What happens then?  And more to the point, if some drug
is developed to correct the difference, would people actually take it?  

If the answer is yes, then perhaps this is a medical issue, if the
answer is no(and I suspect that in most of the "gay rights" crowds it
would be no) then the issue is social and environmental regardless if
its an actually genetic difference or not.  If so, I say that while it
is true that homosexuals deserve rights, its is also true that being
homosexual gives you no more rights than a straight person.  

Disagree with that and you are biased and bigotted.
