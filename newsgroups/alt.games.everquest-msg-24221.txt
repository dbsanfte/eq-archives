Yep, but we get damn good exp while clearing the junk.  :-)

Some of CT's drops are godly.
So much so, the latest version of Mecha CT is kinda hard to
kill--slowable CT was a joke for the loads he carried.

You see the biggest problem with places like SG, DN, Velketor is that
it's no longer empty.  It's crowded as hell--well not DN since it's a
pain to get to, but it too is getting there.  Becuase it's crowded,
you have fewer mobs more downtime and more likelihood of someone
screwing up and getting you killed.

Fear/Hate at least are relatively empty.  And only time you die is
when someone in your group or hunting party make a mistake.
Furthermore, mobs are very plentiful.

DN is fun.
It's a constant pulling situation.  A group that can really grind in
DN can do the same level of grinding in Fear/Hate.  Kendrick did a
very good job designing this zone, especially now that those
non-stunnable, gating roamer rats don't summon anymore.
