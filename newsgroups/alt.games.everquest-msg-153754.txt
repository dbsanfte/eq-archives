I wonder what they mean by "stellar interactive content"?  If CH were
completely removed from the game, those events would still use a healing
rotation--it just would not be CH, but some lesser heal, and might need more
Clerics (and Druids, and Shamen) in the rotation, but it would not change
things from the point of view of melee--it is still "hit autoattack and wait
for the mob to die" just as much as it is now.

Basically, Mage nuking is like Wizard nuking.  Good burst of damage, but not
high long term DPS.  Except, Wizards have lures, so by 55 (when we've get
our second lure), we can hit most things.

Fundamentally, DD nukes just aren't very efficient in EQ.  Mana is best
spent on healing people who are producing melee damage.

Well, there are some signs that Verant is growing tired of the uberguilds
always managing to figure out how to beat the high end content.  (Which is
odd, since that is what is supposed to happen...but perhaps people are
figuring out things faster than Verant expected?).  Read the latest news on
the Legacy of Steel web site.  Someone got warned for using death/res to
bypass content.  Geesh!  (And they've had GMs move corpses, or even poof
them, to prevent resing past content...including unlooted XP-bearing
corpses).
