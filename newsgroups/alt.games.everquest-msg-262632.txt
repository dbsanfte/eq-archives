There's no value in this intellectual exercise.  Iraq didn't have
WMDs.

What if George W. Bush is the anti-Christ?  What if martians attack
tomorrow?  What if the sky falls?  Who the hell cares?  The Bush
administration *knew* Iraq didn't have WMDs and *lied to us anyway* to
drum up some support for the war.

Sorry, it's not obvious to me, unless you're just trying to justify
George W. Bush's lies to America and his critical mistakes.

They lost their lives for a *lie*, not *for their country*.  George W.
Bush did the *ultimate* in dishonoring our men in women in uniform by
sending them into Iraq ill-prepared for the disaster he had to know
would follow.

And since you decided to become abusive, I'll end this response here.
Next time, maybe you can behave like an adult and have a civilized
debate.
