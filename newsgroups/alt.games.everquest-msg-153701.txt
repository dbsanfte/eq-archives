Im going on past experiences with Verants "nerfing"

Well we know for sure its a negative change, however much they effect us

No im talking about taking damage as you pull the mob, getting stunned adds
to that damage (if you cant FD because it will blow the pull, you've gotta
/disc stone and face the mob so you dont take max damage in the back.  That
should be fun when the mobs ripping u apart, it hurts badly now, let alone
with reduced mitigation
