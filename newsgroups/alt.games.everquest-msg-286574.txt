I leave my trader up for ages, sometimes two traders and sometimes one
trader and one active character on the same PC and switch between
multiple characters on multiple accounts all the time and very rarely
have *any* sort of issues despite multiple EQ instances on one PC
being completely 100% unsupported.

You need to differentiate between client bugs and crap that happens on
your PC.  The West bug for example is an obscure but verifiable client
problem with certain video cards at certain times but does happen.
