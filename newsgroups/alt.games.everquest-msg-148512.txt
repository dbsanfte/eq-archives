$1200 and up is what is charged by mom and pop computer stores, you
know the little ones. They can't afford to stock those monitors. I
forgot to say that the 15 inch LCD TFT monitors cost $800 at the small
computer stores.

I was at Staples, and the Envision EN-7100e 17inch LCD TFT monitor was
going for $979 Canadian. But if you go to a small computer store, they
charge $1999 for the same monitor. Too expensive.  I wanted to buy one
in the U.S. but the exchange rate is lousy.
