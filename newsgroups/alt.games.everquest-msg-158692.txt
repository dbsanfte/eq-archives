Wow, the area they'll be mining is, in your own words, a "small" area,
and yet five different forms of life are so concentrated in that small
area (i.e., found there and nowhere else) that they're in danger of 
extinction from the activity?  And you can't even say specifically 
which one(s)?

*cough*bullshit*cough*

"The corporations" and "corporate monster"?  *sniff* *sniff*
I smell a mindless knee-jerk Socialist.
