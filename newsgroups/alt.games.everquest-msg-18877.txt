Server is deity teams. All the halfling warriors that followed RZ left
misty and rivervale VERY quickly. Same with neutral DE's leaving Nek.

Try playing on Sullon and see for yourself...I had to help my DE wiz
friend (Sol Ro) get faction in RV so he could bank/use merchants because
it is virtually impossible for him to be in the nek/ls/ec area for too
long without ending up dead. He *can* go buy his spells from neriak but
its very hard and very risky.

The evil DE's outnumber neutral's about 15 to 1. Sorry, Nek is evil
territory....
