In addition to the healing power of a Cheal chain, aggro
control is increased by a chain.  A single cleric chain
healing every 10 seconds is going to get aggro... while
a pair of clerics, landing a heal every eight seconds, is
actually two clerics each healing every 16 seconds, each
less likely to get the love.  Three clerics landing a heal every
6 seconds are actually each healing only once per 18 seconds...
and have time in between to shoot a quick side heal out to
other injured parties in between casts.
