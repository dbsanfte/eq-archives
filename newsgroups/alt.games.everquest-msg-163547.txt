PG has synopsized pretty well. At your level the willows are also worth
doing. Collect hte GLS's and do the trade trick in NK to get about double
the plat for them (about 9.5pp ea). Not worth it xp wise for a while. As a
49 Bard, I focus nearly exclusively on griffon's (not griffawns anymore -
these are light blueing out on my now) and anaconda's. Willows are still
dark blue, but generally don't keep up xp wise. Griffs, snakes, and willows
all drop lots of research items, and occasional low end gem or jewelery.

Don't hunt the knolls in the west cave (with the BB zone). They are
basically friendly, and offer a bank, quests, and vendors. These guys are
very handy to have around when there's a war on (if you hear a war start and
don't know exactly what you're doing, then stay the heck away from the
villiage). Most of these were light blue to me when I first arrived in JP
around 44.

As indicated by PG, puppy paws are virtually a must if you're going to be
hunting anything but the darkpaw gnolls (the north wall gnolls). They help
all classes/dieties. Druids/Rangers of Karana should con amiable to a good
hunk of the zone without puppy paws, but still some things won't like you
much. I've heard that druids/rangers of Tunare don't get quite as special of
treatment, but my druid is so low I can't answer that for you. I do know
that my Wood Elf Bard - who often cons reasonable to bears and pups - is not
well liked by them in that zone.

Great zone, but be aware that you'll virtually never find a cleric there
(very much a druid/ranger zone most of the time, and only the poachers and
occasionaly the darkpaws will you see hunted by non-kiting classes), so
don't take unnecessary chances, or you're likely to have a no-rez death or
one where you have to call in a guildie.
