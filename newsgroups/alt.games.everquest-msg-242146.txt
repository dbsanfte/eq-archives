That may certainly be true, but honestly I think that's what internal
testing and having the test server are for. It is a tad disappointing to see
that issues reported on the test server have then been patched across to
live.

However they have a "dry run" house that they can test to make sure the roof
doesn't fall in, the plumbing doesn't squirt water over unsuspecting passers
by and the insulation doesn't stick to people when the build the final house
:)

Just musing really. As someone who works in software testing myself, I have
been a bit alarmed by the number of what seem to be relatively major bugs
that are making it to live. I wouldn't expect perfection, not by a long shot
of course, that would be unreasonable. At the same time I get the feeling
they shot themselves in the foot somewhat by releasing the initial patch too
early and bringing a number of issues across to live that they are now under
pressure to rapidly fix. I think when you're in that sort of situation and
pushing yourself for time, it's really not the place you want to be.
Personally I'd love to see them just take a little bit more time over these
things ( the initial patch specifically ). I'd have been happy to wait a
month or a few months more in order to have a less buggy dx9 patch when the
day came, and I figure it's got to be easier on their engineers!

Again, the situation quite well might not be exactly what I'm envisaging,
not knowing exactly how they work internally so there's always the chance
I'm missing something obvious here :)
