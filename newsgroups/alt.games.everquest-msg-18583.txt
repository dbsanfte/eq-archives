My 36 druid wandered in there yesterday to see if Gynok might be up
and was greeted by a horde of aggressive dark elves. Most of them
seemed to be necromancers. All deep green to me; I do not know their 
level range. The faction hit upon killing them was BefallenInhabitants.
I do know that these guys KOS dark elves as well. They even aggroed
on a 50-something warrior that came in.

Not for the faint of heart.
