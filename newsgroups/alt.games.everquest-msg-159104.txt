Well, I'll see if I can get a few more people to come with me but as for
making it to the arena...simple...been there, done that.  Everything up to
those four gaurds at the doorway of the arena don't see invis and even if
they did we've taken them before.  But as far as everybody's post, I think
I'll try and find a few more. :)

Thanks for the info
