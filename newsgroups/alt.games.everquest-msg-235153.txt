Hmmmm, I'd definately like to investigate that further.  I do know
that the other components of Verses of Victory (STR, AGI, AC) do
increase with Amplification.  It makes a huge difference.

I'll be very disappointed if haste does not increase as well.  In
regards to Bard's slow, it appears that mobs swing slower with
Slow+Amplification than with just Slow.  Of course, appearances can be
deceiving.
