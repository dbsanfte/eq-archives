For PoP zones, I'd agree, for nonPoP zones, I can handle haste on the fly, 
tossing in the slow as the mob arrives, then continue with hasting.  
Healing won't be necessary for a while.  There are some exceptions to that, 
but not too many.  Generally, I don't go to nonPoP zones for XPing, I go 
for specific drops or cash loot.
