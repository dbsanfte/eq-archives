Haven't tried these out (the new crafting changes are a full-time 
occupation), but in general abilities have been additive and there haven't 
been very many cases of replacements. I'm betting that they will just be 
additional abilities that show up in your socials list.

Everyone gets an apartment at the beginning of the game. The first thing you 
do when you get off the island is go to your apartment, where you're met by 
a caretaker who gives you a few sticks of furniture, shows you how to place 
them, introduces you to the banker and then gives you your first game quest. 
From there you're on your own. To keep your apartment you have to pay some 
nominal amount each week (I think it's 5s a week and typical noob quests pay 
11-33c each so it's pretty lightweight rent). You can at any time Relinquish 
ownership and purchase one of the upgraded Houses. From what I understand 
they are very expensive and require city status points in addition to gold 
(you get status points by doing city quests that yield SP instead of XP). I 
haven't noticed many players moving into the city even though there are lots 
of homes there. Maybe they're trying to make it more exclusive or something, 
or maybe they're just too expensive, dunno. The reason I haven't moved into 
the city is a) there are no tradeskill instances there and b) there's only 
one dock serving all of the city zones so transporation is a little more 
time consuming and keep in mind that your vendor is located in your home, so 
it's more convenient for your buyers if you're near a dock.

I didn't see any mention of the nVidia shadows problem and I haven't turned 
them back on yet. I'll try it again after the current hotfix. Servers just 
came down for a hotfix, downtime about an hour, so this looks to be a 
significant update.  I haven't ventured outside of the village today, 
running back and forth between the bank, my vendor's apartment and the 
tradeskill instance. I haven't perceived any kind of server side lag, but my 
general impression is that lag of the framerate sort has increased today, 
not decreased. I noticed a subtle, but definite increase in stuttering. Not 
sure why, but it might be related to the increased population on all the 
servers and all the items in town they wind up having to track.
