Well, first you're asking me to think that posting publically available 
information is "low" in some way.  Then you're asking me to believe that 
BS has lost an argument.  Both of those claims seem rather far-fetched.

}Can YOU think of any other reason for his disclosures, other then an
}attempt to intimidate me into silence??

Well, that doesn't hold water in the least.  Why would he want you to be 
silent?  He seems to rather enjoy your frequent public self-humiliation.  
Therefore, it must be some other reason... like, perhaps, annoying you 
into making an even bigger fool of yourself?  That could be quite a 
challenge, though, I'll admit.
