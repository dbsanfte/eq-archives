Druids should not be swinging a weapon after 20.  Very ineffective and
time-consuming.

The epic has a pretty good damage/delay and the few times I've used it
(when clearing yard trash on a guild raid, etc.) I have hit for about
60, but miss most of the time.  It's pretty much for show and for the
stats.

The only REAL use I've seen is killing a green skellie in the Commons
(who still, for some reason, think they can gank me) or something like
that..  /shrug..
