hehe...

/q should send a packet to the server saying it is quiting...  unplugged is
different but, if they want to 'fix' the problem,  put the old disconnect
code back in for 'blue' servers...

30 seconds until it senses LD and then you drop.  No LD after the 30 seconds
of no packets, just disconnected on non PvP servers.
