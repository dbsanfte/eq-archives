If your loss is genuine, I am deeply sorry for your loss.  This has been a terrible time for a lot of folk.
So maybe your not naturally like this.  Maybe this is the grief and outrage coming out.

I am sorry for your loss, but you are acting like an ass.  No insult.  Just observation.
I didn't say you are one. Just that your acting like one.

Maybe it's the grief...
maybe..

In the mean time I'll add you to the KF.  Nothing personal.
I just don't want to read your ravings right now.
