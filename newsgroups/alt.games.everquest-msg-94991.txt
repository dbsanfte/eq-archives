Well, Verant doesn't explicitly forbid it, but they did make a change to 
necro pets and feign death quite some time ago to deal with just this 
situation.  Necros found spots where their pet could easily solo 
exp-giving mobs, and would park the pet on the spawn point, feign, and go 
afk for some length of time.  People bitched, Verant broke out the nerf 
bat, and now pets poof if feigned for 2 minutes.  Verant specifically 
mentioned the reasons for the change when it was implemented.  All the 
necros I knew at the time swore they only used it for faction work, but we 
all know that necros are lying, death-loving freaks.
