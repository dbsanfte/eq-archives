Opt & Inis didn't fix it, but I did see an answer on the tech support board.
I haven't tried it yet, but I AM using a Radeon video card so I'm
optimistic:

----
The ATI hotkey manager can have a conflict with EQ.
You have two choices-
1) Install the ATI control panel portion of the drivers from Catalyst 3.2 or
earlier (i.e. the Catalyst 3.4 and 3.5 video drivers both work fine with the
3.1/3.2 control panel)

2) Disable the ATI Hotkey manager in XP. (Control Panel, Performance and
Maintenance, Admin Tools, Services) Click on ATI HotKey poller,
right-click/Properties, change Startup to "Manual" then click the STOP
button to halt the service.
