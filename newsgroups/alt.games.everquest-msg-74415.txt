This page has a bit of info on it:
http://gameznet.com/eq/class/warrior2.html
And this one is alright too : http://www.steelwarrior.org/

I have yet to find anything real spectacular, but those two have some useful
information.

As for in general.
I would go for Crafted Armor (or better if you can afford it). Crafted BP is
AC22 and has some Stamina and HP on it too..

AC is definately king for the warrior. I would rather have awesome AC and 2
rusty short swords, than Low AC and 2 awesome weapons.  Doesn't make a whole
lot of sense to be a warrior if you can't take the beating. Don't even worry
about stats at first.. Focus on AC and Resists (esp. resists if you are on a
PvP server).

Depending on what you have to spend... the new "Centi" swords on Luclin seem
quite nice for warriors, as well as the "Velium Warswords" too Other good
weapons are: Wurmslayer, Lamentation (1HS), Jarsinth (spelling?) Trident..

At first.. since you just got Duel Wield, I would try for a fast offhander,
if you can. Let's say.. A Centi Longword in Main Hand and a Ykesha in
Offhand.. The Ykesha should make your offhand move fast, and increase the
Duel Wield skill quickly. I think I would lean towards a well balanced sword
in my Primary hand, and something fast in secondary.. But slow and hard
hitting in secondary would be a good idea too. I am a 'getto' twink (as the
most uber will call me) but I use a Wurmslayer 25/40 in Primary hand, and a
Jarsinth Trident 11/22 in my offhand. If I am fighting in PvP against a
caster, I will toss the Ykesha in my main hand.. and keep the Trident in my
offhand.. I hit real fast that way.


Do a search on Allakhazam for 1HS/Warrior weapons (sort by ratio, ignore the
2 at top, hehe). Go for Ratios if you can.. Something like 13/25 Will do a
great job.
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/fast_search.html?classes=1&race=0&type=On
e+Hand+Slash&stat=None&order=ratio&level=&price=&qt=b&planar=y&bought=n&GM=n
&st=

The Wurmslayer is a good weapon between 20-40, after that, I think you will
need something faster.

As for weapons.. Don't forget to keep up training with as many different
types of weapons as possible. Never know when some real nice piercer or
blunt weapon will drop into your lap. A lot of warriors neglected
2HPiercing, but then Velious comes out with these crazy damage lances.. and
you gotta try to train in a new skill at level 50, ouch..

And if you really wanna make life easy.. Get a  Iksar Ceremonial Breastplate
(or Better) and you will slice through mobs like butter for the first 30
levels or so, hehe.

Oh! And don't forget some kinda haste I item!!  (FBSS, etc..)
