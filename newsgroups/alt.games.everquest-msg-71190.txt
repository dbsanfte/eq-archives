LOL.
Same problem here, my Altair just refuses to run it. Cant even install the
damn thing. For some reason my Altair shipped without a CDROM and I cant
even copy the game to through a network because I seem to be missing a
network port. Come to think of it its missing the hard disk as well.
Damn VI, what were they thinking when they made it impossible to play it on
Altairs.
