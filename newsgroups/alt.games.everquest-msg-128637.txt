Con does NOT predict the outcome of a fight -  Con is 
based solely on level.  A Black (or White) con is always
the same level you are, blue is up to 15 levels lower (at
level 60) about 13 or 14 at 55, yellow is 1 or 2 levels higher,
cyan is the 1 or 2 levels below the lowest dark blue, green 
for all mobs below that, red for all mobs 3+ levels higher. 

At low levels when there are differentiations in the dark blues, 
it is entirely possible to tell what level (therefore how powerful) 
your pet is, by conning it.

At higher levels you simply keep an eye out for your pet's
max hit - that will tell you its level and HP (if you take
a look at the pet table at the Mage Compendium)

For example, Vocarate pets range from level 41 to level 45
(without a staff of mastery).  The air and water pets have
max hits ranging from 48 to 56, corresponding to level
(I.E. a 41 hits for 48, 42 for 50, 43 for 52, 44 for 54
and 45 for 56.  Voc. Earth hits 2 points harder per level,
Voc fire is completely different)  

Knowing this and the level range of the mobs you're hunting
will tell you how well your pet will tank/hit them. 

A good example is Gornit (level 34-37 giant in OOT).  You can
tell what level he is by how hard he hits as well.  I knew
at level 44 (where my pets ranged 33-37) that a low hitter
had no chance of tanking a top con Gornit, so I always re-summoned
until I had a 46 or 48 hitter (36th and 37th level respectively)
