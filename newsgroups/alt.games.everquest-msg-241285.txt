The expansions part has been fully answered so I'll just add this about EQ2.

EQ2 is a PC game, it's the sequal to EverQuest. It will be set in 
Norrath hundreds of years ahead of the world you play in EQ following a 
major disaster...apparently kind of like the disaster which killed off 
the dinosaurs.

According to Sony, both EQ and EQ2 will be running at the same time as 
there will be a whole load of new servers opening for EQ2. I'm sure that 
in time, though it probably won't be immediate, EQ players will move 
across to EQ2, but I'm sure that will be a long time coming as EQ has a 
massive core of dedicated gamers so far. I could of course be proven 
wrong, but that's what I'm thinking will happen.
