Now that I'm finally 47, I can get any buff in the game to stick.

This being my first melee past this barrier (if you discount cleric and 
bard, which both melee about as well as a wet noodle if we want to be 
really honest) I'm not really cognizant of what this means in terms of 
buffs.

I'm looking for two lists;

One, long duration buffs I can pick up in POK and which will last long 
enough to be of practical value by the time I travel to a hunting spot; 
say stuff over an hour duration.  Last night I got an SOV that lasted 62 
minutes or so... I guess with a LOT of buff extender AA and gear that 
one technically qualifies.

hyperextended SOV

Whats the top level version of Brells?

There are numerous shaman stat buffs which I've had with 60 minute plus 
durations

Whats the name and duration of the top end Beastlord buff, that has hp 
regen component to it doesn't it?

Rangers have a buff line that includes COE which was great at very low 
levels, a long duration DS that stacks with normal DS; is there an 
upgrade to that?

I'm sure there's more out there which would be of help and fit on this list.

Two, short duration buffs from people around my level I group with.  I 
notice many buff casters only bother putting the buffs on people that 
they request.  What should I be looking for?  I mean, clearly I want the 
best HP/AC buff I can manage, and whenever there's a druid or mage I 
insist on a DS if I'm tanking, and I always go for haste when I can get 
it... but other than these and some shaman stat buffs, I get lost as to 
whats available out there which I should be looking for.
