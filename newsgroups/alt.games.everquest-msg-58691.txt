 It's true. It's also on the PvP servers now and not just Test. From a
recent patch message:

November 7th, 3:00 am
------------------------------

** Project M Implemented  **

Tonight we have patched something to the PvP servers that many players
have been waiting for. The ability to play that gnoll, orc, or the cute
and fuzzy rat. On your character select screen you will notice another
button in the upper right part of your screen called "Monster". Clicking
this button will randomly place you in a low-level NPC in a random zone.
You will be given full control of the creature to do with it what you
like. You may hunt and kill other creatures. You may even attack other
players.

Some things to remember when playing your own personal monster (NPC).

-You will not be able to interact with players or NPC's other than
moving and hitting attack.

-You cannot speak, trade, sell, or do anything else that a player can
do.

-You will spawn with normal loot for the monster you are playing and
Player Characters will be able to kill you for loot and experience.

-If you are a spell casting monster you might want to take a moment to
memorize some spells.

-Once you die, you will return to the character select screen where you
may choose to return as another NPC or play your normal character.

-You may gain experience, levels, and skills as this NPC, but once you
die, it is all lost. You will need to start over the next time you
choose to be a NPC character.

-You can't zone as a monster.  If you try to cross a zone-boarder you
will lose your progress and return to the character-select screen.

-Monster PCs (MPCs) can not loot, sell, or gain items.  They only get
what they start out with.

This ability to play a monster is being implemented for PvP servers only
as we have no plans to implement non-consensual PvP on a non PvP server.

However, we are still working with this system.  We may find other ways
to implement Project M on the non-PvP servers that are acceptable.  We
aren't done looking at the possible uses of this new feature.
