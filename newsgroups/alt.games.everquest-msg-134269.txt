Look what we have here. 

It looks like EQ forgot to change his nick back from Tanya Worley and has been
posting under that name for about the first 20 post here this morning. Look at
the headers, look at the post themselves. Guess this will lay to rest once and
for all the question about eq posting crap about his kids and blaming others.
The nick Tanya Worley is the one someone (eq) was using to talk trash about his
daughter, appears it was old EQ doing the posting all the time. Apparently he
realized his error at 6:45 AM (last post under Tanya Worley name) and started
posting at 6:54 AM as EQ.   The last derogatory post by Tanya Worley talking
about her mom calling her dad "Pencil Dick"
was at 10:27 PM on the 23rd, the first post by Tanya Worley was on the 24th at
5:57 AM but in this and other post EQ was once again talking about PC questions
as EQ. He realized his mistake and changed the nic back to EQ at 6:45 AM  How
can a man talk about his own kids like that and look himself in the mirror,
(assuming he actually has a daughter).
