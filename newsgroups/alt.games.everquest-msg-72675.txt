I spoke to a Camelot/EQ friend of mine who really does understand game
mechanics, and he said pretty much the same thing, only he also told me that
I had generalized *too* much. (and I thought that was a good thing, but he
said  NOT) He also said that some critters were susceptible to cold and some
weren't and that I needed to pay closer attention to the "attack" messages I
was receiving. He went so far as to log onto my account to see what I had
done wrong/right (he's a very good friend) with my elementalist, to check
her armor, stats, etc. and he said that I might as well bag her (since she
isn't even 5 yet) and start over again. He gave me some good tips, and I
intend to take them. But I think I will still find that I, like you, think
of Camelot as an interesting diversion. EQ will still have my heart. Thanks
for the tips, Kev, I will use them as I find my way. I remember the house
building in UO... I didn't play long enough to actually have enough $$ to
qualify, but my friend did, and I found it interesting.
