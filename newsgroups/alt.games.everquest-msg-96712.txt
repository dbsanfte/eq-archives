Actually, if you look at the one on castersrealm, the INT above 200 provides
the same amount of mana regardless of level.  I can't answer for the
correctness of this, as I don't have any characters with, in my case WIS,
over 200, except in the rare case when I have a WIS buff from an enchanter.

According to Castersrealm, INT or WIS above 200 provides 5.8 mana per
INT/WIS, regardless of level.

In the particular example asked about, he is better off with the +MANA gear
for everyday use, and the +INT gear for tradeskills.
