No, low blues are not the same as light blues.   The darker shade
of blue contains all mobs that are lower than you in level that
will give full XP points when you kill them.   The lighter shade of
blue are those mobs for which you'll get partial XP when you kill
them and green mobs are those for which you won't get any XP.

The general assumption is that you'll either know based on name
or experience which mobs are closer to you in level than others.
If you're hunting in West Commonlands, for instance, you should
have figured out that a "young kodiak" is going to be lower in level
than a "kodiak" on most occasions.   (There may be some overlap.)
Assuming both are blue to you, you want to kill the "young kodiaks"
and not the "kodiaks" for optimal leveling.

Given a choice, you want to scout mobs before fighting, etc.  You'll
see some mobs which are blue but have some white cons (or even
yellow or reds) mixed in.   Those are high blues.   You'll see some
which are blue but have some light blues (or even greens) mixed in.
Those are low blues.   Of course, some mobs are in the middle and
always blue.   And the only way to figure out if they're high or low
blue is to fight them.

The maxim "fight low blues for optimal leveling" isn't what's really
meant, anyway.   It's a general rule and condensed for brevity.
What the "real" rule is is this:   fight mobs which give full XP which
you can kill in the shortest amount of time with the least possible
danger with the least expenditure of mana in order to level quickly.
The objective -- for optimal leveling -- is to get as much XP as you
can in the least amount of time.   Killing four white-con mobs an
hour is nowhere near the XP that you'll get for killing 60 mobs that
are about to turn green and its a lot more dangerous, too.

A cleric will (or should) always pick a slightly higher-level undead mob
over a live mob, for instance.   Their undead nukes are much more
mana efficient.   Some mobs which are lower-level will have more HPs
and pose a greater risk than other mobs which may be slightly higher
in level, as well.   Griffins in the Karanas are a good example of this.

Anyway, its assumed you'll know which mobs are the lower ones in the
blues, either by name ("young kodiak" vs "kodiak") or experience after
a short time in the zone.   Or you can just look them up online and
know what mobs you should be going after...
