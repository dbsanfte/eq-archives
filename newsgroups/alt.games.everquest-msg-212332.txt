Actually, this is a basic tenet of some people's beliefs, such as some
of the Christian Scientists, that cancer and AIDS and SARS and many
others are the result of immorality or God testing them, and to use
other than prayer and devotion for healing is further blasphemy. To
judge others is also an immorality to some of them, so declaiming
someone for being gay is degrading to what God made.

It's all belief, so inconsistancies are accepted.
