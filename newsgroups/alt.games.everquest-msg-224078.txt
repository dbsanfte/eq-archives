<snip the whole sordid story>

OUCH. Man, I feel for you and wish you the best of luck in getting this
resolved. SOE's position on this may be well-motivated but it's just WRONG,
WRONG, WRONG and utterly stupid. I can't believe even the supervising GM
feels this way.

As a young Shaman working on his Epic now (just got my Black Fur Boots
today), I'm REAL nervous now about getting through this without screwing up.
I haven't MQ'd or done any of the turn ins out of order or multiple times, I
think. I mean, a quest that is done over a period of many months (and in my
case years), how can one be sure of what one did at every step? Sheesh.

By the way, in Star Wars Galaxies (also done by SOE) you can at any time
pull up a window that lists every faction value you currently possess. I can
instantly tell that my faction with the Hutts, for example, is -4500, etc.
If SOE is going to make the success of such a critical quest dependent on
your faction range, they could at least report what that is so that you know
if you're screwed going in. When I got my Black Fur boots this morning I got
a message that my True Spirit faction went up, and it suddenly ocurred to me
that I *think* I've seen True Spirit faction messages a elsewhere lately.
Now I'm wondering ...

Good luck.
