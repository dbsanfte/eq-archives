> Cleric - Dwarf or High Elf

Dwarf works for me.

> Druid - Halfling

agree

> Enchanter - Gnome or High Elf

Any race really. With all the illusions it doesn't matter that much.

> Monk - Iksar (I wish Vah Shir could be monks.....)

50/50 Iksar/Human - Human you have to get an item to make up for no
infravision which can be a pain, but better faction.

> Necromancer - Dark Elf or Iksar

Dark elf here.

> Paladin - Dwarf

Would have to say Froglok for Paladin.  Stats are far better

Only commented on the ones I've actually got as characters.
