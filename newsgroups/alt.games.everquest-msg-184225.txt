Lol, that reminds me of when I started playing, I was using a friends
account, and I ended up logging on his level 7 barbarian shaman... in
GFay... logged in next to an orc centurion.  And was still bound in
Everfrost.

Then I ended up getting totemic legs from some level 25ish guy that I saw
killing some barbarian guards and healed (at least I was smart enough to
wait til after the fight to avoid faction lol.)

So my friend goes and sells the leggings for 250pp.  Oh well.
