Hello,

I have concluded that EQ2 is heavily CPU bound and wish to upgrade my system
to the fastest processor available. I was wondering if anyone could comment
on
the performance of EQ2 with the higher end Athlon FX processors.

My desire is to be able to play the game at High Quality settings, or at
least balanced. Of course, on the isle of refuge, we can set our settings
very high, but
we all soon realize that as we venture out, and start playing in more
advanced areas, the performance really takes a hit.

I am currently using a 3.06 P4 RDRAM based system I have had for two years
(except video card upgrades), and can only play in 1280X960 at
high performance settings for good frame-rates. Lowering my resolution to
1024X768 doesn't really make any difference to my system, and I still can't
play at balanced or above in places like Blackburrow or with large groups.

I would like to stay away from the faster P4's due to the extreme heat
issue.

Any feedback would be appreciated.

I am thinking of keeping my Geforce 6800 Ultra AGP and using it in the
following system:

Athlon FX 55
MSI NEO2 platinum mainboard: Nforce 3 250 ultra chipset (AGP slot, not PCIX)
2GB Corsair XMS DDR400


My current system:

P4 3.06 533fsb
Asus P4T533-C mainboard
1.5GB 1066 RDRAM
Geforce 6800 Ultra (AGP)

BTW, I do not have a Geforce 6800 stuttering issue.
