Sadly, no, its quite possible to cast KEI on even a level one toon.

Well thats misleading, you can't actually do that.

However, KEI is a group spell, and only checks the Target for level.  So if the
level one groups with someone of high enough level (say, for example, the 60+
chanter casting the spell) and is within the spells AE range, then it lands on
him also.

Same principle would work, by the way, for the group version of clarity II
(gift of pure thought?)

And, to my dismay, it also works on Blessing of Aegolism, meaning that I get
begged for BOA whenever crossing the nexus.  But do people ask for the chance
to pay 100pp each?  No, no, they want me to spend more than twice as much mana
as the chanter whoring out KEI, plus go in pocket for 4 peridot, no charge.

Ain't that a kick in the pants?
