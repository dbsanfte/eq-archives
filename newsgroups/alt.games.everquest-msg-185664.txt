I suppose they tend to be more sensitive over that sort of thing in
the "good ole USA". Of course, this is the country where students have
tried to sue teachers for discrimination because they got an F on
their report. Nevermind the fact that their report was full of the
worst grammar imaginable and obviously copied word for word out of the
Worldbook Encycolpedia that morning before classes.... It's also where
they tried to push to have the slang that's generally associated with
black Americans made into an official language and taught in schools.
