I hunted in Misty for a while and I've found many Misty Acorns and I have sold
many of them. I even sold three for 10pp a peice. I have no clue what they are
used for and I am curious to know what they are for and what a good selling
price for them is. Also what is so good about orc belts? Are they a quest item
or what?
