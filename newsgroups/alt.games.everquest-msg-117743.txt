Hi Jazz,

thanks for the answer.

But I proved your possibilities several times. The right weapon was equiped
and the right mob ( there was only one that time ) was targeted. Also, no
spell was on me. I just have tried now with another weapon, the same result.
Will try again today evening, maybe it will be better :-)

Thanks for your try

Sincerely

Christian
