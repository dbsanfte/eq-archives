Froglok, halfling and dwarf are all quite good.
They have good overall stats and can all get to 100 sta 
to start. Frolok has ultravison and the others have infra.

Half elf has been done to death. Halfling should be 
pretty unique and remember that it has the ability to 
use racial sneak (vendors, etc) as well as racial hide
(though it can't sneak while hidden, only rogues can do that)
