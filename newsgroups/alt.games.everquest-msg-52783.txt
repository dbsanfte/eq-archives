I did get defense raises with the coat on during lower levels... but
can you imagine how frustrating it is to watch your defense lag behind
while the blue messages you get when things hit you tell about yet
another offense raise?

Heck, I'm certain it's an illusion, but it seems to have become a
placebo effect with me :) (Especially when not wearing the coat for a
few levels in my low 40s appeared to help me get defense up to a
respectable level. Getting only 18 points between 33 and 40, when I
wore it all the time, sucked. Defense was 166 and offense was 190...)
