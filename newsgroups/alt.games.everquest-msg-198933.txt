It has been so long since I have gated to the same zone I was already
in, I can't remember whether or not it clears agro :-P

Starting at level 18 (or is it 19?) you get your first "Evac" spell.
This will take you and your group to a safe spot in the zone and clear
all agro. Be sure to keep it memmed and that you keep enough mana in
reserve to cast it when things get ugly.
