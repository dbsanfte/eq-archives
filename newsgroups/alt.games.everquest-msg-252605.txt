My guild has a "normalized gear factor"  aka NGF.  Taken from my guild's
website -

Lottos are presently done using a Gear Allocation System. Briefly, this
system uses a Gear Factor that is obtained by dividing the number of raids
attended by the amount of gear received. This number is normalized to
compare the amount of wins a person has compared to others in the guild. The
Normalized Gear Factor (NGF) is assigned to the player, not the character.
Gear obtained for any alt will go against the main character's GF. The goal
of this system is to distribute gear evenly and fairly amongst our guild
members.
We do on occasion make strategic decisions about where loot goes, and when
we do it we do our best to explain why it's necessary. This is expected to
only happen when there are clear benefits to the guild for it to occur. We
don't do this arbitrarily, and trusting the leadership to make honest
decisions in the interest of the guild's progress is important.



Sidenote, when bidding, we go with 1-10.  Person who wants said item can bid
1-10, depending on hwo much they want it.  1 being lowest and 10 being
highest.
