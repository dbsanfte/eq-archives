Ok, what you say makes sense, but the question is, if they wanted
a melee damage dealer, why they would be interested in a warrior
or cleric, neither of which is a melee damage dealer.

Warrior is a sponge who happens to put out a bit of damage, but
nothing compared to a monk, rogue, or ranger.  Cleric is a healer
who now happens to also put out a bit of damage...

That aside, I still prefer your scenario; you just created a reason
for a more diverse group.  Previously you might have gone with
two warriors, now you have a reason to take a cleric instead.

Look at your same original group, only say its a cleric instead
of a warrior.  Now the same two guys come up wanting to
join in.  Well, they both have around the same damage output,
but you already have a cleric for heal/rez if it comes down
to that, what you are missing is a sponge... so the warrior
gets the nod over a second cleric.

Of course this all assumes the group is insane and doesn't
take both, so they can go after tougher mobs, what with
the new exp system this will now mean a lot more exp
to be had.
