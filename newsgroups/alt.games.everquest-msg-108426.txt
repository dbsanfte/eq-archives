Subject: faster leveling paradox

I experimented with some new characters since they supposedly made it easier
for them to gain levels.  I'm having a harder time soloing due to the fact that
I level faster than my fighting skills can gain their 5 points, making it
harder to fight MOBs at the next lvl.  So in all, this isn't easier for me.  

I know I can put skill point into training, but I have several reasons for not
wanting to.  Between offense, Defense, and at least 1 weapon skill, that's
already 3 points, and that only bumps them up 1 point each.  Also at the early
levels I like to put skill points into trade skills so that I can not fail as
much.  And lastly I like to save points to put at least 15 into higher level
melee/casting skills so they go up faster when the time comes.

So I am going to send in a FEEDBACK form asking that skills go up faster for
lvls 1-10 to offset the speed at which they level now.  I would appreciate if
any others who have found this to be a problem can do the same for better
results.

If not, oh well.  If you do, thanx.
