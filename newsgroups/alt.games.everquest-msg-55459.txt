I agree that they are kind of lame.  I put my 25 necro on the shelf for the
weekend, started up a half-elf bard and got him to level 5 in Qeynos.  "Time
to try out Blackburrow" I thought.  Step into QH and WHOA!  Where did all
these skeletons come from???  I couldn't even get to the crossroad.
So I take out the necro since I saw a big 'ol warbone skelly.  I took out
the warbone a few times and watched some higher levels take down Varsoon to
end the event 2 times.  No-one was getting anything good.  Just rusty
weapons from all the undead walking about.
I don't need anything handed to me, but this event seemed rather pointless
to say the least.
