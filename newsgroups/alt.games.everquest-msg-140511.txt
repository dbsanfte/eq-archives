My point refered to how you didn't agree with new ability to port to the
moon from Norrath. Simply dont use them then. Use the Scion despite the fact
they've made the spells available. If you group with folks, then tell them
you cant take the port to the moon because you dont think those should be
there, and you'll meet them in whatever zone....eventaully.

Unfortuantely MMOPRG are still far from "true" roleplay, but EQ is a great
"AD&D" fix until my RL group meets at the end of the month for some "real
RPG".
