I would and do agree with him on this. I have known it for sometime, how
Verant/Sony look on their players, how little they care for the customer,
knowing that they will always have a customer base. I know this and choose
to ignore it. Hell I use M$ products knowingly, Verant are like Phil, Prince
of insufficient light incomparison to the Big Gates Machine.

His reasoning for saying this seems to stem from that fact that other guilds
can now do an encounter without having to put ALL the hard work in, the work
that they had to put in. That is where I disagree, I agree the game is going
down hill as VI do their best to squeeze as much income as they can from
their players, knowing they will drift off to SWG and even other companies
games. I don't agree it's because people have started using Stormhammer as a
huge Farming ground, that sort of thing effects everyone all the way up,
it's just probably not been so prevelant in the end game due to the nature
of said game. I can sort of understand his frustration but I personally
wouldn't use that as an example of the game going to shit.

Nice to see he used English and not some expletive filled d00d sp34k. Just
think, if FoH had worded all their posts on their site in this manner, they
might actually be respected in the EQ community.
