It's not even a matter of ignoring Gardner. You can easily be a Wiccan
and have never heard of him. As I've said before, the Gardnerian
tradition and its offshoots are just a few among many valid Wiccan
traditions.

A person might join a Dianic coven, for example, and be well versed in
that tradition, and never hear anyone speak of Gardner. Not knowing
(or caring) who he was doesn't make them any less a Wiccan.

And they no doubt are. If Wiccans universally liked Gardner's
particular approach, then there wouldn't be all these other traditions
- we'd all be Gardnerians.
