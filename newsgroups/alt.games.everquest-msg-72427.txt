I played AC for about 30 minutes, didn't like it much. But I did like the
player housing thing. But when thinking off eq, why would you ever want to
buy a house, what's the point? The only thing I can think of is more safe
storage space. Wouldn't it be easier if you could just pay for a second bank
vault? And where would you put them? There is more than enough room in the
karana's, but I don't see a massive urban development taking place in the
tree's of Kelethin, and I'll be dammed if I start living under the trees
instead of in them, it wouldn't be natural
