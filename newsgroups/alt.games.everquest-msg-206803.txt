At 44 my line-up looks like this:
AE Mez
Enthrall (2nd mez, fast, cheap, and gives you time to work)
Tash (helpful to lower level Wizards)
Slow
Mem Blur (great spell!  Keeps you & clerics alive)
AE Mem Blur
Stun 1
Stun 2

I usually switch out the single target Mem Blur to cast
Clarity, IS, Insight, Haste, etc...
Sometimes Stun 2 is replaced by another spell (choke,
melee debuff, etc...)

At 24 I'd probably run my lineup like this:
(Knowing what I know now)
Mesmerization
Enthrall
Tashani
Languid Pace (maybe Tepid Deeds)
Memory Blur
Color Flux
Color Shift
Swap (Root?, Debuff?, Quickness)

This gives you some power to control and
dismiss mobs.  You can swap out Breeze,
Quickness, etc....

I don't use Tash often, but its nice to have around
when I need it.
Oh, I also use the Rune series a lot now.  I didn't need
it so much back before Rune III, but now big mobs come
and hit for 3-400 in one shot and it sucks my HP away
quick.  Another nice thing about Rune is that since they
miss their first few attacks sometimes you can get a
spell off before they actually do damage.
So something agros on you and you can get a stun before
they can hit again.
