I've seen repeated banker killing (and also repeated merchant killing
when the merchant sells something not easily available from other
nearby merchants) treated as zone disruption.  This is especially
true in newbie zones (GFay for instance).  Also true when the
players doing it admit to, or are obviously, griefing as in the OP's
example.

I don't think you'd succeed in petitioning someone for killing the
Runnyeye Banker either, since he'll KOS any serial goblin killer.
But if the OP and others had /reported and /petitioned the incident
mentioned I'll bet they'd have gotten a favorable response (assuming
there was a GM available to deal with it, but that's another issue
entirely).
