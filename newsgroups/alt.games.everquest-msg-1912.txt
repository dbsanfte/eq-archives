Just found a note in my files about 2h Weapon bonuses which may 
be helpful to those trying to figure out what 2h weapons are 
best.  This was from an update about 6 months back I think.

"2h weapons with delay under 28 had their damage bonus reduced. 
Weapons 28 to 39 stayed the same, and those with 40 or above 
getting an increase."

for example, Pac-Man affected kids born in the 80s, today
we'd have a lot of youngsters running around in dark rooms,
eating pills and listening to monotone music!"
