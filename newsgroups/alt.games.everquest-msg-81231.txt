As always this is a great tip, but do be aware:

1.  It'll fire the top-left hotkey whenever you move NO MATTER
WHAT HOTKEY PAGE YOU'RE ON.  So set up your hotkeys carefully.

2.  Likewise, it'll do so for every character you run, not
just the one you were running when you defined the alternate
"UserDefined 1" key.

So just plan ahead, lest your Paladin blow his Lay Hands
every time he looks to the left.
