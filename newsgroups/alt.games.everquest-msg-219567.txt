   Really?  How does a untwinked and unpracticed person do this?  Heck, I've
been play for about what, 3 years, most of it with lowbies, and I don't know how
to go to 1 to 10 in a hour.  Not even twinked.  Maybe with being PL'ved by
someone with a high level damage shield.  

   I wanna see you go from 1 to 10 in an hour with a new character on a new
server with no help.
