There are a couple of places (who's positions escape me atm.. I haven't
played in two years, and was an enchanter so could bind myself anywhere)
where they added bindablility oh, around Velious, to improve melee's access
to areas far far from cities, such as South Karana (a hot spot at the time)
and similar locals.

So yes, the Gypsy camp in NK counts as a bind spot. I forget where the other
one or two are though, sorry.
