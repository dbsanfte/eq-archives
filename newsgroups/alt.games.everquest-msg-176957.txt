From the shadows, the mysterious bullions27@yahoo.com (JBullions) (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

If you have both shaman and cleric you want your other two to both be
melees to take advantage of it. Warrior and rogue would be fine, but
any two melees would work. Don't take enchanter if you have both
cleric and shaman, you'll hamstring your damage output with only one
melee. Without enchanter its better to go melee heavy than caster
heavy, though mage would be okay. Don't get a druid, they would be
redundant. Other than that, knock yourself out.
