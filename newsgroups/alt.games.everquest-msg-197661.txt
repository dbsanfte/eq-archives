at occasions it is just that but more often it's more the interrupt in mobs
attention to be able to cast something awefull on the mobs. Slow it nuke it
get back to the mob to sustain afew more hits and hope pet recovers fast,
move back and land another nuke. It's mostly trying to make the best out of
pet and it varies quite a bit some are not that good and you would prefer
charmed pets, some are excellent.
