The 30-day trials include no expansions.  However, to find out what
expansions you have, you can go to the server selection screen and you'll
see how many expansions you have.  You can click the "Register Expansion"
button to look at a list of your expansions and register another one if you
don't have it.

If you're going to continue playing EQ after the first 30 free days, I'd say
get the Everquest Gold package (all expansions, a cool box to keep them in,
and a collectible figurine).  It only costs something like $50.  Not sure
that's the right price but it's something similarly reasonable.
