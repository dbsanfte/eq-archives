I was thinking of the Call of Earth line.  It does not stack with your
self-only DS, but it does stack with your other cast-on-others DS (and
with mage/druid DS).  It's small, but at least it's something.

I thought the ranger buffs had better +ATK.  My understanding was that
paladins had the best HP buff, rangers had the best ATK buff, and
beastlords had a compromise.  I would have guessed that rogues, monks
and rangers (non-tank melee DPS) would all prefer the ranger buff.  I
will agree that rangers have no parallel to the Spiritual Light line.

I'm trying to find a way to call this fair (i.e. the group is just
rounding out its skill sets).  However, this is really the worst
possible thing that can be said for my case.  A shaman wasn't perceived
to bring *enough* over already having a beastlord.

> I've been in groups in PoFire and DoN with BL tank/slowers.

I don't have a problem with a beastlord slower; we can do that job
acceptably, if not optimally.  I hope that the beastlord tank was
making the cleric sweat bullets.  I can tank things at the dark/light
blue border, but if I pull aggro in a group facing whites, I regret it,
praise every Taunt trick the warrior had up her sleeve, and back off on
the DPS for a bit.

I had thought your weapons were a much larger fraction of your DPS.  I
stand corrected.
