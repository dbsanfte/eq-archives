I started of at pottery when i started playing, and were the first to 
make Small Wis Deitys on my server, and dint have competition for over a 
month, made 10K to finance my druid, and start tailoring.
Then i made the rest of my money on tailoring, mainly because i were 
LUCKY on new recipes. Every time a new recipe came out, i were just on 
the level to start skilling up on it, and usually had little or no 
competition.

On the downsime, im level 57 druid with 119 days play time, and spend 18 
months getting there, and still only 238 tailoring.

Nowadays, you will need to get to 200 or so in any skill, probably 
higher, before youre gonna see any profit from it. Your competition wont 
the the master tradeskillers, but the horde of people getting to 168-185 
for the shawl quests, and are trying to recoup some of their losses.
99% of my combines nowadays i loose between 16pp (othmir fur caps, self 
hunted fur, stupid harmony nerf /cry), to 240pp, with between 0 and 
100pp income from them again, assuming i manage to sell my items.

So if you want profit, go hunt and sell your drops, will make you more 
money and save you a LOT of time. If you want to do tradeskills for the 
fun of it and dont mind the time/cash invested, go start and have fun :)
