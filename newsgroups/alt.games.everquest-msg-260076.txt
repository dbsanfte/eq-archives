There's an interesting dynamic in this challenge between Bliz and the 
hackers. Each side ups the anty and the other responds in kind and 
escalates. So I think that any attempt to rid the world of these griefers 
only serves to solidify further the appeal of the target. These guys live to 
grief Blizzard's world and WoW is where they've woken up and found 
themselves in heaven. (Lineage II is actually a better place for them to do 
this, but a) there's not enough visibility there; and b) they'd have to work 
hard there).

The issue at this point is not whether they know what to do, they do. The 
question is whether they have the balls to do it. Raph Koster presented a 
paper on the topic of administering MMOG worlds and in one slide he stated 
quite forcefully that you MUST loudly and publicly make examples of 
exploiters by banning them publicly (I paraphrase here), in order to create 
the right culture and discipline. And then when SWG came out and it was FULL 
TO THE BRIM with cheats, hacks, and exploits being used daily and out in the 
open, what happened? Did anyone "loudly and publicly" take action? Nope. 
Gotta let those sales ramp up. Disappointing. Brad McQaid doesn't fuck 
around, that's why Vanguard will be the game to watch, whenever it comes 
around ...
