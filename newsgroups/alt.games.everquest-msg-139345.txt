*shrug*  I used a Wrapped Enthropy Serpent Spine for a week or two.  (Proc's
blinding poison 3, same effect as flash of light, probably lasts longer).
At least twice before I stopped using it, in the middle of the fight the mob
just took off like a bat out of hell, running away from the group.  I
suppose it's possible that not just me, but every melee was out of melee
range for an instant, but not too likely I don't think.
