That's surprising...they have said in the past that they wanted corpse
looting to be slow and risky as one of the risks of dying.

I'm not sure I like this, because it is easy to accidently right click
when trying to inspect an item.  When looting my corpse, I sometimes
need to inspect an item, because I'll have two items with the same
graphic but different stats, and I want to leave the worse one on the
corpse (to keep the corpse around for a res).
