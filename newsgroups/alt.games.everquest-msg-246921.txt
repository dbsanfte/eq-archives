It still takes quite a bit of time.. and most are unwilling to learn
at that point because they think they know it all due to the ingrown
bad habits. There are exceptions.. but typically you get the 'don't
tell me how to play my class' bullshit.

Massive pulls in lower level LDoN usually just wipe the group and the
puller gets blamed. Most LDoN that the lowbie cleric is used to is
single pull.. low damage mobs.

>Having to deal with more than one mob where you see skill in a group.

Which is not for the most part early LDoN. Real dungeons you saw that
a lot due to repop in your camp, i.e. camping Hand in KC.. but with
LDoN and no repop you don't have to worry about the respawn add
popping while you fight the current single pull.

That is probably because he had come up in LDoN. Why would you see the
need for an AE when single pulling all day long?

I don't consider LDoN's 'real' dungeons. They are worked differently
then camping in say.. KC... they teach classes a wildly different way
of playing the game then real dungeons.. and as such.. they're more
just an exercise in clearing then anything else.

The timing that a cleric must have in certain situations is not
something you just 'pick up'. You usually have clerics either casting
way early.. or late. And if they get behind the 8-ball on the CH its
very hard to get themselves out of the hole at times without expending
a lot of mana.

To expand on the enchanter situation, most chanters who went the LDoN
route up through 55 are often not very good mezzers. The problem is
that most groups up to that level end up using their pacify to single
pull.. rather than pulling multiples and having them mezz. So they
really don't get the training in real world mezz situations that
chanters used to get in say.. KC.
