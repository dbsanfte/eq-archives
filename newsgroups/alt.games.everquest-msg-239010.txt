Actually I just resort to namecalling when someone makes an asinine
statement as you did.

Now if you actually had a point worth arguing, you might have gotten
something back. But "I don't wanna fight a mob in Hate"... come to
think of it, there is no zerk epic mob in Hate... I suppose you meant
fear? The mob is easily done by anyone who knows the trick. Anyways
that is not an argument for making an epic five times better than
anyone else's.

But I guess its easier for you to run and hide screaming "oh my god
NAMECALLING!" rather than answer the point involved.
