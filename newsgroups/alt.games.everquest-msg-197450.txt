OK, take my guild as an example. Mostly high 50s with a sprinkling of
60+es. Relatively small. We were planning to head for Tier 2 and had
already started selecting the people to go in the "flagging group".

The 60+es were either spending their time in pickup groups in Tier 2 or
else grouping in the low-end zones which weren't earning them any
experience. Nevertheless it's basically a solid and supportive guild.

However, we were extremely worried about getting support classes through
the trials. Shamans and bards were the obvious problem classes; solid
support classes with low DPS. We have a few high-end friends, but they
are mostly not *in* our guild, and asking them to spend the time required
to flag *our* guild would have been grossly unfair.

So we have a group of people who can get flagged themselves, since with
a good group carrying them they can get past the line... but who, gathered
together, may not have been good enough to pull somebody else over with
them. All quite loyal to the guild. All in it for the long term. But
all left in a position where the guild was artificially split in two by
the flagging process.

Or to put it another way, you are using an extremely narrow description
of what comprises a bad guild. Loyalty, is a requirement, yes, but getting
past the trials involves a lot more than loyalty. :-/

I more or less agree on this point, actually. Given a choice between
fixing the Trials and getting rid of flags, they should have fixed the
trials. However, Sony didn't do that. They got rid of the flags instead.
Personally I think that if they were going to get rid of these flags
they should have *only* opened Tier 2 (rather than also opening some
Tier 3 planes) or else added one or more new planes where high-end players
could exp without getting flagged.

By the way, while I haven't been in any of the trials other than the
Executioner, I did suggest it at one point while waiting for our "turn"
to crop up (in a pickup flag group). One person there said not to bother,
that he had tried some of the other trials and they were even harder. :-/

So we have the Exe trial with perhaps an 90% fail rate... and the other
trials which are less easy than Exe.
