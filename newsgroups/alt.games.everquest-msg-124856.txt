Was just wondering if anyone has experienced hunting up the East
Karana canyon? Not up the path to Highhold, but along the canyon
floor.

I've thought about going exploring, but I get worried that I might run
into something and be a LONG way from a zone wall, or any other escape
rout.

Should I bother considering the canyon, or is it just a lot of
emptyness.
