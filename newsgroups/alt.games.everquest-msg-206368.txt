here's one set of halfassed uninformed guesses:

i would think that your ability to level is a function of the game 
itself, and isn't tied down to what expansions you have 
enabled...course, i could very well be wrong.

i'd say no - thats a majority of the content on the luclin discs

hell if i know

no clue here...but i will say this in conclusion - my EQ life would be 
fine without velious (i'd be poorer though...i'm a big proponent of the 
velium farming plan) and kunark - but i can't imagine me playing now 
without either luclin or PoP...the bazaar/nexus and the easy travel 
afforded by PoP are incredibly useful - i played for a while with only 
the "Trilogy" edition...got luclin - was hooked....got PoP - was 
hooked...haven't gotten Ykesha yet though - i've heard its not worth 
it...
