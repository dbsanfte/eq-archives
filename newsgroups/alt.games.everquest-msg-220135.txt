It's not my fault all those other lazy idjets don't get their asses
off the couch and vote. Typically, less than 2/3 of the people that
are of voting age are registered to vote at election time. Of those,
just over 1/2 usually bother voting...

Of course, a lot of it comes from frustration over the people being
screwed no matter who gets into office. :(
