/blinks again

Not so different I think...

https://store.station.sony.com/game_index.jsp?gamecode=EQ

OoW  - 29.99
GoD  - 29.99
LDoN - 27.99
LoY  - 23.99

Luclin backwards are part of Evolutions and the 9.99 price is obviously 
not what they came out at.

And LoY at $24 *is* generally considered to be the mini-expansion. To my 
knowledge SOE has never raised the price of an expansion --how many 
people would *that* piss off :) -- which makes your 19.99 claim for the 
last few expansions bewildering.

Its also interesting, but unrelated to the discussion at hand that the 
digital download for Luclin, Velious, and Kunark are more expensive than 
the disk version though.
