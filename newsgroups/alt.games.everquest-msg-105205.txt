Actually verant just said that stats don't have much of an effect or
huge ac in general as part of an anti twinking design. However, it
makes no difference if you are level 1 or 60, they seemed to say.
This is why you could wear banded armor at low levels and be fine and
a warrior could wear only fine steel plate in his main slots and be
fine at level 50 still. 

On my troll sk at 36 i'm finding its better to go with crustacean
plate rather than any other armor, even if higher AC,  just because of
the HP it is getting from the stamina, which is useful since its is
about 190 stamina on average (seems to give more of a boost on the
higher end over 100) As it replaces this armor it will get things like
a barbed ringmail tunic which is 30 ac, so damned nice, and at 50 hp
gives more hp than the 15 sta on the crustacean bp.

Yeah, you'd need more levels and testing. Essentially what I've found
in playing EQ for years is that raw ac on items is not as important
often as raw HP. I was looking at the magelo of some warrior guy in
fires of heaven and of course for the most part his gear is quite high
ac ( think their leader? some level 60 master tank or something) He
had made some choices which kind of confused a couple melee types in
my guild; he obviously could have had higher ac legs than the 10 ac
ones he was wearing. When you looked at the 10 ac legs they had 100
hit points. I then looked at the rest of his kit and though by virtue
of the level of raiding they do it all had good ac, mostly it was
simply the highest HP by slot that he could have in the entire game,
while still having any ac on each slot. Only the legs stood out as
having low ac for a level 60 warrior in an uber guild though, the rest
of the best HP stuff possible per slot also had pretty good ac.

My druid is, of course, not a master tank but I've even started to
notice similar things in equipping her. At level 56 I can be at about
750 ac, with no problem, in druid gear that is good for me anyway and
such things that I've switched to full time now such as vellium fire
opal rings (ac 6 hp 65) I found that as long as I simply have ANY ac
in every slot I'm more than fine. In screwing around I saw that even
getting as much as 100 more ac really did jack for me, compared to
instead just wearing druid wis increasing items or especially HP
items. Since then when thinking about new equipment I've tried to get
whatever item has ANY ac on it, good wis (at 242 now so still not at
the cap of 255, though a c3 gets me there) and especially lately any
item with 20 or more hp AND mana is very desired by me.

I think I'm kind of sticking with the AC/HP model, but more the
highest HP armor while still being good for the class and having any
HP. I've been doing that with my cleric and at level 39 it has 760 or
so ac while still having 181 wisdom and as much hp in slots while
still having them be okay cleric gear. I sold off my mammoth cloak for
a cotiere generals cloak, which is 10 ac and 40 hp, an example of yet
another item which if it has a good amount of HP also almost always
has an adequate AC.
