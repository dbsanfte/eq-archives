NBG fails to be fair in any zone whose loot table disfavors one class or
another, and most zones are just that.  My cleric was invited to a naggy
raid.  When told that I would not be allowed to roll on the cloak of flames
(if it dropped), I bailed.  There was nothing else on his loot list that I
wanted.  Why would I go with any pickup group or raid where nice loot drops
but I am shut out of it?  Not gonna do it.
