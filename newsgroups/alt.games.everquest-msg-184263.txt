At 49 and 50 my wizard is in Mons Letalis (at 51 I'll leave for
quadding grounds but Circle of Force doesn't cut it for quadding at
50).  As long as you've never hunted Shiskar then the only things that
will aggro on you are Stonegrabbers and hatchlings (near the tower
there are some other mobs that aggro but I dont go there). Neither of
these can see invis so it is 100% safe to med.  On my server, it is
usually empty - sometimes there are 65th levels farming there.

I usually concentrate on Mature Rockhoppers (dark blue at 50, drop
rockhopper hides).  I have a stack of HQ hides and got about 5
flawless ones so loot isn't terrible.  If you leave the zone in line
and go to the back corner, there are few adds and you should be able
to kite there.  There is a hatchling trap (they spawn when you run
over the trap) over there so you need to scout the area a bit before
trying to kite.  Exp isn't bad.

Now, if you've hunted Shiskar, then you've got your wish about
difficult and dangerous since they are all over the zone and will
swarm you.
