My card went bad after 1 week of playing. When I went to return it, there
were 3 other people in line returning the same card. The store refused to
return / exchange it, telling people they had to deal with the Mfg. I called
their tech support and got a rtn authorization, they have now had my card
for a week and I have not received any kind of response as to when they will
ship a replacement. Also, no I did not overclock it.
