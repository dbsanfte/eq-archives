Best source of info I've seen is here:

>Berserk? what is it what does it do?

This is an innate ability that the Warrior gets when he goes low on
HPs that increases his damage output while under a certain percentage
of his HPs.

MT is usually a Warrior (often your best geared/highest level etc)
who will first engage the target and attempts to keep aggro until
either he or the target dies, most Clerics and other healers will
have them targetted for heals.  MA is the person you make an /assist
hotkey for as they will decide which mob to attack when several
arrive at once.  ST and SA are usually "Plan B" in case the MT and MA
die/go LD/AFK etc.

The reason you have for designating a Main Assist is usually to keep
mezzers alive as otherwise people tend to spaz around whacking
anything in range.  Also if a whole bunch of healers have the MA
targetted it means you almost always have at least one tank getting
overhealed no matter how screwed up the pull, most situations are
recoverable if you keep one Warrior alive long enough.

Attacking from the back is good for a few reasons: ripostes can hurt,
kick a mob for 22 and collect a 500+ riposte back, attack from the
back (or rather out of the frontal arc) and you avoid this.  A lot of
named mobs are fought jammed in corners with the MT hard against a
wall and everyone else hitting from behind.  Some mobs have extra
abilities such as Enrage (kicks in when the mob gets low on health)
which will kill a lot of people if they are both not paying attention
and attacking from the front.

Steel Warriors the board I linked above is an excellent source of all
the things you mentioned plus all other things Warrior related.
