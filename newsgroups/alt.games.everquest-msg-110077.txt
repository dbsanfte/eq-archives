Deep breaths

Okay.

The only reason to play eq is that you're having fun
*now*.  We've always known that eq had a finite lifespan,
now we just have a small glimpse of when the end might
come.  A year and a half is a very long time, to level
and have fun.  When EQ2 finally comes out, I'm sure many
people will stay, and I'm sure the live team will hang
around in numbers commeasurate (sp?) with the size of the
player base (and therefore the income).  I'd expect EQ's
player base to start to taper at some point (maybe even
before EQ2, depending on the quality of releases) and 
the live team to get correspondingly smaller, until at
some point they shut the final servers down and say goodnight.
I can't see that happening less than 6 months after the
release of EQ2 - that gives EQ a run of 5 years - pretty
damn impressive.
