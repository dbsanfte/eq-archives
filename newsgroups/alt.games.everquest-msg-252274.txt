Bleah.  I hated WP 5.1.

It didn't even begin to hold a candle to the simplicity and elegance of 
WordStar.  And if you look at how WordStar used to work, and how DOS edit 
worked, there's some pretty striking similarity.

The only editor I've found that was clunkier and harder to use (for me) 
than WP5.1 was vi.  And for pretty similar reasons, really.

But it's all down to personal taste.  I know plenty of Word Perfect 
zealots.  Their preference just doesn't make any sense to me.
