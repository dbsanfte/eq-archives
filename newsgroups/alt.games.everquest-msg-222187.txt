I have a level 15 Ranger (on Povar)...I'm pretty new at the game, but
I have found what I enjoy most while levelling is having a quest that
I'm fulfilling at the same time.  For example, I levelled up to 14 in
Crushbone while trying to finish my newbie armor quests (the Trueshot
Armor).  Now, I know all about Paludal's good experience, but I would
also like to be trying to fulfill another quest or group of quests. 
I'm not into EQ enough to spring for Allakhazam's Premium service, so
I can't really search for quests there and I can't really find any
good quest lists on other sites.  Any suggestions for quests in my
level range that are worth doing?  If I shouldn't try them until
higher level I can wait for a bit, at least I'll have something to
look forward to.  Also, I will group when I can but recently I've only
had a short time every night to do a little fighting, so assume that I
won't be grouped when doing the quest.

Thanks,

The Oneiromancer
