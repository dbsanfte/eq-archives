I had that bug once before as well, and so has Tiru. We play on two
computers hooked together through a hub into a cable modem, and it never
happened on both our machines at the same time. But we did experience it
once each, long ago. No idea what causes it, but each time it appeared
to the other one that we were moving noramlly, while the one with the
"bug" appeared to be moving well faster than Selos.

Then again, I've also had the "rain bug" a couple of times. It starts
raining. Then on her machine, it stops raining. But on mine it keeps
raining and raining, zone after zone. The only way to clear it was to
camp and log back in.

*shrug*

Just client side weirdness. I shouldn't worry much about it. You're not
*really* moving any faster. It just looks that way. The speed difference
cathes up with you on the client at some point, I'm sure.
