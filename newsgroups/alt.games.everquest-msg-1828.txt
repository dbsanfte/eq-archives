As long as you can get into the 200-degree radius that is "behind" him,
_and_ no other mobs are in aggro range (or are, but you are in the
200-degree "behind" radius), you can sneak and hand in as much as you want. 
Sneak is awesome.

Some hints, facts:

When you click trade, invis will break, sneak won't.
As long as you are "behind" then sneak is enough.
_DON'T_ hail the mob, it might turn around.
You _cannot_ re-invis to get out.  Using a potion will break your sneak.
You could get a non-KOS person to invis you to make your exit trip easier.
You're a _MONK_, if you can remember the way you came in you can probably
make it out alive.

Due to sneak my Iksar monk is welcomed in Freeport and Qeynos.  My ranger is
welcomed in Cabilis.
