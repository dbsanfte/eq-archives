I've never really understood that sort of hoarding. I mean for items 
that are actually rare, or expensive - sure hoard away... but most spell 
drops are reasonably common. Granted with mobs that drop spells for all 
classes it might take a hundred drops or more to get the spell *you* 
want... but everyone is in that boat... 

So I just go to the 'camp', collect 5 or 6 drops, and then if I don't 
get "my" spell, no biggie, I flip the ones I did get in the bazaar and 
buy the ones I need. Devoting hours of my time to farming my exact spell 
seems inane... and actually managing a collection of thousands of items 
just to potentially save fellow guildies a few lousy k seems ridiculous. 

Maybe its just me, but I literally cringe when I see bone chips, 
multiple copies of inexpensive/common/reaserachable spells, and piles of 
gear that's only worth a couple k in a guild bank... I mean whats the 
point? To twink people who haven't joined yet? Ok... fine...I can even 
deal with that... but when the bank is FULL why not just sell/bazaar/ or 
tribute the crap? Overflowing nearly worthless crap into mules seems 
insane.  

Just my opinion.
