    Insta-cast Invis means that Invis never drops on you, ever. That in and
of itself is great utility. But it gets better. If you use throwing items to
pull, you can invis between when you throw and when the thing you threw hits
the target. Because Invis forces mobs to Indifferent faction, you only pull
the mob you tagged with the throwing item. The Circlet is usable from level
20. How much would you pay for an item with right-click Harmony that could
also be used indoors?

    It's also pretty grim in PvP, where an opponent without See Invis can't
even keep you targetted. But most PvP players have a way of seeing invis.

    Even if a mob sees through and tags you, you can put Invis back up while
on the run. So you won't get any adds on you that can't see through
themselves.
