My guess is it'd come down to whether or not there is "intent to
mimic" the character. If you were running a high elven wizard named
"Conan", no problem. If you were running a Barbarian warrior named
Conan, then there's a problem. It'd also come down to what the surname
is. "Dabarbarian" or "Barbarian" would be a problem, as would "Obrian"

Just like a guy I saw running around named "Tihm". If he were any
class other than an Enchanter, I wouldn't have petitioned the name...
(Fortunately, I got a guide that knew Monty Python and saw the
referrence. >< )
