I've been doing LDoN a great deal as I roll thru the levels, and 
following discussion here about it as I go.

Having just hit 55, I'm noting a sharp change in experience; while I 
used to get about two yellow for clearing a normal mission, which 
gradually fell off to about one yellow, now at 55 I'm getting between a 
blue and a blue and a half.

Several factors probably at work here;

A) I haven't payed a lot of attention, and could easily have been 
missing the signs of a more gradual decline in exp.  How much was I 
getting at 54 or 53?  I -think- it was around half the "two yellow" mark 
I was getting in my 40s, but it didn't seem shockingly slow.  Nice thing 
about LDoN though is you are usually too busy to be glaring at the exp 
bar.  Still, I think I'd have noticed if it was down to say 3 blue...

B) My level versus that of my average group has been climbing; where I 
was usually the lowest level member of a group, now I'm often the 
highest level member.  Since we all get the same exp per kill, but my 
bar takes a lot more exp to move a given distance, this should be expected

C) Since LDoN adventures come in 5 level increments, B above is likely 
putting me in groups who's average level is getting us an adventure 5 
levels below me, while I was previously getting ones 5 levels over me.

D) Something else I'm not thinking of.

I've seen three different opinions about LDoN:

1) Great exp
2) Terrible exp
3) Exp dries up at 55

I'm experiencing 3).  If the people who said 1) are all sub 55 and the 
people who said 2) are all over 55 then we're all in agreement.
