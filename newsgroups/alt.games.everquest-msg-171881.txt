It may very well be a server by server issue. Innoruuk is one of the
oldest non-split servers. I am constantly seeing people advertising
"LFG (have KEI)" in all of the popular lowbie zones. I am also seeing
people booted and/or passed over for not having it. It just seems to
get worse and worse as time goes by.
