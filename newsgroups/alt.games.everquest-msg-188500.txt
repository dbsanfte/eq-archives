Of Rage And War
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

You got Lybia you got the Russians
You got civilian planes crashing to the oceans
Airports full of terrorists
Nagi skins anarchists
When are they gonna learn

Better listen to me you son of a bitch
Better disarm those missiles sleeping in the ditch
You have no goddamn right to do the things you do
The world would be a better place if we were rid of you
Of rage and war (4 times)

Every country's got the bomb
The scientists are working on
Chemical weapons to melt the flesh
With no source of defense
Shoot me I'll shoot you
Like there's nothing better to do
Who's the loser in the end

Better listen to me you son of a bitch
Better disarm those missiles sleeping in the ditch
You have no goddamn right to do the things you do
The world would be a better place if we were rid of you
Of rage and war (4 times)

War broods in foreign lands
Missiles launch upon command
Islam Lebanon what the hell is going on
Ambassadors who say they try
Negotiating suicide
Are they prepared to face the end
Of rage and war (4 times)
