About 90% i'd say.

Veteran players, not usenet veterans.  And there is no disrespect, you
can call a veteran football player a team veteran without
disrespecting hundreds of years of real armed forces vets.

Here we disagree.  I've used  usenet (and bitnet and fido and and and
before it) and witnessed hundreds of flamewars not one of which ever
made a grain of sand of difference to anyone involved.  I truly pity
those that take themselves so seriously as to pend their self image on
what is read on usenet.  Flamewars are mere byproducts of multiple sad
people who have nothing better to do that post drivel and insults back
and forth.  I saw 300 messages arrive in Free Agent today, I read
MAYBE 30 of em, responded to half a dozen.  I'm quite capable of
deciding what is going to be a reasonable post based on the tone of
the subject line, the past performance of the posters in a thread, and
the number of replies it gets.  If I judge a book by its cover and
miss a gem, it's sad but I got a life to lead after my coffee break is
over.

Quite frankly it doesnt matter to me.  I find it curious that you are
so starved for attention that you need to find out what I think.  

If you want to be a real man lose the anonymity shtick.  Real people
speak their hearts and arent afraid to sign their name at the end.  

I've done my best to provide reasonably useful information to the
'group, have tried to be reasonable with you and others who have come
here recently, and to keep my posts about the game and not about
personality. 

 There are those that would beat me senseless here for even giving you
the time of day.  Your spoofing of Lokari and verbal abuse of her are
beyond contemptable.   It disgusts me to betray the kindnesses that
Lokari has shown me with her excellent site in the past by even
stooping this low.  Were there any authority to be called on you can
bet I would be the first to report you. 

But there isnt and I cant.  C'est la vie on usenet, and we all get to
play nice in the big sandbox or fill it with cat litter, call it a day
and go home.  If I hope for this group to move on past childish posing
something has to be done, or I lose what little enjoyment I get from
my coffee break.  So, I have provided you with a roadmap, you can
choose to follow my advice or the whole 'group loses.
