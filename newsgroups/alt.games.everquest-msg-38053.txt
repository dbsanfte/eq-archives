And it just goes up even higher at higher levels.  On a recent
outing, my 52 Paladin (just dinged to 53, actually, but he
was 52 at the time) went out adventuring with 70p on him,
and by the time he returned to town had coins and "vendor
trash" items which resulted in having 999p to bank.  And
I had just been bumming around solo the whole time, making
no real effort to go after major loot.
