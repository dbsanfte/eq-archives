You know.  I never picked up on that.  Suppose he just forgot exactly WHAT
happened to it.

I figured he was foreign to the US, though I had no idea the software costs
that much still.  Furthermore, I haven't a clue what their bandwidth costs.

The best, or atleast fastest solution may be for him to just buy it "again"
and consider it a hard lesson learned for breaking/losing, whatever did
happen to it, something I have experienced once or twice, though, the stakes
were a little higher unfortunately. :(
