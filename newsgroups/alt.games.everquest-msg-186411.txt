Someone pointed out last night that Malos (direct upgrade to Malo) is
significantly more common than Malo even though it's a rune turn in.  Malos
only sells for 30-35k too.

Too bad Quiescence (100k) isn't the same with relation to Torpor (50k).

However, some of the rarer spells should be showing up a bit more often
soon, once the new research recipes start getting around.  I personally look
forward to picking up Levitation, Everlasting Breath and Remove Greater
Curse.
