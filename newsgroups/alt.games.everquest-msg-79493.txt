Dan, this works pretty much all the time? One of the reasons I hated Camelot
(no, not bashing, just making a statement) was that I could kill one blue
thing once just fine, but the next -same- blue thing would mash me to a
pulp. I've never noticed that that happens in EQ, so either I'm not paying
or attention or I've been lucky.
