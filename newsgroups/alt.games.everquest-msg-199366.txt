 It's not that bad. As a Monk I love pulling Sol Ro runs. Although I
suppose it's probably pretty boring for everyone else. Dresolik is a
pain though. His loot really should be upgraded for how annoying it is
to get to him.

 That's the best part of minis. We put bets on who will be AFK and die.

 Hmm so you rush and mez the swords? We just pull them and kill
beforehand, leaving Xuzl a pathetic wimp. His guards are tougher than he
is.

 This was happening to us too. That makes patch days fun. Because they
either do SolRo and risk losing PoAir minis to us or leave it for us
while they are up there. I guess they liked their PoAir loot a little
more than they wanted to keep us out of Fire.

 Well there are other ways to deal with them than porting in and killing
them right away.

 As someone already mentioned, try /key sometime. Then again, you could
say, BoT is also a key and the 85% thing works there. Perhaps there's a
secondary check.

 Well it's still 3k. Just spread out over 3 ticks so makes it seem not
as bad. That's fairly comparable to most of the other AE I've seen on
Elemental mobs.

 In the second field past the bridge the mobs are level 67 or so
(Yellow) and net you 3%-5% per mob, which is better than Plane of Earth.
However, they hit harder and have more HP so in actuality PoE, while not
as good XP, is faster XP. The first castle with the level 65 SolRo guard
looking things is basically equivalent to PoE XP from my experience.

 As for getting there, lev works fairly well. Getting out is a little
more tricky for non-gaters though. I'm actually surprised they haven't
patched this method out already. I'm fairly confident that wasn't their
intended way for people to get there or they wouldn't have made the
other way.

 Good luck. We skipped VT. It was a mistake in my opinion since AE is
owning us. But I don't make those sorts of decisions. I suppose it
depends on how much you've farmed already and how much competition there
is for Elemental zones and VT.
