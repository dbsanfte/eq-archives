*sigh*  I really expected better from you.    You were supposed to be
entertaining, or I could have left you in the killfile and saved my time.

After your strawman was defeated, not even dismissed...  since the absurd
position you chose was actually one that I met, even though I was not
advocating other people follow it... I expected you to come back with an
even more absurd strawman, like "I shouldn't have looted coins that someone
might have been able to spend on thier main!"... instead I get some pathetic
insults about how much more uber you must be than me.

Really disappointing.

Now, for this one... Actually it's quite possible to get geared up, without
ever setting foot in the bazaar.   My warrior was raid equipped, and would
have been considered "very well equipped" at the point when I stopped
playing him.  PoP mudflation has progressed since then.

If you want me to continue to spend time on this, you're really going to
have to do better.
