Ice Burrowers are definitely level 61.

There are quite a few animals that are level 60 and lower, the hard ones 
to find are the dire charmable ones.  Some of the rats in PoJ are DCable, 
Young Bats in PoN are DCable.

I know that at least some of the frogs in PoS are charmable by a druid, 
as we had one with us on one of our named giant kills, that DPS is just 
amazing.
