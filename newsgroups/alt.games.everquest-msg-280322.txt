Ok. I've searched and seen posts bragging about WinEQ, EQWindows and EQ 
Play Nice. Heck, I even found references calling those utilities 
unnecessary using the Windows Application Compatability Toolkit.

All I want to do is 2-box on one PC (P4/3.0, 1GB PC3200 Dual-Channel DDR, 
ATI Radeon 9800 Pro 128MB). I plan to run each instance of EQ from a 
seperate EQ directorie with the second instance having all eye candy and 
sound turned off. I want to run them both full-screen (not a window that 
covers the whole screen) and be able to switch between the two of them 
instantly.

How can I accomplish this? 

If all options meet my requirements, which one tends to do it better?

Do the MaxFrameRate settings make a big difference? What's this about a 
MaxBackgroundFrameRate?

I'd appreciate it if one of you multi-box veterans could hook me up here.
