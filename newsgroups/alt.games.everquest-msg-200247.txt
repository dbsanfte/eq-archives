I have one too and don't use it much except for botting on my other
account. For main hand, the keys are too stiff, IMO, to use to play
continuously in EQ. You'd be risking RSI much more than with most
keyboards, with the amount of force it takes to use the keys on the N50
IMO.

As to bannability of using it. With it's programmability, you could use
it to macro upping sense heading, spell casting, feign death or other
skills, and if a gm noticed (ya like that would happen, they'd have to
actually be on your server first) you could probably get banned for
using it, but using it strictly as a controller it's unlikely.
