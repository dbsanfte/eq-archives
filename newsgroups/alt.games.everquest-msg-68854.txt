To say I had trouble reading your words would be an understatement, but let
me address what I COULD understand.

No, I seriously doubt if you'll be able to re-spend your ability points
after spending them.  Don't ask "what if" questions...it's a waste of time
typing and a waste of time reading the answers.

You're level 51.  I don't know how far in so I don't know if you know how
much HELL level 51 is (it doesn't get any better, either).  If you do know,
I'll tell you that the Ability XP bar goes up much faster.  I liken it to
how quickly it moved in the upper 40s.
