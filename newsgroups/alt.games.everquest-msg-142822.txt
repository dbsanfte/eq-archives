Hell, I can't convince myself. Every now and again, despite their best
efforts, the music industry lets a talented artist release an album.

Well, so long as it's civil law, then the bulk of the money involved
should be coming from the private sector. When it spills over into
criminal law, Jane and Joe pay for it.

Which is why there are periodic attempts by the industry to further
criminalize copyright violation. As my mother notes (she get more
cynical every year, bless her heart), follow the money.

Well, they're doing it anyway, and they'll continue to do it. I
honestly don't think the RIAA has a chance of ever beating it.

Good point. About the only value to a performer that I see from the
RIAA is marketing, and once you're famous you don't really need that
service as much. You may be on to something.
