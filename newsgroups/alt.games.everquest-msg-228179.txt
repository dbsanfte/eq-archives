Of course, the percentages in EQ might have something to do with EQ not
being a game designed for PVP.

There was actually tremendous interest in the "Racewar" server when it
opened up.   It was so crowded the first week that they took it down and put
up two new servers with that ruleset a week later.   Thier populations
didn't drop until people found out exactly how bad a game EQ was for pvp.
