You're welcome :)

The big thanks really needs to go out to the Luclin dev team and all who
helped them launch the expansion -- I know they put in a ton of extra hours
and continue to do so.  SoL is very ambitious and while the launch has been
a little rocky, I think long term it will be a very important update for the
entire game.

Thanks -- nothing to announce quite yet, but I'm definitely going to stay
involved with MMOGs -- they're my true passion and as I've said many times,
we've only seen the tip of the iceberg now in terms of where these games
must and will go in the future.
