I don't know what level you are, but there are a number of things you
can do here.

One, heal everyone up before a pull... yes, its probably less efficient
than waiting till you can use your best heal and still not quite heal
someone... but efficiency is often overrated.  What you get doing
this is aggro free heals, the mobs don't hate you for having healed
someone before they knew they were mad at them.

Two, wait as long as possible before healing after the pull has begun.
Use a small heal if you have to do something... but until something
is done about mobs two and three, they have very little hate, and your
heal is going to put you on top of the list.

Three, make sure someone is doing -something- to those other mobs
as quickly as possible.  Mez, secondary tanks, root... something.  Until
this is done it can be suicidal to heal, and an unhealed main tank isnt'
going to live thru the fight.

Four, take action on your own to deal with the adds if you must.  You've
got Root, Flash of Light, Fear... depending on the situation and type of mob
you can handle emergency crowd control duties if nothing else is available.
If you have a chanter in the group, stick to non-damaging approaches to
this so you don't break a mes that just finally stuck.

Five, when you get it, Atone is a great tool.  Position yourself in the
pull path, root, flash, or fear one of the adds, and atone it, do it right
and you can forget it was ever pulled.... or in the case of root, it
will just sit there while you kill the first pull, and your puller won't
have to go far to go pick up seconds.  This can be done without atone,
but root breaks unpredictably, and without atone, that mob is now
headed straight in at the party, and has your name on its dance card.
Atoned, it will just wander off unconcerned unless you got too close and
got back on the hate list.

Six: Heal with your HP buff.  Generally these are slower but more
mana efficient than your actual heals, but they also have quite low aggro,
in fact if this is all you use for healing, you may find you aren't getting
faction hits when the mobs die. You have to be careful with this, make
sure the target is running -your- hp buff, not someone elses that you
may bounce off of, and that above all you have the -time- to get the
buff cast instead of a faster heal.
