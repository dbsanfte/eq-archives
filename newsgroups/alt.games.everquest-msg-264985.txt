Wow, you *are* a serious Civ player! I'm impressed.

Civ had all kinds of interesting little innovations. I remember when Civ II 
came out noticing that if you did a save and reload, the battles still came 
out the same. I thought it was cool that a designer would set the random 
seed at the time of the save to prevent the kind of save/reload shopping 
that happens a lot with other games and I posted on this in CompuServe. The 
next day Brian Reynolds responded and confirmed that's exactly why they did 
it. Now *that*'s a gamer designing games.
