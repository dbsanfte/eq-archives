There are currently 158 missing persons in Washington D.C. yet you can only
name one. If you don't live in Washington D.C. you have never seen the
names of any one of the other 157 in print. You have never heard one of
those 157 names on the radio or TV or seen a picture of one. There are
several young women known to have been murdered in the same neighborhood as
where Chandra Levy lived yet no one in the media outside of Washington
thought to report on any of these unfortunates. There's something different
about Chandra Levy. It's that last name, the tribe she belongs to, "The
Chosen People". She's just so much more special than the rest of us and the
media have so many of her tribesmen among them and in the highest
positions. They shape how we see the world and what we think about and how
we think about everything. They are our rulers.
