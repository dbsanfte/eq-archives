I have four criteria:
  * They must be polite.
  * They must not use d00d-speak.
  * They are not on my hate list.
  * It is not an inconvenience.

People who demand buffs ('sow me') will get ignored. People who use d00d-speak
('sow me plz') will get ignored. People who have pissed me off in the past are
probably already being ignored although I do keep a written list as a reference.
And if I'm out of mana, in the middle of a time important quest or preparing for
battle then the answer is no.

What will help get the buffs are
  * Ask in character, because even if you don't role play, I do (that is why my
name is purple and my guild tag is visible.)
  * Offer a donation. I will almost always decline, but it is very nice to know
you are willing to pay your own way and not just treat me as your personal buff
distributor.
  * Say "Thank you" or some other polite, fully spelled out statement of
appreciation. A careless 'ty' will NOT earn you any points.

In addition to my hate list, I also keep a list of "buff when I see them" list.
The easiest way to get on that list is be polite and stay in character. It
really is not that hard. I once had an orge ask me, "Need run fast. Please?" and
a DE necro once thanked me with "For a halfling, you're not a bad sort. I guess
we'll keep you around when we finish off the others of your race." and an evil
grin. Both got on my "buff 'em" list.
