Let's try this real slow for you junior.
UberCaster_01 has gear that would drive his casting stat past the cap.
Then he gets a shot at a piece of gear that would scrifice some of his
unused and thus meaningless excess +stat in exchange for a powerful
focus effect.  Do you really think he'd not jump at the chance?  Now,
very slightly more advanced, assume that his mana stat would end up
slightly below cap, do you really think he'd refuse the powerful focus
effect just because he might have to swap some other gear around?

Given that this is so painfully obvious, I am left with wondering
whether you are being deliberately insulting (on usenet? heaven
forbid!) or are you really the simpleton you are making yourself
out to be?


> This is not a hard concept.

Ah, it's both, you are a simpleton attempting to be insulting.
Nevermind then, I shan't bother to reply to you again.
