I never play during patch hours, but I would gladly have spent the day
harassing the login server instead of what I was doing: aka spending
the night after 1 am watching over our dog, taking her to the vet at 7
am, being told she needed surgery at 1 pm, having her survive the
surgery and bringing her home at 3.30 after being told she had a good
chance at recovery, and then have her stop breathing without ever
waking up from the anestesia a bit before 4.30 pm :(
