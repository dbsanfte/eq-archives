Remember being there on the night of a 1000 frogs when the added
frogloks to the game.  Was mad in the swamp that night with bodies
piled knee deep as the level one frogs tried to reach the pok book to
go and twink themselves in the bazaar!

Anyway, the reason why I mention this is about the speed of levelling.
 How long was it until the first Froglok made 65?  A couple of weeks?
