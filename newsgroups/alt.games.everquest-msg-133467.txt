Yeap, I've also seen it sometimes when I LD with little or no mana, 
especialy ifI was sitting down.  And I've noticed it seems to be most 
often when it takes like 20 minutes to clear the 1018 eror and get back 
in.  So I think sometimes your character camps out enough to disappear 
from other player's view, but sits there, still medding...  I do worry 
that I could get hit by AoE under those circumstances or something.
