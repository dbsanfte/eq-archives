Ok went into Utrecht today.... to get me Shadows of Luclin, and guess what?
NO store had it.... not ONE of the gamestores i went to had it! I went to
Dixons, Free Record Shop, Bijenkorf, Bart Smit, Intertoys and V&D, and none
of those stores had Shadows of Luclin.....

Oh I was so dissapointed when I came home :) I want to order it online now,
but i'd rather order it in The Netherlands since that saves me a alot of
shipping costs.

Can other Dutch buyers advice me where to get SoL?

Thanks,

Maarten
