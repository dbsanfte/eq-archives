That's not quite what I said.

Dark Ages of Camelot (DAoC) and Legacy Online, an obscure 2D isometric
city builder written by a couple of Cubans.  The later is obviously
not representive.

I'm not sure I beleive that figure.  It's probably just covering the
cost of hiring developers and ignores other kinds of development costs
like marketing and licencing.

There's are plenty of MMORPGs that have cost a lot more.  A recent
Forbes article(*) gave numbers in the ten of millions.  EA is supposed
to have sunk $30 million into The Sims Online.  Cryptic only had $7
million to create City of Heroes with, but NCSoft spends $18 million a
year marketing and operating it.  EverQuest cost $30 to build and $14
million a year to update.  Maybe these games all have poor management,
but if so poor management is an endemic problem in the MMORPG industry
and there's not a lot of reason for a company to think they'd do any
better creating their own.
