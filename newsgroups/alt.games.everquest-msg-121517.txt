And that elite subset of mostly secondary healers (since CH won't work
with focus) should be running around chasing an NToV INT mask, a
shitty Yael drop range item, or a VP drop cloak? /fume

(Here's hoping the Boots of the Dead Dream haven't been changed as

a sliver less unaccessible than the Shroud of Veeshan for most people)
