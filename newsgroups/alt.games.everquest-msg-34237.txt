Hm... That's a bit of a really big gap for me, 29 to 49... The reason
I'm toying with the idea of retiring my Druid at 35 is that there
doesn't seem to be much to look forward to until the high 50s, when we
get some form of Mana regeneration. It seems to me that we get most of
the really cool original spells by level 34, when we get Regeneration.
everything else afterwards is just upgrades.
