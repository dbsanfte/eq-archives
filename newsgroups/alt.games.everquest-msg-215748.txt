I have to agree with you here - I don't think the variables are as
simple as just average level.  I've heard a report from a 65 mage
that he got 2 dungeons of markedly different difficulty.  Both groups
had 6x65, but one had several people with 100+ aa, the other most
had just a few.  For reference, 3 of the people I'm almost always
grouped with have 130+ aa now.  Many (most I think) of my adventures
recently included a 65 BL with 100+ aa.  I wonder if I could find
a group of 65's with around 30aa (what I have) if the difficulty
(mob hp, max hit) would change?
