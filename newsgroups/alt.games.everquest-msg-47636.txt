You can get it back, either with the help of a higher level player  (or,in
the case of running off in it due to lag, I've twice seen GM's on the
Seventh Hammer get the bodies out). It's a thoroughly fucked up place to put
a level 50+ dungeon.

The point is moot now anyway, as the body rotted withing minutes. Never
twink a character less than level 6 =(
