Same here.
I was only level 46/47 when i got the silks. I simply started to ask in 
OOC if anyone got silks they didnt need, no replies.
Did it a few times, nothing happens.
Then i tried to explore a little (STUPID hole in the middle of the ramps 
around halfway up), and ended up at the Frenzy camp, saw them killing 
spiders and just leave them to rot, so asked the groups cleric if i 
could loot.
No problem there, could loot all the silks i wanted, so i got around 40 
in a night, just sat and buffed/DSed the groups while i waited for silks 
as thanks.

Next night i found another group that didnt need them, so just sat and 
buffed there, untill the cleric had to leave, so got invited into group 
as a healer. Got all my silks, and a few hours later we had a fulll 
group, and went to Village, where i got the Fixation of Ro spell, and 
dinged 47.
