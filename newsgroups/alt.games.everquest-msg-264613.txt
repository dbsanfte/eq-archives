Precisely.

The rune has 500 hit points. And all damage is assigned to the rune 
until it runs out of hit points. The rune cannot be healed, the player 
does not show as having more hit points with the rune up, and does not 
affect player hit points. (ie you throw a 500 hit point run up on a 
player with 400 of 2000 hitpoints, and he will have 400/2000 afterwards 
too. However, the next 500 damage he takes... well... he won't take it.

Finally if you cast a rune on a runed player, (provided its the same or 
greater) it overwrites the old rune with the new one at full hp. (so if 
you rerune a player with 400/2000 with a 500 point rune that has taken 
200 damage, ... you end up with a player with 400/2000 with a 500 hp 
rune on again... so you *can* chain rune to keep a player alive.
