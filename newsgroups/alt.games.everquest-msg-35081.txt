It took me about 9 kills to get the hilt. But just to be sure, there is only
ONE skeleton that drops the hilt, the one that spawns under the stairs where
the two Ogre Guards and a Dark Elf NPC hang out. On the eqatlas map, roughly
100,-100. Respawn time was 10 minutes, which meant I could get in with SoW,
make 3 kills, and get out before SoW went - assuming the Skeleton was up
when I arrived! The Dark Elf did not agro, neither did one of the Ogres. But
hide is useful ;)
