I call it Roleplay Lite; my characters have personalities
distinct from mine and from each others and can engage in banter
with the best of them if it comes to that, but normally you'd
have a hard time telling them from the faceless hordes who play
their characters simply as chess pieces or the latest Duke
Nukem.  Your best chance of seeing that I'm roleplaying at all
would be to talk to one of my characters and then another, and
notice the differences.  Thus, what I'm doing is mostly for my
own enjoyment, rather than as a show for the rest of the world. 
Since most people aren't role playing at all, this roleplay lite
mode lets me fit in with the crowd and play with them in a
Massively Multiplayer world, rather than restricting myself to
the few who'd be willing to play with a full fledged Thees and
Thous type of player with a straight face.

The other way people discover that I'm really one of those
annoying Role Playing freaks incognito is that there are things
my characters won't do, and when they explain how easy it is to
fix the faction hits, or ask why I won't do it since there's no
real use for that faction or...  umm, no, I don't kill dragons, I
explain.  Or another character might say "I wouldn't do that,
those are creatures of Tunare."  Or "they don't hate me, I'm not
going to get them started".  Sadly, this apparantly really wrecks
me for the (moderately) high end game, when in Velious, I pick
sides for each character and stick to that, despite the apparant
intentions of the designers that I first befriend the coldain and
kill giants, then with that gear, turn around and slaughter
coldain so the giants will like me and I can get that gear, then
turn about yet again, kill giants till the dragons like me and
get that gear instead, then kill more dragons that drop gear that
doesn't care who likes me, so make it so everyone hates me. 
Since this is crucial to advancing to the higher ends of the
game, my annoying desire to make friends and then not betray them
is a serious detriment... but up to that point nobody seems to
really notice.

Fortunately, I don't really care all that much about the beyond
65 game, or even really the beyond 60 game, I'm happy enough to
level up into my 50s and then start a new character of a
different class or race or both.
