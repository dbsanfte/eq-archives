Okay, since this is pretty much the only bone they've thrown in
for lower level characters, I'm figuring this is where they've
hidden the "stealth exploits" for this expansion.  You know, like
when GoD came out and people discovered that some items had truly
ridiculous tribute values, or that fishing in Abysmal Sea and
Natimbi paid off in hundreds of plat per hour?  (Instead of the
current situation where you can make hundreds of tribute per hour,
which admittedly is still not bad.)

I have a theory that says that SOE deliberately includes exploits
like those in each expansion, expecting that people will learn of
them through word of mouth, driving up sales of the expansion.
And once they've gotten enough sales, and/or when the exploits
become too well known and are threatening to break the game because
everyone is using them, they break out the nerf bat.

So, how long will it be before someone finds the Task Master who
tells you to click your heels three times and you make a million
plat, or some similarly unbalanced reward for a trivial task?
Past experience (the best kind, of course :-) suggests that word
will reach me just in time to sucker me into buying OOW on the
night they're about to issue the patch.

Anyway, I hope I'm wrong.  Maybe I just got out on the cynical side
of bed this morning. :-)
