}If Gore is just an overgrown Vox (we haven't done her yet), not only would
}you want to ToT her, but also Mana Sieve constantly.  Recast time is slow,
}but not horribly so (maybe 10 seconds...don't feel like looking) and removes
}about the same amount of mana per cast as ToT (last I looked, ToT took about
}50 more).

Mana Seive:  Cast time 3 sec, recast 8 sec, 370 mana at lvl 60
ToT:         Cast time 2 sec, recast 2 min, 400 mana at lvl 60

One other difference:  according to lucy, MS has no resistance check, and 
ToT saves vs. magic, although it's adjusted to be a very low check 
(Magic-1000).

}For Vox, the raid's going to fail without 3 sieving enchanters...I don't
}know what Gore's mana pool is like.
