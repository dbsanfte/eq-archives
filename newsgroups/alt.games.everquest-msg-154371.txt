What?! You're kidding, right? You think they put exploitable items
into the game thinking they could prevent any who discover the exploit
from spreading the information? That's a ridiculous theory.

Come on, people. They are only human too and as such are not
omnipotent and can't foresee what griefers or simply clever players
may come up with. When it happens, they do what they can to fix it.
Simple as that. 400k players *will* discover things that the team of
developers might overlook.
