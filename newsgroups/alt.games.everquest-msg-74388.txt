Does anyone have any information on this item?

Thin Boned Rod
Magic Item
All/All
Charges 3
Procs: Lifeflux

I picked one up in Erud's Crossing last yesterday, but can't find any
information/pricing anywhere in game, or on the web.  Just curious if it was
something new, as I saw some strange drops yesterday (Orcs dropping Kodiac
Claws and Rusty Knuckles, Chain Mail, etc)

Thanks for the help...
