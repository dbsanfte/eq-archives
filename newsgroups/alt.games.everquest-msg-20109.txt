It's a game.  Wandering around doing a CR (corpse recovery) on a level 4
"rouge" isn't fun.  It's a game...games are supposed to be fun.

You could have recovered your corpse all by yourself. You've had the Sneak
skill since level 1, use it to get close enough to do the /corpse command.

Now, I understand you're new.  That's cool, welcome.  Feel free to ask
questions in game and here.  Just don't expect ANYONE to take one step out
of their way to waste time recovering "rouge" stuff when the "rouge" is
perfectly capable of doing it themselves.

Rogues are a fun class but you have to do research on it to see what you're
capable of.  http://eq.castersrealm.com is one place you can find help.
There's a famous rogue site around somewhere, but I forget its URL.
