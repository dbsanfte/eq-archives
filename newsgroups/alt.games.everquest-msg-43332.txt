My dark elf, innoruuk worshipping shadow knight has never killed a
derv. She is indifferent to dervs, can sell with one of the gypsies in
Oasis, (IIRC, the others don't like her), and madmen damn their eyes
whenever they gaze upon her beauty.

My druid is/was also a madmen target, killed dervs and can still deal
with every gypsy in Oasis and North Karana; I think she cons
indifferent to all of them.
