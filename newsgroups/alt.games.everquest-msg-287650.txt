]Hmm.  What kind of differences are there?

I don't play EQ 2, so I don't know. There are several discussions
about the differences on the official EQ 1 SOE forums, in The
Newbie Zone.

Station pass gets you monthly access to all SOE games. You just
have to buy the expansions. EQ 1 now has all expansions as part
of each new expansion, the new one shows up in October/November
now. So you pay 40 dolalrs, and get all expansions. I don't know
if EQ 2 does something similar.
