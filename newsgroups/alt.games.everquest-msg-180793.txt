What's the max for clerics? I know monks and warriors go to 200, but my
wizard has a max of 100. (Had that maxed for ages, trust me. I'm
currently getting First Aid 3 as an AA skill. he he.) Not sure what the
max for you priest types is. Of course, most of the priests probably
don't know either, since they have heal spells from day one.
