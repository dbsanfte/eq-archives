Ok, played EQ for a few this morning, bought a couple pcs of Blood
Ember armor and all.    Then I went to work.

I come home, and the new little "Patching" box just hangs.   After a
few minutes of looking it declares there is no internet connection.

Web, E-mail, Newgroups, Ultima Online, everything else works just fine
(cept UO, which hasnt worked well in awhile, lol)..

So then I figure the "couldnt find Luclin files" message I got
yesterday actually meant something, even tho my being able to die in
Maiden's Eye was curiously working fine.   So I reinstalled Luclin.

Now, when I launch EQ, it will take a few minutes for the new patcher
to come up, and when it does, it hangs for a minute or so, then it too
declares no internet connection, and says "error parsing XML file".

But then the "Play" button lights up, so I go ahead and hit it, only
to be shown only Test_2 and Test servers.   I try and log onto one of
the servers, but nope... no internet connection again.    So then I go
into the chat servers, nothing related about my problem, just people
asking for world-boots, and whining about not being able to play.   

Whats goin on?   Why am I only able to get the test servers on my
choose world screen?   Why do cant some parts of EQ find the internet
connection, while the log-in server can?   I trace-routed all of the
IP addresses from EQ's support pages (last digit 001).

Yes, ive seen the posts about NAT, but my Linksys wireless Lan has
been working flawlessly.

Any ideas?

Thanks In Advance
