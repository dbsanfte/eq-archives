Greetings,
    According to Caster's Realm, Sony had a power outage and they are trying
to get everything up. What luck, I am on vacation and would like to get a
few things done. So is the nature of the internet and technology ;p
    Good hunting, exploring or whatever it is you like to do!
                                                        CommDon
