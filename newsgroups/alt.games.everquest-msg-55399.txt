Interesting. I'd read that rule to be more along the lines of "title"
meaning a medieval or current "title" of power, authority, etc. along
the lines of "SirMardon" or "DukeLionheart" or "PresidentClinton" or
"FatherMichael".  I don't interpret "Bobd'Bashasher" as a title, per se,
but rather a sentence using "the" in a corrupted form. I suppose a VI
official would be required to sort that one out, though.
