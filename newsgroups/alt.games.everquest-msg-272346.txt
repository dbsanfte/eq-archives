Hate to say it 42 (if that quoting is in fact correct), but if that's how
you feel, I hope you are indeed staying far away from EQ2.  Sure, there's
variability in how you play the different subclasses, but I don't believe
there is any class with a corner on any market anymore. Well, maybe
enchanters...seems folks are always calling for them specifically, which
seems a little messed up to be, because I thought all mages were supposed
to be good at c/c, but whatever. :P

Point is, no, the classes share their roles now.  Done deal. Different but
equal.  Some will like it. Some will not. If you don't like it, best to
walk away.
