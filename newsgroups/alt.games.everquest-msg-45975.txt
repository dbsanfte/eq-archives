	The most nerfed class, keeping in mind that "nerfed" means "reduced in
power", is easily the Necromancer.  Today's Necromancer is a pale shadow of
what the class was two years ago.

	Of course, Necromancers are the most nerfed class because Necromancers had
the most to nerf.  The class was way over the top originally and even after
multiple "adjustments" is still incredibly powerful.  The class' only real
drawback is that it is pretty much useless in raids against the top 1% or so
of the game's mobs.
