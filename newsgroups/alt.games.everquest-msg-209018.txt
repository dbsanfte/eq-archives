Well, yeah. That seems to be the POINT of an expansion, to get people to
buy it. And including a big change that everyone will want even if they
don't want the other expansion content seems like a pretty sound
business choice to me.

Now, this next part isn't directed at you, just a general comment. :)

Why do people seem to think that the people running MMORPGs are somehow
evil or wrong to be trying to make a profit? I saw this come up in UO
groups a lot, too. Every time one of these companies comes up with a new
service or feature that people have to pay for, it seems there are a lot
of people who get mad. "All they care about is making money!" people
cry, in a hurt tone.

But, yes. All they care about is making money. They are a business, not
a charity. And on top of that, their fundamental costs, in terms of
development, server maintanance, bandwidth and colocation, and so on,
are pretty steep. Sure, the price per megabit has come down pretty
nicely on the consumer level, but business class connections are still
damned pricey, and when you start talking about the kind of immense
bandwidth someone like SOE needs, you are talking about a damned big
phone bill every month.

Anyway, just my 2 coppers.
