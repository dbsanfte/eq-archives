I decided to move a character from Qeynos to Freeport. I looked on
the map and found the plane of knowledge connection.

I click on the book, and after transport, walk down the walkway to
the dome-thing for Freeport. ( And found out my lag is terriffic...,
but then I do have a minimal system. Only thing fast about it is the
cdrom drive and my cable modem connection.)

Click on the transport dome-thing, and get my character transported.

Walk down the tunnel, and find a pit of water, with several 'drowned
corpse' figures swimming at the bottom.

The narrowness of the path doesn't seem like the character can make
it.

So is the jump possible or does my warrior need a method of flying
across the gap ?

Yes, I know about /corpse. I'm looking for a method of walking or
flying across the gap.

Thanks,
JimP.
