You are not a scientist, are you?

This is exactly how all scientific theory works. Your theory needs to
predict the outcome of an experiment. If it does, it stays valid. If
it doesn't, you look for another. If it does most but not all times,
like evolution, then you evolve the theory to account for what was not
predicted. That does not mean the theory itself has conflicts, that
means things are going exactly how they went in every other scientific
theory. No one gets a new theory 100% complete and correct on the very
first experiment or observation.

A good example is Newtonian physics. It does a good job of predict the
results of experiments... up to a point. When you get to relativistic
or quantum stuff, though, it suddenly can't handle it anymore. But
that doesn't mean you can throw out everything Newton came up with.
You just evolve the theory to special relativity and quantum
mechanics.

Evolution does a very good job at explaining what it is trying to
explain. It does not yet have every answer. That does not mean there
is any "conflict" which throws the rest of its conclusions into doubt.
To do that, you need more than a "nothing", more than a "we don't know
yet". You need a "evolution predicted A could not happen but A
happened". Your 'conflicts' don't meet this standard.
