Far from it. Bearing in mind that Australia was once a British 
prison colony (sorry about that, by the way) don't you think that
her citizens (both indigenous and imigrant) have come an awfully 
long way *without* resorting to US style FIGHT! KILL! LAND OF THE BRAVE!
bollocks? 

Same story in the UK. We've never had a revolution, yet we have managed
to reshape out society from a 'classic' Monarchy to a socialist
democracy (with a symbolic Monarch) without fighting about it. I for one
would like to see our Royal family and aristocracy removed, but I'm not
gonna start being obnoxious to get it.

Exactly. You talk about being from "the land of the free" but it is all
an illusion - indeed, the USA has more legislation than most nations.
Consider the 'PATRIOT' anti-terrorism act last year - still think you're
free now? 

The rest of the world, meanwhile, has been moving towards emancipation
for years, all the while putting as much emphasis on responsibility as
freedom. The USA, however, is more concerned with restricting rights to
those it doesn't believe warrants them - namely Afghans (particularly
Taliban members). Isn't that, as your nation so frequenty says,
"Un-American"?
