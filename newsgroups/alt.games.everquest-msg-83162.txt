Get close to the real world. Unwanted babies are unwanted. They likely
won't be nurtured with any diligence. You're so intent on arguing that
you ignore the major points and concentrate on the little issues or blow
smoke around them.

Back to the unwanted children. They will not have healthy, constructive
childhoods if they aren't wanted to begin with. The scale of treatment
will range from wonderful loving care to murder with all the stops in
between. Unwanted means the greater likelihood that they'll be sliding
to the wrong end.

No one is forcing women to kill children. Just as no one forces the men
in the world to do the same. But it will happen much more in the setting
of seeing the children as burdens and drains on resources.

Exactly so. This is why it's been referred to as a potential human
being. It is not viable. It is a parasite at this stage of development.
They are qualitatively different than they will be when they've taken
their first unassisted breath.

Think of a caterpillar and a moth. Are they the same? Answer
carefully...

This is what I mean about avoiding the central issues. OF FREAKIN
COURSE, not every woman is raped. But what about the ones that are? What
about the ones that are pregnant because their contraceptives failed and
it endangers their health or their life? What about the ones that might
be retarded and unable to care for the baby?

Is there never a circumstance when an abortion is reasonable? Would you
care for the child if your mother, wife or daughter were raped and was
impregnated?
