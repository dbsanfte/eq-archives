    It's not so bad. A lot of clerics, when they first start getting AA's,
try the "one point in each" thing to see which one works best. A lot of the
AA's out there are regressive (get less advantage per AA after the first
level), so spending on the first level only is efficient as long as you
wanted that AA anyways.

    Nope, he did that all on his own! ;-) He capped SCM because it's a
recruitment requirement, he worked up RC when we were doing Xegony, he
started in on ND after hearing me preach about it. He's left the guild now,
though. He's unemployed and living in the UK, so trying to find a job and
raid with us was just not working.
