It gets more fun the higher you go IMO.  The higher you go, the bigger
things you can kill, the better loot you can get.

A lot of neat zones are, unfortunately, 50 or 55+, sure, some of them you
can explore under certain circumstances (The Hole comes to mind here), but
the real fun is slaughtering their inhabitants, and some zones you can't
safely explore, but they look really good (Vex Thal, Ssraeshza Temple,
Akheva Ruins, Grieg's End, Dragon Necropolis, Siren's Grotto, Howling Stones
and Chardok come to mind, beautiful zones, although I can see how Ssra gets
old fast with the key camps).  I personally wish Vex Thal was more
accessible, IMO it's probably the most beautifully designed zone in the
game, even if a tad dark, but it IS the citadel of shadow, so it would make
sense to be shadowy.

Besides, it's not every day that you can take part in the death of a Dragon.
