To me the main attraction of the roleplay server is far fewer twinks (very little
twinkage at all yet). People are roleplaying a little more, but with 100+ halflings
who all look alike (well, female/male) running around Misty Thicket it's been hard. 
My major complaint is that it is so hard to learn languages. I put 5+ precious 
training points into Human and humans are still incomprehensible. And skill 
increases, well I haven't seen a language skill increase yet. Grouping with 
someone you can't communicate with is not much fun. Went to Freeport, tried 
to get bound to Freeport and nobody could understand me. Had to head back 
to Rivervale. Am a 6 warrior in nearly full patchwork, upgraded newbie weapon
to a rusty short sword. There was a *lot* of competition for black wolves, and
my patchwork armor is uber in Misty Thicket.
