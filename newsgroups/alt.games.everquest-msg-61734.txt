I totally agree, and is why I always use the word "Attempt" when I say they 
should use complete sentences, etc.  I can easily tell the poor typists 
from the idiots.  I type like shit, myself, but I attempt to sound like I 
have some sort of education.

I either agree or disagree on the "good chunk" - not sure how much that is 
in percentages.  I do agree with the "important part" you mention.

Yes, maturity level is what I am getting at.  Not intelligence, though.  
Someone can be not-so-intelligent and still be courteous and mindful of 
other players.

Unfortunately, I would put hard money on the fact that 90% of the "idiots" 
that I come across in the game are under 30.  Probably a higher percentage.  
There are many younger people in the game that are intelligent, mature, and 
courteous.  But, they are the minority, in my book.  I have an in-game 
person I associate with that is 14 years old who could pass himself off as 
35+ to most people if he wanted to.  There are extremes, for sure.

Obviously, the server could never happen because of discrimination, but if 
it were to exist, you'd have to set some criteria for "admission".  Much 
like our Guild.  It's an "over-30 Guild" ( The Ancient Adventurers ), but 
we let in younger players if they are mature and don't act like idiots, 
because as you pointed out, -maturity- is what counts, not age.  On this 
dream server, there would have to be a way to let mature people in that 
aren't over 30, just like there would be a way to boot the idiots that get 
on there.

Amen to that, Brother Ray.

It's a nice dream, though.  A server without idiots.  Ahhh.... Heaven.
