Sanctuary, level 9
Sentinel effect.

Incredibly lame spell, can't believe someone thought it would be a good
plan to add this to the cleric lineup.  Only known use, to annoy people
in the hopes that they will abandon a camp so you can take it from
them.  Also known as "how to lose friends and alienate people" spell
line.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Celestial Remedy, Level 19
HOT effect

As I've seen it described, this is a very inefficient heal spell,
costing more mana for less healing than GHeal.

Its possible though that it will still retain the special uses of
Celestial Healing; cast before damage begins on the puller or MA, say,
you get no aggro (mob not engaged when cast) and you get the healing
done while things are being brought under control, its sort of like a
Rune with no component cost.  Also, celestial healing is used to slow
damage incoming while a CHeal is on the way, tics of heal remaining
after the CHeal hits continue to ameliorate damage that is coming in.
Is the mana ratio on this so terrible that the spell won't be used even
for these special circumstances?  On thing
is certain, no-one over 44 should consider using this for much of
anything, unless perhaps it turns out to be a decent PL tool.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sermon of the Righteous, level 29
Undead DOT

240 damage for 100 mana over 2 minutes time.  Compare to level 24
Dismiss Undead, 162 damage for 90 mana, hey, what do you know, this is
actually better ratio!  Too bad I can't think of any undead that would
take 2 minutes to kill at anywhere near that level... still, at least
its not the terrible joke that Turning of the Unnatural is.   Hmm,
compare to Wrath, 218 damage for 145 mana, yep, still technically
better.  Looking forward to Expel Undead, heck, damage to mana ratio
there is only 2.1, this spell actually has it beat at 2.4.  I'm afraid
I'm not a root and rot player, but at least this spell would make some
sense if thats the operating plan, get a necro and druid in group and
stack DOTs on, then sit down and play Gems while you wait for the exp to
drop into your laps.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sacred Word, level 39
AOE stun with damage

Wow, an AOE stun at level under the late 50s!  I'm excited here, finally
a spell I might use at 54+.  But its a damage producer, which makes it
special situation only, I'll have to think hard to find a circumstance
for it.  Since it will break mez, I won't want to use it while grouped
with enchanters, bards, or necromancers.  Also, as with other damage
stuns, it will probably have twice the chance of being resisted.

Hmm, on the other hand, it will probably come in handy as my only
targetable AOE nuke, for farming greenies.  Lol, I know, I'll Sacred
Word, then Unswerving Hammer of Faith!

Looking more closely, cast time 3 seconds, recast time instant... if
that is accurate, I'd be able to lay down a continuous barrage of stun,
while the real nukers chain cast AOE to slaughter a whole cluster in
place.  I bet its not accurate, though.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Armor of the Faithful, level 49
Self only HP and AC buff

This overwrites Armor of Protection, with more HP and more AC.  Duration
is also even longer.  You can bet I'll be keeping this one up 24/7 just
as I have AoP.  Down sides same as AoP; conflicts with Talisman,
conflicts with Yaulp line.  Since I've happily kept the lesser AoP up
despite this, here's a real upgrade spell, the first one of the
purchaseable lot I'll really be using for sure.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

these are drop spells, and I haven't gotten any of them yet, just
looking at the specs castersrealm has up
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ephitaph of Life, level 52
magic based DOT

at 750 damage for 275 mana damage to mana ratio 2.727272... compare to
Retribution dtm of 2.1625, or Banish Undead at 2.6, it beats out the
lower level DDs.  Hmm, Reckoning at dtm of 2.68 comes awful close and
doesn't take time... but at only 30 seconds duration, and not breaking
Root, this might really be a usable spell.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mark of Retribution, level 54
Might be a reverse damage shield, rumors abound

Eqcastersrealm thinks this is a lesser mark of Karn, which is to say
each time you hit its victim you get a small heal.  Reports on EQclerics
say that it stacks with mark of karn... which would be incredible.
Either this is an error, a bug, or it does something else entirely.

One rumor is that instead of healing the person doing the hitting, the
mark instead adds some damage to that done with each blow.  This would
also be incredible.  This spell deserves immediate testing, either way!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remove greater curse, level 54
bad buff remover (ala cure disease, cure blindess, et al)

Er, whats a curse?  Are those those annoying negative effects that don't
seem to be susceptible to cure disease, poison, cancel magic, or cure
blindness?  If this is a slow remover, sign me up!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judgement, level 56
DD

Slow to cast (7.5 seconds) poor dtm ratio (2.3) and expensive (325 mana)
I can't see using this over Reckoning with its much better dtm (2.68)
even though the 750 damage is the highest raw damage nuke we get at this
level... when is 750 really going to do a job that 670 won't?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blessed Armor of the Risen
AoP upgrade, with mana regen added in

Unbelievable!  Reports say mana regen -does- stack with Clarity 2.
Single best cleric spell of the expansion if it works as advertised and
doesn't get nerfed.  Too bad its level 58, thats an awful long way from
54, especially if I get into the alternate skills.
Still, like AoP in the past, and AotF now, this will be an "always on"
spell from 58 up,
and heck, at 2 hours 24 minutes, that will be even easier than keeping
the first two up!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blessing of Aegolism
group Aegolism

As listed, this spell is quite lame, giving a much shorter duration
version of Aegolism to the group.  The "savings" of 2 peridot assuming
you have 6 in your group isn't much at 60th level.  One good thing about
it, if you are getting ready for a short term encounter (say Ixiblat or
Faydedar type affairs) it does cost a lot less mana than casting the
real thing on a full group.

Also, with the advent of /targetgroupbuff, I note that Heroic Bond
actually affects 7 people when cast on another group... the 6 members of
that group plus the caster.  In a raid force, it would be possible to
use this by assembling the desired Aegolism targets in a group (puller,
MA, SA, Chanters, Shaman... people who might reasonably get aggro) and
hit them all plus the cleric in a single shot.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marzin's Mark, level 60
group symbol of marzin

Relatively inexpensive to cast, hits a whole group with Marzin, uses
only a single peridot... ok, so the cash savings shouldn't matter by 60,
but this looks like a usable spell.  With /targetgroupbuff on, and mana
pumps running on full, a 60 cleric should be able to rapidly symbol an
entire raid force, much handier than me pumping them out one at a time
at 54.  Still, its nothing new and fantastic, unlikeBaotR
