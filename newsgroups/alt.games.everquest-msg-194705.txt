That sort of thing hasn't gone down too well either.  The min-maxers
and their bazillions of mindless imitators have a firmly established
tradition of translating "favored" (or "favoured", if you prefer) as
"required", no matter how small the advantage is.  This looks to me
to be the root of the high-end Druids' complaints all along:  only
those who are believed to be the "best" at some presumed requirement
are welcome.  Most every class except Warrior, Cleric, and Enchanter
has experienced this in the past, and now the Warriors are complaining
about sufferring from it in PoP xp groups.  Doesn't much matter what
SOE does, some people will use it as an excuse for the particular
stupidity and/or rudeness they are engaged in, and others will whine
about it whether they have a legitimate complaint or not.
