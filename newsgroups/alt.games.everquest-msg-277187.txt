I don't know that I'd expect you to "know", but...

You are on usenet, you've been around a long time, you've struck me as a 
person who has the wherewithal and ability to try and figure things out 
for yourself... and I'd have thought the normal resources would be well 
known to you.

In this case a good first stop for issues with spells is lucy...

Indicates the target type is "PB AE"

Which may or may not mean something to you, but it would be a clue at 
least that it wasn't like say... Thunder Strike which is listed as 
target type: Single. Lightning Storm is listed as "Targeted AE".

Combine that with the fact that the spell gem was purple and not red or 
green...

At any rate, at most I'd have expected you to ask here what it means for 
a spell to be PB AE, instead of petitioning about whether the spell was 
broken.

Didn't mean to offend.

Like palindrome, I was simply surprised that you didn't know.
