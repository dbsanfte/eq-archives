According to http://www.simon.forsyth.net/everquest.html :

"There are two statistics to look at on a weapon, damage and delay. A
weapon that has more damage is not necessarily a better weapon. The
ratio between these two stats is often mentioned but the damage per
second is an easier to understand representation of the ratio
(although harder to calculate). 

damage per second = 10 * (damage x 2 + 1) / delay"

So basically, the higher dps = better the weapon.
