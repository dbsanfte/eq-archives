I am having a similar if not the same problem.  I click on Play and get a 
windows error --EQGAME has encountered an error and must close.  I have 
deleted eqgame.exe and repatched to no avail.  I thought maybe I was having 
a problem with my old computer so I tried test eq and that worked just fine.
