I'm thinking they see her and want her to login her druid for a port.

My guild addressed the 'unreasonable requests' issue pretty early, the
rules clearly state that continually asking guildmembers to port,
powerlvl and give you stuff is a Bad Thing. (Of course, the porting
issue is somewhat alleviated by our plethora of druids :) ) 
Our only 50+ is a druid, and he only powerlevels on rare occasions and
only as favors to friends, not for guild purposes. For as long as I
have been in the guild, *nobody* has ever asked him to log out his
bard and have his druid do some gruntwork.

By the way... with tuna overwriting shielding, does anyone know which
buffs druid skin will overwrite/be overwritten by? (I'm not sure which
buffs get interfered with so I usually only cast that on request or if
no other buffer is present)
