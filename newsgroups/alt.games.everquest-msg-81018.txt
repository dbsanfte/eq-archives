If you happen to have Painshop Pro, the screencap feature on that works
quite well.  It just runs in the background and imports the screen when you
hit a key combination.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
