    That's likely an artifact of the "choose your own hair" process. If the
hair types weren't yet implemented for a given race, they'd show up as bald.
At least I assume the ogres weren't meant to look like Mr. Clean. It'll be
fun to see if "bald" will be one of the hair choices available - expect to
hear a lot of gnomes telling Number One, their puller, to "make it so" if
that happens.
