In Full screen mode your information is in windows that you can move,
minimize and bring back the boxes at will during the game. As default all
windows can be changed during game.

Alt + C is chat window
Alt + M is your command menu window
Alt + S is Spell castingd window
Alt + T is the 'target' window
Alt + H the 'hotkey' customizeable window
Alt + B is the window with spell effects on you
Alt + Y is your info windows (Box with red/blue/yellow bars)
Alt + L locks the windows in place (Can't click top left and move boxs) And
alt + L again unlocks it

Last but not least.  you can customize (As with ALL keyboard commands).  On
the not 'full screen mode' mode *Grin* click options then keyboard and then
klick 'next' button about 6 or 7 times... very last two pages are for
windows in full screen and how to hide/unhide them (and luck/unlock)

hope this helps
