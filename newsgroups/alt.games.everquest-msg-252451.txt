Depends.  Near me, there's good money in recycling.  Having someone take 
all the cans out of your aluminum dumpster would definitely be theft.

Anyway, trust me.  I looked it up.  It was definitely theft to remove 
items from a privately-owned dumpster in Berkeley in 1987.  It may be 
different in other places.

Of course, the odds of someone actually bothering to press charges is 
very, very low.  But I asked my old dorm's permission before furnishing my 
new apartment with their discards anyway.  And -still- managed to get 
hassled by campus cops over it, but they did piss off after I made it 
clear I had permission to take the stuff.
