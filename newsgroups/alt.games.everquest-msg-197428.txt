The body must rot before the event can be restarted.   If it has not rotted
yet, the Tribunal will return the response "That trial is currently in use"
and will not port a new group in to begin it.

It was not always this way.  In the early days you could go in right after a
successful group.  However, since the corpse was still on the ground, with
any marks (no drop, lore, and all you need to "prove" that you have
completed the trial) left over, players who had not completed the event
could loot one of the left over marks from the prior group.   Sony caught
onto that relatively quickly and changed how it worked.
