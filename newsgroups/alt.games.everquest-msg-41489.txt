Well, when that Ry-Gorr Elite is dead in 45 seconds, does
it _really_ matter?  When somebody is snaring for quad-kiting
and doesn't want to reapply that Snare every 1.5 minutes,
yeah...it's silly.

Snare and Ensnare always (to me) seemed like the same
spell:

1) Snare is for that grouping druid doing single/double
constant blue  pulls.

2) Ensnare is for that guy quad kiting cougars or for that
outside no-enchanter group that is having trouble with the
yellow overpull and needs somebody to kite it until the
cleric can get some mana back...
