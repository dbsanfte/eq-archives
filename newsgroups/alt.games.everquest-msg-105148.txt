Could you point out *exactly* where I said it *IS* hacked. I recall
putting a question mark after the words "EQ hacked" which any educated
person would see is a *QUESTION and not a **STATEMENT.

*question
\Ques"tion\, n. [F., fr. L. quaestio, fr. quaerere, quaesitum, to seek
for, ask, inquire. See Quest, n.] 1. The act of asking; interrogation;
inquiry; as, to examine by question and answer. 

**statement

\State"ment\, n. 1: a message that is stated or declared; a
communication (oral or written) setting forth particulars or facts 
etc;
