Not long after I started playing, I remember someone posting a link to a
mesage board that had a humorous EQ write-up on it.  It was a group of
players going to Veeshan or something.  All I remember is things like this:

A_warrior says: I don't see it.
Silverwing slashes you for 800 damage!
Silverwing slashes you for 800 damage!
Silverwing slashes you for 800 damage!
Silverwing slashes you for 800 damage!

and a Druid that always yelled "Phat Lewt!" when he zoned.

I dunno, something like that.  If anyone knows the URL to this, I'd
appreciate it.  It may have even been part of a series, too.
