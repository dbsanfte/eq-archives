Monks cannot shoot arrows.  Bards cannot shoot arrows (although you
can make an excellent case that bards are not melee's)

Archery damage with a good bow and arrows and quiver is appreciable,
its more than possible to kill things without ever having to get hit.  Problem
is, its expensive, since arrows cost money, even if you make them
yourself.  You'll rarely see enough money back from a mob to pay for
the arrows it took to kill one.

Monks are not fragile, unless you are looking at damage off spells.  Rogues
and Rangers are the "fragile but lethal" classes, with Rangers far higher on
the "fragile" end of that scale.
