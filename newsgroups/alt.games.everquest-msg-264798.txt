As you say, different strokes.  I love having the sound on exactly
because it IS the same sound for the same thing, and I can learn to
notice those sounds when I'm otherwise distracted.  So if I've
forgotten to switch spell sets and start to cast a buff instead of
a nuke, the sound often warns me that it's the wrong type of spell.

Indeed, I recently came close to dying because I *had* turned the
sound down.  I was doing a bunch of faction quest turn-ins in Qeynos
and turned down the sound so the repeated trumpets wouldn't wake my
daughter. :-)  I thought I was safe because all the nearby NPCs were
at least dubious to me, but it turned out there was a scowling one
lurking nearby, and he came up behind me while my attention was on
the quest NPC.  Fortunately I had the sound turned down, but not off,
because it was the "me taking damage" sound that tipped me off in
time to feign death.

On the other hand, I admit I've long since tired of listening to my
druid barking when I fight in wolf form....
