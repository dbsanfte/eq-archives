Like I said before, some nitwit happens to make a sale when he's
auctioning over /ooc or /shout, and he figures it's helping his odds
of making a sale by doing so. Clueless twit doesn't realize the guy

used /auction, anyway, and he wouldn't have landed on people's ignore
lists for being a pinhead.
