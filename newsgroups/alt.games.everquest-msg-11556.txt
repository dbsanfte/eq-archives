Probably the easiest without getting too lost is dwarf (though Kaladim is a
difficult starting city).  Halfling isn't too bad either (and has a better
newbie zone than dwarf).

Well, ok, the easiest newbie zones that aren't usually at all crowded are
probably Freeport and Qeynos, but then you're stuck playing a blind human.

My favorites are gnome and wood elf, but neither are really great for folks
totally new to the game.
