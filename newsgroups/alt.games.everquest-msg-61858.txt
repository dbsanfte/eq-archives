I suggest not worrying about the prices goods will bring after SoL comes
out.

What I do suggest is that anyone who can join up with a good exploration
party for the day SoL goes live, do just that.  Get in there, get whatever
adventure you can and whatever loot you can ASAP.

The most fun this game has to offer is about to be laid bare before you, go
get it.  Don't worry about anything else.
