It take a LOT of luck to get any FLs, since its around 1 of 40 giants that
drop one.
My druid started soloing giants in FM, juts at DL zone at level 28. Got 1
forest loop so far, am level 33 now.
You could join a Giant Fort group in FM, probably the best idea for a cleric.
You kill a lot of giants that way, but have to roll for the loot.
