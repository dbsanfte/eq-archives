Back in '91, my boss ( head of the CompSci department at a major UNI ) 
sends out an e-mail about password security and tells everyone to make sure 
their passwords are very obscure, blah blah blah...

I'm bored, so I download a password cracker and compile it, then rename the 
executable to something not so, um, obviously -wrong- to be running on a 
production UNIX system.

It returns 2 peoples' passwords - my boss' and his secretary's.  Go figure.  
His was his wife's name with a bang after it ( leann! ) and hers was HER 
name with a 1 after it ( tracy1 ).  Since I liked my job and he was a 
prick, I didn't mention it to him.  I did tell the secretary that I 
"overheard someone in the labs saying they knew her password" so she would 
change it.

I really should have hosed him.
