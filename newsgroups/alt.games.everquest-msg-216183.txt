I've been on hiatus from EQ for a bit and am now just getting back in to it.
I'm also starting to get a little ancy for EQ2. For me one of the things I'm
looking forward to will be the new environments .I want to see what havoc
the destruction of Luclin has reeked on Antonica.
The houses and apartments will be great but I think the aging of arms and
armor will make being a blacksmith or a tailor a profitable trade skill to
have (if you can still be a blacksmith without being a tradesman,I don't
know how that's gunna work).
What do you all think?

(Haven't been keeping up on a.g.e for a while so if this has been talked to
death sorry.)
