No, there is "official" testing too, usually for new content. Right
now we're testing a revamped zone which will probably go live next
week. But the fact of the matter is most bugs are caught during
regular play, not official testing. These are unintentional side
effect bugs that the devs don't see coming (as opposed to balance or
optimization bugs the devs are expecting when they make a change or
add something new). Many of them have no obvious connection to what
caused them in the first place (bard bugs are notorious for this).
Some of them come out of nowhere with no cause at all.

Your so-called "structured testing environment" would in actuality be
an empty server with a few copied characters coming over every blue
moon when Sony begs for people to do something. To fix the bugs that
crop up in normal play (99% of them), you need to be informed by
people playing normally. Copied characters would not be playing
normally.

As they should.

That's when all the other servers become "test" servers far more
severely than they are already. I hope for everyone here's sake Sony
continues to listen to 'me' and not to 'you'. :-p

You aren't the first person to suggest copied characters to test. But
Sony has seen what testers are like on the beta servers for the last
couple expansions. A lot of screwing around, very little testing, and
that was *with* the new content carrot and a heavy dev presence.
