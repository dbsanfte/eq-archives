First thing I would invest in would be some Platinum or Velium Fire Opal
rings. AC and extra hps are nothing to sneeze at. Then save up for a haste item.
I got a haste item late in my career and it can not be underestimated.
the Flowing Black Silk Sash is down to 2-3k on many servers. Then start
on getting some reinforced acrylia or any grey flesh items.

The Spider fur Cloak, Belt and Collar are getting cheap on many servers as well.
Nice and light as well.

Yes, do not neglect 1HB or 2HB. There are some nice weapons for those.
Get a Fighting Baton for 1HB. Get a bamboo bo stick to practice 2HB with.
Also, the 1hb skill caps higher than h2h up until like level 56.
