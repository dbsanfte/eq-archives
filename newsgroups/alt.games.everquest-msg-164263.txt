 I think what didn't work about the Monk nerf is they didn't get
everyone with the nerf bat. Some of the upper tier Monks didn't really
notice a change while the remaining 90% lost their ability to solo or to
be very useful to a group with no tank. So Verant is just figuring out
how to nerf the remaining 10%.
