I would suggest that you check out http://chinet.com/everquest/norrath.pdf 
as the average age of all respondants there is 24.3 years, which seems to 
indicate that the average EQ player is NOT a teenager.  Based on my own 
experiences, I find this to be pretty close to what I expected.

All I was commenting on was you statement that his arguement was 
worthless.  It's his arguement, it's his money, by definition it can't be 
worthless.  It most certainly can be weak.  Your arguement about how 
people spend their money is most likely worthless, since as far as I know 
you have no control over how most people spend their money. 
	
As to the costs of the gaming machine, I once again made the fatal error 
of assuming you had some spark of intelligence.  You were bitching about 
$5k/year, I was trying to convey the message that even those who spent a 
LOT of time and money gaming don't have to spend $5k/year.  I think you 
lost yourself with your constant gyrations to try and deny whatever 
contradiction you've been most recently caught in.  (Oh, and that 
no-archive trick only helps when there aren't publically available servers 
which keep all messages for 90 days or so.)
