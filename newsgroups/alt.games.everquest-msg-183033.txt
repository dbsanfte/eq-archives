Okay, Those weapons are not bad. I don't know a whole lot about mellee, but
i do know that if your STA is iver 100 or 101 then it dont mean dickshit in
your stamina bar unless it is absolutely imperitive that you jump. other
than that i suggest upgrading from the Wurmslayer to a Lamenation, you will
lose a small amount of DPS but the faster swinging should help you keep
aggro better.
