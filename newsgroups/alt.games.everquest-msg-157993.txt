I had a surprisingly effective group (low 30s) a couple of weeks
ago with two chanters and my cleric at the FM giant fort. I would
pull, chanter pets would get its attention, and we would all nuke
for all we were worth.  Surprisingly little downtime, and decent
exp and loot. If the giant started beating on the chanters I'd root
it. Plus I'd heal the chanter pets (and chanters!) when needed.

Not much risk of me dying on a pull with both Divines up.

I wasn't expecting it to work minus a melee, but it did. Be
interesting to see if it worked at other levels. There are
some odd class mixes that work well.
