Well, congratulations.  You have now met someone who, though I haven't yet
completed it, will have it complete at some glorious future date...
Actually I might have given up if it weren't for the fact that you said
you've never met anyone who *has* completed it... in which case I consider
that a personal challenge, and I've never yet failed to do anything that
someone told me I can't do.
