I know it's belaboring the point, but...

TwoHead has a history of holding others' illogic (most definitely
including my own) up to the light and pointing out where they've
fallen short.  It is this rather admirable history that made me
so relentless in that ShowEQ thread.  I am a great fan of the
biblical injunction/challenge to "judge not lest you be judged".
I am always prepared to be held to that standard (if nobody will
point out my hypocrisies to me I'm a lot less likely to recognize
and correct them), and I am always ready to hold others to it as
well, especially those like TwoHead who have earned my respect.

I hope that TwoHead continues to post here, rather than withdrawing
again as he/she did after the argument in that thread.  There are
few of us who have contributed as sensibly to the discussions here.
Certainly most of my posts fall well below the standard met by most
of hers/his.
