This is an excellent point.  Verant had staff on hand to "witness" the
"exploit", why did they let it occur?  If they saw the AI was stuck,
they should have taken over control of the mob instead.  It would have
then been a wipe-out for Conquest.  Hell, since they were feeling
pissy about it, they could have camped the corpses as punishment
instead of suspension and bannings.

Anybody that saw some of the earlier GM events KNOW that there are
some GM that would just LOVE the chance to slaughter some players.
