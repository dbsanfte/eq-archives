No one can really answer that question... best you can do is search for some
reviews on EQ
It's all up to your preference... you can try buying the basic version for
10$, then just hook it up with you credit card, I think you get a free
month. Give it a shot if ya want... the expansions have much more detailed
terrain than the original one, though.
