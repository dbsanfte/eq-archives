There is an element of truth to that.  Probably more in some guilds than
others.  It's no big secret (my how times have changed) that the "uber"
guilds have two tiers of people, the brains and the brawn.

But to look at it realistically, you have to realize that this is how it
*must* work.  "Too many cooks" is more than a quaint old saying.  It applies
to guilds as much as it applies to corporations.

Do *you* write the check to pay the lease/mortgage of your place of
business?  If you do, do you let anyone else?  Leaders are a required
element of life.  Anarchy is not a workable system.  =)
