I was a victim of one of those trains in North Ro on Sullon Zek.  I was in
one of the Inns at the time, so I didn't even hear my assailants coming....
just a sudden row of "A sand giant hits YOU for 96 points of damage"  "A
sand giant hits YOU for 96 points of damage"  "LOADING--PLEASE WAIT."

From the in-zone shouts I had heard about these incidents in Oasis, and NRo,
I would say the screenshots are real, and not doctored.

Ironic thing was, I was on the same team as he.  I was also bound in Qeynos
(hard to find a bind for a Good Team member in FP on Sullon).  I lost my
corpse and a full day's worth of loot because of that (all of my really
valuable stuff was in the bank, thankfully).

After I got over my inital anger and cursing him with every breath, I
realized what he was doing was a valid war tactic....sabotaging the ability
of the enemy to grow stronger.  I just got caught in the cross-fire.  My
first PvP death on that server, and it's friendly fire.  :-)  Go figure.

Too bad about the new rule about those under lvl 6 being able to be pk'd in
mid-to-high level adventure/travel zones now.  The only team this really
benefits is the Evil Team (again), as they get protected access between
places like Neriak and Freeport.  The Neutral team is mostly unaffected by
it, as they hold everything between Erudin and Rivervale, with only Kithicor
and West Commons for their lowbies to worry about being PK'd in if they're
on a long distance run.  The Good team is hyper-penalized (again), as their
cities (Halas and Felewith) are at opposite ends of the world, and their
lowbies need to run through more than half a dozen hostile zones where they
can be PK'd in before they reach any measure of safety.  This completes the
total isolation of the two outposts of the Good team from each other.

Maybe they need to create a special teleport spire on Sullon to link
Everfrost and Greater FayDark to make up for this extra penalty against the
Goods, because it appears that most of their other decisions about Sullon
seem to kick the Good team in the shins at every turn.
