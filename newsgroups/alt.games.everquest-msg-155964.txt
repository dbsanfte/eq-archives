Er. Whoops.

"Shock line has a minor knockback component
which is probably why it's all or nothing, as most nukes with stuns or
kb are all/nothing. "

Should read:

"Shock line has a minor knockback component
which is why it's probably all or nothing, as most nukes with stuns or
kb are all/nothing. "

But thanks for the clarification.  I was mostly just going by the fact that
a few of my nukes have stun/kb components and they're the only ones that are
all or nothing.
