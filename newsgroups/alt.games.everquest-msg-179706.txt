The key word is enraged, i.e. when the mob did his auto-riposte
"discipline" (some mobs enrage at 10% health).  A riposte doesn't
generate an attack against a target that is not in the front arc,
so folks who were behind the AoW didn't expect to have to turn
off their auto-attack while he was enraged.  Those of them who
were afk or otherwise not paying attention took an attack from
the AoW for every swing they attempted after Meem's "friend"
turned him, think about those high levels averaging probably
more than 2 swings per second and the AoW's huge damage per hit.
