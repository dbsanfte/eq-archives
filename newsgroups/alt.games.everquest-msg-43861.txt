The new boots are no drop.

Has anyone compared them to Jboots? 

They are the same speed but t-boots have a casting time, which Jboots
don't


And I guess the biggest question is How Much and where to buy them.  I
think its Solb but how to find the vendor?

Not sure of exact price, but your iksar will not be able to purchase
from the gnome merchant in Sol A without you first killing tons of
Kobolds in Sol B.  It is the same merchant who sells the 100% weight
reduction pack.
