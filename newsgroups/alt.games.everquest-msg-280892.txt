I am trying to remember from when I created a character a month ago. In the 
character creation area, there is nothing to indicate it. There is nothing 
in the tutorial to indicate so either.

I skimmed the manual, so I can't ber certain if it is mentioned that they 
have different starting areas. It is mentioned (I think) that they have 
different home cities, but I don't remember anything about the starting 
area.
