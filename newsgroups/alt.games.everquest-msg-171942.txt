=20
Santa Clara County's first baby of 2003 was welcomed Wednesday with the =
routine offerings of flowers, food and baby booties. But next week, =
Seyram Kwaku Semakor will be introduced to some West African customs, =
too, as his elated parents, family and friends celebrate his birth with =
an ``outdooring ceremony,'' a traditional Ghanaian ritual held on the =
eighth day of an infant's life.

Seyram doesn't know it yet, but at the event he'll taste water and a =
touch of alcohol to teach him an important first lesson in life: =
``Sometimes bad and good can look very similar,'' his father Selasi =
Semakor said.

Selasi and Charity Semakor, he a network administrator for IBM and she a =
nurses' aide, who live in San Jose, couldn't imagine introducing their =
first-born child to the world any other way. Both parents were raised in =
the Republic of Ghana, and they look forward to the pouring of libations =
Wednesday, when Seyram's birth will also be announced to the spirits of =
his ancestors. The ancestors will then be called upon to provide him =
with spiritual guidance and protection for the rest of his days.

It's an auspicious start for a baby who certainly took his time getting =
here -- but still managed to beat Santa Clara County's second baby of =
the year by more than an hour.

Seyram finally decided to make his grand entrance 26 minutes after 12 -- =
nearly two weeks after his due date -- at Kaiser-Santa Clara hospital. =
Seyram, which means ``blessed one'' in Ewe, the language spoken in his =
father's native region of Ghana, was on his own schedule in the delivery =
room, too. He put his parents through nearly 14 hours of labor before he =
entered the world with a wonderful wail.

``He was so slow coming out,'' moaned his very tired mother. ``But after =
taking so long,'' she said, while gazing into his tiny, chocolate eyes, =
``you are a very lucky baby.''

Throughout the Santa Clara Valley, slow was, without a doubt, the word =
of the day on Wednesday. Hospitals used to delivering several babies =
within the first few minutes of most new years couldn't believe the =
dearth of deliveries in the South Bay this time around.

Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford, which delivers 5,400 =
babies a year -- more than one every two hours -- didn't see its first =
New Year's baby until 6:42 a.m., said spokesman Matt Lash. By midday, =
Los Gatos Community Hospital still didn't even have a mom-to-be in =
labor.

Yeah, that sounds like society isn't about to collapse, lol.=20

``It is strange,'' said Amanda Urquhart, a spokeswoman for O'Connor =
Hospital in San Jose, which didn't deliver a newborn until 4:53 a.m. =
``The last couple of years, the babies came a lot quicker.''

No one has to tell Seyram's parents that their 7-pound, 9-ounce son is =
extremely special. After all, he let out nary a cry during his first 12 =
hours of life, save during his birth and circumcision.

Kid probably has autism.

``He's really calm,'' said his 31-year-old mother.

``He gets that from me,'' said his 40-year-old father, laughing.

The San Jose couple already has high hopes and expectations for their =
son, who like nearly half of California's young children has a =
foreign-born parent.

``He definitely has to be very humble and also have some strong =
education,'' said his father. ``We want to instill in him the fear of =
God and just love for everybody.''

Wednesday was also an exciting day in the life of other Bay Area =
families. A 5-pound-six-ounce Santa Rosa boy became the Bay Area's first =
official New Year's baby. He was delivered by caesarean section at the =
stroke of midnight.

But workers at many South Bay hospitals said this year seemed like a =
baby bust compared with the New Year's baby boom that surrounded the =
millennium. And there doesn't seem to be as much hoopla associated with =
the births as there once was, either.

In past years, the lucky first baby was often treated by merchants and =
hospitals to a host of gifts, ranging from a free crib to a year's =
supply of diapers, but that tradition is slowly fading.

Three years ago, the first baby born at El Camino Hospital in Mountain =
View was given a stock portfolio containing shares of local companies =
SGI and Yahoo. Good Samaritan Hospital in San Jose offered a $2,000 =
college scholarship for its first baby of 2000.

But in these tough economic times, most Santa Clara County hospitals =
said they had no plans to reward their first babies of the year with =
anything so special. Seyram's family received a floral display from =
Kaiser Permanente.

``It used to be everybody was so excited. But times have changed,'' said =
Sharon Brown, an administrative supervisor at Regional Medical Center =
San Jose.

Of course, parents whose babies are born just a few minutes earlier, =
before the midnight deadline on Dec. 31, at least get something -- a tax =
write-off from Uncle Sam for the year.

``After 12, you don't have anything for the next year -- except the =
baby,'' Brown said. ``I root for the tax write-off.''

Almost brings a tear to your eye, what a beautiful and romantic =
sentiment.=20
