One can reasonably assume that Sony can set whatever price they want,
because they do not have to work to generate items; they can just
create them voila. Yantis, however, must employ people to farm said
items and cash, which is real-time money. 

Sony has the benefit of not having to do that to a certain extent, and
can seemingly price the stuff to a point where it is no longer
profitable for people like Yantis to employ others to get these
items/plat at a rate that could never even begin to match Sony.
