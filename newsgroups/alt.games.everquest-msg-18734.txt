16 seconds and 9 seconds same on casting time? Go find a mob that quads or
trips in the 100s and engage it for 7 seconds, then you'll see the
difference. But there is a drawback to the evac spells, anyone in the group
that has mana will lose 300 mana for the trip (doesn't always seem to happen
though) and there is a chance of someone being left behind.
