ROFL - same here.  Got new speaker system the other day - sub woofer, etc.  
My kids thought it really was thundering out.  Now I have to turn the 
volume down when I see the weather change.

Last night in OT, we got a 5 minute break from the rain.  When it started 
up again, I sent out an OOC "Oh good, we need the rain".  Someone replies 
with "No we don't"  - Duh!
