He does say "some of the highlights include", and I don't think most
people would consider "backend revamp" a highlight, because it doesn't
affect gameplay directly.  Of course if it ends with everyone losing
all their AA or AAs that worked no longer working, people might
consider it a lowlight...

I expect the actual patch message to be much longer.
