These are for a jaggedpine quest. I think they are called boots of the pine
+11 AC +5 Sta +2 Dex +5 vsMg for stats like that I can hardly see a reason
to do the quest since it requires quite a bit of time to collect the
different pieces and if I remember right there are a few combines you need
to do so you'd need tailoring skill to do the quest and one of the quests
also needs baking skill. You need to kill some things that are light blue to
a lvl 60 about 150 tailoring skill a couple free hours and for all your time
and effort you get druid boots with no wisdom and no mana. I'm not even sure
I'd put boots with these stats on a ranger much less a pure caster.
