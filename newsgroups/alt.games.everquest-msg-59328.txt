WHAT? You didn't get a single flame? Are you sure you posted the
question to alt.games.everquest, and not alt.cuddle or something?
SOUND THE HELPFULNESS ALERT! A NEWBIE ESCAPED WITHOUT BEING 
GREETED BY HOSTILITY!!! ALERT THE MEDIA! STOP THE PRESSES!

Well, judging by your post, you didn't whine, you presented
your problem in a clear, consise manner, and you didn't call
regulars bad names. If all newbie posts were like yours, Bizbee
would be out of a job!
