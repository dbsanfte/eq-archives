I locked up during a "regular" group teleport from Faydark to GD last night at
around 7 PM central time.  My partner went through just fine, (he is the
wizard.)  I, too, had to reboot my computer.  I was still listed as "grouped"
on my partner's screen until I enterred the game - then it dropped off.  Mind
you this was the portal on the west side of GD - not the east side.  

>Did anyone else lock-up during the trip to Velious portal?  Probably just my
>pc but I'm leery about trying that again if it is a bug.
