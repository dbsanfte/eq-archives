Hee hee, Just did that.

I'm still not sure.
Everything he posts is both troll like and idiotic.
So I can't make my mind up if he is just a troll (and quite a clever
one).
Or so completely moronic that he has no idea of his own ineptitude.

Either way all of his posts are worthless.
I guess at least most of them are not offensive.
I do like the way that he never replies to any threads here.

Ho hum Guess I will just kill his threads from now.

Jim
