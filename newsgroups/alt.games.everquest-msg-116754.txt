On my server, the standard protocol seems to be 3 gems to the symboling 
cleric then alpha the rest of the gems.  Seems pretty fair, really.

But my name starts with 'Z'.

Sigh...

And it's amazing how many times I hear 'oh, the group composition has 
changed so much, we better restart the alpha' just as I'm -finally- next 
in line after about 4 hours...
