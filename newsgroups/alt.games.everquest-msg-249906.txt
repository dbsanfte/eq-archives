Plus:  the levels that can MOST benefit from that zone can get much better loot
other places.  So the *true newbies* for sure AREN'T contemplating the trip to
SK, even if they COULD afford a port, they can just go to the Overthere and get

away.....
My necro spent a couple days there... we got one full group together and had
ALL the spires to ourselves.  Eat your hearts out... oldtimers :)))
