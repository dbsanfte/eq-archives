I've been having trouble with my connection lately and get disconnected
sometimes.  I noticed that if I am invisible when I disconnect I will always
come back with invis stripped.  Is this a bug?  Could I be attacked *after*
LD or only if I was aggroed before I went LD?  So far I haven't died from it
so I suspect you don't aggro mobs after LD.
