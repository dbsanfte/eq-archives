Seemed to make sense to me to discuss the original posters
question/situation and not my own.

9/22 1hs procs torment, 35pnt dd 50pnt dot and Blind (this has no other
effect than just piss the mob off, a lot)

Yes, but not by my much. You said " if you're not using a procing weapon,
you're going to have a hell of a time playing no matter what the stats on
your non-procing weapons are" That reads to me that without a proc'ing
weapon any Warrior is going to struggle to get on..."hell of a time"
certainly sounds like it would be difficult.

(Not a spelling flame but I was trying to find the word "exadurating"
because I had no idea what it meant and I was thinking "damn these people
with better vocabularies than me"...then I re read and realised what you
meant)

Only Epic wielding ranger I have grouped with was 60th and I would have no
hope holding aggro from him, however the 59 Warrior (at the time) didn't
have a problem, this was probably as much the Rangers doing as the Warriors.

I don't disagree that proc's are good for holding aggro but to post in a
thread where a 36th level Warrior wants to know what he should use that they
are "God" is misleading. Great, a Warlord said I need procs so I dropped my
Centi LS and Wurmy and have got 2 Yaks now.
Up until you get to a point that someone can stick a serious (100pnt)Dex
buff on you, procs are really hit and miss. At your level I am sure there
are some fantastic proc'ing weapons for holding aggro especially when
someone is casting Avatar on you (in fact I know, I've seen Ben's Magelo
profile) but we are talking about a section of game that not everyone will
reach, or even try to reach whereas the low-mid levels, practically everyone
who plays, gets to.

I'd be interested to hear what Weapons Jazz used in his Warriors *rapid* and
untwinked, ascension to 55(?)
