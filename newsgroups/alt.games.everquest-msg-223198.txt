It's not required that you do adventures or raids...if your responsibilities
don't allow you to commit to a block of time, grouping is certainly still an
option.  I've never been in an xp group (as opposed to an adventure) yet
that's gotten bent out of shape that someone had to go do the RL thing.
Disappointed, certainly, but that's normal.

The game doesn't require you to raid to get quite good gear.  Much of it is
tradeskill-able, and certainly if you don't raid you don't need the best
gear anyway.
