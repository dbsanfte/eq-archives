Once you reach level 20 + you will NEVER use hand to hand as a wizard, not
even to kill green mobs. Eventually you will have a Staff of the Wheel as
your primary weapon and its atack delay is 100 so its very useless. If you
feel the need to use a weapon use a 1HB or a peircing weapon so that you can
have +int items in your off hand. You main goal here is to try and get you
int as high as you can, worrying about what kind of weapon you will be using
later on in the game is not for a wizard, dont spend you skill points in any
weaponskill, spend in languages, research or tradeskills. If I were you i
would just keep saving them up till you decide.
