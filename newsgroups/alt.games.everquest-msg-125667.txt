}Poor grammar and spelling...
}Bonus marks for 'generousity'

I don't think Azjn used that word in his post... So I gotta assume that 
this is the fated misspelling that appears in every spelling flame.  Why 
does that happen?  It really seems to go beyond the bounds of mere 
coincidence, and right past where science could rationally explain it.

I think it's Murphy and his little band of gremlins.  They crawl through 
the workings of the internet and actually change your post after you've 
sent it, don't they?

/em triple checks for typos...
