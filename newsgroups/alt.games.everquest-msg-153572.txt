Do you really think the AoW, Gylphed/Cursed etc come willingly when the monk
pulls them?

Tormax is a trivial pull, and theres still a good chance of death running
him *single split* back to camp, when you take into account they are faster
than SoW, hit for close to or > 1000 a pop, and you slow down the moment
your raid comes into view..

We do less damage than chain classes (rouges, rangers) and they are going to
have better defensive skills.... right, that makes sense.
