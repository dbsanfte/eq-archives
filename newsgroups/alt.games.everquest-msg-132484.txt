Well, I found some.

Oddly, these numbers don't even come close to adding to 100%... and I 
don't see where it says what happened to the rest of the cases.

----- http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pubs/facts/hispanic.htm 
Proportion of US AIDS cases reported in 2000 among selected hispanics by 
exposure category and place of birth:

        US  Mexico Puerto Rico
MSM     30%  44%     14%
IDU     24%   9%     48%
Hetero  11%  14%     25%

From the beginning of the epidemic through December 2000, 114,019 Hispanic 
men have been reported with AIDS in the United States. Of these cases, men 
who have sex with men (MSM) \ represent 42%, injection drug users (IDUs) 
account for 35%, and 6% of cases were due to heterosexual contact. About 
7% of cases were among Hispanic men who both had sex with men and injected 
drugs. Among men born in Puerto Rico, however, injection drug use accounts 
for a significantly higher proportion of cases than male-male sex. 
------

So it does look like it's expanding into hetero hispanic populations (7% 
cumulative vs. 11-25% current) but it's debateable about how fast an 
expansion that represents.  I seem to recall, about 8 years ago or so, an 
ad campaign that suggested that by the year 2000, 1 in 4 or 5 people you 
know would have HIV.  That, at least, does not seem to have happened.  
(Whew!)
