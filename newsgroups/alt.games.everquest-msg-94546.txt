The hands-down best tool for this is Reed's Bard Song Analysis 
Spreadsheet, which has an updated verion out this week.  You can find it 
here:

Basically, most bard songs get a little bit better every two or four 
levels, but it's truly an incremental improvement.  The nice thing about 
being a bard is that we get a new song every level, so you almost alwasy 
have something to look forward to.  OK, granted the level 21 and 24 songs 
are damn near useless, but you have many to play with.
