So I was right then, it was the latter.  If you really want players to 
be forced to follow the MoB pathing you are quite the masochist.  If you 
missed the years of discussion on why MoB pathing isn't able to do what 
PCs are I'll explain it in a nutshell.  This game engine is freaking 
old!  They do what they can with it, but to program MoB pathing to be 
realistic would bring the servers to a grinding halt.  The physics 
issues you seem to have are indeed AI issues.  They don't follow the 
same physics we do because the level of calculation required to allow 
for that is prohibitive with the current engine.

EQ2, with its new engine will provide the realism you seek, but be 
careful what you ask for heh.  Playing SWG with its quite flexible 
pathing I've found myself more than once wishing the MoBs weren't quite 
so good at doing exactly what I am able to do heh.
