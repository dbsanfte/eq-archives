You can also try blocking people who are ahead of you.  That's what's
happening on my server (The Nameless).  A couple of guilds that are behind
Legacy of Steel but have a timezone advantage are rushing in and blowing
spawns that they can't take before LoS gets on.  Some will probably get in
trouble for this, since in some cases they have to exploit to get to where
they can blow the spawn for LoS.

Surprisingly, one of the guilds doing this is the major European uberguild
on the server.  Usually, it is the Asian guilds that do this kind of thing,
because they can get away with it easier, because of the language thing.
It's an amazingly effective defense when a GM comes to question you to be in
a big Taiwan guild and start saying "no ABC" whenever the GM asks you a
question.

If Sony ever hired a GM who speaks Chinese, there would be total panic
among a good portion of the Nameless' Taiwan guilds. :-)
