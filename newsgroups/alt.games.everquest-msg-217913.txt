When I switched to a Logitech mouse, my scroll wheel stopped working.
Applying numerous driver upgrades and enabling or disabling "Office
Compatibility" did nothing.

I just lived with it until I replaced my computer and got a new Microsoft
Mouse, and now the scroll wheel works again.

Sorry I can't give you a better answer.  I could never solve the riddle
myself.
