Agreed.  In general mob casters are more difficult than warrior-types.
Also, druid spells seem to be pretty effective in the context of EQ's
mob AI (such as it is).  The combination of nukes, dots, damage shields,
movement debuffs, and healing means that the more-or-less randomly
selected spell that the brownie casts is likely to be effective.

That said, they are very killable so long as you use tactics that
counter their strengths:
1) have a high MR,
2) dispell their buffs, don't stop until the DS is gone,
3) use two-handed weapons (all you Rangers who can't be bothered to
carry a two-hander for fights against DSed mobs might as well just
Snare and run screaming for the zone right now),
4) use dots/dds to hurt them without taking any damage from DS,
5) dispell that damned DS, he recast it
6) use stuns,
7) when grouped do whatever it takes to keep agro on the melee who
tanks best (yes, this is pretty obvious and generic, but for some
reason Rangers seem to feel a much stronger urge to tank when they're
in LFay),
8) dispell that damned DS, he recast it again
9) dispell that &^$%$#* DS!!!
10) where's a Wizard when you really need one?
