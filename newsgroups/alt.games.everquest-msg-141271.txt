No, but immediately jumping up and betting that the classes you're taking
are harder than anything somebody that you don't even know took in school
is not only dumb, but pretty immature as well.

"I bet my dad could beat up your dad."

I took 2 years of calc, including DifEq.  I have friends that would consider
what I took not hard because they happened to have Ph.Ds in some branches
of esoteric mathematics that I probably can't even pronounce.  Then again,
they probably couldn't get through Gross Anatomy, either.  And pretty much
anybody in any science department (including those Ecology dorks that
can't decide wether they study math OR biology) would laugh at a Lit
course described as "hard."

I, for one, can't WAIT for school to be back in session.  While there are
plenty of idiotic and immature 30 year olds, but they all must be in day
school, too...because when Aug/Sept rolls around, a lot of them must
have to be somewhere else, too...
