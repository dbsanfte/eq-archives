Some of those things are hard to come by, and the buy sell price 
differential offered by merchants on many of them isn't sane nevermind 
favourable (if you can even find them at merchants), it would be 
frustrating to see them go to a merchant.

If you've got the time, figure out what they're worth at the merchant 
and then simply do the math, let the people have what they want, and 
adjust their cash split accordingly. If there isn't enough cash to 
balance it, either get them to cough up some cash, or sell the excess. 
Perfectly fair, nobody loses out, and everybodies happy.

The only downside is that it does take an extra 3 or 4 minutes... and 
its amazing how impatient some people can be.

For a pickup group: everyone brings their own dots. No muss no fuss. For 
a guild group the same deal works best, unless the cleric is being 
compensated out of guild funds.

And even if you could afford them, sometimes you have have to draw the 
charity line.
