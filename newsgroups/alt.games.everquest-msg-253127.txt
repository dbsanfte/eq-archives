If I am thinking of the quest that Kaev is talking about then the piece in
question is only for Pure Melee's. Its kinda the bone that Warr/Rog/Monks
were thrown in LoY since they didnt get any quest spells. And hes absolutely
right.. the upgrade part going from 21% to 24% is a pita... required camping
mobs in the back end of Torgiran mines looking for yet another rare drop.

I did the quest for my Warrior, and went through the pain of the upgrade,
and had the item for all of 2 weeks when my Druid got a major Windfall ( won
the roll on a Thunderous Drum of Kerrana, and promptly sold it for 35k ),
and got my warrior a Soulscream belt.

Still was fun to have quested for the piece, and its always good for Nekkid
Corpse runs when needed ;)
