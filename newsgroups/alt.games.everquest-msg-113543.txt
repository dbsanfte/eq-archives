Since youre a chanter youll get used to being pestered by druids
non-stop for breeze, clarity and insight. Think how many times you
hear a druid saying "Trading sow for clarity...pst". I dont get
bothered all the time from other caster classes.....mainly druids. I
also have a druid and Ill tell you the pestering they get for sow,
buff and heal is about triple what my chanter gets...but they get it
from all classes, my chanter pretty much gets it from druids. Case in
point, im in an odd group of Enchanter, Ranger, Paladin and Beastlord
all in late teens low 20s. One of them made an over pull which
required me to mezz a whole mess of mobs. We all survived but everyone
took a beating....especially me cause there wasnt anyone to help me
out other than my color spray stun and re mezz.......even then I get
interrupted while casting. We feel good for a job well done. A druid
walks up and asks "Can I get a breeze, plz". I had 2 bubbles of health
after the fight and I just wait and see if he offers a heal or sow of
some sort. The wait continues. "Are you going to breeze me or not?"  
/ignore dipshit

Hopefully you dont end up as cynical as I. Its a game...have fun.
