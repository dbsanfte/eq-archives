Hi all,

after the last patch, where SOE announced to eliminate the lag people had
when new chars came into zone, this problem got even worse now .... Walking
around in highpopulated areas like Nexus is very hard now if not impossible
in peakhours ...

Btw, my computer and connection is not the fault as the components are WAY
over the requirements; also all new drivers / directx are on it ... And I am
not the only one experiencing this .... ( same problem in nearly the whole
guild and even with other ISPs we tried after we have been told our
connection would be the problem ... tried connection DSL/Dialup/direct
access 100 MBit at backbone).

Today when I asked the GM in chat about a solution for my problem I was told
if I dont like it I should switch to SWG ... After this annoying answer I
said "ok, maybe an alternative as maybe they will be able to offer support
and maybe the team will know their job" ... guess what ... KICKED OF CHAT
...

I brought up my second account to verify if it may have been a breakdown in
connection ... answering a question about why SOE-support doesnt answer
emails with my experiences I have made (" Its SOE, will take a few days,
then you ll get an automated email that will tell you its your fault or the
fault of your ISP") .... KICKED OF CHAT ...

So, I know the Motd a few weeks agao was not to use harsh words in game
(your account will be banned !) ... and I still see this as prevention to
threaten people not to tell the other chars what they think about the
b$ullsh$t SOE has done with their patches these days ....

Now censored in chat too ? Great, you are not allowed to tell others your
experiences with this "company" or opinion about their "support" (if you
want to call it that way ... ) anymore ?

WOOT, great work SOE .... next expansion will include the exchange of 50
percent of your "team" ? No matter how expensive it might be ... Iï¿½ll buy it
!!!!


Christian
