I do the same thing.  Real bards tell me that its better to write
hotkeys so as to 

/stopsong
/cast 1

saving a step (the double click) and allowing the use of the
keyboard (not hotkeying entire twists, still, but just each
song), but I switch my song list around with some frequency, and
find having the actual icons visisble to be more helpful than the
hotkey solution, plus I'm used to double clicking.

OF course my bard was just an alt to fool around with, when
things slowed down I moved on to another character, as usual, so
I only got him to level 57; perhaps "real" bards all use the
hotkey solution
