No offense, but last I checked, the 55 WIZ nukes were nothing to sneeze 
at. So what if you're not in the top three damage dealers on a mob, as 
long as you do do some significant damage. I would never consider a 
wizard useless.  I think anyone who does is just being a bit short-
sighted.

I've played most classes some. Granted, I've not played any to 55, but on 
a raid, the more people doing damage the better, I say. Having a wizard 
(or two or three...) to either help nuke the mob down and/or finish it 
off is a big bonus.

KEI is not needed to make the game fun - only to make it easy. It's like 
playing a FPS on the Rookie setting (or "Don't Hurt Me" setting a la 
Doom) with auto-aim turned on.

As always, just my 2cp worth.
