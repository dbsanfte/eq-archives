I remember reading about a month or two ago that one of the Windows Updates
for Win XP was bugged and caused lag issues with EQ. I was having the lag
problems and removed that update and found that it seemed to fix the
problem.

Well, since then, I've downloaded some updates and am now noticing the lag
has seemed to pick up a bit. I wanted to check to see if I had re-installed
the update that was bugged, but have lost what the number of the update is.
Would anyone out there happen to know which update it is?

Thanks in advance for your help.
