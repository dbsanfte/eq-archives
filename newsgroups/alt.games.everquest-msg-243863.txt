Yeah, I wonder how many enchanters are unaware of that? A ranger using
archery has to be careful of mobs in the direct line of fire. But
enchanters and main tanks should be aware that if the target is moving
around, an arrow can go astray, and there is a significant delay
between when a ranger shoots and when the arrow arrives, more than
most people realize (and its gotten longer with the new archery
change).
