Correct. You can raise all specialization fields to 50, but only one may go
higher. The one that goes higher is your specialized field.

From how it sounds, I think you should specialize in Evocation. Unless you
intend on partnering a lot with melees I think specializing in Alteration
would go to waste since you like to solo with DDs, and it's not like Snare
and Root cost a lot to cast.
