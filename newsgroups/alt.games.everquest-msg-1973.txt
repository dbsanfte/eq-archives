Relax, take a deep breath, and look at the subject of every post in
this thread.
I believe your grief stems from using the word 'need' in this one
instance :)

And, although I think it's a nice idea (better than armor and weapons
wearing out or everything being lore no drop), it's not something I
really see a need for. I think I once read something to the effect
that Verant doesn't really like people timing spawns, having a watch
around isn't that much of a stretch (I am so brilliant, I set the
clock on my VCR :p) and /time covers the basic needs. 
Commands like /time and /lore are out of character enough as it is;
adding compasses on screen, HUD style mapping or more extensive in
game clocks would be too much IMHO. (I consider /gems a mind game :) )
