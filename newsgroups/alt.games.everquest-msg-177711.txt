What server are you on?  On mine all of Freeport is just as empty as Qeynos or
Erudin.  For that matter there are *still* zones where there is no soulbinder
and should be, (Thurgadin comes to mind.  Although thanks to the POK book it's
certainly not the pain in the hiney it used to be).

*If* there was a caster in the zone, of course I would go ask.  *If* they
looked like they weren't busy or naked.  I think it's rude to bother someone
who is clearly getting ready for their own corpse run or obviously in
conversation with someone else.  Or busy tradeskilling for that matter.

On my server you can't bind in the tunnel.  And again, I *would* /ooc my
request, but I think it's rude to bother someone who is OBVIOUSLY busy trying
to sell something and doesn't respond of their own free will.

I never spam, and I never /shout.  An /ooc every 15 minutes was not spamming in
the old days, when you *had* to get a bind from *someone*.  If a caster doesn't
respond to a polite /ooc *I* think it's rude to send them a /tell.  Obviously
if they were bored they would offer to come bind you.
Spam is bombarding the zone with your noise, auctions, complaints, or whatever.
 I've never done that, and I *have* been known to /ignore people who do.
The point of my post was that *some* things about the "good ole days" weren't
all that good.
