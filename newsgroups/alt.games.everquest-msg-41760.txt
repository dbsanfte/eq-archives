Thank you.

I don't know how, but Canada seems to have come out 
extraordinarily fortunate in all this - last I heard, 
there was only one Canadian loss so far?  Not that 
that's good news for the family and friends of that 
person, of course, but when I think of the others that 
have lost so many ...

I'd just like to say, I am very proud to be Canadian.  
When I watch the news and see the Canadian Red Cross 
telling people *not* to give blood until a couple of 
weeks have passed because they have more than they need 
after yesterday.  When I read that elective surgeries 
are being cancelled *just in case* the beds are needed, 
and that medical personnel are ready to go down and help 
if needed.  Groups of volunteers wanting to aid in 
search and rescue... I am so proud of the people living 
here right now, and I wish I were brave enough to be 
such a person.

To everybody in Canada who is giving their all, a big, 
big, big hug, and to everybody in Canada that has 
overflowed our blood supply, a big, yet gentle hug with 
a cookie :)

I have a lot more hope than I did two days ago.  There 
is still a lot of undirected hate out there, but 
thankfully, I'm seeing a lot less of it from the friends 
and people I respect.  And again, I'm proud of and happy 
for them - I have seen one girl who actually watched the 
whole disaster, and was a part of it, shout down someone 
who was demanding carpet bombing and the complete 
wipeout of a nation.  To remain in control of yourself 
in that situation... it's all very well for me to sit 
here, miles away, and say "please, we can't do anything 
rash" - but to watch the death and destruction and still 
come out of it able to say "I will not hate like that, 
and I will not support that hate"...

Okay, I need to go before I start crying again :) I just 
wanted to say that I'm proud of both our countries 
today.  I'm also proud of, and grateful for, the voices 
of other countries who have chimed in to voice their 
support and to let everyone know that they are there - 
and if unable to do much to help from so far away, are 
there as a voice of comfort and support.
