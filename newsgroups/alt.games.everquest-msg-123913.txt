I think basically that the new caster rules are better, but it has broken
the CON design now. If a blue can easily kill you and do so with ease (which
they do at higher levels), then that means the CON design is broken. It's
abit unbalanced IMHO, since over 50th level, a blue MOB is actually tougher
than you because they use different tables. Enhanced mana pools, enhanced
melee skills, enhanced casting times, enhanced hitpoints etc. They should
redesign the MOB CONs and XP for defeating them, or actually bring the MOBs
into a balanced perspective.
