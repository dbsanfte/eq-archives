IIRC the max int for a high elf is 127. 127-115=12 int points. At level 13 12
int points = 31 mana. Not that big a deal, but I would still recommend
starting over. Why? I had a druid I took up to level 46. I initially put 20
points into WIS instead of 25. I always regretted doing that. Since you will
be tweaking yourself, getting back up to level 13 should not be that big a
deal.

At low levels, look for +mana items replacing them with +int items as you
level.  Frosted Mantle, Golden Jaded Bracelet x 2, Skull of Jhen'Tra, Chipped
Bone Collar, and Jaded Silver Ring x2 will give you +80 mana, +3 sv magic,
+ac and +hp and you could probably buy them all for just over 100pp.
