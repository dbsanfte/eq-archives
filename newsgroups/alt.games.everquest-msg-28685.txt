Have you done any quests?  urn in bone chips, scorpion pincers and scaled
wolf pup hides for cash and/or loot.  Also, try LoIO sabretooths.  They drop
pelts which you can tailor into patchwork, I believe.  Also, turn in watcher
torches for loot and the goblins begin to carry gold.

It is more difficult to come by, but the money is there.
