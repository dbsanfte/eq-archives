Yeah, I guess that is a good point. I read (and posted about) a pretty 
negative thread about this server on TNZ though. It seems some people 
are pretty upset that it is a "transfer server" and this ruins it in 
their minds. The prediction of these folks being that Morder Rasp will 
be a low population failure.

I find that possibility pretty dissapointing. I was hoping it would be a 
fun place with all or mostly low level people and that this would be a 
great and fun place to play. But perhaps seeing for myself would be the 
best way to assess this as you say.
