If you can solo, you have the time to play. It's being forced to group,
raid, etc that chews up your time, which might be fine if you are single,
but if you have other commitments, or are just tired other "{class, level}
LFG! PST!" then your interest wanes.

If nothing had been changed then he would have had an effective character,
able to solo to level 60, like many others did before him. I used to be able
to solo a drolvarg, and even with imbued fighter staff, phase spider
carapace etc etc post nerf I can't. I'm working around it by fighting in
jaggedpine, but for me the point of dimishing returns has come in play, and
i'll never enjoy playing the monk class as much as i did pre-nerf, because
I'll never be able to devote the time to the raids required to make the nerf
irrelevant.
