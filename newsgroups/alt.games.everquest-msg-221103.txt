I agree with James.

Why should it be that easy?  Giving the class with the best ability to 
defend the best ability to gain aggro does not help with balance.  

I believe they should make that tanking ability more valuable and 
sought after rather than make all classes the same.  That is after all 
exactly what warriors are complaining about with respect to the tanking 
skills of hybrids isn't it?
