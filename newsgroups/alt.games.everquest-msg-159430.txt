Of course I didn't say you said anything about "all druids"
and that should be clear since I mentioned both druids and
wizards in my reply.

Quadding has it's problems.  So does *every* other means
of gaining XP.  The problems you mention aren't unique.
Training, for instance, is just as common in places where
there isn't quadding than others;  KC is a great example.
Groups pulling "more than their fair share" is common
everywhere;  try pulling in OS (pre-PoP) in an all-60s
group, for instance.

Most of the problems you mention have their equivalents in
full groups (training, "over"-pulling, etc) and aren't
unique to quadding.  If you don't want to be trained, don't
sit on the tracks.  If you think that person quadding is
taking more than their share, go find another spot and be
glad as hell he doesn't have a full group there.  And so
on.  There's plenty of moron quadders.  There's also plenty
of morons playing other classes with other styles.

Personally, anyone who tells me to "die rather than train"
tends to get ignored.  I personally would rather get distance
and Gate simply because I'm reasonably sure any place where
training a zone is an option for me I can be sure that there
will be one or two groups doing the same when I need to zone...
