Remove Curse: but since its a spell used by people in their late
50s and that can't realistically be gotten by a group of level 39
people, the parallel with the spell you are discussing is clear;
some spells appear at weird points in the spell list.

Here's another: tiny companion, a level 19 shaman spell.. which
is used to shrink their pet, but they don't get a pet till level
34 (or level 29 if you want to count charmed pets, but I don't
think it works on those).  Or Reclaim Energy, a level one mage
spell which can't be used till they first get pets at level 4...
and isn't really useful till somewhere up in the 44+ range, by
which point you'll almost certainly be using a clicky proc on an
item to get the effect free rather than kill part of your mana
gain by casting it.

 My question is why make Remove Minor

Adam mentioned one reason: Less Fizzles.  Another might be that
it spells may be coded at a set price in adventure points based
on their level, and by making it level 9 it is cheaper.  Or
perhaps they found more "room" for spells at level 9 than at 19. 
Its SOE, sometimes their reasoning is beyond mortal kenning.
