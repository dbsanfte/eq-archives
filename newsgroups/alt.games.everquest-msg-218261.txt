Not to my knowledge.  Quick targetting is one of the things that separates 
the good CCers from the not-so-great CCers.

F8 is THE DEVIL.  I've seen so many adds caused by shaman hitting f8 and 
not paying attention to what they're actually targetting before casting.  
They're the only ones I've seen do this so far.

If you're having that much trouble, root as you slow and have the tank 
separate the rooted mobs from the ones that still need slowing by backing 
up a few paces.  There is however a happy medium to this.  Having the tank 
just stand there does no good, but having the tank run around in circles 
for 10 minutes does even less as all the melees can't hit anything and it 
makes it even harder for you to target the adds (had a tank do this once, 
without the CCers asking him to separate at all, in fact they told him to 
stop running around like an idiot; he quickly made it onto my "never 
again" list).  This should really only be necesary when you have 3 or more 
adds stacked up and nobody to mez/charm/offtank.
