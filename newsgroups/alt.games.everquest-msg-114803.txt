At least you didn't get bitched at by everyone who [couldn't gate/was stupid
enough to bind in Vox's lair] after you killed Vox to change your bind point
from somewhere on the ass end of the moon to Vox's lair and give everybody
rides out.

I was the only druid on the raid, and we had no wizards, and the idiots said
it was my job to get them all out, this being AFTER I spent over an hour
getting late arrivals there in the first place (and was required for Circle
of Summer)

Plus, the raid leader decided that he got the rez stick by merit (though he
did put 10k cash up to replace it), which pissed me the hell off (he was a
warrior) since everyone expected to roll on everything (although 2 paladins
got merits of books, 3 books dropped and we had 4 pallies, so no one really
cared except the paladin that didn't get a book).  Oh, and I lost on the bag
to a 956 when I had a 938 (second highest doesn't get me baggies)

Two people had asked me for a port out before we were done with loot
distribution, I took them out, but afterwards I just shouted "first 3 tells
gets ride out, rest of you, sorry.", which meant I got 18 tells out of 24
people there, ended up porting an enchanter and cleric out because they were
stupid enough to bind in the prep hall.

God, idiot melees need to invest 50pp and an hour and get pottery to 122 so
they can make Thurgadin gate potions to bail their lazy asses out of such
situations.
