Why not?  I got a bit bored and frustrated with my warrior on Firiona 
Vie, and didn't want to just reroll/delete her.  I've played on several 
blue servers and they all seemed more or less the same.  So why not a 
red server?

Actually, the conversation you see there wasn't changed much.  There was 
a bit of trash talking but no profanity, no mockings of "n00b!"  I'd 
figured out when making my character there that playing on SZ meant that 
I *was* going to be PK'd.  The mezzing thing took me by surprise, but I 
was more amused than anything.  And I found that keeping a sense of 
humor and refusing to be riled was an effective weapon, at least with 
the two in the tale.

The story may *not* be continued, who knows.  The experiment may turn 
out to be a bust, or I may do what I *often* to, and (fickle-like) start 
a new character (perpetual re-roller, me).

So far, though, I'm having fun, and actually I tend to see less people 
than on FV; Zekna is usually alone or in the company of less than four 
other people in Shar Vahl and Shadeweaver's Thicket.  I suspect Paludal 
Caverns is different, but I don't intend to go there.  And what some red 
server players have said is true; the game *is* different when you know 
that it's not just the programmed (and often stupid) MOBs to watch out for.
