You'll eventually need Kunark to do your epic quest.  I think every
epic quest involves at least one Kunark item.  There are many other
quests involving Kunark that you might want to do, too.  Suggestion:
go to Allakhazam's and look at the quest list that lists the quests by
zone.  That table shows for each zone how many quests start in that
zone, and how many involve that zone.  Check out the Kunark zones and
see if there are any quests you'll want to do.

There's nothing that immediately requires Kunark at your level.
There's plenty of hunting in the original game for you now, and in
Velious starting in another 15 levels or so, although Kunark would
give you quite a bit more variety now, so the thing to do might be to
keep an eye out for a bargain and snag it then.

Do you know anyone who could put the files on a CD-ROM an mail them to
you?
