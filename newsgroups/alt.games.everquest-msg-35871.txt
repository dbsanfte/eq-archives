that lizzie place over near feeroot is where I hunted with my enchanter  its
good for 25th to 35th.   Enchanters and clerics are definite assets to any
party.  it shouldn't be hard to find a party if your looking in the right
spot.  you should turn on your LFG.
GUk also is a good place to hunt, as is mistmoore for 30th.  Lower guk for
30th +.  maybe even lower guk for 30th if your careful and find a good party
who needs clarity.

I'd suggest getting a list of all the various zones and looking at treasure
for what your interested in.  Your bound to find something you want that you
can work towards.  With Velious and Kunark out, there is a ton more places
to hunt for stuff.  You definitely want to join up with at least one other
person.  Druids and rangers are good people to join up with if no one else
is joining.  Snare and fear works great.  even better is an enchanter +
druid or ranger + rogue (backstab).   snare and fear doesn't work well in
dungeons.
