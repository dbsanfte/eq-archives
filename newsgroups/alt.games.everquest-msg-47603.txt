Heya
I have read that the Ink of the Dark is no drop when the ghoul returns it,
but I have also heard of other people being able to do that part and give
the ink to the enchanter. I am asking because my Bloodsabre faction is as
low as it can get, and I dont really wanna go around killin the good
guards... =)
Would appreciate if anyone can tell me, thanks
