    Bah, don't ask me to name what the Iksar Hate armour is called. :-)
After Iksar complained long and loud, the classes that couldn't wear the
Temple of Solusek Ro quest armour got Iksar replacements. The other quest
NPCs for SHMs and SKs are in Cabilis, so their quests are listed there.
You'll be disappointed to note that their quests are even easier than yours.

    And I'll say again: AVOID THE ODD MOLE! Here's the scoop on this pest:
he has the drop you need for one of the pieces. He spawns in the "dining
room" at the top of Kurn's Tower (more on that later). He's tough enough
that a group that gets XP up there will have major issues with him - I
remember him being in the low to mid-20's by how hard he hits. He spawns
something like once every hour or so RL time. He comes barelling out of a
ruined archway across from the entry to the Dining Room, runs back and forth
for maybe a tick, then despawns unless engaged. Oh, and he's the size of
Krode the Diviner in The Warrens, if not smaller - about as big as a dwarf's
foot. You will piss yourself off like you cannot imagine trying to target
and attack this mighty mite while the room's skeletons keep repopping and
attacking you. I finally got him by standing Delores in the path I'd last
seen him run, loading my fastest-casting point blank AoE spell, and casting
as soon as I saw him appear. And I barely got him aggroed in time. (I let
the Iksar warrior in question beat the snot out of him in revenge for the
two times so far that day she'd been eluded by him.)
