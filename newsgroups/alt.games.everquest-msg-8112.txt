Nice -- but I'd be happy with about half that...

I'd like the ability to log in to my characters
via a simple text-based application that would run even
on outdated non-3D-graphics computers.  Any "text-login"
characters temporarily appear (via /who) to be in a
"virtual zone" (a name of "Limbo" would be amusing),
so that people wouldn't be running around trying to
find you in <insert the zone name where you camped here>
or invite you into a hunting group, etc.

You could /guildchat and /tell and /who and not much
else.

The application would be small and run standalone (no
special installation required) and would work fine when
simply run from a floppy.

The idea would be that you could pop in from non-EQ-enabled
places (work, a friend's house, the public library internet
terminals, etc.) and make plans for that evening's guild
event, arrange for your messy corpse retrieval, pass along
important news to friends in the game, etc.

Call it EQ-ICQ if you will.  :-)
