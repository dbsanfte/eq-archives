Refering to first aid, or the warrior specific bandage wounds?  FA means you
can bind over the 70% cap.  After run3 this was the next thing I maxed, so I
can bind wound to 100%.   Now if I ever had room for bandages, it might be
usful... unfortunately I never carry them.. oh well.

First aid is also a prequisite for critical mend, I've had level 2 in this
for a fww months now.. I guess im "satisfied" with it.. think it rly should
have a far higher percentage chance to work.
