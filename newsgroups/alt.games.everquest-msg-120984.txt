    Base WIS, 113. HP/AC cleric - Velium Fire rings, Electrum Black Sapphire
ears. No epic. No Ethereal Mist BP - just a Seb Scale Tunic. Scowled at the
idea of wearing GEBs - had Worked Dragonhorn boots from WW. Had a few pieces
of Thurg Plate - the zero WIS gloves, the 2 WIS bracer, the 2 WIS arms. Wore
a Skull-Shaped Barbute on my head. As you can see, not a lot of WIS there.
Oh, and my standard cloak was a Cloak of the Ice Bear, for CR.

    James
