I have a lvl 7 Wizard & 15 Paladin.  I have been trying to figure out what
item quests and drops would be within their range to attain.

So far I have found many places to search based on usage slot, stat
increase, etc...

Is there somewhere I can search by level attainable.  (i.e. search for all
the items a lvl 7 wizard could actually complete a quest for or kill the
appropriate mob.)

thanks.
