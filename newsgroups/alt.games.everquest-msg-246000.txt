}i'm trying to make hand made backpacks, but the only place i know to fight

}bear/rockhopper pelts?

They are both moderately rare off any mob type that can drop them.  Hence, 
your best bet is the place where you can kill the most of such a type in a 
given time.  Everfrost polar bear cubs are good, and needle-clawed hoppers 
are good in Shadeweaver.

Honestly, though, I've gotten the most HQ pelts by vendor diving in newbie 
areas, shortly after patches.  New players are frequently not aware they 
have value. :)

}also, do rockhopper pelts combine better than bear, or is it only my
}imagination?

I vote for imagination, but I have no absolutely concrete proof. :)  The 
recipes trivial at the same level.

}which drop more HQ pelts, bear or rockhopper?

Rockhoppers seem to drop slightly more.  But again, that could be chalked 
up to imagination.  I also find a lot more HQ rockhopper hides on 
merchants... I think players are even less aware of their value than the 
HQ bear. :)
