Well, let's face the facts. If Casey Webster posts one thing to a Usenet
newsgroup, and Alan "Absor" posts something completely opposite on a VI
developer's board, a lot of folks are going to go with Absor's answer.

Fortuantely, he double checked and corrected himself.

As to "known for quite a while", it wasn't universal, since it was
"known for quite a while" that the pet still got 1% of the xp even if it
didn't do more than 50%, but that's apparently not true either.
