What do you mean by equivalent?  Something with a similar ratio, and the 40+
delay for the extra damage bonus?

Ton Po's Bo Stick of Understanding, 44 damage, 40 delay, droppable, from OS,
that's Kunark era.  No clue what it would sell for though, and admittedly,
no stats on it, so that does sort of suck, but, damage wise, it's pretty
damned close.

It's a 1.1 ratio vs 1.136 ratio for the Windblade.
