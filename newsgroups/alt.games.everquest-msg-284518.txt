Its possible.  I havent played in awhile, but back in the day there was a 
problem a few people had where they could login to one character but not 
another.  It turned out that different zones use different ports, and they 
change.  So if you have some ports blocked you wont be able to zone into 
some zones if they happen to like that port this week.  Somewhere on their 
site it spells out which range of ports you need to have open, and I think 
it also will tell you how to do it.  Try the knowledgebase.
