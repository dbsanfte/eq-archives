Well, for me.  Id not remove them.  In fact it could be quite
enjoyable.  Id, make some comment to the individual... Ok since you
admit your weakness, please take all leads from  soandso. (could be
myself or maybe another druid that is in group and familiar with
tactics in the dungeon)
The very fact that the individual came in and gave a heads up on a
weakness in the group, will only make us stronger, for knowing our
limitations.

Know Thyself.... now why the hell would I punish someone for knowing
their weaknesses, and while they are attempting to improve on that
area.
