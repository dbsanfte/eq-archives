I quit EQ about 1 year ago, because I was a lvl 56 necro and I was
very frustrated about how no groups wanted me in the planes because I
couldn't help the group and also because not many groups need a necro.
So that left me soloing in skyfire. Normally I couldn't find a cleric
when I died and the rezz that the necro's got were ridiculous because
you had to kill a lvl 45 or above to get the stones....anyway I did
really have some good times in EQ 
1. I won't ever forget killing the AC in SRO. I never could figure out
how to exactly make him spawn, but when he did, my heart actually
pumped faster because I felt like I was seeing a 14 buck in real
life..so far that hasn't happened to me in Dark ages of camelot
2.When I was lvl 40, I had NEVER heard of Quillmane. I saw this white
horse flying through SK and he conned green. I figured what the heck I
might as well kill him. I did and he dropped the cloak of pegasus!!!!
That was neat, even though DMF worked better....
3. I LOVED fighting in lower GUK even though it got a bit crowded at
times.
I guess I could go on a bit more, but I think Dark ages of Camelot
could use some of the stuff that EQ has and I think EQ could use some
of the stuff that DAOC has. I mean what do you do in EQ after you
reach lvl 60? You should be able to RVR. But at the same time I think
that DAOC should have some things in it like the Ancient cyclops or
Quillmane. All in all though Both games are very good, currently I am
a lvl 42 pally in DAOC and I have a great time RVRing. If EQ could do
that, maybe my old necro could do something useful......anyway just
some thoughts.
