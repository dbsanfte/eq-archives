I couldnt agree more with this. Roleplay might be difficult at first but i
think it really can add a whole new dimension to the game in fitting with its
persistent world status. Im more into exploration and quests than just hack and
slash because for a hack and slash only game, EQ aint that great, Severance
beats it hands down.
I cant wait until i get the bind spell because then im just going to load up on
food, water and bone chips and head out for some adventure, i was going to go
before bind but im not 'that' adventurous ;) As a Dark Elf Necromancer
travelling is going to prove interesting but thats what im looking forward to.
No SoW's, no Ports, just me my pet and my backpack. It always astounds me the
amount of people that would rather port to where they need to be instead of
running (i always hear people shouting for ports to lavastorm in EC! by the
time they get one they could have been there and back 8 times over) The idea of
a big wide world is so that theres plenty to see do and explore and thats the
first thing that attracted me to mmorpg. As i said im looking forward to my
nomadic life and i think what you do in EQ is limited by your imagination, look
at Fansy the famous bard hehe.
