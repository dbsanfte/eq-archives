I can indeed... which is why, in a section you snipped out, I said

F) Mobs like the Sleeper being blown by wandering guilds.  OK, Sleeper 
was lame anyway.  But I do feel your pain on the other "high quality 
targets".  On the other hand, I feel that they too, are lame; if I want 
to go after uber mob X, then I should be able to, even if it means 
moving to another server where its not camped.  Doesn't matter if thats 
the final boss mob of the whole game, or just Emperor Crush.  Of the 
lot, though, this is the only one I have any sympathy for; using mob 
rarity is a design choice they made, and my idea pretty much breaks that 
idea.

Free transfer between servers and rare spawn raid level mobs aren't 
ideas that coexist well, I'll admit.  But I made that point before you did!
