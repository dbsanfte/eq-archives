}smith with 200 wis and 25 str?

In theory.  Verant has said it is so, and no one has come up with evidence 
that blatantly contradicts it.  It is not known for certain if 
200str/25int is as good as 200str/200int.  Verant says it is, but in the 
past they have said differently.  And nobody has tested it with a large 
enough data set to be absolutely sure.  But it's probably the same.

}Does he succeed as often?

Yes.  Stats have no bearing on success of combines.

}I'm so muddled!
