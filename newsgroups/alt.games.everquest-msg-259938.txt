Having used a variety of ADSL connections in different countries one thing
that I have noticed is that in order to get full speed download, you need
about 1/4 the bandwidth in upload, just to get the ACK packets back to the
source. Any time you have worse than 1:4 up/down ratio your download speed
will suffer because of the piss-poor upload speed.

More importantly, if you saturate your upload link, then your lag will go
all to hell.

Now, 1:4 is my personal limit ... and you are used to 1:1. Your new cable
service is 1:6, which I wouldn't touch, but as always YMMV.
