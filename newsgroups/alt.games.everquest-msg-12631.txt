	I wasn't bashing Verant.

	There is a quest in Erudin that doesn't work, and hasn't
worked since the game was released.  This is not Verant bashing.  This
is an irrefutable statement of fact.  =)

	If you've ever done the Avenger Axe quest, or if you've ever
read about the Avenger Axe quest, that's one that was probably very
frustrating to the first people to figure it out.

	The first part of the quest involves killing a 20ish NPC in
Qeynos.  The NPC spawns behind a false wall near the Qeynos Rogues
guild.  If he isn't attacked, he will eventually (within a few
minutes) leave his spawn point and walk out of Qeynos.  He will walk
towards the Qeynos/Qeynos Hills zone line, and will *poof* if he
reaches it.

	I remember doing this quest and looking at spoiler sites and
*still* not knowing exactly where the NPC spawned, nor did I know how
often he spawned.  Everyone knew that he spawned "somewhere inside
Crow's," but that was it.  I finally managed to figure out (after a
lot of patient waiting) that he spawns right behind the first fake
wall leading to the Rogue's Guild, and he's on a 90-minute timer.
(And he has placeholders, which means that you might go a good, long
time before seeing him.)  

	But before I figured out where he spawns and how often he
spawns, there was the usual advice given to me by people who knew less
about him than I did:  "They have an anti-camping code on him.  He
won't spawn if you're next to his spawn point."  "He's a triggered
spawn and won't show up until you talk to the folks at the NPC camp in
Dagnor's Cauldron."  Etc etc etc.

	So this is an example of a quest that, at the time, was
frustrating even *with* the assistance of spoiler sites.

	Imagine being the first player to fall down the well in
Befallen...
