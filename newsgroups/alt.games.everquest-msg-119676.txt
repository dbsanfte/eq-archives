Yes, druids can visit Plane of Growth with no fear, as long as they do not do
anything aggressive there.  (In fact, there are several quests for Tunare
druids, rangers and paladins there.)

While you are there, do *not* heal anyone.  Do not buff anyone.  Do not help
to kill anything, in any way.  The faction hits are massive, and within *very*
few kills... perhaps 10 or so,  your own god will be ready to destroy you.
(which kind of makes it hard to do the quests.)
