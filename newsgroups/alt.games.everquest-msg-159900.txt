On another note, has anybody ever fallen off the bridge leading from
SH to PC?  A non-caster friend (who really, really should have
listened when I said "let me jump first, I can gate out if it's a
problem") leapt without looking and got stuck for a good half hour.
People kept shouting "look up at the roof and you'll swim right out"
but I have a suspicious feeling they weren't actually looking at what
we were describing, since the walls around that sucker are about 2-3
times as high as a PC.  Eventually, a nice druid came and ported us
out.  Only she didn't.  We gathered together on one of the beams under
the bridge, standing as close as possible, and she hit the port
button.  And we got left behind.  She said she'd had that problem
other places, and to jump in the water.  So we did, and she hit 'port'
again and we got left behind again.  Finally ended up squooshing my
friend up as high on the beam as we could get her and I /duel killed
her (thank goodness she was bound in SH), and she ran back and got her
corpse.
