You're not looking ahead. Regardless of whether EQ2 was released, WoW
was going to take a big chunk of the playerbase, Vanguard will take
yet more, and other more minor mmorpgs will nickel and dime EQ1 away.
If SOE didn't move forward it would have had the mmorpg equivalent of
the dinosaur. You can't keep convincing newbies to come into the game
when there are demonstrably better and far newer games coming out no
matter what gimmicks were used. There *is* a limit to how far you can
take mudflation and still have the players able to get their heads
around it.

I can't count how many people were only playing EQ until something
better came along and most of them knew better *was*.

So I don't blame SOE for their moves at all.
