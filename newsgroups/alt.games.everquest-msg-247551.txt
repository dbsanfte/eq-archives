 No one was there in the first place. Thats why I couldn't solo either
on my own. As for leaving, I shouldn't have to regardless of Sony's
view on not recognizing camps. Common courtesy says if someones there
you ask first, not rush in and muck things up. If they would have ask
if they could have I would have left, maybe even ask if I could join
with the low level toon. Their behaviour is what started all this, not
mine.
