Wyker,

I have the Wireless version of your router, also a V2.  The problem was
intermitent for me until recently, when we determined that there is an isp
problem.

However, if you go the everquest homepage, then go to the technical forums,
you can do a search for linksys and see a fix listed.  It is from a user
name turtoni.

Basically, on May 8th patch, sony did a large change on teh backside to how
they handle certain communications.  What is happening on the disconnect is
that your router is not keeping the UDP ports open long enough.  My bet is
that you are going LD about every 10 or 15 minutes pretty regular.

The fix listed works for me.  SOme people have no problems but most of those
folks have the non-V2 version and have downgraded their firmware.

Turtoni gives very explicit steps and you should have no problem setting up
the fix.

Good luck.
