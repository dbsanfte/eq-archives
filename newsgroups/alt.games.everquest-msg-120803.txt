Ry'goor Armor = Very Nice, but not just in reach for a lvl 23, unless he 
                is weighed down by plat :-) 

Anyway, there are a lot of items with +STR which is quest able or can be 
purchased for a reasonable amount of plat - 
ie. try look for a Jagged Band +5 Str = 100pp  
              or a Amber Ring +2 Str = 20 - 50pp for a Pair.

Good Luck and don't overdo the strength thing, I am WE Ranger myself,
lvl 40
and strength of 125 (buffed), but my dex and agi is much higher :-)
