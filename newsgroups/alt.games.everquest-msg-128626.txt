Replace these with Forest Loops if you can...  Or go full Gold Jaspers.

> Neck: Lesser Talisman of Wistfulness  AC 2 cha wis int 3

Get a Black Alloy Medallion.  AC6 with Wis/Int 5

> Face: Turquoise Eyepatch AC Sta Cha Int 3

Silver or Plat Ruby Veil, Velium if you are lucky.

> Head: Leather Skullcap AC 4

Get either Runed Circlet, Zaharan's Cornet or better yet, Othmir Fur Cap.

> Finger: Silver Jasper Wis 2
> Finger: Ruby Electrum Str 4 Wis 2

Gold Ruby Rings better, more wis, unless you REALLY need the STR.

> Wrist: Coterie Wristbands AC 6 int 1 HP 3  svf -1
> Wrist: Leather Wristbands AC 3

Better to get Runed Mithril Bracers.  Slightly better AC than leather,
Gives Wis and STR.

> Arms: Leather Sleaves AC 3

Get Ulthork Sleeves, the AC and Wis will help, even for the ding on Int.
Later, go to Plat Armbands or when you hit your 40s, get ES Sleeves for
hunting.

> Hands: Split Paw Hide Gloves AC 4 dex 3 wis 2

Right now, short of the ES Gauntlets for hunting (Manaless Snare, but only
works when you are 45) you are good here.  Not many decent AC/Wis druid
wearable gloves out there.

> Shoulders: Coterie Sholderpads AC 6 int 1 HP 3  svf -1

Get Braided Ivy Cords.  More Wis, Int and the 3 hp won't help...  Prayer
Shawl if you can afford it.

> Chest: Cured Tizmak Sircoat AC 15 SVM 7

Foreman's Tunic.  Or Acrylia Reinforced Tunic.  Foreman's Tunic will go a
long ways for you though if you can't afford an ART.

> Back: Cloak of the Ice Bear AC 8 HP 10 SVC 20

Look for Kunzar Cloak, again, for Wis.  At your level, you could use as
much wis as you can get.

> Waist: Leather Belt AC 3

Crystalline Belt if you can afford it.

> Legs: Drake-hide Leggings AC 5 dex cha 5

Go to Upper Guk and camp Ancient Croc...  See if you can get gatorscale
leggings.

> Feet: Patchwork Boots AC 3

Either Dwarven Work Boots, buy leather boots.  If you can afford it, Golden
effreti boots.

> Primary: Koada'Dal Falchion of Tunare 7/24 str wis 3

> Range: Small Wisdom Deity wis 2
> Ammo:

Look at getting Bone Handled Scimitar, or Dark Ember.  Better stats and
damage than the weapon you got.  Also look at getting a hold of a Paw of
Opolla.  While it dings you with the Disease and Cha hit, it gives +9 to
wis/agi and 9 AC as well as +5 to sta, which helps in the higher end game
when you need as much AC as you can get and maintain wis.  For the Ranged
item, see about doing the Shawl quest in Thurgadin once you get into your
mid thirties.
