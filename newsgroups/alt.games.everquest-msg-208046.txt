Well, more Wisdom/mana is better for mana pool than HPs/STA.  The reason 
the HPs are really useful is that they double as a way to stay alive a 
bit longer while being smacked after you slow, in addition to providing a 
means of digging up some extra mana.  Of course, having an SK as the MA 
generally solves that problem anyway.
