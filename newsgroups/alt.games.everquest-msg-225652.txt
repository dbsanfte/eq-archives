    Add myself and about a quarter of the 180 characters in my guild to that
list. Seems to hit people that have been online for a good deal of time - I
usually get it when I've left the trader on overnight. When I go to switch
over to another character, I'll crash either at character select or when
next looking in a vendor's inventory. Very annoying, but it only happens the
once so /shrug.

    Players rarely know what's going to be fixed unless they all complain
anyways, and sometimes not even then. I've just assumed they'll have it
debugged by next patch, and soldier on. If it isn't, then I'll get vocal
about it in forums that the devs read. The only things that should be rushed
are persistent crash bugs, exploits, and the like, not a
one-time-if-you've-been-on-forever bug.
