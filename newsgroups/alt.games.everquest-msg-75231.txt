My advice is: don't stress about it. Just make sure you get enough
cash to buy your spells. Once you hit level 34 and can offer some
decent port options, you will be rolling in money. My wizard can
easily make 1000+ plat a day by porting people. That's better money,
and easier, than arguing over the chump change dropped by random mobs.
