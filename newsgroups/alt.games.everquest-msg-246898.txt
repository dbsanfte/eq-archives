While I do prefer to pay by debit card (Personal philosophy: 'Consumer' type
credit = bad), I have personal objections to going through paypal. The
contract agreement reads very much like: We reserve the right to screw you
over at our choice, without telling you about it, and you can only contest
it in arbitration in our home state, several hundred miles from yours, so
nyaa nyaa.

I will not pay, in advance, by check or money order. For check or money
order (preferably check) my 'most favorable to artist' leaning would be:
Small fee in advance (5-15% depending on how much it is?).
I see sketches, approve sketches.
Partial payment
Artist does final. Sends me postage stamp sized versions of final.
I pay rest of payment, artist sends me final version.
Everyone happy, if a bit complicated.
This is in fact how I've done website design in the past. (Usually though, I
bill at the end, but I am dealing with companies, not individuals)
Small retainer
generate basic layout
get half pay
Do final site with all content entered
Get paid the rest.
I almost paid this year to have my FF character done by a guy at an anime
con 2 weeks ago... he was doing 'anything you want' line art + some color
commissions right there at his table. (Watched him draw 4 different anime
chars all drunk-looking leaning on each other in 35 min... very very good
drawings. On a white T-shirt. Man is amazing. ) My printed out screenshots
got wet though.

Tough really, I've never had the personal vanity to want to pay $50 and up
for the (admittedly very nice) character portraits some people have made,
and then wait 6 months. My character won't look like that in 6 months
anyway. I did see one guy who had a 1 month and it's done, or half price
guarantee. He only charged $300 a portrait. O_O.

My suggestion: Take credit cards, but go with something other than paypal.
Paypal is easy. Paypal is convenient. Paypal also dangerous to buyer and
seller alike... though it apparently has gotten better since ebay bought it.
Talk to your bank about a low use merchant account. Something with a web
based interface so you don't have to buy a Point of Sale terminal.
Since you are generally dealing with reasonably small charges (I would
assume), the % per charge may likely be less than paypal's per transaction
charges (I'm not real sure. I've never sold through paypal, only paid for
some ebay stuff...)
