    If you're a healer and the first heal doesn't tell you visually how many
HPs the target has roughly, ask. My rogue recently told a cleric that joined
our group "500 HPs per bub, 400 once my Symbol drops" (I was puller, and
frequently had damage when I got back to the group). He now knew exactly how
fragile I was, when to drop a Cel Heal, everything. If he wanted to know
everyone else, just ask.
