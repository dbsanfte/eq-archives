You need the stone to go from camp to camp. I.E., if you want to go to the
Butcherblock camp, and you are in East Commons, you ask for transportation
from the Magus. He/She won't talk to you unless you have the stone.

Besides, getting the stone is easy. Start by going to your home town. You
will get a message. Go to where the message tells you. You will have a
lengthly conversation with that individuals.

Now go to one of the camps. You need to talk to one individual--in East
Commons, it's Bastre Songweaver. Hail him and bring up your jounal window.
He will ask you some questions. Find the recorded answers in your journal.
When you are successful, you will get the Adventurer's Stone.

After your first successful adventure, get a 6 point charm with stats. Put
the stone in the charm. Now it doesn't take up any space in your bags.
