   If ever you happen to be in the bank in Freeport, and you
happen to see that the door in the back, the one that is 
always locked, just happens to be open, listen to that 
nagging little voice in the back of your mind telling you 
that maybe you shouldn't run in and explore.  Especially if
you are play a character that can't gate.  Because if you don't,
that damned door will shut the second after you run in, and 
it will be locked from the other side as well, and you'll
be stuck in there with no one but some guard (and what the 
hell did he _do_ to get solitary confinement, anyways?!?).
It's just a small room, about the size of a bathroom, and
not very interesting at all.

   Annie  <--- Still can't believe that she had to petition
               for help to escape from the bank in Freeport.
