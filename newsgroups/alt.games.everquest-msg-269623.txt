This is not related to online selling, but...

I play EQ not EQ2, but I have noticed the unpleasant development
(roughly since EQ2 launched) of a data packet logjam that lasts just
long enough for me to get the "You have been disconnected" message then
the logjam resolves itself and the backed up data packets flow. This
has had the apparently unfortunately effect of getting my character
(two different characters on separate occasions) killed. I normally
will end up at the login screen with an error message (timeout).

This apparent logjam might be a result of my ISP, network congestion,
or something at SOE's end, but it may happen one to four times or more
a night (but not every night).

I have been wondering about that. Come to think of it, I notice that my
friend who often puts up a trader in the bazaar when he camps for the
night seems to disappear at the oddest times and HE is on dsl or cable
in an entirely different part of the country.
