Well, my own favorite spot for level 10 is no more -- the pyramids
outside Cazic-Thule. Before the recent changes, these used to have 
level 7-11 lizardmen one per pyramid along with a couple of wanderers 
in the area. It was a great spot especially for evils who can 
sell/bank in Oggok.

The grizzly bears in Rathe Mtns might be an option. Not likely to
be crowded, convenient to Oggok, and you might score a HQ bear pelt
or two.
