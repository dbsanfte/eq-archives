I primarily play on Prexus.

My problems in Stonebrunt were entirely my own - I was playing in a
brightly lit room, so my screen was hard to see, I was expecting the
zone to be lower level and less aggro than it was, and I wasn't
careful about watching my buffs around potentially hostile camps. And,
of course, I was jut rambling around with no clue where I was :)

I'll revisit the zone soon, when I find some free time to play
seriously again.

Thanks for the offer though, much appreciated!
