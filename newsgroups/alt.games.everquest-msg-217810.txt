I have a question in reference to PoP keys and flags. To my understading you
need to be flagged to get into a zone if you have not met the level req. But
when you meet the lvl req you can get automatically get in? Then keys you
have to obtain the items and turn them in to get the key for the zone. Then
I also want to know what this elemental thing is and how u get it. I have a
56 druid and I want to be able to get into; BoT, VT and HoH eventually so I
want to know what I have to do to get ready for these zones. I just feel
kinda silly asking people these questions in game because most people treat
you like some kinda of retarded noob. So any info you give me is much
appreciated ty : )
