A group of friends and I got together to start a guild.  Yeah, I know it's a
little late considering EQ2, but we have some ideas and put them together to
form a guild.  So, last Saturday, Dec 2nd, we form the guild in chat yadda
yadda yadda.  Despite being the *only* guild in that list for the entire
week it wasn't until the 10th that I got the letter.  Understandable.  One
person's job is to go through them on Monday's or Sunday nights and send out
the emails.  So Monday, I am logged on for 10 hours.  Tuesday, I am on for 3
plus hours and on Wed another 3 plus hours.  I gave them the benefit of the
doubt and said 15+ hours.  On Wed, we finally saw a GM, but she logged
before coming to our assistance, even though I have had a petition in every
single time I have been online, go as far as having a short conversation
with a Sr. Guide, who is damn near the best Guide on Povar.

I am kinda annoyed.  I have been more than patient.  My request takes 5
minutes tops, and that's if the GM has to read directions as they do it, I
just couldn't see how it could take more than 15 hours online to get a Guild
started.

So this morning, I get pissed.  Really pissed and write what is probably one
of my best complaint letters yet.  I also BCC to some vice presidents at
both Sony and Verant (Internet research and the phone is such a wonderful
tool).  When I log on this evening, I have a guild tag.  When I logged last
night I was anon and when I logged on tonight I had on /role.  Is it
possible for a GM to log you in and create your guild?  Just curious and not
sure that a follow-up letter would be wise considering that from one email
response I got back, someone's ass was being chewed on.

Anyone ever hear of this happening before?  Or something similar?
