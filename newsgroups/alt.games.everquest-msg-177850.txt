    Considering how bad last expansion was, this one has been pretty tame.
Remember the patch when Bane and mod damage became cumulative, so rogues
could backstab for 32 K? The patch where ranged weapons lost their delay,
and could be used as often as you could click "ranged attack"? Or when
throwing weapons could be used as bow ammo, leading to some insane Deadly
Strikes from rogues? When you could equip any item in any slot, crash any
zone, dupe items and do No Drop trades? As odd as it seems, I think they're
getting better!
