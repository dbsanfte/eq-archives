Greetings,

I very much appreciate the recent changes to the Hotbutton window. The
ability to save unlimited sets of 4 bars, each with 10 pages of 10
buttons, is very nice.

But how do you get the same functionality out of the Actions window?  

Because the way I've got things set up, my macros don't always work
when I switch Hotbuton sets and abilities for monster missions.

The MM ability slot numbers (1-10) don't match up with my main's
ability numbers, and BOOM...I have to right-click the ability buttons
and assign abilities before things are working again.

Any helpful ideas would be very greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

Tim ==
