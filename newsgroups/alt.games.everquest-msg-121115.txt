Look for a program called EQW.  It makes EQ run in a window.  Verant
occasionally likes to make changes to break this, but the EQW developers
fairly quickly fix things.

As to why these games don't work that way without a hack like EQW...it is
because Verant thinks that not being able to run in a window makes it harder
to cheat.
