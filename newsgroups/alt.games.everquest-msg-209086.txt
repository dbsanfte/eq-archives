Charm boars.  The rest can either be rooted or mezzed (typically)

The best piece of advice really is to say Rallos is NOT the priority in this
event - you should have at least as many people on "add duty" as the number
engaged with RZ (if not many more)

His melee is weak by PoP standards, his AE (dot/mana drain) is easily
resistable (and just as easily cured), and his AE rampage (easily avoidable
if you keep max range) occurs as infrequently as 1-2 times a fight (I
personally have ever seen him ramp more than 5 times in a fight)

Have add groups in position before/as RZ is engaged (before any adds spawn),
make sure they are well balanced groups for the task at hand.

Once RZ is dead (in a corner) you have 2 options (depends how the situation
looks), you either start assisting and killing the nicely-CC'd mobs (laf),
or you just evac/die, and run back for the Planar Projection Hail.

The horde of adds will sit on RZ's body, the planar projection pops in the
centre of the arena, WELL away from their agro range.  You can invis and
levi from the zonein, and land pretty much on the PP without a single mobs
agro on you.

Killing "corpses" now nolonger prevents mobs from popping, and many mobs are
too fast to kite (indoor zone, no selos), just keep them contained while RZ
dies.

He doesn't have huge HP, a warrior, 5 clerics, bard, shaman and handful of
non-kiting classes (monk/rogue/mage) can drop RZ in a fairly fast time.
Just keep the add-CCing in the opposite corners, well away from RZ.

Alternatively, you can just all out burn his ass and zerg him dead, downing
him before the add's tear your raid a new asshole!
