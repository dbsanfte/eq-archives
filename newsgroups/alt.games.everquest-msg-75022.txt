Firstly, it might help if you said what zone you got transported to. Perhaps
theres an easy way back you havnt considered. ie if youre in tox you can get
back via nexus.
Secondly, you can only be bound at cities (by others), so I dont understand
this business about lasting .001 seconds. About the only city i can think of
like that is highpass, and you cant port to there, unless youre off in
velious or kunark somewhere?
Thirdly, you wont get much help unless you say what server youre on. Id help
you, but I doubt ill be following up on this thread.
