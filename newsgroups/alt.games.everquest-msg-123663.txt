It has sort of happened on E'ci, that I am aware of.

Two guilds were having a dispute over a ragefire that had not yet popped.
During the course of this, one of the guilds (or both) petitioned.  I'm not
sure who answered the call, whether it was a guide, or a wandering GM from
another server.  (I heard visiting GM, but without being there I'm not willing
to state that as a certainty).   The "resolution" from the GM was the one
stated by the original poster.   The guilds were asked to roll, with the
winner receiving the right to kill Ragefire when he popped, with the other
guild having second chance.

Resolution is in quotes there, since it is not the end of the story.   When GM
Grog, E'ci's offical lead GM at the time, heard of it, he completely reversed
the decision, stating that Ragefire would be a race, as it had been, and he
was not going to start dictating the spawns.  From the people involved, it was
probably a few hours after the original decision had come down.
