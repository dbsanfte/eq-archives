It's really not as tricky as it sounds.  When you enter the "fence" surrounding
the rygorr fort stay VERY close to the inside of the fence.  If you try running
through the middle you will aggro the elites and oracle inside the main
building, even though they can't see you.  Very bad.  Very bad. 
Click the gate to the jail to open the door, then click the orb to zone in. 
There is no orb to zone back out, just run back the way you came.
There is usually one miner as you head down the first trail.  Next is a cavern
with 2 watchmen, and the big "well" will be on your right.  They are harder. 
There are a few wanderers, but not a bunch "up top".  My ranger spent many
levels doing just the miners / watchmen at the zone-in area and the "top" main
trail.
I have no idea what tactics a bard would use in here, but it's one of my
favorite zones.
