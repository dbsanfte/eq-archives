Adding to everyone else's posts....

The only way I know to increase your faction with the gnomes in SolA
(Solusek's Eye) are by fighting in SolB (Nagafen's Lair)...specifically,
faction with the kobolds there.

SolB is a minimum level 30 zone...however, if your iksar is a monk or necro
you might be able to go in much earlier (min 18 for monk...I think 12 for
necro...though I DO NOT recommend going in before 20) and hang out near
other people killing kobolds.  Just ask them if they mind if you take a
swing at their kobolds for faction...I seriously doubt if they'd mind.  If
you get hit you can always FD.  Make sure you get back up & hit them before
they die, though, or else you won't get the faction.

I would assume...hmmm...maybe a minimum of 300 faction messages before
you're high enough to buy the boots (more than likely 500+ but hell, it
could be less than 300).  Keep in mind that being apprehensive means a price
of probably nearly 6000.  Your CHA is probably rather low so if you can find
a friendly enchanter or shaman willing to give you a CHA buff that'll help
SOME, but that does NOT affect faction...just final price.
