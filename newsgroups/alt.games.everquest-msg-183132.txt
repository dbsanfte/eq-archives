You tell them.  Where do folks get off thinking that freedom of choice 
is a good thing?  Remember them crazy days when web developers had to 
worry about their site being built to universal standards?  All web

  All programs should require microsoft operating systems.  In this new 
age of technology there is room for but one and all will embrace it or 
be winnowed like chaff from the wheat.
