OK, I have played rangers since I started AD&D back in 81. I love them and
can do a good job playing them but now I am a little perplexed.  I have now
started a Beastlord that has made 11th on Firiona Vie and am having troubles
controlling my pup, /pet attack  is easy enough, but can anyone give me some
more ideas on commands that make pulling easier? Seems I make the lil guy
sit and when I am halfway back to the group with a mammoth calf he comes
bounding out to attack. Then the group has to run out near where all the
mobs are passing through and it puts everyone in danger. I try not to pull
because of this but sometimes I have to.
Thanks all,
Yowen, 11th season Barbarian Beastlord on FV
