Does this spell do anything when I cast it?  I have had this
spell cast on me a couple of times and the world turns
completely black!  I could not see anything at all let alone
tell what direction I was facing or if my opponnent had
moved or not until it wore off.  But when ever I cast this
on any of my intended victems they turm and head right for
me!!??  Never do they go the wrong way and never does it
slow their ability to attack at all.  The spell does "take"
way more often than it fails but either way the results are
the same, the MoB comes directly after me and attacks in
exactly the same manner and amount of times either way.  Has
anybody else noticed this?  Thanks in advance for all
replies.
