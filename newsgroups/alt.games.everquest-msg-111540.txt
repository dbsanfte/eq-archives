This is me.  It's part of my standard spell load out.  Starfire,
Lightning Blast, Drifting Death, Breath of Ro, Ensnare, Engulfing
Roots, Thorncoat/SLN/Some Buff/TP, SoW/Wolfie.  All I need for
soloing.  It changes for grouping/raids depending on which role I'm
playing.

I've had yet, at 52, to not be able to get a root off even while being
beat on by multiple mobs.
