Obviously, I've snipped a bit of the all zeros. There was even a little bit
at level one where we were a three person level 1 group.

That's 5 kills for level 1, 15 for level 2, and 45 for level 3. Grouped!

I did notice my skills in general suffered from the rapid rise:
1hs got as far as 13, Offense to 19, but Defense was 1, bind wounds was 1,
sense heading was 1, and taunt got as high as 6. I did not train any points
in anything- although I did hand in my note. Garret the SK gnome trainer is
at loc pos 2144, neg 433.

I got a little giddy about how undestructable I was. Normally, I stick with
blues after level 2, and slowly level, because I usually play casters so
dying really stinks (re-mem spells). But with this character, I was
attacking yellows at half health for the fun of it. And whenever Harm Touch
was down, I'd deliberately get myself killed to recycle it.
