Actually, My Dodge skill is capped, but my Defense skill was 88 (at
level 31). I'm pretty good at avoiding agro and still doing my job. I
rarely get agro unless it's from a pop or add while I'm medding. (And
I never try to get Agro by doing the same thing twice, more than can
be said for a few Wizards I grouped with in the past, may their souls
rest in peace.) Partly because I'm rather careful about when I Heal,
DoT, and Nuke, and also partly because I've been grouped with some
really excellent groups, full of people that know what they are
supposed to be doing, at least most of them. A big change from the
last time I played (nearly 2 years ago).

An example was last Saturday, grouped in the Overthere for about 4
hours or so I think, with the members changing every so often. Chain
pulling Mobs red to me (and yellow or even to most everyone else). A
Monk was our main tank for most of the time, I was Main Healer for the
entire time, and the backup healer, spent his mana healing me (from
Canni-Dancing) or Nuking and DoTing. Didn't go OOM once, didn't gain
agro once, gained 2 and 1/2 levels. No one died. A great group of
about 12 members for varying lengths of time.

However as for my skill-ups, I went to High Keep, I died once, and I'm
pretty sure trained a group. (Caused a death I think, but some people
said that it was their puller that pulled too many when they needed to
med, so I'm not sure. I'm pretty sure I agroed 2 blues accidentally,
but shortly thereafter 4 more showed up.) Anyway, after apologizing to
them and everyone else, I spent about 3 hours there buffing and
healing the groups as my penance. I made 6, count 'em 6, Piercing
skillups. I seemed to get them faster on the blue mobs, if only
because I hit them more often. I was hitting about once in 5 to 10
tryï¿½s on the blues, and once in about 15 to 20 on the yellows. My
offense went up by about 10. My defense however went up by about 25,
because I was taking a pretty serious beating from many of the blues
that popped around me.

I guess I just have to keep at it.
