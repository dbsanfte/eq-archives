I've been playing since shortly after launch, until right now, and I
have *never* observed this behaviour.  Recently a guildmate noticed a
bot and managed to KS it consistently by tagging the next mob the bot
was going to kill, letting the bot kill the mob, and looting the last
mob while the bot was killing.  Pretty clear this wouldn't have worked
if DPS had *anything* to do with who go the kill.

I wouldn't be surprised if what you saw was just due to lag: you
thought you tagged it first, but in fact someone else hit it.
Particularly in the jungles of STV it would be easy for this to
happen.
