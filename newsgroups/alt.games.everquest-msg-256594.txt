Nope, I can confirm that spellcasting skills can increase from 0
through use.  When I created my wizard, I sent him straight into
the tutorial, where:

[03:16:12] You begin casting Shock of Frost.
[03:16:13] Wizbeau hit a small rat for 5 points of non-melee damage.
[03:16:13] A small rat's skin freezes.
[03:16:13] You have become better at Evocation! (1)
[03:16:13] You have become better at Channeling! (1)

Regarding a claim elsewhere in this thread, I checked my weapon skillups
and indeed, they all seem to happen on successful hits.  (In tradeskills,
you can definitely skillup on a failure, though there's some anecdotal
evidence that skillups are *more likely* on a success.)

Similarly, all my skillups on Offense came with successful hits, and
all my skillups on Defense came when mobs missed me.

Given that, as a caster, my weapon skills suck (and have low caps, too),
it's no wonder they're hard to improve: I have trouble hitting, and
trouble avoiding being hit.  If I ever decide I actually care about
my wizard's weapon skills I'll have to find some ATK/DEX buffs if I
want to have any chance of real improvement.
