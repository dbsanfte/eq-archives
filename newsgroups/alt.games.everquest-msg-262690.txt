<interesting plan snipped for brevity>

The problem that SOE will run in to should they try to implement a plan is
that they (or rather VI) didn't consider the possibility from the jump.  One
of the stones the entire economy (such as it is) is built around is not
being able to do just that .. to buy equipmemt.  Which may be why there's
such a market for plat as well as gear.

What they'd probably do it Microsoft it ... let someone else (in this case
IGE) perfect it, then buy that process from them.

Which, as I think of it, is a RL example of something remarkably similar to
what we're discussing.
