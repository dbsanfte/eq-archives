<snip awesome cleric story>

congrats...love to see a great cleric or
enchanter at work (two classes IMHO
that can _really_ shine, like keeping
a billion mobs mezed/stunned/rooted
and saving my butt from a train).

> Monual.  I can play.  :)

Dammit, 3 years and the best
stories I can come up with are
"This one time, my rogue stabbed
some stuff a LOT and it died."

People don't want to hear about
corpse skulks through a mix
of see-invis/no see-invis mobs,
they just want to know if you have
their body back yet ("Yes, out of
41 people your corpse is at the
zone in the Hole...")
;-)
