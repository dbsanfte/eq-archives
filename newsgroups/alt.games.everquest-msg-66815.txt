Make that: level to 59, 'level to 51' (as in level 50 to 51) 6 times +
12 times + 5 times, get an uber horse. 23 times level 50 is roughly
the same as 5 times level 54. And you get a better horse than the one
people pay more than 100k plat for. Did you really expect to be handed
a pony on a silver platter just for playing a paladin?

If you want unfair, try spending that much exp as a cleric in order to
completely rez somone once every three *real life* days played.
