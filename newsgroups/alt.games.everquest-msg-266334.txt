Without even looking back I bet I can come up with those five names.

Let... me... see....

Madbomma... okay that one was too easy, nor do I think he would hide
Freek... who has resurfaced lately, but the IPs don't match
il128... maybe
Taras Bulba... not his style, nor does he have the brains to fake it
Drake... maybe, he's been gone a very long time though

I thought of adding Dan Day but somehow I doubt he would forget his
own name.
