I made a mead myself a few times. I am not a great brewer, mostly I
brewed in college when I was an SCA member. I am also not pagan, I am
a pretty boring Catholic fundimentalist nutcase.

Hence my interest in meads (being a fan of the good ol days). I did a
lot of meads, with teas, herbs, different fruits added and such. I did
a few wines, one was a wine with cranberries, with added herbs, which
made it not really a wine but it was tasty, and the ladies liked it.
At the time that was my primary consideration.

A few months ago I decided to start brewing again. I deconstructed
mead. In college to brew, I bought the mixes, the stabalizers and
yeasts, with all the junk. I lost it all long ago. I figured it was
costly, but, I liked doing it.

I bought one stopper, a S tube, a pound and a half of Honey, a gallon
of Z-hills (spring) water, and a packet of Fleishmann's yeast (cheap
kind at U-Save). I boiled the honey into the water, added yeast to the
empty bottle, cooled the must (I guess it was, must is really raw
beer!), poured it in, corked it with the S tube and swirled it every
day. When the bubbles faded I had mead. I have dont it a few times
with little variation to the recipe (more or less honey).

I bottle it with a syphon, and I still keep a few bottles. I don't
drink it much but at last sampling it is aging nicely. Gotta make
another batch before too long.

The problem is it has too many carbs for my diet, but when I reach my
target weight I have a great way to cheat!
