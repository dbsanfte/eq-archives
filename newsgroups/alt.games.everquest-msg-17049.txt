If you cannot dedicate a minimum of an hour or more of actual play time to a
session, your progress will be slow. This could mean two hours total, taking
into consideration the time to find a decent group, a hunting spot, etc., or
a mere hour if you have a preorganized group.

In general, two hours or so for the casual gamer is ideal. The game rewards
longer sessions because, quite simply, it often takes a while to get the
ball rolling, so to speak. Once a decent group is firing on all cylinders,
your progress will be good.

If you know you will not be playing for a longer period of time, it is often
easier to play solo for a while because you can cut to the chase and get
right to playing. This assumes you know how to solo effectively with your
class, of course, and that you have a class that can be effectively soloed
in the first place.
