Actually, it was fun. I ended up playing quite a bit in Crushbone with my 
barbarian shaman who got there by hoofing it the whole way.  I died twice 
my first time trying to make that run.

It's not a choice now, with those things available, you would never get 
any groups if you told people to wait an hour for you.  You had to 
actually plan ahead for where you wanted to be, and there were always 
plenty of people in the popular zones for that exact reason.

EQ did not used to be very friendly to the casual player, no question 
about that, but, that is a lot of what I liked about it.

There are several MMORPGs out there right now that are very casual player 
friendly, EQ did not used to be one of them.
