Sure, always good to miss one type of bug in favour of another. This is 
the perfect beta strategy for missing the likes of this little gem:

Assume you need to a point of skill before it starts skilling up; and 
that there is a tradeskill you must be 25th level to start, but recall 
that you can't train tradeskills at a guildmaster past 20... but your 
first point in the skill will bump you to your current level (at least 
25)... so you can't train it at all.

That's never happened. NooooOOOOoooo. Never ;)
