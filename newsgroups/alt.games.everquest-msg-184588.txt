In the interest of finding out about the bazaar crash-to-desktop problem, I 
set a trader up over an hour ago and went AFK. While doing this I put my 
corless phone antenna on the -> key, so my trader is spinning in place. An 
hour plus has elapsed and I have yet to crash.

Who else wants to bet that "bug" is a way for Sony to drop a bit of their 
bandwidth bill?
