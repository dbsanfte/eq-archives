Find a group of much higher level beating on higher level mobs. Politely ask
them is they would not mind you shooting arrows into their mob from a short
distance (ungrouped with them, of course) while they fight because you'd
like to up your archery skill. Most groups will be happy to get the extra
damage without giving away exp, loot or risking a KS, and you'll happily
boost your skill with little to no risk involved. Once you get archery up to
the 60s or 70s, it will go up pretty quickly on its own.
