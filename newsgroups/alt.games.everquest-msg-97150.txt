I'm not really sure what Dan said in the top paragraph that makes it look
like he could be the "perp".  I also believe it's not a scam, so now I'm
probably the one running the site.

Funny thing about credit cards -- a fraudulent merchant can get hit hard if
he pulls his fraud with them.  But if he were to accept the credit card info
and then abandon the site, he could use the credit card info as a consumer,
and could get away with it pretty easily for a time (especially if he only
made one purchase with each stolen credit card number).  His only worry
would be that someone link all of those stolen credit cards back to his
site.  Then if he had taken care that the site could not be traced back to
him personally (set up from an internet cafe not near his house using fake
personal info, etc.) he should be relatively safe from being caught.
Anyway, my point is, if the site wanted credit card info, that would be
suspicious; it doesn't, and somehow people say that that is more suspicious.
Doesn't make too much sense.

All that having been said, though, there is an old saying, "You can't cheat
an honest person."  Although it's not entirely true, it would be in this
case.  If this site is a scam (and to be honest I hope it is), then the only
people who will be hurt by it are the e-bay types anyway.
