actually, what I failed to mention is the fact that I had a higher level
friend I asked to help me WAITING BEHIND THE TENT.  I didn't actually train
to the fucking DOCKS... I'm not that much of a moron.
And yes, I've learned in the past 2.5 years of playing that a lvl 13
enchanter can't kill a giant.  heh.

now if you'll excuse me, I have children to tend to.
