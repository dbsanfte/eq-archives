The first is marginally right, the second is totally wrong.
STR the primary attribute for creating a warrior?  Sure right...

You want to dump all the starting points somewhere?  Try STA.

As a warrior, which is the *EASIEST* stat to raise through equipment?
Now which is the hardest?

Primal weapons from ST proc Avatar.  What "melee" stats does Avatar
add?  What "melee" stat does Avatar NOT add?

Strength is stupidly easy to raise as a warrior.  Practically
everything you pick up and equip gives strength bonuses.  But man, to
get STA, it's just painful.  Even that stupid Katana of Pain makes it
a hard choice to raise STA given that the sword has -10 vs all
resists.

AC/hps for general purpose warrior.  Resists for when you start going
up against ToV mobs.
