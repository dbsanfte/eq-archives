Due primarily to the almost rabid efforts of a friend of mine, I now
have both Xanthe's Earring of Nature and the Earring of the Solstice.
My friend decided he wanted the Solstice earring, one for each of his
two main characters, and that if you're going to get together
ingredients for two, you may as well get enough for four.

So, I helped a little with the work, but only a very little, and I
picked up half the tab. Total cost, including failures, was about 3000
plat per earring - cheap.

And the best part... they match!
