No. Please no.  I thought the first poster was joking. A sick joke, but a
joke nonetheless.  But if someone else read it, then it isn't a joke.

That's indeed the end of it right there.  I would never play a game that
did this, and it's possible I would never play any game by such a company,
even if a particular game didn't implement (if, say, EQ-L had it but not
EQ2).

Sony, you idiots...
