"Warning labels are exactly what Jack Thompson, a Miami attorney and
vocal critic of the entertainment industry, wants to result from a
lawsuit he plans to file against Sony Online Entertainment for Elizabeth
Woolley.

"We're trying to whack them with a verdict significantly large so that
they, out of fiscal self-interest, will put warning labels on," he said.
"We're trying to get them to act responsibly. They know this is an
addictive game."

This is generally the "rationale" that lawyers use to explain why they
are suing the evil company that didn't tell you the chainsaw would
injure you if you tried to stop the blade with your dick.

"Well, obviously we wouldn't be asking for any money if we could get
them to put a warning label on it voluntarily. Of course we don't want
any money. This isn't about money. It's about the safety of the PEOPLE,
Damnit! But since' it's the only way to do it, you can make that check
payable to our lawfirm and we'll make sure the plaintiff gets something
for her trouble."
