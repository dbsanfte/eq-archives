This is false, unless perhaps you are on a Zek server,
"environment" deaths like falling off a cliff, drowning, being
killed by lava, and the mysterious "pain and suffering" all do
indeed cost you just as much exp as death from being killed by a
mob.  THe only deaths that don't are those caused by other
players, and even a few of those can cause exp loss (pets, DOTs,
stunning you so you fall off a cliff...)
