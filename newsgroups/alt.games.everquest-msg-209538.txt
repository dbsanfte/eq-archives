I have a Tolan's but I only equip it to make arrows...15 second delay is a
killer...(working on EQ!).
Tzen has two Silver Chitin Wristbands (4-5K on The Seventh Hammer), as well
as Crystal Chitin Gaunts.
He also has two Valorium Rings of Gallantry here's my Magelo (to save me
more typing hehe) : http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=221979

Decent enough...not uber, but I'm happy enough atm.

<hijack> If anyone has any suggestions for Tzen, reply in this thread too :)
