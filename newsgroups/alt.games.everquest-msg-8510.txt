True indeed... but I should point out... that was my very first character
and discovered that on my own. A friend suggested I move to Misty Thicket
and hang out at the wall and then I jumped into the water out of
curiousity... and that was that. It was kind of cool to discover that, I had
a blast. When I told my friend about it, he knew nothing of it. So now, If I
want to level fast, I start out there.
