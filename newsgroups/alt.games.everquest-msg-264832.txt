As much as I enjoyed my time in this game (primarily because of the guild 
that I founded and the good friends I made there), I have to admit this is 
true. I was shocked at how few choices we had for hunting, for example. 
Barrows was the *only* Albion dungeon in the game for the high-end (30-50) 
at launch and by the time we reached it, it was still completely unitemized. 
Worse, when they went about itemizing all the dungeons, they did them 
*consecutively* rather than simultaneously, so that for a period of time 
(don't recall now, I think a few weeks) Midgard was the only realm with high 
end gear, followed by Albion, followed by Hibernia. This, in a PvP game! I 
don't have to tell you how that went over at the time ...
