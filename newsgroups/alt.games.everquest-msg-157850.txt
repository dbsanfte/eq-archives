    I think he's making a case for the "sunshine player", the one that only
shows up to raids where stuff he wants drops and fully expects to get that
stuff. Hopefully he sees how that won't advance the guild as a whole. "Why
are there no clerics here?" "Oh, no cleric loot drops here." "Guess we can
never kill this, then."

    Now in all fairness, there can be cronyism in any officer-award system.
We can't be sure that the wizard he complained about HAS contributed in the
past. But if there is cronyism, usually the other guildmembers also get
upset and leave.

    To explain it better: imagine the awards were run on points, where the
more you raid the more points you get to bid on stuff. Do you think that on
your first raid, you'd be able to outbid ANYONE there? In a properly run
officer award system, the awards will be very similar to a points award
system. So you still wouldn't have a chance at loot. You play for future
consideration - you'd don't /random for raid loot!

    So you've made a case for doing AoW. Now what about those other mobs you
named? ;-)

    Melees always overestimate the importance of getting drops, since they
live and die based on gear. Casters usually underestimate the importance of
drops, since gear (until recently) didn't do a whole lot for them. I think
you have to look at each mob case-by-case, decide what a "best drop" and
"worst drop" scenario would look like, and make decisions based on that.
It's a colossal waste of time if all a mob will give you is some minor
HP/resist upgrades on three people and an increase from 15/20 to 16/20
primary on one rogue, versus what those 50 people could accomplish in the
same few hours elsewhere.

    Some people don't do the math. ;-) Before we entered Vex Thal, I'd say
on average people were getting one item per month. After we got into Vex
Thal and had the zone to ourselves, this went up to one item per two weeks -
and they were all top-end items. If you put in the time, the payoff will
come.
