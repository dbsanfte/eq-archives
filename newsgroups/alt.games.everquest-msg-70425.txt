The party is almost fine. You can do Renux with a single party, but
your tank needs to be defensive disc capable and your necro 55+ to
minimize resists. Spawn her, send in the pets and the defensive tank
to get and hold aggro while your necro and/or druid/ranger land
snare/darkness.

For whatever reason, Renux will not attack pets. Once snare lands, she
can be aggro-kited while the pets beat her to death. Once fear hits,
throw every DoT and nuke you can on her while tanks and rogue follow
her around beating her to death. Make sure to chain snare so that it
doesn't wear off. If fear breaks, everyone needs to back off until it
lands again.
