Yep. 31 is a good time to consider leaving High Keep. (I left at 30 as I
recall.) The xp starts to dry up and you get tired of the same four mobs
all day.

At 31 I went to Paw. I have seen Pallies solo in there, though it's damn
tough and you need to pick your battles carefully. You might try that.

The overthere would, of course, work for you in a ledge group. Fast xp
but crap loot, boring as hell, and you won't learn anything. Crystal
Caverns would be a better bet, and you can probably find a group there.

I'm thinking you could also start soloing some of the blue con snow
cougars in Iceclad near the gnome igloos. If you're lucky you'll get in
on a pickup group for Tower of Frozen Shadows. (The first two floors are
great at your level in a good group. Loot's pretty good and the xp will
rock.)

There's some xp giving mobs in Najena you could go work over. That
dungeon could be a bit of a challenge at 31 solo, but it's great fun. I
solo'd 35 with my warrior in there on the Ghoulbane quest skeletons just
to prove to myself that I could do it. If you dont' already have your
GB, you could start the quest there as well.

Just a few ideas. Stay out of the boring old LoIO, OT, Dreadlands loop
if you can.
