No you won't make money fast - get used to being skint for a long time yet.

>i tryed for example the millers quest to make belts and sell them after

Why would anybody buy them from you when its such an easy/cheap quest to do
themselves.  Only run it to upgrade your own armour .Stick to killing things.
You're ready for blackburrow - go find a tank to hide behind. 

>  i gave them a wolf skin and some money and nothing happend

Check to make sure you're giving them the correct Quality pelt/amount of gold.
The Millers run 3 different quests each. You might have just got the different
quests mixed up .

Happy hunting!

Don't think of it as being outnumbered,
think of it as unlimited target selection.
