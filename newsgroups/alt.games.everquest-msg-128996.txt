Hmmmmmmmmm

Overlooking the fact that your response still didn't address the issue
I put forth, let's examine your response more closely...

Let's say you are a mother of three children in 1944 living in, oh

One evening a japanese person breaks into your house and murders you
and your three children in response to Manzinar....

Is such an act justified??
