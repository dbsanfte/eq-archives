Not enough to make a difference that is worth worrying about.

It's going to be better - warriors get a bonus on AC for every piece of 
kit they own - i.e. you wear a 10AC helm, warrior gets 12AC from the 
same piece of kit (I can't remember the exact percentage bonus).

Roughly the same, only if you get high enough that the warrior's skills 
go higher than your cap will their damage output go higher than yours.

However, Paladin DPS is often lowered due to spell casting.

Paladins hold aggro, Warriors beg for it.

Single group against most mobs - Paladin wins hands down.
