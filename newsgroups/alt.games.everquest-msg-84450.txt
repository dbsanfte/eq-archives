    Hard to quantify "best", though. For example, he designed Sleeper's Tomb
as the "endgame" zone in Velious - but it was farmable by a single group. He
originally had the zone on Dragon faction, hosing people who went CoV that
much more. And we won't get into how ready for prime time the zone was at
first. :-/ He had the coolest concepts, but they didn't always translate
well into the framework of how EQ is actually played.
