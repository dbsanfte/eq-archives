 Ok, well I'm going to stick to my theory. I know if I tag a casting mob
and start running I will normally get hit, which makes sense. Now, if I
turn the corner of a hall or something, the mob will not cast until he
runs and has LoS again. If that weren't the case you'd never be able to
pull casting mobs until they went OOM. 

 It's easy to test it. Take a trip to Dalnirs or something.

 Doesn't happen to me very often. I guess I'm just lucky that way.
