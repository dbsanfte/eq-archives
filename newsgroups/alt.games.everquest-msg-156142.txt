i thought at warriors were gonna get upgraded, but on vindi last night my
warrior got hit for 700 every time and i did not evade or dodge one hit.  it
wasnt just me either.  our ma went done in about 4 seconds and our sa
dropped in about 15 seconds and they were both warriors of course.  this is
a mob we have done many times with the same set up and this is the first
time we wiped.  go figure.
