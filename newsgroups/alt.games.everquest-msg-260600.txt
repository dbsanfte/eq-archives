The closest I could find for an NVidia card in the same price area was a 
GF FX5900-128MB for about $20 more than the ATi 9800 Pro-128MB.  The ATi 
outperforms the GF in most benchmarks by a decent margin, and, it's 
cheaper.  I've been a staunch NVidia supporter and buyer for some time 
too, the last 3 video cards I purchased prior to the 9800 were all NVidia 
based, and they were pretty much a no brainer purchase for the price vs 
performance at the time.  With the 9800 Pro having dropped down to the 
$150 range though, it was an easy choice to make.

If I were after the absolute top of the line video card now, I'm not sure 
which I'd choose between the latest ATi and NVidia ones, but, they are 
way too pricey at this point to be worth considering for me.
