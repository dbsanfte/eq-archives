And here is the crux of the problem.  Africans in general and Nigerians in
particular have no true grasp on the American umwelt, and are utterly
incapable of learning same.  Totally different head, y'know?  Coming, as
they do, from their diseased mud hut villages in the jungle or out on the
savannah, spending their lives being shot at by every revolutionary group
that happened to roam through, stealing with both hands as a survival
strategy, and being raised by a culture where fraud, deceit, and violence
are a way of life, he was totally incapable of dealing with an American
institution of higher education without eventually shooting someone.  If he
truly grasped our lifestyle, he'd have marched into the Dean's office and
informed him that:

(a)  He could barely speak pigeon English;
(b)  He was far and away too stupid to get a grasp on anything being
taught;
(c)   It didn't appear that he would ever be capable of performing any
useful function in American society whatsoever;
(d)  He was a Negro who'd been kept down my whitey for (pick a number)
hundred years;
(e)  He'd been in contact with the Affirmative Action division of the ACLU,
Al Sharpton, and the Society of Guilty White Liberals, and;
(f)  Busloads of welfare recipients were on the way to picket the school.

Hell, he'd have walked out within a half-hour with a law degree with
honors.  But, instead, he resorted to HIS inborn method of persuasion
(e.g., get a gun and kill them all).   (sniff)  Poor little pecker never
had a chance.  None of it is HIS fault, of course.  My vote is to give him
the degree he's worked so hard for and send him back to Nigeria with a
large monthly stipend for life, so the world can stand amazed at how
cultured and tolerant we are.

Yup.  Most do.

Standing in a university when one decides to start shooting the place up
wouldn't have anything to do with hitting a bunch of academics, I suppose.

>Just an unlucky student
>gone sour.  

Yup.  All our fault, too.  If he's got a brain in his head he'll recruit
the "Free Mumia" crowd to turn him into an international cause.  With a
little luck, he too can be declared an honorary citizen of Paris.

>As for his religion -- well, unfortunately, only  his
>family can answer that.

Possibly.  Since he's not an AMERICAN negro, odds are fair to passable that
he's got some kind of actual family structure that could answer a question
or two.
