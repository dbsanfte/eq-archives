Just an FYI, if you died due to going LD, you will not get any help to speak
of from Guides/GMs.  Dying due to LD is not something they consider to be
their problem.  Mind you, they should still respond to your petition, if
only to tell you that.  Do you play at odd hours?  The only time I've had a
problem with response time on petitions is very late at night Pacific time.

No, I don't know his email address, and, even if I did, and you wrote to
him, he would likely not be the person reading the email anyway, that's what
executive assistants are for.
