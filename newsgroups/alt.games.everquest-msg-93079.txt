No, it isn't normally the same, since the mob is usually almost dead
and it only takes you a few seconds to finish it off for the person
who yelled.  And my casters in turn don't charge for something (like
SoW, for example) for which it only takes a second or two to recoup
the mana.

But suppose you're a warrior and someone yells for help, and the mob
takes you down to half your hit points.  You're now looking at 5
minutes sitting on your butt.  If the person you saved scampers off
without a word or even just a perfunctory "thx," don't you get a bit
miffed?  Maybe you don't, but then again, maybe as a tank you're not
_constantly_ in that situation, the way an unanon cleric is.  The
first few times you might not mind so much, but it's the sort of thing
that gets old fast.

If a warrior saved my butt and got down to half his health as a
result, you can bet your booties I'd be healing him if I could and
thanking him profusely or even <gasp> offering him money.
