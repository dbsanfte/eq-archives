"Last week was the final slap in the face for my level 42 necromancer and my
55 cleric . I have been playing EQ for 2 years and now its time to say
goodbye ;( I have put up with a lot of things but when the GM made me share
the orc camp with those gimp n00bs it convinced me that my $10 a month is
better spent on a case of Schlitz. I will also be canceling  5 other
accounts that I pay for which include the accounts that are used by my
mother and my girlfriend . Please don't argue that I am exaggerating ,
because I have heard it too many times."
