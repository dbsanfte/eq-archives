Yep, for mostly totally free sites (well alla is the only semi pay
one, for features you dont' really need but would be nice) these
really contain tons o' info. The three combined beat the holy crap out
of any hint or clue book you'd pay money for. Mostly the thing that
makes allakhazam and Eqtraders so great is the input of many persons
giving hints of their own and information which is almost always valid
(or is soon corrected by someone else)

Eqatlas doesn't have as many maps as I'd like but its the best totally
free map site for EQ that I know of. The maps and zone guides are
quite well done.

Allakhazam's is totally insane. Nothing is or probably ever will be
its equal for item, creature or faction info.
