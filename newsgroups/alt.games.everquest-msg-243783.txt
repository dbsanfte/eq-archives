It is changed.

Using the maps from www.eqatlas.com, the old walkthrough was A B C D, i.e.
entrance to teleporter A, destination A to teleporter B, destination B to
teleporter C, destination C to teleporter D, destination D to gate and globe
teleport.

Now teleporter B goes to teleporter I. Get off that teleporter and right
back on again to reach destination I which is the same as the old
destination B. Now continue to C and D like before the change.
