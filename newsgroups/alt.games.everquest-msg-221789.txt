You only have to run fast enough to outdistance the mob, how far ahead of 
it you get is not that material.  I have clicky SoW boots which makes me 
fast enough to outrun 99% of the mobs in outdoor zones, and I have run 3 
for indoors.  There are places where levitate is needed, and some where 
it is handy, but most places, I click it right off, in front of the 
"friendly" necro that just cast it on me.  I do thank him though.
