Hi All

http://www.tk421.net/character/

Hehe! I broke the site <grin> when I hit return after answering them 
all. Tried 5 times playing with the browser settings. I got an:

"Internal Server Error
The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was 
unable to complete your request.

Please contact the server administrator, webmaster@tk421.net and inform 
them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done 
that may have caused the error.

More information about this error may be available in the server error 
log.

Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use 
an ErrorDocument to handle the request."

Well it confirms what I always thought. I am a technological jinx. 
Explains why Everquest keeps crashing on me.

So to Babylon 5 vs. Deep Space 9

<grin> *Doe's a quick dynamic risk assessment and puts on CE marked fire 
proof clothing.*

In Europe and the UK at least B5 was far more influential than DS9

The fact it was not prime time viewing was due solely to the marketing 
power of the two companies behind them.

In the UK word of mouth soon meant B5 on Channel 4 was getting much 
bigger audiences than DS9 on BBC 2.
Much to the irritation of the BBC who had bought DS9 and Voyager as a 
double deal. Miffed them so much. they didn't put a serious bid in for 
Enterprise. Or buy the later series of Voyager until the prices dropped.

Now the personal thoughts.

B5

1) had multiple stories that continued through the entire series. quite 
often 3 or 4 in the same episode (Okay Soaps do the same)

2) It tried to inject reality taken from our experience (no money in 
Star Trek?) See Garibaldi versus the Post Office. If you think fighting 
invisible aliens was bad!

3) No black and white politics, everyone had an agenda. Everyone was 
right and wrong.
See Dr Franklin's dilemma over a sick child.

4) Continuity. One plot line was introduced 3 episodes earlier by a 
headline on a newspaper Garibaldi was reading. The camera didn't even 
draw attention to it. It was a throw away action.

5) Evolving characters and stories. (See 3)


DS9

1) At first was it was one off stories. (Miss one episode who cares)

2) Still had the slightly contra sending moral attitude of Next 
Generation and Original Star Trek .
The Prime Directive, don't interfere if they do it our way. But blow the 
hell out of them if they don't. (Humm! where have I seen that before on 
earth)

3) No continuity.
Technobable the universal plot fixer. 'You have an identical plot to 
last week and need to disguise it use Technobable. Covers all known plot 
howlers and glaring continuity problems in one difficult to say throw 
away line'

4) Early on no Evolution. Each episode reset the characters to their 
start positions and then
pressed play

4) Evolved into a B5 clone (As viewed in Europe due to the delay in 
broadcasting)

So how am I going to get this back to the topic of the newsgroup. Well 
here it is.

B5 = Old Everquest Players Vision

It's addictive, you have to continue to see what happens next. How will 
the characters expand, what is over the next ridge. Where will this 
quest lead. What will I get if I do that quest. Where will I find a 
group to help me get the item I need. It has more bug's than an unwashed 
dog blanket.


DS9 = New Everquest  Company Vision

Flash, Bang, Wallop. Play it leave it. Who cares what happens next.
  "Pass me a new toon D00D this one is $*&� crap it couldn't eat Vox in 
less that 59.7 seconds".
The walk through on that site is rubbish. It didn't tell you about the 
rare, triggered on a Tuesday by a druid sneezing, wanderer that beats 
the &$%�ing crap out of you!
Humm! I need to finish that epic today for the raid tomorrow. I'll buy a 
couple of accounts with 65 level characters and quad bot it. Did you 
know that you can recharge items by selling them back to a merchant then 
buying it back, great exploit D00D.


Final Note.

Thank you for the way you replied to my earlier posting on LDoN the 
Early Levels.

I deliberately constructed it as an Unreal Tournament Stat's post to see 
what the group thought.

You didn't fail me. Though the direction it went was not the one I had 
considered. It still proved you cannot predict everything.

That what makes a good game and a good TV show.

You cannot predict it
