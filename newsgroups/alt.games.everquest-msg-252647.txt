I've got a friend who I'm gunna hook up with EQ using my buddy key but the
problem is that his internet dosen't get hooked up until after the 2nd.
I figure I could use my computer to get his account going but is there a
quick and easy way to do this or will I have to load the games in a
different folder from my regular EQ folder thus having two separate EQ
files(sorry cant figure a better way to phrase that)?
Any help would be appreciated.
