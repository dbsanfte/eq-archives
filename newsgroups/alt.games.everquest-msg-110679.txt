This is usualy considered to be a Bad Thing (TM).  The fact that society is
going down that toilet is undisputable.  OTOH, the fact that society, in
general, sees the problem, and is trying to fix it suggests that while
conditions are worse, society is better.  These killers are outside society
(at least for my definition, if you choose to include them for yours, then
you have a valid point).

At the same time, hypocracy has increased in other places, including in the
relations between Church and State.  The state no longer runs the
churches... but now, Judeo-Christianity has almost achieved a pariah status;
just look at the Borking that Ashcroft recieved during his hearing, all
because he's a christian.
