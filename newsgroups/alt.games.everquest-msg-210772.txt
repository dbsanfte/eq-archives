I get random tells all the time for focus items (mostly Damage
bracers).  When I enter a group I make it very clear that now
is the time to ask for any foci - I usually get a couple of 
requests for a damage bracer (the range IDIV item is still really
spendy) and a couple for the spell haste ring.  Almost never
for the nuke-mana pres earring (I believe that's because Caster's
realm still lists it as an aggro reducer) and absolutely never
for the buff extending mantle and reagent conserving neck.

I'm guessing that, when my usual group helps me quest the BAIV
item, the druid in our group will ask for it rather than the
nuke bracer.

Interesting question that I don't have time to pursue yet, 
do BA items work on epic dots?  ID items don't work on *most*
clicky nukes, with the exception of the Burnt Wood Staff.
