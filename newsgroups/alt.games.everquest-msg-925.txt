With a good connection, with low to little lag, I can keep almost 4 songs
going, yes. But I have noticed that I am better off trying to keep 2 songs
going strong. Anthem sticks for a while, so I play my "crappy" DD song, and
Chords of Dissonance as I am fighting. I am not for certain, but I dont
think that the healing song will heal except when the song pulses. At least
that is my observations, and will look more deeply into it.

However the reason for this post was to rant a little, and to share my
discust with the way this particular druid was using his Tunare given
skills.

Here "I" am a Bard and former Druid taking this and running with it.
