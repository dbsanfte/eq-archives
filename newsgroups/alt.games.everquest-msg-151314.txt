Depending on what you already have, the Belt of the Khala Dun isn't too hard
to get (+4 WIS, +3 STR) - and you can prob start getting skulls off
tormented Vah Shir in Tenebrous for Shield of Bane Warding quest, although
other pieces won't be in your level range yet - shield is VERY nice reward
for a quest that took me about 2 weeks at 52-53 lvl
