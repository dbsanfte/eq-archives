This is mostly true even on RP-preferred servers.

Because Sony made it do more than turn your name purple.  It makes it hard to
find out your class or level, so no group can tell if you're appropriate for
them.

If it were intelligently designed, it would do NOTHING but make your name
purple, and put an (rp) in /who listings.  If you also wanted to hide your
class and level, you could /anon in addition.

Actually, I'll feedback that (in EQ1.  EQ2 folks have to feedback it
themselves).
