Thank you Splendid for clearing that up for me.

I don't know what it is, but it just seems that since I have been playing
since september of this year for about 12 hours a day, "Yes I am an EQ
addict", I have never experienced this type of problem before until today.
Which is why I posted in here in hopes that someone or anyone would be able
to shed light on this problem for me.

And NO !!!!!!!!!!!!! I did NOT buy my characters.  I created them and
leveled them up from 1 to where they are today.  Those in the Drinal server
that see the red armored Elf, Elfton or Elftons, know that I have labored
long and hard to evolve them into what they are today.  It seems strange but
I feel as tho they are a part of me.  I play these 2 characters as I act in
real life.  Always there to lend a helping hand to anyone who needs it.  I
am still the newbie, in my opinion, to this game for I don't know a whole
lot other then where to level and where to make plat when I need an item.  I
don't have any clue what most, if not all, of the focus effects are.  Nor
can I outfit my characters properly to get the best stats I can. Partly do
to lack of huge amounts of plat do that I guess. But I keep working through
day by day trying to learn something new.  Ok, I got off on a bit of dribble
here, sorry folks.
