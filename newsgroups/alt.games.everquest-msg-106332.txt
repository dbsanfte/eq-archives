Snip

Verant already did this in their overall design. Brad McQuaid stated
in a post from early year 2000 on the general EQ boards that the
reason why stats do hardly nothing is to not make twinking that great.
There are a couple of items like some very good weapon, such as you
mention, or a fungi tunic which will tip the scales but overall its
not that big a deal (the fungi is really the most outrageous since for
a long time the character will heal faster than mobs can damage it)

So the game is designed to make much of the twinking pointless. It
works for the most part.
