For me, I ask myself some questions and act accordingly:

Am I on my way someplace I need to be now?
Are folks waiting for me there?
How am I being asked? ("sow plz" gets ignored. "Excuse me, Princess of
the North, but may I be bestowed with Spirit of the Wolf please?" gets a
full set of buffs for free.)
What mood am I in?

Sometimes I go to the gate and just say, "Alright, who needs a bind?"
and bind everyone for free. 

Other times, I ignore everyone,  including the urgent tells.

It varies.
