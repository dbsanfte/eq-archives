Stan,
	It would feel weird if someone called me Quind because the
name doesnt naturaly break there in my ear, but it would not cause an
issue with me....   my Pet peeves usualy come up with the lack of
manners of many individuals in game (and in RL too, or in usenet
eheheh)
	Have you ever called McDonalds micky-Ds?,  Jack in the box
jack in the crack?  you local convience store Quick-e-mart?  Tissue-
Kleenex?    its all in the culture....

	Some may say Chanter, others Enchanter, or Enc(I always think
encumbered grin)..

Have a good day

Quin
Quind
Quindell (it dont matter as long as your not doing it to be a jerk
grin)
