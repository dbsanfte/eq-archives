Except that an employee making this decision behaves differently. There 
is a 'mob mentality' or perhaps its because he's shielded by anonymity 
and layers of people exist between him and us. 

If we all could KNOW who had made these decisions and were held 
personally accountable for them, if HE had to phone us personally and 
let us know what HE was going to do to our credit cards. There is a 
pretty high liklihood these decisions would have been made differently.

We are all profit driven. *We* however are not exlusively profit driven.

/agreed 

The moral standing of soe is not really relevant here as I don't feel 
obliged at all to allow them to take the money like this. I know it has 
nothing to do with their status as a corporation because I would not 
feel obliged to permit *THIS* even if it was a so-called 'debt' to a 
person. 

If I owed you 15 dollars and you approached me about it and I was busy I 
might say to grab it out of my wallet on the table. If you then took a 
20, and then put 7.00 change in, making a two dollar error I'd certainly 
feel I still owed you the 2 bucks. 

If a month later I saw you rooting around in my wallet without 
permission I'd call you a theif. Whether I owed you the 2 bucks or not.

If you approached me, asked me for the difference, I'd pay it without 
question. 

Same with Sony.
