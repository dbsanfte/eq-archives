Won't do any good. Alt.net is notorious for harboring spamming troll
scumbags like him. If you persist on complaints, you'll get some line
of tripe from the owner about freedom of speech and such crap.

Companies like this don't care about a bad reputation. They thrive on
customers who are troublemakers and know they won't lose the account
with them like they would with most reputable online services.
