It's about time for me to suck it up and head to PoP.  Velks was great for
getting rid of my training wheels, but I can't endure another slow grind
like that.

I've heard that a duo of a 59 ranger/shaman is possible in Teir 1 planes.  
I'm told mobs hit for 200 or so, and I can tank mobs that quad for 250 in
our duo, so we're good there.  I'm not anti-group of course, but I don't
do pick-up groups and many of my friends are either in Teir2 already or
have iffy schedules.

What interest me mostly is...which Teir 1 has the least amount of slow
mitigation?  Best sorts of resists for shaman nukes/dots?  (IE, should I
assume that PoD mobs have crazy disease resist, thus making one line of
his dots useless?)  As far as AC, HP, and how hard they hit, I'm guessing
they are all about equal, but if that's not the case, that's good to know
too. :)
