The other clerics get hit, too. And so does the offtanking warrior,
the pullers, the other tanks. Each and every one of them gets smacked
around, but the only one who is *always* guaranteed to be excessively
smacked around is the main tank.
I've seen a cleric act even more loot whorish than Fignewton's, in the
name of 'I deserve it for busting my ass'. She bullied her way to
several HoT pieces and ended up having leggings chained to her when
they were supposed to go to a paladin. Reasoning? Oh, he was less
useful than her, and oh, she had that wonderful leggings effect and
oh, those other clerics don't contribute like her (she bullied them)
and no, it doesn't matter that she has more pieces than she really
should have, almost a complete suit and only the main tank has more,
because she should be prioritized just like the main tank was, so
screw fairness and just wager that everyone will accept it because the
armor can't be removed once chained and as the only epic cleric she is
too important to be messed with... 
Guess what? She wasn't.
