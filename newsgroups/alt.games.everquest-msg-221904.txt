You will ALWAYS get a reward from him if you hand him exactly 4 whiskers, 
so long as you do not stack them.  When you hand him one, it opens a 
window with that one whisker in one of the four boxes, you then place the 
other 3 whiskers, one each, in the three remaining boxes in the window, 
then you press the "Give" button to give him all four.
