Many mobs are immune to movement speed changes too.

Speaking as someone who cannot snare, and has had the chance to play with 
it using a clicky snare item, it does really trivialize my soloing when I 
can get it.  When I can't, I use root to keep mobs from running, sure 
they continue attacking until the bitter end then, but, it's the price I 
pay for not being a snaring class.

Complete heal was what made many of the old high end encounters possible 
to actually conquer without an army of clerics.  The time it probably 
really broke things was when level 60 was added.

Some mobs mitigate, some are immune, many are affected fully, or at least 
mostly by it.  A 70% reduction in damage output of a mob is pretty game 
altering, and makes many encounters extremely difficult, if not 
impossible to do without one of the primary slowing classes.
