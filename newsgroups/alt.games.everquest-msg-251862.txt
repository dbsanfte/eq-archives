I bought the GoD CD and installed it.  At the log in screen, its still
showing I  "don't"  own the GoD expansion and it's still giving me the
option of ordering it.

I haven't found anywhere to enter the key code from the CD, and there's no
other options at the log in screen other than "ordering" it (which sends me
to the sony sight).
Basically, GoD is installed on my machine, but is not on my account.

What am I doing wrong?  I know the old log-in screen had an option to put in
the key code but the new log-in screen doesn't.  Any help would be
appreciated.

Thanks,

Ching
