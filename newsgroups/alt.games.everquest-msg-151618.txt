What is wrong with "I will help but I want a stone?" Two stones
drop each time, after all, and if you can muster a group and a half
and you find another druid or ranger who can muster a group
and a half, you've got it.

In fact, rather than hollering in open channel, you could send tells
directly to other druids and rangers openly making this offer.

Even more clever, make arrangements in advance with other
D/R that you've come to know personally, so that if either of
you spots VSR up, you contact the other and both muster a
force.

Too, you should be looking around for friends who will help
you out on things like this.  As a porter, it should be easy
enough for you to make friends even if you are an ardent
solo artist, just as my (mostly solo or guild group) cleric has
tons of people willing to come help him out on special projects.

In addition to whoring out your porting ability, make a point
of helping people out who are trying to do their own epic
mobs or other big projects.  Put people like this on your
friends list, and call on them for help when you need it.  If its
not often, you'll be surprised at how much support you can
call on when you need it... and need it you will, cause it
will be harder to kill Faydedar than it is to kill VSR.
