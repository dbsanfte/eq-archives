15...20 levels..and your chant wasn't resisted ?

It's apparent you don't like 3/4 of EQ or want a completely different game.
Kiting and kiting spells and several kiting classes and quad kiting classes
have used aggro kiting for 5 years.
It is a HUGE part of EQ's design and design of classes.

Why play a lame game if you don't like it.
Or do you want only classes, spells, MOBs, Mob AI that have no kiting
ability or utility..
IE: your game your way.. ?
Start designing a new game I guess because lots of EQ and EQ classes are
kiters.
