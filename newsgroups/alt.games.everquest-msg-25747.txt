No need to look it up.  Who's bashing who now?  Using the word "friend" in a
sentence such as the one you quoted is the way I speak, therefore, I typed
it.  Perhaps its regional inheritance or the mere fact that I am Italian
American.  Who knows.

Further comment would only add fuel to the fire.  Dan, I was simply trying
to get across to HIM that the topic at hand is/was not important enough to
waste any further time on.  Its my prerogative, just as was yours to reply
to my post, however, you dont see me bashing it do you?

As for talking down to other peoples mothers.  Nice demonstration of
maturity.  My mother is long and past, god rest her soul.  Thank you for the
clear indication of your personallity.
