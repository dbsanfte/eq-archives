My level 20 ranger (almost 21) has just learned some valuable information
reading these posts - thanks to you higher levels!  I usually solo or play with
just my partner - which is how I LIKE to play.
I started my ranger in Surefall and did level 1-4 in Qeynos, getting a bind
there.    Then I moved to Blackburrow.. can't really use a bow there because
there just isn't room and too many crowds.  (At low level I didn't have a
decent bow anyway).  But it took me up to level 15 or so.  
Using snare is invaluable!  I never have to chase my MOBS down for the kill. 
They stay right there and die quietly.  Always cracked me up watching people
chase gnolls all over the place.
Track is a great tool too.  You always know whats "out there" and can avoid the
critters you can't handle - and its easier to find the ones you CAN handle too.
 Not to mention tracking other people when you are wanting to trade or a guard
you can run to for safety.
I am just now getting good with my bow (in East and West Commonlands..) lots
more space out here for practicing from a distance. 
If you are into the "group" thing tho you may want to pick a different class
tho.  My level 20 barbarian shaman NEVER has to go looking for a group - she
gets requests every time she enters a zone.  But before I bring her into
strange territory I ALWAYS send the ranger in to get the "lay of the land".  
Good luck with your ranger!!
