Good for you, but where you providing the people you were playing
with a sufficient challenge? If yes then you had a chance of winning.
If no then you where sorta wasting their time. Although it can be a
really good way to learn.

In any case the example is not equivalent. In chess you will lose
through your lack of skill. You begin with equal forces and in time
you could probably determine the point at which you lost the game.

If a level 50 warrior wants to PK my level 5 warrior then skill
is largely irrelevant. With the best defense being never to put
yourself in such an unbalanced context. Even if I play perfectly,
and they are sloppy and do dumb things, the imbalance of power
will gaurantee them a victory.

However I will play counterstrike. Even with a Desert Eagle and
no armor I have a reasonable chance of providing a threat to 
someone. The maximum advantage they can have does not stop them
from falling in two shots to the head at which point I get part
of their advantage. I can provide a risk and win a reward. Fun.

In an RPG, where character development allows for sizable differences
in power to exist there can be conflicts where there is no possible
chance of resistance let along victory. The only thing I could do
is see how difficult I could make it for them to find me and kill
me. In effect provide them sport and entertainment. I agree with
the original poster, precious few people will find that fun for long.

(must admit i'm dying to see how shadowbane imagines they're going
to solve this problem. That should be incredibly interesting to
watch.)
