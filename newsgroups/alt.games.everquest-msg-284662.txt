This is a noob rogue quest.  You go see a NE lady in freeport harbor and she 
tells you theres a chest sunk in the harbor -- near sharks.  I've looked all 
over the harbor and havent found it or any sharks.  I even researched the 
coordinates at allakhazam but its not there.  Maybe changed in the freeport 
revamp.  Someone in game said its near the rock by the sewers entrance but 
its not there.  Has anyone done this quest since the revamp and could clue 
me where to find the chest?
