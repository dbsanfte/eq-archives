I saw a monk in Freeport the otherday making Eye of Zomm's. When I asked how
he did it i got the reply, "magic! :)" Is there some kind of item that lets
you cast this? I am a warrior and since a monk can do it, perhaps a warrior
could. It would just be kind of neat to whip out for fun. Please help me.
Thank you in advance.
