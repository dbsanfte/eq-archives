I'm reminded at this point of a rather opposite situation.

I and my guildleader at the time, a cleric, were in Frenzy in Velk's with 
a bard and some melee types.  Pulls were steady, and we were keeping a 
satisfactorily large camp clear.  And we were chatting in /gu, since we 
were the only two guildies on, and we noticed that not only were we both 
full mana, but neither of us had been below about 95% for the last half 
hour or so, despite everyone being healed and buffed to capacity.  I could 
get down to 85ish for a bit if I nuked a bunch.

So I piped up in /g  and asked the bard, well, how about -not- playing 
mana song?

Needless to say, he was floored.  No caster had ever asked him that 
before.  He wanted to know why.  So I explained that mana just didn't 
seem to be a problem, so maybe he could play something else, or give his 
poor fingers a rest.  So then we started getting creative, and soon 
enough, our mana was regularly cycling up and down as it ought, and we had 
a -much- larger camp cleared.  Mobs were charmed, cool buff icons flashed 
all over, the whole nine yards.  Sizeable and interesting pulls were made 
so I actually got to do some crowd control beyond '2 inc'.  It was a 
blast, and very good exp.

Mana song just ain't everything, you know.
