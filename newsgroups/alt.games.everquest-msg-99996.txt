  By modifying your eqclient.ini file.  Read your eqmanual_supplement.doc
file for details on how.   There are web sites and special programs designed
to help with just this task, just do a search.  A guy named Pasketti made
one eqclient.ini file editor.  I'm sure if you do a search on his name or
any of the other relavent keywords, you'll come up with something.

  Good luck.
