A Damage Shield is a spell cast on you and lasts about 4-6 minutes.
Everytime you are hit the mob also takes a given amount of damage. Lets say
you have a shield of Thorns (49 Druid Spell) and the mod hits you for 2 pts
of damage he will also take 27pts of damage from the Shield. Damage Shields
do not count on anyone's Damage total in regards to the kill. So if you do
not inflect any damage at all  no one gets credit for the kill and no exp is
given. But on the reverse side if you inflect 1pt of damage on a new mob and
the mob dies from the Damage of the shield you get credit for the kill.

Runes are a temporary Absorption shield so if you have a 400pt shield you
can take 400pts of damage before it starts taking away hit points. Once the
400pts are gone so is the shield it does not regenerate.
