Clever. Maybe once you have made it through your copy of
"Grandstanding EQ Metaphors for Dummies", we can have some productive
conversation. Until then let me simply say that I am perfectly aware
of my own opinions in this matter, and they are valid.

Of course I should! Every negative aspect of life could be considered
evolutionary side-effects or categorized as the natural tendencies of
a particular link in the natural food chain. Fortunately, as humans we
possess a higher intellect and the power of reasoning. Morality, where
present, should be considered in all matters. It is immoral to allow
an innocent child to die as a result of their parents' shortcomings.
The OP stated, "Rather than celebrating the removal of horribly flawed
genes from the pool, they made the toy nearly impossible to kill
yourself with. That was truly a sad day for humanity."

For starters, this comes closer to your own wording of "wearing a
party hat and passing out cake." than anything of which I have acused
the OP. It says that instead of working to prevent similar tragedies,
we should do nothing and allow them to happen - and worse, to be happy
they did.

What do you mean "Exactly"?! This is the one of the key points of my
entire objection! If you agree, why are we having this silly argument?
Also, since you evidently agree with that point, it stands to reason
that this is not a skin density issue.

You can check that one off now...

The concept is the same though. How about, "Anyone stupid enough to
run into a burning building the way those firemen did on 9-11 should
be removed from the gene pool." Exactly the same type of example, and
a stronger attempt at what you are calling humor, and it is still the
subject matter that eliminates any possibility of this being
considered anything other than offensive.
