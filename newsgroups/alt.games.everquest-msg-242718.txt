Silly question first, you are killing the right mobs?  I know it sounds 
daft, but the two items each drop from a specific (different) mob.  Just 
in case, see next paragraph :)

 From http://everquest.allakhazam.com - You are looking for two 
medallions in Dulak's harbor. Both look like gold coins and are called 
"A Golden Emblem" (magic item, no drop, ranger only). When identified, 
the item lore in your chat box is: "Symbol of Karana" or "Symbol of 
Tunare." You need one of each emblem. They seem to be a fairly rare drop 
off of "a shady treasure sorter" and "a storage worker" in Dulak Harbor. 
The sorters have the Karana symbol and the workers have the Tunare 
symbol. These two mobs are mostly found in warehouses along with "a 
storage attendant" but the attendant does NOT drop anything for this 
quest.

I hunted for ages in Dulak because it is a nice zone.  I did get my 
spell, but it took quite a while.  Whilst I cannot be certain as I never 
actually took close not of timings, from the /ooc chat I get the feeling 
that one of each drops once per day.  Now that may well be game day.

Also the quest can be MQd, just in case you find someone with the other 
item to the first one you get and who doesn't actually want it!
