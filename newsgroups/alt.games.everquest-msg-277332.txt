I have used a couple so far.

You can imbue items with additional stats, the stats increase with the level
of the stone/tooth/flower/scale.

Alchemists create extracts from the items which are then used by other
tradeskillers.

The specialist books can be purchased from the tradeskill vendor (basic
level 10 one).

My jeweller has made imbued pristine rings of turquoise so far with an
additional +4 intelligence.
