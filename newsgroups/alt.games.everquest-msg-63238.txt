Actually most states now have laws stating that if someone brings a lawsuit
against you, and it is wrongful (no chance of winning, or just outlandish),
the judge can (and usually will) order them to pay your legal fees.

I know this since my wife was hit by a drunk driver, and he sued us because
one of her tail lights were out, and that made him hit her.  Of course, in
America being awarded the decision in court is only 1% of the battle.
Getting the money is infinitely harder.
