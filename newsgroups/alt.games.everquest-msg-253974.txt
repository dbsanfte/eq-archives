Yep, that's why the EQ proc'ing weapons and Anger augs failed to
address the tank balance problems in PoP.  The geniuses at SOE
created vast masses of content that heavily favored aggro over
survivability (given the massive game-wide boost to mana regen),
and that left alot of Warriors i the lurch.

In one trial.  They nerfed charm in the Ikinz trials very quickly.

Apparently tanks in guilds that've farmed the snot out of PoTime

EQ is full of stupid shit like that, has been for as long as I
can remember.  Their basic design strategy often appears to be:
1. Do something stupid,
2. Wait until > 30% of the players are screaming about it,
3. Nerf until > 90% of the players hate it,
4. Rinse/repeat.
Not fair perhaps, but it fits far too often.
