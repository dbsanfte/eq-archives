You are an INT caster. Armor and weapons will not do you any good.
Your melee days are just about over. Now is a good time to learn
"crowd control" tactics. You cannot mez or stun, so learn focus on
learning how the creatures path in the dungeon. As a necro you will
need to "control" crowds by not gathering any.

In the Warrens....

Use your pet to clear out the green conning creatures and work your
way in to a spot that you can hold (an area with a low possibility of
adds). Even the lowest level Kobolds can drop Bronze weapons (or
Molars that can be turned in for faction. exp. and cash). So take your
time and kill all of the Kobolds that you can. Focus on making money
(Isn't that what you originally wanted to do?).

Clinging Darkness is your friend. The spell has a SNARE component. Use
it to prevent the creature you are fighting from running away and
pulling adds.

Find someone to group with, preferrably a melee class.
