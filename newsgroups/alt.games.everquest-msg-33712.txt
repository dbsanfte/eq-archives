Very doubtful, unless you mean 48'th level.   A 38 couldn't get near a Vox
raid.  Generally 45 - 52.

Most likely he was collecting for peridots for the clerics.

In order to cast thier hit point buff, clerics need to expend a 10 - 13 pp gem
called a peridot, each time they cast it.  The spell, which adds several
hundred hit points to the target is too helpful to ignore, but asking the
cleric to cast it 5 times a night on all 6 group members is a bit much, if he
is paying for it out of his own pocket.   (30 casts times 12 pp = 360 pp
expense for each cleric)

Different raids have different ways of dealing with this cost.   On a normal
Hate or Fear raid, the raid leader will generally give each cleric a 20 stack
at least, and collect all of the non coin loot that drops to sell and cover
the cost.

I've never raided Vox, but I think the Vendor Trash you'd get on your way in
wouldn't be anywhere near enough to use this.   Symbol is too important to
leave off (not having it on would be a big step towards a wipeout)... so
someone has to pay for it.   The choices would be the raid leader paying out
of his own pocket, (ouch, 360 pp per cleric, 6 clerics = 2100 pp price tag on
the raid)  the clerics paying out of thier own pockets, or taking up a
collection from the raiders.  They were probably following the third method.
