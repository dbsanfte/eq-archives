remapping is ok, but not if you use those windows keys often.but then
again who uses them while spending 90% of the time in eq anyway.
hahah.

funny you guys should ask this. it seems that on my roommate's win2k
computer minmizing will let him crtl-del-task manager-switch to back
into the program with no problems.

but it doesn't work on my win2k machine so i'm going to eventually
have to sit down and write a program to disable those keys, run eq,
then re-enable the keys again. 

probably too busy to get around to it so don't hold your breath. maybe
someone can beat me to it.
