To me, EW was a nearly perfect zone.  There were several great areas to hunt
in (the bridge, Sleeper's Tomb entrance, Kael entrance, ulthorks, the orc
fort, and the kromriff prison guards), and they didn't really overlap.  The
zone could easily hold 35+ people, and the beauty of if was that those 35+
people could interact with each other via /ooc yet never step on each
other's toes.

The pendulum then swung too far the other way with the PoK.

I kinda like the keyed port idea. You busted your ass to get the key, but
then you didn't have to do it anymore.  It was fun the first time, then that
was it.  You were left remembering the accomplishment, and it never got to
be a pain in the ass like the boats.
