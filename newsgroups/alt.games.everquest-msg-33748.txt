Ther is one new quest which raise Prieasts of Mischief.  It involves getting
some pets and berries and giving them to one of the guild masters.  The
Illusion masks don't simply raise your faction a level, or slightly, what
they do is physically change your race then calculate  it with your diety to
determine your base faction.  FOr example, if you use the EmU to create a
Halfling Cleric and set his religion to Innoruuk, it will yield the same
result as using the illusion mask.  So lets say as a character your base
faction to the Priests starts out as an indifferent 0.  Then your race is
claculated into that, and if you're a Halfling, you'll get for example 2
points for it, whcih will raise you to amiable.  Lets say you set your diety
to Innoruuk, which is a minus 5 hit in faction, taking you to apprehensive
or dubious.  That's why bards/chanters like to go agnostic, they get the
illusion hits/bonuses, but the diety modifier is always 0, which prevents
them from taknig any negative hits.
