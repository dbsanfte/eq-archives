<<<<<<When I play a group dependant class and none of my friends are
currently online or in the zone I want to hunt in, I have to rely on
pickup groups. It is incredibly difficult to find a pickup group when
you have to compete with mega-buffed players. A group with a KEI'd
Druid or Shaman has no need for a Cleric (or 2nd Shaman/Druid). A
group with a mega-buffed Monk or Ranger has no need for a Paladin or
Warrior to tank mobs. A group with a KEI's Wizard has no need for a
second wizard or mage. You either go and get the same buffs yourself,
or spend the evening LFG. >>>>>>>

Another weak attempt at trying to explain why someone else having a KEI is bad
for you.  This one is as easily debunked as the others.  GET MORE FRIENDS!! 
It's not the fault of those of us that enjoy playing with KEI that you can't
make enough friends to have a group when you need one.  Maybe your personality
isn't very engaging and removing KEI isn't gonna give you a personality. 

I snipped the rest where you try to make the same point over and over again but
basically your problem is that you can't find a group without KEI.  Have you
tried joining a guild or making friends.  I've never had a problem getting a
group when I wanted one.
