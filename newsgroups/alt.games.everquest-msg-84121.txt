It is your imagination unless you call 400,000 month to month
subscribers "losing its title as king of online rpg's." However, going
by numbers lineage the bloodpledge is first with 2,000,000 in korea
alone. EQ follows lineage and nothing else comes reasonably close yet,
not even DAOC.

Neither is really true, the game magazines go with whatever their
opinion is. Most of the game magazines you read right now were not
even ready for the publisher by the time shadows of Luclin went
gold/sold many copies, etc.
