It was a damned sight *more* rosey. I very very rarely _heard_ of people being
scammed, and I never ever saw it actually happen.

Now, I see people trying to scam *every day* I log in, and as a result
*no* strangers would trust anyone with their armour. Hell, many dont even
trust their guildmates and 'friends'. That is a significant cultural change;
theres a marked lack of roleplaying compared to back then, too, and dont
even get me started on the changes in the game mechanics. ;)

Counter Anecdote: 
A level 7 monk fell down the tree in blackburrow. I was a heady level 18 or so
with a blackened iron broadsword ; I was *uber*. I jumped in and looted his
body for him, ran to the top, and gave him back his gear. As I recall, it
consisted of odds and sods of patchwork, a few shurikens and some bandages.

He was profoundly grateful ;) I also had strangers recover my corpses for me
in Runnyeye with no problems.
