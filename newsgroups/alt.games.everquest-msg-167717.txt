Whee! 100 hp every 15 seconds.  Root would probably break before the second
one finished....

Aside from the fact that I did not have this item until I was ~well~ beyond
the levels we are talking about.   And if you want to talk about now...
anything blue would waste me in about 3 combat rounds  ; p

I could solo back at level 60.

I would make about one blue of AA per hour....  If I was lucky.
