Bah, monks do it even better.

For my brother, who is just getting into it and I want him some level
to play with some of my alts, my 40 monk has PL'd BOTH his froggie
warrior and woodie druid from level 5 to level 35 in a 3 day span, simply
by beating crap down to 5-10% and then FD'ing.

And in case anybody wonders, both characters' combat skills are
all maxxed.  Poor druid is going to have a time maxing out his spells,
though, although not quite sure what spells to pick and choose
seeing as he has his level 5 spells and his level 34 spells and
the only one in between is SoW :-).
