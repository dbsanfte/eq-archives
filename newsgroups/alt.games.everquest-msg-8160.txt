Anyone see TDS today or yesterday?  "Lord Viper Scorpion" made another
appearance, and he was talking about how he plays on-line games and
such...he was making a joke about how you can "communicate knowledge"
between players on on-line games, and while he was giving an example
of chat among players (a bunch of trash talkin') a screenshot of EQ
was up on the background, of a mummy in Unrest.  I wish I could
remember the trash talk exactly but it ended "...then I'm gonna crap
on your paladin"

I thought it was cool :)
