Personally, I'd like to die asleep in bed of old age, having lived a
full life. The only reason I would have died in a Blackhawk  would be,
like I said before, if it was my job. Now , if I'm on my way to work
and some a-hole rams into me, oh well.

Well, then I guess all skydivers would love to die having their chutes
not deploy and have a full few minutes to look at the ground rushing
up at them.What do you love doing??
