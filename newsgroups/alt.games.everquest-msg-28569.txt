There are two easy solutions:

1.  Ask your groupmates to turn autosplit off.

2.  Ask them to give you gp "change" for a pp or 3.  My suggestion
only redistributes coins among group members, it doesn't
create or destroy them -- you could only "lose" gp by gaining
some pp, and the gp would still exist be in the pockets of your
group members.  If you were truly so "on the edge" of having
the "exact" amount of gp necessary that you could drop too low
when looting, just get your "lost" gp from your group
members by asking for it back.

Plus, on the whole, after a few more loots you'd have a net
gp gain anyway.
