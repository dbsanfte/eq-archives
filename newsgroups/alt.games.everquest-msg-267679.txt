One way for mobs to get items they "shouldn't" have, is for someone to 
charm them, then give them the item.  After charm drops they can be 
engaged, killed, and looted... and the loot will include the items they 
were given.

I don't know any normal explanation for the flavor text though, that 
sounds like a GM was playing around (which of course is another way that 
random mobs can get "wrong" items)
