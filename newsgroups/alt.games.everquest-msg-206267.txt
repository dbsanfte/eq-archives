After you had received the rude answer you should have waited a minute or
two before you had send him a new tell regretting you refusal, then tell him
you will port him now. Meet with the bastard group and then port him - not
to the place where he want to go but to some far forgotten place where all
mobs and guards is KOS to him. Before the little bugger know what's going on
bind him there and gate away. That'll teach him a lesson to remember. To
ensure he'll really remember mock him until he log from the game.
