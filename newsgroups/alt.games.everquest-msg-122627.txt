I'm looking at items in Vex, and it's like some kind of bad joke.

For example:

Halberd of Destruction 
Armor Class 30 
Weapon Skill 2HP 
Damage DMG: 30  DLY: 42  DPS: 14.52 (has damage bonus) 
Magic DMG Fire: 35 
Boosts STR: +25  STA: +25  WIS: +25  INT: +25  HP: +125  SV FIRE: +50
SV DISEASE: +15  SV COLD: +15  SV MAGIC: +15  SV POISON: +15 
Effect Searing Flames (Combat) 
Class PAL, SHD 
Race ALL 

Had they introduced that weapon into the game a year ago, nobody would
have believed it was real.  The stats are just TOO good.  It's unreal.
