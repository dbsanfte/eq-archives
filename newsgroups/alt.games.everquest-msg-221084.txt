Yah - but all his gear save the no drop went to Xev on the gear mules - Doh.

Had the account open again for less than a week and have been farming spider
silk for the last few days and buying gear, thankfully the bazzar prices are
so cheap now that he already has better gear than he had beforehand. Spider
silk is selling within minutes of opening trader at 3pp and I am talking
lots of over a hundred at a time.

I have just been ghetto bashing so far as the "how to play" info comes
slowly and not so surely back to mind. I died once already to a  vacant
minded Liching and dedinged back to 54, thankfully a 280pp essence emerald
later and I was back at 55 again.

The only thing remotely close to dangerous I have done so far was smack the
Taskmaster around a bit in the Echo Caverns.... until Xilniov put in an
appearance, after which abject cowardice became the better part of valour.
