 Just wondering if there are any

I also had a EQ chanter.... one of the most rewarding classes
for us controlling type. I have noticed that sometimes the one
you have targeted has a circle that looks a little more solid.
Almost as if it were a slight bit brighter. This works well when
you only have 2 or 3 grouped, but for large groups it is very
difficult to notice in a hurry.
