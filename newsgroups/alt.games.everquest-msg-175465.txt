(snipped a really good and valid rant....)
>*whew* ... I guess maybe I got carried away, /rant off

This is going to be really hard to do, (or not):  LET THOSE IDIOTS GO!!! No,
you can't stop them from playing, but you can stop them from ruining your
night, and your game.  Just let them *GO*.  Extremely effective:  /ignore IDIOT
PLAYER.  I swear, I feel so much better knowing they can be /telling you nasty
crap and you DON'T EVEN KNOW IT!!!  Bwahahaha!!!!   Taught YOU!!!
*whew*... I'm better now.  
In a "normal" group that I've played in for... say... 30 minutes or so... I
*try* to keep track of buffs.  Even then it can be totally unrealistic, (read: 
Impossible).  Keep in mind at level 30 not everyone can afford 50 plat for KEI,
so mana is my only weapon if I am to be in charge of buffing, debuffing, and
sowing:
My buff starts fading. 
I cast it on me.
Puller is out pulling so I cast buff on 2nd in line.
Puller comes back and I cast debuff, slow, whatever on mob.
2nd Mob comes in, root if needed.  
Puller needs healing, bad pull.
Heal puller.  Hope I don't get agro.  Ok, no agro, wait for kill.  Pray that
the Puller doesn't run off again before I get him buffed, (if it's sow they
always wait).
OK was I on 3rd buffee or did I finish him and is it time for 4th buffee?

Now, add the confusion of Idjits that come in for 15 minutes and then "gotta
go".   Buff new groupee.
Then you have the people that say, "don't give me this, that and the other
buff, only give me a shield", (I know they are trying to be helpful and mana
conscious here...).  Which is followed by group member #2 who says, "I've
already got XYZ buff,  don't need shield or that other buff, only give me this
buff..."
There's no WAY to remember who got buffed when.   I politely request that you
just let me know what ya need, I will NOT take offense.
