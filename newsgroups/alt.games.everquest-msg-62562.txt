Does anybody know what would happen if someone were to install Luclin and
play without activating the expansion first?  Would someone still be able to
see the new character models (I'd assume it would replace the current files
which would cause them to appear) or would you have to activate it first?
I'm actually buying it but I was wondering anyway.  I know you can't get to
Luclin without it being activated, and couldn't play the new race/class
until activation, but what about the character and other graphic upgrades?
Do they still show?

Also does anybody know when us pre-release buyers will get our copy?  Do
they ship them early to get them to us on Tuesday (I ordered from EBWorld
back in early September or late August, one of the first days they had it)?
Or do we get them the next day (they get shipped on the release date)?

As for my previous question (install upgrade but don't activate yet) I'll
try that to see what happens.  Anybody know how it was with Kunark or
Velious?
