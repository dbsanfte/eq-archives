If you're agnostic you might be able to do it in warewolf form. Not sure
about wolf form... my guess is ogres dont like doggies. Theres also a necro
spell that does damage and turns the target into a skel for a while, but I
dont think the duration is very long, and im not even sure they like
skellies. Same for amulet of necropotence.

You can also overcome faction issues by having the mob charmed. Not sure if
this is practical or not as ive never done the stein quest. (but id guess
not)
