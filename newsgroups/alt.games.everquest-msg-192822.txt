I have quit EQ.  I fully expect several posts of "CIHYS?", so I'll get
right to it:  yes you can.  However, I only have one thing to give
away:  the 'secret' of how I became rich.  The ENTIRE strategy is
contained in this post - I'm asking for nothing in return.

This really is no secret, as countless others use this technique.  But
it can get you rich, and it certainly adds another element of fun to
the game.  The technique is:

BUY LOW SELL HIGH

Not exactly a breakthrough, is it?  Nonetheless, I'm spelling out how
I did it.  Are you wary of the risk involved in this sort of venture? 
I definitely was, at first.  So I spent time trying to earn money with
blood, sweat, and tears.  After I decided to migrate away from the
game, I took on the risk of buying/selling - what did I have to lose? 
What I found was a way to minimize the risk.  In this guide, I will
cover what is required, how you can do it, and show specific examples
of how I did it.


### Recommended setup ###

[1] Stable, constant internet connection
[2] 2nd account (not required, but helps big time)
[3] Luclin


### Steps ###

[1] Acquire *some* amount of cash or equipment.
[2] Become a 24/7 bazaar trader
  [a] 2nd account really helps here
  [b] Get in the habit of checking /bazaar as often as possible
[3] Sell your char's equipment *for profit* when not playing char
[4] Buy back same equipment (or better!) when you see the right price
[5] ONLY BUY EQUIPMENT YOU CAN USE
  [a] If you can't sell it, at least you can use it!
  [b] Notice how this minimizes risk?
[6] Only buy equipment with a low supply : high demand ratio


### Commentary ###

* The bazaar search tool will provide you with the information you
need to make wise pricing/purchasing decisions.  Use it wisely to
compare stats, prices, and supply/demand. Use it constantly! 
Eventually, it will become a "stock ticker" of sorts for your venture.

* Keep track of prices externally.  I wrote down the price and supply
of interesting items on paper.  /note SUCKS.

* Don't buy items with a high supply or a low demand.  If an item
doesn't seem to have a high supply at the time you search, look up the
item on Allakhazam's and determine whether or not the item is easy to
get.

* Only buy equipment you plan on using.  IT ONLY BECOMES RISKY if you
buy an item that suddenly won't sell, yet you have no use for.

* Don't price your items to sell.  Price your items for profit.  This
means don't get into a bidding war with other traders.  Come up with a
reasonable price and stick with it.  With 24/7 trading, your price may
become the cheapest (in time).

* This technique really only applies to the items costing less than
10k-15k.  Once you get higher than that, the items becomes harder to
resell.  The 'sweet' range for items with good turnaround is 2k-5k.

* There is a problem with posting this technique to the masses.  It
really only works when you have less competition.  I guess you will
all see how this one plays out!


### FAQ ###

[Q] I have no excess equipment, how should I proceed?
[A] It's not excess equipment that you want to sell.  It's the
equipment that your char has equipped!

[Q] If I sell my equipment, won't my char be naked?
[A] Yes.  Deal with it.  You'll have a wad of cash in its place, which
you can use to buy back equivalent or better equipment - for a profit.

[Q] I have no cash and no equipment to start out with, how should I
proceed?
[A] Farm silks and pelts, and sell those in the bazaar.  If you see
silks or good pelts on a random NPC vendor, buy them up.  The Halas
PoK book and NE Feerrott have proven good farming grounds for me. 
Note: These are items you will want to price TO SELL.  Don't price
these for profit, as you will have a hard time selling them.


### Equipment Examples ###

(Note: These examples taken 4 months ago on my server, so they are
probably not valid)

High supply / Low demand (AVOID!)
- FBSS
- Centi LS
- ODS

Low supply / High demand
+ SMR


SMR - This item always had a high demand because it has good stats,
and a really useful focus effect for kiting classes.  However, it
always had a low supply because two classes use them for their epic
quest, which constantly takes them out of circulation.

I would typically buy an SMR for 3k-4k, and resell for 5k-6k.  I
probably made ~30k off of this item alone.  Yet each time I went
hunting with my wiz, I had a robe fit for quadding!

FBSS - I tried this item a couple of times.  However, it would never
resell for profit.  There were simply too many others that were
willing to underbid me.

ODS - This item used to have an extraordinarily high demand, with low
supply.  However, that sentiment quickly changed as soon as PoP was
released.  You have to be mindful of how changes to the game will
affect the economy.


### Character Examples ###

[Quellious] - My main was on Quellious, and this is where I began the
buy/sell game.  I started it at level 52 with approximately 3k in the
bank.  I worked my ass off for that 3k!  By the time I hit level 60, I
had over 250k.  If you have ever bought an SMR on Quellious, chances
are you bought it from me!  (and you probably want my ass on a plate
for jacking up the price)

[Vallon Zek] - I decided to try the buy/sell game from scratch.  I
chose a PvP server.  The economy on a PvP server is different because
people are looking for gear to be an effective PvP-er.  I started off
by going directly for the silks and pelts.  After level 5, I had 300pp
from those alone.  After 2 weeks of buying and selling items in the
100pp-200pp range, I had just over 3k.  I was level 14.  It took me 52
levels to acquire that much with my main!

(go go evils!)

[Fironia Vie] - I decided to try the buy/sell game again from scratch,
but this time on a server with a really strange economy: most items
are droppable!  The economy is indeed much different, but it's simple
to learn.  Using the same technique from VZ, I had 2k by the time I
reached level 10.


### Conclusion ###

This buy/sell game is fun.  However, in the end, you will learn that
gear is not the ultimate factor in how effective your char is.  Well,
the droppable gear, that is ;)
