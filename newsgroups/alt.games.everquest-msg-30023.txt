You used the "root and rot" technique? Hmm...I had to use a variant of
that technique:

Snare, Root, Dot, Dot, sit down to med, stand up quickly and run over
saying "hey that's mine!", repeat until they get the message, run away
from mammoth who has just gored you for 80 points of damage because
the root failed, recast root frantically to get mammoth to stop,
recast Dot, stand guard over mammoth until it's dead to make sure no
one else tries to kill it.

I found kiting, while less mana efficient, at least limited the
accidental KSing.
