I've only seen him once, as well.  And I quickly deposited him on the poor
unsuspecting guard (who would loose no XP, and didn't have to go through a
nasty CR).  Of course, I was 25 at the time.  Sure, that may not be raid
ready, but it's a far cry from the WC levels that guards were supposed to
end at.

Isn't that kind of like the nicoderm patch?  Sure, you're no longer
depending on guards, but you're still relying on Gate and the zone lines.

Why not the main one?  Isn't that like me saying "sure, that zone line
behind you is a valid escape method, but it should not be your main one."

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
