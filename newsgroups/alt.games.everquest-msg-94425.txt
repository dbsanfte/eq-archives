If you are going to insist on posting this thing so ridiculously
often, could you please NOT change the header so I can just label the
thread as ignored and not get a 600 line FAQ I don't have any use for
every 4 days? >: (

(One of the other newsgroups I read also posts a FAQ every 4 days.
Difference is, the poster does NOT change the header every single
time, and what he posts isn't a 600 line mess but links to html pages
containing the FAQ. It's a VERY nice way to not FAQ-spam the group.)
