Sharpton Sees Conspiracy to "Blame the nigga"

By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

NEW YORK, Oct. 25 - While most Americans around the country are unable to
feel the full sense of relief that those in the Maryland and Virginia area
do now that the snipers have been caught, most are happy that the horrible
killing spree has ended. 

Just don't count the Reverend Al Sharpton among them.

Mr. Sharpton was in Harlem yesterday afternoon tending to his high
maintenance pompadour, and his mood was angry and defiant, the talk not of
relief and justice, but "conspiracy". 

"It says right here that that this nigga wouldn't hurt no one!", shouted
Mr. Sharpton while slapping his copy of the late edition of the Times.
"Ask any of them profilers they gots on TV and they tell ya all that it
had to be a devil, a cracker that done lost it! A cracker that couldn't
keep all the thousands of years of evil bottled up inside of'm anymore and
flipped out!"

Hadn't Mr. Sharpton seen the footage from Tacoma, and Montgomery, Alabama?
The legal problems and depositions from John Allen Mohammad's divorces?
The Bushmaster rifle in his car?

"Bushmaster! The Bushmaster who done planned this is the one who tells the
Bush in the Whitehouse what to do!", Sharpton retorted. "I ain't seen a
nigga set up like this since they shot King in Tennessee." 

"What's this bull about a 'duck in a noose'? Anybody see a duck in a
noose? Just like it always been in America it's a nigga in a noose! Been
goin' on like this for fo hundid years and it's gotta stop!"

The other men in the barbershop all nodded in agreement and murmured
"Tell'm!" and "That's right!"

Mr. Sharpton was just getting warmed up it seemed.

"Isn't it interestin' that they done linked a real brother from the
Million Man March to this sniper hunt in D.C.? Now you tell me why a
brother like that would be down there pickin' off brotha's that at their
jobs? How stupid do yous think we all is?"

"Ain't no brotha from The March shootin' hard workin' brotha's in D.C.
This is the most evil conspiracy that has ever been perpetrated upon black
folk. This had to come from the head devil his self!"

With the murmurs of "Tell'm!" and "That's right!" turning to angry cries
of "Blame the nigga", the barbershop environment became an increasingly
hostile place to be.

One of the crowd broke free, pointing an accusing finger in jabbing
fashion at this reporter. He was identified by another as "James X" and
wore a t-shirt emblazoned with the slogan "One Bullet One Cracker!"

His nostrils flaring and spittle flying from his mouth, eyes bulging yet
fixated, he shouted over and over again "You crackers is devils!"

Thankfully someone stepped in front of him while another grabbed him from
behind locking his arms as he continued to shout "You crackers is devils!"

All the while Mr. Sharpton never paused.

"We is goin' to have to march! This ain't just about justice no more. This
is about evil! This is about an attempt to shut down the reparations
movement! The devils is conspirin' to stop us from gettin' what's ours!"

Finally someone from the back stepped forward and with "James X" still
shouting "You devils is evil!" and Mr. Sharpton continuing to rant the man
firmly stated "You have to leave."

The barbershop wasn't scheduled to close for many hours, but his point was
not arguable.
