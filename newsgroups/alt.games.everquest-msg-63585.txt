That's not quite true (but they did say that btw). The install program also 
adds an App Path entry in the Registry. I recently wrote a program to allow 
quick (and easy) modification of this entry. I just use it to reset the App 
Path when I upgrade/reinstall my OS. My other utilities use this entry. 
That's about the only reason I wrote it.

You can get it from my website at http://www.geocities.com/thorgrud/ if you 
want it. (I just put it there.)

PS - Drovar, I apologize for moving your reply down to the bottom of the 
quoted text, but it's really annoying to read threads where one person is 
top-posting and everyone else bottom-posted. I hate it and I'm fairly sure 
others here do also.
