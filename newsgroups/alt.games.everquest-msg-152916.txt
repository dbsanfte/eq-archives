You know, I'm starting to think that it's not that you have no clue, as many
have suggested.  Rather, I think, there is something about you that just
makes the druid style of play not set well with you.  Maybe you just don't
like quadding for some irrational reason (just like there's no ration reason
I loathe Crushbone and refuse to take any character there), and have a mind
set that prevents you from playing a druid to their best ability.  In that
case, it's not the fault of the druid class, but rather a simple fact that
it's not the right class for you.  I know others that can make the class
sing.

OTOH, I know many mid-level enchanters who are absolutely hideous at the
class (and one is a top-notch monkey).  I guess some classes just aren't
meant for some people.
