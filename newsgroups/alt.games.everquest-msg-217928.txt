I disagree.  I've done quadding with another wizard, and with a 
wizard-druid duo.

Two options,

1. one person collects the quad and then you alternate AoE nukes - 
halves the mana cost for killing the four mobs, as long as you 
coordinate your direction and timing this is trivial.

2. one person collects the quad, second person kills it while first 
person gets another.  Since collecting the quad often takes the most 
time, this can speed up the overall process.

There are other options within that since druids and wizards snare mobs 
at different times during quad collection, for instance you can have the 
druid collect four unsnared mobs while in wolf form and the wizard can 
snare all four at once with an AoE Snare.  Much easier than having the 
wizard collect four and then try and snare before they catch up to them, 
etc.

Ping Pong the quad back and forth - reduces the distance needed to quad 
in - halves the mana cost per wizard/druid.
