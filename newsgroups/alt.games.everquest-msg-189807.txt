Keep in mind that nukes count their entire damage when determining
who gets the kill, regardless of the target's hitpoints at the time
the nuke lands. Example: mob has 100 hitpoints, you do 75 points
of melee damage to it. If the cleric now kills it with a 90 point 
DD, you lose the exp.

That's how it used to work anyway...I've been out of the loop for
awhile so perhaps it's changed.
