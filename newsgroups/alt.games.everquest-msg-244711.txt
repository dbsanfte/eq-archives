I have heard there is a controller (NS 52??) from Belkin which could be used
for this purpose but I have asked around here and noone locally sells it. I
prefer the SWG harvesters and macro-foraging to the EQ method, but otherwise
I'm aware of no method that'll forage and autoinv while you're afk. I am
confident that people use either macroing s'ware or controllers to macro.
Theres a guy on rodcet nife with hundreds of planar oaks he's foraged, and
that's really beyond a joke if he was supposedly there foraging.

At least if macroing was built into EQ, it would be a level playing field;
as things stand, non macroers can't compete in the bazaar against macroers.
