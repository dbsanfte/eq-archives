What exactly do you think the druid line of spells does at 60? Did you
perhaps mistakenly presume to think that they got better? natures touch
heals 978 for 400 mana and is the 60th level druid healing spell . This is a
ratio less than 2.5 to 1.

I have seen complete heals heal over 7k hps . I have also seen a lvl 45
cleric doing this at both greig fights and sontalaak fights. This is a ratio
much better than I described for clerics since it takes some skill or luck
to time healing that close.

Hopefully most of you are not idiots. All you need to be able to do is
observe without the preconceived blinders on.
