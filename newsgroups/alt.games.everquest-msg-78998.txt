Well, I ended up going back to UseUmbra=TRUE. To me, there was a VERY
noticable difference in visual quality. The Umbra engine models shadows much
better (exploiting T&L hardware?). With UseUmbra=FALSE, shadows were simply
an inky black clip plane some distance from the character. With
UseUmbra=TRUE, the shadows were transparent at that range, fading into
opaqueness - making MOBs visible at longer ranges.

I'm running with Athlon 1600+/Geforce3, so running with UseUmbra=TRUE isn't
really a performance penalty, except in Rivervale.
