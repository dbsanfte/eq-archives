My judgement suggests that sacrificing one point of HP for one point of 
Wis might be a mistake.  Certainly one HP for one mana is a poor trade

HP is a more useful tool than mana for a shaman; given HP you can always 
make more mana, even if you run dry on mana you are still not nearly 
dead.  Run out of HP though, and dead you are and your mana pool with 
you.  So if you are in a tough fight, you stop cannibalizing for a bit, 
yes, mana starts to drop but you have a reserve of HP to stand up to the 
beating, and then when things are back under control, its back to 
turning HP into mana, and using regen (at lower levels) or Stoicism (mid 
range) or even Incomplete Heal or Torpor et al to restore HP with a net 
gain in mana.  Substantial net gain I should add.

I've been known to argue for HP over mana for MOST classes, but for a 
shaman its more than just a suggestion, its gospel.
