I read in here awhile back about assigning skills to buttons, such as
sense direction to the move keys, this way when ever you move, you
sense direction and level up the skill pretty fast.  I did this to my
forage skill and at lvl 14 I constantly forage up food and drink...the
down side of this is that alot of times I run up to a Mob, don't
realize I have foraged up some veggies or something, click on the Mob
to target, and instead of attacking, try to give them food !   :-)
