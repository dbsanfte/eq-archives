I hit 46 and I'm working on 47 to go to a Fear raid at the end of
September.  I need advice on gear.  

My regular equipment is:
  
Primary (Hand/Melee):  Dragon Horn Ykesha 
Secondary (Hand/Melee):  Short Sword of the Ykesha 
Ranged Weapon:  Trueshot Longbow 
Ranged Ammo:  None 
  
Armor & Clothing 
Head:  Ry`Gorr Chain Coif  
Face:  Velium Star Ruby Veil 
Chest:  Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate 
Left Wrist:  Ry`Gorr Chain Bracer 
Right Wrist:  Ry`Gorr Chain Bracer 
Neck:  Ry`Gorr Chain Collar 
Hands:  Ry`Gorr Chain Gloves 
Shoulder:  Crested Spaulders 
Arms:  Ry`Gorr Iron Armgaurds  
Waist:  Runebranded Girdle 
Legs:  Ry`Gorr Chain Leggings 
Feet:  Dwarven Work Boots 
Back:  Lizardscale Cloak 
  
Jewellery 
Left Earring:  Orc Fang Earring 
Right Earring:  Orc Fang Earring 
Left Ring:  Platinum Fire Wedding Ring 
Right Ring:  Rune Etched Wedding Band 

and stats come out as:

Hit Points:  1399 (1244 Sta, 155 HP) 
Mana:  924 (874 Wis, 50 Mana) 
AC Gained:  142 (NB: Total Raw AC From Equip) 
Min. Weight:  47 
  
Statistics 
Strength:  109 
Stamina:  104 
Agility:  114 
Dexterity:  115 
Wisdom:  85 
Intelligence:  75 
Charisma:  90 
  
Resistances 
Poison:  23 
Magic:  38 
Disease:  23 
Fire:  29 
Cold:  39 

So far, the best resist gear I have is a Crown of the Froglock Kings,
and I owe that to a higher level guildie who takes us under his wing
and puts up with me being such a noob to the game.  I don't have alot
of pp, about 1k at the moment, so I'm looking for items that that drop
either solo or with one group, perhaps two groups if I plan ahead.  
Any advice would be appreciated.  Everyone tells me that nothing can
prepare you for the planes except being there.  But I'd sure like to
be as prepared as possible.

Any helpful advice is appreciated.....
