I've never seen them say anything about there being any logged out
limit.  I've had no problem getting an XP res after 2 hours logged in
followed by 18 hours logged out, which would be over the limit if it
was 3 on/24 off combined proportional.  All I've seen states is "3
hours".

Anyone got a link to a statement from Verant?
