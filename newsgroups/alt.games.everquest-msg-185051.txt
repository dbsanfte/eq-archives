whatever this problem is - it is clearly trader related.  I run a
bazaar mule on a second account, as well as a bot that I play quite
extensively.  I can play the bot for hours, with not the slightest
hint of the problem (state of the art machine, stabe cable
connection).  On the weekend, especially on raids where I have to
concentrate on my main or in zones where the bot isn't flagged, I
"watch" my trader mule.  Last weekend on Saturday, I had a dozen
crashes in tradermode, especially if there were any purchases.  This
has greatly improved since about Sunday afternoon - there was a no
downtime filechange btw that got patched - my trader staid on Monday 
for the first time since LoY, and actually survived 3 transactions in
a row.  So I hoped they fixed the problem, just to have the trader
crash on me last night when I was trading with my main.  Bazaar wasn't
overly crowded, the lag was bearable, no LD indications - just crash.
Lets hope they get it figured out soon.
