I just started a new Halfling Character yesterday and was having a good time
slaying snakes and bats with the other newbies in my area, when a higher
level Halfling shouted that he had lots of "stuff" that he wanted to donate
to any low-level players.  He asked us to meet him at the ramp, and then he
picked all our pockets and ran away.

I've never had a character that picks pockets, but it seems to me that this
was a bit underhanded and unfair to us newbies.  If you want to pick pockets
that's fine, but I think it's wrong to lie to get people to come meet you
just so you can rob them.  Especially a level 2 newbie.

Am I wrong in feeling this way?
