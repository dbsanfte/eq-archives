Are apples the same as oranges?  Well, IF you mean "are they both plant 
based seed carriers" then the answer is clearly yes.  But if you mean 
"are they both the same color" or "are they both citrus fruits" or "do 
they both cost the same per pound" or any number or other things, the 
answer is probably no.

If the question was "do the two color represent the same relative level 
range" then the answer "no" is informative"

But if (and I think this is the case) the question is "are they both 
about the same in terms of not being very impressive" then it sounds as 
though the answer the OP would have made would be "yes".  What -you- 
think the answer is would be perhaps another matter, but the OP seemed 
to think that the ability to mow thru orange mobs wasn't anything to 
write home about, and that having to go thru 500 of them to level would 
be really tedious (which sounds a lot like what he was saying) just as 
going thru 500 light blues (yeah, its like that in EQ1) would be.

Killing mobs 3-5 levels above your own in EQ1 would hardly be something 
to sneer at, nor would it be terribly tedious.  Its by no means 
impossible, for groups or for certain classes solo, but its almost 
certainly interesting.
