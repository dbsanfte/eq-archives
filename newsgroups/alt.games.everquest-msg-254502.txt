Thanks all
This will helps and The Shaggy DA answered another question that I had
forgotten to ask (containers in Bank slots) that is ever useful.

How do you drop an item to the ground when you're encumbered? The only way I
've accomplish this is when my inventory was full and dropped the item into
the black window

Thanks again
