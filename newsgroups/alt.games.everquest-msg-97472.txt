After an outing against the triggered VSR for our druids/rangers this
weekend, I had a couple of questions for those of you who've done it a
bit. We wound up with not a lot of people online (as is often the case
in our guild... relatively small with folks in many different geographic
areas and time zones) when we decided to do this. We had a little under
two groups when our Ranger announced that VSR had popped again on
schedule and was on tracking.

We took in two tanks (I was MA, SA was another 55 warrior), two clerics,
two chanters, two druids, ranger, bard, and monk. All were in the 51 to
55 range except one cleric who was 57. We got the kill and the rocks for
the epic bound guildies, but it was a pretty close thing. Both chanters
were playing from the same house IRL and got a huge, near LD lag spike
and the rune chain stopped. I was soon lifetapped into that big troll
swamp in the sky, but the SA was able to pick it up and finish the
fight.

First off, is this a fairly typical size raid force for our level on the
triggered VS? 

Second, we used what seemed to be pretty basic tactics to my thinking.
We did the normal largish, single-mob buffs.  I followed the ranger up
for the turn-in and immediately got aggro when VS spawned. Backed up
after being summoned to pull him to the middle of the room and then
called in the troops once aggro was firmly established. But it seemed
like a very long, hard fight, even without the lifetap problems raising
their ugly heads. Did we have not enough folks? Bad strategy? Or is that
fairly typical?

Last, our spotters occasionally see the "real" VS on track when waiting,
and I'm considering saying "fuck it" and taking the folks in to tackle
him. How much tougher is he than the triggered version, if at all, and
do I need different tactics? Larger raid? Just forget it and wait for
the triggered?

Any advice from experienced VS hunters very much appreciated. I never
spent any time in KC on the way up as, on our server at least, the place
is a hell hole full of three zoners who constantly pull trains and ruin
the experience, so I have very little knowldege of the ways of that
place or it's bigger mobs.
