Fishing is level capped, so you cannot get higher than 5*level.

But if you are a master fisherman (i.e. over 100), there are certain
items that you can catch in various places in the world. Most of these
items are used for tradeskills and are no drop, like that seaweed caught
in OOT. But there are rumors that you can catch gems and other expensive
items by fishing at high levels.

So far there is no difference between catching with specific baits, but
it's nice to know you can play with a tacklebox and make your own lures.
