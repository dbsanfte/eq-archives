This brings up an interesting question....
If the Kitty-folk are religionless...all agnostic.... then how do they do
them on Sullon Zek?  Agnostics aren't allowed on that server.  What dieties

Or are so few folk on Sullon anymore that no one knows? :-)  Been a while
since I've been there myself.....
