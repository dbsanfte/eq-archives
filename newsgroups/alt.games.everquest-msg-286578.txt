I like the froggie Slave area in Veksar.  Its WAY outta the way.  Its
marginally challanging solo (with a possible 3 mobs at once), but root
/ FD is your friend.  But I like to two box most of the time.  So I
usually take something useful like a healer / bard / chanter to
control.  There is one roamer, and one run through the halls takes 10
min or so.  Then onto the other hall.  Spawn timer reset, repeat.  You
can sit forever at the entrance.  No trains or roamers.
