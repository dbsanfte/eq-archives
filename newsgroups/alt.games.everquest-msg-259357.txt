If you have both connections running you can do very simple test: 
- traceroute to your ISP's mail servers.
- write down the first ISP's host (first hop or second, if you use router)
- ping continuously to that first host (they will be different for each 
connection method)
- compare results for DSL and cable. This will answer your question about 
the link. However, the best link to ISP doesn't necessary mean best 
connection to the world.
