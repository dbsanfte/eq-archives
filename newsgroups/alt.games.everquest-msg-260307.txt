I was under the impression that healing a FD monk would get him agro.  Last
night the monk in our group asked for heal and sure enough it didn't get him
killed and the mobs were pretty darn close to him.
Should I always wait to heal a FD monk until he asks for it or what?  I sent
him a tell asking but he didn't answer.  
Enter the light, join the dance....
