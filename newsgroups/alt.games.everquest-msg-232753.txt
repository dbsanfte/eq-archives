            Virtual Currency Pioneers to Join Forces; Internet Gaming
Entertainment Ltd. Acquires
            Yantis Enterprises, Inc 

            BOCA RATON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 22, 2004--Internet
Gaming Entertainment, Ltd. ("IGE")
            (www.ige.com), the worldwide leader in the market for
buying and selling virtual property used in
            multiplayer online games, announced today that it has
agreed to acquire substantially all of the assets
            of Yantis Enterprises, Inc. (www.mysupersales.com). 

            The deal involves both cash and equity in IGE's parent
company, IGE U.S. LLC ("IGE U.S."),
            headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, according to Randy
Maslow, Senior Vice President and
            General Counsel of IGE U.S. 

            Massively multiplayer online role-playing games
("MMORPGs") like EverQuest and Ultima Online are
            filled with virtual property -- things like magic weapons,
houses, in-game currency, and characters that
            are bought and sold on auction exchanges, with thousands
of dollars trading hands every day. The
            total trade volume for virtual property is estimated by
Professor Edward Castronova, professor of
            economics at Cal-State Fullerton, to exceed $400m
annually, with an undetermined portion of that
            amount annually captured in real-world dollars by dealers
in virtual currency and goods. 

            With more than 80 employees and thousands of suppliers,
IGE is the largest provider in the world of
            virtual currency exchange and game-enhancement services to
players of MMORPGs. The company
            provides 24x7x365 customer service and tech support from
its state of the art operations center in
            Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong. 

            "Jonathan Yantis is an entrepreneur who blazed the trail
in creating a market for the exchange of
            virtual currency and property," said Brock Pierce, CEO of
IGE U.S. "This acquisition is a big step for
            both us and the virtual currency exchange market as a
whole, and solidifies our position as the largest
            player in this market by far." 

            Mr. Yantis will be joining IGE U.S. as Chief Operating
Officer and a member of the company's Board of
            Managers. The other members of the Board include Mr.
Pierce, Mr. Maslow and Alan Debonneville,
            President of the IGE subsidiary in Hong Kong. 

            "This is a marriage of the two pioneers in this industry,"
said Jonathan Yantis. "I'm excited to be joining
            IGE and look forward to our future successes together."
