 Well either bard songs have awesome range, or some last more than one
tick/pulse. We were in Nev prep once and the Monks went out to pull
Vulaks guards. Oh, what's that. I FD but Vulak and the guards run to the
raid and wipe everyone out. Cool! Chalk another wipeout up to the Bards
who didn't listen.

 I'd say a rather large portion of our raid wipeouts where we didn't die
outright to the mob, could be attributed to bard songs. It usually
doesn't have anything to do with the Monk 'FDing so close to the group'.
We have one rule on raids: No AE bard songs unless cleared by the raid
leader/pull group.
