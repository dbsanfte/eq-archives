Lets not, since what self respecting monk actually wears the velious quest
armor?  I know ours both said "I only want the legs, and thats just for the

warrior quest armor to the average All/All items that monks are wearing at
that stage of the game.

And I have about 600 ac naked... I doubt a monk has less.
