My guild used to do him the same way we do other mobs that do a lot of 
damage before the slow lands.  A ranger weaponshield-tanks, the chanter 
and shammy debuff and slow, the warrior starts taunting and the ranger 
jolts the mob onto the warrior, steps back and assists along with the 
rest of the melee when the warrior calls it.

Of course, now we don't bother with him...
