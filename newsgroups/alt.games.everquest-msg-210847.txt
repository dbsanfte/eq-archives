One of the two golems that spawns the broodling is single group doable, 
as he does not DT, and, is no tougher really than many pop mobs that are 
single groupable.  The tricky part is getting a single group to him to 
kill him, lots of mobs to go through, but, again, should all be single 
group doable.  This is, of course, at level 65ish.  But, even at level 
65, I am still quite content wielding my epic, and I use the DoT all the 
time.  I have yet to come across a better item to hold in my main hand.
