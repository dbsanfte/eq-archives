I really like that line "gate and come back with a party".  :)
There most definitely <should> be encounters where that is the best
answer to the question "How do I solo this?".  And even tho that's
not too hard for anybody now with PoK ports (melees should bring a
Cleric to help recover after they RangerGate(tm)), only a Druid or
a Wizard can promise his reinforcements that evac will be up for
the return engagement.
