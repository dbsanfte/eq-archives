Everything *can* be boring if you let it. I can recall, well before I
ever had a caster past the low levels, reading about Bizbee taking his
druid to solo in Skyfire and thinking, "Man, those druids are so lucky.
Just solo to sixty. Sheesh."

Well, there's a druid who plays about the same times as us that we often
see hunting solo in Skyfire. He's red to me, so he's 57 or better. He
pulls the named and larger ones that are still blue. (Shadow drakes,
lava walkers, guardian of Felia, Fairey of Dismay, etc.) He root rots
them single. And it takes simply FOREVER. Yesterday we had a group of
five pulling, and I saw him with a Shadow drake, sitting and staring at
it. I had pulled at least seven mobs for our group, and he was still
sitting there with that Drake. Yeah, I can see how that could get boring
to the point of insanity after a while, so it's far from "easy".
