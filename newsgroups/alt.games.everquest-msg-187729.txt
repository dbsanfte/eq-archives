hmm... just help me out a little DT...  lets say group wants to go
deep in a dungeon, where Invis will get group there easier... do the
invis casting classes, only cast on themselfs?.
ok, lets say monk pulls and gets several adds.  Does the enchanter /
Bard / Necro mez only to save their own butts?
ok, how bout MT is about to go down.. Cleric (only healer) calls OOM..
does the Pally not LH?
Id say in all cases they do thier Job... and a cleric's job when
someone dies is to rez them... 
no, not thier job if they are not in thier group/raid.  But it is part
of their class tasking to rez.

of course this is my opinion.
