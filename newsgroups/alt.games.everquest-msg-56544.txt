Truthfully, I like to have SoW on me for all the reasons most have
mentioned.  Once I get my magical tambourine (I channel David Cassidy)
equipped and hit Selo's I like to think of it as hitting the turbo...

Yeah, that is sad.  Nothing worse than a bad bard.  *sigh*

Truthfully, during downtime I typically twist heal and (lvl20) mana
song.  Takes a load off of my healers by topping everyone's health up
and shortens the time until next pull.  However, that also leads to no
down time for moi, and can make a few hour session become quite
wearisome.  Every now and then I'll just put on mana song and get up
and walk around the room for a minute while massaging my wrists.  ;-)

To the best of my knowledge (ok, I know squat really) those clarity's
do nothing for Bards. At least, that's what I've read on the bard
forums.  I'm not old enough to have a song that uses mana yet.
