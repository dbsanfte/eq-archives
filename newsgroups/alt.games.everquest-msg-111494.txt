Hey Jeff,

Try http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/ - you will find just what you want in
that area, they have mobs listed as monster or animal there, so you know
which you can use your nature lovers fear on and which you cannot, which is
what I assume you need to have this info for.

Unfortunately, there aren't many 'animals' in game, some I would beg to
differ with their monster classification, but I don't make the choices. ;)

Allakhazam's Everquest site is one of the best, and the bestiary has lots of
info - including faction and much much more.

Have fun!

Sof
