    Dragon's Blood Earring is vastly overrated. Ditch it for cash while you
can and get something worthwhile. Mosquito Leg, Bloodmetal, Lizard Bone -
you're looking for HPs and some stats out of this slot.

> Neck: Bloodshrine Necklace

    Interesting choice. Most rogue twinks go Clattering Bone here, for the
STR and HPs. Not sure that there's much out there beyond that without
breaking the bank.

> Face: faceguard of bentos the hero

    If you hate yourself, quest up your Eyepatch of Plunder. The stats on
the dwarf mask from Sleeper's are also pretty good, if you ever plan to go
there. Other than those two, Amygdalan Chain Mask.

> Fingers: Velium fire wedding rings

    As you level, start looking at those Valorium rings. When the total HPs
from one of them is close to the same as from your current ones, make the
switch.

> Bracers: Silver chitin wristband
>               Bracelet of fortitude

    You said you were questing up BoBs? This is more than good enough until
then.

> Chest: Fungi

    As long as you're being a rogue and have someone tanking for you, this
is fine. If you're tanking and stuff, look at a Trak BP or something along
those lines.

> Back: Cloak of flames

    Goes when you get Epic, obviously. Heiro cloak is a pretty nice upgrade,
and relatively cheap. If you're lazy about Enduring Breath and need some
resists get a Lodizal Shell Shield.

> Primary: The horn of Hsagra
> Secondary: Long sword of Ethereal Energy

    LSoEE is going to average close to the same damage as the Horn offhand.
Horn has higher ATK (your Piercing stays higher than 1HS for a while), LSoEE
has higher "average" and maximum ratio. Get rid of the LSoEE when you get
Ragebringer, though - the stats on the Horn are much, MUCH better.

> Range: Some crappy bow with 200 range

    Unless that bow has nice stats, ditch it.

> Masks: Mask of deception
>             Burnoose of the Halfbreed

    The masks/hats available are: gnome, high elf, wood elf, dwarf, dark
elf, halfling, barbarian, erudite, iksar, vah shir, half elf. You have Half
Elf and DE. Gnome and Barbarian will cost you way, way too much. High Elf
will require you to do the Ragebringer quest again, and is a big pain in the
ass for something that is just a toy. Wood Elf is done via quest, and the
only tough part is getting live frogs of Guk faction high enough. Dwarf
drops in Sleeper's, but is one of the few illusion masks that has stats
making it worthwhile to wear full-time. Halfling is from Chardok, and is
miserable rare. Erudite and Iksar I always get mixed up - one is Howling
Stones, one is Trak's Teeth rare cycle spawn. Both are cheap enough to buy,
but are just toys. Vah Shir drops in the Assassin room in Ssra, and is a
rare drop.

(lvl

    That gear, by and large, would be good right up to the point where you
raid for gear. There's not much above it other than Cazic Thule the
zone-level drops.

    Not for sale there isn't. Well, let me back up. There's a White Dragon
Helm for sale in the Bazaar on Quellious for 350 K - that would be an
improvement. Otherwise, you aren't finding better soon.

    Forget about archery. You stop using it for a long, long time.

    Chokdai Hide Pauldrons, maybe? There's also a 65 HP PoP item, chain
classes only (Drape of the Proud?), and the 45 HP Midnight Mantle. Midnight
is your best option, I think - very cheap and about as effective as the
others.

    The respawn on the book in Hate is around 10 hours. That's going to be
your limiting factor, if someone already nabbed it before you. The picking
pockets part can be slow on Fourny, too. The fights will be easy for you,
Eldereth should be up... do you have a Kedge robe available for MQ in case
the General doesn't drop the Quill?

    See above. Really, epic/Horn is fine. If you go to Sleeper's at some
point, Primal/Epic is enough weaponry to outdamage most people you'll meet.

    Don't bother. Just get your lockpick skill up to 210 by level 55 and
you're fine for all the doors you'll ever encounter.
