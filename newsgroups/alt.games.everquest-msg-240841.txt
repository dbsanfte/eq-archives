Here's my tip on tradeskill Farming, which can be done by non-evil
characters almost from lvl 1

1) Go to newbie area of Innothule Swamp

2) Hunt Spiderlings - Spiderling Silk (Tailoring and Blacksmithing)

3) Hunt Zombies - Zombie Skin (Pottery and Alchemy)

3) Hunt Snakes - Snake Eggs (Baking and Brewing)

4) Hunt Fungus - Sarcosypha Fungus (Alchemy and Pottery)

5) Hunt Skeletons - Bone Chips (Spell Research and Tailoring)

6) Collect Ground Spawn - Innothule Mushrooms and Swamp Vegetables (Brewing)

7) Empty bags, repeat.


Basically killing anything in this area will have some tradeskill value.
Occasionally, I will have a higher lvl character come into the zone and buy
stuff that they don't want to spend time farming.  Mostly the ground spawns,
which look like red and blue mushrooms, that you will see both on land and
in the water.  They show up randomly, no set spawning place, and are easy to
get if you keep your eyes open and have a good light source.
