From the shadows, the mysterious wrat@fnord.io.com (the wharf rat) (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Ability to follow a conversation is irrelevent. Attributions are for
showing who specifically said what.

Since that did not happen here your statement is pointless. If you
bothered to read the posts you'd see that the statements being
attributed from several posts back were still being referred to
directly in the text.

For someone claiming to be as long term a veteran as you are, you seem
singularly obtuse when it comes to guidelines. Messages in groups like
these sometimes need context from enough posts back that there will be
far more quoted text than new. Maybe if you come from newsgroups where
no one says anything but snappy one liners your inexperience might be
explained.

The fact is, you decided to try to lecture other people on netiquette
and got caught with your pants down, and now you're flailing around
trying to escape the fact you blew it.
