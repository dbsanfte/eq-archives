My most frequent pickup groups in EQ came from running to camp
spots and simply /say Hey guys, anyone here need a 65 mage?

if no response, wave and head out.

if I got a "we're full, sorry" type response 
DS tank, mod rod the obvious casters, wave and head out

Often, however I got an invite, or a tell later to see
if I was still looking.

I did, get an unexpected invite from someone in WoW a while
back that I really appreciated.  Got jumped by hogger on my
warrior and was about to beat feet when I got a heal and a group
invite - obviously a group thinking of taking him.  I accepted,
we dropped him and everyone got their piece to finish the quest.
