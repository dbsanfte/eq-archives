: Hi all,
:
: Received this expansion some time back and have just started doing
: adventures on it, but I am a bit lost.

: 1. There are adventure points - where are they, in my inventory?

Type Alt-V and click on statistics button, or just click on any vendor in an
LDoN camp.

: 2. These points I can spend eventually - with who?

Vendors in LDoN camp.

: 4. Someone always gets the mission - who of?

Adventure Recruiter in LDoN camp.

: 3. Other info - is there a site with info? if so could somebody link
: it please.
:
: Sorry if you think the questions are a bit dumb but thank you for any
: help.
:

There are no dumb questions.  Just ask in the right way, and you get
reasonable replies.  Ask the same question over and over, and you will get
labeled and flamed.
