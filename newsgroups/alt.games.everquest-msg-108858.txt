I remembered this post as i walked through Fryes electronics and saw
DS on sale. I like a break now and then and the only computer game ive
played other than EQ in the past year was Return to Castle
Wolfenstein....mostly for sentimental reasons. Dungeon Siege turned
out to be wonderful. Its fast and fun to play and really easy to
learn. Sort of the opposite of Eq....since I didnt even read the
manual....i just fiddled with controls. I used to play D2 until the
servers were overrun with koreans and I find this many, many times
better than D2. The option to enable or disable PVP is nice since you
dont have jerks trying to screw with you in every game. I wonder if
duping and other hacks are gonna go crazy with this online multiplayer
game the way it was done with diablo. After remembering how messed up
things got on the Battlenet servers I have a renewed appreciation for
EQs system of patches, careful attention to exploits and the presence
of GMs to help mediate things. After all its a pay service.....last
time I got fed up with an online game I quit playing and didnt buy
their expansion pack...nor plan on buying any more of their products.
Along this same line....isnt Shadowbane supposed to be a big PVP
environment? I would shudder to participate in an online game which
caters to the worst of the "character rape" crowd.
