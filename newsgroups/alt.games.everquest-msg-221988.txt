I note he didn't specifically include himself, either.  4 would
be ideal for an LDoN group, although I'm at a loss as to how the
hottub is going to help with the time limit.

Assuming he -did- mean to include himself, then I share your
shock at including only 4 others, when the current grouping bonus
system gives you your 6th member free.

No, wait, perhaps he is playing a druid or wizard, and isn't
looking at group in its "party" meaning, but rather as a target
grouping; those AE spells generally only work on 4 targets at a
time.   Given the use of the hottub, though, I can't help but
think he should be trying out the PB AE line, it seems as though
he's going to be getting all the targets in a very close radius
anyway!
