Nice to see you're not an actual asshole and just tend to play one on
Usenet. ;-)

I'm not a newbie to much of anything except games. I have been a
troll, though not in this group. And if you *ever* call me a 1337 d00d
you may not be able to eat for a week after I slap your mouth off ;p

And it wasn't just that I couldn't reach one site.

But it wasn't just one general site. It was the EQ site after being
dropped from the game.

Currently the only game I play other then EQ is solitaire.

Keep your guard up then. I have cheated when playing Diablo. Not that
it will likely matter, but I only played the cheat character with
others that cheated and NEVER with legit or purist characters, nor did
anything I have leave from cheat character to another legit character.
As weird as it may sound, I believe in responsible cheating. I believe
that every person has the right to play a game as they enjoy it, up to
the point right before they infringe on other player's rights to enjoy
their game the way they like.

Where you can do that with D1 & D2, it's not possible to cheat in EQ
and not affect others. Hence it rocks that you really can't cheat in
EQ.

>The *easist* troll here is 'I wanna have God mode.'

LOL, you people are too easy then.

>The second easiest is 'Why are the servers down?'  

You know, some people don't do web surfing and don't know about
patches and such. You could always just kill file by subject with the
combination of "server down" and use a mark read instead of delete
just so you don't miss threads that mistakenly get tagged as kill
filed.

I didn't see anywhere where people seemed to think I wanted to cheat
at EQ.

It does rock that it's not filled with cheaters. Not that cheating is
bad in my mind, just bad that those that do it don't have the freaking
decency to know that others prefer to do it the natural way and it
screws up their way of playing.

And had you posted that in the first place, I'd have said thanks,
didn't know that and we could have skipped all the crappy flaming.

Yep, doesn't bother me at all, afterall, you're all just a figment of
my imagination. ;-)

But where is the fun in that?

Not in this lifetime.
