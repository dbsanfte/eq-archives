I've been coming here for a while now, and have enjoyed reading all the
post.  Lately it seems like every few posts has somebody ranting and raving
and using terrible profanity.  Look, I'm not a good-two-shoes myself, but
please try to sensor yourselves a little bit.  I'm sure there's a lot of
kids that come here.

I'm sure that the people that are doing this will reply by telling me that
if I don't want to read it, then don't come here anymore.  The fact is, I'm
just asking nicely... please try to sensor your language a little bit.  You
can still get mad and yell at each other without offending others.

It's just polite.

Thanks,

Connie
