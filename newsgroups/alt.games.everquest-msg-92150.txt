Ok all, I'm now level 35 bard.  This is my highest level character, so I
don't know the high end game which is where my questions lie...

First of all, there was a thread awhile back about bards that eventually
trailed off to bards pulling, namely in planes.  I've grouped with others
recently who claim to have high level characters and never seen bards pull
at higher levels.  True, this game is what you make it out to be, i.e. a
little imagination can go a long way, but I would like a little
clarification on this.  To me it seems to be a waste to send the bard for
pulling, as all the casters want their manasong, and bards tend to create
high aggro so I end up pulling a little more than I care to sometimes.

Other question is simple.  I'm using instruments a little more now during
battle.  I'm not sure how I like that as opposed to weapons.  I recently
grouped with a couple of more experienced players that claim I will soon not
be using weapons at all.  How true is this?  I was in a group last night
with no healer and used a lute (no magic instruments yet) to improve hymn of
restoration and chords of dissonance.  I kept all but the tank full, and the
tank nearly full of hp and I do either 30 or 31/tick for damage with CoD.
Add Chains and mana and it seemed a good combination.  I was verbally (well,
chat anyways) assaulted by the tank for not having weapons drawn.  Screw it,
his problem.  But my question is basically how true is this "I won't be
using weapons soon" claim?

Either way is fine by me, but as I'm not a twink and not exactly rich, I
need to upgrade equipment wisely.  If I won't be using weapons much, I'm not
dumping tons of PP into them.

TIA for any help,
SEAN...
