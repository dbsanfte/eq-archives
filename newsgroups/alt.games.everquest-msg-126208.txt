Does anyone know the success rates of making the Velious armors with a high
tailoring skill?  I've looked on eqtraders and haven't really found much on
this.  Would a 230 tailor be successful 1 out of 4 attempts?  Would it be
better than that?  Worse?  How much better success rate would a 250 have in
making the same thing?

Reason I'm asking, is that here recently, I've been taking a good look at my
gear and seeing just how *ghetto* it really is.  I'm about to ding 50, and
my AC 3 legs just aren't going to cut it anymore.

I'm able to solo panthers in WL, so I figured that this would be the easiest
shot at an upgrade since I may be able to bribe a tailor to combine things
for me if I bring everything ready to go in their sewing kit (somehow I
ended up with a not so impressive 3 digit bank account after 49 levels).  If
I give the tailor twice the ingredients, would that be sufficient reward for
the hard work he/she has put in?  Maybe three times the amount?  I'm
figuring if they get a successful combine on the extra ingredients and come
out with a black panther BP or legs, that's a quick and easy 2-5K for them.
If not, it's free (non-farming) chances for skill increases.  Is there any
kind of "going rate" for something like this?  It's the first time I've
seriously gone to do it.  I hear that yew leaves sell good to tailors, but
since they're foraged now, would they still be a good bribe?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.
