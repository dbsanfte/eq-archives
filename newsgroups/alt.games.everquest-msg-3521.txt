The word professional carries many meanings today where it was once
equated with success. You can even hire a "professional" carpet cleaner
but that does not mean that he is a successful individual. In stan's
case unless he's lying he said he was in the military in a previous
post. In that case being a "professional" software developer does really
carry any weight nor value being that the income from this profession
would hardly even be consider "middle class" if barely squeaking in at
the lower end and most likely "low income" hand to mouth.

A more powerful use of the word "professional" would for example be:

Professional paintball player and Texas State Champion 1989. Among other
professions.
