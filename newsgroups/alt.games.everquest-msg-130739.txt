53 Wizard here.  It doesn't bother me.  Porting people to raids is one of
the ways I contribute to the raid.

It seems to me that most raids at our level have three stages:

1. Working our way into the dungeon.  Clearing out the lower level mobs
there.  At this stage, it is reasonable to take on late-comers.  It does not
significantly delay or endanger the raid to send a small group back to
escort someone from the entrance to the raid.

2. The main camp or camps of the raid.  E.g., we've set up fairly deep in
the dungeon, and are pulling tough mobs.  At this stage, it is still
possible to accept a late-comer, but only if they are a class we really
need, or they can manage to get to the camp themselves (e.g., a rogue can
sneak in).

3. Boss or named mobs.  No late-comers at this stage, except in exceptional
circumstances.

At stage #1, I have no problem at all.  Sure, I might miss some loot, but at
this stage, we are doing the weaker mobs in the dungeon.  It's not likely
that I'll miss something major.

At stage #2, I trust my guild's raid leaders.  They won't disrupt the raid
to take late-comers unless they are late-comers that will really help the
raid.  So, if they decide to accept a late-comer, I'll gladly go get them.

It comes down to doing what's good for the guild.  A raid to me is a team
event, and so I do what is good for the team.
