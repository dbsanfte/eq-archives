I have both a level 42 shaman and a level 39 cleric so i can honestly tell
you that at level 30 there wasn't much difference in the healing, they have
the same heal spell and while the cleric actually heals 50 or so hp more
using the same heal spell (sorry can't remember exactly how much it is) most
groups will grab a shaman first because of the sow etc unless they already
have a buff machine. at level 39 though my cleric never had a problem
getting a group as the main healer and my shaman at that point was becoming
more of a shaman instead of a cleric-wanna be. At level 42 my shaman can
keep up on playing healer in a good group even though i only have gheal
still but that is only because i can munch my hp for more mana, but if a
cleric and i were to yell lfg at the same time and someone needed a healer i
think the cleric would get it first in the 40's because at this point they
really out-do a shaman =) (yep the whole reason i made my cleric was because
on guild raids i played my shaman like one lol)
