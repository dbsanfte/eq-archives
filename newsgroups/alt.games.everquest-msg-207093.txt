Ehhh? I never do and can FD quite well. Its not like you can take a
swing at it while casting. If the mobs are in your face smacking you,
you will probably get interrupted, but ive done it successfully with
3+ mobs my level(55) in my face - just lucky i guess *shrugs*, but
being in attack mode doesnt make a difference.
