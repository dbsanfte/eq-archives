Yes, because most people are COMPLETELY ignorant of the game
mechanics.

It has nothing to do with equipment.

/played.
Remember, ours is a raiding guild.  There's a certain mentality that
goes with joining up in a guild like ours.  Good or bad, these people
play a lot and spend a LOT of time figuring out the game mechanics.

Our guild is anything but the 'casual' player that everyone seems to
bring up but can never really define.

Gloves?
You mean the AC12, 5 Dex/Int gloves?  Those gloves are strong for
clerics?

For the rarity and the mobs you had to kill with the level cap of 50,
those items were WEAK.  When Kunark hit the shelves, they went from
weak to pieces of shit.  When Velious came out, pieces of shit went to
"I wouldn't fucking twink with it even if they were droppable".

>That's six of the seven possible pieces. 

Go back and look at the pieces again.
Clerics had it good, they had four decent pieces.  The boots and
gloves you listed are WEAK.

Actually, considering the rarity and difficulty obtaining them, every
armor pieces had several dogs.

It's because everynight I log on I spent 2+ hours dealing with random
tells asking how do they go about joining up.  I got tired of telling
me, minimum cutoff is level 59 for all classes (except for clerics
which is at level 56).  Most folks weren't at those levels and those
that were and weren't guilded usually had some questionable
reputations (meaning forget it).

Mains?
The leads for that junior guild WERE the mains of our guild.  These
were folks who could no longer afford the 8+ hours that our raids
took.  They wanted to contribute but couldn't make the time
commitment.  This is how they contribute.

Depends on the make up.
We go melee heavy, always have and always will.
Get a few rogues in with defensive capable tanks and you can grind
through mobs VERY fast.  Even if you can't find level 55+ warriors,
add on some extra healing and you can still plow through mobs very
quickly.

>Do you folks do anything to mitigate that factor for the
>junior team, or do they farm/purchase all their gems themselves, too?

Gems are centralized.
Mains for our guild take priority.  The junior guilds may draw from
the gem source but are expected to contribute quest gems they don't
need as well.  Everyone is also encourage to spend time farming gems
in SG/Velk and DN.

Ironically enough, it's the stupid "lesser" gems we're lacking.

Per night of faction work is about 3 to 4 hours.
Remember, we're melee heavy.  That means we grind through mobs VERY
quickly.

Icewell Sentries are level 45 to 47, these are easy mobs for any group
over level 46.  They raise Kromzek/Kromrif faction and are very good
exp.  Try it, you might get to like the sound they make when you hit
them.

>Now, compare that with the time required to get Fear/Hate drops.

Been there done that.
Fear/Hate drop rates suck.  It takes even our guild at least 3 to 4
hours to fully clear Fear.  That's with about 30 people constantly
train pulling everything in sight.  The sheer number of mobs you kill
compared to the same set of people in Icewell would be scary.

If you're a warrior and don't have Indocite yet, head to Icewell.  The
dorf's drop RFV.  This is near Indocite quality and a helluva lot
easier to obtain.

You also can DO Kael Arena, just not by yourself.
