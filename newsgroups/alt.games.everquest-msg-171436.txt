Just last night I helped a Bard get to level 20 (first mana song) in
Paludal Caverns. She was in a group and they dumped her (told her she
was useless) at level 19 for a 17 Cleric with KEI.

I can't help but feel that KEI is ruining EQ. Classes that were sought
after for grouping at the lower levels (Bards and Enchanters with
Breeze/Mana Song for example) are rendered useless now with KEI being
whored out in the nexus). Group dependant classes (Monks, Rogues, etc)
are stuck LFG while casters and hybrids with KEI solo like never
before.
