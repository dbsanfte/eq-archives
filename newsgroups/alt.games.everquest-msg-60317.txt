You all seem to miss the issue here, he is saying he hit skip poll
(which is a choice, he says that in the next post) assuming that will
end the poll. Instead now he has to hit skip poll everytime he logs on
or off now.

I on the other hand hit 128 meg ram so I don't see the poll either.
I'm pretty sure the poll is to see how many people have a system
capable of running luclin well (well would be 256 meg ram plus)

We are THEIR customers, not the reverse. Its like he is being forced.
