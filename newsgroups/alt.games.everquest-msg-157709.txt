No its called having focus and raid targets

I personally think your 12 years old for making such a retarded point

Changing a decision for 60-100 people based on 1 recruits views?  Ie not
even a full member?  Im sorry but that doesnt fly with me.

Bens guild has changed their raid targets in light of PoPs release, Id be
willing to bet James' guild has, I've just wrote a new raid targets guide
because of PoP, Id be willing to bet every tier 1/2 guild is doing the same

If you cant live with that, you don't join a raiding guild... it really is
THAT simple
