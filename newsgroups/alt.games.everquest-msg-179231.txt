Aviaks in SK hit a little less hard and a little less often than most
other mobs their level (or so it seemed).  Offense is trivial, you
can gain Offense when your DS goes off.  Weapon is also trivial, if
rather tedious.  After a while you get a pretty good feel for how
much damage it takes to get a mob to turn, so you rot it that far
and have only Flame Lick (or Immolate for higher HP mobs) on it when
it is Snare dumb and beat on its ass until it falls.  I don't worry
about weapons until Offense is already level capped from DS during
Defense practice (practicing Defense on half-dead rooted mobs is
reasonably safe), and lately I look for high blues to work on weapons
as I just don't get enough hits anymore on reds/yellows.  It's harder
as he's moved into his lo thirties because SK has little for him
anymore so I don't hunt there, and the Velious mobs I've been hunting
hit harder than old-world mobs (or so it seems) so down-time due to
melee practice has become more annoying.

Offensive melee skills key off DEX, Defensive melee skills key off AGI.
Optimizing your play for xp gain will usually leave your skills lagging.
(Optimizing your play for xp gain in Paludal Caverns will leave your
skills lost in the dustcloud behind you).  I treated melee skills as a
necessity (old habits die hard) and so made sure that they never fell
too far behind.  He has his weapon skills within 4 of level cap always,
Offense and Defense always are at cap as soon as possible after making
a level (Defense because that's the point, Offense because it just
happens when you get beat on with DS up).

Other details:  While I can't bring myself to give up my weapon(s), I
do go for HP/AC/WIS/MANA without regard to dmg/dly, so my last weapon
upgrade was to some mace with dmg/dly that a L20 melee would sneer at
but it has (iirc) bonuses to all 4 of HP/AC/WIS/MANA.  I never worry
about the rate I gain XP until Defense skill is at level cap.  My
primary killing method is root/dot, I no longer take on full-strength
XP mobs in melee as even with a couple dots stacked on them I will
die before they turn to flee, so I make sure my practice mobs are
seriously crippled (like Harkonnen's nephew, whose name I forget, in
Dune).  Porcupining as a kill tactic never worked all that well for
me, it always seemed as if being half-dead with a mob beating on me
was some sort of signal for adds to vector in from every part of the
zone, so I learned to let them ripen on the vine for a bit before melee.
