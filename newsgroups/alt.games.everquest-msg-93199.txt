Actually, I do know the difference. I said that your "majority" could have started out as
ok but ALL of them turned to flames of Verant. That was true. Your statements still do
not change the fact that you were making in-approriate posts at a sight ran by Verant who
has all legal right to delete what they do not want people to say. It is sad that you
cannot understand that. Sorry for you luck.
