How do three people permacamp something? Do they each solo for 8 hours
a day?

Should I be pissed about every group without an Int caster that takes
Disco in OS because they're permacamping the FBCR?

There's an aspect of the game you might not be familiar with:
Sometimes, people camp things so that they can sell it and buy things
for themselves, rather than camping every item they want for
themselves by themselves. Bastards, every one of them, I'm sure.
