This isn't true of copyrights.  It's true of trademarks, but not copyrights.
Certainly someone's allowed to decide whether they're going to pursue action
against a violator or not.   It's not a valid defense in a copyright suit,
to show the myriad of instances where the holder hasn't prosecuted
violators.

Think I can use all that Star Trek fanfiction as a defense to start up my
own Star Trek network television program with no connection to the current
franchise?

Trademarks are a different story, and lots of people make the mistake in
thinking that trademarks are the same thing as copyrights.  They aren't.

A is the right answer.  B is not.  I asked earlier in one of these threads
if anyone would dispute that SOE could legally ban any player for any reason
or no reason at all.  Or whether they can legally nerf content for any
reason at all.  No one responded.  Are you going to claim they can't now?
Certainly if you don't dispute that they can effectively delete your whole
account, characters, items and all, for any reason at all, you can't claim
that you have a property interest in any of it.

And any court that found otherwise would prevent SOE from being able to
effectively regulate their own game; a game that they created, and host
exclusively on their servers.

It's not a bluff, I think it's merely a combination of indifference and
economic unwillingness.  It'd cost a lot, and probably would just be a short
term solution, which means ultimately that it wouldn't be a very effective
expense.
