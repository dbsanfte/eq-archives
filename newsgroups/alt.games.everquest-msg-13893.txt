I bought the EverQuest deluxe edition from Amazon a couple of weeks ago
with two CD`s,  Ruins of Kunark and Scars of Velious.
The tutorial was on the Ruins of Kunark CD with that. It seems that Verant
are perhaps using the same manual for different versions.

You are definitely not missing much though, as a newbie I found it not much
help at all. I am still trying to find out how to open those two trade 
windows with another PC!.
