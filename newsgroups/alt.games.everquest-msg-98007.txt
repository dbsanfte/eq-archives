Hi all,

I was fortunate enough to be given a Sarnak-Hide mask by a level 50 
character (I personally am a level 9 Barbarian Warrior) an hour prior to 
the scheduled downtime.

My questions on this item;

1 - how much is it worth? I've read various sites and believe this item 
to be of significant value - I dont want to sell it - just wondered its 
value.

2 - At what level should I look to be "upgrading" it - what is its 
"lifetime value" to a BAR WAR?

3 - My weapon is very weak (a rusty two handed sword that I got from 
blackburrow) - should I trade or sell the mask to upgrade my weapon and 
use my 20pp to purchase another mask or should I keep the mask and buy a 
weapon? What sort of weapon should I be looking at getting (preferably 
1HS or 2HS)?  What will give me the better long-term solution?

Thanks in advance for feedback.

W.
