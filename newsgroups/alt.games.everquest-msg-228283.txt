Class alone doesn't make somebody the best puller... a level 1 person
inheriting a 65 bard wouldn't outpull even a moderatly good monk.  That
doesn't change the fact.. a great pulling monk would be even faster/better
if he had the tools a bard did..

Well saying glands gives me snare is like saying a vox stick makes a cleric
unneeded
10 shots of a lore item, out of the way to get again, and not rechargable,
makes it not worth the hassle for the small benefit it gives..
I don't rely on snare for my splits, I use things always available to me..
bio orb (infinite right click), ton po pouch.. (infinite shurikens)..
nothing like learning a split totally based on snare, then running out of
snare charges and delaying a whole raid

/quote on, from probably the top bard on Prexus

Nope

Monks rely on FD and splitting by pathing use. Have no other tools. A bard
with the ability to mez, snare, gate mobs, and fade to split mobs, will own
any monk for pulling anything that isn't incredibly hard.

The only situation where a monk is better than bard is where you are,
indoors, have a limited area to work with, a lot of highly resistant snare
immune mez immune mobs - and you need them single.

For any xp group encounter, a good bard using his abilities can easily equal
or better the monk due to being faster, can debuff the mob before it comes
to group, can mez them so it's mezed near the group without hitting them
first, can pull 5 mobs, mez off 2, fade, and mez the last 3 in camp.

A monk have to work with his groups ability to deal with the amount of mobs
coming into camp - and FD / split accordingly. A good bard is self reliant
and can CC the mobs he chose to bring to the group.

Sure, if you absolutely must have that mob single pulled for some weird
reason, and you can't move people away so you have a large area to work
with, and you don't care about the loss of dps while the monk is spending
his time waiting for resets - a monk is great. But otherwise, nope.

Lull should just be removed tho, since it removes any skill from the pulling
role.
I should add tho. Since monks use pathing, and have used it a lot over the
years to split mobs, most monks are far better than most bards to know when
to stand / split mobs. Most monks have better knowledge of the game
mechanics. But if you were to log on a bard and use his tools with your
knowledge of game mechanics, I am sure you would find it easier to split
mobs.
/quote off

But if you were anywhere near the level of monk you appear to be on here..
you'd know all this already :)
