Yeah, and BOY does it make a difference. At 35 hmm, go to Stonebrunt.
Track down and kill Elder granitebacks and pandas. Cash galore, XP by the
bucket. Fear kiting is your solo friend. As for outdamaging - with
equivalent cash value kit I can hold my own with the others in my guild -
I dont want to outdamge the warriors becuse I want them to hold aggro in a
fight - I do dish it out, AND I have a bunch of spells - Riftwinds
protection at your level is a unique spell that stacks with all the extra
buffs and is asked for by everyone I ever goup with (well actually now I
have a Runed scout breastplate they want call of earth but... same line)

Oh and you can find named people you want quickly particularly if they
wander.

And lets not forget the Dots and DDs we have - OK they are not up to the
nuking standard of a wizzie or the dotting of a necro or druid - BUT
combined with the dual wield, kick and double attacks - they start to rack
up the DPS to an impressive level in group situation I do have to be
careful not to pull aggro

ANd on aggro you are a frontline crowd control character, snare and root
are excellent cheap spells that are SOOOOO useful.
 
Oh and you get SoW, self buffs of resonable level (Im not sure its a full
20 levels difference everywhere in the druid line). There is a handy DD
PoK spell, LoY gives you a niceish DOT in Swarm of Pain. THe spread of
spells is eally rather useful Panic Animal lets you rack up xp for miles.

It has saved my backside on many an occasion, SOW helps you outrun stuff
but track means you can home in on safe points in huge places like the
Karanas. ANd your groupmates can follow you.

We are more flexible. High level our archery comes into its own -
personally Id have preferred to see that earlier myself but hey.
