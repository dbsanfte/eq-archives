Thanks for the info, especially the pet info. I was not aware of that. I
looked at the Beastlord and my main turn off was no ability to bind myself,
unless I missed it.  I made a Monk on AB along with an SK. Might  start a
mage as well.  I'm in no hurry to level or anything as I will be playing
casually so I'll probably level them all up a bit and then take one further.
