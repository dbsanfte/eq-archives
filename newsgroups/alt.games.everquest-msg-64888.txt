Understood on the 'thingy' point.  Was actually just going along with
it.  I manage tech folk and love to watch 'em pull their hair out when
I tell 'em to go swap out the doohickeys.  :-)

Ok.  I now can visualize and understand the deal.  VERY unfortunate.
No real great ideas on this front, alas.

Aye, there's the rub.

Don't have a Matrox card here to look at.  Now I'm wondering if you
actually *did* get hosed by IBM.  If that Matrox is an IBM-flavor, for
