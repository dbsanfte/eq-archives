That zone is a great example of how good the original EQ zone design was.
If you went to West Commons in the low teens, and hung out around the toll
booth for safety, you'd have the occasional Giant come over from the
Befallen side of things, and there was also an occasional Giant visible in
the distance in the other direction.  That tended to make you stay near the
toll booth.  The patrolling Griffins also helped keep you in line.  I
remember sitting at the toll booth, using my Dark Elf racial hide ability to
remain safe while the Griffins flew past, wondering if I'd ever be high
enough level to venture out enough to see the west end of West Commons. :-)

This tended to hide the narrowness of the zone, and it made the zone *seem*
a lot bigger than it really is.  Original EQ was actually a lot smaller than
most people think it was, but that kind of good layout hid that.  (Contrast
to DAoC, which many people thought was small at launch.  The DAoC areas are
mostly square, and the total area was comparable to somewhere between
original EQ and EQ+Kunark, but it didn't *seem* like that).  (The good point
about square areas rather than narrow areas is that its easier to hide
things...at level 50 in DAoC running through newbie zones, I still
occasionally find camps that I totally overlooked because I happened to have
never went that particular way before, whereas I don't think I've ever had
that happen in the long-and-narrow EQ newbie zones).
