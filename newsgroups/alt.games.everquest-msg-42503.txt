When I first started I did read any information on what classes to play or
what what the best choice.  I played what race I wanted to.  I chose a Half
Elf/Druid.   I thought he was cool.  Well now being lvl 32 I realize I
should have taken a halfling.  This is only because my WIS is crap.  I have
a lot of high level gear and I am only at 186.  I am not going to delete him
and start over.  I am just going to live with it.
