It isn't.  Well, not to most Christians, anyway, I'm sure. :) But it 
certainly has a lot of fun with material that -is- canonical.

I suppose it's really the difference between "laughing at" and "laughing 
with", to some degree.

But either way, taking yourself too seriously is one of the biggest 
drawbacks a religion could have, in my opinion.

I stopped in Salt Lake City last week, and wandered around Temple Square a 
bit.  I eventually, after poking about in the museum there, became curious 
about the gold plates Joseph Smith was gven by the angels to translate the 
Book of Mormon from, so I asked an Elder over in the genealogy library.  
He told me that there was a tale about the angels in question coming to 
take the plates back, and that he didn't think there was much information 
about what language the prophet was translating from, and that he didn't 
think there was any record of anyone else having seen the plates and 
making a description. (By the way, if anyone else has further information 
on any of these points, I'd be very curious to hear it.)  He said that the 
angels purportedly took the plates back so their existence could be 
entirely a matter of faith (which struck me as a strong counterpoint to 
the Hitchhikers Guide Babel Fish proof of the non-existence of God.) 

But the striking thing, I thought, about this conversation, was that at 
the points where credulity was most stretched, the Elder in question was 
grinning broadly, not quite laughing, but almost.  Now, perhaps he was 
laughing at the naivete of my questions...  but I think it is far more 
likely that he had an entirely reasonable sense of humor about his own 
faith.  That won big points with me.

Anyway, yes.  I think it is, in parts, a very funny book.  And I in no 
way mean that as an insult to Mormons or their faith.
