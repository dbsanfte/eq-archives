I've got a cleric friend who's still wearing a crystal covered shroud.

Yes, sad, isn't it? ;p  Anyway, she only has about 600pp, but I can help 
her raise more if possible.  The trouble is, whereas I'd *heard* it was 
easier to twink a wis-based char than an int-based char, chest pieces 
for high elf clerics seem to be an exception.  IE, looking in the bazaar 
right now, I see some emerald dragonscales and blessed full mithrils for 
sale - ranging from 10-30k.  Ha ha.  And the best below that, while 
affordable, is only 8 wis for the acrylia studded tunic.  Surely there 
must be better?  She just joined a new guild and is still on probation, 
so she probably won't be able to get any help there for awhile, which 
rules out some of the nicer stuff I saw on Ally's, which her guild 
*could* do.  Just wondering if anybody has any advice on something 
better for her to wear, cause dang, that shroud is getting threadbare. 
;p
