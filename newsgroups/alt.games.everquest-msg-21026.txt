Don'tcha hate it when that happens?  I personally know three
Paladins who lost all of their Soulfire quest items because
they had neglected to get their faction standing with Brother
Hayle high enough.

As for the Aegis of Life faction, the good news is that
while it *does* require a very high faction standing, there's
a reliable way to test whether you're high enough yet.

Talk to Camlend in the UFO (the same fellow you need to
give the Grimrot items to) and say, "Who is Lord Grimrot?",
and "I came to defend life".

If he responds appropriately to both prompts, you're good
to go on the Aegis of Life turn-in.  But if he gripes at
you or does not respond, you need to crank your faction
standing even higher then try again.
