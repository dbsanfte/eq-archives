I figured it wouldn't be a petitionable offense, and yes she was nice enough
to tell me that she would give it up after getting 5 GLSes.  If she had been
a tailor, she could simply have said that and that would have made me
happier, but her telling me (but not being true) that she was twinking her
Level 9 made it that much more frustrating.  Bad etiqette all around, I know
I will never turn into a character like that.  As far as Necro's are
concerned, that is a well known in game need.  GLSes are not.

Her guild may not be impressive but when I did a who all on the guild name
it came up with over 6 people online at that time all over level 35 (if I
remember properly).

Oh well at least I got to rant about this and perhaps some other selfish
high level person will remember what it was like for them when they were
trying to develop their character "naturally".  Not that I am against a
twink, though high level twinking makes no sense - what is there to look
forward to?

Regards.
