Actually, there should be 0% chance.  I've never had this happen or heard of
it happening.  Something must have been done to cancel it.

hehe.. and yes, your corpse would become visible. ;)

Nope.

I saw a site that had tables on it showing the actual percentages to be
expected of normal travel speed.. I don't recall the numbers either but it's
not fully appreciated until levels 20+ and I think at 55 or something it's
full speed.

Does EQ no tell me I've returned to view or I've stopped hiding like
it does at all other times.. ?  I've looted while hidden but haven't really
cared to check my hidden status... good to know. ;) Of course, my DRU
returns to view, Camo goes away, etc., so I should have assumed a Rogue
would also come back to view.

OMG THANKS!!! I'd been beating my Dru's head against the trees on this
one... ;)
