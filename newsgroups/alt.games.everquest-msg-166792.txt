Um, no.  The US didn't become a military powerhouse until World War
II.   The Civil war was heavily dependent on one side or the other
establishing alliances with Britain or France for supplies.  The South
imported most implements of husbandry from the UK. The industrial
revolution modernized the South following the Civil War and only that
transition created the agricultural economy of the era and helped turn
the US into a net exporter.

We were largely isolationist until World War II and barely dragged
into the modern world then.  We didn't become a global economic
powerhouse until the 1950s.
