This is a great FAQ for starting players and even those like me who forget a
lot of stuff.  I do want to let you know, and those who may be wondering,
not all of the versions of EQ that are on the shelf right now include the
printable manual file and the tutorial.  This is available in the Trilogy
set that includes the original EQ, Ruins of Kunark and Scars of Velious.  It
is not included in the box set that includes only the original and Ruins of
Kunark.

I don't know if this older boxed set is still being produced, or if it just
a matter of selling what is still in stock, but the tutorial and manual file
are not there.

Read the eqmanual_supplement.doc in the EverQuest program
>  directory/folder on your computer. Lots of good info there.
>
>    And of course Play the tutorial.
