Basically necros can only mez undead well.  After grouping with a few
necros doing crowd-control in KC basement (all undead) I've decided
that necros can only do crowd-control if nobody else is around.  The
thing is that high-end necros can go non-stop without medding, but
they forget the rest of the group can't, so they have 3 mobs lined up
and nobody able to engage, leads to ugly situations.

It's post 50, not sure of the exact level.  It's a 93% rez, better
than a 49 cleric, not as good at a 56.  The nasty part is that it
requires an essence emerald, which can only be obtained by sacrificing
someone.  The victim agrees to let the necro kill him, and there is no
way for the victim to get any exp back.  The victim also has to be
between level 46 and 59, so you can't have 60s sacrificing basically
worthless exp.  I know necros who keep a 2nd character with them when
they hunt for exp so that they can sacrifice it for emeralds, though
it's probably just easier to solo your porting mule and sacrifice him
down a level every time you run low on emeralds.  You sometimes see
people offering to buy sacrifices from people, I guess to some people
it's worth 500pp to lose 1/2 bubble of exp.

I'll try and get a screenshot of one, but the only guild necro with an
epic will be leading ToT tonight, so I probably won't see her until
later this week.

finally dropped the surname, but they couldn't change my name to a
glyph, was hoping for something that looked like Erudite Velious
