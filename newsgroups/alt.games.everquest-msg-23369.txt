Oh, I dunno.  If you get the meaning across, that can be good enough.  The
trouble with languages as vastly different as English and Japanese is that
often no exact translation is possible.  A word like "poem" might require
two words in Japanese, and translate into "rhyming story" or somesuchlike (I
don't know any Japanese, so don't get on me about that not being the case).
And as for translating the subtle shades of meaning and evocative power of
the poem itself, forget it!

Colloquialisms are also more difficult than ordinary speech, since they only
exist in the language/nation of their origin.  One example I remember from
French class is the American expression "I'm full", which means that one
doesn't want to eat any more.  If you say "I'm full" in France, it means
you're pregnant.  In France, you say, "J'ai bien mange," which translates as
"I have eaten well."  If you translated literally a phrase like "the whole
nine yards" into Japanese and used it in conversation, they would look at
you strangely and ask, "nine yards of what?"
