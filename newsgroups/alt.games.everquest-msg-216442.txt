Yep, I'm surprised to hear it, since the augments themselves are No Drop, but
I'll take Annie's word for it without question; one more in the list of the
many quirks of the FV ruleset.

I am surprised that I haven't seen anyone auctioning to sell augmented items
yet, though.  I my limited experience, most of the augments end up going to
"well someone loot the damned thing, don't let it rot", at least in the 30-34
range of dungeon; if you could slap a +3 cha on something you have in your
trader bag and get an extra 50pp for it, why not?  Makes the augments sellable,
sort of.

Splendid
