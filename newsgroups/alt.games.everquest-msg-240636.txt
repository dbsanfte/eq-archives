You can make the case it gives you a leg-up in the PvP enviornment
where gear can mean you either win or lose a fight against another PC.
But on the blue servers we're all PvE. The only score in this
circumstance is either the mob went down or it didn't, and at the
level we're talking it usually is a cumulative effort not a
competitive one. And Everquest guilds usually have ways of policing
themselves. You can buy all the gear and players you want but it
doesn't buy you experience. Like the new pally that asks how to see
the key ring.. you tell them /key.. and they ask what 'Stronghold of
the Twelve' is in /rs.

>Buying gear isn't much different than buying a higher score in any

If you're walking around in twink gear... the old joke twink was
always the ogre warrior in full Cobalt with epic or you PA'd some
elemental/Time level char.. either you show you know what you are
doing and fast or you get bad mouthed. Having great gear isn't a
ticket to ride if PA'd, especially with a lot of high level guilds.
And for the end game, if you can't get in a high level guild, you're
still just as fucked upgrade wise. You aren't gonna PA yourself time
level drops or even sniff them without one.

And really, 65 char in twink gear with no AA is pretty useless for the
endgame. You've gotta build 100-200AA before you even start to meet
the requirements of a lot of guilds at that level.

>The accumulation of equipment *IS* playing the game.

I would still hold AA has a lot more to do with your productivity at
the end game. It is what gets you the fast accumulation of gear. Your
typical uber guild if you are allowed to app will give you their rot
drops and have you in quite a few Time/elemental pieces soon enough,
but only if you meet the req's, and certainly not if you walk in
having just turned 65 in bazaar gear.

Ok... its called endGAME for a reason.

Have you been in a high level guild? There most certainly is an inner
game that goes on to compete for top spawns, cockblock to prevent
advancement of other guilds, who gets what, and what not. Its gone on
since the early days of EQ. For people who play the game on a more
than casual basis its a level they strive to get to, because only then
will you get the best gear, and its something that PA'ing 200K won't
buy you access to.

Unless of course you were advanced enough at programming and had the
money to pay for the connections/accounts to have most of the raid be
bots. With good programming it shouldn't take a lot to have a few
select real people running a raid full of bots that would in fact fool
Sony. It would actually make an interesting business plan.

Its really not that far away given up front capital and know how. The
programming aspects aren't that hard, especially with strong macro
programs. Sure hope Sony doesn't find you out though hehe.

Yeah.. now if only experience could be bottled and sold.

I've definately seen raid leaders stew over the award until with a
minute left they toss out the names. But 99% of that time was just
trying to decide who gets what. You have that figured out beforehand
since the loot was pre-sold, its just loot/AE TL.
