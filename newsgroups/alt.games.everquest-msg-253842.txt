Wait a second...you can buy meat and turn it into bone chips?  Hmmm...I'd
always heard that the reason bone chips were the only low level spell
component that was not purchasable in unlimited quantities from merchants
was because of the various quests that involved turning in bone chips for
good low level XP and loot.

Does this AA take long enough that it would not be feasible to use it to
load a twink up with thousands of bone chips, or what?
