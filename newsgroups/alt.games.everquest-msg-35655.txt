My Lev 4 dwarf Pally ran from Freeport to Rivervale. Killed twice in West
Commons. I didn't pick the fights... (Dragoon Zytl made short work of me,
then a puma waxed me after that). Getting through Kithikor was easy, I
studied the map, stuck to the path ad ran my butt off. No SOW, and I did not
know what dangers were there, dumb luck!!
