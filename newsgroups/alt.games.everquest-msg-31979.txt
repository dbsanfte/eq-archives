I've never been to South Karana.  I was just working up the nerve to do the
bread quest when I heard it had been "fixed".

BTW, tonight my druid made 15.  Now I have a 15 Half-elf druid, a 15
Half-elf ranger, a 14 Barb Shaman, and a level 6 Iksar Shaman.  And my druid
is halfway to 16.  I've been on a scarecrow rampage all day. hehe  They run
funny but they fall funnier.  They used to scare the crap out of me.
