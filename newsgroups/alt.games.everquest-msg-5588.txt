I used to hear the big raid spam from the critters in SolB and think "man,
that sucks."  Now I know better.  Half the time I'm summoned I'm whacked on
once or twice (at most) and I can walk away...or sometimes just sit down and
med.

I realize there's a few critters in Norrath that when you're summoned you
die (I haven't fought any yet, unfortunately) but usually it's no big deal.
It doesn't bother me in the slightest.
