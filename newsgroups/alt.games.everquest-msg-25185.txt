I have a feeling this guy is in for a pleasant surprise.  It sounds as if he
has never been to his training guild. :)

Nothing like showing up finally to your trainer and see "45 Skill Points".
Woohoo!  ;)

I am not a skilled Paladin and would have to make inquiry to our Pally with
his epic, but, Im almost certain the epic weapon is 2HS.  Though, bashing is
nice for stunning in the earlier levels, you will more than likely acquire a
DW bracer (or two) later in life and will probably be going with 2HS
(Paladins do not get dual wield, unfortunately, but thats a hybrid for ya
;p).

Just be sure to not neglect that 2HS, else it could/will be costly to train
in it to "catch up" later in life.  While its not costing you anything to
train now (or atleast it shouldnt other than points) things later down the
line can cost like 1-10+pp for each training point you use.

Take care o'Holy Knight.  :)
