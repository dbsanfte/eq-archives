OK, I felt the need to post here about this thread. 
I've been reading this thread from start to it's I hope finish.
The one thing I do get is that the guy is truly grieving.
I mean come on, I don't know about you but if I was there last year
and saw it first hand I might be feeling depressed as well , shit ,
I'm a little depressed about the whole thing and I live in L.A.
The guys a Vet and a hardcore one at that I take it so no need to
berate him there. But damn if you didn't like what he said just ignore
the post, don't attack the poor guy.
Yeah, I guess Sony could have put something considering they have a
headquarters in NY but what ever.
And here's where I get bombed.. 
But man some of you just bagged on the guy with no real point. You
just hopped on the flame band wagon.
I mean tyger always bags, so nothing new there. 
And I'm still waiting on Ben to answer his question. 
He even agreed with Remington and still Remington continued to bag.
Well, whatever its 9/12, TV is back to normal. And now I have to go
read Lokaris guide and get my tailoring up.

Sorry you are hurting so bad , but I hope you feel better today.

Newie
