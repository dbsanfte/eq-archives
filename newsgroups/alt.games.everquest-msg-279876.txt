For example, you've farmed all the components required.  As yet, no one
has suggested any sort of compensation for not being the one who
presses the Combine button.  Or, you gather all the stuff needed for,
say, the GoD smithed weapons and assemble them.  You end up with a
player made weapon.  You never had to camp a rare spawn, hoping for the
drop you wanted, but you did have to do whatever was required to get
the parts and pieces.  You are trading the difficulty of the tradeskill
for the difficulty of beating the mob du jour.

No, that's cheating.  I understand how you got that from what I wrote,
but that's not what I meant.  Instead of camping for a Breastplate of
Invulnerability, you might instead hunt down the rare drops needed for
DoN cultural armor.

I like this idea.  I would suggest considering all tradeskilled gear
Attunable.  Equally, pretend that all looted gear is No Drop (or at
least, Attunable).  This is a simple change to make, and it's easy to
be consistent.  Is this alone enough?
