Had my very first Quad Kiting Session today  in LOIO at level 30. Well, okay
it was more of a TRIPLE kite than a quad because I couldn't get four sarnaks
at once, but fun none the less! It is VERY exciting and I enjoy it very
much. At this level, triple kiting sarnaks isn't STELLAR exp but decent
enough :)

And during downtime I play Soul Reaver or Tony Hawk for Dreamcast, so even
downtime isn't a problem :)

Quad kiting is very fun. Wizards rule!
W000T!
