    I think the all your base movment needs to trancend TFC and
Counterstike. It is my opinion that every time a lizardman fort is raided,
or some other base aquired, the victor's shoul cry out "All your base are
belong to us" and then extend this to when monsters have been seriously
0wn3d. All your base is not dead, but it needs to be started. We should band
together
