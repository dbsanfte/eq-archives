If it's big enough to actually *require* a CHeal chain of some sort,
then I think Jame's words ring true. Our clerics get beat up a good bit,
particularly in the beginning before the melee can solidly lock in
aggro. The fact that they are miniature tanks, with a good AC and fair
number of hit points keeps them vertical, which stops the whole raid
from going horizontal. I'm trying to picture a CHeal chain of druids
setting up for Talendor. (Which we did last time with just two clerics
anyway). It would be like watching the dragon eat tic tacs. 
;-)

I'm not sure where we are to draw the line between "real raid" and
something below that. But if it's a situation where you don't have to
give any thought to whether or not your healer is going to take any
damage, it's probably something closer to an xp group than a "real
raid".

However, for exp groups, or small encounters, yes.. I can definitely see
where this would make druids and/or shammies even more versatile, and
open up possibilities to groups that might not come to fruition
previously were they unable to find a cleric.
