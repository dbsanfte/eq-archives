An Ogre Warrior is one of the few race/class combos that actually start out 
with enough STR.  You'll max out STR from items without even trying, so 
don't waste your points there.

The same goes for Dex.  So long as AGI is above 75, it's not terribly 
important.

STA is a harder stat to find items for, and it boosts your HP, which is 
what a Warrior is for.  Put all the points you can there.  You'll have 5 
points left over; put them in either DEX or STR, I would prefer DEX myself.

Choose Rallos Zek as your diety; you get access to a few items you would 
not with Agnostic.

perpetuating upon itself--a barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits
atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred." Frank Herbert
