Not so much skipping as it just doesn't belong in the same category as
the others. Its "content" portion was quite minor, but the vast
majority of people do use it for its other perks.

The real problem was there was no sebilis style dungeon in velious, no
idea why.

But when velious came out almost everyone was ready for the raids, and
kael and tov became the places to be. The lazy groupers stayed in the
easy cycle, but velious was very busy right from the start.

There was groups in ToFS, Kael, and Skyshrine as well, and EW and GD
had their share. Suffice it to say velious saw a lot of attention even
though it tended to be poorer quality normal grouping in both loot and
exp than kunark.

Flawed, but people still did it, and still do. I wasn't a huge fan of
Luclin but you can't deny that it was where most people were.

If VT wasn't the PITA it is, Luclin's raiding would be higher. But VT
was Sony's experiment in "how far can we go making raiding boring
before they stop doing it?"

The difference is everyone at that point is lfg.

When you are doing an offday or its well after a raid ends, that's
when the people go back to where the casual game remains - pop pickup
groups. LDoN sucks that way, and in many others.

Watching my "leaderboard" (another major negative of LDoN among many)
shows that its popularity has dwindled by at least half among the more
constant players. People are bored. LDoN is even more repetitious than
PoP.
