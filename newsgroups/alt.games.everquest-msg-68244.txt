OK, I know it's bad form to follow up my own post, but since we were
doing ToV tonight, and the lag was annoying, I made all the hotkeys
while we were buffing.  It takes a while to get used to, and it threw
my timing off a bit, but combined with the new casting bar it made it
much simpler to twist in a raid environment.  I strongly recommend
that any bards who have not yet done so try this out.  (If you have
different hotkey setups, make sure you don't mess up your hotkeys,
nothing worse then singing your cha song when you mean to sing your
charm song.)
