Good site for Tailoring is http://www.lokari.net and for the rest I just use
http://www.eqtraders.com i think...
but anyways - why do you wanna solo? Its no fun and not worth it. but, if
you must, I would recommend killin blue crocs in oasis or my personal
favorite, take over a derv camp in sro. It's tough with the crappy level 12
pet, but I did it.. you should be able to =P
So, why do you think youre a bad enchanter? It's really easy, just buff,
mez, stun, debuff, and DO NOT nuke... maybe throw in a dot as a debuff but
save your mana, youre better off
Oh and be hyper in /g or everyone will get bored and fall asleep
