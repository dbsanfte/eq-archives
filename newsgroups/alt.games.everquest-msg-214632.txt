This is a very common misperception . Good armor does not restrict your
range of motion at all , though it may require more effort(thus tire you
quicker which is a 'bad' thing )from the weight. It is entirely possible to
tumble (turn cartwheels) while in field plate or chain. Also most people
consider the eastern fighting arts to not use armor, or even more oddly not
use bows , both of which are also wrong. Chainmail and bows where prevalent
in what are generally considered the "martial arts".
