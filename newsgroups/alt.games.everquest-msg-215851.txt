because you can type a fair amount in each line...and I ask english 
speaking members of that language what is the best phrase to use for the 
language specific set of hotkeys.

and i dont use spaces on the NO MANA key, the others are a set of single 
language hot keys, as typically the problem is the puller, not the whole 
group. On SolRo there is a particular spanish speaking gnome SK that was 
heinously able to ignore me and keep pulling, even being spammed in 
spanish. after the 3d time grouped with him, I refuse to be in any group 
with him.

Now yesterday I grouped with a tank who didnt speak english for a hill 
of beans, but was very careful to check my mana and that of the other 
people in the group if there were more than 3 mobs that were next in the 
chute to be pulled. I will group with he and our wizzy again in a heartbeat.

Lets see, Iksar monk in DL...Veltar is a 61 monk NPC, hits for 200+ a 
shot, versus a group od say 40 level people, just hanging out. Dont know 
about you but he has wicked fast and hard hits. Yuo obviously didnt 
spend much time in DL. I know people in their 50s who cant stand up to 
veltar. 2 or 3 dual wield hits and the average robe wearer is pretty 
much toast. Run speed is equivalent to SoW. I could have been at 100% 
mana and just hanging out and a 40 evel group cant handle him.

And I dont know many clerics actively healing in a chain pull that have 
90% mana unless you have a bard singing and a necro twitching. I know I 
have never managed it, and all the LDoN I have been in have essentially 
been one long chain pull style crawl, with a med break every 8 or 10 
mobs of about 2 minutes, and i do the sit, stand, cast, sit schtick. If 
you have a mana source I dont, please tell me. I am *good* at timing my 
spell casting to keep even 30% mana. Short of letting  everybody run 
around at 50% health waiting for a celestal to kick them back to full....

Yet you say that as a healer you are ultimately not in control of your 
mana bar, yet you want to keep it at 90%? cant have it both ways. You 
can control your spell casting enough to time your heals but right now 
my mana pool is something in the region of 3100 or so, going by the 
character file in allakhazams, and lets look at a 2 mob pull.

1 ch to the MT 400 mana
1 celestial healing to wizzy 250
1 remedy to wizzy 175
1 celestial to the MA 250
1 divine light to the MA 350
1 remedy to the shammy 175
1 divine light to BL at 350
1 divine light to MT at 350

[pulled out of one of the fights i had autologged and havent deleted 
yet. Mistmore crypt kill-a-thon]

total of 2300 mana, much of which i medded back between casts. I can 
save mana between banzai runs with my donals to CH the shammy after a 
canni-fest, or to top people off now and then. Often if the fight is 
finished and the MT or MA is at 60 to 70 % health, I will hit them with 
my Donals CH instead of a mana spell. This rate keeps me at about 30% 
mana, as there is always the random need to pop a CH or divine light on 
someone that takes agro for a pound or two, including myself on some 
pulls. The need to always be OTM cuts into med time because we stay in 
one place for about 7 or 8 mobs, then off to the next place. if we could 
pull the entire place to one spot, i could probably stay at 50% or 60%. 
if wishes were horses, i would also have the large black drum [ok, i 
prefer lizards to horses...] At least people are learning to leave the 
blasted chests alone til we are on the way out!
