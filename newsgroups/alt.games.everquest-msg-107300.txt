I guess I'm glad that Rodcet is a bit different then!  :-)  My two
times there have been with my own group.  Even as a 46 cleric, I've
gotten /tells to find out if I was LFG.  About every 10 minutes I'd
see an /ooc or /shout from groups looking for clerics as well.

Of course, statistically, that's just my 2 times there as a sample
size...  but if it stays that way, and I'm not with the guildies,
maybe I'll just go /role and respond to those shouts.
