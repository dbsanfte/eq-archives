Yeah, I was pretty bummed about stuff too... I quit eq for a year and gave
my karnark expansion to a buddy, of course he could not use it.  Thought it
rather odd, but I guess they have to keep making their green somehow.  Since
I came back to eq now, I'm glad that they wouldn't let him do it :)

Key advice here:  Don't buy opened boxes of EQ stuff.
