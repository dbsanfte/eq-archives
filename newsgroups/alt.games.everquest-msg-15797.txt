Yeah, I'm gonna play the monk. But it will probably be after that fat ass troll
is bad ass enough to walk into Dalnir and CC and clean them out to outfit Jakys
and Tirra with equipment that won't be a total *joke* compared to everyone else
at that level. How many other 25 monks do you know that are still fighting
*only* barehanded and are superproud of their four new pieces of Wu's fighting
armor, and have a total of one orc fang earring for stat enhancing jewelry? I
get beat up a lot that way. No thanks. I have seen the enemy called "twinking"
and he is me. he he he.

The monk isn't intended to play with the cleric. Jakys plays excusively with
Tirra the Shaman, and she's also holding at lvl 26 until we get done with these
other adventures.

Yeah, I know. I just didn't want to hurt any feelings in the guild. I'm just
focusing on trying to get to 50 at this point and would like to do so before
the snow starts falling again. LOL!
