The lesson?
For a trip from Qeynos to Freeport, got to www.eqatlas.com and get a good
map of Highpass. :-).

If the server populations are high enough, the orcs should be camped.  If
it's peak hours, the gnolls should be camped, too.

Only on a team PvP server where Highpass is owned by an opposing team, would
I consider running the Gorge/Runnyeye instead of Highpass.
