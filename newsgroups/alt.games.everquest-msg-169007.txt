I did find a "challenged" trader the other day.  He had two types of
diamonds for sale, and it was clear to me how he had intended to price
them, but had made an error.  Of course I took advantage of his error :P

He had priced his normal diamond at 500, and his blue diamonds (12 of them!)
at 200 each.  SCORE!
