Sheesh happened to my first rogue that almost had all BI armor.
I was so close to getting FULL MAGIC INVULNERABILITY.
From that experience I learned there are a few jerks in the game but LOTS of
great ones too.  /sarcasm on - Its funny how the loudest most uber elite
farmers do SOooo much for the struggling newbies /sarcasm off..
Nope just the struggling newbies banded together and had fun. It is amazing
how hard the game was compared to today,  being in banded till the mid 20's
wasn't a problem.
