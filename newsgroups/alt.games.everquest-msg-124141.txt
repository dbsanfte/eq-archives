Not that original post.  :)

I meant the one that started this particular sub-thread, with the person
blaming showeq for someone knowing that Ragefire was about to spawn.

Obviously a hint that someone has a good idea about Ragefire's respawn time
rather than that Verant for some reason would broadcast that Ragefire is
about to spawn to every player's computer.  Verant doesn't always use logic
(or a dictionary), but even they wouldn't program it that way.
