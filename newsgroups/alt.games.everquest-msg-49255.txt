Thats a good note too..more an amplifying point.  There are many zones that
you CAN hunt in, but only in part.  Either most of the zones is too low, so
you are forced to sit in one to a few rooms or the opposite is true and you
can only hunt at the zone line.

From what I have seen, the Chardok changes are for the better.   I must
admit I was a little peeved though, the old way noone bothered our group
there.  Now its like Karnors/Seb/LGuk.  Veks is good as is Charasis.  Cobalt
Scar was sorta of a letdown.  Atmittedly, I havent been back to Sirens since
they changed it way back when.  But at level 50-51 (2 groups) it took a
significant effort just to zone in and take the three entrance mobs.
