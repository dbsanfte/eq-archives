Another good site is www.eqtraders.com.

I think I failed three times at 80 skill and finally made my first Trueshot at
around 110ish.  It's NOT a sure thing, of course, but higher skill helps.
Fletching isn't too hard or expensive to get into the 100 range, but after that
it gets expensive.

Get as many of dem microservos as you can when you hunt, just in case.
