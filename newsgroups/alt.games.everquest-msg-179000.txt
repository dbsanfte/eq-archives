Actually that I think is an effect from you....your class level etc. As I
understand it yes it works as above.

Yes Guk is split live and dead side. The live side are all over the
entranceway - lpus its entirely possible that the new froglok classes
coming may interact with those factions.....and they may have some heavy
guards. The live side is a safe place to hige or run too from the dead
side. Dont wreck it for yourself :)
