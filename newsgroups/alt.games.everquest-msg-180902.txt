I've used the same name on multiple servers, and know of others who
have done so as well.  I've used the same name several times on the
same server, but the one time I did the delete/reroll with the same
name on the same server in fairly close succession the second reroll
got name rejected (perhaps it is/was meant to address some sort of
dupe or nodrop exploit).

One thing to keep in mind, re: the frequent name rejections, is that
we have not seen any clear evidence that SOE/VI has ever deleted the
characters on inactive accounts.  Add to them all of the abandoned
characters on active accounts and you have a rather large number of
names that are already taken.

I have twice been unable to re-use a name and later seen them on other
players' toons, which I took as sufficient explanation.

I'm shocked!  How dare you "ramble" on usenet!  You should be ashamed!
