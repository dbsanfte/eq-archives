Just a bit of humor. The cat(s) are all alive and well. The daily
routine 'round my house starts off with they (and the dog) having
breakfast before we do, making sure the dry food/water is stocked up for
the day, other needs attended to, etc. As to a possible lack of
attention, pfah. When my wife is sitting at her desk playing eq. There's
a cat passed out in her lap. If she were in the living room sewing,
that's where the cats would be passed out. I dont' see it as heavily
impacting their lifestyle. ;-)
