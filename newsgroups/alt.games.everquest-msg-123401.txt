    The first thing our day crew hits post-patch is Drusella, because if we
don't then she'll be bagged by someone else. Horrible bottleneck. It's even
worse when the Japanese guild time-locks her. I don't begrudge them the
spawn - hey, we time-lock them on stuff too even if we don't think of it
that way - but it means we never see her until the next patch, which sucks.
