I've been in Katta off and on and have tried to use the "trainers" at 
location 9 on the EQAtlas map.  They are in the building that has caster 
NPCs in each corner.

They will not talk to me or sell me anything.  I cast Benevolance on them 
and there's no change, except that they are then Ally to me.  They still 
won't talk to me or sell to me, nor to anyone I know.

Is there a trick to this, or are they not really trainers / merchants?

From EQAtlas : 

9 (upper level) Enchanter, Magician, and Wizard Trainers and Spells, 
including high-level Magician pet spells
