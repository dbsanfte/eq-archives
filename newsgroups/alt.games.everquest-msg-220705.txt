Its simple really. They wanted a realistic world... where you could 
'kill the bandits' and 'outlaws' when they got too obnoxious instead of 
petitioning a GM who never shows up anyways.

In the 'real world' one can pvp anyone, anytime... most of us however 
don't wander around ganking old women, young children, or injured folks 
when they're backs are turned just because we think we can get away with it.

And most of us go out of our way to ensure that someone who does go 
around ganking old women, youn children, and anyone else is stopped.
