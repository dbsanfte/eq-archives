I don't believe he's saying anything about enjoying every aspect of the
game. In my opinion he's describing that the design of the game needs
to take into account the effect on the entire society of players over
time, rather than any one person's tunnel-vision view. Saying only
"It's a game" implies a lot of things that are not necessarily
universally agreed upon.

To look at Monopoly as an example, you obviously need rules that are
generally balanced to allow everyone a decent chance, and rules where
the players "work" to earn their win. But since every Monopoly game
starts from scratch, you don't need rules to deal with the results of
previous games - say that the winner of the first game gets to hand
down his cash to his "twink" character in the second game, that will
drastically affect the game. 

In this way, online persistent games have to consider the deleterious
effects of allowing twinking, powerleveling, etc. Even though
competition is less of an issue in EQ, these issues still have negative
effects on the way the game plays that may not be justified by the
postives.
