What Aavon is describing is often referred to as "bulldogging".
Typically, you're bettere off having a second warrior in the group if
somebody is going to play the role of the bulldog, but it *can* be done
IF the ranger or pally or SK has the AC and defense to take a beating
for a while. However, as he correctly points out, that should be
discussed ahead of time.  Having somebody in paper mache armor (/smirk)
drawing aggro off the casters in massive amounts isn't *much* better
than having the mob on the caster. The ranger will live for a while
longer than a wizard, true, but it still turns into a mana sink for the
cleric and a logistical nightmare for the tank in trying to hold aggro.
  If you don't have an adequately equipped bulldog, then IMO, you're
still better off having the tank switch off to whatever's eating the
caster until it's back on him/her, then switch back and finish off the
current target.
