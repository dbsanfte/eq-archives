Has anyone had any luck with the Voodoo 3 card on the test server?  Whenever
I get to the player selection screen, the screen is mostly black, but I can
see where the buttons should be.  At this point my computer locks up, and I
have to hit the power button.  After I reboot my colors are all screwed up
until I go into the normal everquest player screen and exit.  New ram came
in tonight so I added another 512Mb to the 128Mb I already had but that made
no difference.

Does this mean I won't be able to play after they upgrade, so I should
cancel my pre-order for Luclin?  I find it ludicrous to spend another
$100-$200 to play a $30 game.
