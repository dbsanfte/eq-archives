Ok first get mana earrings, until you get high enough to get forest loops,
camp Runney Eye for Black Alloy Medallion,
I would invest in a plat ruby veil or at least silver ruby veil, chest slot
get a blood stained tunic, they drop in Unrest and don't sell for too much.
Weapon well you should be using one too much so no real ideas there. As far
aswhere to hunt, go toHigh Keep Warrior room decent xp and loot with the
added bonus of hunting with a bank nearby. While in HK if you can't get in a
group kill Osargen. He hits hard and backstabs but you can do it, cast root
and wrath he will get you down some hp but the xp is great. The loot on
osargen sucks and you need to kill prisoners first. Oh and stand in the
corner nearest the guard

Hi all,

I posted a week or so ago hopeing for suggestions on where to hunt for
equipment. Since then I have improved my equipment a bit (Some cunning
camping prepatch helped me get a Testament 30 seconds post patch),
however I am still worried that my equipment sucks :-(

Currently I have about 100pp in the bank, but I should be able to earn
some cash over the next few levels so what should I look to improve
first ? What can I hunt for / quest for myself ? What can I buy cheap
off high levelers ? This is my highest level char so I guess that funds
will be limited to sub 500pp total, bearing in mind that my level 29
spells are looming.

Well here is what I have atm :

Ears     : Electrum Jasper Ear AC:0 Wis:2 *2
Neck     : Black Iron Meddalion AC:0 Wis:3 Int:3
Face     : Banded AC:4
Helm     : Savant's Cap AC:2 Wis:3 Int:3
Fingers  : Silver Jasper rings AC:0 Wis:2 *2
Wrist1   : Jaded electrum bracer AC:2 Wis:0 HP:10 Mana:10
Wrist2   : Ivory Braclet AC:0 Wis:0 Agi:3 Mana:20
Arms     : Bronze AC:8 Wis:0
Hands    : Spit Paw Gloves AC:4 Wis:2 Dex:3
Sholders : Frozen Mantle AC:6 Wis:0 Mana:10
Chest    : Sarnak Emblasened Tabard AC:14 Wis:0 HP:10 SvP:10
Back     : Ringmail Cape AC:6 Wis:0
Waist    : Thick Leather Apron AC:8 Wis:0
Legs     : Ringmail Pants AC:7 Wis:0
Feet     : Banded Boots AC:6 Wis:0
Shield   : Testament of Vanear AC:0 Wis:10 Mana:10

Totals AC:67 Wis:26 Mana:50
(Int:6 Agi:3 Dex:3 SvP:10 HP:20)

I guess that some things are obvious like improving the Face Arms Back
and Boots, but what to change to ?

Oh I'm a Dwarf so my STR is ok, but even with the +26 wis it is only
130-ish.
And my weapons are *really* bad, not even worth mentioning, so what
could I look for in my primary hand ?

Thanks to careful play I don't agro much so don't get hit often so ac is
not my main concern.

Where to hunt ideas would be good too, Loio is getting dull.

Any cules willingly taken.

Jim Monk
