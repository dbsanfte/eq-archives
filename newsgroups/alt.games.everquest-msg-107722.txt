I haven't been in a FFA group in ages, and I wouldn't really even consider it
any more.  Means to me people haven't learned to relax and trust each other
a little, and do the most efficient thing.   One person loots it all, sells the
sellables
and then splits the cash at the end, you NBG high end items that someone
will use and then roll off the rest of the valuables as a single roll, take
turns
picking what you want plan.  This is fast, simple, and fair (with the exception
of the NBG part, which isn't necessarily fair as its possible to only camp
places where items you need drop) and its rare that anyone even thinks of
asking what the loot plan is, in my experience groups in the high 50s all simply

assume that this is how its going to work.  The question "who wants to ML"
is the sum total of discussion on this issue.
