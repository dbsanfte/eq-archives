The problem with your analogy is that in the case of the "media",
quite a few of the more vocal customers will then start whining about
how "stationX (or newspaperX) cares more than stationY".  Since this
is an industry that thrives on attention, and thus venerates it and
seeks always to gain it, these customers will get noticed (especially
by competitors), and, well, you know what happens next.  It's as if
grocers had to compete solely on the basis of the variety and quantity
of Hamburger Helper, Spaghetti Os, and Macaroni and Cheese they stocked.

Nope, none of us <need> 12-hour introspectives.  But some of us demand
them, and incredible though it may seem many others think they're
appropriate.  In fact, as far as I can tell, a majority of the TV
industry's custmers expect it.  So just put the ol' boobtube on ignore
for a day, or a month, or a year, or ...

Kaev <--- who will never forget the shock he felt one year ago today...
