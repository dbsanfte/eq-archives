Yeah I know. But lootwhoring has a logic of its own - a not very
polite, mature one, but there is a reason behind it.

When someone acts completely irrationally, though.. I mean that mage I
mentioned KNEW she would be dumped on by the entire server for doing
what she did, and she should have known that even if she got the piece
by ninjalooting no one was going to help her finish it after that.

Or maybe she didn't, she was darn noob for a high 50s. *shrug*

It was just an idea. :-p
