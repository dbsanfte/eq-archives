Ooops, foot in mouth.

You cannot pull an LDoN solo, thats true. However, you can easily get a 
couple people who aren't busy to group with you for a few minutes so you 
can get the LDoN, then drop the group so you can go solo the mission itself.

While this used to be a bit annoying to do, because you'd need someone 
in zone in order to invite them, it became trivial to do now that you 
can invite across zone lines.  Surely you have two friends or guildmates 
who don't happen to be grouped at the moment?  Particularly people who 
like to solo tend to know others who do.

As a cleric isn't really one of the classes likely to solo LDoN's as 
anything but a serious challenge, I'm not too surprised you didn't know 
this.  I just advise, when seeing someone post something that 
contradicts what you think you know, that you put your response in the 
form of a question rather than a statement of fact.  It will make it 
easier for you to learn, rather than be contradicted.
