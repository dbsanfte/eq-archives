For future reference, scroll to the part of the chat window that shows what
happened, /report name-of-offending-player, /petition explaining briefly
what the problem is, wait until you are contacted.  By all means keep
playing in the meantime, if you can.  When contacted by a guide, explain
what happened, tell him you did the /report, and what name you reported, and
most likely, the situation will be resolved, and quite possibly said
offending player will have a warning placed on his account.  As I recall,
this is a bannable offence, the offending player could even lose his EQ
account for doing that.  There are idiots out there who get their jollies
out of tormenting newbies, he sounds like one of them.
