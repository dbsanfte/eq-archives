  I haven't had any experiences with Ellishae.  What problem, in particular,
were you having with the boats?  I believe there is still a problem with the
Bloated Belly "tossing" people off the deck on the first turn after the boat
leaves the ogre outpost dock in TD.  If this is the sort of problem you were
having, there really isn't anything a Guide can do for you.  It's impossible
for them to verify, and even though it's a "known bug" (at least to me,
since I've experienced it more than once), it's an intermittent sort of
thing, so the best any Guide can really tell you is "Sorry, try again."
Which is a frustrating thing to hear when you've already been knocked off a
boat once and are forced to wait, but I think it's all they're really
empowered to do, if they strictly follow the procedures/rules laid out for
them.  Though a "nicer" Guide who isn't as worried about following the
letter of the law might help you, most Guides won't risk getting thrown out
of the program to help.

  If the boats were completely broken, however (as in, they weren't running
at all), this is something that a Guide should be able to verify and help
you with.  If this was the case, she did indeed do her job poorly.

  The experience I've had with most Guides/GMs on Firiona Vie have been
positive (or neutral), that is, when I get a timely response to my petition
(which usually I don't).  Except one time I got a response to my petition
from a GM who gave me outright incorrect information regarding TLC (she told
me that EVERY item should be subject to TLC, including non-magic/non-lore
items... everything from rusty broadswords to ruined cat pelts, which is
obviously incorrect.)  One Guide that everyone seems to like is Thrads,
though unfortunately you can't pick and choose who you get to answer your
petitions... you're lucky if they're answered at all.  However, one of my
friends says when he does have to petition, he mentions that Thrads was
helping him with his problem before, and asks to be referred to him.  I
don't know how well that works. :P
