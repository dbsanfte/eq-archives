1) Single spectre in Feerrott may be possible
2) Hulking Golras in Tim Deep may be possible (may have cold resist) and 
stay away from Halara!  She's level 40
3) Group in Rathe mtns for HGs (good cash)
4) Solo in the Overthere
5) If you don't mind killing ogre faction, start/join a bouncer group in 
Feerrott
6) If you don't mind killing some dwarf faction, dorfs in BB
7) Cargo Clockwork in Steamfont
8) Perhaps gnome guards in Steamfont (not sure)
9) Perhaps Freeport guards (corrupt version but kills EFP and WFP faction)

Hope these help!
