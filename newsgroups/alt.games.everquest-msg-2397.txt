I agree completely.  There have been a few times over the years where a
relatively  insignificant code change that I tried to slide in with a larger
fix actually ended up causing *big* issues and ultimately had to be backed
out post haste.  When something like that happens, you get much better
faction with your user community when you fess up to the mistake rather than
trying to play 'dodge the issue'.
