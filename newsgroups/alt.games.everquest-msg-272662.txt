    Well, I can now, since the quest was taken out of game as of yesterday. 
:-)

    The Drape of Firiona quest (part of the lead-in to the new expansion) 
worked like this: get four ground spawns (two in Butcherblock, two in 
Greater Faydark). Hand to NPC in Felwithe A. He gives you an item for NPC in 
Felwithe B. Turning in that item starts a quest dialogue, at the end of 
which you get an item for another NPC in Felwithe A. Hand to her, get an 
item for the first NPC in Felwithe A, who gives you a Drape of Firiona:

SHOULDER - MAGIC, LORE
AC: 12
DEX: +7 WIS: +7 INT: +7 AGI: +7 HP: +45 MANA: +40 ENDUR: +40
SV FIRE: +7 SV COLD: +7 SV MAGIC: +7
Required level of 40.
WT: 1.0 Size: SMALL
Class: ALL
Race: ALL
Slot 1, Type 7

    I did the quest for my enchanter, then realized, hmm - the NPC in 
Felwithe B gives you the note as a result of saying a quest phrase. I wonder 
if I needed to hand in the ground spawns for the quest phrase to work?

    No, I didn't.

    So now, all it takes to get a fairly nice item is running around 
Felwithe a bit. Cool! Wait, this item is droppable and the last turn-in NPC 
is maybe 10-15 units from the Felwithe Tribute Master - I wonder how much 
tribute it's worth? 125? Not bad! But, an item usually has tribute roughly 
equal to its sale price... 118 pp with 90 CHA. Ruh-roh!

    I had a guildmate time me. Just under 110 seconds to run, with level 47 
SoW, from the first NPC until I got a Drape (so a full circuit for someone 
exploiting the quest). That included time to zone from A to B and back to A. 
I didn't use any tricks to shorten the time, like binding at the Felwithe B 
NPC or creating a quest phrase hotkey. Assuming it would add 25 seconds onto 
my trip to also sell and bank the result after each circuit, you're still 
looking at over 3000 pp per hour from a very automated process. I was 
tempted to get the level 1 high elf paladin I was using to demonstrate the 
error full store-bought plate before asking the GM to look into it, but I 
was worried he might log before I was done. So I did my good deed for the 
day!
