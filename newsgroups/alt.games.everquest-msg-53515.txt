    The Vox Tail Ale was made to be doable before anyone knew how undoable
it was, which was a Verant first. The quest to get it was discovered AFTER
Vox Tail Ale was put on merchants, but before the warrior epic had been
completed. And it involved getting a scale off Faydedar, the sea dragon so
rare they needed to make him triggered for the druid epic.
