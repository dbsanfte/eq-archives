All they are are a log of warnings on your characters mostly. They
need to track those somehow, right? You're not going to get suspended
on a first offense for most things (exploits, etc). They're there to
referrence if you've been warned before about doing something wrong.

Secondary use is to track name change requests and "good deeds" that
warrant GM notice.
