In the last 4 years I've taken a few month+ breaks thinking I might leave,
but I always come back <sigh>.  I'm glad there are others out there :)

Most characters can solo the early levels these days - those levels are
MUCH easier than they used to be.  Also, if you want to find groups in
the teens and early 20's you can go to Paludal Caverns - You'll find
plenty of folks there, with all the good and bad things that implies.

The Bazaar is going to allow you to find much better gear than you ever
dreamed of in your previous time in EQ, and incredibly low prices.

Another source of help is the serverwide chat channel that folks from this
group frequent.  type /join serverwide.age:age to join it.  Then, if it's
the first chat channel you've joined use /1 to talk in it.
