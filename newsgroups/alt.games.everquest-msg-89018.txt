I'm really liking different groups these days. All-caster is definitely a
powerful one, but not all to well for dungeon crawling.

If you do want to try it , I'd suggest Mage/Necro/Chanter/Druid. Although
the chanter isn't a necessity it sure helps the druid and mage keep up the
killing and he's a boon against adds.
This group can get to 50, even 60, at an amazing pace I think. You don't
need equipment that bad, and most what you want you can buy (groups like
this hunt fast and can net huge amounts of plain pp of sold items.. druid is
key here for fast cash conversion).

And if your friend (really) wants a bard, take it instead of the chanter.
