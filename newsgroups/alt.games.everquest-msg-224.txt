I dont know why I didnt get the main message that this person replied to,
but I'l reply to both senders here.

No, I mean something obvious, like KopKillah or some really lowbrow stuff
like that. A anme like Notwen wouldn't be noticed without really looking
into it.

Kewldoods come to no one's aid. That's why they're so disliked.

Yes, there is a difference between kewldoods and people with creative yet
whimsical names. The guild members will discern between them. A good rp
group wouldn't be associatd with the kewldoods anyway, so they wouldn't care
if a  kewldood was blacklisted

This is Verant's fault, and  I  harped  on them  since the beginning of
phase 2 beta to incoroprate a post office type system,  so people could
communicate with each other , even if the receiver was offline. Yet, as
with every egoswollen company, they ignored the suggestion, and we have
unrealistic guildsends. Unfortunately, this is the only method to speak with
other  guildmades, so it will have to be the exception to  the rule.

If  you cant handle a  train in a  certain  zone,  you really  shouldn't be
there anyhow. Its simple. Its just like the tourist who comes to new  York
City  and goes to a restaurant  in a bad neighborhood. You  shouldn't  have
been there,  you should have asked  someone before you went.  If something
happens, you're the  only one to blame.

 And are they gonna turn /auction off, too?  Come to

The  only method of communication cut off would be the shout channel, to to
its irrelavancy. Auction unfortunately would have to  be the other exception
to the rule. There's not much to  be done when the developers spent more
time  concerend with graphics  than game design.

Poweleveling will not be tolerated. I say discouraged because  everyone has
a different view of what powerleveling is.  Any form of powergaming will  be
frowned upon and if  continued after warning,  the person will be dismissed
from the  guild.

That's why you set up  people to hunt  and with people at their levels, so
they can grow together. Maybe you haven't noticed, but there is no finality
to this  game. What's the rush for?

Once again, hunting parties will be set among the guild, based  on groups
of levels where all members can profit from the  experience  and the  skill
improvement.

No, actually I  haven't  tried the other  guilds. I havn't  enough faith  in
what's  out there to attempt such. I'll start from scratch.

Well,  they are  immnsely  hidden then,  and have been since the final
release came out.  The  majority of  players seem to be  only involved with
getting the strongest gear and the best spell. What happens after they
achieve their goals? I really  would like to  know... they must  get bored
quickly.

Once again, nope. Just tired of seeing EQ overrun with  Quakers.

Everyone  has an opinion,  I suppose. This one, however, is one I shall not
take to heart.
