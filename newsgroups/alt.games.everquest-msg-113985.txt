Writing to Everquest? You don't have to email anyone to cancel an account.
All you do is fire up the game and when you get into the login screen, hit
account. There will be a cancel button there. Hit that. It'll ask you to
confirm. Once that's done, you have until the next billing date to play play
play. After that, you can no longer log in and you will not be charged.
Simple as that.
