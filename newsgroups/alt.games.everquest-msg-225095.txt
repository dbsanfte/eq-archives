Bwahahaha....i worked for a large <coughstatefarmcough> insurance 
company doing customer service...you would not *believe* what normal, 
nice *honest* people would try to get away with...of course this doesnt 
include the yutz who upon getting a quote for insurance from me as 
having a clean driving record decided to buy the policy...i guess he 
totally forgot the 30 minute, 3 police car high speed vehicle chase on 
his record from 2 months before...

Just little things...the guy who sank his own speedboat in front of 
people willing to testify against him...the person who sold off building 
materials from his contractor and told him that it was stolen off the 
property. Caught that transaction on a security cam the contractor 
installed on the building site...*oops* and innumerable people calling 
in from the garage to add certain coverages and trying to get the repair 
work done ... and wondering why the claim was denied [with a police 
report dated prior to coverage, no recourse...]
aru
<though i have also seen claims adjusters really trying to eke out as 
much money for peoples claims they can manage...it does go both ways>
