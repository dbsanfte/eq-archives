Only listening to specific sources.   As you said, the only people you've
talked to about UO are people who left the game for EQ.    (Several people
who have quit EQ pass through here, I doubt they describe the game, or any
improvements thereto in particularly glowing terms.)

Similarly, only reading places where it's just plain not commented on.  If
nobody discusses the game wherever the hell it is you go, then obviously
you're not going to hear about any improvements to it.
