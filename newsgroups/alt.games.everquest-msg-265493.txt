Like its hard to scout most schools. (Some schools sure, especially high 
security innercity ones, but from a terrorists point of a view a schools 
a school and there's no shortage of ones you can just walk in, and take 
the 'long' way to the office...)

And firehalls... who's going to bomb firemen? That makes no sense from a 
terrorists point of view either. You bomb innocent civilians to create 
terror, you don't bomb folks whose job it is to put their lives on the 
line as it is.

Of course stupid ineffectual kneejerk reactions to terrorism is to 
America what ketchup (or perhaps mayo) is to spam. ;)
