Well, I've avoided doing this for a while, but I was bored and didn't really
feel like playing for the moment, so I checked it out and did it.   Really
pretty interesting to see how much each stat is being modified, and the effect
on your hit points etc.

In my normal AC / HP gear.  Such as it is. ; )   (Meaning pretty good in my
opinion, but the ubers would likely laugh at that idea. :)  )

Accurate except for one detail.  I've included the Vambraces of the Myrmidon
that I will have as soon as I finish reparing my faction enough to turn in the
quest items...  (Sorry, some West Wastes dragons were looking at me funny.
;) ) Currently I'm actually wearing Peerless Dragonspine Vambraces in that
slot.

For the weapons, as many warriors do I carry a few which are appropriate to
different situations.  I use Defiance a lot when I need the armor class and
extra skill points to allow me to connect my hits, but for an experience grind
I will most often swap in a Bloodpoint.   I would probably be better off going
with Defiance and Bloodpoint all the time, but I can't quite bring myself to
give up wielding the Club.  I was there when it dropped off the big turtle
himself, and I've had it for too many long levels now.  It's like an old
friend. ;)
