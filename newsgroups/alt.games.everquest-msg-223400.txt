I've seen the ones with warning done before, and the ones where the Wizzie
shouts, "WIZZIE MASS CASTING HIGH LEVEL MGB TTBP IN FIVE MINUTES!"  And
everyone goes running thinking, "Cool, uber wizzie buff!"  Or heck, even
wizards just going, "MGB Wizard buff!"  Those are pretty funny when folks
are warned and don't stop to *think.* ;)  (Or to make sure they get the
dialogue box.  I still haven't figured out where the toggle is.  Mine's on,
luckily.)

The ones that've been happening on Tunare are totally unannounced, and in
high-density areas.  Those aren't real amusing unless the wizzie intends to
quickly return everyone to PoK.  I could chuckle at once, but they're doing
it repeatedly.
