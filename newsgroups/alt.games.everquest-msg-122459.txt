But what would be the point of going in and ninja looting UBER NODROP
ITEMX and then transferring to escape your rep?  Sure you are no
longer despised despite your actions, but you also lost your ill booten
gottie.  Far better to A*hole your way to riches and then change your
name to Nobodywouldgroupwitmenomore on your original server,
where you can now have your cake and eat it too.

Of course personally I can only think of one person on Morell Thule
with a reputation so bad that this would be a good plan... reputation
is overrrated I think, although perhaps there are more people who
are a*holier than thou at heart but have avoided acting out their
worst impulses out of  fear of rep, and this will bring them relieve
from restraint.
