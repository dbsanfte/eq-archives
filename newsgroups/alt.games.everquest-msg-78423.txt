I'm currently a very new level 4 Ranger. In the guides I've seen it
says I should have the foraging skill at level 3, I don't see it. How
come? Don't know if it matters but I'm playing a Half Elf.

Now when I get such a thing, how the hell do you make hot keys the
guide is a piece of Sleleton dung. I see you can move the skills you
have (buttons) to the main screen which is nice but making new ones is
a mystery.
