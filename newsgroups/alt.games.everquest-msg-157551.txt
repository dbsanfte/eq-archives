Heh... VI did it right this time it looks like. They appear to be using MP3
files for the music for various cities at least. Im now wondering if Icould
replace the default MP3's with some more "robust" MP3's.....

Highway to Hell comes readily to mind as an anthem for Neriak...

And Mummers Dance ( Lorena McKennit(sp?)  ) for Kelethin :)
