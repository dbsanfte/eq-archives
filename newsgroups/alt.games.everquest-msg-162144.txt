Nice try, but the Bard littany against nerfing is that we are balanced,
there is no need to improve us, focus your attentions on other classes.

See, if you claim that you're nerfed, then some kind dev may take a look and
find stuff you've been hiding.  It's best to make yourself an uninteresting
target.

Of course, bards also have the advangage that it's likely that no dev
understands how to play a bard effectively, so they're afraid to open that
black box.
