You seem to have difficulty connecting thoughts in sequence.  If anything,
the Palestine has been engaging in "manifest destiny" practices.  They
believe that it is the destiny of muslims to inhabit all of asia minor, and
those pesky jews keep getting in the way.  You'll notice that �Q� pointed
out that the palestinians are attacking civilian targets, while Isreal is
attacking military targets.  Which one has the moral problems?  How exactly
does attacking enemy combatants of a force that attacked you qualify as
manifest destiny?
