As long as you run in the daytime, youll be fine. The only mobs that can 
be a threath to you are a random walking DE (used in druid and ranger 
epic), but im not sure hes aggro, dont aggro on druids (before we do the 
quest, if someone shout that hes inc to one of the zones, make sure your 
e NOT at the zone when he get there), and the hut with the DEs where the 
general for rogue epic spawn. Theyre up all day too, and are NASTY, but 
wont give you problems unless you get too close. If you get too close, 
youll never even know what hit you, some of the HT, and i seen a log 
file of a poor level 50+ who were AFK at the zone line when someone 
trained them there, took 1700+ dmg in 2 sec flat, not counting HT.
