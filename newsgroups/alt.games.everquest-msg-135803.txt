You might be right.  But when I saw the command, my spider sense
told me there was something more useful about it than it appeared.
Someday I need to get that looked at.

Note, the subject is strategies, not exploits... a fine line I'll grant, and I
did think that some of the uses might be though of as exploits, but I'm
damned if I can think of one now that I work on it.  Still, there are
tens of thousands of people with access to the ability and CoH, so
there's lots of devious minds out there trying to find a way.

Which means your mage and wizard had to leave their groups, wizard
had to be leader of new group.  Then he has to get CoH back, and
rejoin his original group.  If he was leader of his original group (and
wizard as leader is a good plan in general, since he can do the
port around and invite people so as to port them back thing, and
invite stragglers at raid end for port out) then the original group has
to reform or drop two members out.

While this isn't crippling, is there an easier way using makeleader?  Dunno.

Think strategies instead of exploits.

Assuming you are in group with the mage already, but noone thought
that monk (who sometimes has to quit out to clear aggro) should be
leader.  Now they can make you leader on the fly, and then revoke
that leadership to a wizard on the fly so he can go fetch someone
from thirty zones away... look for uses of the new ability to simplify
your life.

The particular angle I was thinking of was the ability to chain invites,
so A invites B and makes him leader, then B goes to C, invites
him and makes him leader, then C goes to D and invites him
and makes him leader.  Thus A and B get grouped although they
are widely seperated.

Where can we use that sort of ability to make life easier?  Not
that there wouldn't be a workaround that we've been using
all along, but are there cases now where we can do things
without having to disband and regroup?

I already had my druid friend fail to see the simpler, more
obvious utility of the ability.  We were grouped, someone
else was leader.  Someone who wanted to join us logged
on, up on the moon.  She disbanded to go get them.  Like
she's had to since time immemorial... but no longer has
to, instead we could have made her leader on the fly, and
if there was some reason the original guy should be leader,
why she could give it back when her chore was done.
