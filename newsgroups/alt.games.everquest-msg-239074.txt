Dude, do you have any idea what an ad-hominem is?

You argued some points.  You were then confronted on them, at which time you
confessed that you didn't know the specific facts behind your assertions.
He then, in a belittling fashion, made the point that you're making
assertions without knowing what you're talking about, *which you admitted
yourself*.  Yes, it was belittling, but God damn, he's right.  You didn't
know what you were talking about yet you decided you could berate people
over it nonetheless.

Ad-hominems are when he calls you a child molester or a poopyhead, presuming
that you're *not* actually a child molester, or someone with a head made out
of poopy, *and* that it's not relevant to the discussion.
