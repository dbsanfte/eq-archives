Yes, it is, since you're trying to equate level to game skill and knowledge.

Considering the number of completely clueless level 50+ characters I've seen,
you having a level 52 druid doesn't prove anything to me except that you've
managed to find the snare button, the root button, the DoT button, and the sit
button.

I haven't shown any "evidence" of my game skill and knowledge, as there is no
such thing which is not readily apparent.  Any posting of levels or equipment
would simply be percieved as bragging, or disputed by calling it a lie.  What
am I going to do, invite you to my server so you can come talk to me and see
it?  Heh.  I don't care about this, or you, enough to bother.

Lets just say I'm sufficiently high level enough to be experienced, I group
with both rangers and druids often, and with both in the group, generally our
rangers handle snare aggro better than the druids.   Perhaps I just know
several high quality rangers.  But they are still better at it.
