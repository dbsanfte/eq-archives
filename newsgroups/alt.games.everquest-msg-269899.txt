Yes -- at least until the item you want isn't profitable to make
or the item you want is too costly to buy and allow you to be
profitable.   That's where EQ2 is *right now.*

"Acquire it yourself" means buy it from someone else -- you
CAN'T make it yourself, at least after obtaining a decent
level.   The tradeskill merchants don't sell everything.  EQ2
*forces* player interaction, especially on tradeskills.  You
can go out and kill things perfectly well without some classes
(like scouts, for instance) or even solo.  You can NOT
"solo" tradeskills, at least after you need components from
other players skilled 11+...
