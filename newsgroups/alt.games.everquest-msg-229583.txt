I think pretty much everyone here can agree that the original EQIM produced by
SoE was rubbish.  I have been waiting nearly a year for someone to come up with
a replacement and its finally happened!

http://teqim.sourceforge.net/

TEQIM is a free opensource plugin for Trillian Pro.  Although it was only
released earlier this month, I have been using it for a week now with no
problems.

They also have a couple EQIM variants such as a console EQIM client and some
kind of EQIM IRC interface.  I haven't used either of those however.
