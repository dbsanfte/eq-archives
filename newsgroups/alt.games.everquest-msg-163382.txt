Did I say I had a problem reading such a post?  I don't recall such.
I recall saying that I consider top posting the most logical and that
it show the sequence of posting better.  I choose top posting for such
reasons.  Not because of the newsreader or the style that I have to
read.  Top posting makes the most sense to me.  You can post the way
you choose and even though it's not my prefered method, I respect your
decision to use bottom posting or even interspaced.  It's just not the
form I choose.
