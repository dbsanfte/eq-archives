You might be having trouble finding it in your local games shops, I had to hunt
around a little and this was in big stores in a city, for some reason some
places dont stock these MORPG's after initial release copys are sold out and
you'll never find them in the bargain bin. In fact the only reason i did find
it was because they just released a new compilation edition,(got a metallic
Iksar in there :) i've never seen a copy of the original EQ, AC or UO on sale
in the shops. Anyway, buy it online from sony or amazon or someplace if youre
having trouble.
