Maybe for a mage, I can't really think of any other class out there
that spends a lot of time worrying about agro when soloing. It's a
rare solo player that knows how to assist or control agro. 

There are a few skills that translate from soloing to grouping,
charming and learning how to pull being the obvious ones but the
downside of having a soloist in your group almost always outweighs
those benefits. 

Mages and Druids tend to be the worst imo. Soloing mages are just too
damn scared on overpulls. It's something that they're just not used to
dealing with and they have a bad tendency to gate or run at the
slightest hint of an overpull. Druids are also bad because they tend
to use entirely different skills when soloing as compared to grouping.
A good grouping druid is a wonderful thing, a good soloing druid is a
weak ass wizard-wannabe.
