Sorry. :-)

I attempted to correct myself in a follow-up post (can't edit Usenet).

My initial reply was based on the fact that the poster wanted to start
a "melee" class. 

I personally consider song twisting (juggling) to be more of a Caster
skill, than a Melee skill. It requires timing, careful planning, and
an indepth knowledge of how each song functions. I have leveled a Bard
to 32 (before my wrists gave out), and their is absolutely no
comparison to the simple button mashing of a Monk or Warrior. I wanted
to get that point across to the original poster.

I certainly meant no disrespect, and I appologize for spreading
misinformation
