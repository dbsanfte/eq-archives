The armor is gold in color, he does not know the name of the quests, there is a
full set of armor available for clerics that is questable.  Bracers of the
Reverant are part of it.  Look up quests in Temple of Sol Ro and then under the
cleric quests, each piece has some name like Reverant etc. in it's name.
