Are you using a drum?  Your skill will only be checked against singing
unless you're holding the instrument.  You should check a few of the guides
online (eq.castersrealm.com) about swapping instruments and weapons.

You can easily maintain your proficiency in all of them, 1hs, 1hb, 1hp.  At
later levels, you can dual-wield and this will get easier.  Only problem for
me was the weight overload -- I was carrying a bunch of weapons and
instruments with bronze armor (*sigh*)

I think somewhere along the way, my lvl 20 bard was wielding a crookstinger
and staff of writhing (GLS quest and a lot of good trades).  I was proccing
something fierce.

Dunno, the few pieces of gold you get from the quest isn't really worth
working out.
