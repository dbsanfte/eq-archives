Did you get Shadows of Luclin?  Added zones for levels 1 to 60.  Two of the
three expansions for EQ added new zones for levels 1 to 60.  One of the
expansions added zones for 30+.  As for new freebie zones, those have
probably favored the higher level players, I don't honestly know which of
the zones other than Warrens and Stonebrunt and the Planes (I think), were
free add ons.
