So you are saying I was responding from class envy?  You do know that I
play a both druids (45 & 31 currently) and clerics (51 & 15 currently)
among other classes (including paladins) right?  I mean its in my posts,
I don't just talk about the classes like some folks, I actually play
them.  When I said that cleric is the best I meant it, though of course
personal opinions such as whats best are going to vary, which is what I
prefaced my remarks with.  Now if you really do play a pally, which is
seriously in doubt based on how little you actually seem to know about
the class, stick to talking about pallys cause you don't seem to know
much about druids or clerics either.
