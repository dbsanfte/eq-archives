My highest character is a 57 enc and I have a lot of alts.  I don't sell my
gear or loot, I pass it down.  Soooo, after 3 years and 57 levels, my
enchanter has a whopping 6,000p in cash.

They're doing it for cash because only those who love to go to EC and do the
buy/trade/sell-thing have a hell of a lot of cash...the rest of us have to
do something else if we want quick cash.  Giants on the Old World drop a lot
more cash than they're worth.

Personally, I'll do other stuff for cash, lately it's been slaughtering
goblins in Droga for cash, items, and salts/skins (for my chardok mule).  I
don't make a whole lot...about 100p per hour, but I have fun beating on
stuff again (have epic, will melee <g> ).  Money is nothing like the Giants,
but I also don't have do deal with the hassle of competition and whiny
30-somethings.
