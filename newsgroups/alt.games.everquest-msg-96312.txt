Precisely.

Kunark gave us lots of good zones but when it comes to dungeons...

Crystal Caverns
Tower of Frozen Shadow.

Both in Velious. Two of the best in the game. CC might be too crowded,
ToFS never is but requires someone get keys. Other than that, they
both stand as about ten times better places to fight than OT and DL
(Karnors isn't a problem, its a symptom, its where all the DL noobs go
after they're done and they just don't know what to do in a dungeon.
KC itself is pretty well designed.)

If your computer can handle it Luclin has some real fun dungeons in
that level range as well, though once again too many people stay
outside in Dawnshroud (Luclin's version of OT) and Maidens Eye (much
like a souped up DL).
