They don't roam.  But the nice thing about spectres is that they use proper
capitalization when typing.

Here's a lesson:  no one owes you a warning.  If you're hit with a spectre
once, that sucks.  If you're hit with one again, why aren't you paying
attention to what's happening around you?  Why are you asking for trouble?
Do you know what a spectre sound like?  If you've ever been hit by one, next
time you hear the noise run like hell and hope that he attacks the new guy
who doesn't know yet.

It's YOUR responsibility to be not hit by a train.  It's damned nice when
you get warning but nothing is OWED to you.

NEVER fight around the dock because morons like to pull giants and spectres
to it to escape...thinking that the level 12s at the dock can do something
they can't.  Sheah.  And if my level 56 is there waiting on the barge?
Well, depends on if I'm in a good mood or not...I may just watch the
slaughter and laugh at the morons who /shout "who trained the <xxxx>?"
Believe it or not, this really really stupid thing is STILL said in level
50+ zones.

NEVER hunt around the lake unless you're willing to take a chance at being
hit by a spectre.
