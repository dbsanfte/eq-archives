I haven't purchased it yet, but was wanting to make sure no problems before
I did.  I've been told by someone in game that it is compatable, they
claimed to have been using one at the moment (last night).
    I'm running Win98SE with DX8.1 installed.  I've got two 128MB of RAM
(256 total) and am going to add another 256MB.  I've heard Win98SE doesn't
have anything special needed to be done for 512, only higher.
