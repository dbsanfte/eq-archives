A lot of the guilds on FV are RP-friendly or RP-intensive or simple 
casual enough that you don't need to destroy your RL to be a member of 
'em.  Where are you hunting, by the way?  I think I'd wandered over to 
Paludal Caverns via Shadeweaver's Thicket during that level with my 
Iksar Beastlord.  The tunnels can be a bitch, especially if you've 
gotten the Gor Taku mad at you, but once you're through, you should have 
a good time with the mud burrowers and the littlest mushrooms and be 
level 9 and with your tiger in almost no time.  :)

If you haven't already, check out the FV message board 
(http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie).  And if you see a 
despondent-looking Iksar hanging about the area by the name of Mudfish, 
don't be shy.  (He doesn't speak Vah Shir, though, despite having lived 
at Shar Vahl for 16 levels now.)
