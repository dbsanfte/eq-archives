It's pretty easy to see why nobody likes it. First, thanks to Verant's
programmers forgetting about that z-axis thing, maybe you've heard of it,
you can be aggrod on and attacked from a variety of places you cannot see =)
If you get really unlucky, you could aggro a mob deep in the dungeon that
swims up to you bringing the entire zone in front of you with it.  There's
bad pathing, if you happen to trigger a mob you didn't mean to, even one
that is fairly close, you could be facing an assload of them very soon.
People don't like needing to have a spell cast on them every X minutes just
so they can live.  Not sure what decent stuff you're talking about, the loot
is no good compared to Kunark and Velious. It's kind of a pain to get to,
since everyone is going to be on Kunark or Velious, you have to get druids
and/or wizards to go to everyone.  Basically the only thing it's good for is
uberguild powerleveling.
