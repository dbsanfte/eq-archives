    Dunno about fatal flaws..... sounds like a lot of fun to try :)

    But what about fearing the king first instead of his pet? Then you could
whack his pet and shammy (shammy first I suppose) and intercept him with
possibly a nearly dead pet when he comes back. King wastes his HT on pet
then you can fear him again or snare then fear maybe?
