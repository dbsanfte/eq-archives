With a clarity, I can *almost* kill one. I had one one night, he was under 
a quarter of life, rooted DoTed and ensnared, and I had enough mana for 
another Creeping Crud or root. That's when the ghoul popped on my poor 
medding druid.

It's better than clarity when you think about it, especially for DoT-
rotting mobs. If my DoTs, snares, and roots take 33% less time to 
cast(Affliction Haste), I can med an extra tick after casting one. If they 
last 20% longer, they do 20% more damage. If they cost 25% less mana to 
cast, I am now using <75% of my old casting cost to do 120% of my old 
damage. So my spell got 45% more efficient.

Between this and the new pet rules, Necros are going to *own* soloing.

Add to the damage bonus the fact that you can cast more of them, and 
quicker... Wow. The game just got easier for the well-equipped caster.

10% mana savings, 20% damage bonus, 15% casting haste... 

Spell X does 100 damage for 100 mana and has a cast time of 20 (for this 
example)

Spell X with full gear costs 90 mana, does 120 damage, and casts in 17.

So in 34 seconds(no resists, fizzles, etc.):
Old Spell - Casts 17 times, doing 1700 total damage and costs 1700 mana
New Spell - Casts 20 times, doing 2400 total damage and costs 1800 mana

Or, with 1000 mana:
Old: 10 times, 1000 damage, 20.0 seconds.
New: 11 times, 1320 damage, 18.7 seconds. With 10 mana to spare.

I am a happy man... I have an inventory of all my gear (hey, med time 
sucks) and it turns out I have the stuff I need for Mana Preservation 1 and 
2, Enhancement Haste 1, Affliction Efficiency 1 and 2, and Extended 
Affliction 2 on my Druid. One or two of these are coming off another 
character, but soon I will be rigged for bear. Hell I might even start 
playing my druid more now that I can (probably, I'll let you all know 
in a day or two)solo an SG.
