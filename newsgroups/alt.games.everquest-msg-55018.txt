  Sounds fair enough.  Just give me enough time to 
level my mage up to a respectable level first.  I 
hit level 8 a day or so ago, and have been flying
through mobs since I got my new spells.

Annie   <--- Also flew threw my husband's level 9
             bard...with 75% mana, and my pet at
	     97% health at the end.  Also, is noticing
             more reluctance on his part to accept        
             duels from her, for some reason.
