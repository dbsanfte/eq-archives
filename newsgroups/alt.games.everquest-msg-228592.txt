Well, the next expansion should be interesting when it comes to PvP.  Here's
what they had to say about it a little while ago:

    It is time to officially take the wraps off our next big project,
    codenamed "Frontiers". This is Dark Age of Camelots long-awaited RvR
    overhaul; where we take the lessons weve learned from the last two years
    of RvR combat and make appropriate changes. This will be a free
    expansion, available via download. It is currently scheduled to go into
    a limited beta in February.

    We know that this is a much anticipated update for Camelot, and as such
    we plan to keep the community fully informed about its design and
    development details. There will be no secrets in Frontiers  well make
    all the appropriate information public as soon as we can, so that you,
    the Camelot community, will have plenty of time to make comments, give
    your feedback, and be part of the process.

    There are three overall goals for Frontiers  goals that every design
    decision will be evaluated against. The design goals are:

    - Make RvR combat more accessible  finding battles more quickly. We want
      players to be able to log in, find a battle, and RvR.

    - Add more tactics and diversity through geography, siege/boat warfare,
      expanded keep upgrading options. There will be more disparate places
      to engage in RvR, with more strategic elements.

    - More concrete bonuses and abilities as rewards for RvR  in other
      words, make the awards for RvR more obvious and better presented, and
      make sure that the Realm ability system is well balanced and logical.

    The first big change in Frontiers will be the reorganization of each
    Realms frontier zones into one "region", which means that there will be
    no zoning between the frontiers. This will make it much easier to
    communicate with other players, and to travel from one frontier area to
    another. Each Realms new frontier area will be separated from the others
    by an ocean.

    This is the first in a series of regular updates that well be releasing
    about the Frontiers expansion. In the next update: a map of the updated
    Midgard frontier.

The Midgard map was just posted today.  It looks like there will be some fun
combat possibilities there.
