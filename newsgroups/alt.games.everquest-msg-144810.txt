Hi, I know I'm a little late with my answer but I'm a newbie too and
just subscribed to this ng. In a few days I tried a few of the classes
and I found that most high level players are very helpfull to low
level players.. They take a look at you, give you a few boosts (speed,
armour, HP) and sometimes even a better weapon. 

So, yes, you can run around those experienced players with no trouble
at all :)


Bye! Inky (^_-)
