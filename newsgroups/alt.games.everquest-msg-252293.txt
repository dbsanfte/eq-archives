Yes... you fix Growth faction through the muffin quest. You buy
muffins and turn them in to the npc. The trick is that the npc is kos
to you at the start and won't accept them. Now.. if i recall the
procedure is something akin to this.

1) Get just inside of trade window range which iirc is out of agro
range.
2) Hand 1 muffin to NPC to initiate trade window
3) Druid invis's you.
4) Place 3 more muffins in the window
5) Hit trade.

The trick is that when you are invis you are indiff to the NPC when
you hit trade, and even though hitting trade iirc breaks invis the
check is based off indifferent therefore allowing the quest hand-in to
give you the 4 bumps in faction. Bear in mind this is from memory so i
may be off at points.

When you get the process down you need to optimize window locations
similar to the Erudin quest and have hotkeys setup to communicate with
the druid. Then you just keep repeating the process until you are out
of KoS. After you are out, which you can tell by just conning the npc
you're handing in to, just keep handing muffins in as fast as you can
4 at a time non-stacked. IIRC it took an hour or so of churning with a
druid to get out of KOS and another 2-3 to max the faction.

The muffins themselves are bought around the corner at a merchant.. so
it would be suggested to fix FP faction first, buy a boatload of
muffins on an alt, or have a friend buy them. It typically takes a
couple thousand muffins to max the faction but if you churn it, it is
not only the fastest way, but one of the few ways of fixing it.

Well.. tanking growth faction can be extremely detrimental to a druid
if they do not allready have epic. One of the turn-in NPC's for their
epic is on Growth faction and until its fixed they can't do turn in.
