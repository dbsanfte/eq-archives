You might concentrate on one for a little bit, but dont abandon the
others totally. At this point - you level up fast, but it will slow
down and youll be able to work on them all. Get pretty good at one.
Try to get weapons of the other skills that have the smallest delay
possible, so that when you are using them, youll have more chances at
skill ups.

When you start to hit higher levels, it will be harder to get the
skill ups (dont wait till 50 like i did lol). If im not the MA, Ill
usually ask the others in the group if its ok to work on other melee
skills, but if we get into a bind, ill switch back to what im good at.
I curse myself for not working on them sooner.
