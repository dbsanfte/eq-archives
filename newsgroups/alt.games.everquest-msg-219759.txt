If you are attacking from the front arc, and do not have an AA that 
changes things, then, no, you do not hit the mob at all when it's 
enraged, every single one of your hits (swings?) is riposted.  This does 
not stop any procs you may have however, so, I suppose if you had a 
seriously high proccing weapon, and the ripsotes aren't that huge anyway, 
you could argue for continuing to hit.
