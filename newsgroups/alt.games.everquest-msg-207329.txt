Wouldn't it make less of a mess to just chat up some Paladin to
come along with ya?  He could heal himself some to reduce the
load on your pet, er, husband, and with any luck he'd tank at
least a little better than you, and you could then dice the mobs
unprotected backsides (no dodge/parry/riposte/block to reduce
your damage output).  I mean, it's clear you enjoy being self-
sufficient with your little duo there, but a little change of
pace now and then couldn't hurt, could it?
