SoTW is now highly over rated. It was great in it's day, I suppose, but
now there's better to be had far more easily. The only quested staff for
wizards anymore, IMHO, is the SoTF which I still carry at level 58.  I
never bothered with that bulky Staff of the Wheel. Just wasn't worth it
for the stats at the time.
