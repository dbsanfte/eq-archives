okay, first you say it won't stack, then later say it will.  My
understanding is that it will stack, but there is a cap.  there are 3 types
of haste.  song haste, spell haste, and item haste.  appearantly there are
items that also act like spell haste and song haste to confuse things some.
there is a max cap, so for the most part you don't need a whole lot of
haste.  most tanks have a 20ish or 30ish haste item, so with a spell haste
of say 50ish, they only need 20 or 30 more from singing.  The reason why
what you said is debunked is because robe of the whistling fist is a song
haste item that stacks with another item and also another spell haste.  it
won't stack with a normal song haste though.  You mentioned the songs that
go over the limit.
I actually have talked to an bard about mixxing slows.  appearantly our
slows also combine, so that you both slow also, but have to be using the
right slows to mix properly.
