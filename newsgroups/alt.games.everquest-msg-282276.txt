	I suggest that optimizing for "no downtime" does NOT (or at least
not always) optimize for XP (or kill) rate.  For instance, I often find
that if I kill slowly enough to never go OOM I can't possibly clear a
camp (with implications for wasted time splitting spawns etc.)  OTOH if
I kill as fast as I can (least time per mob) I can clear the camp even 
though I may need some downtime between groups of kills.  

	Now, as a cleric or warrior, no matter HOW fast or HOW slow
I try to kill, each kill takes more than 50% of my mana and/or HP bar
so no matter WHAT I do (except hunting greens) it means minutes of downtime
per mob.  

	Group dynamics are somewhat different.  IMHO the "fastest"
group kills until the cleric is LOM then the necro pumps him up while
the group takes 60 secs to rebuff or wait for repops.
