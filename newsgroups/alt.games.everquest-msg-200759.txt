To an extent it also leaves out healers, So long as you can survive one 
fight (and not draw adds) anyone can heal-up. It makes everyone a solo 
class, unless you nerf solo xp compaired to group xp :-P

I think I like this better because :
1) It's easy to implement (The first idea relys on being able to 
establish that a character is "not in combat", We all know how strange 
agro can be)

2) There is a definat risk vs reward, you are risking 30 seconds 
vulnerable for the equivilent of 2 mins meditation / regen.

3) The difference between this and the spell book is that it would be a 
choice, either wait in an "active" mode for 2 mins or an "inactive" mode 
for 30 seconds

However the problems are similar to the first idea. In safe single pull

spots it makes every one a soloer. I guess that they would have to add 

either inteligent mobs (that followed, but hid round the corner to jump 

the party while it was resting) or more simply have it increase the 
range at which you generate agro by some large amount. So that near by 
mobs sense that you are resting / vulnrable and come running.

If they could factor in the fact that you were in a group this would be 
good, Like if the whole group (or the one soloer) was resting then the 
agro range is increased 10 fold, but if only 2/6 of the group are 
resting then agro range only doubles. This would simulate some of the 
party guarding the rest. This could make downtime quite interactive :-p

Nothing like this comming in EQ, not sure how it will all work in EQ2.

Anyone heard how it is going to work ?

The problem is that skill in EQ only effect how long it takes you to get 
somewhere (rather than IF you will get there) and Downtime for medding / 
healing is like the carbon rods in a reactor core. They prevent the 
whole system going into melt down (i.e. everyone level 65)
