Nope. See below.

True, almost.

There is a significant difference between an army that is supposed to
protect the homeland from invasion ( which is what most Europeans and
the Japanese for example focus on ) and one that is supposed to
project force in a distant theater of war. 

The US' geographically isolated position and huge war chest ( comming
from their size and their even bigger economy)  has allowed it or
forced it if you will to focus it's military on long range projection
of power whereas say Germany is focused on homeland security ( thought
that has been changing since the fall of the USSR ). The difference in
hardware is real and obvious enough to allow for a distinction between
a ( primarily ) defensive force and one that is (primarily) offensive.


On the original question: I don't think that Britains armed forces
qualify as "purely defensive" though. The UK has a strong focus of
projecting power abroad ( aircraft carriers; light, air transportable
units and so on ) .

Cheers!

Chris
