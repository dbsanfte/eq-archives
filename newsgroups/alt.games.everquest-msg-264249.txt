I like EQ2 so far.  The quests are fun and there are alot of them.  I love 
the quest journal.  It does get a bit confusing when you have 100 or so 
quests in your journal at a time.  At least you get credit for more than 
one quest when you have to kill the same thing and have both quests.  Very 
annoying to kill 10 of something then find out you have to kill 10 more for 
another quest.  I do spend alot of time running around talking to NPCs.  I 
make a list of people in the various zones that i need to talk to.  

They will need to add alot more quests in order to keep interest tho.  And 
not just the fedex style ones, those do get old.  I don't think I've done 
all the available quests yet.

They also need to add the promised crafter quests.  The only crafter-type 
quest in the game is when you first start on the newbie isle and some 
people miss doing that one.

IMHO, I don't think EQ2 is ready to be released in November.
