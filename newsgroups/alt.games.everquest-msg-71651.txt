I see what you mean.  Or rather, I see the intent in your words.  You think
me *choosing* to do something that leads to greater enjoyment of the game
somehow implies an incapability to do it the "hard" way.  I won't even
bother to try to disabuse you of that notion if what I have posted prior to
this has not already.  The people that purposefully put on blinders are
generally not worth wasting time on anyway.

I still think you were fantasizing about my penis.  It's ok, really.  I
don't swing that way, but I'm not one to stand in the way of a man's
fantasies.
