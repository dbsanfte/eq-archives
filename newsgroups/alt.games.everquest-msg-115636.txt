   A bit of background first.  My main's a druid just over porting age 
(level 32 and holding), so I usually get annoyed at all the "greedy 
dr00ds suxx0r" threads that pop up here and on various message boards 
from time to time. "I don't know what they mean", I say. "My druid is a 
polite, respectable man about town^H^H^H^H the forest."

   Then I decided to play a couple of my alternates for a while, and if 
the kind of people I ran into were any indication of what everyone else 
has to form an impression of druids from, it's no *wonder* we have a 
reputation as greedy assholes. A couple of examples:

  1.) My necromancer was needing a port down to West Commonlands. Having 
just bought all his level 24 spells, he barely had two platinum pieces to 
rub together. I asked in my server's taxi channel for a port, making sure 
to mention up front that I was broke and I wouldn't be able to pay very 
much at all. 

     A druid answered my request, trotted over, invited me into a 
group...the usual. I went to offer her a third of my available cash 
(about three platinum or so). We sat there for a minute, then she 
canceled the trade, saying "Don't insult me by offering that little."

    Um, what? I was trying to offer her *something* for her time and 
mana. I don't know about anyone else, but I was always told that throwing 
money back in someone's face like that is just rude. She wound up porting 
me anyway, but I was still pretty hacked off.

  2.) My warrior, slightly more well off, needed a port down to Misty 
Thicket from the Nexus, and did the usual "WTB" thing. A druid showed up 
(named "Farmer"--way to roleplay, buddy), invited me, etc..

    I started to hand him 10 platinum, and his response was "Eesh." Me: 
"What?"  Him: "Usual price is 20pp bro"  Me: "Well, if you don't want to 
do it, return my money and I'll go somewhere else."  Him: "I'll do it, 
but I'll remember you next time."  (Ooh, I'm quaking in my blackened iron 
boots...)

   Honestly...it's almost enough to make me go back to playing my druid 
exclusively so I don't have to put up with fuckheads like these.

"I'm sorry, did I offend you just now? Pardon me--I'm
sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Really, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to offend you. Should I like, change my 
attitude? Should I change my whole way of  being? Huh? 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. BITE ME HARD!"
