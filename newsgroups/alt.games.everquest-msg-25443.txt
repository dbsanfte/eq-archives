I agree, as a tank I spend a lot of time dealing out damage, and taking it.
I protect my casters as best as I possibly can.  But if I'm focused on a
mob, and 3 more pop, well then you've got to let me know your getting
hammered by saying something.  Running around like a chicken with your head
cut off only earns you a shout from me to stand still you idiot!  I HATE to
chase my prey.  That is what they make root or snare type spells for.  If
your other casters were just standing there then they weren't doing their
jobs either.  Tanks are not able to do crowd control, we hack & slash, kick,
bash, and taunt.  It is what we were made to do, get in close and hit hard
enough to keep the mob entertained.

You got into a young group.  Sounds like most of them had never been a group
before, or have but with other types of characters.  It happens, even to
higher level characters, you get one with minimal experience in a group.

Don't let one bad experience ruin it for you.
