"Sales of POP are not what they (Sony) thought they would be."

BS. POP is the best expansion to date, sales will pickup once people get off
their asses and either upgrade their gimp computers and do a little research
as to what it actually is and also may I point out it comes with original
EQ< so if you buy it as a new player, you get old world and the Plane of
knowledge, which lets you port around without the nexus scions, or a gay
druid

"People leaving because they can't solo any more"

Wrong
DRUIDS are leaving or making alts

OH boo hoo. Why? Cause verant stuck a bat up their ass and its awesome. They
can no longer use a level 5 <<< FIVE >>> Spell to Harmony and then pull a
entire camp of 45+ fucking OTTER vendors. And oh, we dont need your
ports...bye

Nerf this and that?

What did they nerf? Monk? No thats not a nerf, monks were ridiculously
overpowered and got their come uppance

What else did they nerf? People getting raid xp that didnt own POP? NO IM
SORRY thats called an exploit, and a BUG. Get off your ass and shell out
24.99

And yes, I myslef bought 4 copies
