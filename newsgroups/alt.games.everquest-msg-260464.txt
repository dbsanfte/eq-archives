In order for Runnyeye to match Paludal, the hot spot modifier would need 
to be about +60%, I'd wager that Paludal is still better in the 
appropriate level range.  Runnyeye goes to a higher level overall 
however.

The top xp zones, circa PoP, based on ZEM alone:

160 - Paludal, Crushbone, Befallen
150 - Upper Guk, Krun's Tower, Warrens
130 - Sol A, Unrest
125 - Felwithe, Grobb, Halas, Kaladim, Kedge Keep
119 - Most PoP zones
111 - HoH
100 - Lots of zones
96 - Qeynos Catacombs
90 - Acrylia, Griegs, Splitpaw, Permafrost, Sleepers Tomb, Umbral
89 - Droga, Nurga
85 - Lots of zones
75 - Standard outdoor zone ZEM
65 - The Grey
60 - LoIO
