I was reading at over 730 wmp with 100% comprehension back in the sixth 
grade.  I don't know how much over, because thats as fast as the testing 
machine would go.

I guess its possible that A) My reading speed has dropped, B) that was 
only astonishingly fast at a 6th grade level  with B1) and my reading 
speed didn't keep up with par.

I know it now takes me two or three times as long to read a novel as it 
used to, because I found I enjoyed them more if I took the time to savor 
the nuances.  Still go thru a couple books a day if I'm doing nothing 
but hang out and read.  I-can- still read em in a couple hours, but I 
choose not to.

Based on my circle of friends and family, this doesn't qualify as 
exceedingly slow.  Maybe I just have a slow circle, though:)
