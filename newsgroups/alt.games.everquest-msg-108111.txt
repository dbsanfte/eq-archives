It means you are battling windmills (paranoia).

"Not really accurate?"  Oh, I was wrong about something!  I was wrong, which
means now you get to show everyone how right you can be about something.  Is
EVERYTHING a point of contention with you, Ben?  Is EVERYTHING wrong until
you come and make it right?

Pretending to not care is pretending to not care, although you clearly do
care.  It doesn't matter WHAT you don't care about; my statement was generic
enough to apply to ANYTHING you were claiming to not care about.
Nit-picking on my statement was utterly pointless and got you nowhere;
telling us your opinions will keep coming has zero to do with what I said.

I don't know if you realize this, Ben, but ANYONE can pick out tiny little
nits in anything anyone else says (even make them up) in order to show they
are wrong about something they've said.  Constantly showing how other people
are wrong means you are either taking a lot of pleasure out of it, or you're
so terrified of anyone thinking you're wrong about something, you have to
create massive piles of "wrong" on top of everyone else, lest they throw a
stone at your glass house over there.

Ben, you were ENTIRELY abusive to me regarding a whole other discussion.
You used profanity, told me my math teacher needed to be fired and you
called me several names.  Don't EVEN start in with the argument that you
aren't abusive...you are an EXTREMELY abusive person.  If you honestly
believe you aren't, you have a lot of maturing to do.

There's broken logic for you.  A thread changes topic and you think it's
because people care about you.  Definition of a non-sequitur.

Ben, being abusive is being abusive.  If that person was abusive towards
you, and you were a better person than them, you wouldn't be abusive right
back, you would shake your head and realize it must be sad to be them.
However, if you are not a better person, then you simply give tit-for-tat.

But to delve into the issue a little bit, I think you had it coming.  You've
been a genuine tool since I've been around this newsgroup and I knew sooner
or later one or more others were going to start ripping into you.

You can pretend it doesn't matter or that you don't mind people hating you,
but it clearly does matter and if you didn't mind, I don't think you would
be posting here trying to justify why you've been so abusive.

Just...take my advice; I wish no ill-will on you.  Take it down a notch.
Don't argue back at me here to show how wrong I was in my post here, just
take it down a notch and you'll find much less heat on you around here.

What clique, Ben?  This is what I mean by quixotic.  This is more than just
a little paranoid.  There's no group banding together against you or
freezing you out of anything.  This is an open newsgroup and if you notice
several people have the same opinions, maybe that's because the opinion is
warranted.  Perhaps just taking a step back and looking at how you treat
people will make you see that there's no clique, Ben...just people who are
sharing the same opinions about you.

Of course not.
