I agree with just about everything you've written in this thread,
but I must strongly disagree with the above.

Israel has had to endure more barbaric horseshit than any civilized
nation on earth, and responded with greater restraint than any other
nation would be able to muster.

It's shameful for us to try to keep them on a "leash" at all.
After 9/11, especially, we should have the sense to tell them,
"go do whatever you have to do to clean out the viper's nests,
we'll back you 100%".
