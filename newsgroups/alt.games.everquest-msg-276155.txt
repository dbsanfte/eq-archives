Same situation for me.  I remember taking the boat in Qeynos out to
collect greater lightstones so that we could turn them in to the
gypsies.  A friend and I must have collected 20 or so each (man we were
gonna be RICH!).  But the run to the gypsy camp in NK got us both
killed at least once.  Gryphs scared the hell out of me.  And what
about those bandits?  They were everywhere!  I heard that if they kill
you, they hang your corpse up in the trees!

Or how about trying to solo your first mammouth calf?  Oh crap where is
the guard?  No map!  No compass!  Everything looks the same!
