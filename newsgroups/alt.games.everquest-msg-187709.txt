    They put him at a competitive disadvantage compared with people who did
get LoY. In a game that's about competition, that can be mighty annoying.

    That all new features are things you have to pay for. As he said, had
the research books been droppable he would have been happy. But the fact
that they were made No Drop, for no reason other than to make people buy the
extension to get them, was what annoyed him. Especially when this extended
spell research wasn't originally part of the extension, and had been
promised for some time.

    I don't see ALL new features as being tied to expansions. Jaggedpine is
a good example of something we got for free which has been useful to many
people. But the recent trend has been to make all new features something
requiring payment, and apparently that's not acceptable to the OP.
