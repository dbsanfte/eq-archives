And it still gets it's ass handed to it on a platter if it gets agro from
anything that isn't horribly green.

I call it the +6 dps spell when I use it in groups (I don't really know what
the dps on it is, too lazy to parse, but the most useful part is the bashes
on casters), don't bother with any buffs except Savage Spirit (70% haste +
45 ATK + 17 ac).

Very useful for slaughtering green things for faction though.
