    I will agree that these were pretty mild examples of it.  And I do seem
to remember some posts that did go the "FU Verant, I quit and am taking all
23 of my accounts with me!" route.  But I have to admit, I don't remember
where I read them.  Do remember thinking it was pretty funny, though.

   No argument here on that last part.  Except for bards.  They seem to
strangely quiet...

   And to be honest, I don't an overly strong attachment to my definition
of it.  It seems to be a rather subtle matter of a difference of a few
degrees, to me.


> Why do more druids and clerics go anon or role as opposed to other classes?

   Ports, SoW, rezzes and Temp/Aegoism.  Before PoP I would guess that
druids had it worse than clerics, but even then, no one likes eating a
death.

> The dislike of druids seems terribly exaggerated on this newsgroup.

   Not real inclined to argue that one, either.  In fact, I think that
there's a lot that gets exaggerated in this newsgroup.  That's part of the
fun.  But I do know that if one reads the "griefer" boards on various
server community forums, one finds that druids were often mentioned in
other than loving terms.  And there were some that deserved it.  The class,
for a while at least, seemed to be a jerk magnet.  Even given that,
however, I think that the majority of druids were undeserving of this
reputation.
