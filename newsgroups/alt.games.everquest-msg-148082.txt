Just an update.
I was in Howling Stones last night...what a blast!
I had a few higher-level additions to the group (54 cleric, 57
Rogue:)), since the regulars werent on, and we managed to pretty much
breeze through the north and west wings (even with me tanking).
Drops weren't great, a few spells, Theft of Thought being the best,
and some kylong and rusty chain (or something) gear, but the main
objective was to scout around.
I think I can safely say that my regular group would have no problems
in either of the north or west, although we could maybe do with a big
damage dealer.
After being in the basement of KC the night before, I was glad to see
the mobs HPs dropping a lot quicker in Howling Stones :)


Thanks all for the info, I think I may be back there a few more times
over the next few weeks :)


And BTW....there were 25 peeps in the zone last night, mostly higher
level 55+, so it doesnt seem  to be as deserted as everyone claims.
