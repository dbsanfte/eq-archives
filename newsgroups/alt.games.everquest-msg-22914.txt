Win98SE will handle ICS, btw, though Win2k ICS is sweet (don't know about
WinMe)

Cable modem goes into one NIC on his PC and out the other, into a hub that
everyone else plugs into.  Besides sharing (ICS'ing) his second NIC there's
really no configuration needed.

When your friend connects to his cable provider he gets his IP address from
them each time he turns on his computer (using DHCP).  So, no configuration
needed there.

When your friend shares his internet connection using ICS, the other
computers connected to the hub get their INTERNAL address from your friend's
PC...it's all automatic.

If your friend will be doing this on a regular basis you're much better off
with a cheap router.  Linksys and Netgear both have broadband (cable/dsl)
routers in the $100-$150 range.  You can save money buy buying a 2-port
router if you have a hub laying around that you can plug into it to take
care of all the friend's computers.
