Only a gig of ram? I'm surprised. I'd have put 1GB as a minimum for 2 
boxxing, and would suggest 1.5 - 2GB for 4 boxxing. Whats your memory 
utilization like? I presume you are running XP? I guess 2K has a smaller 
os footprint...

Yes I can see how the DVD player would make a substantial difference.

RAID 0 scares me. MTBF divided by 2 :)

Lol... I thought I was /poking fun at the DVD spec... this is even 
better: "Arctic Silver Thermal Epoxy" You felt the need to spec the 
exact adhesives you used!?

I mean sure, don't use duct tape to mount heatsinks to modern CPUs, but 
I'm sure you'll be able to 4 box EQ successfully even if you are less 
discerning about the epoxy you use.

j/k... I love enthusiasts. Cars, computers, model trains... it doesn't 
matter... the hilarious lack of perspective is always the same. :)

The trick to boxxing on a raid is to stay off the key rols... bring DPS 
classes. You don't multibox the ch chain or maintank unless the raid is 
very trivial :)
