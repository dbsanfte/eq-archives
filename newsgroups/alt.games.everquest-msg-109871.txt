Ok I am a 24 Druid. I had good grear for my lvl. I wasn't a twink. I lost my
body a while ago so I got fusterated made a new character. After playing
with my new char, I wanted my druid back. So I am not standing in EC, nekked
with 20pp in my pockets. Where could I go hunt to get some money to buy
crappy gear? I got that 20pp from SoWing someone and binding them. Can
someone tell me where I could hunt with my spells to get ok money and loot
to re-build my druid? Thanks,

-Dylan-
