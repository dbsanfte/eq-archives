    Depends on how "high-level" you mean, but here's some stuff that drops
in The Warrens:

Bracer of the Forlorn: AC 6 WIS 3 INT -1 MANA 5, cleric usable, Lore and
Magic.
Cloak of the Forlorn: AC 2 WIS -3 INT 3 Sv. Mag 1 MANA 5, INT-caster usable,
Lore.
Krode's Shawl: AC 3 WIS 2 INT -2 HP 15, WIS-caster usable, Lore and Magic
Midnight Sea Mail Coat: AC 15 STR 3 WIS 3 Sv. Cold 10, Erudite clerics, Lore
Magic No Drop.
Shield of the Forlorn: AC 8 WIS 1 INT 2, usable by all SK/PAL/CLR/SHM, Lore
Magic
Soiled Evoker's Robe: AC 7 INT 2 CHA -5 Sv. Poi 5 Sv. Dis 3 HP 10, NEC and
WIZ, Lore Magic No Drop
Ye Auld Ball Peen Hammer: 4/27 1HB, AC 1 STR 2 HP 4, range slot equippable,
all non-INT caster, Magic Lore.

    These are the items I picked out as being useful into the 30's. That
cloak would last an INT caster even longer, since back slot is a weak spot
for INT items. None of these items can be obtained by a high-level in The
Warrens. But it's about more than that. It's about the clerics of Quellious
that cannot complete their holy symbol quests without help, since the No
Drop necklaces they need drop in The Warrens. It's about my little necro
getting aggroed by green trash, then getting the Trivial message and
realizing that's another Kobold Molar I won't be turning in for needed cash
and XP. It penalizes folks for levelling, pure and simple.
