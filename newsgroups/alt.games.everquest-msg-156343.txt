I left your entire post in, unsnipped.

I can't find a single place where it says that paladins will need PoP to
use the post nerf slay undead.

Looks to me like they are simply changing the way slay works, making
it so you can't effectively solo or MT with it up.  If you aren't MT,
slay will still let you boost damage output.  You get to pick, Slay or
not, at any given moment.

But none of that is based, as far as I can tell, on anything PoP related
whatsoever.
