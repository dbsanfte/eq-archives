Well, what exactly is your incentive right now?  Unless you plan on playing
EQ until you die, it's all for nothing whether there's another EQ or not.
Even if you do play 'til you die, it isn't like you get to take your epic
with you.  Seriously, what's the motivation to strive for new gear and level
as it is now?  I for one do it to have a good time, and if a game comes out
that is more fun I'm gonna play that, regardless of how much time I spent on
Game A.  The friends you made will most likely keep in touch and there will
be all new gear to show off, and possibly some good new friends to make.  I
really don't get your point, if you are having fun keep at it.  If it's not
to have fun, what exactly is the reason to play?
