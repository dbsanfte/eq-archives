I would hazard a guess that there might be a consideration that since 
pets can take part of a player's xp, that if the player wasn't forced to 
have to keep resummoning a new pet and got to keep the same pet around 
for quite a while, the player might reasonably expect that the pet 
should start gaining levels which would affect gameplay. Just a thought 
anyway.
