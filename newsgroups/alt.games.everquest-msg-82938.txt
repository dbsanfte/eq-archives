Several minutes, I've heard 5, but I always assume it's faster.  Anyone 
can pick up the items, including NPCs.  It's much easier to have a friend 
hold the stuff to hand over, but if you want to do it yourself, find an 
out-of-the-way place with no NPCs nearby, have both of your characters 
right there, put the item on your cursor, /sit, /camp, when you have 5 
seconds left, drop the item, log in other character, pick up item.

It's 8 characters per server.  There are something like 40 regular 
servers, that's 320 possible characters.  You can also delete characters 
to free up space for other characters.

Unless you're on a PVP server the ONLY place you can be attacked by 
another player without your consent is in the Arenas.  You get two text 
warnings when you enter the PVP area though, so you are warned.

GMs are Verant employees.  With very, very few exceptions, GMs do a very 
good job of being fair and impartial.  They generally are promoted 
from Guides (guides are unpaid volunteers).  Every few months Verant posts 
a request for more Guide applications.

Stackable items stack.  Basically, if an item has a small number at the 
lower right of the icon, it indicates that it is stackable.  Stackable 
items come 20 to a stack, so in a normal 8 slot bag you could hold 8 
stacks of rations, which is 160 individual rations.
