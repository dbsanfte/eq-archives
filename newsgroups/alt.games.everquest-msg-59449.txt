Cloaks are never visible.

Visible armor slots:

Head, Chest, Arms, Wrists, Hands, Legs, Feet.  All other slots, regardless
of what you wear there, are never visible.

Raw Silk armor has no appearance except for the robe, and that is an unremarkable
tan, unless you are the sort of person who appreciates seeing someone who has
bothered to work for his gear.  Raw Silk Robe says "I am not a twink" pretty
loudly.

Pure Caster classes are, in my opinion, shorted by EQ in the fashion area.  With
a few exceptions, their robes cover their arms, wrists, and legs, leaving only
chest,
head, hands, and feet for possible accessorization.  There's very little by way
of heads or hands or feet that have an appearance, either, for a caster.  So mostly

you just see what chest piece they are wearing, and their natural heads.

Raw Silk does not require a pattern specific to the material, the normal
tailoring patterns are used.  In the Freeport area, half are sold at the leather
shop in EFP, while the other half are sold at the inn in N Ro.  I believe
you can also pick up some patterns in EC and WC, but the EFP/NRo
pair represent between them a complete set.  You can also pick up the
superior Large Sewing Kit in the NRo inn, and you'll need it for many
of the raw silk combines, which will require more than one silk swatch
alongside the pattern, something you can't do in a two slot small sewing
kit.

Human Wizard.  Enjoy a challenge, do you?
