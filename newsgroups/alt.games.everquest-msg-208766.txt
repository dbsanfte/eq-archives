Test is of limited value.  Volunteer "testees", most of whom do not
go out of their way to identify and report bugs, just don't find
much that isn't glaringly obvious.  As for the pre-order snafu, I
just don't see why they're incapable of validating something so
obviously important to them.

Hmm, I don't recall any major issues with the Velious launch.  But
still, you'd think they would get better with practice and not keep
repeating problems (they had the same BS with vaporizong levels and
unregistering expansions when they put out LoY).
