An he means everything.  If its laying on the ground and nobody has looted
the bugger, loot it.  Make your armor if you can with ruined skins.  Buy a
small sweing kit and patterns for a few silver and take a training point in
tailoring.  Making your own will save you some money until you can afford to
buy your stuff.  We all started out the same, naked.  :)  Save all your
money, use the starter weapon until you just can't stand it anymore.
Sometimes you'll find someone that is nice and giving stuff away, but most
of the time your on your own.  Beg is useless, but hey if you want to use it
try it on the mobs.  Good luck.
