Why?

There are likely some inaccuracies below... but the gist holds true.

Original game had corpse locate spells/songs & 90% rez. Losing a corpse 
was a real concern for many players in the very beginning. Although by 
the time Kunark arrived there were enough 50ths wandering around that 
getting a rescue was trivial; even Permafrost/LGuk/SolB were perma-
camped with waiting lists for dragons... if you lost your corpse you 
could have just asked for help, and likely gotten it. The only exception 
was the planes.

Kunark added summon corpse spell lines, and 96% rez, as well as giving 
Necros Rez. 

So by Kunark losing a valuable corpse was only really a concern in the 
planes and VP. Although you did occasionally need a 'CR recovery 
team'... a porter to get you out of a one way zone, a summoner to get 
the corpse over, and ideally a rezzer to get you your xp back, and 
perhaps even a cc or dps class for places like HS with aggro mobs right 
at the zone in. Getting a full CR crew did present a legitimate 
obstacle...but that's what guilds are for. You really couldn't actually 
lose your corpse unless you were a very infrequent or antisocial player, 
but yeah, it did take a fair chunk of effort/time to get it out of some 
zones.

Velious & Luclin didn't really change anything. Although Pali's were 
granted rezes with Luclin (iirc??). I didn't play a pali, but I thought 
the pali and lowbie clr rezes were first available in shadowhaven.

PoP added graveyards. It didn't affect the rest of the game, but you 
couldn't really lose a corpse in PoP itself.

With LDoN instances spat out corpses, as you noted. Again the mechanic 
was limited to LDoN.

I beleive ShadowRest showed up sometime after LDoN. ShadowRest 
permanently eliminated lost corpses with a 1 week wait. 0 risk of losing 
corpses.

DoN made it so that for a few pp you didn't have to wait 1 week.

Veteran Rewards gave you another option if you qualified.

Its been reasonably easy to get your corpse out of *almost* anywhere for 
a very long time, and for quite a while now there has been no risk at 
all. 

It really can't get much easier now.
