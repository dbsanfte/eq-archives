Your server must really suck. I do pickup groups all the time, I
rarely get a bad group. One of the best things in eq is meeting new
people. I've made some very good friends from meeting people in pickup
groups. And guilds, theres plenty I wouldnt join if you paid me. Don't
be in a hurry to make judgements about people who are unguilded, I am
after my last guild brokeup, but I'm in no hurry to join a new one,
kind of fun having so many guilds trying to get me to join, i
basically have my pick.
