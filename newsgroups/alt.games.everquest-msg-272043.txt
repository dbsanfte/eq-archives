I think it's only fair that you have to feel your way around a bit now and
then. The ++ mobs are by SOE's own definition impossible to judge fully, so
nothing's broken. IMO, it wouldn't be much fun if the outcome of an
encounter could be predicted with greater accuracy than it already can.

BTW, I bet the grey ++ mob that "beat the crap out of you" was also labeled
"Group", so what were you thinking taking him on alone? ;-)
