Only thing I can say about this is VOODOO2??!!  Come on it's not sony that's
forcing you to dish out money it's the fact that VOODOO doesn't even exist
anymore.  That happened 6 months before Verant/Sony even began suggesting
that we upgrade to DX8.0.  There have been at least a half dozen games out
since Voodoo went out that have required DX8.0 that you would not be able to
play with that card.  So please if you are going to place blame at least
place it in the right place.

That's just my 2cp
