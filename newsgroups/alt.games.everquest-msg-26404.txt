I would have believed that right up until that last guild ban they had. I
mean they started off just using the party line ~"You be exploiting" and as
is the case for every numb nutt that gets banned, the response was "No proof
so you can't ban us".

After several rounds of leaking it out a piece of evidence at a time, they
finally just sent the guildmaster a copy of his guildchat were everyone in
chat was talking about it being an exploit that they had to hurry and use
before it got patched.

You don't do that kind of stuff or go to that kind of level if you are
lukewarm about banning people. Coding and administering the game is probably
just a perk to them, what they really love to do is investigate and ban
people who violate the TOS.

If they ever decide to sit on account transfers, look for them to record all
/tell(s), /shout(s), /reply(s). When the new owner says "What me?" the
response will be 10 or 20 pages of "No, he sold me the account" or "I just
bought this character" type text.
