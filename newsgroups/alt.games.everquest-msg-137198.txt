Think that is weird: was on last night on the Theris Thule server with my lvl 16 mage. was hunting
rabid wolves and bears in qeynos hills and crested the hill near the ent to Surefall. Guards Bixby
and Philban attacked and killed me. I am a human from qeynos and only killed a couple of wolves, 1
gnoll, and a couple of field rats. 
There was a butt-load of people standing outside the ent to surefall and the view bogged down when I
swept over it. After the guards killed me they disappeared and I was able to get my body back.
