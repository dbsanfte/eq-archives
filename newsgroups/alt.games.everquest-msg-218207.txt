I won't call you a liar but anytime anyone claims *at least* in reference to
a statistical fact is already calling his conclusion into doubt.  If you
really knew what the percent was then I would think you would say something
like "I am failing 38%".  If you really do know for a fact then you *must*
have hard data to back it up.  Why dont you share it with us?  If you are
just going on your feeling that it must be over 33% then in my opinion you
dont really know.  Not calling you a liar, but you may be fooling yourself.
