From what I heard from people who kill the Oracle, you can kill the 
Guardian without the Oracle agroing.  He doesn't care.  But, the Guardian 
will help the Oracle.  I'm not about to test this myself, though...

When my necro was lvl 17, before I had any other chars, I was soloing the 
Gargs over there.  I had seen the Oracle and looked him up and found out 
about his robe.  On a whim, I did an /ooc something like this:

"Hello, everyone!  If any of you are so bored of your camps that you need 
something to break the monotony, the Oracle is up over here and I have a 
feeling his robe would look great on a Gnome Necro.  If you feel like 
killing a guy for sport and helping out someone at the same time, slay this 
ugly man!"

It was begging, of a sort, but I really didn't expect anything from it.  I 
had been bantering with some of the people in the zone for a while, and 
making them chuckle.  A chanter and his friend were just about to log so 
they said they'd be right there.  Iwas so excited, for sure!  I was wearing 
raw silk pretty much everywhere, and didn't have a real robe.

I looked up the faction hits for them, and the conversation between them 
went something like this:

"I guess I'll just have the Guardian kill the oracle, and then we can 
finish hime off.  Have an evac up just in case."   "Okay!"

Next thing I knew, the Chanter charmed the Guardian, sic'd him on the 
Oracle, and then cleaned up when the Oracle was dead.  I was in AWE after 
the Chanter explained what happened ( he was level 53, I think ).

That's when I found out that Chanters could charm things and I took my 
mule, a 1st level chanter ( MyMule = Zymyool ), and started to play him off 
and on.  Someday, I am going to duplicate that feat and give the robe to 
someone who can use it.  It will be worth about 45pp at the time, but some 
new person will like it, I hope.

I've been nuked by that oracle, too.  At the time, 270 points of damage 
seemed like a LOT.  I had a SoW and Lev and drug him over to some guys 
killing seafuries.
