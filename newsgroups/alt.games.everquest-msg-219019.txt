I may be smoking crack, or maybe Fennin Ro is special, but after Clerics, 
I've seen a lot more Druids on Main Healer duty than I've seen Shaman.

Huh? Druids get a ~2925 point iCH at 58, and a ~4680 point one at 64. 
Shaman get a 1950 point heal at 58, and SFA afterwards, if you don't 
count their Heal Over Time spells. Unless my info is woefully out of 
date, of course.
