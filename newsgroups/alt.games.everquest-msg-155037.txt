Its obvious to anybody who plays a high end character that a ranger can and
will surpass a monk in sustained damage, and can briefly be the number 1
damage dealer (for 1 minute of every x.. whatever TS reuse time is)

Which means most of the time they are second best damage dealer (rogue,
ranger, monk)
but every now and then (using disc) they can be *number 1* damage dealer

normal :  rogue > ranger >monk
disc: ranger > rogue > monk

Remember we were talking about monks and rangers damage.
