I was just reading along for entertainment purposes, but I just felt 
compelled to jump in with both feet here and call your bluff - such that 
it is.

It seems to me to be a fairly logical matter. If life has been bad enough 
that you feel you would prefer to have never existed, then the obvious 
course of action would be to end it now.

However I don't believe you truly feel that way in the first place. I am 
more inclined to believe that you are merely in the habit of saying 
short-sighted things, even hateful and hurtful things, for melodramatic 
effect. I'd wager that you also feel that you're "tragically" 
misunderstood on a regular basis.

I'm no psychologist, psychoanalyst, psychiatrist or any other psych-type, 
but I do know basic math (it applies here) and I have been around the 
block several times.

Buck up and stop the whinin'. Life is what you make of it and is all 
about choices. If you choose not to make anything of it, there will be 
little to enjoy.
