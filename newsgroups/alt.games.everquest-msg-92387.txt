Mainly because price caps are inconsistant with total deregulation.  That's
part of what brought last year's California Grey-outs.  Just like the power
producers, the ILECs will eventually be forced to sell at a loss.  Not much
of a business model.

Also, there's another big drawback.  Given a price cap, producers will set
their price at that cap.  There is no downward pressure in the market, as
the other companies are also priced at the cap.  Basically, you can't
half-way do a free market economy.

And QWest inexpicably goes out of business.

You point out that de-regulation and the splitting of MaBell eliminated the
monopoly.  Please explain how removing price caps would create a monopoly,
with four competing companies already in existance?

Baseless accuastion.  Congressmen do actually do things without special
interest money influancing them.  Of course, most people only acknowledge
that if the Congress does something they like.  Funny how votes in their
favor are never influanced by special interests.

There are alot bigger threats to our economy than this.  You want to go to
the biggest one, address welfare.  This is a dubious problem at best.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
