>I see people referring to farming.  What exactly is farming?

Gathering some form of resource from the land. Like killing
spiderlings for their silk. Or sitting at the ghoul lord to get as
many yaks as you can. It usually means against opposition you already
know you can and will beat. eg my old guild on test farms Fennin Ro.
