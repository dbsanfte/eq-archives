On a side note, I've never understood the /shout Nazis who get all bent 
out of shape if you use the /shout channel. Sure, if you're asking a 
question about some game mechanic or how to go about using the tribute 
system, but to, for example, enter an area and shout out that you are 
looking for others with whom to adventure seems appropriate to me. 
That's how the character would handle it short of entering a tavern and 
"passing the word", so to speak, so why use a channel created for out-
of-character communication? Is it just the harsh red color that bugs 
people?

Bah, whatever.
