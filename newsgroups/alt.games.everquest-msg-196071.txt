Well, the 'god classes' thing must've passed soon after launch.  I
started in July of '99.  I can't recall just when the xp mechanics
became common knowledge, but it was definitely before Kunark as I
was very glad to have quested for the Deepwater Harpoon which meant
that I could get a little solo xp in Unrest.  The DWH (a heavy 18/40
PAL only 2hs) was obsoleted, along with most other old-world two-
handers, very quickly after Kunark came out.  Within a few weeks the
the Runic Carver (18/37) was selling for under 500pp, less than half
what the Gigantic Zweihander (19/39?) had been selling for the day
RoK was released.
