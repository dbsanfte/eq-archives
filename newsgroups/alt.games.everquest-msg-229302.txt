In Rathe Mountains I get to the hill giants just after they spawn so
if someone has rooted or snared them it's pretty obvious. I watch to
see if there is anyone in the direction they are walking and wait to
see if damage shows up on their life bar. It has cost me a few mobs
but having run druids I try to be extra careful for kiters.
