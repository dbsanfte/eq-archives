It may have taken Frodo a month to get from Mordor to Hobbiton, but
back when Kunark was first released, it took me less time to read
about his journeys then it did for my barbarian to go from Halas, to
OOT.  By the way since when has Kithicor been dangerous during the
day?

I remember ts used to be fairly safe day or night, but my halfling
warrior ran through there yesterday (during daylight hours) and got
wiped out 3 times.  Thankfully a 65 cleric was able to rez me,
otherwise I would have lost ALL my newbie armor and weapons, but still
come on, why is it SO dangerous there in the day now?
