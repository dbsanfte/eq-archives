If someone is "bleeding to death", you can stand around them and try
and drop a fishing grub or something and you will eventually (if they
don't die) hand it to Pain and Suffering. This is the only way you can
target him now.   If you do target him, you can kill him, he has a ton
of hitpoiints and fast regen, but he won't hit back and won't give
xp..

Can do the same at the wiz spires to target "A Mystic Voice".
