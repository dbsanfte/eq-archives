These same people will spend a month questing for armour that adds 2
stamina over what they have... take it with a grain of salt. Yes its a
lot of work for not a lot of reward... but "not worth the cost"? Its
not like there is much else you can do with the xp after a certain
point... sure its not much but it sure beats 'stockpiling AAs'.

Health regen is nice I think. Although not a big deal it adds up.

Some of the utility ones... like mark npc, find party member, inspect
buffs, etc etc are convenient, see target's target's health...
probably not 'worth the cost'... but I covered that already... 

It adds a dimension to the game...so what if its a 'waste of time' ...
that pretty much sums up eq in the big scheme of things... if you
enjoy getting leadership abilities then its worth it
