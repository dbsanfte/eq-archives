I'm hoping against hope that they'll include a way for groups to 
indicate that they're looking for more members, too.  I can't tell you 
how often a group I'm in has been looking desperately for one more so we 
can actually hold a room and I've thought "dammit, we need some way to 
mark the group as LFM".

But they STILL haven't given me the option to put hair ribbons on 
Novasina, dammit!
