your a druid 19?

You will need to have sow on and keep camo up, lev helps too. It is a scary
journey if you are not familiar with it but head over to WC or another druid
ring and ask for a port to the Great Divide then ask for directions. I have
taken a lvl 4 enchanter there by the boat just run along the north shore
line in Iceclad till you get to the bridge then cross it and head straight
across the zone to the GD then head straight to the river and follow that
north through the water fall and into Turgadin the coldain velium vendor is
across from the bank which is to the left once you get to the T at the
entrance.
Hope that helps
