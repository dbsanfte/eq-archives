I sincerely doubt they're pulling anyone off fixing crashes to deal
with these issues - it is (mostly) not the same kind of code, with
most of the "top issues" being either server side scripting or user
interface stuff, which is quite a different thing from collision
detection or (probably) the crash bugs.
