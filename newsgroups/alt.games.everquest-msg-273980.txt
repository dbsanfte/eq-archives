    The players, as you seem to be inferring.

    Indeed, if every player was a roleplaying, storybuilding dynamo, even
the worst MMORPG in existence could be fun to play. Tragically, the average
player can't spell 'roleplaying' and grew up on games that require little
more than hand-eye co-ordination and the intellectual input of a 30ml tub of
yoghurt.

    Well ah, when one class dominates 2-3 of the 4 or 5 primary group roles
while another ranks at best 3rd in one, it is time for a company that has
been comitted to balance for some years to be reminded of their promises.

    The above are, if not indisputibly true, indisputably valid viewpoints
with a wealth of backing evidence.

    Not for $12.95US a month and $50 every half year for an expansion it
ain't. At that price, it better be better than a super-fun-happy
roleplaying-kit.

    From reading various posts one of the worst things they have done is
rampant hand-holding, including alignment enforcement circa late 1970's
roleplaying philosophy.

    If I may put an alternative to this viewpoint to you; perhaps many of us
entertain a less black&white/evil&good view on fantasy.

> Why is it that everyone complains yet no one role-plays, as they should?

    Because there is no ingame mechanism that encourages it I suppose.

    Perhaps he's fed up with Kelethin. Or running from the law, looking for
his long-lost sister, actually hunting dark elves, pretending to be a
turncoat but really being a double agent, on a quest to obtain something the
dark elves guard, making war, scouting for an invasion, looking for the
source of adamantite, on a dare, exploring, lost, evil or insane.

    ...pick a number...

> races/classes?

    Because there is no ingame mechanism that discourages it, and the game
rewards it en-masse. Particularly for 'evil' races and classes, in order for
a half-workable group, usually one has to 'stoop' to grouping with 'good
guys'.

    We the players have quit. Three months later, Sony began to notice.

    We actually can't *stop* any of these things through legal means. No
matter how hard I roleplay, I am as insubstantial as a hologram to a good
character hunting in evil territory. I can't even hurt him without his
consent.

    This is wise, as they can be trained up in a fraction of the
time/boredom against real mobs using high level buffs.

    Laziness rocks. I love not having to grow my own food and harvest it by
hand.

    Sounds like harassment to me.

    Well the balance would be far worse. Take for example trolls.

    Trolls actually don't like any other race, and most other races don't
like trolls. You're stretching it if you think trolls and ogres hang out,
and even trolls and smur- er dark elves is a stretch.

    Now, trolls may be beastlords, shaman, shadowknights or warriors.

    No mezz, no CH, no charm, no high-dps casters. With 6 excellent players
and those restrictions, you will have trouble taking on content that a more
balanced group of mediocre players would find simple.

    They tried PvP teams good vs evil, and the game dynamics were such that
the most successful guilds and groups were good&evil in co-operation.

    Damn crappy players!

    Sony's last 4 expansions have been about sweet FA else.

    Well there is that arena thing off Rathe. Nobody goes there. Oh and the
PvP servers that a tiny number of people play on, yet are perhaps the most
vocal class-balance complaint source.

> Balance the good and evil.

    Sony has been working on class balance since they took over, and its
gotten steadily worse throughout their reign. They have just recently
invented an exciting concept they call server-side logging, where they use
*actual in-game* numbers to help them determine possible differences in
class balance. Players have been providing such data for literally years
now.

    I guess what I'm saying is, they aren't doing so crash hot balancing the
individual classes, perhaps it's best not to confuse the matter further by
forcing them to consider alignment, population and racial group composition
issues.

> Work on the role-playing asspects of the game

    Personally, if I want to roleplay, I'll do with with some dice, some
tables, and a bunch of nerdy folk like myself.

    I used to play EQ for the smallgroup tactics and the sheer freaky rush
of smacking down a powerful behemoth with 30 other nerdy folk like myself.
If EQ was going to go roleplaying centric I'd insist on some serious game
mechanics changes (including the removal of levels, alignment, character
classes, race occupational limitations, the current combat system, the
current tradeskill systems, the physics, the economics, the flora and fauna)
and in the very least ingame peer-to-peer range-base VOIP.

    Roleplaying with text is soooooo 1991.

    BZZZZZT
