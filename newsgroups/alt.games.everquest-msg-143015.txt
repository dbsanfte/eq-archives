Verant took the Nerf Bat to it several times, the original form was
EXCELLENT but in their wisdom (*) they made it random duration like
Root so other than for taunt/emergency runner control situations it
gathers dust in the spellbook.

(*) They also dicked about with the recast time.  At one point you
could virtually chain cast it.
