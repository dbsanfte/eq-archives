Your pet is supposed to be using your resists if they are higher than the
pet's, so a trip to the bazaar to get some +SvM items for yourself might be
worth a try.  I had a similar problem with my magician camping the necro in
Neriak.  He would usually either fear me or my pet sometime during the
fight.  Once I got my save magic up, he was cake.  I bought a couple of +13
SvM rings in the bazaar and some "blue diamond" (I think) gear.  The big
problem was that I gave up a lot of mana to wear that resist gear - maybe
you won't be in the same bind with your lich spells.  If the Crusaders are
near or over your level, I think you'll have a hard time resisting.  I tried
Veksar, setting up camp in the dead end alley next to the ramp and pulling
the courtyard mobs.  Things were going well enough until a shaman gated when
low on health and in short order he came back with a warrior in tow.  I
haven't been back since, maybe I'll give it another go.
