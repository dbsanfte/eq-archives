Why stop with pulling and main tanking?  Here's a paraphrase of
something I've witnessed: (embellished just a little for effect :p)

Guy_01 tells the group:

"Ok, here's what we need to do when the pull comes in.  Miss
Blackguard, when it comes in, you're going to want to orient yourself
so that you're behind the mob.  When that happens, you're going to be
able to backstab it when the key comes up.  Now, backstab causes a lot
of damage, which also causes a lot of aggro, so you're going to want
to evade just so you don't peel the mob off our warrior.  There's no
command for evade.  Instead, you need to turn off attack and hit your
hide key.  Hotkey that now if you haven't already.  Do this whenever
the option to hide comes up.  Okay?  Good."

"Ok, Ms Vicar, here's what you need to do.  When the mob comes in the
warrior's going to tank it, and he'll start taking damage.  When he
does, it's your job to heal him.  This is crucial.  You're going to
need to cast complete heal on him when he falls below two bubbles of
health.  Don't bother with the other heals because they're not as good
or efficient as complete heal.  Use your other heals to spot the rest
of us should we take damage, especially Miss Blackguard because she
might overaggro with those backstabs, or Miss Illusionist, who I will
advise to tash everything. (even if the mob doesn't need it, or even
in groups where there are no casters!)  Got it?  Good."

"Now Ms Elementalist...."

(And on to all of the female characters in the group)

It's terribly funny and yet horrificly sad at the same time.
