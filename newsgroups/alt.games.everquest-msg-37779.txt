You will take different routes to different servers (including the chat
server), so it is still likely not their fault.  They've admitted when it's
their fault often enough that I don't think they're lying the rest of the
time.  No, it probably isn't *your* ISP, but it's *somewhere in between* and
not Verant's problem either.  Welcome to the nature (indeed, the very core
design) of the internet.

I for one will miss the server counts too, and think their marketing drones
are being too paranoid.
