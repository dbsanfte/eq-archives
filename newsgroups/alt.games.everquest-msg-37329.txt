Yeah, in the old world it was a big deal but now the reason why you
see a ghoulbane for 400 plat or 700 plat is because... its worth that,
if even that. Its just not a very good weapon. I tossed my paladin
who is level 9 or so a smoldering brand which is like 19 spd 8 damage
or somehing (I forget) Those go on my server REGULARLY for 1 k or
under. That weapon is WAY better than a ghoulbane, maybe even at level
20 when you'd start getting more max damage with the ghoulbane. The
thing is though at level 20 a pally would be far better off getting a
wurmslayer or something. There are not even many good undead centered 
places to level up now so in a way Ghoulbane is almost rendered a
novelty. I got my pally a Ghoulbane when the quest went in almost as
an afterthought, now I just use it to keep 1 h slash up in case I get
it above 20 and buy it a wurmslayer which is even affordable at less
than 3 k usually. Really 3k for a good main weapon is not outrageous
for a non twink in the late 20's or 30's.
