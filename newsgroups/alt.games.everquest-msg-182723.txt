Yesterday :)

Three entirely new encounters, two entirely new zones.

Surprisingly, this is the short version ;)

Started off getting a rallic pack for my druid.  She's now unencumbered 
without her STR buff :D

Worked on tradeskills a bit, got 15 points of brewing and 25 points of 
fishing.

Got my jade reaver from CoM after only 2.5 hours there :D  Had no idea what 
to expect from the reavers, except that they proc blindness.  We were there 
for a shaman's epic, but unfortunately we ran into some problems with that.  
Sent a petition, but if we don't get a positive response we're going back 
to PoAir.

Went to ssra for the first time at lvl 53.  Group average was around lvl 
55.  We /ooc about heading to the basement and the guild doing Cursed as we 
zoned sends back "only if you want to die."  Pfft.  That sounds like a 
challenge!  One of the clerics from that raid is a friend of our group's 
enchanter and agrees to show us to the elevator and give us a quick tour of 
the basement.  He dies.  Our freshly 56 cleric performs her first 96% rez 
on him.  He virtues us (yay!) and heads out.  We clear some of the unnamed 
wanderers and around the elevator.  We're keeping up with the spawns and 
get bored after two cycles.  We decide to move to the other side of the 
elevator and pull from the temple.  We take down one mob over there and a 
named necro spawns on our tank/puller.  Down goes the shaman and the necro 
is unslowed.  The tank is dying a lot faster than our cleric can heal, so 
camp is called.  Down goes the tank.  Then the enchanter.  Then the wizard.  
Cleric still needs 15 seconds and I'm the last one standing.  I tank that 
bastard and the cleric makes it out with less than a second to spare.  The 
recent recommendation I received from this group to focus on AC/HP/STA gear 
has paid off in spades.  Cleric comes back in and performs 96% rezes #2-6.  
We decide that maybe taking this place without virtue might not be as much 
fun as it was with it, so we head out to the nexus to grab a KEI before we 
head to skyfire.  My guild prides itself on doing things that we don't 
really have the numbers for.  I think we did pretty well here.

The last time i was in skyfire, I was hiding from a goon in OT.  I hit my 
track button back then and not a single thing wasn't red.  Zoning in and 
evacing to OT zoneline this time, I hit my track button and everything is a 
healthy shade of blue ;)  We start pulling at the OT zoneline, but too many 
chromodracs means we zone to keep our buffs.  The shaman recommends we head 
to the BW zoneline, as fewer chromodracs hang out there.  We head on over 
and start pulling.  We get a few spell drops before the tank says something 
about needing to get to bed.  I think "wuss, it's only <looks at the clock> 
1:30am?!"  Somehow i had it in my head that it was around 10:00pm.  
Suddenly the entire group is half asleep and we decide to bail out.

I do the turnins from my jade reaver and head off to bed, a very happy 
ranger.
