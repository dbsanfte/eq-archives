Are you from Europe/using the UbiSoft EQ release? If so then currently LDoN
is not available as a download to Ubisoft customers, you have to buy the
disc. I don't think SOE have given a reason for this yet...

However, there appears to be a way around this:

Sorry, Clarina. Your info was incomplete. However, I have GREAT NEWS  for
any SOE subscribers who are using the UBI patcher. To get the SOE patcher,
download the following ZIP file:

http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support/EverQuest.zip

Unzip the enclosed Everquest.exe and rename it to something else (eg
Everquest1.exe). Copy Everquest1.exe to the same folder as Everquest.exe and
run it from there. This will install the SOE patcher!  N.B.: when the
patcher has run, exit IMMEDIATELY (dont be tempted to press start!), then
start Everquest Invasion as you normally would. You will find the LDON
download box on the ADVANCED menu of the new patcher!

Hope this has helped someone.
