A 42 Warrior can solo just about anywhere all you need are the following
Most Important a Fungi Tunic
Cobalt Armor
Jboots
A good high damage fast Bow (Shadewood, Bow of the Huntsman or better)
Good Weapons (Bloodfire and Silken Whip personal favorites)
Lots of arrows
and open space to run around while you heal
My Warrior took down a Blue HG with about 400 arrows and a Bow of the
Huntsman only. Only took about an hour but I got 17 archery skill points
which was the sole reason I did it.
