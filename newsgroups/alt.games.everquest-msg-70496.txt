Wow...that's a lot of uses of "fuck" in a short space.  That reminds
me of a story from a friend of a summer job he had working at a Navy
shipyard, with these grizzled old mechanics who seemed incapable of
speaking a sentence that did not have "fuck" in it.  One day,
describing an engine that was particularly bad off, one of them came
up with this gem:

	"This fucking fucker's fucked".
