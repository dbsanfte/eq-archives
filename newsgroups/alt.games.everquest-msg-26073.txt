Actually, none of these violate the naming rules, that I can see.

"Tigole Bitties" is okay because Spoonerisms are not disallowed.

"Thundercat" is marginal, but okay because it's not the name of a
work or character of popular fiction (which it would be if it
were "Thundercats" with an "s").

And "Manalope" isn't anything at all, other than a possible
cross between "man" and "antelope".
