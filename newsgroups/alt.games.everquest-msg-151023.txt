AN excellent thought, I forgot this place, perhaps better for him for
a couple more levels than the Hole, even without taking advantage
of his cleric nuke capability on the undead.  Besides the advantages
of a druid in an outdoor zone, it isn't a single camp spot like Hole
Entrance, if one area of COM is busy you just move to another.
Undead and Live mobs come in clusters, with care he can move to
any set-up spot he wants to using camo and ITU... but its just
as easy to fight your way in, instead.

The Hole would be better exp, mob per mob, though.
