My station is on my balcony to my apartment. I have a comfy chair, moderate 
weather (Seattle), a piece of CAT-5 snaking through my window, and a hookah 
gurgling happily by my side.

The other day, it was raining IRL at the same time it was raining IEQ. It 
was a sublime and wonderful moment of atmosphere.
