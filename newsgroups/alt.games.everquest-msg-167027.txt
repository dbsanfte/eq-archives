    I'm aware of the <75 AC penalty but there has to be more to agility than
that, verant wouldnt totally ignore a stat, and there is documentation that
says the defense skill is tied somehow to a raw agility roll, but going on
my own experiences you get hit a LOT less if you have 100agi than 75, but
getting 144agi over 100 doesnt seem to do squat. But thats seat of the
pants, not actual statistical data, which is really what I'm after.
