>>Unfortunatly new naming policy is a piece of crap.<<

At the risk of drudging up an old topic, I wonder if the policy change was
in response to the troubled guy who commited suicide -- you know, as
reported on that fine piece of journalism from 48 Hours?

Wasn't his character name something like "Iloveu"? Maybe someone reported
the name violation and turned out to be one of the factors which pushed the
guy over the edge?
