It was brought up when someone (like you) complained about twinking
(specifically when the trivial loot code was first introduced and
later rehashed).  The basic stand (by Abashi I think, not the new guy)
was that twinking is within the vision for both roleplaying reasons
(ie., your character inherited the items) and the fact that it
provides a way for people who already leveled to high level a way to
experience the game again with different classes.

If that isn't an indicator here's another:  Try and equip the Club of
the Ice Ocean on your level 1 warrior.

You can't.  That club has a built in code that keeps anyone under
level 51 from equiping it.

Code to block twinking exists without the use of No Drop tag.  If VI
wanted twinking out of the game completely, they can simply turn on
that tag.
