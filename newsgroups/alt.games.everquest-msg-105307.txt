    Point, Heffernan. :-)

    At present, very few people use anything they loot off mobs because by
the time you can loot it off a mob you have better. This is due to players
trading items they cannot use themselves for plat. The game has been tuned
to take this into account - compare old world mobs to Kunark mobs to Velious
mobs to Luclin mobs to see how difficulty changes. Also look at the drops
off old world mobs to Kunark mobs to Velious mobs to Luclin mobs to see how
"what should be dropping at level X, with rarity Y" has increased over time.

    Now randomly slap a bunch of level limits on the items in game. And it
is random - level 35 on the axe? Any justification there?

    You now have to re-tune a whole bunch of mobs that previously were "just
right" for people with the assumed level of twinking, since they're now too
difficult for the reward and will become unused content. (It didn't matter
so much that old-world mobs had pitiful loot rewards for the difficulty
because they had excellent XP rewards due to ease.) You've reduced the
volume of trading in the economy because there's fewer people that can
usefully use a given item. You've actually managed to devalue both plat and
items at the same time, since there's less to spend plat on and items are
intrinsically more useless than they already were. And, since you've made
playing alts more difficult, you've pushed more people into playing their
mains into the high-end game where content levels are already strained. So
now you need to re-tune half the damn game and add new content at a higher
pace than before, OR making existing high-end content take longer to get.

    Does that sound like it'll be fun to go through?

    Have you been through any of the "new style" high-end encounters? You
know, the ones people like Furor whine and moan about? I always loved the
basic premise behind raiding: find out if a target is up, assemble folks,
clear to the target, kill it. No sitting on our asses for hours waiting for
something other than the PH, just go in and get the fight you wanted in the
first place. But that meant that players could get through all the world's
content too fast! They must be slowed down!

    Enter ring events, and quested mob encounters.

    Now you HAVE to sit on your ass, killing wimpy mob after wimpy mob, if
you want to see that boss mob sometime after wave 12 or so if we've
programmed this right! Now you get to sit in one spot and grind away,
killing mob after mob, until you get the rare quest drops that allow you to
get to the encounter you really wanted to fight in the first place! I got
excited when I found a no drop "ooze filled phylactery" in Cazic Thule -
this could be the key to activating that big ooze on top of the 4C pyramid!
Then I found out it was one of five rare drops I'd need to activate the big
ooze, and I went from being excited to feeling cheated. I don't want to kill
five thousand blue mobs that I know I can kill, I want to fight a massive
ooze thing that might just kick my ass.

    This is the new paradigm. Don't try and get VI to "update" things,
because they'll just make sure it's all done according to the new paradigm.
And the new paradigm - bringing Evercamp to the last areas of the game that
didn't require camping - sucks.

    I'm just waiting for them to combine all the delaying tactics into one
massive delaying tactic in Planes of Power. Imagine the keyed plane, The
Absolutely Final Plane of Veeshan, Really. The key to get in requires you to
get ten pieces, each one on a god in their own plane (maybe - it is just one
item on the drop table, after all). The gods will, of course, summon every
critter in the plane to aid them, so you have to clear the plane first.
Then, to get to the god, you have to go through a ring-style event to
trigger their spawn. So get keys for everyone that wants to go to the new
plane, assuming you have max ally faction with the key quest giver. Did we
mention everyone starts out KOS to the quest giver but can gain faction,
just like Chardok faction? But wait! Your puny weapons and spells don't work
in the new plane (this way the plane can be tuned against more reasonable
spells than Complete Healing, Turgur's Insects and Shock of Frost)! To get
spells and weapons that can, you need to camp several rare-spawning mobs
across the game which have a chance of dropping the Flerbium Hilt Mold or
Rune of Spewtum which you combine with several other rare-drops to get the
tools you need to fight there. Now you can actually go and challenge
yourself with fights that require strategy and planning - enjoy!

    Lord, I needed to get that off my chest.

    So, um, on the original topic, I guess what I'm trying to say is this:
letting VI tinker with their own game and the fundamentals of how it works
is never good. They always mess up, then overcompensate the other direction.
Is being in a mudflated game good? It creates a progression players advance
through as they gear up, which is good and bad; it creates "XP bottom
feeding", which is bad; it's created an active marketplace for goods which
obsoletes underpowered items, which is good; and it's made the early parts
of the game easier, which is good. A mixed bag, but not a lost cause. So why
mess it all up to "fix the economy", when nobody's yet shown why that
economy is broken or how it detracts from the game more than these changes
would?

    James, not a ranting Swede. Just ranting.
