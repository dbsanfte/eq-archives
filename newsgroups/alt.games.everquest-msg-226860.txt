Er, Shroud of Stealth.  That is absolutely invaluable in many raids,
especially for recovering from wipes.  Rogues can also be used to set up a
CotH and other things.  Their ability to sneak past see-invis mobs seems to
exactly fit the "sneaky thief" description, and gives them a very valuable
role in many raids.

Admittedly, this only happens after level 65 and getting some AA's.  Still,
I've heard very little complaints from rogues, except for the
profanity-filled "Consent, you morons!" they fill guildchat with.  =)
