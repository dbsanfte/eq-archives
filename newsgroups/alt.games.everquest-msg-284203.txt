But none of those places tell you whether the servers are up or not.  I 
wouldnt' mind, honestly, wherever they want me to go, no problem. But 
there's no such place; the only way to tell the servers are up is to 
successfully log in.  And its possible to fail to log in even if the 
servers ARE up, for a variety of reasons, one of which is login server 
overcrowding, but another being a glitch in your system, which might be 
soluble by a means as simple as rebooting, or more drastically by 
erasing files, or fixing your DirectX or... well I've seen a number of 
these in my day and I'm sure you have too.

Two minutes?  Yes, but how many times?  If I could arrange to have sex 
as often as I've tried to log in but been rebuffed on a patch day, I'd 
have to make the Cialas purchases in bulk!
