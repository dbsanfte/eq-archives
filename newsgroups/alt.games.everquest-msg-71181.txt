Copying the entire CD and posting it on the 'net wouldn't do
you a drop of good.  The files are no good without a one-per-
customer-use-it-and-it's-no-good-to-anybody-else CD key
on not only the game, but each individual expansion CD,
too.

Refer yourself to your "should buy the game in a store"
line if you want to play.
