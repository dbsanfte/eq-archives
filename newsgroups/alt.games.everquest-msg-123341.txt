Ok having read as many of the replies as have come though, assuming a
mid 20s or higher player the simple answer is :

Druids

Why is easy. Without equipment(and this includes other peoples
equipment so no grouping) you better be able to do just about
everything. Consider this:

1. Out of all the chars Ive played a naked a druid is better off even
than a naked wizzy or anything else for that matter. CRs or sever
transfers are just easier which I base this on.

2. Food/water no problem

3. Armor and hit point buffs. regen/heals, DD, DOT( manna efficient
cause we aint got 214 Wis no more), Port, attack, and SPEED Buffs. If
ya naked you better be fast. Lessor Succor to cross some dangerous
zones easily.

4. The ability to survive an encounter with a mob and kill/get away.
Snare/ root / camo / etc make this much easier.

Yeah I know not the way most have looked at this but stop and think
about having to cross 5 zones 3 of which are nasty. On foot speed is
king course porting makes that prob moot anyway. Would put wizzy a
distant second due to the healing factor.

Cant believe yall missed this, but maybe I missed a post or 2.
