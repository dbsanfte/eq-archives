What? How is cancelling your account extreme? Your characters won't be
erased, and you will be able to take a month or two off without
wasting any money. I always cancel my account right after I open it. I
get to play for a month and then I can decide whether I want to keep
playing after my month of play is up. That's the best way to do it if
you don't plan on playing in 3 month blocks. Keeping your account open
when you aren't playing is a waste of money. If you get the urge to
play and your account is closed, just pull out your credit card and
reopen it.
