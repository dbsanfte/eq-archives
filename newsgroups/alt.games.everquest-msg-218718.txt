No, the discussion has a point without the spill. Right now, the
debate is that the environment (EQ) was responsible for worsening of a
pre-existing condition in a player that led to his death through no
direct action of the game itself. The player entered into the
environment, interacting in a community that is known to have the
potential to cause social stress when he had a pre-existing mental
condition that made social interactions a problem. He was  walking
improperly on an injured leg, and complications resulted.

In this case, due to his problems, he wasn't totally responsible for
his actions. That responsibility, then, falls to his guardian: His
mother. She didn't familiarize herself with the community, and she
didn't remove him from it when the first signs started surfacing that
he was ill-equipped to handle it.

True, part of therapy for social disorders would be to interact in
social settings, but online communities are not suitable for this.
They are harsh.
