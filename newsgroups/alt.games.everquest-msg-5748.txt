This hypocrite cracks me up.

Bizbee, I have no doubt you'll be reading this, so listen good, twerp.

Quit hiding behind your kill file's skirts, you pussy.  You think you're a
ballsy fucker, when in actuality, you're a scared little bitch who tried to
dick around in my newsgroup, got your little pee-pee slapped back in your
pudgy face and thought YOU had accomplished something.  You don't even have
your shit straight enough to post intelligently.  You quote Brat, who
doesn't even play Fighter Ace, yet you see him as some kind of authority on
the game.  Pathetic.

You're not even amusing any more.  You're just a scared punk who's unable to
hang with the big dogs.  I hope you're not the best this forum has to offer.

Sword
