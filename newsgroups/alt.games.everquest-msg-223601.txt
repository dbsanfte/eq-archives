Hmm, easiest mobs to melee I can think of are the shrooms in FG, but, I 
don't know that you can single pull them at level 61.  Not sure that you 
could solo one off hand either, my experience, of course, involves 
slowing them first, after that, I can let one pound on me pretty well 
indefinitely.
