Natimbi has become a bit of an annoynig zone.   They lowered the level
of it (I.e. by XP) and then when bards moved in, some of the creatures
there now summon.

All of those have been changes since the zone first opened.  Its an
great zone for many as a few nice rare drops come out.  

For solo there, alot will depend on the class.  Mages/Necro/Beast can
do it a bit earlier.  They just have to watch themselves.
