Of course, if your dialup connection likes to disconnect you in the middle
of the night, even when you have a full stream of info going through the
lines...then it becomes a big pain in the arse.....

When beta testing for WWIIOnline, it took me several days to get the game
downloaded trying while sleeping and at work, simply because my ISP would
regularly reset my connection every few hours...usually when the download
was just over 95% complete....
