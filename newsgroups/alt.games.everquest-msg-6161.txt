I've got a druid who can bind. I've considered binding myself to the top,
then having someone duel me and kill me up there at top. I re-spawn there,
and do a naked jump to the bottom, while my corpse with all my stuff on it
is safely still at the top. Might actually be kind of fun. Sure there is EXP
loss, but don't people often jump on purpose? Just to take the maximum
possible damage? I think a jump as a LV1 who hasn't done anything but put
guild note in the bank (to keep it safe) would be a fun time to jump. I've
also thought of other places to jump from, just for fun, just to look down
(as 1st person view) to see the fall. My Iksar made his first mistake by
thinking it was slow to climb back down the "Tower of Terror" where the SK
guild is, so he made a running leap off the top of the highest balcony. His
next words..."K-Hhhhhhhhhhhhh" (or what ever the sound they make is). Fell
for twice his HP in damage. Pretty bad when your first corpse run is just
after turning in guild note. Oh well, at least it wasn't from H, Auto-attack
on....AAAHHHH!!!!!
