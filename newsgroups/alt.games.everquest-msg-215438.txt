Perhaps. But spreading a warning about a hoax is not qualitatively 
different than spreading the hoax itself.

All it takes is one person to read your post, before the replies were 
made (or even afterwards), and forward it to their IT department asking 
"Is this real?"... from which too many IT departments respond ... no its 
a hoax, and forward the thing to the entire corporate userbase to ensure 
nobody else is confused by it. And surely at least one of them will 
forward it to all their friends to warn them about the hoax.

So now instead of spreading 'the hoax', we're spreading a 'warning about 
the hoax'. Its entirely possible this 'warning about the hoax' will 
spread for years... possibly outliving the actual hoax.

The virus has simply mutated, and possibly ensured greater chances of 
survival.

:)

There is actually a field of study (memetics) that studies 'contagious 
ideas' that spread like virii. Virus hoaxes aren't the normal subject 
matter, but they appear to meet all the requirements for an extremely 
sophisticated meme.
