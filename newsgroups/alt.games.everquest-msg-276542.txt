I've recently been doing some hunting there with a 35 monk and a 24 mag. 
And it is still a good place to hunt. With the monk I was just running around
picking up whatever gnolls I found (except yellow/red). With my mage I would
sit on the hill next to the bridge zone in. At that time gnolls were wondering
from SP to bridge and back. I'd pick one out and take it down. It's been a week

or two since I have been there and I went back yesterday and the gnolls were
not 
wandering to the bridge anymore. Not sure what is up with that, but they were
still all hanging out around SP. Just have to be carefull and keep your eyes
open.
