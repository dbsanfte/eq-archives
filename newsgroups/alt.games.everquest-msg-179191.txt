I have gotten ONE gnoll part.

Your next step is to make the Halas meat pies with all those meat 
fillets in cream- that will trivial at 226.

If you can forage, or have friends that will, buy cinnamon from the 
Faydark, or mushrooms from Luclin. Pixie-cinnesticks trivial at 202, as 
does Ohahaba mushrooms.

You can also make noodles and casseroles, but probably the easiest way 
to get close to 200 is with patty melts. Get a frying pan= molds for 
sale in Jagged Pine- and buy the cheese there, and you can get to 195 on 
storebought stuff.

After the meat pies trivialed, I made griffon and anaconda melts, and 
Justice Fruit pies, and Holy Cake.
