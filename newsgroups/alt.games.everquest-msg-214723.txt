True enough if you're restricting it to that low of a level, and just
starting abilities.   But if you are, then lets make it across the board.
At those levels, 20 points of extra starting wisdom will not traslate into
huge boosts in mana allowing you to kill things you otherwise cannot.
Hell, from 1-15 or 20, shaman melee isn't all that bad, and will probably be
used to supplement thier weak spell lineup.   In which case armor class and
hit points would still be more important, just for different reasons.

As long as it's not hurting you, you should always plan for the future.   In
a game 65 levels and hundreds of AA's long, advising someone to select
unaterable stats based on the first (extremely quick) 24 levels seems a poor
choice.

Actually I've seen several necromancers that I would consider knowledgable
give just that viewpoint.   I don't frequent necromancer boards though, so I
don't know what the unwashed masses are advising.  So perhaps you're right
about what those necros would say.
