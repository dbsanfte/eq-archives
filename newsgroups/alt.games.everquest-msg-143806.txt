This is more than a difference in semantics. There's a huge difference
between "the high end of the price scale" and a complete ripoff price.
Perhaps that's where the breakdown in communucations is happening.

Exactly, and that's still completely in line with what I wrote above,
and previously. Let's go back to the batskull earrings for the OP again.
Obviously, prices differ on various servers, but on Xev that items tends
to be pretty easy to find for 100 plat. I've seen them advertised for
125 and even 150 on occasion, and they might be the only one online
selling one at that time. This is pretty much the range, day after day.
If somebody has a few of them and just wants to dump them, they could
probably come in and put them up at 25 plat. That would be lowballing.
If the OP found them for that, then great, he saved some serious money.
Me? I'd probably buy them myself, mark them up to 100 and put them back
up for sale. But if one person is thinking how much he paid for them in
GFay to some guy back when they were first out and figures he should get
500 plat for them, he can mark them for that. But they won't sell.

Pre-bazaar, even if people did regularly sell them for 100 plat in GBay
when they felt like stopping in to auction, the OP might have gone
there, run into the jerk who knew that and still charged 500 plat, and
gotten totally ripped off.

This is one of the primary reasons why I think the bazaar is such a huge
boon to the buy, and in particular, the newer player.
