  Anthrax Terrorists may be Zionists

  La Voz de Aztlan

  Los Angeles, Alta California - October 9, 2001 (ACN) - On
  Monday July 9, 2001, we received a handwritten letter in our
  mail box addressed to the publisher of La Voz de Aztlan. The
  letter had no return address but had a July 5, 2001 U.S.
  postal mark from Santa Clarita, California. July 5, 2001 was
  on the week that the second largest Jewish publication in
  the United States, the Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles
  published a very negative article about our publication
  because we had written a series of pro-Palestinian and
  anti-Zionist editorials. The one page letter contained a
  small amount of a yellowish white substance and the text of
  the letter alluded to the fact that Jews had an illustrious
  history in biological research that included the development
  of the Salk vaccine. The letter ended with "Unfortunately,
  if Hitler was alive today he would pin a medal on you.
  Unfortunately during World War II the Arabs also supported
  Hitler. Racism and hatred destroy!"

  A few minutes after opening and reading the letter, I
  started sneezing and coughing and became ill with flu like
  symptoms. I connected the commencement of the symptoms with
  the suspicious white substance in the envelope and proceeded
  to place the letter and envelope in a plastic zip lock bag.
  Within hours I was able to see my doctor and he put me on 30
  days of antibiotics. I have had recurring flu like symptoms
  ever since.

  A few days ago a similar situation occurred in Boca Raton,
  Florida where, according to news reports, a letter was sent
  to the offices of a news service with a white soapy
  substance that killed at least one person. Another person in
  the office tested positive for Anthrax spores in his
  nostrils. The laboratory engineered Anthrax spores came in
  the mail in an envelope that included a "Star of David"
  charm according to an Associated Press news article released
  today. The FBI is presently conducting an investigation and
  very little information has been released concerning this
  case.

  Everyone is assuming that Islamic terrorists are to blame
  for the Boca Raton Anthrax incident. We believe that the
  terrorists are actually Zionists. The reason is that we have
  just experienced a second act of terrorism that has
  compelled us to open an investigation with our local police
  department. On September 27, 2001 we received an e-mail with
  a message to shut down our website within 48 hours because
  of our anti-Zionist content or face the consequences. At
  first we dismissed the threat as another crackpot because we
  receive many run of the mill threats weekly. The next day,
  however, I personally received a second threat and this time
  the person gave my correct home address and said that he
  will be making a visit soon if we did not shut down our
  website. On September 29 the person with a yahoo.com e-mail
  address sent another e-mail saying that he knew every step I
  made and that he has been close to me already without me
  even knowing. A few days ago this same person sent a recent
  photograph of myself as an e-mail attachment in "gif" format
  taken with a telephoto lens. This last act led us to take
  this threat seriously and we have now met with the Whittier
  Police Department. A case file has been opened and Detective
  Rivera has been assigned to the investigation. Tomorrow,
  October 10, 2001 we will turn over the sealed "letter and
  envelope" we received on July 9, 2001 for a viral/bacterial
  analysis.

  Both incidents of terrorism against La Voz de Aztlan have
  been from Zionists. The envelope sent to the Boca Raton news
  service with the "Star of David" charm appears to also come
  from Zionists. They, the Zionists, want to silence us
  because they do not like what we write. Everyone is assuming
  that the dangers we face is from Islamic terrorists, but our
  experience has been different. We fear Zionist terrorists
  more. They have been trying to take away our constitutional
  right of freedom of political expression through acts of
  terrorism. They are utilizing acts of intimidation to try to
  silence and shut down La Voz de Aztlan.
