Bah, the desperate will always turn on you at the least provocation. I
wouldn't worry too much about it. Sure, you might have forseen the
problems by their level of zeal, but enough was enough I would guess.

Besides, if they wanted it badly enough to be upset with you like
that, then they should have offered enough for it to seal the deal.
After all, their adding little by little to their offers in an attempt
to win the bidding war with minimum expense was largely the reason for
your ultimate frustration and the subsequent breakoff of negotiations.
They obviously had more to offer and were perfectly willing to do so
if they deemed it necessary.

Chalk it up to just one of those things. Your rep isn't going to be
able to weather some of the odd folk out there, regardless of your
efforts.
