AR, RoZ, and Bedlam is only gonna give you 6khp, yeah I know you said
about!! Really can't be bothered with keeping Bedlam memmed, cos of its
short lasting duration.

Hmm, I also notice that my RoZ is always the 1st to go which is a pain, but
Im just thinking now if that's because I buff myself with that 1st...or is
it a game mechanic that it wipes that one first?

Boggle is awesome, tash that mofo early (the ones that need it atleast),
cast boggle, bye bye agro..slow, boggle again if needed.Love it. I dont even
have 3300 hp with self buff, virtue and bmb and can take some heat from 500
hitters...thanks to boggle.
