Just to be clear, Martin... I was just kidding. I think Monks are fine
the way they are. (Well, assuming they fix FD. You are FAR from the
first I have heard reporting these and other FD related problems. And I
don't mean the idiots who don't realize that a long casting spell hit
them after the feign, either.)

Only have kidding about manaburn. Will be a long time before I get up to
those levels, but the wizards are very nervous about all the boohooists,
particularly the ones from the big guilds, whining about it. A big swing
of the fucking nerfbat from VI is not at all impossible here, IMO.
