They also get resisted a lot, which makes their mana efficiency even 
lower.  On average I probably hit with 2 out of 3 waves, so they do 
better than the DD spells, but, not as good as the Poison DoT.  Also 
something to consider, it is a rain spell, and will affect mezzed mobs 
nearby, and potentially unaggroed mobs above or below (or so I am told, 
never tested that theory).
