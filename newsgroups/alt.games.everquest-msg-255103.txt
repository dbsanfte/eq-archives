My level 55 monk is Ssleeslak, number 1736 on that list. Note how many
higher-level monks are below him on that list, including some 65's. Now add
ten levels of HPs and a pair of Velium Gemmed Claws to him and see how many
monks fall below him. Do a sort by AC and he's square in the middle of a
large number of level 65 monks, same if you sort by ATK (and his STR isn't
stellar).

All his stuff is from The Bazaar.

If you aren't a raider, the key is cash. Plat, plat, and more plat, and
items that you can sell for plat. A pair of velium gemmed claws, ornate
boots and gloves (or epic in hand slot), valorium rings / bloodmetal
earrings and a Soulscream belt and you're going to be very pleased with your
stats regardless of your other slots. If you can, save up for the arms
Ssleeslak has - they're incredible for the cost. In case my EQRankings link
is bad:
