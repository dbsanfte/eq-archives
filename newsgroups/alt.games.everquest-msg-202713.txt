At the high end - absolutely - no question about it.  It takes
a very well equipped monk to match the DPS of a wizard at the
high end.  Wizards are the damage kings on Raids, one of the
top DPS classes in groups and one of the top soloers in the high
end game.

Today in the Undead Weaponsmith area of Nadox - 62 mage (me -
was 63 but, umm, see my post on that one, it's too painful
still), 63 wizard, 61 ranger, 65 ranger, 65 cleric and 65
druid.  Many times I wasn't even getting much opportunity to
nuke, and with other people's spell damage being visible now
it was apparent why.  No question he was outdamaging me.  
Basically I had 90DPS steady from my pet (god bless MA's who
know how to position and a lack of melee's who shove the 
mob all over - ranger tank, pet on the back, other ranger
uses archery - the tank and pet balance each other's push
out and the mob stays right where it needs to be :) plus
the steady damage from a 45pt DS on unslowed mobs (not 
insignificant) and maybe 1 SoFB on most mobs, none on the
mobs that were light blue before the patch (level 50) and
have only 8k hp, 2 or a FoT on the 56+ mobs with more 
HP - and pray to the god of resists.  We believe that the
drowned sailors down there are just to soggy for my fire
nukes to work well :)  And I need 63 back and 17.5 k to
get a decent magic nuke (Shock of Steel is HOPELESSLY 
outdated).

Now for the fine print - I had PoT9 and my own mod rods as
mana regen (about 13 mana per tick total) - of this I spent
1080 every 15 minutes (about 7 mana per tick) to give rods to
the wiz/dru and cleric.  He, OTOH, was able to TP up to the
nexus, get KEI, gate to his bind point just outside Nadox
and get CoH'd down in about 4 minutes flat - so he had >
KEI, PoT9, Wiz Epic, Allegiant Familiar, Harvest (just the
first, not the 2nd) and Mod Rods.  By my reckoning that's
around 40 per tick extra regen - meaning I had a net 27 
medding and he had a net 61.  That sounds like a lot (and
it's not bad) but it is the norm for a wizard in a group 
like that - and it allows them to maintain an impressive DPS.

Now, I could have been selfish and used my mana for nuking,
and not give it away to others in the group - but I summon
a rod for 360 mana, they get 900 mana out of it, and both
the Druid and Wizard use it more effectively than I do -
so it's a no brainer :).
