Unteresting that this should be post at the same time as My post on
this topic. Being new I was unsure of the ettiquette on the subject.

This is the first thing I have found in the game that I have a
complaint about. I prefer playing a spellcaster and at suggestions of
friends I started as my first character a Druid (surprise, surprise).

I have to this point played laying back nad tossing in the occasional
nukes and snares and healing but I see my playstyle is going to have
to change. I am going to have to wade in and get up front if I want to
get any good loot.

Unfortunatly that is how the players work these kinds of things. It
only takes a few inconsiderate/greedy players to spoil all the good
intentions in the game. For a company that seems to put a lot of
emphasis on cooperation and ingame manners I am frankly quite
surprised that this hasn;t been dealt with before this.
