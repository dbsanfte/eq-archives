From the shadows, the mysterious newshound007@freedom.net

You're confusing the issue again. I have always maintained that PoK
was a consequence of a mature EQ. This is not to say they shouldn't
have been put in, it is just saying putting them in indicated a shift
in priority away from where it was originally, and developers of new
games should realize that putting in a PoK system for a new world is
not necessarily the kind of good idea (?) it was for EQ a few months
ago.

This is a good thing. Assuming there is a reasonable supply of
different mmorpgs to choose from, this will separate those who wish to
maximize their efficiency from those who want a world to play in.
