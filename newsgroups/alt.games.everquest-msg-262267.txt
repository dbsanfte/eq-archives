Easy - the dragon is fighting your control and not giving
his all.  The higher the level of mob, the more they fight
and the less (percentage wise) they should do of their
uncharmed hit.

Also, you always balance game mechanics first, then find
an RP reason.  Building a class around what makes sense
from an RP sense gives you the original Necro - gods by any
other name.
