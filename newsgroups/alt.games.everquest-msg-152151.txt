    So did I. My cynicism looked at it this way: they asked which did we
want to happen after PoP is released. So my brain interpreted them as
saying, "Which of these options do you prefer:

(1) We release PoP as a buggy PoS, but fix it as quickly as we can.
(2) We release a working PoP with all the later content unfinished, and
create the 'new content' HAHA as quickly as we can."

    So I voted for (1), as at least we can play in the old world and scoop
tons of spawns with the frequent patches!

    All kiding aside, I voted for fix and revamp because I really think
fixing is all EQ needs to be pretty good. That, and the one example of a
"new idea" they included (player shadows) seemed so stupid that I could just
imagine how crazed the rest of their ideas would be.
