Regardless, attempting to silence him only using the fact that James
is in an elemental flagged guild is rediculous. There's a rather large
population of completely clueless idiots in elemental planes. It's not
hard to get there once you have the gear and all it takes to get the
gear is time. Remember, only a minority of EQ players actually have
the ability to plan and execute raids (and know what has to be done,
what works, what doesn't work, and why), the rest just come along for
the ride, get their flags, and continue bumbling around in the next
tier like they've always done. Not that James is one of those.

He had a good point about the AC too. The shoulders aren't as bad as
he made them out to be (and everyone forgets the missing shorties on
the IGS races list) but they're certainly not the best thing he could
have either....
