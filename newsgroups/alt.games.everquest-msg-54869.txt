The Blood Reaver. No data in Illia's db.
Looks like the other drakes, just MUCH bigger. He's a skelton looking thing.
He is a dragon class though.
He resisted just about all the nukes and casts from my group. Blue to a 51
mage.
Hit me for 2x 500AoE, 'nuff said.
Next thing I know, I'm waiting for a rez.

Don't know of anyone that dropped this guy last nite. Usually, everyone who
was dumb enuff to fight it, got killed.
