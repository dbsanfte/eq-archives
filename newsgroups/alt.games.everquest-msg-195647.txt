They hunt the bloodgill barracudas and goblins, you want the stuffed
barracuda which is easy pickings at a fairly low level (early teens
definitely). I did the first cudgel, but then I could never find the
rogue shaman in Field of Bone since I couldn't get a tracker to come
help me. And then I stopped playing my shaman.

The stuffed barracuda swims close to the bloodgills at times, but
usually it's a fair bit away and is easily pulled away alone.
