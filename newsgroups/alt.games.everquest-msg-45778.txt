Unfortunately, long before EQ came out, online gamers discovered
a way to cheat death.  Quit the game when it becomes clear death
is about to ensue, or that you are about to lose, or whatever.

I recall a game called Chronx as my first introduction to this concept.
Basically a card game set up on a global ranking system, your rank
was based on a formula of some complexity, but at its heart was the
idea that when you beat someone they lost some points and you won
some.

Some players, high ranked ones in fact, would mysteriously go link
dead just as I started to beat them.  Oddly, they'd almost never
go link dead shortly before beating me.  Their ranks climbed and
mine plummeted, even if I could see I was better than them... I'd
almost win two games and then actually lose one.

They were pulling the phone cords out of their modems before
losing.

Similarly, anyone playing EQ could easily fake link death when
it looked like they were going to die.  There is no way for the
system to tell what happened, whether the disconnect was on
your end, at your ISP, in the pipeline, or even on the EQ server
itself.

One solution to this would be to kill you instantly on LD.  A
little harsh though for those of us who aren't "Plug Pullers."

What Verant has done instead is to force your character to
stay around for a couple minutes, and -then- let you out.  If
you look at your EQ time, 90% of it isn't inherantly risky,
a couple minutes standing around doing nothing usually won't
kill you.

This does penalize soloers more than the rest of us, since
we generally have partners or groupmates to help defend
us, while you will literally just sit there and die if you
get aggro while LD.  On the other hand, you get all the
loot and all the exp off your kills; if you have a decent
connection, you are likely ahead of the game even factoring
the additional LD deaths in.

To help lessen the odds of this, try to med in "safe" places
(free of wandering mobs.) instead of right up where the
action is, even though if you are paying attention that forward
spot is defensible.  If you are getting the disconnect on
your end, not due to server load from your fights, then the
odds are well in favor of you going LD while medding, your
most common activity.
