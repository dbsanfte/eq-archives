Have seen very little information about these.  Have been on 2 of them
but stil don't know:

a) Is there a 7 level differece to join anexpedition like LDoN ?

b) Is there a graveyard for them?  As all the mobs repop behind you
this could make CR rather hard if not.

c) Are they for 3-6 players like LDoN ?

d) How to get the names to spawn.
