Well, here's an idea... Cut the "be online" part and the "Everquest"
part for a while and save a bit of money. If you did that, you might
actually be able to afford a few - perish the though! - Christmas
presents for friends and family.

If you're dumping money into a leisure time-sink, as Orlun said, you
have no place whining about being in dire straights financially.
Here's a word for you to look up: "Prioritize".
