So I was wandering around PC killing fiends and grinning over my shiny 
new Cure Disease, and killing ShikNar and mushrooms, having some fun and 
getting some skills up after my breakneck rise via Dain MMs.  I'd just 
killed the big named mushroom (drops an AC 12, +3 wis shield, be still 
my heart) when I got a tell from a guy who'd been soloing the B1 camp, 
asking me to come join him.  We'd been bantering a bit in the general 
channel, and I guess he noticed I was around his level and figured what 
the heck, even though he'd been soloing the camp for several levels already.

Well, I joined him, so now we're a 22 SK who's pretty much untwinked, 
and a 20 warrior who's definately deep into twinkdom and buffed to the 
gills.  We make fairly quick work of bandits for a bit, some other 
people join us, and the warrior convinces me to try NL.

I know the conventional wisdom is that PC is better exp than pretty much 
anywhere, right up until the mobs go cyan on you, but since I'm actually 
working on skills rather than trying to exp as fast as possible, that 
doesn't bother me, so off we go.

Well it turns out, pulling two or three at a time, that we end up 
getting twice as much exp in an hour as we were back at the bandits 
camp, even when it was just the two of us clearing it.

So, either they nerfed PC exp, or NL has a pretty high ZEM of its own, 
or its just the difference in levels of our targets is so high that it 
overcomes the whole ZEM thing.  Meanwhile, there was no competition for 
mobs, there were guards we could pull to if things went bad, its closer 
to POK so running back to pick up more bandages and arrow parts worked 
better (well, I suppose there are probably bandages somewhere in 
Shadowhaven, I've never really figured that place out), for SOW classes 
(which we didn't have) there's DS or... MS?  right next door to refresh 
SOW in.  And best of all, it wasn't PC for the 200th  time!

This isn't the first time I've fought in NL, and I've always found it a 
nice friendly zone to work, but I'd always assumed the exp was better 
back in PC.
