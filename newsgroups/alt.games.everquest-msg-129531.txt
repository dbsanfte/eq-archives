Hill Giants range from level 33 to 37.  Could you land any offensive spells
on something 13-17 levels higher than you?  They have about 2500 hitpoints.
You probably don't have enough mana to do that much damage, even if all
spells land, so you are looking at some serious medding during the fight,
which could be difficult if they resist rooting.

Sounds like you need to wait a few levels.
