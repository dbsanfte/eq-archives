}I saw you in there, not sure if I was on my main at the time though.

Yeh, the person I presume was Ryou was saying she was going to pester you 
to join, so when you showed up as an alt, at least I had you positively 
identifed. :)

By then, though, we were exping in the deep and it was going well so I was 
kinda distracted.  It was a great example of an evening going exactly 
according to plan. :)  I'd decided I really wanted to try to getone of my 
asshat luclin spells in the name of spellbook completeness, which meant 
either levitation or everlasting breath.  So I suggested to the guild that 
we get a group going at the vamps in tenebrous, but nobody was up for 
that, and they counteroffered "well, how about the deep?" :) So from there 
it was just a slight push to get them over to where the Deranged Underbulk 
spawns, and it popped like clockwork in about half an hour.  And then this 
shammy that I hadn't seen around before was bursting with "Aack! I've been 
looking for that spell forever!", so we rolled on it, and I won, then I 
noticed she conned red to me... Aw, her forever was even longer than my 
forever!  So in an uncharacteristic fit of generosity, I insisted that she 
take the dang useless spell anyway.  So then she dithered and thanked me 
and went back and forth on it, and finally about an hour later I said, 
"no, definitely, scribe that sucker!" and she finally did... just before 
the Deranged popped again and dropped -my- copy. :)  Muahahah!  Karma is 
my bitch. :) 

But I still want to know... has anyone found any uses for the common drops 
in there?  Especially those no rent 'a Deepspore's off the deepspore 
mushroom... That -has- to be for -something- cool...
