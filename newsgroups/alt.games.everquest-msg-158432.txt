That all depends on the mob and the force fighting it. MAestro had full dots
last on him. We keeled him good.

I don't get more aggro than anything else I do.... play sensibly.

If you have never grouped with a necro, and suddenly mobs turn into skellys
around, you spend a lot of time thing WTF just happened, and where is the
mob I'm fighting? This is of course the problem of never letting a necro
group with you- you don't know what a group friendly necro can do for you.

Also, if you have the melee gathered around a GIANT mob, and suddenly it's a
normal person sized skelly, and there's no longer as much room to get in
there and kick its butt... the mellees aggro on the caster.
