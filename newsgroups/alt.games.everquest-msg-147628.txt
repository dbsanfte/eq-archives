Yeah, I thought so , You can't reply with out your childish put down.
All I said was that Verant could have done what everyone else had
done, which was show a little respect.How often do you even got o the
main web site. Would it have bothered you if they had, probably
not.You probably wouldn't even have noticed it. But OK I'm a Jackass.

Once again more, Insults. Seems to me you can't reply with out them.

More even, You still haven't explained how I'm a "Friggin Disgrace to
humanity" from one post here.
Insults show lack of communication. You don't seem to know how to
reply to my question.

More childish insults, I've been here a while and I notice that anyone
that goes against the big posters is labeled a troll. Why is that.They
can't all be trolls. Some have even had valid points, yet they are
attacked and labeled trolls because a few don't like them.

True my post was insultive to Verant, but I was truly angry, the 
difference is my anger was aim at a company not an individual, You
have a problem communicating with others if you believe that profanity
has nothing to do with maturity.
It shows lack of reasoning in your speech. Profanity has no place in
an mature conversation.

Once again, more name calling. Why am I a troll by telling you my
reason for quitting EQ? I mean, it's true is it not. So how am I a
troll.I actually enjoyed EQ for the time I played it.

Once again, it is true. So how am I a troll. Just because you don't
like me. Hell, you don't even know me. I'm just stating "my" views on
things. I'm not attacking the game at all if you think about. I was
pissed at the powers that be in Verant , not EQ the game.

No, I guess you can't tell me how you can to your conclusion, only
childish insult.

Like I said I've been here a while, just because I don't post all the

So , I see you can't explain yourself and your deduction on how I'm a
"fuggin' disgrace to humanity", do you alway insult everybody that
speaks their mind?
I've been caught? Doing what? This is a forum where one can speak his
mind is it not. Troll. I don't think so. But you have shown to me that
you really can't express your self in a mature manner. Only with stabs
at me can you converse.

So I , as well as the forum,  duly note.
