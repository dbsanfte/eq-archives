I used to get the same problem all the time, the only difference is
mine didn't have to reboot several times or go into safe mode.  I
tried everything I could think of, including defraging the hard drive,
but that didn't help.  Eventually I realized it only happened when I'd
play several sessions without rebooting.

Hope you find the root of the problem...
