First off yellows are not equal to you they are 1 or 2 above. As far as
varying exp there are some differences in exp between mobs, If a mob on
average drops very good loot the exp will be lower then a mob that doesn't.
Prime example in Rathe Mts Hill Giants (34-39) drop on average 20-25p the
exp is very low compared to a 35 Troll Guard that drops 2-3p on average. I
can kill say 35 Hill Giants of various levels and make 300-400p with a
partner and get 1 yellow bub of exp and kill 35 Troll guards all 35 with the
same partner and get 2-2.5 Bubs of exp and only 50-75p. Only counting plat
dropped. So there is some give and take with exp and plat, but for the most
part the exp is pretty close
