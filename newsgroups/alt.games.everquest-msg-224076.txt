LOL I was going to write a very similar reply but you said it all.

The interesting question is whether this is inherent in any support
organization or a function of corporate culture. I remember reading
transcripts of a conversation with Smedly in which he essentially said "Fuck
the customer" (please don't ask for the cite, I'll plead up front to not
being able to find it, but I recall it). Corporate culture starts at the top
and if the head honcho has that kind of attitude, you can bet that the guys
on the line are going to be allowed to be just as stupid as they want to be.
In those cases, upper level managers will sometimes intervene to make things
right despite management and that may be what happened in this case.

I've known companies whose support organizations were populated by people
who really did give a shit about the customer experience and in those cases
the employees on the line will often go out of their way to find a solution
that makes the customer happy.

In general, though, you're right. Our usual interface to most companies is
through the bottom of the food chain and they're usually at the bottom for a
reason.
