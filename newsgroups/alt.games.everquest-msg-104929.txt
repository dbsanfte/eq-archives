Eq won't use the hard drive though. All you will need for the PS2 one
is a ps2 and a way for it to connect to the internet (at least that is
what all the press stuff says) Also this is NOT "Everquest." This is a
PS2 console VERSION of everquest. It is very likely to be as different
from our everquest as night and day. It has no zones but instead is
just a gradually loading world. If you look at the screenshots of what
look like an elven city, not only does it have railings around the
ramps but they are much lower to the ground (no gfay newbie death
falls)

It is going to be console game, made for console gamers. I might get a
PS2 just to try it if its different enough. They will obviously make
it more console gamer friendly by eliminating 45 minute boat rides,
long camps for rare loot, needing a guild to eventually do anything,
etc. For one thing it makes NO mention of needing a keyboard as well
as a hard drive. They said it would be very playable with the 56 k
modem or could work with the broadband adapter.
