ehm..
Environmental effects doesn't mean rain and snow. It means things like
crickets chirping and a few other effects as well afaik... the immersive
bits.

There is no way to get rid of rain and snow I'm afraid. They like thier
storms. I guess you could carry a high level druid in your pocket... they
can stop the rain.
