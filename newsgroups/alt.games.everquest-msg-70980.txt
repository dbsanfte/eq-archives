I think finding them cheaper would be a pretty big stretch, given the costs
involved in getting Tinkering to the point that Rebreathers succeed more
often than they fail, and that the only really practical use for a
Rebreather is the warrior epic. ;) (come on, do you wanna lug around a 10 wt
thing that eats your helm slot just so you can have EB? Buy a Fishbone
Earring or something. :)

I only know of 2-3 Tinkers on Rodcet that could be classified as "active",
though that doesn't really say much, since a *LOT* of tradeskillers like to
keep quiet about their skills, lest they be accosted at every turn. (See
Niami Denmother, of EQTraders fame0

The most active Tinker I know of charges 1.5k for them, I believe. However,
it's not uncommon to see them for 2-3k on Rodcet. Sever economies vary
greatly, as we all know... tradeskill items vary even more, in most cases,
being entirely dependent on the population of people who practise them. ;)
