"Horatio" <gooool@moonlink.net> thought (s)he was saying something
useful when (s)he said:

>I've benn looking for an RPG and I decided on this. 

If you are looking for roleplay; then I am afraid that you bought the
wrong game. As RPG without much R it is good though.


>Bought the trilogy and

It's not an actual card, is it? I recall I couldn't find mine either
in the trilogy box but still got 90 days free play.

Trees? I assume Kelethin city? Go to www.eqatlas.com for maps. You can
operate the lifts by clicking the handle next to them

You'll do well. Besides; people never really expect bards to talk a
lot as they want them to twist songs - which takes away a lot of
typing time.

I won't answer too much bard specific questions - as I never played
one myself.

Did you unstack them? If someone wants 2 of a certain thing then split
up the stack. Give the two silks in two different slots, but marked
with an (1) instead of in one slot marked with a (2)

As far as I know it improves the power of your song if you use the
right type of instrument.

Yes. Especially as a bard you will be extra effective in a group. Most
people should solo until level 5 or 6 or so - but then it will be a
lot of fun grouping at orc hill or crushbone. When you are in a group,
tell in the group that you are new in the game. You will make mistakes
- everyone new did - and people will explain what you did wrong in
that situation if you told them you are new. If you didn't tell them
you are new, they will most likely get mad at you for being "stupid".

No real protocol on this one. If someone feels the urge to throw a
heal or a buff (a spell that makes you stronger) on you, without you
asking them then just be glad you did. If you know his name then yoou
can "/tell name thanks". I know my 35 druid (retired as I moved to
another server) always blew all mana on heals and buffs if mana was
not needed and he ran through a low level zone.
Remember though; they don't have to heal you - but most people often
are willing to help the lower levels a little with heals or buffs

Don't think about tradeskills until you are level 40 or so. Until then
it is a waste of time and money.
