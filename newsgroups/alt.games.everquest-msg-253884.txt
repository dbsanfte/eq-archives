The regulations have changed some.  The smaller trucks have the same 
standards as cars now.  Others are allowed to pollute more, but, not

regulations start to get relaxed at over 3750lb GVW.

I recall that particular bit myself actually.  Not in relation to 
replacing them with SUVs, but with newer vehicles in general.
