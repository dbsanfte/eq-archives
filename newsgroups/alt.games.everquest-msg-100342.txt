I myself thought EQ was high at $10 bucks a month.. I love EQ, and will most
likely renew for a multi month account before price goes up, then will just
1 month at a time, and only get EQ every once in a while now, instead of
just keeping it on all the time, I know prices go up, and I can understand
that they have to pay too.. but for them its all gravy, they have to be
making money or they wouldn't have kept EQ running as long as they did.. I
hate to have to pay, to play a game. I also think its unnessesary, but EQ is
fun and I have friends there I enjoy visiting with. I am not going to cry
that the price is going up, I am simply disapointed. I wonder if they lose
enough players, if they would end up lowering the price to keep it $10 a
month.

 Man just owning a computer is getting as expencive as owning a car.. lol
you have to pay for your computer ( then $50+ a month for broadband) then
$10+ (now $13) a month for EQ, and so on, and so on.. I don't know, prices
always seem to go up and up, I just wish they would raise my wages everytime
the price for something else went up too.. 3 bucks isn't so bad in over all
scheme of things its just to bad once they have a good thing going they
couldn't just leave it as is..
