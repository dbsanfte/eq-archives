No, a guild that is run *to* their liking, even if they're not happy with 
some of the decisions. If it's not to their liking they're long gone.

Of course! And I wasn't talking about consensus qua consensus, I was using 
the term to characterize a *type* of decision and in that regard feel free 
to use whatever the consensus definition is for the word consensus. ;-) 
Whether that's "universal" or just "most everyone" really doesn't matter, 
the point is that a consensus decision is one in which the specific decision 
is made by the group rather than by an individual. Having the guild leader 
alone decide who gets a guild invite is a command decision. Putting it up to 
a vote of the membership is a consensus decision.

Yep, up to here we're in agreement.

It's not necessarily "considerable empowerment", it's "empowerment 
sufficient to discourage dissent" whatever that threshhold may be. And even 
in a gaming guild that threshhold will vary widely depending on 
circumstances. If I were the leader of Fires of Heaven in 2001, I might be 
able to demand that everyone in the guild be available and on call for 
raiding 40 hours a week and abide by my loot decisions or else they get the 
boot, and yet find that I'm able to wield enough empowerment to have a long 
waiting list of applicants and no dissenters. There may be some who hate the 
fact that some disproportionate percentage of my loot allocations are made 
to friends and officers, but the fact that they have a shot at it at all 
keeps them from dissenting. That's sufficient empowerment to change 
behaviors, even in a gaming context.
