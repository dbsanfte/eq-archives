Well, it got a little better. Finished patching, logged on and got a
nice monk partner for an hour, got my level back after 1 kill, ended
up with a little more exp than I'd started the night with, and one of
my friends let me borrow his shoulder for venting. So, aside from
being sick today... :)
(My next attempt at getting in over my head is scheduled to happen in
Lower Guk with guildies tomorrow night. At least I shouldn't fall off
a cliff or crash trying to get *there*)
