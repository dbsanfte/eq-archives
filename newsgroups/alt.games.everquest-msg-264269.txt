You're right.  They're not as popular in groups as they used to be.
They're more popular, due to the distinct lack of shaman healing spells in
the last two expansions.

The real value of porting to a group has not been significantly diminished.
A druid (or wizard) can evac you if things start to go bad, and prevent a
total wipe.   The PoK books are sadly inadeqate for this purpose.   Never
have I seen a group invite a porting class because they want a port to the
location they will be fighting.

Hate to break it to you, but with buff whores that is already in the game.
Enchanters get less groups than they normally would because one of the main
advantages of inviting them can be had for 50 pp in PoK.

So don't cast it.   Rude people are everywhere.   They weren't any nicer to
druids when they needed ports either.   Hell, from what I remember it was
much worse then.   A constant stream of tells "Hi can u leave your group in
Sebilis come 2 Lesser Fay and port me 2 commonlands plz?  Will donate 10pp"
"Why not?"

You still have this completely bass ackwards.   Having your class have buff
sellers in PoK *hurts* their ability to get a group, not improves it.  If
you want regen or damage shields, you have to invite the druid to the group
and bring him along.   Compared to KEI, where if you want that... just hand
over 50 pp to the buff whore and start looking for another DPS for that
group slot.

As for your shaman comment... you really think their popularity is due to
porting being "unneeded"?   Shaman popularity is due to the slow line of
spells being overpowered.   Seriously, I can't imagine a group that
purposely fights mobs unslowed, tripling the healing burden on each fight,
just to save 15 minutes in arriving to their fighting location.   If you
feel that a shaman would be more fun to play, go for it.   But I suspect
you'll be in for a rude awakening when you reach the last two expansions,
and find that they cannot continue to efficiently play a healing role in a
group, while druids can.
