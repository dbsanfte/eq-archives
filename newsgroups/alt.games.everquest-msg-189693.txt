So I had surmised. :-)

The % fail chance on Taunt should be eliminated when it is maxed, IMO, and
have it *only* be maxable by Warriors. Or else have *some* other way to
have warriors more reliably grab aggro.

Otherwise warriors will always lag behind the other tank classes for
grabbing aggro:
- Paladins with chain stuns and heals
- SKs with DOTs, lifetap, aggro-enhancing spells
- Rangers with Snare (and a couple more I can't recall).

I'm fairly certain my cleric can grab aggro off a warrior pretty easily,
basically using the paladin aggro methods. Not that I would typically
want to do so.
