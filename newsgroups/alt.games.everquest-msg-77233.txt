|Arrow was simply "a flight arrow" I believe (perhaps without the "a").

	Flight arrows were range 150, and taken out of the game a long time ago.
They were the vendor-supplied long-range arrow, removed (along with "sheaf
arrow", the high-damage arrow) to promote crafted arrows.

	I *sell* Shaped Shadewood Compounds (range 200 crafted bow).

	Shadewood was added in the Luclin expansion.  Until mid-December the only
way to get a range 200 bow was via drop or quest (Raincaller), and that was
the max.  If there is a longer-range bow it was also added since Luclin.  No
one has reported any change to the drops from pre-Luclin encounters that might
drop such a bow, and no high-level bows have been found dropping in Luclin.

	Shadewood's range matches the longest-range dropped bows so that Fletchers
have something to sell again.  Bows from Kunark and Velious had killed the
trade.  At 21/39 the ratio on a Shaped Shadewood Compound doesn't match the
tradable bows from Dragon Necropolis, but those bows are not sold often and
when they do they sell for thousands.  SSC's sell for around 2K, a tidy profit
if your luck holds on the combines.  (They are confirmed as never going
trivial.)  I would hardly say that Shadewoods are the "best"; I don't even use
one myself.  (I use an Underfoot for the stats and general sniping, and a
Huntsman for bowkiting and Trueshot work.)
