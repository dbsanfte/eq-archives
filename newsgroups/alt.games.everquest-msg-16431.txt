I did something close once. In that same zone. Druid my Necro was
partnered with accidentally got two mobs on a pull, so I peeled one
off and did my best to kill it fast and then catch up to my partner.

Trouble was that I had used too much mana killing the first one and
thus the second almost waxed us. BTW - The one I peeled off was a
Devourer...

My comment? "I think I overcast on the Sperm."
