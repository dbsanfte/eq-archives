Keep Screaming Terror and Shock of Poison up.  ST will help you split mobs
(it also wipes aggro) and Shock of Poison is a very good DD spell.

Lineup should be...

FD
Siphon Life
Screaming Terror/Allure of Death/Leatherkin/Major
Shielding/Harmshield/Intensify Death (rotate as necessary)
Shock of Poison
Leach
Pet buff/heal/summon and Fear
Engulfing Darkness
Heat Blood

Of course, you can rotate spells any way that is comfortable, but this
worked for me.  Add Heart Flutter instead of ST if adds are not a problem.
