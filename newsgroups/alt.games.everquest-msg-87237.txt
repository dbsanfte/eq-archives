| Any of you EQ mavens out there able to help me?
|
| Two days back my *Current Target* window disappeard from my full screen
mode.
| It's still there when I switch to the windowed view. Any ideas as to what
may
| have happened?  I ran a complete file check, total virus scan etc etc etc.
Did
| I hit the wrong button? If so what can I do to get it back up? Do I need
to
| uninstall EQ and reinstall? <groan>
|
| It really slows me down and  penalizes my group mates because it takes far
| longer to tarrget a particular MoB. don't think the EQ intent is to play
in
| windowed mode.  And as you may have expected, *nonTech Support* was
somewhat
| less than supportive.
|
| Thanks in advance
