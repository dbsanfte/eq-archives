Do you really think I "found" this newsgroup only because of EQ2?

Now granted, I *came* here because of EQ2, lurking for the most part for 
quite a while except for some crossposting, until the histrionics started.

But "found"?    I "found" this group years ago.

Pardon me if I'm reading things the wrong way, but you come across to me 
like someone who believes that everyone who didn't post to this group the 
day it was created just had a computer dropped in their laps yesterday.

If you need to email, then chainbreaker (naturally) at comcast dot
net--that's "net" not "com"--should do it.
