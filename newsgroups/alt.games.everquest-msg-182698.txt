My most annoying experience on PVP, Played a cleric on Talon Zek.  In 
HHK there was a fighter and monk sitting, both at about 1 bubble in the 
zone in from Kithicor.  Being a relatively easy going cleric, I heal 
them, then they proceed to pound me into submission because "They are 
not so weak as to need heals"  As if a cleric healing their wounds makes 
them less of a boy.  So, bound in Rivervale, I run back and try to get 
my corpse, and the monk beats me 'til I'm unconcious but not dead.  Then 
keeps me there for about 15-20 minutes by kicking me if I get up.  I did 
have a 45 necro friend who came and whomped on 'em for a bit, but it was 
annoying to say the least.  Glad I play on Fenin Ro now.
