The thing you're missing here, as others have pointed out, is "proof".
By recovering your corpse, indeed even by moving it, you wiped out any
evidence that what you claim happened actually occurred. By not doing
a /report of the 'bug damage', you failed to provide any evidence.

For all the GM knows, you were doing nothing but attempting to scam
him.

>I had a conversation (which turned quite heated) with a GM

Without fail, every instance where I've dealt with a GM, they've been
polite and professional. I strongly suspect if your conversation
became heated, it wasn't because of the GM.

>I had a blast while playing, but this is a matter of principle. 

Would this be similar to the principle where you make racist comments
to people because their name sounds Hispanic?
