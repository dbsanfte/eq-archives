What I can't find (and flame away cause I didn't bother to read the .txt 
file yet) is a listing of how to use the chat boxes, bazaar commands, 
viewport, etc. For example, and I only played around with it for a 
little while, is how to block out OOC? I click on it and it says it's 
sending it to the main chat box. I right click on it and it says its 
sending it to the main chat box. Stupid question.. how do I turn OOC 
off?
