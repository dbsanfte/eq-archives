We know the servers are down.
We know you troll or never/rarely/cant be bothered  to post to this group on a
regular basis.
So how about instead of starting a dozen new messages that eq sucks/suxxors/is
a piece of shit      you can all write them here. 

That way you get a chance to share that tiny piece of your ego that needs to be
aired every once in a while.

And the regulars can just ignore your  - i feel sorry for me/doac is
better/petty whines and get on with helping people  with genuine
problems/questions

Everybodies happy


Dandaro lvl 25  Probably dead kiting wooly mammoths in everfrost, but who cares
                       Its only experiance that i can get back tomorrow night.


Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.
