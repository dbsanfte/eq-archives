He provided the reason for adding the alternate flagging elsewhere, as 
did I.  It was added to allow guilds to flag new guildmembers without 
having to go through the entire progression yet again to backflag 
someone.  The side quests do not require reagents from the zone you want 
to be flagged for, they require a raid (not necessarilly a large one) 
that has most of the people flagged already (enough to gimp in the 
unflagged).  The one exception I know of off hand is the alternate quest 
for Sol Ro access which involves killing a mob that many classes can solo 
in Western Wastes.
