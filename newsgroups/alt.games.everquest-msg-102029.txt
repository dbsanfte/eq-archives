I have been playing a Barbarian Warrior on the Innoruuk server since June of
2001.  His name is Brakous.  His original guild was Infinite Wrath.  The
guild started out with me and several of my coworkers getting together for
some online gaming.  Since last summer the company we worked for has closed.
Keeping in contact has been difficult and many have quit the game
altogether.  I would like to join a guild that has a steady flow of raiding
and questing.  Here is his equipment:

      Primary Melee: Centi Warhammer
      Secondary Melee: Blackened Alloy Longsword
      Ranged Weapon: Longbow
      Ear: Orc Fang Earring
      Ear: Orc Fang Earring
      Neck: Orc Fang Necklace
      Face: Fine Plate Visor
      Head: Crafted Helm
      Shoulder: Crafted Pauldrun
      Finger: Golden Fire Wedding Ring
      Finger: Glowing Stone Band
      Wrist: Crafted Bracers
      Wrist: Crafted Bracers
      Arm: Crafted Vambraces
      Chest: Crafted Breastplate
      Back: Cloak of the Ice Bear
      Feet: Dwarven Work Boots
      Legs: Crafted Greaves
      Waist: Thick Leather Apron
      Hands: Crafted Gauntlets


Here are is stats with bonuses for all the above equipment:

      Strength: 138 26 164
      Stamina: 105 13 118
      Agility: 87 3 90
      Dexterity: 70 9 79
      Wisdom: 70 7 77
      Intelligence: 60 4 64
      Charisma: 55 5 60
      Magic Resist: 45 4 49
      Fire Resist: 25 2 27
      Cold Resist: 35 22 57
      Poison Resist: 15 5 20
      Disease Resist: 15 2 17


With all item bonuses his HPs are 1828.

He is a great tank using his Weighted Ax as an opening weapon for usually 2
hits in the low 100s and then immediately switching off to the Centi
Warhammer and BA Longsword.  Taunting is maxed as well as 2HS and 1HS.  1HB
is almost maxed.

Brakous is my main character and is untwinked.  I live on the East Coast and
play evenings and nights.
