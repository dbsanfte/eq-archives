Buying an epic is not an option at all, it's nodrop, as are all it's
components.  Buying (for platinum) droppable gear in EQ is sanctioned
and encouraged - they created an entire zone and game mechanics for it.

Buying gear for RL money is absolutely no different than having someone else
play your character sometimes, whether you pay them or just share an account.
There's nothing anyone can do about this, and it doesn't cause anyone any
harm.

Nope, monopoly is a zero-sum game where you are competing against other
players.  EQ is a much richer game, and it doesn't matter that there are
players with effectively infinite resources compared to you.

>The vast majority of the playerbase raids and selects where they go to 
>hunt based on potential rewards.

Agreed.  All humans select all actions based on potential rewards.  Not always
correctly or rationally, but it's a fair starting point.

>The primary reward in EQ is items.

That's insane.  The primary (and ONLY) reward in EQ is fun.  The only
reason to spend one minute doing anything that doesn't entertain you in EQ
is that you think it will lead to greater entertainment later.  

It's likely that items lead to fun, both because it's nice to have a reward
for surviving a risk, and because items enable you to do fun things you
couldn't without the item.

The reward feeling of it is purely internal.  It's equivalent to making a good
meal at home.  It has value because it's yummy and nutritious.  You get
rewarded for your effort.  The fact that it's available from a restaraunt for
a price doesn't detract, in fact it adds to the value, because you're saving
money.

Same for in-game equipment.  Getting it in-game has some value from the use of
the item, some from the internal reward of setting and achieving a goal.  If
it's for sale elsewhere, it has additional value in that you're saving money.

>rapidly find it boring to engage content with no reward.

Unlikely edge case.  Typically it would be VERY expensive or impossible to
buy enough stuff that there is nothing left to get (though you could hire
someone to play a character most of the time, and you just do it when you
want the fun of playing that character).   

And even in that edge case, you STILL get the fun of hanging with your friends
in the endgame zones that are quite challenging and interesting even WITH the
best equipment in the game.

I know it's more than 20, because the vast majority of my friends and
acquaintances who play also realize it's just a game, and the only purpose is
entertainment.  Sure, we all forget this sometimes, and think it's about
in-game achievement or lewts or whatnot, but that passes.

I honestly can't imagine what it must feel like to think the game is about
loot rather than fun, though I know some do.  I'm sorry if you're chronically
unhappy that people have better stuff than you, or that they didn't "earn" it
by suffering like you, or that Sony has stolen part of your life by forcing
you to play this game.  

And I'm delighted but a bit confused if you actually like the game, but think
it's about loot or advancement rather than about fun self-assigned challenges.

These people are already disgusted that every asshat with more
time/friends/money/etc. have surpassed them.  Oh, and those who are _IN_ the
top few percent, gear-wise, are disgusted that every asshat who plugs along
and just has fun in the game can "achieve" things they did a year ago without
suffering all the pain they caused themselves.

Umm, it's been happening for years.  It's all no-drop, so you have to buy a
character rather than items.  And it's more than a few bucks - does this
matter?  

>If you can buy any item (including the epics, per the argument at hand) 
>guilds will not bother to progress through zones to earn them.

Depends on price, and on what value the epics have.  If they go for USD$2000,
I don't think most people would buy them, and in fact might value the quested 
epic even more highly.  If they go for $10, a lot will buy them for the
in-game utility, and the ability to do different fun things than they could
without the epic.

Figuring out the correct pricing _IS_ an interesting question.  Claiming
that the entire concept is game-destroying is just wrong.
