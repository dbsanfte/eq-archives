I'm shooting for not making it a 'collossal waste of their time', not 
making it the 'best use of their time'.

It would really depend on just how much tribute they were worth now 
wouldn't it. At some tribute value they are worth "farming", and at 
another they are merely worth "looting" if they happen to drop.

I'm shooting for worth 'looting' not worth 'farming'.

Presumably you get your 10th X before you get your 2nd Y. X will rot, 
while you still need some Y's. Throwing those X's into tribute wouldn't 
be a bad thing.
