My, at the time level 17, enchanter got trained on zoning in to Kithikor,
died on the spot.  I ran back from EC, zoned in, a level 60 cleric was there
rezzing some others that got trained (and incidentally accused me of
training them).  Up pops the rez box for me asking if I want to accept a 96%
rez.  I was very tempted to click no, and just loot and scoot.  I didn't,
because I thought that would be rude, and instead wasted some time waiting
for rez effects to wear off.  At that point, it takes me one high dark blue
mob in Paludal to recover the lost xp, or one white to yellow Griffawn in
NK.

On a side note, I may not have mentioned this yet, but I am amazed at how
well my enchanter solos at these levels.  I created her strictly to buy
Mithril for my ranger, but, then I played her.
