The classes referred to as the Holy Trinity are Cleric, Enchanter, Warrior.
These are the Classes that most will insist upon in a Raid, the do their
respective jobs better than any other class and as such are less versatile
than other classes.
Warriors kinda become redundant, in raids, at more than 3 where a better
damage dealer can be added instead. I doubt anyone puts a similar limit on
Clerics or Enchanters.

You should focus on finding a class you enjoy playing and take that to the
High levels (or at least into the 50's) you will find with a decent Guild
and attitude you will get on raids anyway.

The Druid popularity problem stems from 2 sources, idiots playing Druids
thinking they have right to do what they like because they don't need a
group and idiots thinking that because a Druid isn't in a group he doesn't
have any rights but should be willing to drop everything and come and
sow/buff/port them.
