Just took my chanter over to ECommons (she's 13) to kill some wisps and make
some cash. Dunno why, but that girl is *broke*. Anyway, I summon my pet,
find a wisp, starting casting on it and then beating on it a bit, then
discover that it looks like my pet can't hit the things. I couldn't be sure,
because I had two of them on me and I ran like Aunt Addy's undies. I've got
a magic feather of some sort that a friend gave me (can't recall what it is
now), so I -can- hit them... anyone know if pet can too or was I
hallucinating?

TIA

Darklet, druid of *almost* 18 seasons

Thanks for playing.
