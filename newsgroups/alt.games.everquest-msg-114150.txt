If your cancellation occurred after the latest charge, even the day
after, I think you're pretty much stuck. Also, if you called/emailed
before the latest charge, but not early enough to stop the latest
charge, you're probably stuck as well. Just ensure it is now cancelled
and play out your last billing cycle.

Few pre-paid services offer refunds, and if you decide to quit, it's
always best to ensure you do so early enough for it not to be a
problem.
