Everquest is similar to Jedi Knight or the original Descent... All 
movement is handled by the client, therefore there is no discernible 
motion lag even under terrible network conditions. Of course, even if you 
don't lag, you will see the monsters and other players warp all over the 
place if you are dropping packets.
