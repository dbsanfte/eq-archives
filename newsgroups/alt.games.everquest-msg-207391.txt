    They've been doing a lot of polls and information-gathering recently.
This is a good thing. I hope.

    Apparently the revamped zones are pretty blah. Not a lot to interest
folks, other than the new loot which does look level-appropriate in Nurga.

    I'm sort of disappointed with this. They have problems creating content
that people are interested in and will return to, and they waste resources
on temporary content? I guess a lot of people want a changing game world, at
least until they find out what that involves.

    This excites me. This zone is very accessable, and could be excellent
long-term content if the revamp is done right.

> - Plane of Earth B - we have removed the Call of the Hero restrictions in
this zone.

    Earth-B is set up as follows: there's three areas, in a line, separated
by sealed doors. If all the mobs in area X are dead, the door to area X+1 is
unlocked. The area by the zone contains just trash mobs (trash mobs that hit
for 800+, but still just trash mobs), the next area has the three mini
nameds that drop one elemental pattern/item each (when all three are killed,
a fourth elemental dropper spawns that has two drops IIRC), and the final
area has the Rathe Council encounter. Rathe Council encounter takes hours to
complete. 12 mobs with a ton of HPs and some really dirty abilities have to
all be brought down to within a hair of dying, and then killed quickly. If
all 12 are dead at once, the boss spawns that gives the Earth flag for Time.
So now, if people log on mid-event, they can join the raid.

    Triton's web board update worked! For those that don't read those sites,
Triton was preparing to engage the final mob in the RZ event, Rallos Zek the
Warlord. To get to him, the fastest way is to levitate and fall down into
the very deep pit he spawns in. He doesn't aggro on people that do this as
long as you hug the wall on the way down. Well, one person took an extreme
disliking to Triton spawning RZtW in the middle of his XP session in that
pit (it's the most popular part of the zone for XP). So as they started
levitating down, he pulled RZtW right underneath them. He was the first one
to get aggro, so RZtW teleported every member of Triton to various places -
Plane of Sky beside the death-touching Spiroc Lord, Kedge in the middle of
Phinigel's room, Hate in Maestro's room, Fear on top of the Amygdalan Knight
temple, etc. Now THAT is grief!

    Most of those are used as raid zones, and rarely XP zones. The HoH
increase should be nice for folks, though.

    Oh, I hope this isn't broken, or didn't break something else.

    Fix the collapsible sewing kit so it can do all Velious combines,
please! Oh, and look into that salmon thing on EQTraders - having the exact
same combine make different things depending on the container is a bad idea.

    Woo-hoo! The time and mana savings with these is pretty big, too.

    Does anyone know yet if the damage increase is random?

    Hrm. Ok, two questions. One: if a paladin stuns a mob that is mezzed,
then hits the mob, is the mob still stunned after mez breaks? Two: if a
paladin breaks a mez with a stun that has a DD component, is the mob still
stunned?

> - Ferocity - We have removed the component requirement for Ferocity.

    Now the BSTs will be bugged endlessly for buffs. Poor kitty. :-(

> - Kindle - We have added a new Magician spell to the game called Kindle.

    It's a mana regen spell for pets, presumably so the new fire pets don't
go OOM as fast as they have been.

Force of

    4 second stun, mobs up to level 61, casts in 1 second, 12 second recast
time, has a -30 resist mod, 90 mana cost, level 53. That's one nice stun.

> - New Spell levels for Clarity line - Boon of the Clear Mind is now a

    This makes sense. Now hopefully they'll look at shuffling around some of
the level 50ish heals for clerics, which suffer from a similar "clumping"
problem.

> - Target Group Buff - TGB will no longer work with any illusions.

    I'll miss The Bazaar being filled with wolves. :-(

> - Draught of Lightning - We have added a new Wizard spell to the game

    This is Draught of Thunder (63 WIZ spell, fast-casting magic-based
damage) without the stun component. Wizards had complained about how the
only magic-based Draught they had was an aggro magnet because of the stun
thing.

> - Ornate Armor Molds - These molds are more readily available.

    Combined with the changes to the quest NPC, I forsee more twinks in
Ornate armour!! ;-)

    Spellshield is an effect that used to take a set amount of magic-based
damage away every time you were hit. So Spellshield: 40 would deduct 40
damage from every spell and AoE that hit you. 40 was about the biggest I'd
ever seen on an individual piece of armour, and players had complained how
useless this was against 3000 damage AoEs like they had to face. I wonder
what the individual numbers have been changed to (is SS: 40 now SS: 2%, 1%,
0.5%?), I wonder if they still stack like they used to, and I wonder if the
percentage damage reduction comes before or after the resist check?

> - Strikethrough and Stun Resist - You will now receive a message when
Strikethrough

    The reason being that players who parse such things complained these
effects were doing nothing. (They're effects on items in Time. Nobody yet
knows what, if anything, they do.)

> - Sneak - Sneak will now work under water.

    WOOT! Rogues everywhere, rejoice!

> - Instill Doubt - Instill Doubt will now work if the Monk is using his
other skills.
> Previously, use of other skills such as a kick would cause Instill Doubt

    Wow. I wonder if they'll fix this for rogues, too (Backstab being greyed
out makes ID fail).

> - Raids - The creation of a group will now work from inside a raid.

    Thank Brell. You have no idea how much time could be wasted when a group
of two or less was invited into a raid, bugging the entire raid.

    Hope they manage to complete all the other stuff they have planned for
this month, like the zone updates and melee damage rebalancing. A lot of
people are very keen on those items.
