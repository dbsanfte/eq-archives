One twit was begging for cash from me.  I told him I never have spare cash
because I use it all learning jeweler.  He asked me again about twenty
minutes later.  I said "I already told you no."  His answer was, "No you
didn't."  I replied, "Yes, at the bank, I refused you then, and I refuse you
again now."  He replied, "You didn't make sense at the bank.  Why didn't you
just say no then?"

I guess we have to add to that old hack, "What part of NO don't you
understand?"  Make it say "What part of NO, NEVER, DON'T, NOT, GET LOST,
STOP BUGGING ME, or LEAVE don't you understand?"  Here.
