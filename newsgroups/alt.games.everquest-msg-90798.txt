I know how many of these the board gets but here is mine anyway. I am quite
bored with Oasis. I am looking for places to hunt for 2 characters. I am
usually only on for an hour or two on the weekdays, longer on the weekends.
So pickup groups are important to me. Also, I hate CRs, but then, who
doesn't? I have a 20 Human Bard, currently in WC. Also, a 15 Level Barb
Shammy also in Oasis. Both are ubertwinked. Suggestions on where to go? I
was thinking of taking the Bard to Unrest and the Shammy I don't even have a
guess. TIA
