I guess we'd have to parse to really settle this, but it strikes me that 
one or two mezzed is just as good as 3-4 mezzed. And even your mana 
inefficient nuke is still more dps for the mana than keeping an extra 2 
mobs perpetually mezzed.

Unless your puller takes an unreasonably long time to pull the loss of 
his dps for the time he goes and grabs some adds should be irrelevant.
