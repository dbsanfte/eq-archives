Beastlords can certainly aggro kite, as others have mentioned in this
thread.  It's not as effective as other classes, but it can be done
since we have some very effective aggro spells (slow, incapacitate,
and poison DoTs which add poison counters each time they are cast,
even if the previous one hasn't run out yet).  We can even get a pet
snare AA or give the pet a snare proccing weapon to help out, and some
of our pet proc buffs have a negative hate associated with them
(although they do still stun, so there is some hate generated, and of
course the hate from the pets quadding is substantial too).  In fact,
most of the Beastlord 1.5 epic mobs that pop singly can be aggro
kited...the biggest exception I can think of is the Ailing Walrus in
Siren's Grotto since it's indoors and there's no room to kite. 
Although I wouldn't do it that way myself if I could help it...I'd
much rather have a healer class friend along so I could simply tank
them...or possibly even pet cleric although I think they hit too hard
for that (at least until I get the next pet proc buff that can stun up
to level 66 mobs).

Game on,
