What you -can- do is drag your primary slot ("main hand" to the OP) to one
hotkey, and an inventory slot to a second hotkey, then swapping  items is a
simple matter of clicking on the inventory slot hotkey  (where the other item
you want lives), then on the primary slot hotkey to swap items, then again on
the inventory slot hotkey to get the former primary slot item off your cursor.

If you want to swap back and forth a lot, its even simpler; hold your
alternate item on your cursor, hovering over the primary slot hotkey, and
click to swap, then click to swap back when you are ready to do that.

My bard, for example, has a primary slot weildable string instrument.  Once
per twist, just as his healsong is about to finish casting, he swaps this in
for his weapon, and about a second later swaps it back out, minimal
interruption to his melee output, but nearly doubling his HP regen output for
having an instrument equipped instead of just singing the song.

Of course bards are a nightmare version of this practice, I have not only both
primary and secondary slots but four inventory slots hotkeyed on one of my
pages, so I can "Juggle" instruments and weapons in and out of both slots
while simultaneously twisting four and a half songs.

If there was a way to actually swap items in and out of slots by pressing
hotkey buttons, instead of having to click on them (or on the sltos
themselves) with your mouse, every good bard in the land would probably pass
out from sheer joy (mediocre bards, who don't juggle, would wonder what all
the fuss was about)
