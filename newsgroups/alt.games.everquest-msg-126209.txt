Toshiba Satellite 
P4M-1.7GHz
512DDR
GF4-Go 32MB
15" UXGA+ LCD
$2499 at CompUSA when I bought it.

All models turned on. Graphics option cranked up. Runs great - *very*
close to the performance of my butt-kicking desktop PC. The time of
high-powered games on a laptop is here my friend. The only downside is
that just like PCs, you know that once you make your purchase, you
know the next best thing is right around the corner.  :)
