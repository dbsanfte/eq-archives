I don't entirely agree, but I do think you have a point.

I disagree.

That's not the impression of history I have.  More of an "oops, we
might want this in here...."   Formal declerations of human rights-
and the whole concept of such - are relatively modern things.

From a

I don't agree with that interpretation, but I don't really care to
debate the US Constitution and/or related court precedents.  Totally
unimportant to me.

That was more or less my feeling when I left a certain job.  I did
file an incident report with the union, mostly in the hopes that
eventually they could prevent the same situation from happening to
others, but I had no interest in working for people who only valued my
work when they could assume I was straight.

Rights in the US are not more- or less- stable for being part of the
1st amendment than they are in a country with a living constitution
(odd term, its not like yours is dead, but I didn't invent it).  The
actual realization of those rights is still subject to precedent,
ability and willingness to enforce the law, and court rulings.
