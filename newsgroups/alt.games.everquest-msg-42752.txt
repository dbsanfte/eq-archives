Yes, I'm having the exact same problems, and had to go back to 12.41.  I'm
running Windows 2000, by the way.  I noticed the folks that say they are not
having problems are running 9x or ME... anyone *not* having problems with the
latest drivers running 2000?  I have a GeForce 2 GTS.

Bummer too, because they were much better performance (15% in my benchmarks)
and solved a long standing packet loss problem with EQ.
