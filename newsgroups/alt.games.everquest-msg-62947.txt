Moderately true. At level 55 in EW I purposely sacrificed about 50
wisdom swapping stuff out for my vendor deliving charisma kit instead.
This got my wood elf druid to about 135 charisma. I then proceeded to
charm the higher level rhinos (they are up to light blue rarely after
that change) and really found not much difference beyond chance from
that level of charisma and by base 80 or so.

This is why im greatly looking forward to the "perm charm" skill for
druids in Luclin which you can dump xp into. However, I will wait for
some other guinea pig druid to try it out to see if it sucks or not
(like if it has a low level limit of level 25 mobs or crap its
pointless) If I could perm charm say a rhino in EW (even the lower
versions of those are pretty dang tough.. way better than my bear pet
"Dies a Lot on Low lizards in Cazic thule" )  or the panthers you
mention below in WL I'd be VERY happy with that skill.
I'd imagine whatever it works on the thing stays charmed until you
die/zone since its called "perm" charm skill.

Those panthers are dang buff.
