WoW has a whole lot going for it, I really have mixed feelings about it. 
It's a gorgeous game with terrific ambience and so much style, I love just 
being in it. Maybe the gameplay will improve after release, I don't know, 
because I've already stopped playing it. But I'm going to keep an eye on it 
and hope that Blizzard is able to make some adjustments as a result of input 
from the stress test. Ben may be right that it's too late in the cycle for 
this mechanic to change, but I don't know. There are still major things that 
aren't yet in, so it's possible they did the stress test earlier in the 
cycle than it appears. We'll see.

Yeah, DAoC is a good example of a game that was really a lot more fun to 
play at release than it probably is now. Like all new releases, every 
achievement was first time on the server, and in many cases, first time 
overall, and had to be learned and strategized the hard way. The setbacks 
were greater, but the rewards were correspondingly much better too. But as 
you say, the biggest difference was that we all started RvR'ing as soon as 
we were able to get into the Frontier. That's probably not very do-able 
anymore.
