I've been in a guild and always liked having chars that guildies didnt
know about for those times when I really just don't want to be social. 
Some days I play to be with others, some days I play to get away by
myself.  I guess a modified version where several chars were in a single
guild might work out.  As for grouping my problem is more the opposite. 
I made good friends long ago and often get tells the instant I log a
char in asking me to come play, often times meaning logging out the char
I just logged in to bring in one better suited to the groups location.

And that is exactly how I meant that <EG> in my post.  Of course not all
folks with a guild tag have something to be ashamed of, but those with
certain tags are waving a flag that screams "I associate with known
idiots.", hehe.

th
Someone flame my punctuation in that last line please, I have no clue
what it should have been and will use it as a learning opportunity <G>.
