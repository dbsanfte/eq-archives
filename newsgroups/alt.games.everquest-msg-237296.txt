Why is it?

I've twinked various chars to a high level of gear (shaman, mage, ranger,
enchanter, bard, rogue, SK) and I don't notice that 1 class is more
expensive than any other to equip...

The single most expensive "thing" when gearing in my experiences has been
flowing thought items (people see FTx and the price just inflates beyong
reality)

What does a beast need that a mage doesn't? Mana? Nope..  Hitpoints? Nope..
the vast majority of mana items does have hitpoints on it too, and vice
versa.  Focus effects? Nope.. Flowing thought? Nope..

If you percieve that a beastlord can do more, is wanted more, and thus is
worth spending 10x the money on, then thats 1 thing.  But they are still
both dependent on gear.  Give the mage more gear, he can nuke longer and
harder.. heal his pets more.. whatever is required from him, maybe even take
an extra blow should he pickup agro.

Unless of course you think a 2kmana 1khp magician has the same kindof group
impact as a 7kmana 6khp mage...

Btw this post covers youe other replies above too (the 150k line), not just
the small part I quoted above
