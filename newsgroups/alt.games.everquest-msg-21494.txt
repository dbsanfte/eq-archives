Yes, and provided you express yourself in /say /group or /guild.  I
won't whinge or complain about your language.... If its /ooc or /shout 
expect me to complain and if you repeat it /report /petition.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
