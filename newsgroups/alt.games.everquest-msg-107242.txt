    Oh yes.  Them.  Don't run into them if you are KOS to
dark elves.  The camp is static, and easily avoided. 
The last time I hunted in that area, it was with my necro, I
believe. Or perhaps my mage or wizard.  Whichever, I do
remember running up to them and having a spot of tea. 
Lovely people, really, if they aren't trying to kill you.
