    The posts were all over Steel Warrior, and warriors were on Monkly
Business firing off shots. Not to mention the constant stream of crap on
FoH's site. While you may not have been losing sleep over monk mitigation,
the other "frequent poster" warriors were angry about it.

    The big problem is the devs are Furor's sock puppets. They may think
they aren't, but when they believe his points without applying critical
thought to them they end up that way. And Furor's "vision" of Everquest is a
pretty self-serving one. Consider this summary of a few of his viewpoints:

    Warriors should be most able to take damage, by a wide margin. They
should also have the best ability to get a mob to hate them. They should
also have high DPS.

    Flags in PoP should go to the guild tag, not to the individual. High-end
loot should be handed out in the form of "tokens", totally generic items
that when handed to a quest NPC would result in a class-specific item for
that player. These items should be tradeable, but only to other guild
members. All other droppable items in game should have severe level/AA
restrictions on them, based on relative power.

    So, to rephrase: warriors should be the only viable tank in game. The
other two tank classes should be relegated to buff bitch status. Flags and
loot should be entirely re-done so when someone leaves a guild, another
person (like a naked server transfer) can be slotted in with minimal effort
required to gear or flag the newcomer. The rewards of playing would accrue
to a guild, and not directly to the people that play. People should not have
any method available to them, other than raiding or farming, to improve
their level of power and compete with those that have raided and farmed.

    It's the most dictatorial model I've ever seen for a game. I'm not
surprised he likes it.
