Perhaps. But I for one do not see these changes as anything but a
good sign, not a sign of the apocalypse of EQ. Many of the changes
I have wanted for a long time.

Hard to see how the death penalty will be totally removed. Lessened maybe
but gone? No. It would break the dependance on clerics. Hell they are
adding more rez spells to the Cleric already to help cusion the blow but
removal is out of the question I think.

It has always been my opinion that the Death penalty is too harsh in the game
already. For me just the CR is bad enough. You have to have a downside to
death, I think we can all agree, but as to how 'harsh' that penalty is to be can
be debated ad infinitum.

Just pipe dreaming here:
For me I wish there was a way for the game to distinguish HOW you died.
I never mind dying to my own mistake or from a risk I freely took. But
dying due to someone else's train, or dying from going Link Dead or lag
or a bug really pisses me off. Because I am being penalized for something
that was not my fault! The deaths to the game are identical and have the
exact same 'penalty.'

Now I know there is no way that the game can be coded to filter these
types of deaths from the others but if the death penalty was less harsh
it wouldn't be as much of a pain in the ass and frustration.

Thats exaggeration in extreme. EQ may become a little easier but that
is a far leap to 'god mode.'

I see nothing wrong with making some of the things in EQ easier.
Some of the recent changes like more teleports,  self-binders, etc.
have made the game much more enjoyable to me. They have made
the game easier but have not 'ruined' the game as far as I can see.

I disagree. That EQ is hard is true, and that is only 1 aspect that
makes it a challenging game. It is not the only thing that makes it a "good"
game however.

Why should they care about the 'long term' health of the game? Nothing
lasts forever. One day EQ will be gone and all our characters are going
to be so much forgotten or erased magnetic signatures on a hard drive
in a dump somewhere.

They are probably trying to come up with any ideas they can to keep
milking this cow as long as possible before she gives up the ghost.
I know I would.
