This is something I've been thinking about recently and here is my
take, for whatever it may be worth.

Instant travel is popular.  Obviously, every new MMO that comes out
incorporates it.  So why do I have this nagging dislike?  Sure I like
being able to jump in a portal/on the back of a gryphon without all
that annoying running, agro, waiting but something about it bothers me.
 I think I figured it out.

Back in June of 99 I was sitting on the dock in Freeport, home sick and
lonely. I'd travelled all the way to Freeport to get my new bard song
(ONLY available there, not my native Kelethin) and it felt SO far from
home.  I didn't know anyone, I didn't know where I was, the city looked
different than any I'd seen and honestly I just wanted to go HOME.

There was an odd assortment of characters at the dock waiting for the
boat and a strange thing happened.  We started chatting.  Food and ale
was passed around (my little bard had never been DRUNK before!), jokes
ensued, swimming contests, etc.  I met a Paladin that day.  I knew him
for years, through him I met other friends who I was still playing with
in 2004 when I finally retired from EQ.

Relationships.  That's what is missing with all this instant travel. I
met more people waiting for the boat or acting as "bardic taxi" across
the Karanas than I've ever met in any other game.  There was more
chatting, more making friends.

In newer MMOs I have found that what happens is a group gets put
together with
these nifty lfg tools that require no conversation, everyone meets at
designated location, hunting ensues (usually with very little
conversation as down time has been nearly eliminated) and then group
breaks up.  I've yet to make "real friend" in any MMO since EQ1.

THAT is why I dont' like fast travel.  I miss sitting on the dock
getting plastered with 10 strangers who become friends.
