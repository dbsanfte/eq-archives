Doh!  Shows how much attention I've been paying when I've equipped one.

I don't think any of my nightblind characters has ever owned a perma
nightvision item.  They are generally such total crap items otherwise
that I just won't give up a slot for one, I'd rather deal with the
handicap in some other fashion.

I once drowned on a Kedge raid because somebody tried to hand me a
waterstone at exactly the wrong moment.  I had been inattentive and
didn't go after my stash of stones until I started taking damage,
the bit of lag as the trade window opened was just long enough to
prevent me from getting the stone into a top inventory slot and
clicking it.

Well, I think I already answered your question.  ;)

Hey, if we had slow maybe it wouldn't be such a bitch trying to find
a decent group.  I have learned to fear and loathe pickup groups more
than ever before since my Druid made 50.

DPS.  High level Mages look to be an incredible DPS class.  A class
that gets great damage output from pets and yet has to worry about
agro from overnuking, I'm having trouble seeing how you miss that.
Oh, and btw, I know everybody seems to be in love with the focussed
water pet, but my favorite version of jabober was always the air
pet when fighting stunable mobs.  But then as a long time Paladin
I'm quite a fan of stuns anyway.

Well, as long as you're answering rhetorical questions I think I'll

go ahead and point out the irritatingly obvious:
Everybody knows that a well played Bard is functionally equivalent to
a demi-god, Bards simply aren't relevant to any sort of class balance
discussion because they simply aren't balanced vs. the other classes
in any way shape or form.
