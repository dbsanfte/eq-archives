    So that they couldn't screw up ever again. Let me explain. In PoP, a new
illusion was introduced, Scarecrow, as part of a buff spell. But that
illusion made the player non-KOS to most "hostile" mobs in the game. So
players, any player, could go anywhere and scout anything/pull corpses/move
past "blocking" content without problems. SOE finally had to disable the
illusion component of the spell, because they couldn't come up with a way to
have that model not be global non-KOS and have real mobs with that look stay
global non-KOS.

    This isn't an isolated problem. The same thing happened with werewolf
form during Velious in Velk's. The same thing happened with the illusion
introduced in Luclin (other than kitty). The same thing was going to happen
with Illusion: Scaled Wolf, which is supposedly a reward for a quest in PoK.
So instead of coming up with a way to ensure that illusions didn't change
faction that radically, while still preserving the faction-modification
possible with some of the illusion forms, the whole thing was nerfed. Now
the developers can put whatever illusions they want in game and not worry
about what the possible faction consequences will be.

    Druids and rangers don't have this problem. It's not changed for them.

    The two races aren't that hated by one another. If you're an agnostic
gnome, you could walk around in a lot of Neriak, right? The reverse is true
of an agnostic DE and Ak'Anon, I suppose. You being Warmly in gnome and
Amiable in DE would likely correspond to being Dubious in DE had you done no
faction work.

    Everquest has always been about changing the rules in the middle of the
game, in search of a "balanced set of rules".
