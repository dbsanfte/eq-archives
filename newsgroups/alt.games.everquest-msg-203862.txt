Common misconception, agility has zero effect on movement speed, it has 
been tested many times.  Things that affect movement speed are your 
connection quality, your encumbrance, and any movement modifying spells 
or AA abilities.  The reason that the misconception comes about is that 
when you are encumbered, among other effects, your agility is reduced.  
So, some brilliant soul decided that the reduced agility must be what 
causes movement speed reduction, rather than considering the possibility 
that both the agility reduction, and the movement speed reduction were 
the result of the encumbrance.
