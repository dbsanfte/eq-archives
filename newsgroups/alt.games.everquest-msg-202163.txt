Aren't some of the wing keys already there as ground spawns? or am I
just thinking of the keys to get to the boss mobs for each wing? 

Either way, I don't think making them ground spawns would help all
that much. It's still gonna take too long to get to the last two wings
for anyone to do it with a group and w/o a rogue. Nobody wants to
spend 2 hours in a dungeon to get to where they want to be, especially
given the difficulty of a CR there. 

My fix for chardok, make the drop-downs in each wing into an elevator
instead, kinda like the one in CoM that comes back down automatically.
Let people jump down and catch a ride up in the wing that they want.
Either that or fix what a lot of people think is the permanent key
quest for that zone.

Nurga was always one of my favorite exp zones in the 30s, always
empty, trivial to pull if you have a decent group of 3 or 4 people and
not really a 1-way design since you can swim up the water after zoning
in. 

Droga has always been a worthless zone imo. I guess you could crawl it
with a decent group around 40th lvl but why would you want to? Random
loot is non-existant, one mistake and you're puller bites it, corpse
runs are a bitch. Give me a good group of the right level and there's
a lot of dungeons I'd rather be in.

Put in some decent quests, maybe all my time hunting in Chardok will
pay off! <g>

Exp there really wasn't bad. Pre-pop we used to take 2 groups there
for exp relatively often. Given the mob density, pulling enough for 2
groups wasn't a problem and the loot was actually decent. Gating,
unstunable roamers is what kills that dungeon IMO.

The well isn't bad if you pull it from the bottom. Invis down, go to
the 4-way and pull the upper rooms to there intially. I always thought
SG was one of the coolest zones for a dungeon crawl. Pick a corridor
at random and see where you end up <g>. Pretty much light blue at 53
though, one of those zones I miss not being able to exp in any more.

Fix the locked door at the top of the tower so people can actually get
back out without a port.

Making the AoEs resistable would help CT a lot imo. It would make it
so you could hunt lizards w/o a chanter, something that's pretty much
impossible right now. 

LoY kinda restored my faith (after PoP), that SOE was actually capable
of still designing cool dungeons. Dulak, Nadox and Hate's Fury all are
nice designs imo. Just wish they were a bit higher level.
