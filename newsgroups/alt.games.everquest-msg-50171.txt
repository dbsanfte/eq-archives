Rich BTW is 9-15pp for a horse depending how fast you want it to run,
still slower then SoW the fastest horse, basically fancy looking
JBoots and much like JBoots it will be on the body when you die. As
for multiple horses I suspect that this will be for the people who pay
those absurd plat amounts for "unique" looking items who's only
advantage is a unique look with lame stats, purely vanity. Article
said horses will have different colorings.
