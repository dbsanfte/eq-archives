You do realize that every class in the game is capable of dealing damage,
right?

DPS isn't a role, it's a game mechanic.  Being the "best" at DPS might
qualify as a role.  Being "5th best" or "9th best" or "15th best" hardly
qualifies.  :)

That said, I find the concept of giving monks lull to be pretty bizarre. 
Beyond that, it's being done in a very half-assed way that doesn't seem like
it will actually solve anything, and *definitely* (as it exists now on Test)
still fails to provide a "role" for monks, i.e., if a group was going to
pick the enchanter, cleric, bard, ranger, druid to pull before, they are
still going to do so after this goes in.

I had, and offered, a much simpler, much more effective, and *much* easier
to implement "fix" for monks.  A lot of monks came up with similar ideas. 
One or two monks came up with "give monks lull" and were laughed at...  Go
figure, that's the one Sony picked to use.
