And actually, you really would not want the ST as the number two person on
the hate list.  That happened to me on our one Avatar of War attempt.  I was
the ST, and turned out to be number 2 on the hate list.  The combat went
something like this.

The Avatar of War hits Madog for 1100 damage.
The Avatar of War hits Madog for 1100 damage.

Madog is slain by the Avatar of War.

The Avatar of War hits YOU for 1100 damage.
The Avatar of War hits YOU for 1100 damage.
The Avatar of War hits YOU for 1100 damage.
The Avatar of War hits YOU for 1100 damage.
The Avatar of War unleashes a FLURRY of attacks on Dearic!
The Avatar of War hits YOU for 1100 damage.
The Avatar of War hits YOU for 1100 damage.
The Avatar of War bashes you for 800 damage.

You have been slain by the Avatar of War!
Loading... Please wait.
You have entered Plane of Knowledge.
Dearic assumes a defensive fighting stance.


You *need*  a 5 second minimum break in between tanks, even if it sacrafices
a few monks or rangers...  so that the heals can start landing on the new
person.   If you don't get that, well, with a 10 second cast time on
complete heal, you're very likely to lose the new tank.   And then half the
raid, while the third tank figures out whats going on and tha the suddenly
needs to taunt (and the clerics figure out he needs heals).
