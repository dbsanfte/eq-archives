At at least one point Sony even emailed everyone a 2nd CD Key to create 
a 2nd account with marketing speech along the lines of ... "have you 
ever wished you had your very own cleric to follow you around?"

and had to be subscribed separately after the free 30 days...but that's 
not the point... the point was the market-speech that came with it.)
