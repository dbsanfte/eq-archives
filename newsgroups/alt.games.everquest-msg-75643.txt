Hehe, must be some coding Verant has put in against Paladins ;-)

Although of course Ogres tend to have this problem too.  I was escorting an
ogre friend from the Inno/UGuk zone to LGuk, and we get to the ladder down
to the second level and he gets stuck just before it opens up into the room
down the ladder (I am sure I have seen other ogres get through there
before - might be new character models).  He tried for some time twisting
and turning and ducking to no avail.

So I had to stretch the limits of my memories remembering the other way
through the underwater area to the spiders.  Rarely have I got stuck myself
though (no I haven't treid the Lord's throne hehe), perhaps being half elf,
a smaller race of the Paladin races :-).  Although I don't know how it works
that High Elves can wear small and Half Elves can't.
