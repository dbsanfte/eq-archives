Just so you know... MQing something is something of a risk...  Guides and
GMs and even the reimbursement policy strictly state that if you MQ an item,
you are ON YOUR OWN.  If it fails, you are screwed.  They will NOT help you
and they will not give you back the item.

This is also the same situation when you "buy" someone to help multiquest
for things.  If you trust the person and they run off with your money/item,
you are pretty much screwed.
