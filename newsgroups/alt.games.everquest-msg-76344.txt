If a cleric doesn't keep my 51 chanter healed most of the time, I first tell
him he'll get no more clarity and if that doesn't work, I'll leave the group

I sometimes do need to explain that I haven't got quite as much hp as the
average tank. I do all this in group chat so the other people know what's
happening.
