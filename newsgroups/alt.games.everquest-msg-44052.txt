Actually, the reason nobody goes PvP in the PvE servers is because 
there *are* dedicated PvP servers. That doesn't mean that the switch is 
marketing BS, which would indicate some kind of dishonesty in the part 
of Verant. You *do* have a choice of PvP in a PvE server. Admittedly, 
you'd be an idiot to take it, but there is no BS anywhere.
