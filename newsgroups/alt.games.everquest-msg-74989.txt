You should be able to do that with ranged weapons if the target doesn't
close and take you out.

If you're powerful enough in EQ to kill something with one hit (like a
giant wasp or something), why should it stand to reason that said

creatures that could kill my lvl 7 Paladin in one shot but that I would
have no chance of even damaging!
