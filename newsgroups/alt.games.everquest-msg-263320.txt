I went to purchase OoW expansion in Best Buy on the first day of access.  It
was not in the store.  A clerk gave me eta of November 15 (or approximate,
did not make more than mental note); when I got clarification, I found this
was EQ2.  OoW was to come in the very next day.

Now, visiting Best Buy website I see this as delivery date for EQ2 by CD:
11/15-11/20/2004 .  Furthermore, I see three delivery modes there.  Here is
the link.  You will see what I mean.
