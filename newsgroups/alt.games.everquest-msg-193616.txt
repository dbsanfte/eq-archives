I hear this is the case. So much so I went out and bought the DS potion (the
biggest one) at about level 35... I was young and sad. I know!

Its like keeping a prized bottle of champagne ready to crack for a special
occasion...

So, you reckon at 51 with the DS, I can take him?

I am unlikely to improve my gear much by then, excpet weaponry - currently a
GSC and Stave of Shielding (STILL not proccing at 45...)
All gear is Acrylia (R/S) or Spider fur, Wrists are Sejah Ghukam bracer and
Steel threaded (?), Hands are SCHW's.
Ears- cougar claw, what on Norrath is better till uber levels??? Rings are
Velium fire.

All my own stuff, non twink, too.
/pride on
fall... you have taken 10k hits LOADING PLEASE WAIT...
/pride off

OK, I think Ill head off and level to 51 asap. THEN do the rest of this
awkward bugger quest.

Thanks for the feedback!
