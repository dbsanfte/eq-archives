And to add to that... guess what ... Outlook Express which came
preinstalled on their computers is a news reader... not the best of
course... but considering the price (free) and the amount of effort
you have to do to get it (none) and the fact that half of them
probably use OE for email already anyways... its probably not too
great a stretch for them to figure it out. 

Half a brain is too much... they just need a peanut ratting around up
there.
