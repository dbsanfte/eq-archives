I'm probably not a good person to answer this exact question
since I belong to a division of a guild that started out as
being a paladin and cleric only guild. We LOVE our clerics
(considering how they make up about 40% of our member base,
we better. LOL >

But, having said that, on Karana, what I've noticed lately
is not really aimed directly at clerics but kinda spread out
on *everyone* who doesn't particularly say 'How high?' when
they're told they need to jump. People getting rude because
their request for a SoW isn't instantly answered. People
being idiots because there's no one in PoK right that instant
selling KEI/Temp/Virtue/Whatever it is they want *right now*.
Definitely seems to be an epidemic of 'My play time is more
important than yours so do what I need you to do no matter
WHAT you're doing instead' attitudes, IMO.
