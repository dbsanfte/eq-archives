Yeah, and GMs have told us before that Laubatyip (or whatever the heck
it was) violated the naming rules, too. But to this date I don't think
anyone else has ever understood how.

GMs aren't infallible. Sure, a GM is the ultimate authority, unless of
course you can find another GM who doesn't agree.

Not entirely correct - lack of denial does not automatically imply
acceptance, and Graefaxe told the GM that he didn't understand how it
broke the naming rules.

>Perhaps those first 3 GMs don't speak French and the 4th one does.

Or perhaps it's the other way around. I don't speak French, but if
that name indeed translates to "Eagleheart", then the translation
doesn't break the naming rules any more than does "Steelheart" that
the GM offered.

If the rules disallow 'd' in cases where it's used as a sound-alike
replacement for 'the', then the next word had better sound like
something in English, too. Something that sounds like "The safdjhi"
isn't breaking the rules, no matter how much the GM squints and
drools.

The GM spent a lot of time placing the burden of checking the rules on
Graefaxe, but wouldn't herself (himself?) name the one being broken.

No indeed. But if a cop gives you a ticket without being able to tell
you *why*, wouldn't that cause you some concern? 
Cop - "Here's a ticket."
Driver - "What did I do wrong?"
Cop - "Go read the rules."
Driver - "Seriously, I don't understand."
Cop - "Co read the rules."
