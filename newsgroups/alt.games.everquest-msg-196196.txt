Hi Jenalle,

I looked up the skulls on www.google.com and the only think it came up with
was that they are for faction for the guy that gives the Vex Thal key.  look
here http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8818  just do a ctrl+f and
type in skulls=).. the bone powder, not really sure about that one.. i just
sold it to vendors or destroyed it
