Kerran Isle is off of tox forrest.
You have to swim the sea (Nothing dangerous that I have seen)

If you are KOS to the cats there (And have no illusions) then you can
always hunt the entrance guards (this is where people powerlevel). They
are just going lt blue to my level 18 so that makes them about level 13
(?).

I went to look at the cats last night.
I made the mistake of meeting the wild tigers.
Not that they would have been that bad (blue to me) however they seem to
be kill on sight to everyone, and get assisted by the cats that are near
them.
Still it is only a tem minute CR from panieele :-(

I think that I am going to give up on the pumas and try the entrance way
cat people next. They are mostly drk.blue to me atm, so with a good pet
with haste and slowed cats I should be ok <G>


The Rat quest is really easy. Kill the rat in the house (Sometimes
"named") and take his toe nail (or what ever it is) that he always
drops. Give it to the cat man at the end of the peir furthest from the
zone in.

He gives you a neclace and some xp.

Thats it.

HTH,

Jim
