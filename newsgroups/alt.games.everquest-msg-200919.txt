Just had an interesting thought cross through my highly disorganized 
mind...

Does int/wis/(sometimes dex) affect melee skill-ups (such as backstab, 
offense, piercing, 1HS, 2HB, etc)?  Or is it a simple matter of whacking 
the shit out of everything blue or higher?

Just a question, doesn't matter in the larger scheme of things, but the 
thought came to me and I had to ask :).
