I sold a bunch of Kiolas last night and this morning ( over 200 of them ) 
for 4pp each.  I sold padding for 20pp each.  I was the lowest price on 
both of them.

I haven't played in so long I almost forgot that you can turn all those MQ 
cat pelts that the cats drop into LQ with a skinning knife.  I was 3 
seconds from dumping all the MQs.  I'm not a smith, so I went to the Bazaar 
and lo-and-behold there is 1 skinning knife for sale for 1pp.  That knife 
got me 18 more LQ pelts.  The spiderling silk is the hard thing to find on 
my server - people are selling them for 5-15pp EACH in the bazaar.  I went 
to Ogguk and got a few stacks from the vendors there because Steamfont and 
the other places were sold out.
