And in doing so you make a copy of a work, move it to your computer,
and then link it so that you receive benefit from it. In our example,
you agree to a transaction with someone online, and in turn shift the
location of that item on Sony's servers using the processes for doing
it that their system allows. A copy of the item never exists outside
of their client.. you cannot link that item, only a description of it
offline.. and in turn the intellectual property is never removed from
the game. Care to handwave some more analogies that do not apply?

>I can't hand out burned CDs to my friends.

Nor can you hand out Blade of Carnages. Of course.. forgetting the
burning, would you argue that if you took $10K down to Tower Records
and bought 500-$20 discs that you could hand those out to all your
friends(on your own property of course) and have that be perfectly
legal? Furthermore, please illustrate how I can 'burn' copies of a
Blade of Carnage.

>I can't sell either without the permission of the copyright holders.

No.. but you could certainly sell originals that you yourself have
bought, and even trade those originals for others. Go to a swap meet
sometime. Seriously, if you want to make an analogy to burning
copies.. please tell me how to burn copies of Everquest items.

The copyright holders have final say in how their work is to be
copied. But once the work has been made, how it is distributed is
ultimately up to the person who buys it. I can sell CD's that i have
bought legitamitely anytime, anywhere.

>Selling a CD is legal.

Correct.

>Selling a copy of a CD and keeping the original isn't.

and Correct. And we'll equate the two when you can show me how i can
'burn' more copies of an item in or out of game while retaining access
to the original.

Agreed. But if i make an agreement with someone through my website to
sell 100K plat in game for $65, how is this on their servers? I
needent even have the Everquest game on my web server, nor have it
logged in to complete the transaction. Are you claiming that Sony
Online Entertainment has the right to oversee private agreements
taking place off their servers?

Flipping back to your baseball analogy for a moment, would you agree
that you could sell someone Amway from your home, go to the ballpark,
and actually hand them the agreed upon paperwork once you get there?
Its the selling and shilling onsite that is illegal, not the transfer
once you get there. Now, taking it one step farther.. if you are in
PoK /ooc'ing that you'll sell 100K for cheap prices PST.. then yes you
are selling stuff on their servers, and they most certainly can shut
you down, but offserver no.

>They have every right to restrict access to and activities allowed on

Yup.. and they choose not to restrict access to the unlimited trading
of non-no drop items in game. They do choose to restrict the ability
of people to trade US cash for money on their servers, and there is no
facility in game to currently do that. They cannot restrict, nor do
they have access to, transactions occuring off of their servers of
which the only outcome is a legitimate transfer in game under the
unlimited trading access that the game provides.

I guess this is where we agree to disagree. The sale for me was
allready made offserver. The person was courted and sold on someone
elses server before ever logging in, the only thing taking place when
they login is a completion of that sale by transferring items. The
paperwork, the agreement, and everything that matters took place
offserver.

So really.. i can't hand the final paperwork for an Amway sale to
another person at the ballpark, when it was purchased at my home? I
would argue i have the right to hand anything I want to anybody at the
ballpark, I just don't have the inherent right to market myself in
attempt to sell it while at the ballpark. Likewise, I can hand
anything I want to anybody in game once online, because those are the
facilities that the server provides.
