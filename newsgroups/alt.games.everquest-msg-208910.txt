What I read: The discussion came from another poster's idea for
merchants to sell platinum bars as an alternative way to transfer plat
between characters using the shared item slots rather than having to
make a shared coin slot, the bars being in denominations of 1pp, 10pp,
100pp, and 1000pp. I'd commented that the sellback rate of these
wouldn't be constant between characters because of differences created
by charisma and faction.

James' response, as I read it, was saying that he thought there was a
hard-set range of prices vendors will buy items for, and that the
sellback rate could be made constant by setting the min and max in
this range to the same number. My theory on how prices merchants pay
for items was based on a constant number for that item modified by x%
based on charisma and faction.
