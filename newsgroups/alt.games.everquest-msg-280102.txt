I like beastlord & druid, both can solo fine when not grouped. Both are 
pretty fun classes, and they both use leather so you can hunt the same mobs 
for drops.
You have a decent tank and travel once you get there, druid can SOW earlier 
so you have that going for you. Druid buffs are great for the BL as and pet 
as well with DS etc.
