As a cleric you always have a tank handy for playing as a pet, don't you?


On a different note: Pets like these (mages have a similar spell around
level 55 or such) are meant to be used on high magic-resistant mobs. Your
dam spells would be useless and having a low-hp, high-dam pet would be nice
to get some damage in anyway.

It does seem the cleric version is really crappy because of the high mana
cost, but a cleric isn't supposed to dish out lots of mana-efficient damage.
