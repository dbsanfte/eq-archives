Personal experience here. I 2 boxed a cleric and mage. I just setup simple 
cast keys to cast and sit down on the cleric.
1 target mage, heal, sit
2 target mage pet, heal, sit
3 assist mage, root, sit
4 assist pet, root, sit
5 assist mage, nuke, sit
6. target mage, stand, follow
etc.

If I played in a group I would just have a set that targetted the different 
people for heals. Now to be really honest I used MacroQuest to run the party 
cleric, so it would pick the correct heal based on damage taken and class or 
the target, but I did not need it when running just 2 box solo.

I also 2 boxed a druid & beastmaster this was the easiest since the druid 
just thorned, healed the bst, and snared the bst target, and dot'ed made for 
a short list of keys.
