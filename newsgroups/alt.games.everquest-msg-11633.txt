	Heh.  Sounds like me with my very first character ever.  The
first character I ever created was a human rogue based in Qeynos.  I
spent an hour wandering around Qeynos trying to find Crow's Tavern
(which is where the Qeynos Rogue's Guild is located), then spent
another 20 minutes trying to find the Rogue's Guild itself.  I finally
managed to find the secret passageway in Crows, and thought to myself
"Wow, this is cool!  It's also EXTREMELY dark!"  Then I took a couple
more steps, fell through a trapped floor, and died.  Then I respawned,
said "fuck *this* noise," deleted my human rogue, and started a
Barbarian Rogue instead.
