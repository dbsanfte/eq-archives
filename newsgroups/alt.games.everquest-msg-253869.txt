Reread the sections under learning more and a  basic outline. Most of your
issues are addresed. It does have a hidden gotcha and that is it taxes money
that has not been taxed in a long time. Presently we only tax income and we
only tax inheritance on those to stupid or foolish to do proper estate
plannning using wills and trusts. So for instance the children of allstar
athletes almost always pay a 50% death tax but a kennedy or a rockefeller
pays no death taxes.

Since you are taxing consumption all old wealth that is used to consume
things gets taxed where it did not before. Nothing gets taxed if it is not
final consumption so your buisness would not pay tax on non consumables say
like concrete , steel, or computer parts but the end car, house, or computer
would be.
