  I'm not really familiar with Misty Thicket (not as far as hunting goes)
but if you are dying in the more difficult area of that zone, consider
travelling to the East Commons and getting bound in Freeport.  Also, I think
there might be some decent hunting for you in Kithicor, at least during the
day (during the night the zone gets REALLY nasty)... it's hard for me to
say, though... I've never played a halfling character so I'm unfamiliar with
the the halfling newbie zones.  Maybe you can try to find a partner to team
up with to take on the mobs which are giving you difficulty in Misty
Thicket?

  Good luck, I hope somebody gives you better advice than I. :)
