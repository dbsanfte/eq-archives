 From what I heard, the specials that are on the 2-disc version wont be
on the 4-disc version, so I'm not sure how redundant they will be.
However, I haven't looked at the features list for the 4-disc version
yet so I can't say for certain. Not to mention that it's two different
versions of the movie. The 4-disc is 30 minutes longer and wont include
the theatrical version that the 2-disc has.
