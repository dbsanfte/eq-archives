>>>What is the process for setting up a hot button so you can point at x
monster and hit a hot key and it will say "Incoming, a <monster's name> <<<

I'll assume you know how to set up a hotkey, so the command you're looking
for is %t

So, you would make a hot key that looks like this:

Incoming, a <%t>

And it would look like this:

Incoming, a <an orc centurion>

You could also leave off the marks ... incoming, a %t

Incoming, a an orc centurion

But most pullers I know leave the marks on to better identify which mob is
running towards the group.
