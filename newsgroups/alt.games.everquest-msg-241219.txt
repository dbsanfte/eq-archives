    Um, that would probably be me.  And I've seen that you're already gotten the
answer.  I would just like to point out that the one character per account rule
is the thing most responsible for the server's culture.  It is the reason that
reputations matter as much as they do, and why you are much less likely to run
across a genuine griefer.  We have jerks that show up from time to time of
course, but they are generally driven from the server before they do too much
harm.

   Alot of people hate the one character rule, but most of us love it.
