Quite true, as I found out last night. I hit level 5 and took the 20pp I 
had managed to scrape together to the Bazaar and picked up an AC9 chain 
coat with some minor stats (including STR and HP, woot!) and a 5/22 magic 
1hs weapon. I don't remember the names of the items, but they were a much 
needed upgrade. I was also able to replace the cloth items in a few other 
slots by whipping up some tattered/patchwork pieces.

With my newfound AC and DPS, I can stand against whites and the occasional 
yellow. So far, so good. :)
