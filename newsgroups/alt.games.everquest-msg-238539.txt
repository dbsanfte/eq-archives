Thats actually a fairly bad death penalty. Effectively that removes
you from "playing", or rather killing things, for 25 minutes.  As you
say you don't often rack them up though.

I really like the way its done in Anarchy Online. In that game you die
and pop back up at the last insurance booth you saved at. You keep all
xp at the point you saved, or lose it if you did not save. However,
you can't lose anymore than the last level so you can't delevel (which
is nice, compared to Everquest or Final fantasy XI.) All of your stuff
is still equipped, which is good because you are always overequipping
to some extent in AO (so it would be a chore to put it back on
otherwise.) Your items which were in inventory are in a reclaim booth
near the insurance booth, you wait a few seconds until you can remove
them again. 

You then have death affects which last a bit, but no where near 25
minutes. essentially they'd be gone long before you got back into the
action again, while you still can run and such to get back. The death
affects are stat and skill reductions across the board which lessen
until they finally go away. 

The experience loss is even lessened more now. Recently they changed
it so that the lost xp is in a debt pool. So rather than 35,000 xp
just poofing, its in a pool. On your next kill you'll see you got
3,000 xp and 250 xp was deducted from your 35,000 xp debt. So now, in
a sense, you can get back to the point you were at before simply from
getting more xp in the regular way. At level 62 (AO goes to like level
220... ) its never taken me that long to get back a fairly large debt.

I like the AO system the most of mmorpgs, since after 35,000 xp or
whatever you can say "I'm going to save now" and click on an insurance
booth somewhere. So dealing with XP loss is left up to the individual
player and is easily taken care of while soloing or what not. There is
not "resurrect" for xp or anything in AO, you always pop up at the
insurance booth. So its not as convenient as resurrecting for large
scale guild raiding or something in EQ, which is really more of a
convenient tactic, but you don't really do that in AO for the most
part anyway.
