I'm kinda fuzzy on the evolution but I *think* when the augs first
came out, they were totally destroyed if removed. Somewhere along the
line, they made it so, with the use of certain distillers, you can
remove the aug without destroying it, thus, being able to use it again.
Of course, the better the aug, the more expensive the distiller is
to safely remove it.
