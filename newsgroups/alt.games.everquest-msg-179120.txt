Hi, During the last patch, I had lost a belt.. girdle of the flayed iksar.
I'm wondering if anyone knows the rules on what the GM's take to get these
things back to you.

I petitioned the moment I noticed it was missing, and almost immediatly I
got a tell from a guide telling me that it was a known bug that lots of
people have reported this, so I asked if I would get it back. He said yes
just didn't know how long it would take.  Well it has been about a week and
a half now.  So I sent in another petition about it.. and no response.

Am I gonna get my belt back? Or am I shit out of luck? Just wondering if I
need to go searching for another belt=/ /grrrr
Also, should I have put in a bug report?

Im on Bristlebane.. anyone else have this problem?

TIA
