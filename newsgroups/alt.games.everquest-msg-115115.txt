Two suggestions here, one, try a public channel, like auction, offering to
pay for whatever.  The other, at least on EMarr, for porting around there is
the taxi:taxi channel.  If someone is in that channel, they are either
looking for a ride, or willing to give rides for a fee.  I use it whenever I
want a ride now, join the channel, offer xx plat for a port from here to
there, generally within a couple minutes, someone is porting me.
