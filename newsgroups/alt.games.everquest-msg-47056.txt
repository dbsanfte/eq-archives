Bullshit.
Go and find all the STA gear you can, unless you grab just about every
top end drop in ToV North, you're not breaking 255 STA.

Even 205 STA (which with shaman STA buff would cap it at 255) is hard
for many level 60 warriors to achieve.  Mith boots, Reaper's Ring,
Katana of Pain...these aren't exactly ground spawns you know.

BTW, check the spell Avatar (the same spell that procs from primal
weapons).  It adds 100 to STR, DEX, AGI and ATK.  Notice something
missing from that list of melee stats?
