Aye. The price-leaders on pricewatch tend to grab your eye with the
price then your nutsack with the shipping......

Crucial is still offering free 2nd day FedEx shipping - I know 'cause
I just ordered another stick of 256 pc133 from 'em. :)

If you never run your RAM over spec then just about anything that fits
your machine's requirements should work (pc66, 100, 133, etc). I'm
buying Crucial again because I'm running the stick in my machine at
144mhz front side bus speed (at CAS 2) and being the same part #, I'm
hoping the new stick will run at least close to that.
