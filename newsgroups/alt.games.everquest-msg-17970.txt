My at the time lvl 1 wizard sitting at the north gate in qeynos was
asked for a sow, twice by the same person, /who or /whot seems
to be something alien to them, i have printed lists of all spells that
the different casters have so it is easy to see if they can sow or
not, not that i will ask anyway, the lists are more for my own
reference, and i use /who or /whot a lot, but maybe that is just me
lol
