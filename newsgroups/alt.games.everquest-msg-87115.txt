Your guildmate hands in the AC Ring...
You OR your guildmate hand in the Shadow Rapier (doesn't matter which)
then YOU hand in the cash... and get a shiny new pair of Jboots

Multi-questing is where stuff is handed into the NPC by different people
(usually because 1 or more parts are NO DROP)... the last person to hand in
a component is the one who has 'completed' the quest and gets the reward
(again, usually NO DROP)

One of these days I'm gonna drop some cash and a rapier on Hasten (or
whoever the Jboots guy is) just to hear the /shouts when the AC ring
'completes' the multi-quest ;o)
