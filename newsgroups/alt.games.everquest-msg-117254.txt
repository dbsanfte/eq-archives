Dingdingdingding! A multi-billion corporation, which competes with
AOL/Time-Warner, is being sued because a manic-depressive guy killed
himself. Gee, I wonder if *that's* the reason the article mentions
it? Always nice to report on frivolous lawsuits when they're bad PR
for your competition, isn't it?

As for the suicide itself, it was discussed heavily here when the
lawsuit was first reported, and IIRC most agreed with your assessment.
Sure, it was a tragedy, but the guy woulda offed himself whether he'd
played EQ, Go Fish, or pocket pool.

Also, kudos to Jim Monk for making my day with his mime joke in another
followup to your post.
