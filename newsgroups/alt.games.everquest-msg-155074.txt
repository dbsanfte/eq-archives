LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL !!!!!!!!!!
If you weren't such a newbie, and knew what AE RAIN spells were, then you
would know why they aren't used for quadding, and also that they OUTDAMAGE
AE Pillars. Yez Lance, if u ask your nursery teacher thats rilly ubah, and
420 more in damage in comparisson!

Tip of the day: We are not discussing soloing techniques, we are purely
analyzing "offensive spells" between classes. If you read the post, instead
of trolling, you would understand this.

Please, try to limit yourself to talking about things you know. I could
teach you a second time, but i think you got your ass spanked enough this
time.
