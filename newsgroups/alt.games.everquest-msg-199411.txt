Skill level has nothing to do with duration on invis - it is simply
the nature of the spell.

It's a magic base dot - and don't bother with it.  It has the same
mana/damage ratio as the 49 bolt spell, and generates at least as
much aggro.

First - my credentials - I'm a 61 magician.

I understand COMPLETELY about the level 40 blues.  For some reason
people don't know just how much DPS a mage does (at least at those
levels) and need to group with you to be taught.  I'd keep plugging
away at leveling - OT, EW, DL all provide stuff you can hunt.

When you go looking for a group - don't stay at the zone in OOC'ing
it - go around to common camp grounds and ask the groups in person
if they are full or if the could use another person.

Keep this in mind - I was in a PoV group yesterday with a 61 (dinged
62 during the play session) warrior, 61 'chanter, me (61 mage), 65
ranger, 65 druid, 65 cleric (my RL buddy, his in-game wife and our
bot cleric).  On Crystalline Golems (15-20k hp) I was doing around
8k damage (3 SoFB, 3 BWS r-click nukes or 4k and over 60 seconds
of 61 air pet damage which has been parsed at 60-70DPS).  At 61 I
was providing 40% of the damage on each of these guys and maintaining
it indefinitely (KEI + PoT9 + Horse).  The ranger in this has 38AA,
Endless Quiver and Archery Master 2 among them. At 62 this is going up
(62 water pet and BOV will significantly upgrade pet DPS).  With
AA's this goes even higher.  

Also yesterday we left our spot to run and kill Sev (the dragon
in EJ) for our 61 warrior.  We had bad luck on healer fears early,
and our tanks and rangers dropped - but I was able to hold on
quite some time by chaining air pets in - until I missed my 
timing and did /pet get lost just AFTER the spell completed -
and Sev ate me.  Impressed the living daylights out of the folks
there who didn't know me personally.  (I took a few months off
of playing the mage because the flagging fiasco burned me out,
in the interim I let my buddy use my mage to CoH raids into WToV.
It's always kind of funny to get tells "This is the real Mairelon,
isn't it"  "Yep, how'd you know?"  "You do things he doesn't")
The second time we executed better and killed the overgrown 
lizard - and our warrior got his green scale :)  Not bad for 12
folks ranging 61 to 65.

Mages are about serious offense.  Not the best sustained DPS in
the game (Rogues, BL's perhaps) nor the best burst DPS (we are
aggro limited on our nukes, wizards are less so with concussion)
but we are top tier in both - and the combination is amazing to
watch at times.  

The people who invite me to group now are the folks who have seen
the amazing DPS of a mage firsthand many times.  At 54, my water
pet alone was doing as much damage as a non-epic/no spell haste
(so only 21% haste from SCHW) ranger.  With spell haste the ranger
finally started outdamaging the pet - but not pet+me+my DS.

All I can say is - hang in there.  Your mage is in a tough spot
as far as nukes go right now.  44 is far better - and wait until
you get to 49 (research the 49 fire pet SOONEST - it eats XP
mobs for lunch)
