Get a sow from a barbarian shaman friend.  Tell friend to stand still.  Go
back from friend to get a running start and then hual but so that you are
running right at him.

Got SF up for my bard that way and it is quite useful, especially for a bard
with Selo's...

A bard is running through DC to get to Unrest.  She is flying with selo's
and not really paying attention.  Next thing she knows she see... Loading,
please wait.  Safe fall is great.
