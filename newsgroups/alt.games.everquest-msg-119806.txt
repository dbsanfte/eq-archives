That's an issue I'm wrestling with right now. I'm very close to
completing the third Coldain Prayer Shawl quest for my wizzie. I really
want that one, not so much for the shawl itself, but for the range slot
seal that gives plus 3 INT. With the addition of those two items,
though, my unbuffed INT is going to be 211.  I have a number of items
that have INT only and no +Mana, so I have to start looking around for
any big "bang for the buck" +Mana items that I could swap out with some
of the INT only ones.

Always open for suggestions.
