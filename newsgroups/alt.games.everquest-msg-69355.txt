Does anyone know where I can get a driver for a Voodoo2 card that supports
the Directx 8.x needed to run Everquest?  Ever since the new requirements, I
have been unable to play the game.  I have a Gateway GP6-400 system with a
Voodoo2 3D Video card.  I have upgrade to the maximum memory that this
system is capable of running (384MB).  When I try to run the game, I get the
message that no 3D card can be found.  Everquest has been less that
responsive to any inquiries about drivers.  Their link fo Voodoo2 is a "page
not found".  Need help !
