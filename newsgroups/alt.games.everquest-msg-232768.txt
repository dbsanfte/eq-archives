This is my most heavily kill-filed group and the only group that I have 
people on kill-files that expire.  I don't know what it is about this game 
and/or newsgroup but no where else have I run into posters that can go for 
days giving reasonable feed back and then act like their medication just 
wore off.  

EQcasters at http://eq.crgaming.com/ has some very nice basic information 
on it for all of the classes
