Perhaps he was trying to say that it had to be put into a
general inventory slot long enough to "cast" it (just like
you can't drink booze from a backpack, you have to place it
in a general inventory slot, *then* right-click it).

Or maybe he didn't snap to the fact that although you have
to cast it from a general inventory slot, nothing prevents
you from stuffing it into a backpack (or a tailoring kit,
if it happens to be an "extra large" item which won't fit
in a backpack) while you're just carrying it around.

I too really really hope it doesn't need to be *kept* in
a general inventory slot, because I'm a packrat who always
has most of my eight containers full of junk.  I'd hate to
have to jettison one of my containers.
