What would be funny would be if this had happened:

1. Some people put it up for 110+, for their guilds.

2. Various people see that and don't realize that it is just for show.

3. You put it up for 10.

4. The people from #2 see it, and snap it up, figuring to buy you out, and
then sell it for 100, figuring that the regular price is 110+.
