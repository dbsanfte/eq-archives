My wife and I have been playing a necro(her) + druid(me) pair for
quite some time. If you're willing to stay out of dungeons for the
most part, this duo simply rocks. For outdoors hunting and travel, 
they have it all: pet, snare, fear, SoW, teleports, tracking, invis 
vs live or undead, DDs to exploit any resistance weakness as well
as specialty DD vs undead and summoned, and a repertoire of DoT 
lines which all stack.

We're still trying to come up with the perfect pair for dungeoneering,
if such a thing exists. Seems like to do dungeons effectively, you
need a skill set that is greater than any two-character group can
provide.
