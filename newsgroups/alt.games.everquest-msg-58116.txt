I kindof agree.. but they can save an entire raid.  If you get wiped out to
(for example) the king in Chardok, the necro can FD and quit out, and when
everybody is dead (more often then not in a place so cramped as that the
clerics don't get a chance to camp out) they can rez a cleric back in.
Otherwise, a wipeout at king is simply too far to try and reover the raid by
re-breaking back in (for most people anyway) and your gonna be summoning
every corpse to the zoneline.
