They should also give druids a port to nexus somehow, even just a self port,
I still sell stuff in EC because I can port down to WC and run over in under
2 minutes, as opposed to porting to DL, running to wiz spires and waiting up
to 15 minutes for them to fire off.

And don't even suggest that I bind myself in the bazaar/nexus/shadowhaven, I
bind myself where it's convenient for me after I die, or somewhere I'm
waiting on a camp so I can gate back after the other person is done.
