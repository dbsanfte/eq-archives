Can you change the color of the /g text then?
I use:

/g %t has been snared
/g %t has been feared
/g %t incoming

etc etc..
It would be very handy to be able to change the color of these so they can
be quickly read by the group so no one tries to root it whilst its nared and
feared.

Cheers for you help,
