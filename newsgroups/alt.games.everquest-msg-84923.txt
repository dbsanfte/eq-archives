Doh! It was a virus. (
Ran the live update for Norton, did a thorough system scan, and sure
enough it found one. Once that was done, I then went in (following the
other suggestion) and deleted the files it was downloading. (For the
record, they were eqgame.exe and Lpatch.exe). Next time I logged in it
downloaded the files. Immediately exited all the way and logged in
again. No download, and everything looked smooth last night.

Thanks for the tips.
