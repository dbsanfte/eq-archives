MMOG's have to be considered with a different mindset that your typical 
single player game. The question one has to ask themself should be, is 
$12.95US/month too much to pay for unlimited play time and enough content 
to keep it interesting for years?

If a person can't seem to pry themself away from it long enough to eat, 
bathe, take care of their kids or go to work, then that's the fault of 
their own irresponsibility or a personality particularly prone to 
addiction, not the game itself.

It always baffles me how people will criticize or complain about being 
"addicted" to EQ. Never have I heard of anyone who truly wanted to quit but 
couldn't. If it's fun, people will play it. If they find it *really* fun or 
*really* engaging, they'll play it a lot.

I see people watch hours of television every day, but people don't call 
that an addiction. I'm not talking about news or educational programs. I'm 
referring to the endless banality that is sit-coms, reality TV, soap operas 
exploitive talk shows, etc.

It's just like anything else. If it's fun, not harmful to yourself or 
others and can be done responsibly, then by all means do it. Otherwise, 
maybe it's not for you.
