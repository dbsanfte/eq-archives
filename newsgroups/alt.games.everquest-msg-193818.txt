Similar thing happened to me right after the last patch. Was restocking my
Trader and taking the plat (over 3k Plat) off her. I hit the trade button
and went link dead. When I came back the items had transfered but no plat on
either character. Logged off a bit miffed. Next day I went back to test with
small amounts of plat. First time I clicked on the plat space, the missing
plat appeared on my curser. No petition/GM involved. WOOT!!!

I've had no problems since, but I guess there are still a few bugs running
around in the Bazaar.
