Nothing at all. 

However many species appear in the fossile record fully formed and stay 
that way for millions upon millions of years.

Even if you wanted to argue against the 'punctuated' you can't argue 
against the 'equilibrium'. And the equilibrium more or less forces the 
'punctuated' otherwise evolution would never happen fast enough.

Ok.
