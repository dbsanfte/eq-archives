OMG! I think I am going to cry. Finally a use for Quivers. Have aliens replaced
the Verant staff? J/K =)

Very cool. Wizards need even more though. =)
I agree that not being able to Translocate yourself seems kind of silly.
Hell Clerics can Rez themselves!

Does this mean that they will cost less than a thousand plat from players now? =)

I never destroyed anything accidentally but it was annoying, especially since the
confirmation box can overlays your inventory screen in full screen mode.

OMFG! Ok you can officially call me a VAK now.

What the hell am I going to bitch about now? =)

To get to Ally to the Dragons in Skyshrine is going to take a long long time.

I wonder if this expands the upper range or just displays it?
