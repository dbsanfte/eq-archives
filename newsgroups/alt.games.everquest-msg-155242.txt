Its a tactic of raids that needs to be learnt as much as cheal rotations
are, once both are mastered then raids are down to execution, dps + mana
versus mobhp+regen etc

Try and get your melees (and nuking/debuffing casters) trained better in
agro management.. e.g -

Nobody but the MA engages the mob at the beginning of the fight
Nobdy else attacks or nukes the mob until the MA says so (give him time to
build sufficient agro)
Don't all out nuke at 100% (generally results in a pissed off mob in the
middle of all your casters)
Make sure *everybody* is standing when the mob is inc
Don't cast huge agro buffs too early, yes, your tash IS going to massively
out-agro the warrior within 1 second of engaging
Don't sit right after casting a heal/nuke/debuff (if possible, stand all
fight, else give sufficient time for agro to reduce)
Maximum distance - melees should be at maximum distance from the mob when
fighting (i.e 1 more step backwards and you get the "target too far away"
message)
Use your agro reducing spells : rogues should always be evading, monks/sk's
should periodically FDing, rangers should jolt often, wizards should concuss
Use agro spells on your MA - chanters and SK's now have +hate spells they
can cast on the MA
Use agro-reducing spells on your casters/clerics - enchanters can cast
spells on people which lowers their agro
If your not the MA you DONT taunt
Procing weapons are a big no-no if the proc is likely to pull agro from the
MA (snare, tash, slow etc)
If DPS and mana for the fight is fine, and its just agro management thats
wiping you, all warriors except the MA should not be kicking or bashing
Keep everybody at a decent HP level - when mobs AE, riposte etc people take
damage even though they don't have agro - keep them topped up on life or
eventually they will low-HP agro
Get a decent weapon on your MA, something that procs is even better (e.g
SoD, Willsapper, epic blade, BoC - substitute weapons equivalent to your
level and availability)
If the MA dies, everybody turns attack off except the next MA.  Again give
him sufficient time to build agro, and then wait for his call again before
returning to battle.

Some mobs are best killed by pinning them into a wall, this can prevent
ping-ponging it

Keeping agro on 1 person is the first step in stepping up to newer and
tougher mobs, once you have that down then its just down to execution
