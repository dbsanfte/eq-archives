I don't play shims (female characters as a guy period) but 1 day I had to
make a character to do a transfer for a friend, he was already in a hurry
and pretty impatient so I just clicked "human", "get a name", put all my
training into whatever the mouse was over and clicked "finish".. it was a
throwaway char Id never use so it really made no difference at all

Anyway it was created a female human paladin - after getting the item in EC
tunnel from my friend, and ready to log, somebody /hugged me (random person
about level 10) and pestered me to group with him, he was going to "take
care of me"

I /sighed at him, and some other random_guy made a /rude guesture at the
first guy, said bla bla dont hassle this here fine lady.. i will duel you if
you do that again, bla bla, and then he put a whole suit of armour into my
trade window

I said all of 2 emotes, and it confirmed what I already know about female
chars in the game

Btw a year later, it still has zero exp in level 1   <-- really doesnt play
shims
