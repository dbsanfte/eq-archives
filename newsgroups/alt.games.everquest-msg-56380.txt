   The WC route would have taken me through lions and near another entire 
orc camp. The Nektulos route would have run me past bears and the 
occasional lion. The run to the tunnel took me towards guards and 
lower-level critters. 
   All that aside, the orcs weren't following me--they were stomping on 
the World's Stupidest Druid. I was just trying to get the hell out of 
Dodge and back onto safe ground before they finished picking their teeth 
with his femurs. Believe me, I know what I'm doing.
