Heh-heh.  This is the exact computer I was looking at when I was
writing the original post.  :)  I want to thank everyone who took the
time to reply.  Except for the RAM stuff (wanted to know if there was
any real reason to get RAMBUS stuff), you've generally confirmed my
initial thoughts, so I'm ready to start moving on this.
I hope to get some stuff on order in the next several days, and have
it up and running by the end of next week.  I'll post more about it
after I get it all sorted out.
Thank again all.
