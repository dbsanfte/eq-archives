Apparently not.

My cable provider has been experiencing an attack for several weeks
now. They're kind of mum about the source of the attack (CodeRed,
random zombies, whatever), but the effects are hard to mistake...

My receive light flashes *constantly*.
My download speed has been reduced to perhaps 1/4 the normal.
Doing remote SQL access is slowed to the point of being awful.

I'm not getting any packet loss or anything like that, but I am
starting to lose my sense of humor, especially in light of their lax
reactions to the problem.

Pretty safe.

And for the ultra-paranoid, you can run Zone Alarm in conjunction with
your hardware firewall. This is really useful for seeing what *your*
system is trying to do online, and can be a big help in stopping any
trojans you may already have from doing you any damage.


If you want to see how your system looks to a potential outside
attacker, go to this web page http://grc.com/default.htm

Steve Gibson isn't much of a web designer (as you'll see), but he's
got some very useful tools there that will check your system.
Specifically, try the Shields Up and Probe My Ports items. You don't
need to download or install any software to use this - his site picks
up your IP address, and tries to access it in a variety of ways, and
reports the results.
