That all depends on the exact wording of your trade. Normally, people want to buy
a 10 dose potion (you can not buy a 'stack' of SoW potions). Since you announced 'I
got three' and ge  gave you 300 pp, I assume he was under the impression that
you sell three 10-dose potions, as the standard price for a 10doser is 100 pp 
wherever I went (and my shammy sells for that price). Anyway .. if you really
thought 3 potions and he thought 3 10dosers, then it's a misunderstanding you two
coul dhave worked out politely :)
