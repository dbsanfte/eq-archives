  Like I said, the Dreadlands are the "sheep" option.  It's the easiest
pickup group hunting area in this level range, and so it attracts those who
are looking the path of least resistence.

  I'd strongly suggest finding another hunting area if you can manage it.

  However, there are several things at this level that you can hunt in this
zone.  Yeti's in the caves, the skeletons in the Combine ruins and wandering
cockatrices, drolvargs, giants, drachnids and brutes on the north wall of
Karnor's castle.

  As for tips... it's a pretty basic outdoor zone, there isn't a lot of
zone-specific advice to give.  There's a dragon (Gorenaire) who wanders
about, but he shouldn't attack you unless you're in wolf form or something.
Like I said before, it's a basic, easy zone for this level range, so you
shouldn't need any special advice.
