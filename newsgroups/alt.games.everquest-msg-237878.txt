I just decided to dip back into EverQuest after a hiatus of a few 
months, and I'm having trouble restarting due to some extremely severe 
performance issues which seem to be lag related. I've trawled through 
Google's multitude of links to how to optimise performance, and none of 
the suggestions (and I've used them all...at one point I had nothing 
more advanced than the base-most settings on everything).

I have a 128MB GeForce 4 card, 2.5GHz processor, 512MB ram and masses of 
hard drive space, system wise.

So to the problem...I zoned in to find movement, in both my character 
and the mouse, to be extremely sluggish. The mouse was almost 
uncontrollable, while the character chugged along at a slow crawl. I got 
the net connection info stats up and it said I had a ping of 220 - 250. 
Now I play quite a few other online games, and the pings I get on those 
are all down in the 20 - 50 range. So as well as the masses of tweaks to 
the settings I made, bringing everything slowly down until nothing 
advanced was selected, I checked my characters on the UK server as 
well...still 220 - 250 ping.

So I'm at a loss, how do I improve this? That said, my mouse was always 
slightly sluggish (in all games and all applications my mouse moves 
instantaneously, in EverQuest it's always moved a little like it's 
dragging a lead weight with it) but never to the extent it is now.

Any suggestions would be helpful, I'd love to actually be able to play 
the game properly, because the way it currently is, it's almost 
completely unplayable :-(
