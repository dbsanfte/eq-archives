I hadn't seen that problem, the necro pet that went for me in the eye of zomm
incedent backed off once I convinced the owner that I was really being eaten
alive by it (necro pet should -not- be same level as necro whats up with that!)
And of course in the LD incedent, the owner was LD so he wasn't around to try
backing it off.

Either way, this is all ugliness and I hope its been patched out of existance
as they seem to indicate.
