Umm it has been my experience on my server that the Shroud of Nature is camped
24/7 in the Temple of Droga. Najena usually has some farmers in it. Dalnir always
has someone farming on my server. SolA Is farmed 24/7 on my server, especially
the for the Impskin gloves, charred guardian shield, and the Molten cloak.
You must be on some weird server because Frontier Mountains on my server usually
has 30-40 people in it during prime time, mostly at the giant fort.

Don't forget the number one reason people don't hunt some dungeons. Trian Death.
Runnyeye, kerra Isle and Infected Paw(old splitpaw lair) were all redone but the
main problem with these dungeons was never fixed. They are train spawning grounds.
Changing the Mob names and making different loot spawn doesn't change that.

Mobs are too close together and the dungoens overlap levels and have too many
rooms too close together. Mobs aggroing and casting thru the walls make these
dungeons unplayable by the appropriate levels unless you invade them with a large
raiding party/guild.
