Mine was in the group i was playing with we had a dwarven barbarian with us
and we were sailing north in Faerun and along the shore was a goblin camp
and they shouted something at the boat in Goblin.  Well the barbarian
decided they were talking bad about him so he jumped in the water and swam
over and killed the 2 goblins.  He looked at us on the boat as we were
astounded he did such a thing.  He then shouted "Anyone else got a language
problem!"  From that point on we never spoke outside of common when he was
around.
