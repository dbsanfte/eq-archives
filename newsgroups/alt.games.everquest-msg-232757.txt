   Another helpful thing you might want to do is go to google, hit groups, then
type everquest plus whatever keywords you think might pertain to whatever it is
you are asking.  Sort by date so that you get fewer answers from the the '70's. 
Or you can just look up a particular user, like say Darktyger if you really want
to see how he usually responds.  He's rabid, of course, but he sometimes does
post useful stuff.
