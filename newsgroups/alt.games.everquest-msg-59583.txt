Ah thanks handy and drovar.

Question in looking at this: I have suse 7.2 and am really use to suse
and like it (especially auto updating and such with sax2 and control
thingie) Running this sims from transmeta on there would be fun but it
seems to only come on this mandrake linux? Can you run just the sims
on another linux or would you have to use mandrake?

Oh there answer seems to be no, read more of the site, but they have a
poll for a non mandrake general linux seperate version. Ah, it also
explains the problems with the sims regular windows version under
linux.

AAHHA everquest has popularity rating of 105. I don't like these guys
really though because they charge a subscription fee of 5 bucks just
to download their wine... doesn't really make it seem very open. EQ is
in the top 10 to get under linux. There is one thing that I see as a
major hurdle to it being under linux though:

Verant does not want it to be able to run under linux because the user
would have too much control and verant is hacker paranoid. Doubtless
they could make it so it never would work under linux also.
