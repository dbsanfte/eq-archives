10pp being a silly price?  What about desperate buyer? I auctioned 3 stacks
of bone chips once and the buyer (without first asking what I wanted) put
30pp in the trade window. I accepted. Also at the same time I'd checked
http://www.everlore.com/items and people claim as much as 70pp for 60 stacks
bone chips.  Then someone else claims to have sold them for as much as 5
stacks for 100pp.
(http://www.everlore.com/items/items.asp?mode=show&IID=1660)
    I've personally often without asking for prices sold them for as much as
5-10pp though also often if the buyer asks how much I'll offer 3pp or maybe
4 for 10pp. But if someone wants to pay 10pp for a stack, I'll let them (in
East Commons).
