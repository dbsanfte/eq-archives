Both "couldn't" and "could not" are valid usage, well at least here in
Australia anyway. They do put a slightly different inflection on what is
said though. For example;

    "I could not care less" - makes the statement sound more deliberate and
calculated. I get a mental picture of someone looking you in the eye as they
speak from this usage.

    "I couldn't care less" - is a bit more casual and blaise. From this
usage I get the mental picture of someone just giving the brush off
treatment.


But then again - I am definately no expert.

Cheers
