You are the same person that wants a clarity or a rez. If I am busy you can
bet that I am very unlikely to rez you if you are anon or roleplay. ( I also
charge more if you are in roleplay or anon mode). The ONLY time I use
roleplay is when I am in a guild event or really good group that I know I
will not leave. No sense in someone wasting their time asking me.
I have a druid also and just put up with the request for SoW. Doesn't use
much mana or time.

Anyone

The post titled "SOW? Do I look like a Druid", really hit home for me. Now
you guys know how Druids feel. Ever wonder why so many use Anon or Roleplay?
Particularly in Freeport and the Commons areas. Greater Faydark is just as
bad.

I am a Wood Elf Druid and I can SOW, and I have made the mistake of doing it
in a crowded areas. I can't do anything else after that. Tunare help me if I
Bind someone in open view of others. It's like making a bad pull. People
come out of the woodwork mobbing you. Begging for everything from buffs to
money.

One thing that I will do is SOW, Buff and Bind someone that recognizes me
for what I am. Especially if they use /tell. I respect that they at least
know enough to recognize a Druid by sight. I suppose that's why I like the
higher level areas now days. Solitude and no oppressive hordes.

Now I don't mind helping people out, but where do you draw the line?
