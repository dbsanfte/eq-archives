Not just burning through AA's in the Plane of Fire, either, though
there has been some of that, too. There's been time spent in
Tirrannun's Delve and the Ascent doing DoN progression tasks,
and Tipt runs for Kod'Taz access. But most of all Adas is burning
through flags: HoHb, Mith Marr, Arlyxir, Jiva, TZ. And it's mainly
thanks to her new guild, Saviours.
  This is the server merge, finally coming through to make hard-
charging high-end raiding a viable play style for me. It was never
an option back on TP, but Bertox had Saviours, a guild that raids
on MY time, 9am Eastern. Up until now, I had rarely gotten up
that early, usually playing after work to 3am and sleeping until
10 or 11, which turned out to be the aboslute worst schedule in
terms of finding groups; nobody else played these hours, not
enough to form regular groups. Ditching the late night futility
of searching for groups when prime time raiders were going to
bed and Austrailian guilds were still getting up, I was able to join
an odd-hours early-day guild that has hopes of breaching Time,
and of farming Time-quality loot in various places.
  We farm Sol Ro minis. We took down Rydda'Dar with 32 people;
I wouldn't have thought that was possible, though some of us
do have Time and OOW gear. They got Adas her Warrior trial at
long last (they call it "Save the children"; apparently the villiagers
you have to protect from the evil-race warriors are like children).
We went on to take down Lord Mithaniel Marr himself with
35 people. Not the cleanest fight, either; we were able to pull
off one of his protectors for single kill, but the other had to be
offtanked and killed while holding LMM in place. And one of the
nearby lulled wrulons had been accidentaly aggroed and had to
be killed, so it popped during the fight and slowed us down with
diversion of DPS to kill it. But we did it, in the end.
  There's been some other backflagging here and there, and will
likely be more. Adas now only needs Rizlona for access to Sol Ro's
chamber. Invictvs assured me killing Sol Ro would grant chamber
access. Not so, it turns out; it's a very unforgiving flag.
  I'm sure we could take down VZ and TZ as well. I had done VZ,
and now needed TZ; but fortunately I caught another open raid
for him, so now Adas is ready for the Warlord. Two tries lately
with open raid numbers around 60ish; first time we were sloppy
pulling the triggers and had too many deaths due to repops,
causing our surviving chanter to go OOM keeping the triggers
mezzed while clerics rezzed and rebuffed, and they were still too
low on mana for the fight and couldn't get even one heal off on
our fake-VZ tank. Last night's attempt was much better; the raid
leader had adjusted his strategy, clearing to the north trigger and
having a chanter dedicated to keeping him with us, mezzed, while
we cleared to the south trigger, killed him with no fuss, and then
the mezzed one to start the event. Fake RZ posed no real problem,
and we rezzed and rebuffed quickly for the pit fight; in the pit,
we got RZtW down to 50% when the kiters proved unable to
stay ahead of the adds, and only down to 25% when we wiped
(Adas was able to Abscond when it seemed she was the most
major standing DPS).
  Hopefully we will get him down sometime in the next few weeks;
either with this open raider, or a Svaiours-sponsored alliance or
open raid. For now, we concentrate on more suitable targets of
opportunity. A bard mob in Castle Mistmoore gives out Time-
quality loot; on Saturday we farmed two Bloodied Gypsy Lutes
so we can do her at least twice., along with a bunch of bones for
the halfling at the zone entrance. Kod'Taz and the zones beyond
also beckons, so we've been running Tipt trials; Adas has had bad
luck so far with three failed attempts, but will likely get it done this
week. (Three of the successful runs lately dropped an nice int-caster
bracer that would be an upgrade for Adas, but no int-casters were
on those runs, oddly.) We've explored Ikkins raid 1, capable of
dropping the best shield Adas is ever likely to get. She will, of course,
be one of the last to get one, if she does, but there's no hurry.
She's still a Phase 2 recruit, with membership vote weeks away.
I've invested $170 in plat purchases to upgrade her gear, buying
raidiant crystals in the Bazaar to make DoN gear available. She
will only bid DKP on REALLY good upgrades well down the road.
  If she's accepted as a full member, she has a home among poeple
like herself,  playing at odd hours, and a place among the high-end
raiding life of Everquest. If she ends up on the street...Azeroth had
better watch out. I'll be pissed.
