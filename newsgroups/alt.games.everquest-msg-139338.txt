A recent post by a mage who said he was running
his second mage up in levels made me think.

I ran a cleric to 49, "quit the game" came back,
played around with some other characters, and
ended up running a cleric, this time to 60.

I've found myself considering making a new
cleric and doing it again, from time to time.

I've run many other classes up to 20, a druid
to 34, a bard to 40, a mage to 28... but
still, a cleric... well, think what I could do,
knowing what I know now, with the
twinkage gear I could provide, and with
a different race and different stat choices!

How many others have run same class more
than once, or think about it from time to time?
