PoK and Nexus are near to most places.  In Nexus, there are the
transporters that work every 15 minutes.  Most folks can run from a
town to the places the transporters take you within 15 minutes, so
those cubby holes for the transporters usually are empty.  Drop the
items there and then pick them up.
