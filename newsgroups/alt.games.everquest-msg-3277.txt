My halfling druid Rosewhite is half way through level 19. She spent much of
17th taking down the DE guard in Nektulos near Lavastorm and battling the
occasional stone guardian when someone else was camping the guard.

North Karana has also been quite nice for experience although not as
financially profitable. Go for borer beetles, highland lions and the occasional
(at your level) blue griffawn (that is grifFAWN. Don't make the same stupid
mistake I did and think a grifFENE was safe.) At 19, Rosewhite has moved more
to East Karana to hunt gorge hounds, shadow stalkers and the even-conned crag
spiders; these could easily take her to 22nd. You might also want to hunt
muddite minors in the Gorge of King Xorbb; when they become green you can take
down minotaurs so long as you "snare and flare" and don't get close enough for
them to hit you.

If you are halfling and want to take a break from leveling, do the Acolyte
Anklet (3 AC, 2 AGI, 2 WIS, 3 CHA) and Leatherfoot Raiders Cap (7 AC, 5 STR, 5
AGI, 10 CHA, 5 vs Magic) quests. The anklet is wearable by halfling, gnome and
dwarf clerics and druids and requires three samples of cursed flesh (algae
covered flesh from a zombie sailor in Erud's Crossing, waterlogged flesh
dropped by a greenblood zombie in the Feerott and waterlogged flesh dropped by
a drowned citizen in the West Freeport tunnels). The Cap is wearable only by
halflings and has two parts: get a grizzly bear skin (from the Karanas), a
polar bear skin (from Everfrost), a shark skin (I got mine from East Freeport;
Erudin is also a good place) and an alligator skin (from a bull alligator, a
very difficult spawn in Innothule. Just kill giant water moccasins and swamp
alligators and eventually the bulls will come out) and give them to one of the
Marshals in the Rivervale Citadel to get the Leatherfoot Cap (4 AC and 10 CHA).
Give him back the cap and a dragoon's dirk (bought mine off a player for 30pp;
found another off a dragoon's corpse in Nektulos) to get the Leatherfoot
Raider's Cap. Check out Allakhazam for quest particulars. They are VERY nice
items.
