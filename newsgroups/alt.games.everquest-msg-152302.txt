Maybe not important to you or me, but obviously it is to the original
poster. Since those are the only two areas where the classes overlap,
it makes sense to compare their other skills when deciding between
them. 

Quad kiting may be boring to you and me, but we can't speak for other
players.

If someone wanted to have the "Tinker" skill , and were undecided
about which class to play, they might very well ask such a question. 

Apples and Oranges are both fruit, and both are sweet. If someone had
to choose a piece of fruit, and wanted something sweet, they might ask
about the pros and cons of them as well. Then someone would chime in
with the merits of Bananas, and a flame war would erupt. :)

I'm not trying to argue with you. I am merely pointing out that there
are valid reasons to compare the two classes.
