You've probably already heard it, but for iron oxide, Najena or Twilight Sea
are the best places to farm it, kill ALL types of elementals, only earth
elementals can drop iron oxide, but the rest are PHs, and you can get some
Swirling Mist, Drops of Mercury and Lava Rocks while you're at it also.  And
port into Steamfont and check the ground spawns every once in a while.

Or just pay a gnome vendor 3pp for a stack. <grin>
