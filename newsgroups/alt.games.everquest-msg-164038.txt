The man aint wrong guys.
Insult him, call him names, be as witty as you like but his point is
dead on. Sony will never sell many of us another game after this,  I
came out ahead by sheer luck. That the monk nerf failed in hitting its
stated target has been admitted a failure by soe, so taking a position
that it was justified and calling those who rightly complain whiners
is only proving oneself a simpleton. Fact is that sony just does not
communicate with players and that is the real problem.

A person is supposed to identify with a char, after all it is a role
playing game. Some identify very strongly as on the servers where only
one char is allowed. So anything that affects this char is going to
affect the people playing it. And please drop the "Its only a game"
retort. So are football, baseball, politics, military tactical theory,
and chess,  we all see how seriously people take some of those
"games". 

To put this monk nerf in perspective to other classes, bards for
instance would lose the ability to twist more than 2 songs. Still
functional after a fashion but having to relearn every tactic and
still being only a shadow of what they were. Think of Druids without
sow, Shaman without slow, Chanters without clarity, Clerics without
buffs, or even better cutting ALL caster manna by 25% because KEI
exists in the game. Now be honest if there's anything that can be said
to be unbalancing the game right now its KEI. The move on monks was
brutal and without any justification when compared to this situation. 

Peace
