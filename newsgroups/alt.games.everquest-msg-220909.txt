That's why I made my own.  That and the fact that many customs made the 
interface elements bigger, when I wanted them more compact.  Things like
getting rid of title bars, compressing the group/player/target window into
1 window - with no invite/disband/lfg buttons, making the spell gem window
a 2 column window (the same width as the hotbutton window,) and, the only
downloaded mod, a buff-window with smaller buff icons.  

With my spells, hot-buttons and songs 40pixels wide, and my group, pet
and buffs 124 pixels wide - I can stack the first 3 on the left, the 2nd
3 on the right, chat windows on the bottom and /viewport 40 0 860 600 I
get my little 1 Ghz/GF2/256meg machines to perform moderately well in most
situations.

Interestingly enough, I get the warning about my interface not being 
compatible - it happened when I removed the buttons from the group window.
Fortunately the errors are logged, so after any patch I can check to see if
the errors are actually important (in this case I really don't care that I
don't have those buttons - I never use them; I prefer not taking my hand
from the keyboard so I've type /invite, /disband and /lfg since the were
implemented.)

Also of note, /loadskin has a memory leak.  Iterative XML coding/testing 
causes window switches and skin loading to get slower and slower until EQ
locks up entirely, usually right after I get a warning about my paging file
being too small.
