Then the mage should bring a tracking friend or hire the servers of a Ranger
if they have concerns over tracking class beating them too it. Casting a
bolt from a range where you cannot see whether the mob is engaged is not an
accidental KS - it is an intentional careless act resulting in a deliberate
killsteal if that mob was already engaged.

Epics are a PITA. So are heaps of other things in EQ with large rewards.
None of them are a <legitimate> excuse for assholery.

Personally I wouldn't have got upset over it - I would have just petitioned
and then forgot about it. In the rare event a GM was on, and cared, then I
would just let them deal with it how they saw fit.
