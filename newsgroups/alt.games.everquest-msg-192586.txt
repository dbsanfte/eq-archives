As a follow up to this message, today my pet finally killed the Druid
I have on a seoond account while I was attacking an Ember Hornet in
Burning Woods.  Instead of attacking the hornet like it should have,
my pet started attacking my Druid who was just standing nearby but not
doing anything.  The Druid didn't cast a spell or anything.  I was
wondering where my pet was when I noticed too late that the pet was
attacking the Druid.

Any ideas on how I go about reporting this nasty bug?
