Well, I think I'll just start another warrior that follows a more peaceful
religion that would be accepted by all the good races (elves and dwarves at
least).  I don't want to bother raising/lowering faction at lvls 1-10 in the
game so I think Rallos Zek is out of the question if it is going to get me
KOS.  I actually am leaning towards a half-elf this time also (for the
warrior).  They have slightly better well-rounded stats I believe (since
i'll be focusing on STR jewelery, the -5 difference is nothing and the
addition to base Dex/Agi is nice), and besides, they are half-HUMAN anyway
like a previous poster said. ;)
