By the time you get to that stage, level 24, equipment can make up for any
choices you made in character selection menu. I think you will get to that
stage a lot faster with a few extra points in WIS for those times when you
don't find a group.

Necros have similar options for trading hitpoints for mana. I don't see
anyone telling necros to trade INT for hitpoints.
