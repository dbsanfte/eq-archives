Well, like an idiot, I jumped into the lake in WCommons and promptly died
because of goddamned Dragoon Xytl and his f*cking pet!! Was just trying to
get swimming skill up, didn't know that THAT asshole would sic his pet on me
(and I never even SAW him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)) and kill me. I died
thereafter 3 times. And STILL cannot recover corpse!!!!!!!!!!!! I hate that
sonofabitch.

sigh.

Darklet, now lvl 17 again.
