A while back they fixed npc's so they couldn't cast against you if they
couldn't see you. I still recall being nuked to death in assorted dungeons
by mobs I never saw, who must have aggroed because I was seated...

Then there was a patch a while back where they stopped that, but balanced it
by give the caster's more intelligent spell choices. Now in JPF, I find
darkpaw corrupters and healers are able to nuke/dot me while they stay
inside the tunnel, well out of range of my spells, and I stand waiting out
the tunnel and to the left... for those not familiar with it, there's a hub
of tunnels where they spawn, and most people will pull from that hub to the
outside, to avoid adds.

It seems like the last patch gave the mobs back spells with:
     unlimited range
     no line of sight needed
    through any obstacle .

 Anyone else found this?

It's kind of funny; if I could do that I'd be banned for exploitation, but
what happens to the mob if they do it?
