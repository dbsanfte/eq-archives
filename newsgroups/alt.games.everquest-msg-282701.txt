*** Headlines ***

- Prophecy of Ro Launches!
- The Desert of Ro and the city of Freeport have been revamped
- Alchemy system has received an overhaul
- New Hot Zones


*** Prophecy of Ro Launches! ***

As a demi-god, Mayong Mistmoore -- the greatest vampire ever known --
is threatening Norrath and its gods. Druzzil Ro, the goddess of Magic,
has seen the future and the darkness that lies ahead. Now, the time
has come to heed Druzzil Ro�s calls as she opens the planes of Rage
and Magic and a passage through time to the long lost Elddar elven
city of Takish-Hiz. Draw your swords and prepare your magic to face
the greatest fight of your lives. 

The full story is available in-game in your Storyline window.


*** Prophecy of Ro Features ***

- Spheres of Influence - Spheres of Influence will appear in expansion
zones as visual effects, like soft blue lights, whirling winds, or
spinning axes. Any player or non-player character that enters the area
of the sphere is subject to its effects. In order to see Spheres of
Influence, you must have Player particles enabled in your display
options.

- Auras - Players can create Spheres of Influence called Auras. There
is an Auras window available in the Character section of your EQ menu
which shows your currently active auras and gives you the ability to
remove them with a right-click. Player auras are available through
mission rewards and events much like spells. In order to see Auras,
you must have Player particles enabled in your display options.

- Destructible Objects - Destructible objects, like walls, doors, and
siege engines, are used in many of the new expansion zones. These are
terrain objects that have a health points which can be depleted and,
when the object has reached low enough health, it will crumble and
break. As you damage the objects you will see it break down until it
is completely destroyed. You can identify an object that is
destructible because it will pulse when you put your mouse over it. 

- Zone Traps - Traps in EverQuest are now represented by objects that
can be seen or hidden. As you would expect, traps trigger if you move
into their range and you or your party, and sometimes the entire zone,
can be affected by them. Rogues and bards have the ability to sense
traps, reveal them to those around them, and disarm them. All traps in
the game have been converted to use this new trap system.

- Player Traps - Traps are available to players in the same way as
spells and abilities, through specific quests, mission rewards, and
off spell or discipline vendors. Once a trap has been memorized, it
can be created by using the spell or discipline. The trap will remain
in the area it is summoned until it is triggered, disarmed, removed by
the player who set it using the new Remove Trap skill, or expires.

- Buff Filters - Players can now filter beneficial spells cast upon
them and their pets. By right-clicking on any active buff showing in
your Effects window, you can select to remove it and/or select that it
will never be allowed to take effect on your character again. Pet
owners can also click off buff icons in the Pet window and apply
filters to them. The list of spells being blocked can be found in the
Blocked Buffs or Blocked Pet Buffs windows in the Character section of
your EQ menu. 

- New Bank Space - Available bank space has been increased by 8 slots.

- /Claim Item - If you have received the Prophecy of Ro /claim item
from the retail box, Stable Ward Kyle in the Bazaar may be able to
help you use it to upgrade your old horse to a warhorse. Paladins or
Shadowknights who have the Holy or Unholy Steed AAs and the /claim
item can upgrade their special mounts to a warhorse by visiting Stable
Ward Rames as well.

- New Tradeskills - Event Coordinator Baublie Diggs has a test for you
to prove your abilities!

See the Prophecy of Ro manual (Prophecy_of_Ro.pdf) downloaded to your
EverQuest directory for more information! 



******************
***Live Updates***
******************

*** Zone Revamps ***

- Freeport has been redone. East, West, and North Freeport have been
replaced with a brand new East and West Freeport. All your old friends
should still be there and more.

- Desert of Ro recreated. North Ro, Oasis, and South Ro have been
replaced with a new North Ro and South Ro. Watch out for Sand Giants
while checking out the new scenery.


*** New Guild Functionality ***

- There is now an "Alt" button to flag a member of the guild as an alt
character (this can be done by an officer on anyone, and by anyone on
themselves).

- The "Hide Alts" button will hide anyone in the guild list who is
flagged as an alt. This defaults to off.

- A "B" is no longer appended to the status of bankers. Instead there
are two new columns, Banker and Alt, which have the status in them.
You can sort by either Banker or Alt by clicking on the header.


*** New Raid Functionality ***

- There is a new raid loot option: Entire Raid. This will allow any
raid member to loot NPCs killed by the raid.


*** New Hot Zones ***

- The time has come to once again update the "Hot Zones" throughout
Norrath. The previous zones have been reverted to their former states
and the following zones are now a great place to go for experience and
fun:

Level 20: Najena 
Level 25: Iceclad Ocean 
Level 30: Rathe Mountains 
Level 35: Frontier Mountains 
Level 40: Gulf of Gunthak 
Level 45: Velketor's Labrynth 
Level 50: Fungus Grove 
Level 55: Old Sebilis 
Level 60: Cazic Thule 


*** Spells ***

- Increased the duration and lowered the mana cost of Talisman of the
Tribunal.

- The Test of Efficiency spell should no longer conflict with Peace of
the Disciple or Grace of the Order.

- Increased the damage and lowered the mana on Touch of Inruku to
better match the rest of the spell line's progression.


*** AAs ***

- The way that the wizard AA Mana Burn works has been modified. The
new version will use a maximum of 3000 mana instead of draining your
whole pool and will do 4 damage for every point of mana spent. This is
a raw channeling of magical energy that cannot be focused and will not
critically hit. The ability is unresistable by normal creatures, but
certain special creatures may be immune to the effects. Like the
previous version, once a Mana Burn ability has affected a target, no
other Mana Burn abilities will be able to affect that target for the
next minute. Upgraded versions of the ability, Mana Blast and Mana
Blaze, are available at level 65 and level 70 and use a maximum of
6000 and 9000 mana respectively. The original Mana Burn ability has
been refunded and can be repurchased by Wizards interested in the new
version.

- Gift of Mana will no longer be used up when you cast a 0 mana spell
and now has a chance to trigger on heals other than just instant
heals, including heal-over-time and percent healing spells.

- Rogues and Bards have a new AA ability called Thief's Intuition.
This ability goes hand-in-hand with the new trap system and allows
those classes a chance to automatically sense nearby traps. The new
AAs can be found in the Class tab. 

- There are new special mounts available for Paladins and
Shadowknights under the Class AA tab.


*** Events ***

- The planar projection for defeating Mithaniel Marr was not rewarding
the correct character flags. This has been fixed.

- Raids in Dynamic zones in Gates of Discord now require a minimum of
12 people to be started.

- Sendaii the Hive Queen raid will now lock out the expedition after
the glowing egg is broken.

- NPC�s should no longer re-spawn after being killed in the
Controlling the Beast mission set in Stoneroot Falls.

- The mission "Taking Control" from Stoneroot Falls now only requires
3 people to start it.

- Adjusted the rewards on monster missions so they scale better based
on how long it�s actually taking to complete the mission.

- It should be much more difficult for Stefan Marsinger to die within
one of the Greater Faydark spires.

- Various magician epic mobs should no longer double, triple, or
quadruple spawn for every mage that enters the zone.

- A number of changes were made to the Demi-Plane of Blood, including
pathing fixes, tuning tweaks, and bonuses for defeating Mayong. For
more information, see the EQLive forums.


*** Missions ***

- Monster Mission XP rewards have tuned to better account for the
amount of time required to complete the mission. Longer missions now
give more XP while shorter missions give less. In addition, the way XP
is rewarded has been refactored so it scales better as you gain
levels.

- In Stoneroot Falls, mission givers Kelliad and Widdlethorpe will now
offer you missions that you have completed previously in each of their
story arcs when requesting the mission that you are currently on.


*** Tasks ***

- Added a timer to normal tasks. You can now only complete a task once
every 15 minutes. As with shared tasks, the time counts from when you
initially get the task, so if it took you longer than 15 minutes to
complete the task, you can immediately get another one. 


*** Tradeskills ***

- Alchemy has undergone some changes resulting in modifications to old
recipes as well as introducing new recipes and potions, smoother
progression in the skill, and significant cost reductions.

- Potions - All old-style (10 charge, non stackable) alchemical
potions have been removed and replaced by an equivalent potion in the
revamped system. These new potions are stackable up to 20 per stack.
Note: Due to an error that did not show up on our testing, this was
not completed, but only partially done. Some players will have their
items exchanged, some will not. The old potions will still function,
despite the fact that there will be no way to make them. You can still
make the new potions using the new recipes once the community
discovers them. We will correct this error and do this exchange the
next patch after it has been re-tested.

- Recipes - All recipes that point to the old-style alchemical potions
no longer exist. New recipes have been created for all of the new
potions and will use new herbs. 

- Herbs - Many old herbs have had their prices altered and new herbs
have been introduced, both as purchased components as well as dropped
components. 

- Planar Fletching Kits are now tradeable.

- Changed Othmir Short Beer to use a bottle instead of a Cask.

- Deep Orc Essence now requires less meat.

- Disabled the spell research creation of the spell Draught of
Lightning. This was done because it is a quest derived spell.

- Some very old erudite only combines have had their trivials adjusted
up from being no-fail to on par with other combines of that era.

-The Research Recipe to make Unholy Bellow has been disabled.

- The Rusty Mining Pick used by Druids has changed names, but works
exactly the same.


*** Items ***

- Changed the Slot12 Tradeskill augments that have Cleave, Ferocity,
Furious Bash, Improved Dodge, Improved Parry and Sharpshooting to be
worn effects instead of focus effects.

- Made a few minor modifications to damage ratios on some of the
Demi-Plane of Blood weapons.

- Set a cap on the maximum amount of skill bonuses you can get from
certain worn effects. The caps are for bash (100), backstab (125),
dragon punch (100), eagle strike (100), flying kick (100), kick (100),
round kick (100), tiger claw (100), and frenzy (125).


*** General Bug Fixes ***

- Players will no longer see their breath in first person while on a
boar mount.

- Froglok jump animation will now play at normal speed.

- Skeleton illusions will now function correctly on boar mounts.

- PCs will no longer warp to the location they were charmed or feared
when those spells wear off.

- The autofire ability will now turn off when a player sits down or
loots a corpse.

- Charmed PCs will no longer disappear after being stationary for a
few seconds.

- When alt-tabbing out of full screen mode and then re-entering the
game, you should now properly be put back into full screen mode into
of windowed mode.

- Players marked as group leaders in a raid would sometimes not have
functioning leader abilities. This could happening when reforming
groups in the raid and has been fixed.

- Players will no longer remain encumbered by coin after donating that
coin to a guild tribute master.

- If a player is wearing an item with a focus effect and casts a
delayed spell that utilizes that focus effect, it will no longer be
negating if they use a clicky effect before it lands.

- Fixed sync issues with removing shared tasks and tasks from a
player.

- Throwing axes will no longer throw an entire stack, instead only a
single axe will be consumed from the range slot.

- The map window should now be available to all players.

- Fixed a problem that was causing several of the Dragons of Norrath
items to have the wrong colors.
