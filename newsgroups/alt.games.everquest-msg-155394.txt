I have no AA points yet.  Being a tradeskiller, I would be very tempted to
raise my wisdom up a few points, that would put me at 255 with KEI.  I know,
tradeskilling is a disease, but, I just can't help myself.  That being said,
I'd still go for run speed, and regen before wisdom, I think, maybe,
depending on how many skillups I got recently probably.  :b
