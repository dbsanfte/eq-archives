Id feel a little miffed if I was a level 29 druid. By 34 you can kill hill
giants, but its so damn overcamped in RM. It would be nice if they at least
gave newish players a chance, with some zones they could earn some cash in,
without having to fight for spawns against level 60's with KEI runing
rampant.
Personally ill be glad if theres less unsolicited tells asking for ports.
