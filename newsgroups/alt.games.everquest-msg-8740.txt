Does anyone know the formula used to determine the damage you take from a
MOB?

I realize there are probably a couple stats involved.

ie.  For a hit it checks your AC, AGI (or DEX?), maybe your level vs MOBs,
your defense, MOB's offense and a random number. (maybe even what you are
doing, casting, sitting, facing back??)

But how about the damage, the system determines it can hit you, what stats
help you to reduce damage?



Thanks in Advance
