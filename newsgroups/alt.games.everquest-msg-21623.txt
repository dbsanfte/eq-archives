When I pull, I time the spawns and if I'm pulling correctly you'll
only get the chance to heal me when you are over 80 mana.  Constant
pulling and watching the clock and keeping track of what is due to
spawn and where the spawn should be is a puller's job.  I depend on
you, the cleric, to manage health. I'm too busy managing spawns to
ever consider my health, I completely trust you to do your job.

You have got to tell me to stop pulling or I won't.  sorry, but I'm
tracking spawns and watching the time.  You track my health, your mana
and watch my  health bar.  We'll constantly pull blues and we'll make
damn good experience if we both do our jobs right.
