You have to admit it is pretty annoying when the large higher level shaman 
(that'd be me) tells the rest of the party to run because there is no way 
in hell he's going to survive not to mention their scrawny elven butts. And 
then they all insist on standing there wacking at a large group of mobs 
that must all be red to them (I know they were to me). And then they have 
the audasity to get upset when they die. Madness.

Ok, I know that came out slightly incoherent, but I'm tired, so there. ;-P
