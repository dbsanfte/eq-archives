But it would be impossible to stay undetected.

If somebody suddenly has one during a random inspection, and the loot DB
proves they werent awarded one, the alarm bells start ringing.

And honestly, if you sacrificed the (guaranteed forthcoming) elemental loot
for a 100hp/mana ring you'd be a pretty big fool.  Not to mention their ass
would never be in a big guild again, last I checked vindi and statue didn't
upgrade any of my guild

I do agree that in many guilds that can be a problem, and that innocent
until proven guilty must remain in normal cases, but this isnt one.

Anyway you can't lie about it, if you wear it and its spotted - the games
up.

It was ninjad, the gm was an absolute fucktard in his handling of the
situation.  There was zero doubt on who did and didn't kill the mob
