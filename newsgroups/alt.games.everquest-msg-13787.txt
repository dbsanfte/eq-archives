I believe lull reduces the aggro radius of a monster  - so after a successful
cast, you can get closer to a KOS monster without it noticing you.  So it 
won't have any affect on you.

Timing.  If you begin casting just after the monster swings at you, then you
should be able to cast the spell before the next swing (dependant upon the
speed of the spell and the swinging of course).  This is less possible when
there's more than one monster, or your connection is bad.

At level 4, you can go and train channeling - this will help prevent
interruptions, although it's still better not to get avoid hits when you're
casting.

Soon you'll meet monsters that can bash.  Bashing can stun you, and stunning
interrupts casting no matter what. Then you will have to time your casting
around bashes as well (bashing is often at a different rate to normal hits)
