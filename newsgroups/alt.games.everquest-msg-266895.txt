Whatever makes you think it is going to make them more money?

I stopped paying for eq1 and am going to pay for wow. Sony lost all of my 
dollars and since the wow open beta got capped at 500,000 people methinks 
sony is losing far more than just me. The biggest problem wow has right now 
, and it is a huge problem is overcrowding lagg.

Eq2 is going to be just as big a flop as star wars was.

Eq1 has been dying for a long time now. Even with full time raid gear I 
could not solo solid blue mobs. The mob mudflation was ridiculously out of 
line leaving only  raid game. Truth be told many of us raided alot but did 
not actually enjoy it all that much. The first time or two on each mob was 
fun but xegony 14 is just a pain in the arse.
