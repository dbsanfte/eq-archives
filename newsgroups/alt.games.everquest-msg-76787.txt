You can do it with the mouse, not certain off hand how.  To do it with the
keyboard, hold the ctrl key down, and the forward arrow, and the left or
right arrow.  You can switch between left and right while you are doing it
as well.  It works great, keeps you a bit ahead of the mobs.  It has saved
my butt many times with my nonsowing characters.
