I thought it was very rude of people to drop money instead of
destroying it anyway, it takes about .3 seconds longer to destroy it.
Dropping causes bugs for somepeople where they lock up if they sit
on/near it or they pick it up to destroy and then go LD.

I always thought they should really have a toggle to autodestroy
silver, copper and perhaps even gold for monks. Heck, make it  a skill
monks get or something.. ahaa.
