Clerics have the same fear line, all the way up to Trepidation.  They -do- have
an undead only fear, but unlike druids, its not the only fear line they get.  I
was never able to see the use for the undead only fear line clerics get, either,
since its single target, generic fear works just as well.  An AE fear only
versus undead might be amusing, since you could use it to pick off undeads out
of a cluster with live prey... but no such cluster of mixed undead live comes to
mind.

Druids, wizards, bards, beastlords, and shaman might want to have a word with
the committee voting necro ultimate solo class.  I do think Mages will be
willing to let this slide though.
