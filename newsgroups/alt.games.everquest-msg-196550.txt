All the newbie zones and starting cities I have seen on Stromm have been 
veritable stampedes of new characters running around like crazy and 
spamming the /ooc channel with nonsense. Basically, a huge percentage of 
all players are below level 10 right now, so that's where they're going to 
be. Additionally, the froglok is still the novel thing to be for those 
overly concerned with the superficial - no offense to those who aren't but 
also choose that race.  ;-)

It will taper off in time. People will level up, people will get frustrated 
with the prospect of doing for themselves, but right now, it is pretty 
crazy with everyone vying for the same mobs, quest item and such.
