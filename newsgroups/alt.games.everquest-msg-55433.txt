 I have to say that I really enjoy javelins. Throwing with a range of 205
and usable by monks, warriors and rogues (might be others, not sure). You
have to smith them yourself, but I think they're worth it for those hard
splits. With that distance I have plenty of time to feign if I get an
unintentional multiple pull (I know you're a warrior and don't get feign,
that's why monks are cooler, lol)
