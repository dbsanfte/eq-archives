It's been a great week.  I've grouped and grouped and grouped.  Levels were
flying by and exp was unreal.  I made a lot of friends and enjoyed every group
I had.  I wen't 20-0 on my Necro in LDoN's.  But alas, all good things must
come to an end.  I pick up my wife and child at the airport today.  They're
coming back from visiting the in-laws and it'll be back to having a tough time
trying to find an hour to play EQ for me.  Grouping will go back to being
almost out of the question since I'll never know when I'm gonna be ordered to
go clean up after the dog.  Anyway, it was a lot of fun.
