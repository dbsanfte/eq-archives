Get an Enchanter around your level and the Bloodgill Goblins in LOIO will
give you so much exp the dings will come so rapidly it will sound like
church bells at a wedding. The chanter is the key as you need to kill them
quick (haste/slow) and control them (mez) so only one bloodgill is in the
fight.
