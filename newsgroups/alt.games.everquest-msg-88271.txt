From what I've read it appears to be an ATI video card related problem.
I've had the same problem with my ATI Radeon 64mb DDR VE card since
Luclin released.  I also have a problem with the boats looking
"exploded" while sitting on them.  Fortunately as a druid, I don't carry
a weapon very often let alone swing one.  So I guess I'm lucky to avoid
the "inside-of-your-head" bug most of the time.
