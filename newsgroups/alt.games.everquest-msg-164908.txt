Both corpses timed out, found out later the presumed level 65 with
uberguild tag is low 50s so that char was getting exp (but grouped
with the level 63, I am sure there are stupider ways to PL but none
spring to mind), found out that the level 63 was botting both chars
(the second belonging to his wife) and had fallen asleep at the wheel.
No, when I saw them back in Chardok later on, with a 61 mage and I
think one more for company, all 4 working a camp I solo at 60 for the
elusive hammer, I did not tell them it'd dropped that morning :)
