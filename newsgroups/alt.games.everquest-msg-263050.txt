Actually patchwork jetsam isn't out of line at 35. It drops off mid 30s 
mobs in Gunthak. But I agree it is one of the best weapons I've ever 
seen drop of mid 30s mobs.

Indeed. Its pretty clear that the SK was not taunting, or he would have 
grabbed aggro immediately and held it once you downgraded weapons.
 
Given taunt, spear, clinging darkness, and jolts, he should be able to 
grab aggro pretty quickly for fairly low mana cost.

If you seriously out damage him, he might have to really work at keeping 
it though.

Particularly the no-haste. Its hard to get haste as a low level without 
spending a k+ in the bazaar.

The gripping hand? =) Was that a reference to Moties?

Or perhaps it was working best as it was?? Depending on what you were 
fighting, who was healing, and your comparative gear it might have been 
simpler and more effective to just MT until the SK took aggro. Between 
iksar regen, iksar ac bonus, and mend...

I know I let the monk I group with tank mobs often as he can usually 
mend/regen on subsequent fights while I tank. And this reduces the 
healing burden on the cleric by about 20%.
