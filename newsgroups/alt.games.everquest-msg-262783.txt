They've changed it a few times, but I believe the current situation is:
  - summoned pets take no (or almost no) xp.
  - charmed pets take 1/3 of their proportinal damage in xp.

So if a charmed pet does 1/4 of the damage to a mob, it takes 1/12 of the xp.
When soloing, charmed pets do almost all the damage, so take 1/3 of the xp.

One workaround is to KS from your pet.  Basically, let the pet beat down
the target to almost-dead, then back it off, memblur the target (so your pet
has no "credit" for it's damage), and nuke it the rest of the way.  Full xp
for the cost of a nuke and a blur.  Alternately, don't slow the target
or haste the pet.  When both pet and target are near-death, release the
pet, nuke it for full xp then nuke the target for full xp.  

Depending on situation, it can cost more in terms of kill-rate to do this
than to just accept the reduction in xp per mob.  In an xp group, it almost
always is a benefit to accept the cost and just kill as fast as possible.
