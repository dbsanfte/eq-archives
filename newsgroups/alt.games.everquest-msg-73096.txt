Must be on your server Dennis, because when I have hunted in NK, I have
never had any trouble finding beetles among other mobs.  I am not going to
get into an argument over who solos best.  I certainly won't claim that my
shammy solos better than either a wizard or a ranger.  It takes me a while,
but I can generally solo a dark blue, ending the fight at full mana and
health using root and rot.  But, as I said, it takes me a while, certainly
longer than a ranger fear kiting, or a wizard quad kiting.
