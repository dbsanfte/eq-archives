Because "toon" from "cartoon" or "avatar" or any number of other terms used
are all, *at first glance*, understandable.  When someone said "I gotta
switch toons and get that out of the bank" the first time, you *knew* what
they meant, even if you'd never heard the term before.  It's basis
is undeniable.

Don't take this wrong.  I have never used the term "toon" in my life, and
probably never will.  I have no problems with those who do, though.  Nor do
I have problems with "avatar" or "PC", both of which I also don't use
(though I may have used PC once or twice, it's just too confusing to use
regularly).
