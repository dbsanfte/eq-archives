Heh.  Got a good laugh out of this.  Thanks.

Bards tank worse than rangers, maybe slightly better than rogues.  You 
can heal, but at an astoundingly slow rate.  So as long as you can put 
battles on pause for 5 minutes while the MT sits down and you play your 
song, you guys make _great_ healers!  

You guys are VERY good for very short term buffs, but you can't do huge 
healing or damage all at once and your stuff doesn't last for longer than 
a few minutes at best after you've switched songs.

That said, one of my favorite people to have around is a good bard.  You 
didn't even mention a couple of the things they're incredibly good at: 
buffs (melee, haste, resists) and crowd control.  Not to mention selo's 
rocks my world.  I do have a screenshot of a lvl 62 Bard asking me for 
SoW though *grin*.

PS: stfu and play the heart song, damnit.
