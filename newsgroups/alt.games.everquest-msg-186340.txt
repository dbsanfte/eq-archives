Now, that's a horse of an entirely different color.  If you wish to venture
into the theoretical with some as of yet unwritten game, by all means do so.

You sound like some programmers I used to work with (emphasis on 'used to').
Their line of thought was (and still is) "We'll make it, and the end users
will deal with it".  No.  You interview your end users ... listen to them
tell you what will make their jobs easier (it's called 'Analysis') ... then
design the system around those needs, within the limits that your
architecture and the law of your business (manufacturing, healthcare, etc.)
will allow.  You see, that's how you make a system that your end users will
use and, for the most part, appreciate.

If, in your line of work, the system was hindering you, would you not want
to talk to someone about making changes to it?  The same should go for game
design, I would think.  Listen to what your player base is griping about,
and try to fix it as best you can.

OMG, what utter bullshit.  I'll not throw out the ususal terms for this
attitude ... I'll only say that I shan't address it any further (although
I'd really like to) because the horse has been beaten to death and the
carcass is drawing flies.

No.  Try as you might make it, running or sitting on one's ass is not a
game, imagination or not.  I remember when I started my cleric ... and
stopped playing him because all I did was look at my spellbook.   There's
not a great deal of difference in staring at a spellbook and staring at the
ground to make sure you're still on the path, or looking at the clouds to
make sure you're still running in the right direction.

How about trying to hook up with my RL friends, who may be in widely varying
zones, for the aforementioned 2 hours of gaming time?  Oh wait, only 2 hours
per session makes me a casual player, and therefore a bane to your
existence.  Never mind.

See the above reference to my being a casual player (and being a bane to
your existence).

By all means, get a few programmers together and build a game of your own.
Build it exactly as you like it.  Market it.  Set up the servers, and patch
them regularly.  And if your end users don't like the game environment
you've put before them, what will you do?

Once you get in the mindset of someone who's designing things, you'll see
that you have two choices ... cater to your end users, or go out of
business.
