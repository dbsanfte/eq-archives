And what law are they interpreting, that gives them the right to make 
private property public?  It's the court's job to decide what the law -is-, 
not what it should be.  There is no rational link between Fred Meyer's 
invitation to the public, and a loss of his own property rights.  Nor is 
there a link between his invitation and the establishment becoming "a forum 
for assembly by the community."  This is not jurisprudence, this is 
legislation from the bench.
