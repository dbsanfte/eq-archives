Actually, it's not "the" intro island.  That is, it is not like Isle of
Refuge in EQ2 that everybody starts in.  WoW is like EQ1 in that there are
several starting areas that you can leave at any time.  That particular one
just happens to be on an island.

The only jerks I've seen up to level 19 have been some people very soon
after launch, when they were having quite a bit of server downtime.  Some
people came over to my server, which is a role play server, when there
server was down, specifically to try to annoy role players.
