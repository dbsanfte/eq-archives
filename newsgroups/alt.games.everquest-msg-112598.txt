I'm just wondering if there's anyone on the cazic-thule server that might be
willing to help me out on what might be the best way to master tailoring and
jewelry making:)
I've looked at websites on how but cant find any that help me enough.....

And maybe there's some low level ppl that might be interested in doing some
group play???
