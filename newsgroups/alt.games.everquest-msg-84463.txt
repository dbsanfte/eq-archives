Well duh, we can check a persons health bar. Im sure we all needed to be
told that.
Like i said elsewhere, 9/10 people helping me do it when I dont need it.
Some are a plain nuisance.
Im sure they knew how to check health bars too.

I dont criticize your motives, but you wont get it right 100% of the time.
maybe you will just waste your time/mana. Maybe you will interfere with
them. I dont want to see people die, and I can understand where you are
coming from, but I still think you are wrong to jump in if there is no yell.
