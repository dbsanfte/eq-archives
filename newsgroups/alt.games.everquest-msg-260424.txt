This may sound sort of a wierd suggestion, but I have been 
factioning a 65 pally in Nurga dragging around a 56 
druid....well, I am factioning the pally=)

Anywhooo .. if you look at a map of nurga, you see that if you 
drop down the waterfall, it sort of resolves into 2 killing 
areas, one is 81 spawn points of pertty much green to paly/light 
and DBlue to druid

http://eqatlas.com/kunark/nurga1map.html

the loop of the waterfall room/FM zonelines, and the rooms marked 
2, slave pits, and then up the ramp, and a tunnel back to the FM 
zoneine area...This circut paly only gets faction and loot, but 
the druid gets exp...

The other half of the dungeon, which has most of the named spawn 
points is a bit higher, light blue, some green and a handful of 
dark blues to the 65 paly, a total of some 130 spawn points ...
last night a crawl got about 2k plat of goodies, and 80% of an aa 
point, with my pair and a friends 63 shaman.  Also gets you 
faction in chardok, Paly is now amiable=)

Don't know what you call good xp, but 80% of an aa point, with 2 
over 60 and 1 56 sucking up xp is pretty decent in my book. The 
druid got 56% of an aa point, and 30% of a level. I have her set 
on 50/50 and the palys leadership was turned off.
