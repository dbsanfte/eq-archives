Not exactly. A Berserker, as far as I can tell, doesn't make a good
primary tank. They seem to have the defenses of a Ranger. However,
they have MUCH better damage output than a warrior, in addition to
their spell-like axe skills. As for which class is better, it all
depends on what you want to do. If you want to tank, a warrior is
better. If you wanna put out lots of damage, go berserker.

Race is nearly irrelevant once you get out of newbie-dom. Biggest race
advantage belongs to ogres for their no stun from front ability. Other
than that, just go with whatever you think looks best.

goberserker.com or eqberserker.com will have good info and tips for
the class. Overall, I prefer beastlords for a DPS class...
