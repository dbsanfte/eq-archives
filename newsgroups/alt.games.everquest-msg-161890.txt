Oh good god, please, no.

Please, for the love of all that is holy, teach your son the meaning
of personal responsibility.  Our guild has recently suffered the wrath
of parents who were pissed off because when their kid (level 17 char)
came in and said "can someone go rez me in LOIO cuz I don't feel like
running past the spiders", he got short shrift. ::rolls eyes::

Oh, and teach him how to speak, too.  Turns out the kid's corpse was
actually *lost*, and since the kid only asked for a cleric, and only
explained it in a way that made us all think "wow, lazy", my necro
felt no need to respond.

Well, except with "wtf do you need a rez for at 17?" - I don't think
his mom likes me anymore ;p
