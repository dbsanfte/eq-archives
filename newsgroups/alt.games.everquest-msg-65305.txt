Zackron's Attorney: "Your honor, my client purchased EverQeust, Ruins of
Kunark 18 months ago, and now the defendant has changed the system
requirements and the game will no longer play."

Judge: "I see. Well, that doens't sound fair at all. However, since the
game did function properly for 18 months, I can't award you full
damages. Judgement for the plaintif in the amount of $3.25. Adjourned."

Verant Atty: "Damnit, we lost! Anybody got $3.25 on them for this bozo?"

Zackron: "Well, we didn't get much, but at least we got a moral victory
and proved something to those bastards at Verant."

Zack's Atty: "Exactly! You've struck a blow for right thinking consumers
everywhere. By the way, my flat fee for a single court room appearance
is $375.  Do you want to write me a check, or should I have my secretary
bill you?"
