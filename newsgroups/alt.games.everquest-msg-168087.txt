Allright, when I hit 40 I can finally group with my guildies in a meaningful
way (almost all guildmates are 50+). So I would like to get thru these next
5 levels as fast as possible. I am a wizard who enjoys grouping more than
soloing, but not opposed to soloing if I can level faster that way.

BTW, have been in Dawnshroud for last 2 levels and I have every expansion
except POP. Please give advice.
