This is one of the things I liked about my Wizard being a Dark Elf.  Racial
Hide skill comes in very handy when you want to med in a kiting area.

At 55, Wizards get Improved Invisibility: 10 minutes fixed duration (more
with focus).  That is long enough to med back to full from near empty, so it
is perfect.  (And it works while levitating, unlike Hide).
