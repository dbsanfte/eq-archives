You don't need to go underwater to get a corpse in deep water.  Swim
on the surface, or levitate above it, and go out to where you are
above the corpse, target the corpse (you can use "/target foo's
corpse" for this, or use the trick of peeking just below the water so
you can see all the way down to click on it and target it), and then
you can drag it with "/corpse".  "/corpse" doesn't care much about
vertical distance, so it doesn't matter that the corpse is way below
you.
