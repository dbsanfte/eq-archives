    Said in another post, there are 3 main tank classes for groups, and only
one for raids. Warrior's win in that half the of the game. Knights slightly
win out in pop groups only (pre pop very few people ever suggested knights
made better tanks). Warriors are still king of the hill in every other
tanking group you see. Why should they be the best tanking class in every
possible way? They ARE the best at taking damage, they DO have the most
hitpoints and the DO more damage than the two classes who are better than
them at holding agro.

    Any suggestion that they should hold agro as well or better than a
knight deserves a solid stomping. EQ has been far too much about warriors
and clerics for far too long. Another two classes get a peek at what its
like to be good at what you do and everyone's yelling for either nerfs or
ludicrous abilities.

    Mind you I might trade a 100% success taunt for a 100% success snare and
fear. In fact, fuck it, warriors can have group tanking, I'll solo fear kite
dragons and gods.

Cheers,
James
