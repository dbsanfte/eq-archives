This actually sucks, a lot. Why you may ask?

Many of the old mainstay exp zones are empty now. This really screws a lot 
of us on one thing- epics.

For my epic (which I am in the middle of) I needed to camp Targin the Rock. 
Unfortunately, I needed a group, or to FD in the throne room and ask the 
group in the area if the minded me takng him. Group? What group? This same 
issue just repeated itself with my Chardok pipe, from Bridge Two in Chardok 
(not exactly soloable by a 54 Monk ;). OTOH, epics are getting less 
powerful comparatively. The Warrior epic is laughable now, for example.
