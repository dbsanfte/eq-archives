There is little or no strategy involved to playing a druid. Up until level
14 you snare/root and run away far enough to cast damage spells w/o getting
hit. After 14 you just cast Spirit of the Wolf on yourself so you can
outrun/root everything while casting spells.

Only killing blue cons is kind of a waste of time for a druid. It isn't like
they are a melee class that needs lots of equipment to be effective, all
they need is their wis/mana. Killing red cons is a waste of time too IMO
because it takes to long for the experience they give.
