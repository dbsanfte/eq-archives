No. They're games. They're designed as games. They're marketed as
games. They're bought as games. It doesn't become "not a game" just
because you say so.

Many athletes take sports more seriously than people take EQ. That
doesn't make it therefore fine for them to engage in gambling on their
own sports, nor does it make it okay to take steroids. Both these
cases are introducing outside elements that have an impact on the
integrity of the game. It doesn't matter that you or anyone else takes
it seriously, it is still just a game. It's not real. Saying you
consider it real doesn't change the fact that it is a game. Period.

So, how big of an impact does outside interventions have to have on a
game before YOU consider it flat-out cheating?
