The only player you can sucessfully Track are Grouped  members. I belive the
the tracking gets screwed up with neg and pos numbers. Lets say tracking a
friend leads you to -277  400 when actually they are at -277 -400, 277 -400,
or 277 400. Next time it screws up send the person a tell and get their loc.
