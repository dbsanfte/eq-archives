Well, your video card sounds like its built into the motherboard. This 
poses a couple of problems, firstly if you replace it you need to know how 
to disable the onboard video, secondly your motherboard may not have an AGP 
slot since video is built-in, which means you'd have to get a PCI video 
card to replace it and they are, quite frankly, obsolete these days.

Sounds like you may need a new motherboard too to build a halfway decent 
spec machine, at which point you have to ask yourself if its not time to go 
the whole hog and replace the whole thing (well, you can salvage all the 
silly things like case, PSU, floppy, CD drive, maybe HD, etc if you build 
your own).

It would probably be safe to buy lots of RAM (dirt cheap right now) and a 
decent soundcard for your old machine, since you can probably reuse this 
(depending on what RAM it uses, and what RAM a prospective new mobo will 
use).
