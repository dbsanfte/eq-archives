Mostly depends on the situation and gear of the chars.
Most probably this thread will be a shameless plug for dps players where
they can glorify their class :).

As for my own experiences in expgroups the past few weeks:
Mage
Wizard
Archery Ranger
Rogue
Beastlord
Necro
Monk

Last group at PoTactics arena had me at 200 average over 40 fights. Wizard
came second at 190. Ranger puller didn't use nukes to save mana and pulled
when the mob started fleeing so came at 100. Tank was at 90. Cleric and
chanter were not interesting :).
ps. this was fighttime only from first engage till mob's death. All downtime
in between wasn't counted but this was a typical expgroup for me with rather
fast pulls the whole time and a piglet break whenever it came stampeding.
