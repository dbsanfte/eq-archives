Aye, Complete Heal is exempt for it all granted, forgot about that when I
posted.

The Foci effects your other class defining healing spells though, admittedly
with a less of an impact as other classes defining spell lines but still
some none the less.

I think I was wrong anyway

Looking at it with Verants vision of Enchanters.

Enchanter roles in the Vision.
Casts KEI, GRM
Casts Haste
Casts Tash
Casts Mez (Removed from Vision with launch of Velious)

2 out of 3 spell lines have foci for, i.e. ext enhance, Enhance haste etc.
