 Perhaps the corpse will last that long but I think you can only res a
duel corpse for ten minutes.

 You're not going to lose that much experience as long as you get two
resses from a cleric epic. I mean seriously, if you're going to VP not
expecting to lose XP to begin with you may not want to go.

 I'm not sure I'd really bother with the first step mentioned unless I
happened to be a cleric. Just get a bind somewhere and zone into VP. If
you don't make it to a zone out spot you can all just duel out with the
last one to leave being the cleric. It will make it easier if all the
people leaving are bound in the same spot so you may want them to
reconsider a spot to bind where you can bind melees as well. Just make
sure you have two actual xp-lost corpses and not a duel corpse or you
may be in for a surprise.
