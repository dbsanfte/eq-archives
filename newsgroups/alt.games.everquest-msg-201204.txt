No, to be honest unless someone liked the story particulrly Id probably
advise an epic fantasy reader to wait till they were finished and buy the
series to read in one long go. As a current reader I wil be buying them as
they appear like the rest of the current fanbase (or a significant part of
it)

THere are a number of 'epic' moments in the series and the end of Lord of
Chaos is one of them, but its not significant enough to warrant stopping
the book as its not the end of it all. Rand declaring himself the Dragon
Reborn is possibly a point to stop having got a good story (ie 3 books in)
and an idea if the rest of it is worth pursuing to you. The first book by
the nature of being the first book is relatively self contained and
another alternative (in fact I've just seen a version which splits it into
2 books in the shops here in the UK).

Book 2 you'd have to continue on through to 3 at least. Books 4 through to
6 are another major chunk of the story - while there is an ending of
section there its not a big enough one to stop and previously there
seemed to be some jerky editing on the end point of a book which means
more that you need to 'read through'. Seven is action but no
real big sotry ending, 8 (path of Daggers) was edited about badly IMO to
the extent I think two books were made into 3 or one into two. Book 9 is a
massive climactic ending and a point I would suggest you could put down
too. Ten, well lots of nice info - but certain characters are being really
dense and it didnt end at a sensible point for me....its gone to TV
episode endings - doesnt fit a book series for me - cliffhangers are a
short term thing its not a story break its a sharp stop and not a feature
I like particularly.
