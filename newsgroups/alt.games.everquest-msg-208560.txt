Yah its classified "upgrades", but i did expect more than that. This isn't
just another named mob upgrade, this is the ultimate upgrade... and thats
sad! To put it like this... i wasn't drooling.

It should of been kinda like upgrading your Tolapumjs robe with Icicles
robe. Thats more than a lousy 10% upgrade. Velious was a cool expansion, and
so was Luclin, but PoP seems pretty "downbeat" kinda. You would expect more
from levels 61-65 than what was dished out in power to player characters. In
PoP they just beefed up the MOBs by atleast 200% and player characters by
25%.... pffffffffffft. It had many cool ideas, but it was sorely
nerfed/underpowered from a players perspective.

Get the ultimate weapon in Unreal 2 for example... now thats an upgrade even
that late in the game. It kinda like... omg....i can take the world with
this. Ofcourse... i know its a different game, but the sense of achievement
is bigger in U2.
