Yes Dex does have some effect on offensive melee skill-ups. I
personally think it is determined by which ever is highest, Dex, Int,
or Wis. Same goes for Defensive skill-ups except it is determined by
Agi, Int or Wis, IMO. I find that when you play a DE whatever, the
skill-ups come incredibly fast, all of them. They have a base Int of
99, not saying they make good tanks though, can't beat an Ogre
Warrior. No stun from the front > every other racial ability, for a
tank.

Practice all weapon skills. You never know when you will come across
that great 2H Blunt, with an insane proc (that taunts as well), and
you have a skill of 2 in 2H Blunt.
