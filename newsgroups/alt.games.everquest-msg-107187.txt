My /petition experiences I've had.

1) My Ogre Warrior was running from a mob in Oasis and ran up over a little
crack in the wall, fell behind into a portion where the ground was lower and
I couldn't jump out, at the same time I couldn't fall for damage so couldn't
die.  /ooc /shout and no one would port me out or even kill me in /duel to
let me drag myself out.  Finally /petition and the GM (didn't have guides
back then, this was mid 2000) came in and checked to see how inescapeable it
was.  They then summoned me out.

2) Had to report an annoying kid running around in EC with a name, something
similar to "hardcorre". I might have let it go if not for his attitude when
no one in my group wanted to group with someone of that name.  No big deal
here, just a name change was all (I only report these types of names, there
are plenty of others to report the c00l d00dz kid names).

3) One weekend I was with my Halfling Druid in Qeynos, the next day,
slightly over 24 hrs later I passed by a pond (the one in that area just to
the right after you enter North Qeynos) and the same guard was still stuck
in the same place, treading water in the middle of the pond non stop (got to
admire his stamina though, 24 real hrs is how many days for Norath?).  After
about an hour or so I just happened to be passing by and thought I'd check
up on him.  2 GMs were there, they mentioned he wouldn't obey so they had to
use deadly force.  Again, no big deal here, but just one to make them aware
of and they'll get to it when they can (like a minor /bug report).

4) When grouping with my Barbarian Warrior in Permafrost (just inside, we
were only LV12 or low teens), one of the group was constantly cussing.
After many of the group complained about his foul mouth towards everyone
(for anything from not getting enough EXP to having to zone from a bad pull,
or just because he wanted to cuss us out), I eventually /petition and
/report to show his language problem (he also had a naming violation to
throw in there, just to drop his credibility even more).  The /report was
easy to find incriminating evidence.  The challenge would be to find a line
of chat text he said that did not contain abusive language towards anyone.

And also another good thing to have for the long waits for a GM is /gems
(it's still there right?).
