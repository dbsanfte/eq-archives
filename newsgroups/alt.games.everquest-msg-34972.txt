18/37? Sounds like a Runic Carver to me. Try looking out for;

Jarsath Battle Sword 26/45
Earthen Blade 26/50 Proc haste (faster than that of an Ex Axe)
Blade of Xalgoz 23/40 +3str/agi
Nathsar Great Sword 17/30 +10str
All the above should be under 500pp now

Drakkel Icereaver 24/40 proc Icerend (30pnt DD)
Mithril Twohander 21/40 Perm effect of haste makes the weapon 21/31
Both of these are under 1k. 700pp would be a good deal for either (seen the
Icereaver for 500 and under on occasion)

Or
Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword 24/39
about 200 - 300 plat but on the down side looks like a short sword and isn't
black (erm, Verant please explain)
on the plus side it has a better damage delay ratio than all the above
except the Mith (with it's haste) AND you are of a level that could get it
yourself (in a group) Drops in Runnyeye off Picklaw Destroyers upto Lord
Pickclaw.

> Also, what is the best weapon for a warrior? And whats the ATK and delay
on it?

Most of the real high end items are no drop (I'd prefer to see them Level
limited as no drop means that only Uber Guild members are ever likely to
wield one)

Tempered Velium Claidhmore
32/35 2hs
Will set you back 20k +

But this one does it for me;

Twisted Steel Bastard Sword
33/35
AC: +25 Str: +10 Sta: +10 Magic Resist: +7 Fire Resist: +7 Cold Resist: +7
Poison Resist: +7 Disease Resist: +7
Weight: 0.0

but this is likely considered the daddy

Primal Velium Claidhmore
33/35
AC: +10 Str: +5 Sta: +5 Agi: +5 Dex: +5 Wis: +5 Int: +5 Cha: +5 Magic
Resist: +5 Fire Resist: +5 Cold Resist: +5 Poison Resist: +5 Disease Resist:
+5 HP: +50 Mana: +50
Proc: Avatar (+100 Strength,  Dexterity, Agility, and Attack)

Both are no drop so I won't be wielding either anytime soon...or at all I
should imagine.
