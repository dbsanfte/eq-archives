Most, if not all, of my GM experiances have been good.  Just tonight,
we had a train pulled on us in NRo, at Derv 2.  The puller died, and
we lost our healer(a guildie of mine, *fume*).

[Wed Jun 19 18:55:26 2002] You told zhog, '[queued], thanks for the
train '
[Wed Jun 19 18:55:35 2002] You tell your party, 'zhog trained us'


The conducter showed no remorse, and in fact gave us a hard time of
it:

[Wed Jun 19 18:55:58 2002] Zhog tells you, 'thanks for the help'

!!

[Wed Jun 19 18:56:26 2002] You told Zhog, 'we had no obligation to
help you'
[Wed Jun 19 19:01:03 2002] Zhog says, 'Bite me'
[Wed Jun 19 19:01:51 2002] You say, 'i'm giving you the benefit of the
doubt that you didn't train us on purpose and not /reporting you'
[Wed Jun 19 19:02:15 2002] Zhog says, 'Ask me if I care'

I didn't.

[Wed Jun 19 19:03:50 2002] Zhog says, 'I'm just going to stay here and
KS on your group'
[Wed Jun 19 19:03:59 2002] You say, 'oh?'
[Wed Jun 19 19:04:04 2002] Reporting last 10 lines in chat display
concerning Zhog.
[Wed Jun 19 19:04:39 2002] You petition, 'My /report concerns derv 2
in Nro, if anyone cares to investigate'

[Wed Jun 19 19:37:01 2002] Valbin tells you, 'Greetings, Guide Valbin
here.  What seems to be the problem?'
[Wed Jun 19 19:37:33 2002] You told Valbin, 'we had a KSer eariler,
but he seems to have left us alone now ;)'
[Wed Jun 19 19:37:41 2002] Winladar tells the group, 'Incoming a
Dervish Cutthroat!'
[Wed Jun 19 19:37:42 2002] Valbin tells you, 'Ok, let us know if he
comes back please.'
[Wed Jun 19 19:37:46 2002] Valbin tells you, 'BTW, what was his name?'
[Wed Jun 19 19:37:56 2002] You told Valbin, 'Zhog, thanks for your
response'

[Wed Jun 19 19:38:13 2002] Valbin bows before Ameena.
[Wed Jun 19 19:38:15 2002] Asane tells the guild, 'Sooo how is
everyone doin? lol'
[Wed Jun 19 19:38:15 2002] Valbin waves goodbye to Ameena.

I didn't see him, so I guess he was(quite rightly so) being invis to
catch the KSer in the act.
Sorry for turning this into such a long rave, but Valbin is a good
guy.
