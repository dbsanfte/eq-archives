One thing I thought that was cool with the new interface was
the new character selection screen. If you hit the 'Explore' button
you can look around a little starting room that is different for
each character class. For instance My monk had a Dojo room
and the Enchanter had a Library type magic room.

Totally useless and eye candy but definitely had a coolness
factor about it. =)

Now what would be cool is if we could each get a room like that
for each character that had chests and storage area. Maybe even
see your horse resting in a stable area. Also, be able to get in game
items for your room like a journal, quest log, map book. Perhaps even
magic items like chests that store more items, a log for the fire that
sped up healing and meditation. Hell even throw in some furniture that
looks cool but doesn't do really anything.
