Not sure if the above doesn't disqaulify me, ;-0  but here goes:

I think you answered your own question perfectly.  I think most of are
in awe of uber-characters and drool over some of the stuff you're
considering upgrading, but the plain fact is that even people in
time-capable guilds are dripping with uber-gear in every slot.

So LDoN does provide a nice alternative, with some gear that cannot be
gotten any other way, provided you're willing to spend the time.
That's not to say thatthere isn't better stuff out there, just an
alternate path to get some gear.  Considering the amount of time you'd
need to spend raiding, to get a chance on gear that is also desired by
another 20 people on the same raid, your chances look much better at
doing the LDoN runs.   

I think if you make the fact that you're going for point, and not the
usual 'easy xp'type groups that I see in the mid-40's, you may be able
to reach your goal reasonably quickly.  If everyone agrees to try and
maximize the number of missions you can get them done farily quickly.
Then it's just a quick gate and a new mission for the group leader
without the usual downtime associated.

So I'd say give it a try.  Give yourself a wekk and see how close you
are to the goal.  Decide from there if you want to continue.  YOu can
always use the points for something else if you happen to get that
Raid loot in the meantime.

Good luck!
