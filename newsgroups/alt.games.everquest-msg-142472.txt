I started the quest last week, everything went ok until I got to the
part where you turn in the ring from Challice to Arantir. So I turn in
the ring to the female vendor in Halas, she turns into Arantir.
Unfortunately the guy did *not* want to talk to me at all. After a few
mins he depops.
Tried asking a GM but gave up after 3 hrs waiting.
I don't know if this means I'm screwed... just decided to collect the
items I need now and hope.
