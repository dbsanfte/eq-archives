Using that logic I guess no monks either then.
When *I* set up a group here's my tell:  "we've got cleric, shaman, paladin
puller, chanter... need a couple more for LDON.  Interested?"
Or, "we've got a cleric shaman beastie and we need a good puller and tanks. 
Interested?  And can you pull?"
I make it clear what I'm looking for.  *Especially* if we need a puller.  And
if you aren't up to being the puller please just say so :)
