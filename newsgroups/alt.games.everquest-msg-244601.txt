I know nothing of Tribunal, so I'll give some recommendations on my former
server.
Try Company of Shadows, Morell Thule. (really, level 11 is 5 hours, so you
are not out that much) Their idea of a raid is Seb. You might have some
trouble finding low levels to group with, though I didn't have too much
trouble with my last alt. Guildleader is ... ur uh.. well their website is
http://brak.dedris.com/shadows/
Excuse the mess.. I don't think they ever got another webmaster after I
left.

There are a few idiots in the guild.. or were, but for the most part they
are good people. And we had our share of 'we want to be uber raider' types,
but I think most of them moved on.

Also good on Morell Thule used to be Random Acts... If I had ever left CoS I
would have gone for them... I don't know if they are still around though
