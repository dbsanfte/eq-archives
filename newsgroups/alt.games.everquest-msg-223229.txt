If you have alts that can rez each other, summon each others bodies, and 
whatnot else... then you don't have alts you have Dual Accounts.  And 
that you can continue to do on FV.

What you can't do is have multiple characters on a single account.  On 
Morel Thule I have a cleric that can come rez everyone BUT my alt, a 
bard that can come track down quest mobs for my alts, a druid that used 
to be used to port my buddy's alt while her main (a druid) would port MY 
alt...

You also can't self twink very well at all, only way to do it is to get 
one character up in levels, get what you want (cash, a specific drop, 
what have you) and then put the stuff somewhere or on someone else for 
safe keeping, delete and restart with the recipient character.

All that goes out the window if you dual box, of course
