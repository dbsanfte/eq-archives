Ok sorry.. I have to bite :p

Ranger kiting is infinitelly better than a monk. In any situation,
regardless.  10 mins for you to kill a PoF tables mob, I could *NEVER* kill
a tables mob. Give me 20 mins, 40, 60, give me 2 hours, 2 days, I *cannot*
do it!

Firstly try kiting without snare. Not impossible, but 1000% harder

Now try kiting with limited throwing items, doing CONSIDERABLY lesser
damage.

As it happens.. I was actually in HoH alone yesterday, messing around for an
hour (was there to test a new weapon)

Yes I do have ton po pouch, when I needed to back out of the fight I
reverted to throwing shurikens and regenning.. or just trying to kite a mob
for fun (not that it made any difference)

I can hit for 120 or so tops with shuriken. Whats your max hit with a moving
target, 1000?

Anyway on the black guardians in HoH, 1 stack of shurikens is equal to about
1% of the mobs HP.  Believe it or not, I don't have room to carry 100 stacks
of shurikens either.. least of all make 100 per fight

Kiting is about more than just doing more damage. You have snare, root,
nukes, unlimited arrows, accuracy/damage buffs in addition to vastly
superior damage.

So no, monks cannot solo for exp with shurikens. We are not even 1% of a
ranger. I think when he said " They all work on the concept of doing damage
without taking damage, which is what is required to solo grind AAs at 65."
he expected people to factor in your damage has to beat their regen.. least
of all enough of them to eventually kill the mob :D
