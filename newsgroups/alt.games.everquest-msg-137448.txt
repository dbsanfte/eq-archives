If you feel that it is most likely NOT genetic, why not just say so???

I am trying to understand why anyone would take a contrary position
just for the sake of being contrary..

The ONLY reasons I can think of is because:

a- They are a troll

b- They got caught being wrong and in a vain attempt to cover their
ass they say, "I don't really believe that"

So, being contrary just for the sake of being contrary...  Ahhhhh

How do we know??  Maybe you just want to see another debate??  Or
maybe, when confronted with evidence you are wrong, you'll simply
waffle again and say, "Well I didn't really mean I believed that, I
just wanted a debate.."
