COME ON! Everquest is a virtualworld and only a game! It gives u FANTASY!
Great way to relax in your home and good for escaping from the real world
for awhile! I love thoes serious game sessions in the middle of the night
and a cup of hot drink.. I think i can't never stop playing this game!
I only wish my girlfriend would like to play too..
