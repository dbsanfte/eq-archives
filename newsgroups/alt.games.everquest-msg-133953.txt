At lvl 30 druids get specialization. As I understand it, this allows us to
become alot better in one casting discipline? I was thinking of evocation.
Is this accurate? How do you set your selection? Why are there 5
specialization areas to train in when I visit a trainer? I also saw you can
reset all this via a quest in Sol A but it looks like it would cost a few pp
for the ruby so I'd like to get it right first time :)
