Seriously.  I don't see the fundamental methods that players employ to
play the game changing because of that.  They wouldn't take on three
at once, instead they'd do 9 on 1.  To think otherwise is just silly. 
Hell, groups of six can take on three at once these days, and how
often do you see that?

And I'm trying to imagine how silly it would be to see 9 level 55s,
one warrior, 2 monks, 2 rogues, 2 rangers, an enchanter and a cleric,
all melees enchanter hasted in addition to their own item haste,
taking on a frog in Sebilis.  Yes, it's ridiculously overpowered, but
they don't care, because it's still blue experience!  Hell, drop the
cleric and pick up another rogue, who needs healing when the mob drops
in less than 8 seconds?  Hell, bot the enchanter and pick up another
melee.  Don't pick a caster because the mob will be dead before the
caster gets a second spell off, and dots?  Don't be absurd!

Actually, I don't think the group would want rangers.  So dump them
and pick up two more rogues.  Utility classes thrive in smaller
groups, not larger.
