I recommend going with an XP 1700 processor
I like the Gigabyte ZXE motherboard it runs the 266FSB processors with no
problem. The Gigabyte does not have DDR ram support though however I run 768
megs of pc-133 SDram and do not have any problems at all running 2 SEPARATE
copies of EQ at the same time using EQW.
I have a Sound blast Live! Audigy Platinum for sound (which had some slight
configuration problems getting EQW to run properly while running 2 accounts)
I wasn't real happy with the Geforce line of Vid cards so I went with a
Hercules 3D prophet Kyro series 64 meg video
I run a 3com 3c-905c Network card
I do not have a 7200rpm hard drive, I have an 80 gig maxtor drive, but if
you are only going to be using EQ on the secondary system I would strongly
recommend going with a 7200 rpm drive
Cd-roms don't really matter on an eq machine so go with basically whatever
you want.
I have an Enlight 7237 case with a 300watt Sparkle power supply (Sparkle and
Antec power supplies are like the best you can get)
I also run Creative Inspire 5.1 sound setup that really sounds nice for
sound on EQ (or if your like me MP3's instead of the annoying sound of
players running by you)
I'm not sure on pricetag of what I'm running and quite frankly it scares me
to think of how much my EQ addiction has cost me
O and as a final OMG I spend wayyy too much I run a Gateway Destination 36"
monitor that I bought for 500 bucks
Hope this helps sorry for the long post
