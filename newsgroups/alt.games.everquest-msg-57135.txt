Well I have never been "worked up in a rage over it". I would just like to
see the option to prevent some of the "bad" aspects of the experience. Like
I said I love to be inspected at times and other times I do not. I would
just like the option. And so do a lot of other players or this would not be
a heatedly debated topic that keeps reoccurring.

If for no other reason why not just so the players that do go ballistic over
it will stop ranting in here. =)
