No, it would mean no more buying from a level 50 who sat there
for hours with zero risk.   Level-appropriate players would still
sell the items they get if they have better or if they stay long
enough to get multiple drops.

Really?  When I'm bored and just talking in guildchat, I'll sometimes
go to Oasis to help out at the docks.   I'm not there farming anything,
just helping out.   Or sometimes even just go to LoIO and help derail
trains at the windmill.

As has been repeatedly pointed out, high-levels will certainly have
alts (or can get them to the appropriate level quickly) and will
escort those alts through zones looking for the drops.   TLC doesn't
stop that, although it can put at least require some risk for the
twink (some, not a lot.)

Yep.

Role-playing being "I can farm all the really good stuff out of this
zone because I'm 30 levels higher than the highest mob"?   That's
not role-playing.

So do what you expect the newbies to do:  buy it.

People don't enforce the PnP as it regards camps.  "The only reasons
understandable to me are greed and envy" is a perfect description of
why a lot of people see the need for TLC, by the way.

Greed:  I'd rather make 1k pp/hr sitting here farming the ogres in
WK than actually fighting something that might -- god forbid -- be
risky.   The people who could actually get XP off these guys can just
go somewhere else.

Envy:  That damn newbie got the cool, katana-style blade from the
Warrens that I want to run around EC wearing with this outfit.  Damn
him!   I can't get it, but he can.
