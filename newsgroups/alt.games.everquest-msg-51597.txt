Shaman. Not a popular choice lately, but I have no problem soloing BW giants
at level 49 with my shammy. The root/dot/pet strategy works well and if
something goes googoo I can always outrun them with SoW, happens nearly
never though .. it's slow because of the mana regain, though. No idea
how things are beyond 49,  though.
