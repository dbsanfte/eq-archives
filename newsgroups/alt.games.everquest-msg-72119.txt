God you people are so sad, EQ sucks now it dont work on my 486 yadda yadda,
and I now need more than 16meg of ram yadda yadda.

Everyone of you has been moaning that the engine needed to be updated etc
and now it has ya moan about it. Nam any online game that runs in a true 3d
engine supporting the number of textures that EQ does, I don't think you
will find one. Also name a product that is constantly patched, updated etc
etc.

If you dont like it, sod off.... you won't be missed ;)
