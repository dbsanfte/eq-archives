Here are the VMWare networking options (I run VMWare on Linux, so they might
not exactly match the Windows version of VMWare):

1. No networking.  This one should be obvious. :-)

2. Host-only networking.  In this configuration, there is a virtual network
that all your virtual machines and the host are on.  This network is *not*
connected to your real network, unless you set up a router or something like
that on the host.  Not useful if you want to run ShowEQ.

3. Bridged networking.  Each virtual machine's virtual ethernet card appears
to be a real card on your ethernet, complete with its own MAC address.

4. NAT.  Like #2, except VMWare provides a NAT gateway between the virtual
network and the real network.
