Especially in fun and interesting terrain....like in say... Everfrost
Peaks.... or maybe Lavastorm......  Anyone ever run off a mountian, drown in
the ocean, or wade through a lava pit due to LD?

I went LD in EF once while running with SoW on... luckily I ended up on one
of the mountain ridges that didn't have a through way to the other side of
the ridge (I was up against a remote, high altitude  zoneline.)  I was
playing a cleric character...I sat down, medded Divine Aura, then jumped off
to get down safely.  I don't think I would have survived the decent
otherwise.
