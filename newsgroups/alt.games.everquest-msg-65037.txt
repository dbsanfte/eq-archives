I installed SoL, and could only pick 15 enchanched character models
because I have 256mb RAM.  One of the models was horse/elementals.

I haven't seen any difference in appearance with my characters.  I was
wondering if lvl 8 mage pets would have that new spiffy look, mine
does not but I think I'm bugged.  I can't even log in with a Vah Shir;
I get kicked back to the desktop.
