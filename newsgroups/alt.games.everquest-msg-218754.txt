Now, you're halfway there (and not a bad start).  The course from here is to
rank *each* class in *each* category, add up the total rankings and divide
by # of categories.  Then you have a good grasp of the overall balance of
each class.  See, it's great to say that shamans are balanced against
enchanters in damage mitigation, and balanced against clerics in healing,
but on that basis you could give shamans ice comet and it wouldn't change
how you rank them.

Sadly, I don't think Sony gives class balance such thought as even you have,
much less expanding on that concept.
