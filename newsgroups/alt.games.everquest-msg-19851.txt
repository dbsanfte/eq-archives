Of course he does.  The attitude of many parents today is "this kid is 
everybody's responsibility... except mine."  I'm sure you've seen as many 
rants as I have by parents demanding the internet cater to their kids, so 
they can use the TV AND the computer as babysitters without worry.  Hell, 
I've seen 12 year olds *alone* in R rated movies (and what the hell the 
theater is doing letting THAT slide... now I can't watch ANY movies 
without some little creeps running up and down the aisles, throwing 
popcorn, screeching, giggling, whispering, talking to the screen...)

Hellooooooo, offline age-approriate gaming companies/movie rating 
systems...
