OF course you can tell ahead of time.  I can tell you now that the
Aviaks in OOT have high magic resist but not high fire resist, for
example.  I've got a sample group of three, all same characteristics.
If someone was actually compiling such a list they'd shoot for a
sample group of ten, just to be sure...

Yes, there's some luck involved, and yes, they probably have
some variation individually as well... but by and large, I think you
can get a decent handle on whether a mob type is unusually resistant
to a type of magic pretty quickly.

Thing is, we have at our disposal five different lines of magic.  If
we had a general list of relative resists, we could fine tune our
approaches... or avoid things that are resistant to our lines.  This
is part of the strategic game that I think is being overlooked by
and large (there are a few high level mobs where I've seen raid
leaders order full on cold based assault, for example, as that
was the known weakness of the mob target...)
