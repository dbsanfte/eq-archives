Are you seriously saying that you increase your effectiveness 40% by
increasing your mana pool 40%?  That's absurd.

And then you're saying that by giving your caster more mana you've twinked
him BETTER than a melee could be twinked?  That's beyond absurd.

I'm sorry, but our definition of effectiveness differs greatly.  More mana
to a caster is nowhere near the performance increase that haste and regen
are to a melee.  And that's not even counting some of the obscenely good
melee weapons that are trivial to obtain.

You can cast more spells before you have to med longer.  That is all you've
done.  You aren't killing mobs faster.  You aren't killing mobs more
efficiently.
