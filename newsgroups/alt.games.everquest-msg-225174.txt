I love my Warrior...  Seriously, I do.  If I wanted to play a melee with
fancy tricks and extras, I would've played a hybrid.  But my Warrior is
straight foward, and I love it--a nice change from being an Enchanter or
Druid.  Once I have to learn a lot of funky tricks and stuff, it means no
more just going in for mindless slaughter for a few hours, I have yet
another learning curve to keep up with.  ;/

I'm just being picky.  I'll probably like it just fine but right now, I'm
being all codgery and resistant to change.  Because, y'know, I know better
than SOE or something.  :D  (Not!)

(Well... Maybe.)
