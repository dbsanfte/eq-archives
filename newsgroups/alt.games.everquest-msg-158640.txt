Last night in SK, we wound up killing a treant who aggroed on the iksar
monk. An ugly list of faction hits ensued. I'm a 25 dwarf cleric who has
done almost 0 faction work in Antonica, and I'm worried about the new hits.
I've also got a friend with a 52 druid. She's going to help me do the
"nitrates to wk" quest a few times to repair QRG faction. We're both pop
enabled and druid ports are still the quickest, most efficient way to go.

Thank Brell for friendly porting druids!
