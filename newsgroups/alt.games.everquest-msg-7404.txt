I use BlackIce Defender 2.5 here as a firewall. Since i trust verant enough
NOT to hack in my computer, i added all IP ranges from Everquest as trusted
IP's on my firewall. It solved a few connection issues i had when i was
zoning from one zone to another.

Maybe that is what you should do? At everquest.com in the support section is
a page about firewall settings, which list all IP ranges. If you cannot
trust ranges of IP adresses, it also lists the ports that need to be open
for Everquest to work correctly.
