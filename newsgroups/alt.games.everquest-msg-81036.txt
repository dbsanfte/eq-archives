Yeah, yeah, the log splitter isn't strictly neccessary now that the client
will save the logs by character instead of lumping them all together.

But splitting the logs by session results in a really huge number of files,
and it may be neater to organize them by larger time intervals.  So I made
it split the logs up by session, day, week, month, or year.

Monthly works for me, but you can do whatever you want.

You can also feed it existing by-session files, and it will consolidate them
by day, week, month, or year.

You don't have to wait until you have a full month (or whatever) to split. 
If you're not splitting by session, it will append any new data onto the
appropriate file.
