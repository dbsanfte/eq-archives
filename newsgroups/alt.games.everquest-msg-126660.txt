I don't think rain type spells are used much by AE groups tho.  IIRC,
they are kind of an odd bird in that they will hit up to four targets
over the course of their three 'waves', with each hit counting as a
separate target (i.e. a single rooted/stunned target would absorb 3/4
of the spell's maximum damage output).  I doubt an AE duo would work,
so this idea might be a workable option if you didn't have enough
people to make an AE group and couldn't find a decent spot to quad
and/or didn't want to be solo.
