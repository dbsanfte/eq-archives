    Aggro ranges on certain mobs (the Dark Assassins) are very large. From
my time there, I'd say that first-timers would get plenty of adds all night.

    Ideally, you'd have your high-level members go there and group a bit,
then have your lower-level members come in at a later date. To have all of
you wondering what's up is asking for disaster.

    I see a lot of healing, so that's good. But I don't see a slower except
for you, and that's bad. The mobs are pretty high level, and you'd be in for
a lot of beatings trying to get stuff handled.

    Well, if you want to see the INT caster gear available there:

    http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7399

    The drops are lower down the page, hyperlinked. My opinion? Some are OK,
but you could do better. Going to Kael in the arena would get you better
items, and the faction for much better (Skyshrine) when that time comes.
Small-group Halls of Testing raids are very doable with post-60 characters,
so that is something in your future.

    The one class that really cleans up in Umbral Plains is druids. Their
armour drops are fairly plentiful, and of better quality than that
Dreamweaver stuff. But they can solo the mobs that drop it, albeit slowly,
so heading there to gear them up isn't really necessary.

    When you pull out your hair in frustration, does it come out in clumps
or just as strands? ;-)
