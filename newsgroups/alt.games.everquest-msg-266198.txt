I used to come here under a different name.  What it was, I don't even 
remember.  I stopped playing in August of 2003 and for some reason came back 
to this NG to see who's here.  I see some same old names, peeps that were 
here before I was.

This post is not meant to be a rant against people who play this game, just 
wondering *why* you still play this game.  This game is very addicting. 
Will I be someone on TV saying "This game is addicting, don't play it", like 
we've seen before?  No.  Your time is what you make it.  I would love to get 
about 3 hours of free time to say "hi" to some people I met on the game that 
turned out to be some cool people, but I'm glad I gave absolutely everything 
I earned in the game away, keeping me from playing again.
  Anyway, I wish you all the best of luck.  Just give me a reason why you 
still play.  Maybe tell me how long you have been playing this game.

Lastly,  Bizbee...if you are still on here.  You are a complete asshole. 
Die, please.  You would be doing society (real and virtual) a complete 
favor.
