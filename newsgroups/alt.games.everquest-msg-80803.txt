Manastone plus Fungi, then yes I would say its worth it.  Also, you can
still get exp all the way to 56.  Granted, it slows down around 52, but it
is possible never-the-less.

As for the comment of it being a gimmick.  >:)  I have three fungi/manastone
50+ characters that would say otherwise.  It's all about patience (as in any
type of soloing), where you go and whether or not you have that fungi.

Remember too, port and gate/bind affinity are your good friends.
Clarity/Clarity 2, manastone, fungi and celestial healing just plain rocks.
