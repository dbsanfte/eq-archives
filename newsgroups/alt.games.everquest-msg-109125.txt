Yah, thats the one I used to pick up the Chimp. Some are legit sales, some
are scams are they rely purely on the "honesty" of the traders whose actions
openly display their views on legalities and contracts.

Roll the dice and cross your fingers - be prepared to take responsibility
yourself if you get burned. Also - like gambling, do not spend any money you
couldn't afford to throw away without concern.
