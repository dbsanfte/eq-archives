On the plus side, you can plan in advance to do all your leveling in Guk
and Seb and get the bulk of that faction while you actually get exp for
it. Nothing more annoyingly boring than killing endless greens for
faction.

Even then, I'd take the L55 recommendation with a grain of salt. A full
balanced group of 55's could farm reet crowns but most do it at a higher
level because not everyone is going to want to sit around farming low
experience mobs for a toy. The higher you are past 55 the less people
you'll need to find to help farm it.
