You're confusing respect for the property of others with fear of the
law. Perhaps the only reason *you* wouldn't steal the software is a
fear of punishment, but *I* wouldn't steal it because I respect the
effort that the creators put into it, and feel they deserve to be paid
for it.

Kindly supply us with your real world address so that someone can
demonstrate to you how that theory will feel when you're on the other
end of it.

balls for), you'll no doubt be arrested for something, sooner or
later.
