    Dachunker pinged 107 a few days ago. And he has just got himself a bot
cleric, so now he's even more unstoppable.

    No, I'm talking about the nerf to Acrylia Caverns itself to change how
AoE-able it is. Not to any warrior abilities. Dach posted his log to Steel
Warrior, so if you have the time to burrow through that many damage messages
you could see if he'd exploited an instacast or not - if he did he didn't
mention it in group.
