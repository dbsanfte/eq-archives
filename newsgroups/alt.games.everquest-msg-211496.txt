Having played a cleric up to 65, I found ranger tanks to be huge mana
sinks from 20-45 or so. They didn't get much better as tanks at that
point, either. Rather, around the mid-40s, they start grouping with
much better slowers and KEI'd healers.

I also play a ranger (level 32 now) from time to time. Even as twinked
as she has been, she's still a situational tank at best.
