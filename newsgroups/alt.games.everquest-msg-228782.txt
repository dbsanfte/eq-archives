My understanding was that Interplay shut down Black Isle because they were
more interested in developing console games than PC games, and Black Isle
was only producing PC titles.

Most of the best known Black Isle titles were widely considered one of the
best (if not the best) titles in the genre for the year in which it was
released.  I don't see that as sucking.
