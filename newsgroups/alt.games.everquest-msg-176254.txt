When you get to the top of the hate list does more taunting still generate
more hate, or does taunt *only* take you to the top of the hate list and
nothing further?  Because if it does still generate more hate I think that
it would be a good thing to keep taunting so you get a bigger margin of hate
over what the rest of the group has.  But if taunt can only get you to the
top of the hate list and no further, then it would be best to stop so that
the taunt key is ready at a moments notice when it is needed.
