The fact that I found your celebrating the death of a child extremely
offensive (note, I am not referring to your other examples of
Darwinism - adults, in my opinion, are completely on their own when it
comes to avoiding acts of stupidity - which were mildly entertaining)
does not mean I am unfamiliar with what a joke is. I have an excellent
sense of humor. That crap just was *way* far from funny.

Not at all. Again, feel free to check. I only mentioned your crass
comments about a child's death. Your misconceptions (likely
intentional and self-serving) do not, contrary to what you may
believe, help your case. Making jokes about a child's death is
inexcusable.

See? You might get a clue by reading my entire post. I had a strong
objection to a specific point ("joke") you made.

I'm not him. It takes quite a bit to offend me. I just find jokes
about a child dying to be utterly reprehensible.

You don't care about me? *sniff* Whatever shall I do? Also, I'm
guessing the jury is still out regarding your life having any meaning.
I don't attribute *that* much weight to my opinions alone.
