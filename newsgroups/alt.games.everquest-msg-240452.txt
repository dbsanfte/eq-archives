newbie to eq. level 8 wiard. i amd getting killed constantly. there are 
some real assholes out ther (one guy just kept killing me 8 or nine times 
in row - he can't be getting much experience if i'm that easy to kill?). 

i need to buy some expansion thingie to get pok. there appeaars to be 
*no* way to find groups of like alliences in freeport.

i have found a group to play with (twice). that was great fun. but if one 
needs to buy more stuff (i can) only to get into a more complicated game 
with larger worlds when i can't seem to master the basics here seems like 
it would just be more frustrating (but constantly getting killed is 
*really* frustrating).

if i go to another server and roll up a character, will i lose the one i 
have? or will i get him sans equipment and gold in bank?

thanks
