I was merely joining the /ooc conversation that was already there, and
everyone can see it their own way, it's just my opinion, I'm far from a
neo-Nazi and don't plan on joining too many guilds for a while, out of the 3

questions I had such as "what is a quick way to <zone> I was either not
given an answer until I found my way there on my own, or was told to look it
up.
