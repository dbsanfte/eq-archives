	36% item haste will cap you with Shissar or VoG.  Clicky haste items are
only of interest when soloing, since they'll be overwritten by haste spells.

	Sorry, itemization for Rangers is terrible.  There are a handful of
weapons just over the ratio of a Tox Axe (which barely outdamages
Earthcaller); your next stop is Cursed and Emperor.  IV can drop a tasty Light
Woodsman's Blade, but it is ultra rare (less frequent than 1 in 40 kills).
This is why so many Rangers use Archery over melee at Hunter level.  Monks
have many, many more upgrades available to them.

|So far there is
|NOTHING in PoP for monks - no equipment, no weapons, no nothing.

	Somehow I doubt that.
