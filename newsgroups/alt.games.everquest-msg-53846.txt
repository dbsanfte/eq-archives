 No, not feign. Once you feign and wipe the hate list he really goes
into regen mode. I was thinking of just running around with sow while I
regen. While mobs are mad at someone they don't normally regen as fast
as they do when they have a clear hate list.

 I'm not sure on his faction, but you can always kill the lizards
outside Cazic to get +faction with those inside.
