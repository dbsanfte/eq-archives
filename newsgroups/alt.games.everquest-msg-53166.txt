Hmm I never got jumped by Zigg Flin in Freeport, i think i am dubious to
him, but I fought in Steamfont from 8 til 12 or so killing several
minotaurs in the process.  I am still kos to everyone but the evil
guilds in mines of Malfunction with akanon oh and to the gnome and dwarf
members of the fab four in Dagnor's. 
(Actually after decimating the sister population for  two levels, i
would imagine I am also KOS to the elves there now too, but haven't
bothered to go check).
