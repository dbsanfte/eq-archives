I've never had a mail quest that didn't perform exactly as advertised, but I
haven't done nearly all of them. Do grab the notes from Feerrott right next
to the Innothule zone, and Innothule just a bit north of the Feerrott aone,
they are both addressed to the same person :)

I suggest you write down what goes to who, I keep a large notepad right next
to my keyboard at all times...I even check what i've written occasionally :)
