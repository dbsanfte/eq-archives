Worldliness is more than socialization. It is freedom of action.

So far there have been two attempts at worldliness mmorpgs. UO and SB.
SB was a total failure, but it was for a great deal more than because
it was worldly. UO was a smash hit which actually declined when its
worldliness was badly damaged.

The main problem with UO's worldliness was that the consequences for
bad behavior was insufficient (to say the least). The easy way out,
the gamey way out, was to make it impossible (Trammell). There was a
better way out, a worldly way out.

A mmorpg will come eventually that takes that road. All the gamey
mmorpgs are feeling more and more like copies of each other.

I would have called it a rather artful use of prejudicial language,
myself. I should have been a poet. Or a propagandist.

The analogy remains apt, though. In EQ2 you will be warm and cozy in
the comforting, protecting palms of the game design. I think the
rewards are far better if one strikes out into the harsh and
unpredictable world of freedom of action, however... as long as the
consequences are done right.
