Well. That would depend on if your being stupid enough to thing A.I.
has anything to do with Physics. They made the pathing for mobs. (as
screwed up as it is in some places) There isn't any reason that they
can't fix the pathing so mobs have to follow the same rules of physics
as the players do. It has nothing to do with someone running out and
pulling a mob to his/her group. (short of the mob vanishing from spawn
point and poping ontop of the puller 50 yards away.)
