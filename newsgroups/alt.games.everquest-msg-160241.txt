It would try to port you then kick you to safe spot in the zone.  There 
have been rare instances of people being taken to nexus when they don't 
have Luclin, haven't heard of the opposite happening but you never know.

You should get Velious eventually, good place for over 35.  Hubby's 
ranger got some nice velium armor last week, he got lucky and there were 
  3 drops that no one in his group but him could use.   The poor cleric 
in the group really wanted SOMETHING out of the 3 hours we were there 
but he was out of luck.

Good luck
