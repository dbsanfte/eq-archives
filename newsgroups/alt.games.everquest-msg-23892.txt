It's part of the fourth coldain prayer shawl quest.
You can either trigger the quest mob (a dorf that's near dead) or a
kromrif death squad.  The death squad can be 2 to 8 blue to level 60
giants running at near sow speed. 

It's rare but can happen.

If you stick to the main path through Kael, the odds of you seeing the
one wandering see invis giant is about 1 in 1000.  If you diviate from
that path, you will be in for a BIG surprise.  Everything past the
bridge to Tormax throne sees invis and everything past the archway
leading to Kael arena sees invis.

Once out in WL, the two named kromrif giants that is part of the
dragon's bane quest are the only see invis giants there.
