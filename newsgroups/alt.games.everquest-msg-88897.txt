    Yes, they messed with CHeal's aggro after complaints from druids and
shamans about how their lesser heals, chain cast, created much, MUCH more
aggro than a single Complete Heal. Clerics got reamed, people screamed, it
was changed again and now it's hard to tell if there's any difference from
before. This happened the same time as debuffs got their hate value changed,
although they also look like they were changed back.
