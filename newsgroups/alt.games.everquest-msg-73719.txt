essentially the point of doing /assist %T (or whatever the actual command
is) is to target the critter your main assist is targetting.  So if you want
to not keep changing the assist key to the person who is main assist every
new group, /assist Joesmoe, you then have to do two key strokes, first
hitting F2 thru F6 (where-ever main assist is), then hitting the assist key,
to get his target.

Appearantly their is no %F2, although I guess you could ask for it to save
on keystrokes from the programmers.
