As someone who just voted for micheal bandarik, lemme give you a clue lance. 
Machines that just count holes in paper do not give a flying flip who those 
holes represent . Those machines have no way of learning who each hole 
represents and then deciding on which canidate they favor for giving the 
tastiest paper. You do yourself and your party a disservice when you mention 
that bush stole the last election.The machines counted all the votes and 
then counted all the votes again, then some bright person said those 
machines dont know what they are doing we have to count these by hand since 
everyone knows a calculator cant be trusted but that real people are always 
above reproach. It makes you look petty and either easily misled or somewhat 
lacking upstairs. You should also really check the popular vote numbers. The 
last democratic president to actually have a majority of the popular vote 
was president carter with 50.1% .

If your gonna vote against bush at least have good honest reasons. Mine 
where he has very loose fiscal policy, and no respect for the freedom of 
speech that he swore on a bible to uphold along with other rights he is very 
suspect on.

free drugs to seniors (BAD)
campaign finance reform (BAD)
goverment education (bad)
tobacco buy out (BAD)
reform social security (good)
cut taxes (good)
not cut spending (BAD)

war in iraq (dont give a flying flip its his damn job to protect the country 
as well as he can and as he sees fit, all the other stuff he was doing was 
NOT his job)
