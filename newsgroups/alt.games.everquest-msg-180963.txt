I had some guy bitch at my prices. I told him they are my items, I'll
sell them for what i want. I priced low for a quick sale, since I don't

He threatened to undercut me, and I told him he couldn't.

He did, I bought him out and re-listed them all at my original price.

He indicated displeasure....
