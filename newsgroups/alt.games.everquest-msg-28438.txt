I started a monk awhile back, and put everything into STR.  He was fine, but
then I started hitting the monk sites and reading what the more experienced
monks were saying.

So I rerolled him and put everything into STA.  His damage output is, as
far as I've been able to tell, identical, but he has more HP.  More
importantly than that, with his normal gear, he is able to hit that magic
100 STA level, which he couldn't do before.

Good things happen at 100 STA.
