I don't know the details of the quest but I know the biggest bottleneck is
Ragefire (or Ragesomethingelse) which spawns some time after Nagafen is
killed.

On Zeb, the etiquette is, whoever kills Naggy gets Rage, as long as the
spawn is camped the whole time.

To kill Naggy you have to have either a lot of friends, or a dragon-capable
guild behind you.

Also, Ixt-something in Burning Wood is probably tougher than Naggy to kill
(only done Naggy once) so again, friends or strong guild.

A friend on my server (Adirya) did all the hard pieces of her epic without
guild backing so it is possible, but you do have to have lots of friends.
