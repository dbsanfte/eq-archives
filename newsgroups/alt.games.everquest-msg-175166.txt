Depending on the buff, I also usually go with the 'buff the pet first' so
then I know when it goes off..  I do have timers on my desk.. but honestly I
usually use those for when I'm camping things.. 6 minutes is up, here comes
Happ!  Honestly, if I'm in a group who gets upset because they have to ask
for a buff, I'd leave before they asked me too.
