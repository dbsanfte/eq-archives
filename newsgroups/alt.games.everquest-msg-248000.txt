I think time commitments in MMORPGs fall into two groups.

1. To get to a certain level requires a certain amount of time.  City of
Heroes certainly has this.

2. Certain things that you are very likely to want to do, or need to do to
advance, take a large amount of time in one play session.  E.g., there
used to be camps in EQ that were basically essential for certain classes, if
they wanted to get the best equipment, which was necessary to take on the
most challenging mobs for their level.  Some of these camps could require
many hours of waiting, or killing placeholders.

Does City of Heros have any of this second type of time commitment?

It is #2 that is fatal to mass market games.  #1 isn't that bad.  If you
have a group of friends in RL all playing together, they will probably be
able to put about the same time into the game, so will progress roughly
together.  This is an area tradeskills can help with in those games that
have them...if someone is putting in a little more time than his friends, he
can spend more time on tradeskills, and put of XPing except with his
friends, and so they will stick together.  CoH doesn't have tradeskills, so
perhaps that is a weakness.

Another game that appears similar to "There" is Second Life
(www.secondlife.com).

There was a segment on "The Screensavers" on TechTV about the use of games
for military training, and they mentioned that the goverment is using a
special version of "There" for this.  They picked it because its engine can
handle much bigger and more complex worlds than MMORPGs.
