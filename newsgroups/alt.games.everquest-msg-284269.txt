Quillmane can actually spawn in any of at least 20 different places,
probably more.  It can also wander in different directions, much like
the trash do in the karanas.  I was watching track and finding
Quillmane the instant it popped, in many cases right in front of me,
and in other cases I was in sight before it began wandering.  So I
began mapping all of the spawn points until it became clear that the
stupid horse can spawn just about anywhere and wander in just about any
direction.  I was hoping to find some other unique characteristics but
all I could determine was what everyone already knew: 72 seconds and
the trash can be any number of different mobs in the area: Aviaks,
lions, etc...
