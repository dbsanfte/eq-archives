I havent been on EQ for 2 weeks and I have downloaded all drivers,
updates and changes. I have a Gateway comp with a AMD Anthalon
1100Mhzs,Nividia TNT2, SB PCI 128,256RAM, BCM V90 56K. This is what
happens- I log on get to the character select screen and then get the
*You have been disconnected* message and then I am unable to get on
the log in screen as my internet connection has frozen up.I exit the
EQ patcher and try to go on IE and cant due to it freezing up, so I
have to disco the connection and then restart my modem connection. EQ
says its my WIN based modem, I have tryed all the different settings
except the advanced options with a string setting. I cant seem to find
a init string setting for this BCM modem. So, if any one can help me
out I would greatly appreciate it, as I miss playing EQ immensely. Thx
Bob
