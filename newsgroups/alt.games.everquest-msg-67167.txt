I assume you mean Dec 9, 2001?  Yesterday it was $20, not $14, at Best
Buy here.  That's also the price at their web site.  If you saw it for
$14 at Best Buy, it was because that store had decided to do something
special.

Hey, your extra $10 over what I paid got you something I don't get.
You got a long patch process as you competed with a zillion other
people.  I only had a 10 minute patch.  I feel ripped off...the stupid
thing was done and ready to play before the TV show I was watching
ended, totally messing up my Sunday schedule!
