Invis, click on the portal to the tower and you'll still be invis. Con
the lady there. She should be glower dubious like she was for my druid
of tunare ( I think everyone is the same.) 

The faction she and some other people are on at the tower is Vornal
something (the master guy in the tower)  The way you raise it if you
really want to is by killing those elementals on the island. The
elementals only lower faction with themselves and raise it with
vornal.

Some of the people by the zone to katta are on katta factions I think
(possibly katta citizen) and I don't know about the other npcs by and
inn and stuff but the mage people are their own faction (though the
vendor guy there is on a diff one.) I did not think to check if a
guard in the mage tower was on the same faction as them.

Invis, use the port, target some of the npcs and back away. make sure
to target the guard before assuming because you are not kos to the
caster you won't be to any of them.
