Light blues were previously greens but still gave exp, at lower levels this
may not be the case but I can well remember, at lower levels,  seeing 2
messages for green cons one of which would give exp. Later there are or were
2 messages for Blues, again I believe Light Blue covered the lower of these,
at the end (or the mid levels on) tho there was one green, blue, white etc
with only 1 message for each colour, at 50 a high thirties mob would con
blue and a low to mid thirties green but the latter would still give exp and
a hard fight (in melee) the light blue con was to help distinguish mobs like
this.

> Ok, Dark Blue is a level or two below you.

Not sure how the calculation for this works, at 52 a 40th level mob is still
blue.

Black if you use the windowed view and not full screen, used to confuse me
when people talked about "black" cons.

> Yellow means the mob is one (maybe two?) levels higher than you.

Two, this never changes, no matter what level.
