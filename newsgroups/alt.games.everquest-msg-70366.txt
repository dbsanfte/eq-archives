The problem I believe is with Creative Labs, they havent gotten around to
making some good Win2k/XP drivers.

I have a soundblaster live and it was just fine with Win98 but in XP every
so often it will get the popping and cracking, and its the worst when
playing EQ. If its really bothering you (doesnt bother me too much yet, I
have a high tolerance of annoyances) you should sell you soundcard and get a
Turtle Beach Santa Cruz or something from a company other than Creative.
