Actually my very first character was a Human SK in Qeynos. Equipping 
myself wans't really an issue, I've played enough video games to figure 
that out. And scribing spells wasn't an issue at least until the i 
created my first alt, a wiz at 3rd level in freeport, because I had died 
11 times trying to get to a RL friend in Freeport, and lost the vast 
majority of my corpses 'somewhere' in the Karanas, including a couple 
for getting to close to Karanas residents who were KOS and came 
screaming out through the walls of their houses as I approaced to hit me 
for hundreds of damage and instadeath me...before finally making it to 
north Karanas and watching Grimfeather kill the tower gaurds as I ran 
towards them with a lion on my ass.

But the big startup issues for me were not 'equipping myself' but 
finding my guild leader and the way out. I started in Qeynos, I don't 
even recall where anymore... but lets just say the SK guild underneath 
the Arena is not well marked; 'following the bones' or whatever the clue 
was did eventually get me there... eventually.  It was actually quite a 
feeling of accomplishment when i found the secret wall...

But the pisspoor vertex lighting algorithms combined with my newbie 
torch and a TNT video card (iirc) rendered long dark hallways totally 
black...  I had trouble zoning from NQ to SQ at dusk never mind 
wandering aound in the catacombs around the SK/Nec guild.

That said, no i didn't do the tutorial... I bought the game the same day 
as a couple other people, and we figured we'd figure it out together. We 
knew one guy who had it for a couple days, so the simplest interface 
basics were covered but he was an elf and had no idea about being blind, 
or where stuff was... and the complete garbage that Verant shipped for 
maps wasn't helping much.

FWIW I did eventually run the tutorial, months later when the servers 
were down and needed a fix and figured I might actually pick up some 
trick i didnt know, and I was totally disgusted, and in hind sight I'm 
glad I never tried it. Several NPCs that called me by name when I 
'approached', that initiated conversations, and told you relevant 
information, followed by a combat that was survivable... had I played 
the tutorial I would have been right irritated that 90% of the people in 
my guild hall were indifferent and speechless and the moss snake was 
able to devour me whole. The tutorial was written for a different game 
imo, because it wasn't anything like EQ in there.
