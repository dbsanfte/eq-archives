Starting out a necromancer, I generally stuck to bears as my game.  Over the
course of 3 weeks this is how I had made money, this was about 2 or 3 weeks
ago.  For the most part I thought it had remained the same.  I may be wrong.
Other servers have about the same price rance, example Antonious bayle,
Tallon Zek, Vallon, and on Rallos Zek, they just take it hehe ;)
