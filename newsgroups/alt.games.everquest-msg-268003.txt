Actually this is the major area of contention and WHY they do not want to 
persue legal action. There is a very VERY strong argument that virtual items 
have value by the simple fact that they can be sold. If virtual items have 
value then soe was never legally free to nerf or remove items at whim. They 
would be held to a higher legal standard . Much more like a physician who 
gets paid for medical care. They would be required to not act in a negligent 
fashion.

As far as i know this has actually only gone to the courts a few times and 
each time I heard about it the gaming company ended up caving and paying off 
dammages in a settlement instead of it being decided and becomming a full 
precedent .

Incidently it really just does not look good for soe if you examine similiar 
precedents.  Car companies cannot require you to use their repair shops . 
Gas companies are in the courts right now for pricing discrimination by 
location. Employee no competition contracts have been largely struck down. 
They are trying to argue that they are a mall and own all the realestate 
while not being like a car company overcharging for repair work. Very small 
tightrope to walk.
