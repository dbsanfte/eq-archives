CoH allows you to do it two ways.

Sidekicking raises you up to one level below the person you are sidekicked 
to. All of your powers and hitpoints are scaled to that level.

Exemplariung brings the higher level person down to the level of the lower 
person. They lose the use of the powers they gained above that level, but 
they keep all of the enhancements to the powers that they are able to use. 
In addition, when exemplared, any debt you have is worked off at a much 
faster rate. Once all the debt is worked off, the influence (platinum) 
starts rolling in. The farther down you exemplar, the faster the work-off 
of debt/accumulation of influence.
