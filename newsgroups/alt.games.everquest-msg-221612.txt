If you're paying 14 plat per peridot, the best investment you can make
as a cleric is a pair of opal encrusted steins to hold while you buy
and sell.

I keep a stash of 200 peridots and 80 emeralds on me at all times. To
date, my guild has reimbursed me for 644 peridots and and 198
emeralds. I've easily gone through 1,000+ peridots while XPing. The
steins have paid for themselves many times over. And, I'm a latter-day
cleric, having played a necro, then a rogue main to 55 and 65 + 49
respectively before playing this cleric to 65 + 67. I expect to buy
that many peridots many times over.
