dude...

dont b giving me credit!  i forgot THE DAM COMMA in FANG!!!! LoL

(t'was purely accidental)

i love to argue with u vengy... its sooooooo, soooooooo futile !  i used to
get pissy about arguments of futility... but then i saw the light! and it
was EQng where i learned i could pass my own feelings of futility on to the
next poor rat bast!  LoL

If there was a chance that my spelling and syntax could save the world from
its abysmal demise I promise you I would dot every "i" and cross every "t",
alas it is not thus.  I do not see, in any way, shape, or form how spell
check makes someone a genius and us "shorthanders" (what is Matt's favorite
word?) morons.  as if !

online forums r the only place where i allow my english to degrade to
shorthand
just b thankful i dont go off shorthanding in spanish!

i leave the french to u my dear vengy ;)

peaceout, princess
