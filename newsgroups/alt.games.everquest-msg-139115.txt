I set up with, amongst other things, 10 Essence of Sunlight @50pp...

20 minutes later, some guy walks up and buys the lot

"whoopee," I think to myself "500pp for something that was just clogging up
vault space!"

A while later I check /bazaar to see if anyone's underpricing what I have
left, and because I still had 'sunlight' in the search box, decided to check
if I'd got the price correct (seeing as it went so soon after I set up).

Lo and behold... some guy has 10 @175pp... er, hang on... that name's
familiar

Yes, the same guy who bought my EoS is trying to sell them at more than 3
times what they're worth :o)
