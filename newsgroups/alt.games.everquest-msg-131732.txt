Why is it awful?  It'll outdamage the Lammy past L50, so anytime
he doesn't need to work at gaining/holding agro it's superior.  Seems
to me to be a situational call, depending on the mobs he's fighting
and his role in the group/raid.  Best efficiency would probably be
achieved by keeping all three weapons and using Wurmslayer/Lammy or
Lammy/Centi depending on how difficult it is to hold agro when he's
tanking.

Of course, a better solution would be to get a high damage 2hander and
switch between that and the Lammy/Centi combo as appropriate (in which
case your advice to ditch the Wurmslayer makes great sense), but he
didn't mention 2handers in his post.
