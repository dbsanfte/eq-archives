It's not just a regional thing. I go to a Regal cinema in Niagara
Falls, NY, 
and they show "The Twenty" there as well. It's a decent time-killer
while I 
wait for the movie to start, so I think them starting it was a very
good idea.

As for Sony advertising this trailer for EQ2 in theatres, the same 
was done with Warcraft III, so I don't see why they wouldn't do it.
