Thank you.  I would like to point out that I am no more of a proponent of
censorship than anyone else here.  If the government came in and said the
group had to go, I would strongly oppose the order.  None the less, when it
comes to open markets like an ISP, I <Patrick Stewart voice> can certainly
uuuurge* </Patrick Stewart voice> them to not carry that forum.  It's a
market place of ideas, if they can't find a hold for their idea, than it has
failed in the market.  At the same time, I can understand if Cox doesn't
want to restrain any speech on their end.  I don't have to agree with it,
and I don't have to stay with them.

What I find to be almost frightening is the response to the mere suggestion
that I was going to try to seek a peaceful solution with those responsible.
I can't quite describe why that fact is so disturbing, though....
