I saw someone last night asking for a port from West Karana to North
Karana because he was at the Qeynos Hill line and his corpse was in
North Karana. I didn't really have much sympathy for him at that time as
my corpse was currently at the Qeynos Hill line and I was running all
the way from the Gypsy Camp in North Karana. And this was after already
doing at least 3 corpse runs yesterday from South Qeynos to the eastern
edge of West Karana. Man, is West Karana a big zone!

It's something from which it's so hard to be free.
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page.
