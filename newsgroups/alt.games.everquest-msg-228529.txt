That might happen if there was a point to staying alive.  However, consider
that all it takes is an Enchanter going LD at the wrong time in your XP
group for the whole group to be sent back to level 1.  Given that, I think
people for the most part won't even try to level.  Some level, N, will
emerge (probably class-dependent) that people will shoot for, where N is
relatively easy to reach so it doesn't take too long, but powerful enough
that you've got some interesting stuff to do in PvP.  People will level up
to around N, and then go out and PvP until they die.
