LOL, how you could expect much from a level 12 enchanter is beyond me or 
how you could really need it anyway. I would think such experiences 
would be funny but then I try not to take the game too seriously, even 
though I am sincere in trying to play my own class well.

Well, naturally when the Warrior gets higher he is going to need to give 
up soloing or get to like sitting and bandaging isn't he? Which again is 
all the more reason that his having enjoyed buffs at low levels isn't of 
much consequence. How many warriors do you know who are soloing in their 
60s? I have never met one myself. Somewhere along the way this little 
party will end and the natural way of things will take over. I remain 
confident that by the time he's in his 40's and temp becomes appropriate 
to have anyway, his soloing with it at lower levels with not have 
affected him in learning to be a capable warrior. It will just have 
allowed him to have a little more fun with a little less downtime.

And correct me if I am wrong here but do you really think having temp is 
going to insulate a chanter who does not know how to play from death 
early on, say in their 30's playing LDoNs? I know as a cleric how fast 
casters bite the dust even with Virtue on. A lot of times once they get 
aggro its hopeless and I can't cast fast enough to keep them alive, even 
with quick heals or group heals depending on what the situation demands. 
I take pride in saving them as often as I can but basically, buffs do 
little to keep casters alive in my experience. Knowing how to play their 
class does. And with that in mind I would maintain that they are going 
to have to learn to play their class, temp or not if they want to live. 
They'll figure this out quickly enough in most cases I think. Don't you?
