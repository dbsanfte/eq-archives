It increases your strength, but at the same time it directly decreases your
attack (and armor class) in an even greater amount.

Drunk, you are much worse fighter than sober.

The only real use for it is fun and color, a bit of atmosphere.

And while it is fun to drink to your max and then race across the treetops
of Kelethin at top speed, (or at least it was before the elves decided they
wanted to kill me...) the "drunk effects", slurred speech, swaying, etc,
generally last long past the fun and into irritation, and turn the entire
thing into more trouble than it's worth.
