This was happening to my cleric in OT the other day with sarnak braids (im a
de). I got sick of trying to get my fair share so i just disbanded. Next
thing they are all begging me to come back, so I do so but let them know I
want my share of braids. Didnt get another braid after that. As soon as i
missed on my turn I just disbanded again, and stayed disbanded from that
party. I guess I can pick and choose as a cleric in OT tho. I think as a
wizzy you would just stay ungrouped that way.
Form the group yourself, and just kick out anyone who doesnt respect loot
order. voila.
Another option is to solo, or for a 2 or 3 person group. Smaller groups
usually=friendly groups in my experience.
