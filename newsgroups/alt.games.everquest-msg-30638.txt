    He was at one bub of life when Turgur stuck. He had to Cannibalize for
mana constantly in the fight. Tell me how he was going to stay alive once
Turgur stuck, with him at one bub and the dragon STILL doubling for 250
(just slower), AND regain needed mana without Torpor.

    Agreed on Turgur. I didn't read enough to be certain, but it SOUNDS like
he had a "lock" on the dragon: it couldn't kill him while he was Torpored
and it was Turgured, and he could get back all the mana he needed to
maintain both for as long as required. If that was the case, then Dog Dog
and potions ALONE could have done it if they did damage faster than the
dragon regenerated, and adds weren't a concern.
