True. And besides, the PvP adds a real level of interest, puts a charge in
the whole thing.

However Sony could and should at least do something about train-griefers in
the newbie zones. For example a few assholes are taking sadistic pleasure in
training the drowned citizens out of the West Freeport tunnel into the
newbie area, they are red to all the players trying to do their first few
levels in there.

On such a server, Sony could simply identify and eliminate the few mobs in
each newbie zone that are red to players under level 6.
