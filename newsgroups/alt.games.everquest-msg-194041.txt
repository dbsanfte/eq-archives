Aye, there is..but for some reason I could never find a seller. :( Spent
several months in auction doing WTB.  Got lots of "oh, I sold that
yesterday", and "oh, I have one of those, won't sell though".  We weren't
in a crowd capable of doing the ring to get one, either.

Now fungis...even at 80k apiece they seem to always be available.
