I never wait to slow in LDoN, if that means I get smacked some, so be it, I 
have Torpor.  There is nothing I hate more than a warrior that insists on 
taunting a mezzed mob in LDoN, last mission I did we failed, the warrior 
insisted on taunting each mezzed mob 3 times before breaking mez.  If the 
enchanter gets smacked a couple times by a slowed (I slow them while they 
are mezzed) mob, oh well, Torpor works great on Enchanters too.  Needless 
to say, that is one warrior I will not be doing LDoN with ever again.
