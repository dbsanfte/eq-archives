There, there...
I was mucking around with my level 10 warrior in WC last night, when a
level 45 unguilded dwarf warrior started shouting over and over for a
port to GD. Now, the 10th ring war was in progress, I'd just dropped
off someone for the battle after getting my Sebilis key (yay!), so I
told the guy that going to GD would be a bad idea... I then had to
explain exactly what the ring war was, and explain why he would just
be some extra lag and an extra corpse if he went near it (and I
thought it was bad when a level 43 wanted me to buff him so he could
play with the dark elf reaver I spawned in Kithicor the other night).
He kept whining about wanting to go to Thurgadin for 'quest armor',
even after I explained that every dwarf would die if the war failed.
He liked the idea of a city full of corpses, so I had to explain that
they were unlootable. I then asked if he even had armor pieces for the
quest, which confused him. Turned out the Thurgadin armor he had in
mind was Royal frosted, and he couldn't get into his thick skull that
while the war was in progress outside, he would not be able to get in
and it was bloody unlikely anyone would be killing stuff in Icewell
for him to mooch armor from!
He also asked me for a port, at which point I had to point out I was
also a warrior... why tell him I have a 52 druid? >:) He's safely
noted on my dimwit list now.
