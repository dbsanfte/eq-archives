So there I was in Kanors Castle on the weekend just camping the main
entrance area (I'm only a 42 cleric).  Our group is ok, ranging from a 42 to
50 and doing alright for a few hours.

Anyhow, this level 60 wizard pops in named Goornit or something and starts
talking how he is going to kill the main boss of the keep (I forget the guys
name).  He is at the zone trying to recruit a few other people to go along
with him and /shout(ing) Who isn't a pussy!!   etc. etc.

Anyhow, our tank pulls one Drol guardian and we start fighting... wizard
runs on ahead a bit.  Next thing I see is the lvl 60 wizard with 3 Drol dogs
kicking his ass, I tried to heal the idiot but he was obliterated in
seconds.  I had to laugh pretty hard, who is the pussy now -- and what
chance would he have had against the main dude of the lair if 3 of the
entrance guards whoop his ass (and hard!).

Oh, hahaha - that was a good one.

Cheers!
