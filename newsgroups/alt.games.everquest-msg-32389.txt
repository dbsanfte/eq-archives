You will not evade me, ryouseika <haha@ha.ha>:

Young dark elves are quite unstylish, you know... but I guess I can
let you marry my level 1 DE enchantress spellbuying mule if you
insist. (A friend has a non-agnostic enchanter)

Naked statues? I haven't looked too closely...

Damn right you should be sorry. Don't make me send my shadow knight
after you with her whip...

Roleplaying is fun, I like doing a spot of it from time to time. Of
course, I had to turn down a friend who once wanted my druid to join
the evil roleplaying guild he is in...

>a) there are still beggars EVERYWHERE

2 nights ago, I finally experienced the phenomenon of Rivervale
Begging. I've never been bothered before, but that night I had 3
halflings begging for stuff while I was standing around the bank and
talking with a friend.

>b) I'm REALLY going to have to practice not 'giggling' when I'm playing a 
>male character.  I'm starting to get odd looks :D

Last night, my gender was clarified in a conversation with a friend
and he said he never would have labeled me a female even though I play
one. I guess it doesn't help being one of the more common gender
crossover class/races even if I don't have the stereotypical blonde
face guys seem to like on their wood elf ladies. I know a blonde
female wood elf druid, acts very feminine with hugging people and
stuff, was married to another friend of mine just for laughs - and
it's a guy IRL, who happens to be very good at playing his female
character as a female character.

Armor = good twinking. Bazooka = bad twinking. I gave my melees pretty
good armor but avoided the really high damage weapons when I twinked
them; they'd never get skill raises if they went around killing stuff
in one blow. I can buy them weapons later when they really need them.
