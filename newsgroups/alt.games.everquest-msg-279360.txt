	So you're suggesting that raiders put themselves through hell to get 
upgrades but single-groupers do not? What are you suggesting?

	Is that "anyone up for a DoN" or "anyone up for 6 creators in a row?"

	I'm certain I will at some point.

	I think it is a serious design flaw that people can do the same mission 
over and over and attain more benefit than doing other missions.

	I would prefer to play a game that rewards imagination.

	You have a peculiar argument style - which seems to be essentially 
ignore whatever I say and claim I agree with you. I don't. I actually 
think your model illustrates that the single-grouper capable of taking 
on RSS is a myth better than anything I could do.

	KT is really only viable by single groupers two expansions after it 
came out, with five extra levels and omens/DoN gear. I do recall people 
at 65 with no raid gear having limited success there, but nobody who 
could put up with the constant deaths long enough to get very far.

	Ikkinz... you have got to be joking. Ditto MPG single group trials. 
Maybe once I've done my 60 DoNs, it might be theoretically possible to 
tank in these places with two healers, but I've yet to meet a pickup 
group willing to put up with a tank that needs two healers.

	For this to be even faintly viable you're talking about two things:

	1) Significantly more time investment than raiders put in, for worse gear
	2) A hardcore group of single-groupers who play regularly enough to 
raid but for whatever reason don't.

	I used to be part of (2) (we were insanely hardcore but a bunch of 
Australians on our own on a very American server, in a guild that could 
field 30 people on a raid. We never got far past TT). But I've yet to 
see such a group of insane single-groupers outside a raiding guild. Not 
before and not since. If anyone on this newsgroup is part of or knows 
such a group, that has serious and realistic expectations of taking on 
Ikkinz and MPG trials, please speak up.

	Yeah... insane grinding. Like wipe wipe kill wipe wipe kill.

	I think you can say at this stage of the game that for what we're 
talking about here "raider" means someone who can get elemental drops at 
least. Not much point, for the purposes of this discussion, in classing 
someone as a 'raider' if they're stuck in Luclin getting sub DoN gear or 
DoNish gear.
