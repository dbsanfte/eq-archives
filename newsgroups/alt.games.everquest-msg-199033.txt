The point I was trying to make is that I don't have a whole lot of
sympathy for the people that advertise 'for donations' then bitch
about the fact that some idiot didn't donate enough to live up to
their standards. They always seemed quite willing to take more than
the standard donation without batting an eye so 'for donations' tends
to equate to give me the going rate or more. 

Eiither set a price up front or just accept what people donate and
quit whining about it..

Hmm, I think my record for a port was 400p. Logged on in FV and got a
tell from a friend in an uberguild that they were clearing fear and if
I could get there right now I'd have a good shot at a tear for my
shaman epic. Started auctioning at 100p for a port and went up quickly
from there till I got a druid's attention <g>. It ended up being a
wasted trip but worth a shot nevertheless. 

I never minded paying well for a port because it didn't happen very
often. Unless there was a boat trip involved, I wouldn't bother anyway
and even then I have enough friends with druid alts that I'd rarely
had to bug a stranger. Odds are that if they were on and I needed a
port, I was heading over to group with them anyway. 

My record for a rez was 1k, after a particularly spectacular screwup
soloing deep in SG that involved following a siren around to god knows
where before charm broke. But that included the price of a coffin to
summon my corpse and an essence emerald for the necro rez. 

Rgds, Frank
