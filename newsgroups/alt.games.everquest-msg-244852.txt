I had 2 similar instances this morning. 1st one: in PoK by the main bank, a
DE mage was standing there, then when she sat down to med, she sank all the
way into the ground with only her name and guild tag showing.
2nd one:  Killing IG's in Everfrost, one of the front IG's spawned and sank
into the ground with just his head and shoulders showing. I nuked him and he
ran toward me like this. Being a hafling, it was funny looking at a IG in
the face while fighting him. He was hard to fight, I kept getting the
"target to far" message.
