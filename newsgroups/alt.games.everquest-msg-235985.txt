To get the free month you need a credit card of some kind, since they verify
that they could bill you past the month. The other option is to get a game
card, but they you paid for 3 more months and if you don't like it you are
hosed. I would go to your bank and get a pre-paid visa card (most malls and
banks sell them) and use that to try it, you can always cancel and use the
money on the visa anywhere visa works.
