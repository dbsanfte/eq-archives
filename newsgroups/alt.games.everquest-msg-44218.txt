I haven't heard about AMD's serial number, but Intel's, as I said, is disabled
by default.  In other words, you can't get it out.  So MS couldn't (and
wouldn't) use that as some sort of super secret track you down code.

And MS would have to know *every single method* in order to make use of them.
Too big of a headache for something that would ultimately be pretty useless
anyway.

Umm... so what do they do for PC's that don't have network cards?  Do they not
generate a hash key from that?  Oh right, you're not talking about reality.
Jeez, listen to yourself for a minute.

Which would be pretty damn amazing since, on my PC (and most others), the OS
cannot get the CPU serial ID.

Anyway, I would like to take this moment to thank Sang for settling some of my
fears about the XP activation process.  I wonder how long before somebody
cracks it.  Or have they already? :)
