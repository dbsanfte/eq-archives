Sony will nerf any tradeskill that you can turn in a profit from (by selling
to vendors), so if someone knows a way, they arnt going to say so here. Good
luck finding one. Until recently silvered picks were a way to make money,
but they nerfed the sale price of these.

I think to make real money out of tradeskills, you need to be in POP and
making up things like ceramic shields, bloodmetal earings etc etc. to sel to
other players.

For low lvl people theres relatively good money to be made from farming the
components for others tradeskills. low/medium/high quality cat/wolf pelts,
silks (spider and spiderling and crystalline), swirling shadows all sell
well in bazaar
