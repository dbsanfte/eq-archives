Read the faqs, especially on the message boards.

The head trade skill guy at the fan faire once again reiterated that
NO STAT affects your success chances but ONLY your skill in the trade.
There is ALWAYS a 5 percent chance you will fail for sure.

Dexterity is only verified to be a secondary stat for tailoring as far
as I know. Even with tailoring it has NOTHING to do with how often you
create items.

ALL STATS which help in tradeskills, be they the higher of wis or int,
str for smithing, dex for tailoring, ONLY help in the chance to raise
skills while making trade items.
