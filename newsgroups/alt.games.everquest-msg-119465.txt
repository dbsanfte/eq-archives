What mobs? I have feigned thos same cyclops in RM many times. I think
it was just a bug.

I have feigned off many mobs that should be able to see through FD if any
should, including dragons and some pretty high level leader and guild master
type mobs. I haven't tried to FD off a god yet and I assumed that they might
be the only mobs that can see through FD if any can but I have never seen any
info on it either way.

Hmm. Bard songs. I think thay may be the problem here. What other songs
were you playing? I have had trouble FDing with different bard songs on me.
