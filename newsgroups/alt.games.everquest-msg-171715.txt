It's a pity that some precious space was wasted on a non-Mercedes-Benz posting.

I put in my two-cents worth:

The Gregorian calendar is just one (solar-based) measurement for keeping
tracking of time.  There are plenty of other calendars (Chinese lunar, Arabic
lunar, Judiac lunar-solar, Mayan, Aztec, ect.).  What we call 1 Jan. in the
Gregorian is just another day, relatively insignificant at that, in all the
other calendars.  Besides that, the calendar the Romans used, the Julian
calendar, was completely abandoned in the 16th century, and the Western
Europeans adopted the Gregorian, losing 10 days in that process.  So God wasn't
even decent enough to make us a perfect calendar.

The scientific approach is to name the day with just a serial number:  1 Jan
2003 happens to be 2,452,641 Julian Day (begins at 12 noon GMT).  Whoopee!  Now
go ahead and celebrate that number, would you?

Now if I can just get this guy to tell me how to fix my Mercedez-Benz
odometer...
