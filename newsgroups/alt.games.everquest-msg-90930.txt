The "user friendly" solution would be for the EQ game itself to
inform you when patches are occuring.  Maybe even include an ETA.

A few extra mouse clicks to check the web won't hurt much, but
then again, making EQ more user friendly re: patches wouldn't
hurt, either.  And, apparently, reduce some customer frustration.
