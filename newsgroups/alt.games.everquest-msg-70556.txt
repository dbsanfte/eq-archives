Went down to LGuk Frenzy for some xp-grinding with an Assassin friend.  We
grabbed an LFG when a 3rd person went LD and never came back.  I won the
roll on the first Sash to drop (Lore, so my friend is holding it till I sell
my old one).  Next Frenzied dropped another Sash (I hear 2 in a row is rare)
and we gave that to the LFG necro we'd just picked up.

Easily the most valuable roll I've won yet.
