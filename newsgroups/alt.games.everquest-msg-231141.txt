Some say SOE will run EQ1 as long as it is a profitable division of 
SOE... in a perfect world that would be true... in the real world SOE 
will run EQ1 as long as its more profitable to do that then it is to 
pull the plug on EQ1 and catch as many fish as they can with some 
particularly juicy bait in the EQ2 net...

Its about profit margins, not gross profit.
