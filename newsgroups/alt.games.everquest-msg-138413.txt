For some strange reason my newsreader is not letting me reply to your 
later post...

I'm not going to dig up a cite, but I clearly remember one of Verant's 
spokespeople, don't know if it was Absor or Gordon discussing this, and 
it's supposed to be intentional. I've never been hunting with four pets, 
so I don't know if it's working as intended, though.

Just out of curiosity... What exactly makes you so angry and hostile 
regarding this issue? The OP did come across as a bit of a moron, I'll 
give you that, but appears that the concept itself of a limit in the 
number of pets that can engage a mob offends you...
