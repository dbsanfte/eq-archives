There are probably zillions of those trial accounts floating about, so it is
not that unreasonable for him to ask if anyone has a spare they can give him
to try the game.  I recently checked my Yahoo mail account, which I don't
check often because it is mostly only used for places where I *have* to give
an email address and don't trust giving out my real addresses, and found
that I had *three* of the free trial accounts.

This is odd for three reasons:

1. I have two EQ accounts, so I would have expected at most two of the free
trial accounts.

2. I thought the free trial accounts were only given to people who had
signed up for some newsletter.

3. I'm pretty sure I used my real email address on all my EQ accounts and my
Station accounts.  I have no idea where they got my Yahoo address.
