<snip discussion of four-way stopsigns>

There's actually a logical reason for this rule, and it might help to serve
as a mnemonic device if you or Remington are having trouble remembering who
goes first. Consider the usual U.S. layout of a four-way stop, with two
2-lane roads (that is, roads with one lane for each direction) intersecting
each other perpendicularly. Imagine that you're traveling North and you
approach the stop sign at the same time that a guy on your left, who is
traveling East, arrives. If you have to wait for him before you can cross,
he will have to travel across two lanes of traffic before you can proceed,
because he has to cross over both the South lane and your North lane. If you
go first, then you only have to cross one lane of traffic (his East
direction) before it's clear for him to proceed.
