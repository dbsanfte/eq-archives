hmmm... Way better?   Sure Beasts can tank better, but they CANNOT
buff better, nor Spell damage better.   Shammy's have Group Fo7.  In
most circles if shammy is in group with a beast, the beast is
relegated to just casting Beast Crack.  

Group IoS will be a benefit for when there is not a shammy available
to cast their better buff.  Well better is relative,  as I understand
a few caster classes prefer the IoS line because it stacks with one of
their self buff spells. 

Way Better... not a chance.   Better at what they do.. sure..  but
Shammys are better at what they do.
