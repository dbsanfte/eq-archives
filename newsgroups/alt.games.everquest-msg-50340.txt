I offered to port a red player yesterday (actually his name was more pink to
me but I didn't think I should tell him that) Of course I can't do this as I
am not a PK'r. He kept saying something about a disguise (didn't have a clue
what he was talking about) is there any way I can port a PK'r? Would Camo or
Wolf form have solved the problem? I didn't go back to try again, his
attitude seemed to be that I HAD to help him...so I didn't.
Just wondered, in case the situation ever arises again.

DAoC arrived, gave my copy to a friend who was without (bad credit) and had
itching for it's release. Must say it looks fantastic and makes EQ look very
old and long in the tooth. Still haven't reordered a copy of it myself tho
so I wasn't that blown away (dare say I will, eventually) Shame SoL seems
such a long way off.

Oh, DING 50, finally. Only took 61 days of playing. Who said the casual
player can't get on in EQ ;ï¿½) Only made the last 3 so fast due to twin
accounts and PC's, no more waiting for pick up groups.

Can't say the servers have seemed any emptier so DAoC hasn't gained many
players from EQ, by the looks of things. A few people selling everything off
and hear about whole guilds moving over but that I haven't seen and zone
counts seem that much lower than normal, anyone else notice a drop?

So nice to finally see my sword proc.
