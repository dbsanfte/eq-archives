LOL!! Now THAT is funny.

>It's usenet, don't take things so personal. 

I take everything personally when it's said to me. I'm sorta funny
like that. ;-)

And mind you, how should I not take it personal when someone calls me
stupid or an idiot?

If you mean don't let it get to me, I'm not. I'm having a wonderful
day. I read the group, responded, went to the store, came home, read
the group again and posted again. It's not like I'm off crying about
this crap.

What I do find it incredibly ironic is that when I first started
playing EQ I was absolutely *amazed* at how nice the other players
were. I'm use to Battlenet with D2 cheaters whinging that their dupes
were deleted. Then I start playing EQ and I get hit with driveby
buffings, people taking my lowly character shopping and spending over
100pp on me (AND I don't know them at all!!) and others just dumping
cash on me. I'd ask for directions and someone would come along and
lead me there!!! DAMN!! Talk about wonderful people! I was in shock.

Now the irony, compare that to posting a message in here, out of
frustration because I got dropped from EQ, in the middle of a fight no
less, can't log in even after rebooting my computer. Can't get to the
website to see if it's a patch or something, but every other website I
can get to as well as newsgroups and email. Gee, seems only EQ/Sony is
down. Damn, wonder if they were attacked or something. Bet the people
in the newsgroup would know. Log in, ask a question and get called
everything but a child of god.

This is one of the more hostile groups I've ever read. Do you people
not want new posters unless they 100% agree with you and already know
everything about EQ/Sony there is to know? If so, fine by me. Would be
nice though if you put a warning on the door or something.
