}Has anyone figured out how to change the colors of the text in the Combat Text Display
}Options? All I can get is white (default)

I don't remember exactly which one it is, but it is tied to one of the 
colors from the /usercolor command.  I long ago set 'mob hits me' and 'I 
hit mob' to be two slightly different reddish colors, and this has carried 
over nicely to the new windows.

Oh.  Rereading what you said, perhaps you aren't talking about the new 
/hitsmode stuff.  Then just be assured that /usercolor will work, 
eventually. :)
