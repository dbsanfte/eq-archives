I'll troll a little, hell why not.

I agree with the person who said stay away from EQ in its current state now
(especially with the SOL slop release, Verant needs lessons from Mythic on
how to release patches correctly). I will not say what game sucks and what
rules as it is strictly opinion based. But (there always is one) UO was the
best (for it's time), period (big Ultima fan here). I think level based
games on the internet blow compared to skill based games (UO). Played UO in
beta, loved it. Played EQ in beta & thought it was ok but stuck mainly to UO
at the time. Got EQ at release and still played UO for a month or so. Sold
UO (after doing everything I could I had no reason to keep playing). Went
EQ, by the time I got to level 50 (pre-kunark) I was already getting bored
and felt that the game was more like a job then a game. Plain raids are not
all that it's cracked up to be, in fact they can be very tedious and time
consuming with ppl/groups arguing ALOT. Egos flew out the freakin' door.
Call it LevelQuest, ItemQuest, BubbleQuest add nausea. Funny, UO never felt
like a job ever. Thought Kunark was ok, got to the mid 50's and got really
bored again. I play for fun, not wealth/power/uber-gear. Got Velious, it
blew pretty much. In the mean time I played AC for a year, while I never got
that high I thought it was an "interesting" game but it never caught on
fully. AO was a dog from get go. Went DaoC, was amazed, got in the mid level
range and am now bored pretty much. It's the damn level based games, sure I
played D&D when it first came out (old book & box set to tactical warfare
ring bound books from the beginning of TSR) to AD&D (loved Monster
Manual/Players Handbook/Dungeon Masters Guide (hi Rivers Cuomo of Weezer))
but got tired of the restrictions of them and switched to games like
Runequest  & Melee/Wizardry series and similar non level based RPG's with
far better rulesets. I was very disapointed when then cancelled UO2. One day
someone will take what made UO so spectacular and release a new MMPRPG non
level based. I'm betting on Lord British's game he is developing ATM. Also
too bad Middle-Earth was scrapped too. Until then we suffer with sub-par
games such as EQ, AC and DaoC...

"opinions are like assholes, everyone's got one..."
Holiday cheers!

I highly disagree with the above statement about EQ. I found it the
opposite...levels 20-40 are the most fun. Post 50 is a chore... 1-19 is just
going through puberty.
