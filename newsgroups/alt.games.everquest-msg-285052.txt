Chardok B (The Halls of Betrayal) may be an option, but there are some 
hurdles.  You have to go through Chardok and you're probably KoS there, but 
if you know where the Chardok B entrance is, you should have no problem 
surviving the run.

Once in Chardok B, all of the entrance mobs are undead, but most are green 
at 70 - there are also 6 wandering ghosts that are mostly light blue.  Deep 
inside the castle though, is a backyard cave area full of light blue static 
undead.  There are also 6 more wandering ghosts deep in that are all light 
blue.  To get there though, you have to fight through a lot of live sarnaks 
and also worry about ghosts adding.  Forgot about invising or ITUing 
through, there are too many wanderers and see-through invis mobs.  I two-box 
there sometimes with a bazaar-equipped 70 pal/druid combo.

None of the mobs, live or undead, run at low health, so that's pally heaven 
right there.  Agro range is small so it's usually easy to get single pulls. 
Pacify works most of the time near the entrance, not at all further in.  The 
mobs have very low hitpoints compared to other zones.  I estimate 14-15k hp 
on the toughest non-named.  Max hits are also pretty weak, 250 max on the 
toughest non-named, 370 on the names.  None of the mobs cast spells (except 
the boss, Korocust).  None of the mobs enrage.  Oh, there are also a few 
single mob-spawning traps sprinkled throughout the zone - these aren't 
usually a problem.

There are several named mobs throughout the zone that drop nice tribute 
items - and a couple of the items still sell well in the bazaar.  There's a 
31% haste mask, a see invis earring, and +2 mana regen necklace.  The named 
mobs also drop level 60 spells that sell well, such as Divine Intervention. 
Only the named mobs summon.
