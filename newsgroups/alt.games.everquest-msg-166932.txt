No, have had enough of Verant's system mis-management and I can't
really justify my giving them my hard earned for another game.

Besides, I am no fan of the Lucas pantomime and to be in a part of
some franchised experience is not my thing.   The only franchise I
would run to is if someone did a wonderful Gloranthia.
