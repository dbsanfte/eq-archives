/agree 
This works at times.  I had a magician and got to level 4 asked another
magician in the zone who was in their teens which pet I should buy, as i
only had enough money for one.  They came over inspected me gave me 15
pp and told me buy all of them, and money left over for malachite.  I am
much more apt to help someone like this than someone spamming the zone
for spare equipment or platinum.  Like Platinum ever really becomes
spare.  As you level up the price of the new toys for auction in EC goes
up about 20 times as fast as you level heheh.
