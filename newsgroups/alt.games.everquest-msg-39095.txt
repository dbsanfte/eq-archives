    It sounds like a very nice game. However, FoH, Da'Kor, Conquest,
Afterlife, and other EQ guilds have been extensively involved in the beta,
and it looks like they'll "play to rule" using Beta knowledge in DAoC. Given
that there's PvP in this game of the non-consensual variety, I'm giving it a
pass.
