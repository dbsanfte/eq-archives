Shrug.. done mobs with 12 clerics, also done mobs with 2 people each botting
2 clerics, to form the rotation.  Believe me im well used to making do with
far less resources than is comfortable, I struggled with it for years

Gee THANKS FOR THE INTRODUCTION TO RAIDING!

We killed offossa (enlightened) last night, maybe 5 casualties.  He died
very fast and efficiently.
If i compare that to past runs that weren't so smooth, where group heals
weren't forthcoming, where DPS went splat early on, guess what, it turned
into a total mess..

I know full well the importance of an MA (controlled agro), but DPS (to kill
the mob before he kills you...) is equally vital.

Else why not just raid with 6 clerics, a shaman, and a warrior, James?
