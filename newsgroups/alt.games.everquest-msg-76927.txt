I think this is emergency work, I was in EC on Fennin Ro and everything was
floating in the are, the same around the bank in FP.  I suspect they have a
problem, but like you did not get the full patch message or a sever now
going down message either. Everlore and the Sony board still has all servers
listed as up but I suspect that needs updating.
