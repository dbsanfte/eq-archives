Only attack to let finish hit is spells. If you see X begins to cast a
spell. Let it hit then feign.
I doubt a monk at 27 would not have figured out to turn attack off first but
just in case check that.
Bards have done funny things with my rogue sneak hide that I think is fixed.
Haven't grouped my monk with a bard but songs can be weird.

Try ungrouped out of range FD.
Is MOB red to monk ? Perhaps feign succeeds but Mob too red to notice ?
Never seen that happen myself but ...?
