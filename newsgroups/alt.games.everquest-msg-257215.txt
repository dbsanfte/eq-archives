Sounds great. And I'd love to do just that. But haven't you argued with
(stupid) people who insists that they follow you? ;)
I even explained this a lot and in the end they say: 'Ah ok, but move
on. I follow'. Grrr.
However I do suspect these guys are lazy. Just running to some place
isn't very entertaining so they give this job to the bard. He plays the
speed song so he can lead. *sigh*
After argueing countless times against this I just comply. At least with
the lvl49 selo's they run at full speed for over a minute after loosing
me. So no big deal.
Still I think this AA to be pointless. It would be one of the last I
would intend to get. About the same priority as wisdom I'd say. ;)
