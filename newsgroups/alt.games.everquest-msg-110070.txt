Diablo and Baldur's Gate are limited RPG's.  You play them long enough, you
will have discovered everything in it.  You also start playing them with the
knowledge that you may have to start over with the next sequel.  With EQ,
it's supposed to be a dynamic world, constanly changing, adding new zones /
items / spells etc. to reward those players that have put so much time into
it.  Because of those players that have stuck with it and played, EQ is a
success.  Now Sony / Verants wants to reward those players by possibly
taking away everything they have earned and worked work and forcing them to
start over.  If they do this, I will not be playing EQ2.

Based on your argument, people shouldn't have started playing EQ1 if they
were not ready to move to EQ2.  So therefore, I shouldn't play EQ2 because
there may be an EQ3, etc.  Also, I should wait and not upgrade my computer,
because prices are always dropping and a newer video card, etc., is always
around the corner.  If I had this attitute, I would never get to play EQ or
upgrade my computer.

My argument is that Sony / Verant will not support EQ1 players forever.  If
they get transferred to EQ2, that's a lot better than losing everything when
they shutdown the EQ1 servers.  People will still be upset because of the
different game environment and rules but at least everything they earned and
spent all the time on, they can keep.  This is the only way I would play
EQ2, albeit reluctantly.  I'm sure you would still upset some players in
forcing them to convert.  But this would be better than completly shutting
them down, losing everything.  That is my fear and my argument.
