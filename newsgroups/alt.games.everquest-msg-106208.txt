If you can solo this well with a druid (average for what I've seen), I'd
really like to see your log files for soloing sessions on classes you think
are better, since you obviously know things that the rest of us don't.

Ok, most of these guys don't become effective until -very- late in the game.

> 1)chanter ( best soloer par none with dire charm )

That's fine, but my roommate, who plays an enchanter very well can't solo
worth a darn at 45.

No, the single best soloer in the game.

> 3)shaman (best conventional soloer)

A severely unbalanced class, as far as I'm concerned, just like bards, only
not as fun to play.  I wonder if Abashi plays a wizard....

Epic required for epic pet.

I'd really like to see that log session.

How many AA points does that require?

Near the bottom with rogues, warriors, clerics, and pallys, yep.

Not even close.  If you're going to say that a druid belongs down here, post
log files of a shadow knight soloing better, as I'd really like to see that.

> 10-11) closely followed by paladins and beastmasters.

Who obviously deserve nothing in return for being wanted in neither solo,
nor group situations.

Proof by assertion.  A time honored rhetorical technique.

If you've played them ALL, I would hazard a guess that you haven't played
them very far.  Either that, or you're a drain on society, and need to be
forced out into the real world to get a job.

Enchanters only stand a chance very late in the game.  Shaman don't do so
well until then, either.  Only necros can outshine druids for soloing.  Of
course, it seems shamen, necros, and wizards don't have to med, either.
That's why their downtime isn't a factor, right?  Oh, and a druid can hunt
better in the nude than most classes can hunt with decent gear for the same
level.
