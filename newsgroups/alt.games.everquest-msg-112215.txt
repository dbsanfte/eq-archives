I had previously thought that having to run around the Shar Vahl pit and
Shadeweaver's looking for silk and carapaces was the most frustrating
quests I had attempted until last night.

I started the Gavel of Justice quest in Everfrost just for something to
do for a couple of hours. Well, a couple turned into 9+ out of sheer
stubbornness on my part to get the stupid wep (lousy stats and all!). No
go, but nearly got an entire level worth of XP from Ice Goblin
Necklaces!

That got me to wondering. As I've only been playing EQ since late
December, what other frustrating experiences lie on my path?
