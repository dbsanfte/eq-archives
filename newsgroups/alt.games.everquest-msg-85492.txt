Y'know what?  Picked up the Testament itself from the Erudite, no problem.
Played cards with him while I was there ... fourth draw was the jester.
Ported to NK, ran to Highpass, popped up a track, and there was Dylinn.
Camoed, went to the smuggler's area, he was chatting with a smuggler who was
very red to me at 33.  Waited a sec or two, the red smuggler trotted off.
Root, Combust Combust, Combust, loot the corpse, port to Misty.  The whole
transaction took about an hour from start to finish.

Things never go that well for me.  CT will crash again tonight ... just wait
and see.  :-)

Crash
