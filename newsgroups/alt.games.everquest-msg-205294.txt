hey, you're a melee, you don't have to worry about spells.....

level, because there's nothing stopping you

going from 60-65 won't take very long, and then you can go right back to AA

if you were a spellcaster, you might not want to plop down a chunk of change
for a lvl 63/64 spell, but you have no excuse!

go for it!

j00 can do eeeet!
