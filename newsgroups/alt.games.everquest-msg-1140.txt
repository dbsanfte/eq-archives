I've bought, traded and sold many accounts over the years. While I can say I
have EQ experiance going back to Beta 2, I can honestly say, I can play
every class very very well. Regardless if I bought/traded the account or
not.

Not everyone that gets their characters off ebay are newbs. Heck, half my
guild owns more than one character, which they usually bought. =)

I like Turbines hands off approach to Ebay with respect to Asheron's.  Their
comments are usually "Pffht, its your money, want to waste it? Suit
yourself, its not our problem."
