The Palestinians *didn't* lose the second world war - they didn't
take part in it.  At that stage, what is now Israel was then the
British part of the carve-up of the old Ottoman Empire after
the Great War.

After the end of the war, everyone felt sorry for the Jews after
the full extent of the Nazi death camps were uncovered, and
any objections to the creation of a Jewish homeland in the
Middle East were rapidly put to one side (the atmosphere
must have been much like that immediately after 9/11,
where anyone objecting would likely have been called
a Nazi)

Yeah, and how did the Palestinian people lose the right to live in
their homeland?  You know, modern Greece used to be a part
of the Ottoman Empire too - we don't say that because there
was a change in the politics the Greeks lost the right to live in
Greece.  Go learn some proper history, and throw your comic
book version away, why don't you?

Oh, and the Ottoman Empire ended when modern Turkey began,
back in 1921/22 with Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.  The Ottoman
Empire wasn't signing *any* treaties 23 years after it ceased to
exist, and IIRC Turkey was neutral, with a leaning towards
the allied powers during WWII - but, anyway, Turkish territory
never included modern Palestine - that was a part of the
British Mandate since 1919.
