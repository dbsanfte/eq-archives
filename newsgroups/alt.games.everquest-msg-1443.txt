I think you can say that about a lot of classes. I've grouped with plenty of
people who don't know how to work within a group. Another reason I don't
care for pick up groups. Luckily my warrior got some excellent advice from
one of the first people she grouped with, and now knows pretty well what her
job is. I recently met a (twinked) warrior of the same level as me (17 at
the time). She didn't taunt, she didn't dual wield because she wanted to
carry her fancy shield (which she didn't even bash with). No wonder my
shaman friend was having to act as tank when he grouped with her!

I'm not one of the people who only wants to solo in EQ. I like groups. I am
surprised how much I really like my warrior character, after picking that
class because I thought it'd be easier to learn the game with. I plan on
playing Jororie for a long time. But, she needs a group. I started Raniele
(the rare female human necro) for when I couldn't find a group for Jor. Will
Raniele group? Most definitely!  All the time? No..

I guess the point that I was trying to make is that I don't get pissed when
someone doesn't want me in their group. I don't think this will change
whether I play for 1 month, 6 months or 5 years.  Just my laid back
personality, I guess. :-)
