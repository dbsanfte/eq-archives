That makes me a bit suspicious. GM's are supposed to only respond to 
random tells by telling you to make a petition. Its one of the first 
things they drill into them. I know this because I know a GM. (And yes, 
he thinks most of his co-workers are incompetent gits.)

I've used root a bit with the enchanter as a way to pull.. root, tash, 
slow, step in (to get pet going), Debuff, DoT, nuke to break root and 
try to agro kite. Of course if I had snare...

I've been in other games. In most cases the GM service sucks. It's an 
industry wide phenomenon. Believe it or not EQ and SWG support is some 
of the best I've had. I'm not saying it's particularly good, but it's 
some of the best I had.
