Ye frigging gods.  You'd think you were unemployed or something.  Do
words like _brevity_ and _parsimony_ mean nothing to you?

Well, enough rhetorical questions.  After a while, it's like Mystery
Science Theatre 3000 with typos.

Moi?  (I'm no Scotty, and I ain't neither your "lad," sorry.  Dollars
to doughnuts I'm older'n you, anyhow.)

Anyway, you still misunderstand.  If you can't grasp the simple
concepts, don't pretend to understand the complex ones.  It makes you
look foolish.

See my previous sentence.  I was willing to let it go, because it's
_not_really_important_ (and really, why do I have to explain this to
you?).

But if you want me to paw through Google and look for a few choice
examples of your authority-worship, by all means, just ask, and I'll
see that ye receive.

You see, I was under the suspicion that you had abandoned the tactic
as fruitless.

Ah, so you _do_ flaunt your education given the right opportunity.  So
everything you've said about education is basically worthless?  (Or
your education has been basically wasted, since you didn't actually
learn anything in all those years.)

Oh, and that, too, is a sort of argument from authority.  (Also
special pleading:  <whine>"Look at all my background spent studying
'logic'!  Why can't you all understand me?"</whine>)

And what, precisely, is this "background in studies of logic" you
speak of?  Did you toss _A Demon Haunted World_ into a dry fishtank
and observe it in a state of rest for a few years or did you actually
attempt to read the thing?

Irrelevant (unless you're pleading Alzheimer's).

As far as I know (or care to know), you're just another academic
boogerhead.  (Whoops!  Was that ad hominem?  My bad.)

That I wear more denim than you and don't drink fancy-pants wines
makes no difference.  (Look up:  allusion and metaphor.)  If you deem
me unworthy of response, maybe you should stop responding to my posts,
hmm?

The expression is, "Brevity is the soul of wit," not "Logorrheaic
rambling is the soul of wit."   (Logorrheaic rambling is the soul of
diarrhea.)

No, but a frank admission of your inadequacies is hardly necessary for
them to be obvious.

You don't say?

Yes!

Who writes your dialogue?  This is funny just reading it out loud.

Wow.  Better get to work, then.

Having a laugh at your expense is hardly a puny motive.  It's my chief
grand design in the universe.  (Heh heh.)

Why do I care?  I mean, really, at least give me a reason to care.  It
doesn't have to be a big reason.  I accept cookies.

So this is really about Sylvia Plath, and not at all about your own

Huh?  Oh, no, I was listening to an ELO CD.  Sorry.  Go on.  I believe
you were trying to say something funny.

No, I generally open a window whenever I read your posts.

Wait!  Could you use a variant of the word "understand" just one more
time?  I don't think I quite understand you.

No, I want you:
 to remain on-topic (reduce the ramblage)
 to cut to the point
 to edit
 to learn the art of the focused paragraph
 to realize that I am not a tolerant audience, and will never be
 to unlearn what you have learned
 to grasp that conveying information in a clean and efficient manner
is far superior to burying it in a verbal quagmire
 
and, thereby, retain an ounce of dignitiy, however pathetic.

It's not difficult to write with clarity, ease, and efficiency. 
Practice!  Read a paper every now and again.  You might even learn
something else for a change.

Which I seem to have no shortage of.  In truth, it's not a big deal to
stand up to your turgid prose.  But if you can't be bothered with
presenting information in a clear manner, I cannot be bothered to
absorb it.

Hence the mockery.  See how that works?

Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Paper.  Rock.  Rock.  Rock.

Paper covers rock.

I seldom criticise your grammar or punctuation, spellos or typos. 
What I _am_ criticising is your burdensome prose.  If you expect your
ideas to float, don't coat them with lead.
