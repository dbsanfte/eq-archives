I would say shaman....I am partial of course since I 2 box a 65 pally and 64
shammy. Shaman slow rocks, and their healing abillity is quite sufficient
especially when combined with a paladins. Haste, buffs, sow, ferine avatar
(can't wait)....hehe make for quite a nice melee combination. The gimpy dog
helps some too ).  The only minus in my book would be no KEI...but thats so
readily available now days and long lasting that it a non issue to me. I
suppose the ideal group would be 3-box pally, shammy, chanter tho ; )
