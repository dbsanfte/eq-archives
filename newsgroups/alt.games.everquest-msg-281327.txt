wander is just about all you can do in Second Life.  Other than look at 
people's houses (woopee *yawn*) and chat.  I could chat with strangers on 
yahoo chat if I'm that desparate.  There's not much point to it, there's 
nothing to kill, no questing, no "game" to it.  No reason to have that 
dreck taking up space on my computer.
