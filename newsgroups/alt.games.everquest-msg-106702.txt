I believe he said he was in sebilis. Hardly pre-50.

That is a 5 level difference in ability. Plus he was not even maxed to 175 yet.

Which is quite large.

Only melee classes get the bonus.

You are also forgetting haste. Melee classes usually have haste items,
most clerics don't (I hope). Also, would the shaman or chanter cast haste
on the cleric?

I have seen this phenomenon mentioned on the steel warriors board
and the mage and monkly business boards. Usually when someone
posts how they out damaged the rogue and posts a parsed log and then
everyone laughs.

Proximity and packet loss will account for the loss. I think Verant may even
have code to drop excessive information. Do you really want your client to log
the hasted attacks of melee characters?

I still think the paladin will do more than 4 times what a cleric will.  Certainly
any other melee classes.
