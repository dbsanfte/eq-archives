If you can't find in your guild area in Ak'Anon, try Neriak's necro 
guild- remember to invis v. undead past the ghouls. Or you can try the 
Evil part of Echo, and I *think* it's for sale there too. Freeport necro 
guild has it, as well as Qeynos, and the smellie humies shouldn't try to 
kill you on sight.
