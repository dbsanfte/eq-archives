Of course they could. So what? I never said that everyone who *does* farm 
that way, does it for KEI. Now you're just making stuff up in an attempt 
at fanning the flames. Please step aside until such a point at which you 
can begin to make some attempt at reason.

Obviously that's a lie, because you're still here. Funny thing about 
newsgroups - you don't *have* to "listen" to *anything*. All you "hear" 
is content selected by *you* personally. Therefore, don't bitch about 
other people bitching.

Bullshit. Do all your logic trees consist of only the one branch?

More bullshit.

Wait! Guys, please! Let me do it this time. Ahem...

Irony, thy name is Usenet.

Plenty of support, on both sides I might add. What are you doing here if 
it bothers you so? Go on about your own business. No one died and made 
you the all-knowing referee.

Nope. Only brushed aside by those whose position is threatened by the 
facts. Pay attention.

Don't tease me.

Yet here you are, utterly smacking of troll.
