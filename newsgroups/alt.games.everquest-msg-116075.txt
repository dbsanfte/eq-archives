    Notwen, what is the lore behind the General in Kith? AFAIK he sure ain't
in exile.

    So WHAT direction is Faydwer from Antonica via Freeport, then? The NPCs
in game support the map.

    High Elves claim they do, because they have the highest starting WIS. I
claim dwarves do, because I'm a HP cleric and dwarves get the highest
starting STA. Curious - do humans or wood elves get the highest STA when
making rangers?

    Chuckle. Name another cleric bracer with more MANA on it. There's ONE
bracer that has the same MANA on it, but since Vulak seems to be out of the
game right now nobody's getting that. I would argue that the lack of HPs on
it makes it inferior to other items that have HPs, but every high elf that
has quested one is still wearing it.

    White Dragonscale Helm. Dread Coronet. Crown of Narandi. Crown of the
Kromzek Kings. All have higher AC, better HPs, and usually the same or
better total resists than the Helm of the Tracker. The Crown of the Kromzek
Kings is even a direct comparable because they both have Truesight:

HotT: +20 AC, +12 Str, +12 Sta, +15 vsFire, +15 vsCold
CotKK: +35 AC, +10 Str, +10 Wis, +10 Int, +25 vsMg, +10 vsFire, +10 vsCold,
+10 vsPos, +10 vsDis, +100 HP

    Which of those two would YOU wear, given the choice? Looks like you need
to kill Tormax more. ;-)

    You forgot to look at the pottery stuff. The original idols were trash,
but the new set of idols includes this:

Golden Idol of Karana: AC 4 STA 4 WIS 5 MANA 40, PRI SEC RANGE, recommended
level of 20.

    That isn't so shabby for mid-levels compared to the stats on bows.
Hardly end-game material, but only the most recent Tunare fletching stuff is
really end-game material.

    Because it apparently was balanced enough that you didn't whine before
the Tunare fletching was introduced. If a change could alter the balance
negatively today, a change could set it right in the future.

    Fixed how, so your race/religion choice is exactly as powerful as
another, the RP aspects of it be damned? "Karana needs bows and arrows, too,
so I can feel good about my choice!" That's about all it is - you didn't
know how good the Tunare bracer was until a cleric like me told you, and I
sure as hell wouldn't have regarded a Karana ranger as being unplayable
until you said so. It's not like groups ask, "Are you a Karana ranger? Oh,
we don't need one of those!" Nor do guilds.

    I've seen that debate before, and won't touch this with a 250-range
bowshot.

    Blackburrow and Crushbone are about equal when it comes to quality of
newbie dungeons. GFay has almost no landmarks, so finding something to kill
is miserable. The bank and shops you speak of are in a treehouse city that
has to be the hardest place in game to find something in - even the maps
with the game mapped it wrong. I'd mention the wood elf newbie corpses
littering the ground beneath Kelethin, but with the new below level 10 rules
that isn't so much of a problem. If I were a brand-new Karana ranger, I'd
take a trivial run to Qeynos and level up in the newbie yard (hopefully
Fippy wouldn't jump me on the way). If I were a brand-new Tunare ranger, I'd
try and make the much more dangerous run to Butcherblock to level up there
after whacking a bat or two near the lifts.

    That I agree with 95%. I don't have the personal experience with
Everfrost to know how far one can progress there, but I do know the
progression on Faydwer and it is very smooth.
