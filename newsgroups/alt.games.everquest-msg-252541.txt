Graeme,

Does that analysis extend to the pure in game example I gave of selling 
you the North Karana bridge for 50kpp?

After all an agreement was made, payment of 50kpp has been made. It was 
clearly fraud, as I have taken your 50kpp, gaining from the transaction, 
and the N.K. bridge isn't going anywhere.  We have already established 
that (at least control over) the 50kpp has monetary value...as people 
are willing to pay for it.

So do you think the courts will recognize that a fraud took place?

Ultimately I think there is no dispute that a fraud took place. It 
clearly did. The question is whether or not committing fraud inside a 
the context of game is actually illegal. Or is it merely a violation of 
the games rules? (or in some games, perhaps even endorsed by them!!)
