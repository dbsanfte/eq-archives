Between your wife, and the two other women he has to bang today, where is 
he going to find time to clean your gutter?

(In his autobiography, Wilt claims to have slept with over 20,000 women in 
his life.  Assuming he never slept with the same woman twice, he's still 
doing 2-3 new women every day.  Variety is the spice of life, but spice 
alone is kind of weird tasting.)
