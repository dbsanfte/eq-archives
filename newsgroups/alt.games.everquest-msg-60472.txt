No giant on the direct route through Kael can see through invis.  Credit
where it's due -- I first read this at EQ Atlas.  But I have passed through
to WL (exploring, too low to do much there yet) several times invis and
never had trouble.  The one time I got slapped down was my first real try to
get through.  I took a wrong turn and came too close to a real badass.  Two
seconds worth of pummeling and a loading screen later, I decided to log out
and make a Rallos Zek Troll mule, which I got bound just inside the zone, to
drag the corpse.  Kudos to this group for that advice, posted about a month
ago (even before I found myself in need of it).

So take a map and go invis, and you should be in WL in no time.
