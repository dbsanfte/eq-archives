I've now tried messing with /dopropertinting, but to no avail.  I
should point out that when I say naked, I mean NAKED - no clothes
whatsoever, not even a corpse-naked state of dress.  Humans look like
Action Man or Barbie.  Anyway, I've now given up and re-installed - a
lengthy patching process is happening right now.

Incidentally, the graphics card in that machine is a 32MB Viper V700
(non-ultra).  Nothing great these days, but it's served me well.  The
whole thing is soon to be replaced, though - it's only a P3/450, and
zoning is painfully slow.  I think I might have finally persuaded her
to put her hand in her purse.
