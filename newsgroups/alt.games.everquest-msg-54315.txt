Lavastorm is nice at this level.  Mem up your new dd vs summoned mobs
and hunt lava crawlers, and elementals.  Watch out for the elementals as
their ds can be nasty.  If you pull to near the entrance to Najena you
have a zone line to run to in case of difficulty.  lavacrawlers
frequently drop blood stones which sell for decent amount to merchants.
