I've encountered some occasional *horrible* video lag within the last month.
It's definitely the game because I did a full system reformat when nothing
else worked (Hell, I've rebuilt systems for less reason!) and still had the
same problem.  Had to log, sometimes reboot to cure it.
It hit me really bad again as I was heading into FV tunnel from DL.  Zoning
sometimes helps, but this time it didn't.  For some reason I hit alt+enter
instead of logging and it was lag-free in windowed mode.  Switch back and
it's still giving me joy!
Has worked for me every time since we've been able to do this.  I guess
there's another good reason for windowed mode for me at least.

Sean...
