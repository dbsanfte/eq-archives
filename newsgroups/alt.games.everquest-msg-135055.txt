    It would have to be on commodities that are consumed (like tradeskill
supplies), which sell well, and for which the competition from other recipes
allows for inflating price. Example: some people use the Solstice Robe
combine to skill up in tailoring. The price of the components is cheaper
than skilling up with Othmir Fur Caps. You could mass-produce sacred
Tunarean silks and do what you suggest, up to a point - the point at which
making and selling Othmir Fur Caps becomes cheaper than making Solstice
Robes.

    I suggest it has to be consumables because twink gear is a market that
becomes glutted very fast and which will switch to alternatives faster with
price pressure.
