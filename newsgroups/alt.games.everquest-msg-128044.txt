Yes. I have it (PP) slaved to my evade macro. I don't even think about 
it. The only time I take it out is if I'm grouped. If you're grouped do 
NOT pp without letting them know. As a matter of fact, you need a high 
PP skill for the epic.. you have to PP an item from someone.

Skill level is the only real factor. Sneaking and position don't really 
matter.
