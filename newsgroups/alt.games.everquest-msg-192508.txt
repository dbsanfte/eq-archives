Try turning off your firewall, firing up EQ and after you are all the way 
on to a character on a server go into windowed mode, free up the cursor, 
and then turn your firewall back on and let the dialog boxes come up.  
Something like this is what I had to do to get the freeware version of Zone 
Alarm to work (exact same problem).
