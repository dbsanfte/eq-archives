Heck of a lot more than that if you take into account the cost (or just
depriciation) of the computer, ISP charges, phone charges (if applicable),
electricity and computer furniture. Then you could always throw in the loss
of money you could be earning from the part time job or other money making
endeavor you could be working at. Let's not even try to price out the social
costs of spending your valuable time online instead of doing something with
family and friends.
