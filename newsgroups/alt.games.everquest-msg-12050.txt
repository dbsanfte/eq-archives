I have a question..Does anyone know if you can move your characters from
sever to server?  I do not use Fennan Ro (SP?) or Terris-Thrule (SP?) becaus
all my friends are on Quellious (SP?) but I do not want to lose my chars
because I have worked hard on them.  So if I can move them how....

Thanks

Eric
