No, it's rather obvious. Would you rather they showed the Spellbook? TV
reports on movies don't show the boring bits either.

That is not any more real or unreal than the "cool" parts of EQ, and
whether you powerlevel or camp is entirely your choice. I'm yet to camp
one single mob* in over two years of playing. If you dislike the game so
much, vote with your money...



*I did camp Mooto once, when I first became able to kill him, for half
an hour or so. It was revenge, rather than Phat Lewt.
