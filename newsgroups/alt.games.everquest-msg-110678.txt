Ok, I'll extend this a bit farther.  I also recognize that my take is as
valid as everyone else's, in as much as it's as imperfect as everyone
else's.  OTOH, I think there is a perfect definition of good and evil, I
just don't think we understand it yet (myself included).

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
