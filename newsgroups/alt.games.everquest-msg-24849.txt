It wasn't directly because of the ducking that the sit was nerfed. It didn't
stop you casting instantly, it just made you sit, so at the point when the
spell went off, you were sitting, and then it didn't go off (kind of the
same as duck used to work).

However, there are several long cast items in the game that were not being
used "as intended". E.g. JBB - shaman only bracer that casts a DD. Casting
time - 8 secs. So, what was happening was, player starts casting DD. Player
sits down. Player catches med tick. Player stands up and finishes the cast.

Really what should have happened is that the sit command should stop the
spell casting the same way the duck command does now, but I guess it was
easier just to change it to this way :/
