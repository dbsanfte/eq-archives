Chanters dont get /pet commands with their summoned animations.

2 solutions....
1) At 59 (i think) you can learn animation empathy, and 12 aa's will get you
the /pet attack command.
2) Charm something (dire charm works too) and then your pet has all commands
available.

I don't suppose either of these are much use to you at the moment. Just pull
with something low agro (shallow breath) and then your pet or someone else
can easily get agro off you.
