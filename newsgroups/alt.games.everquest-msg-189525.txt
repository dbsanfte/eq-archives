Personally, I am on Coldain/CoV faction, and I do shop in Thurgadin for 
those few items I can't get elsewhere, as well as work on the shawl quests, 
so you don't have to convince me, I was just pointing out that there is no 
reason to zone out of PoK to Nexus, the Shadowhaven in order to purchase 
most items, as they are available right there in PoK.  Once you learn where  
the vendors are, there is not that much running around needed to get the 
supplies you need.
