I've setup a windows 2000 machine.  In 4 days of playing Everquest
with it, It has gotten an error when I press play after the patcher
finishes.  The error is:
ERROR: Couldn't load eqmain.dll.

the second window with this suggest deleting eqmain.dll and the
everquest knowledgebase wanted the eqgame.exe and spt.eff deleted as
well.  
This did no good.  
I think getting the error depends on the loading of the servers.  My
sucesses were very early in the morning and mid-afternoon.  My
attempts to connect in the evening didn't work.  I've got a second
machine with win ME beside the win 2000 and it's connects with no
problem.  

Any ideas?  I've dropped a line to EQ's support but haven't heard
back.

Thanks,

Robert
