FORT HOOD, Texas (AP) - President Bush rallied U.S. troops at the =
nation's largest Army base today, telling soldiers who might see action =
against Iraq: ``We are ready, we are prepared.''

``You'll be fighting not to conquer anybody but to liberate people,'' =
should force be required in the Persian Gulf, Bush said. His voice =
swelling with emotion, the president quickly added that force remains a =
last choice.

``Wherever you serve or wherever you may be sent, you can know that =
America is grateful and your commander in chief is confident in your =
abilities and proud of your service,'' he told thousands of cheering =
troops.

Bush also sought, as he has done in the past, to draw a distinction =
between dealing with Iraq and dealing with North Korea, which has =
defiantly vowed to continue a nuclear program.

``In the case of North Korea, the world must continue to speak with one =
voice to turn that regime away from it's nuclear ambitions. In the case =
of Iraq, the world has already spoken with one voice,'' he said.

Bush addressed about 4,000 Army personnel, all clad in black berets. =
They sat, for the most part silently, through the segment of Bush's =
speech addressing the dangers posed by Iraq. But later, when the =
president spoke of the possibility the soldiers may have to serve in a =
war, the signature ``hoo-ah'' cry with which they had been peppering the =
remarks became a deafening roar.

Asserting that ``some crucial hours may lie ahead,'' Bush sought to =
steel the troops for future action. ``I know that every order I give can =
bring a cost,'' he said.

``I also know without a doubt that every order I give will be carried =
out with skill and unselfish courage,'' he added. ``We know the =
challenges and the dangers we face. Yet this generation of Americans is =
ready. We accept the burden of leadership. We act in the cause of peace =
and freedom and in that cause we will prevail.''

The president's speech -- and the prospect of war -- had soldiers in the =
audience confronting the stark reality that a decision by their =
commander in chief could get them killed.

Spc. Eric Wilkerson, of Corpus Christi, Texas, acknowledged he was =
afraid but ready -- in part because he knows his 1 1/2 year-old daughter =
would be cared for even if something happens to him.

``Anybody who said he is not nervous or scared is lying to himself,'' =
said Wilkerson, who is engaged to be married. But, he added: ``I would =
not be afraid if I lost my life if it would not be vain.''

Said Spc. Cody Newby, of Kellogg, Idaho: ``I've always wanted to go to =
war but now that's it here, just the thought of getting killed makes me =
not want to go.''

Sgt. Santos Martinez also admitted apprehension but said that is =
tempered by confidence in his training.

``I signed up. I volunteered to serve,'' said Martinez, of Big Springs, =
Texas. ``If my country says it's worth it, then personal thoughts, =
aside, I say it's worth it.''

Bush said the nation's armed services are already engaged in ``the first =
war of the 21st Century,'' the battle against terrorism.

``The stakes are great. The terrorists have shown what they intend for =
us. And we're not going to forget,'' said Bush, who was wearing an Army =
green fatigue jacket.

The president arrived at Fort Hood, about 90 minutes from his Crawford, =
Texas, ranch, with an array of heavy-duty, sand-colored military =
hardware readied for his inspection. Along with troops in formation, =
Bush was given a demonstration of an Abrams tank, a Bradley Fighting =
Vehicle, a mobile command center, an Apache helicopter and a Paladin =
howitzer.

The installation is home to the 1st Cavalry Division, a highly mobile =
unit that relies on helicopters and tanks.

It is also the home of the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized), which =
uses advanced digital systems to provide soldiers with a view of entire =
battlefields and who is on it, faster communication and more accurate =
firepower.

Fort Hood has more than 41,000 troops, but had little role in the war in =
Afghanistan. During the 1991 Gulf War, about 25,000 troops were deployed =
from there. While many soldiers have been sent to the Gulf region as =
part of the effort against terrorism, none has been sent there as part =
of the current buildup for possible war with Iraq, said Maj. Jay Woods, =
a base spokesman.

With an Iraq war decision looming, Bush told the troops that even now, =
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein ``can end his defiance and dramatically =
change directions.''

``He has that choice to make. We certainly prefer voluntary compliance =
by Iraq. You see, the use of military force is this nation's last =
option, it's last choice,'' the president said.

Bush's visit to the base came as he neared the end of a two-week holiday =
break at his central Texas ranch.

He said terrorists, including those behind the Sept. 11, 2001 terror =
attacks, were on the run.

``They're nothing but a bunch of cold-blooded killers. And that's the =
way we're going to treat them ... The terrorists will not be stopped by =
mercy or by conscience. But they will be stopped. They will be stopped =
by the will and the might of the United States of America,'' he said.

That would be great if it were true, but America turned away from God a =
long time ago, and they will fail utterly in this conflict, the morale =
of America has been destroyed and in many ways that means the morale of =
the world has been destroyed as America really has been the guardian of =
the peace in the world for some time and soon someone will emerge from =
the shadows and claim to bring peace and order to the world and you will =
eagerly climb into their shackles of bondage in exchange for imaginary =
freedom and false pleasures at the hands of a merciless subjugator who =
give you immortality and then cause you to suffer until time itself has =
ceased to exist and your only thoughts will turn to death, but death =
will not be a luxury avaliable to you anymore as it was to your =
forefathers who you have carelessly forgotten.=20
