Checked out with a bunch of people who said that at low levels, the tasks
were typically to kill 10 red mobs solo, which even a necro there (assigned
to kill in firona vie) was saying was impossible. At high level however
there are reports that the new zones are "uber", the loot better than GoD,
the mobs easier, etc etc, and even the tasks change from killing red mobs to
killing blue or lt blue, which is trivial for some classes.

So I'm an idiot for getting this expansion, because as a time limited player
the tasks system was appealing (i thought it would be like SWG) and I'm
unlikely to ever have a 66 level character.
