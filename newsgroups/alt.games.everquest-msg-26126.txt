You're exaggerating somewhat, yes?

Getting the twink good equipment is important in the long run but for
the short term it don't matter at all. The twink is killing things
with the druid's damage shields, not weapons or spells.

Getting to 9 or 10 in Steamfont takes about two hours, assuming no one
is hunting the mino caves (I would never power someone at a place that
had folks camping in it). It takes about two hours or so to power to
14 in the courtyard in unrest, again assuming that no one is hunting
the stuff there. Unrest is particularly good since, of yard trash,
only ghouls will run away.

15-20 takes a bit more time because you don't have the luxury of
monsters who fight to the death, most of the time. If Oasis wasn't
always full, it would be perfect, but unless its 5am you'll probably
be out of luck, and the leveling slows down.

But still, 20 in a day is certainly not a one in a thousand thing.
