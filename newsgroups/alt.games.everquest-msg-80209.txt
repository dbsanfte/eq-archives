Here are the weight limits:
Level 15, Limit 15
Level 30, Limit 16
Level 45, Limit 17
Level 51, Limit 18
Level 55, Limit 20
Level 60, Limit 24


Learn to bake, make fish rolls, thats 0.1 weight food, last longer than 
normal food.
Forget about copper and silver. Destroy it, 40 coins weight 1, so 40pp a 
LOT lighter than the same amouth in copper or gold.
