As far as Dawnshroud is concerned, I have found the XP to be
excellent. I play a 39 dwarf warrior, and I am getting decent xp from
the zelniaks. From 35-39 I would recommend the "fungi house" near the
Sanctus Seru zoneline. The shrooms in the house are overconned, as I
was soloing dark blues frequently.
