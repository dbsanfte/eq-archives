Answering to myslef lol, i tried the scent of dusk thing, that spell
stuck but heat blood was resisted, only tried once since it burns
mana for nothing, leveled up to 16 in the oasis and now i have
way to many spells again, now i use
shielding
spirit armour
shieldskin
heart flutter
disease cloud
banshee aura (yes i took the trip to the overthere to get it, payed
over 17pp for it, waited forever on the return trip from timorous for
the raft to take you back to oasis, gated in the end)
restless bones
lifedraw
leech

/Regards Berth
