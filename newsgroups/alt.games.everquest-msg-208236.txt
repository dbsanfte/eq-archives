Go to this site and read through from the beginning of the strip...  It is the
ongoing saga of a young Druid and her unlikely 'groupmates' as they make their
way across Antonica in search of her Father...

This strip is far and away my most favorite EQ related comic out there...  No
offense to Woody over at GU as his stuff is always hysterical too, but I really
like the serial fashion that WTF has...
