If God can create something that he can't destroy then he's not 
omnipotent because his creative powers are limited, and if he can then 
he's not omnipotent because his destructive powers are limited...

Omnipotence is inherently self-limiting. Finding yet another 
omni-paradox isn't noteworthy. Can an omnipotent omniscient being get 
'lost', can he 'create' something he can't destroy, can he 'forget'?

Oops, look like omnipotent-omniscience is inconvenient all round.

Though, not necessarily independant of space-time itself. Perhaps he's 
simply not bound to *our* space-time. (In fact if we accept the 
hypothesis that he created the universe, it stands to reason he's 
outside of it.) Where does that us??

Transcending the concept of time itself isn't so easy as you make out. 
Simply invoking transcendance is not sufficient to justify your 
argument. Occam's Razor should preclude us from hypothesizing some 
exotic transcendant unreality as God's playground, unencumbered by time, 
but not locked in stasis either, simply to preserve a notion of 
omnipotence, particularly since there isn't a compelling rational 
justification to require omnipotence in the first place.

You *can* do it. But why?

Along another line of reasoning...
Among the most universal truths we have identified thus far in our 
search for understanding of our universe is that to affect the universe 
you have to be in it. There is no such thing as an outside observer, 
observation is interaction. Perhaps God created the universe around 
himself... or perhaps it is a manifestation of himself. This last 
approach in particular allows for interpretations of omnipotence and 
(instantaneous) omniscience that don't violate free will.
