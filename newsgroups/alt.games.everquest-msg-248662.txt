Winterfury's summary covers what I remember about it, but...

That's for the Vex Thal key.  Entirely different animal, and you'll need 
to kill Emperor Ssraeshza first, and collect 8 more shards.  The DSP shard 
is easy to get... if you don't even have a key to the Emperor's area yet, 
you could probably safely delete it.

Although, mine's still rotting in the bank.  Do as I say, not as I do! :)
