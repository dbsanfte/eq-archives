Quick, someone get Zymyool a medal...

I think you're right.  I've blasted to the desktop a few times
since the last patch or two, but couldn't quite reproduce
what I had done to trigger it.  Most times were in the
spellbook rememming spells, though, just as you mention.

I think you may have nailed it.  I'll check the next time
I'm in.
