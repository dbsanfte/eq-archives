Yes, thank you! I never read the book, Cannery Row, but I absolutely loved
the movie. I know, comparing apples to oranges :) I agree with you, he is a
wonderful writer, but some people I know thing that his descriptions are
much too long. I also never read The Pearl or The Red Pony. I'll do so, on
your recommendation.
