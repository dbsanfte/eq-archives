It'll run under 98 I imagine, but
a) the method used to infect machines doesn't exist on 98
b) the shutdown method blaster uses won't work on 98 either.

For the OP: if you are capable of doing so (seem competent, talking about
replacing Powersupply) try going into bios and lowering the bus speed of
your processor (assuming yours in configured in bios). An overheating
processor can cause reboots.
I'd also check your power supply.
Depending on the motherboard, it should have some method for getting at the
power/temps, get on the net and see if you can find motherboard monitor
software (there's several free packages, names escape me, they aren't big,
should be downloadable in a couple of minutes.)
See if it shows voltages out of range, etc.

My father's machine was experiencing similar problems. Under load, about 5
min after power on, his PS started dropping the 3.3 line, till the machine
rebooted around 2.5v a couple of min later.
