Yeah, that was a classic.  You could always sense impending doom the 
minute someone joined the group and first thing they said was "Follow me!" 
or "I know this great spot!"

You mean, 2 druids, and neither of you memmed gate or an evac the instant 
he said that?  And saved enough mana for it, of course.  Yup, your fault.
