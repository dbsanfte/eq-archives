Netscape 6.0 was a complete horrific blunder which should never have 
happened. Slow, bloated, unstable - terrible.
Netscape 6.1 and 6.2 were progressively much better, but Netscape 7 
(when it is released), which is based on Mozilla 1.0, is leaps and 
bounds ahead of 6.x in terms of efficency, speed, stability, features, 
everything. I have noticed Netscape 7.0 PR1 has a memory leak in it 
though, but it is still a pre release. If you can't wait for Netscape 
use Mozilla instead, but you'll just have to install all the plugins 
(Java, Realplayer, Acrobat) etc seperately.

If you are used to Netscape 4.x then there is relatively little to learn 
in using Mozilla/Netscape 6 or 7. Once you switch to the classic theme 
its almost exactly the same to use as 4.x is.

A few things I love about Mozilla:

Its fast (benchmarks have it mostly on par with IE, sometimes faster)
Its stable
Its much more secure than Internet Explorer/Outlook Express
Its very customisable
Features - tabbed window browsing option, multiple skins, ability to 
turn off automatic javascript popups, makes use of the third mousebutton 
natively, search from the URL bar (no seperate google window), text zoom
