Quite a while ago now, I had a program for organizing raids. It
allowed you to have all of the people attending and loot info and all
that kind of stuff. I know that PoP has the new raid feature, but not
everyone has it at this point. Does anyone know what I am talking
about, or what is one of my mindless dream states where I encountered
this.


Thanks
