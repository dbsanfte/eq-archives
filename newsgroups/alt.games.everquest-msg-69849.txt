Suit yourself. I played mine to 25, and my warrior into the fifties. Get
used to some hard times ahead. The mid to later twenties, until you make
29 and can start kiting, are a humungous PITA for wizzies. Sure, if you
have solid guild support and don't have to worry about grouping or
support, it can be easier, but it's a tough row to hoe. It's designed to
be. The OP is used to playing a warrior. I've done both, and I'm trying
to warn them they are in for a rude shock. Yes, high level wizards rock.
(I know two post 55 ones). But the road to get there is a very
differnent one than warriors, particularly if he wants to solo any good
percentage of the time. (Which you WILL end up doing unless you have a
guild providing ready made groups.)

Get a grip and play your wizard a bit further past the teens before you
load up the shot-gun mouth.
