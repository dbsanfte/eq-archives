Ok, this *may* have already come up and been discussed to death here,
but I was on vacation for ten days and wasn't about to download and read
through nearly four thousand posts, so my apologies in advance if this
is old news.
  Was the graphics engine significantly changed/upgraded during the
early August patch? I logged on last night for the first time since Aug.
2 and I swear that everything looked crisper and somehow..... different.
Or is it just that I spent so much time away from the tube that I'd
forgotten? 
  This was in the old continent, too, but it seems to look even better
than Vellious. My better half commented on the same thing. We were on at
an odd hour, and almost nobody from my guild was on to ask about this.
One of the only ones online, when I asked, said, "looks great, huh?". 
But they were fighting and that was about it.
  Just wondering if this is all in my feeble mind or if VI really found
some way to beef up the graphics. My troll looks like he has more
"joints" in his body for more realistic motion when walking... lots of
other changes. Or there may just be LSD in my Earl Grey this morning.
