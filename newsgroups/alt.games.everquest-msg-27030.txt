EQ is not a roleplaying game.  The current game balance simply DOES
NOT SUPPORT IT!

Let me explain.

In a true roleplaying environment or one that attempts to get as close
to an RPG environment as possible, the current class capabilities are
simply not balanced to support it.

In a true RPG environment you would never have druids, rangers, and
paladins grouped with shadow knights or necromancers.  The roleplaying
aspects of those classes would not support it.

However, there are unique abilities of each class the otherside does
not have.

Bet those RPers who are paladins would disregard their roleplaying in
a heart beat if they need their corpses summoned from some deep nasty
dungeon.  Because you know, SKs and Necros are the ONLY classes with
that spell and any paladin in the game would have to violate their
"roleplaying" roles in order to even deal with an SK/necro other than
to beat the shit outta them.

Verant is trying to make this work with the new Sullon Zek server, but
even there they have to make changes to the existing blue server rules
in order for even a semblence of roleplaying to take place.

RPG elements in EQ is a cop out for VI to use when it supports their
arguements of nerfs or other changes.  It's also conviniently
discarded at the first opprotunity when their all mighty vision is in
question.
