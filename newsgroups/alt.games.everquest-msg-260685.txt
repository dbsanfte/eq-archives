Until you have the AA to make your pet stay no matter what happens, I'd 
let someone else do the pulling.  Until then, anytime you are hit or cast 
upon close enough to your pet, he will run over to attack whatever is 
hurting you.  You can try spaming /pet back off repeatedly while you are 
pulling, but, that will get to be a hassle.
