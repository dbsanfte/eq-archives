I've found that most people are posting to Usenet with tools that
bottom post and most e-mail users top post. Of course, it's not
consistent and that's what we really need. (Sort of like Zone Left.)
When there are multiple levels of reply, it can become hard to read if
some people are top posting and some are bottom posting. However, if
you're the FIRST reply, it don't really matter, whatever the RFC says.
