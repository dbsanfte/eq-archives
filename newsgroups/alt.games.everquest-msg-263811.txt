Well, I'd imagine there's going to be some compressing of the files on
the installation CDs, as is the case with most software. So, counting
a direct burn to CDs of the installed game isn't going to give an
accurate figure. Like I said, though, I don't doubt it will be several
CDs, but I wouldn't count on expecting more than 5 (even though it is
still possible).
