Hate's Fury is pretty much a raid zone unless you have a very very good 
group.  Lots of casters, lots of 'em unstunnable.  Loot can be decent if 
you can get the Captain to spawn (requires 4 somewhat rare drops, we 
cleared a lot of the zone and didn't get any of 'em).  A few named, some 
decent gear for the effort (we had I think 3-4 groups in the raid and 
blew through pretty quickly.  Got in a tight spot with 3 unmezzable 
clerics at once though).  I got a 14/25 +20 HP/Mana mace out of it to 
skill up 1hb with :P  I still use it on occasion, it looks cool ;)  BTW, 
there's a graveyard in this one ;)

Dulak is fun, but they need to up the drop rate on some quest pieces.  
Could just be because I've spent more than a few hours there trying to 
get the parts for my druid's 44 heal without seeing either of 'em drop.  
Was two-boxing a charm duo with her and my 45 enchanter and XP was 
alright, though nothing spectacular.  Druid can easily outpace it 
quadding the remaining dark blues on Gunthak's beach.  Cash loot is nice 
(lots of gems), and the only-a-little-rare named dropped a decent hybrid 
earring and some +6 WIS boots that were a nice upgrade for the druid.  
Also pulled a 7/18 and some misc stats piercer out of here for the 
enchanter.  Watch out for the ones with the shivs though.  Can be a lot 
of trouble getting a cast off with their 18 delay and the little bastards 
hit hard with 'em.  If you have a tank, get a scout charmed and they'll 
BS for 260s ;)

Torgiran I've been to once or twice.  Wasn't exceptional in any respect, 
but then for most the time I (56 or so at the time ranger) was in a trio 
with a 65 rogue and 65 druid.  Stumbled across a miner with about 450khp 
(I held aggro and the rogue got a few solid minutes in with SoV up behind 
this thing, had to evac when the thing was only down about 2% of its 
health and the druid went lom).  Made our way to some named that 
absolutely chewed through us.  Called in reinforcements and it turns out 
it's unslowable, so that was pretty much the end of that.  I've seen some 
pretty nice loot out of here that friends have acquired, though I'm not 
quite sure what it dropped off.

Nadox is okay as far as loot (decent ammount of nameds, some fairly nice 
twink pieces but I haven't actually pulled anything out that I'd use on 
my main).  Soloing 61ish necro gets AA there pretty quickly, but grouping 
the XP per mob drops through the floor and it's just not worth it for XP 
past the mid-50s.  Getting Nadox himself to pop seems pretty easy, and he 
drops a nice resist ring among other things.  There's also a ring event 
in the temple with some decent rewards.  Since I got Icewind I haven't 
gone back much.

Overall I really like LoY.  I like the "feel" of the zones and such, and 
it is good XP and loot outside the planes.  The few gripes I have about 
it are pretty minor.
