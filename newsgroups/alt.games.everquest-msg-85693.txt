Exploit ?. I think not. Why wouldn't a multiplayer online game have
multiplayer quests ?

Probabaly as intended for some quests. Others that must be combined in
containers are not.

No I think it requires committed solo play or play for money and buy the
needed item unless you have friends online that happen to have the other
part you need.

interacting and getting plat moving around ?

Warnable ? For playing a game as designed ? You may not like a feature of
the game. Indeed I doubt there even exits a player that likes ALL features
of the game. That sure doesn't mean its an exploit or bannable just cause
you don't like it.
