I've taken a couple two to three month breaks from the game and it was the
best thing I could have done.  When I took these breaks it was with no plan
to necessarily leave for good, but also no real plan to come back.  When I
did come back the whole outlook I had about the game changed.  I began to
play the game to experience the journey and not the rewards.  I made a druid
(yeah I know they are the bane of many people;)  so that I could more easily
travel and see places I've never been.  I made it a point to not spend too
much time in any one area and to always try to go to new places.  I became
fun again in a way it wasn't before.

I'd say you have the right idea.  Keep your account and walk away for a
bit.  Maybe it's only a week or maybe it's several months.  But if you come
back I bet you'll have a fresh outlook on the game and what it means to you
to play.

Just 2 cents from a part-time lurker in this group,

Moriarty
