I don't believe this is always true.  I was fighting a couple of sonic guard
wolves in Katta Castellum, and got far enough way that one of them gave up
and walked back to its spawn point.  I finished the one I was on, medded up,
and went back for the one that had gone home.  It was no longer aggro on me.

However, I've also seen it go the other way.  That is, I lost one, went back
for it, and it came for me as soon as I got near it.

In the first case, I had waited a lot longer before going back--long enough
that any spells I had put on had worn off.  In the second case, the mob was
snared.
