But that's the point, in a sense... There have been two, soon three, new
MMORPGs that have had the time and means to learn from al of EQs
mistakes, and yet they have failed to make an impact. I think this shows
that EQ is at the very least a very competent game indeed.

Of course, if your point is "Verant designers *are* stupid, it's just
that the designers of other MMRPGs are even more stupid", then I can't
really give you a counterargument there, just a /shrug.
