It's a good spot if you have a solid group.  Start by pulling the
entryway mobs, then move up to the bridge and pull the mobs on the far
past the gate, especially going to the right.  When you have cleared
all the way to the right, move into the open space in the northeast
corner of the zone.  I generally set up camp around +250, -600 and
pulled the from the top of the temple looking thing.  I found it a fun
place for groups in the 40s, and since a lot of the stuff is undead,
your clerics can even nuke a bit.
If your group leans more towards 40-45 you might do better just
setting up camp on the east edge of the bridge and pulling the mobs to
the left and the right through the gate.  The respawn is fast enough
there that you'll stay busy, and you're not in that much danger in
case you have an overpull.  If another group is hunting elsewhere
though, you may want to pay extra attention to any train calls.
Nothing like seeing several red mobs running through your camp as
their prey slips across the zone line.
Running across EJ isnt that hard.  It is one of the few zones where
SoW is not just a convenience though.  Full of 30-40ish mobs, mostly
animals and a few skeletons.  Nothing too terribly tough, but you'll
want to run along the south wall all the way east and then run the
east wall north until about p200, then head west and you'll run right
into CoM entryway.  If you stay on the walls, you generally won't
aggro any mobs, unless someone is kiting, but I can't think of ever
seeing anyone other than myself kiting the walls there.  (And no, my
kite isn't going to aggro on your when it's being constantly hit for
220/tick worth of DOTs and I'm *just* out of reach of him.)
