If the responsible parties can be found, the response I would favor is the
careful insertion of a top assassination team.  The terrorists' aides would
come in the next morning to find the guards unconscious and the guilty men
butchered in their beds.  Violent enough to make a definite statement, but
it wouldn't harm anyone else.  The trouble is that true fanatics will
happily die for their cause, so while this answer would preclude further
activities by the target(s), it wouldn't do a lot to dissuade future
terrorists.
