Go to the EQLive website. Click "Latest patch message". Upper-right
corner, there's a list of previous patch messages as far back as June.
Click the one for September 4th.

About 2/3 down, second item under "User Interface":

- Item Links: When you inspect an item with Alt-Left-Click, the item
inspect window stays up. To paste a "link" to the item you're looking
at into your chat bar, click on the item's graphic. That will "speak"
a link that others can click on to see the stats of the item, as if
they were inspecting it themselves.
