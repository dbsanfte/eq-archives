I find that rather strange that it didn't work for you.  Are you using the
new pet controls?  I used the button there, and when you click SIT it makes
pet sit, and the word changes to STAND (actually all is lower case).  Making
a copy of that button (for hotkey) makes text say "Pet sit" or "Pet stand".
I did this about 24 hrs ago (after the 1AM patch on 9-27-2002).
