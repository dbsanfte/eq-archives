Sometimes, with all the bitching I hear from a lot of people who play EQ, I
think there's something that needs to be said:

The past few weeks, I've realized something...as much as people bitch, moan,
and generally whine about how much people on their server suck, they're
scammers and pharmers, only concerned about ph4t L3wts, for ever person like
that there is on a server, there's 4 more unsung heroes that give their time,
their money, their mana, and their concern to other people and other people's
needs. 
And that's what makes this a great game. It's not like other MMORPG's, where
there's so many hacks and pvp groups that's it's no longer fun, it's 3 hours of
trying to send your fist through the monitor. Unlike DAoC, people have been
known to sit and chat with friends, rather that doing anything else such as
leveling or raiding. Every server has their communities and subcultures.
So three cheers for the druids who never charge for a port, and will do so at
the drop of a hat for a friend in need. For the clerics who travel worldwide to
rez a fallen comrade. For every person who gave their time, their money, or the
breastplates off their backs to help someone, and expected nothing but
gratitude in return.
May you continue to make this game as great as it is for a long time to come.
