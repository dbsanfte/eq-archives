Ok here is my story: I am aa 51 year old mother of two boys who just started
me out in eq. I have spent 6 days slashing and kicking my way through the
badlands in frount of Freepoort city then working my way through E. comms.
My boys gave me some armer and a better sward and two backpacks. As I have
made money to replace what they gave me to start with I have put it in the
bank. They told me when I was finished with it to give it to another newbie.
So thaaat is what I have been doing. One of their friends gave me a Jagged
Blade of Mourning but said I shoulddd never let it out of my hands till I
reeplaced it with something better and never loan it. I had no ideal what it
was till my son look at it last night and told me to hang on to it till
level 50. Here is my problem, for the last two days I've had players saying
they were going to report me because I would not lend them this Item. They
also said something about putting my name in the chat room. I offered to
help them out by helping them to lel but  they just wanted the sword. Can
they do that?

I would ask my ssons but neither is online riighht now?
Thanks
Pat
