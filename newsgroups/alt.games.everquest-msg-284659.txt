My hotkey bars are almost entirely populated by buttons I've dragged 
there, rather than socials, because I like the visual cue that tells me 
when the abilities and spells have reset.  I see that you've taken that 
into account by leaving the ability window open, so I can see that your 
method has merit, and adds the functionality of allowing you to include 
/loc or /time and so forth in your macros.

I don't generally use the number keys, though, I'm a mouse user; I click 
directly on the button, and its more intuitive for me to see the button 
I'm clicking on directly, and whether it's greyed out or not, rather 
than watch my spell icons over there and click on the macro's over here, 
and my ability icon over there and click on a macro over here.

Then there are abilities like Sit and Attack and Hide, where what I want 
to know is whether they are on or not, not due to cycle time 
necessarily, but just to see whats going on at a glance.  Since those 
occupy different pages on the ability window, I'd have to page back and 
forth to find out.

And I keep the ability window turned to the social page 2, which is full 
of macros like /hidecorpse and /dragcorpse and so on and so forth; 
things that get occaisional use but don't belong on one of the two 
hotkey bars I normally keep open.
