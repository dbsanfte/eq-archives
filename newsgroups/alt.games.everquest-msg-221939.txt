Hmm, last two years have been disappointing as far as a server wide
event goes, maybe a GM/guide  popping on and doing something.

I don't know but maybe with the advent of Legends they are no longer
offer the major selected zone events or if they do it's usually a one

year in EK, WC, NRo.

But you never know...
