A friend and I took our new Froglok tads to Blackburrow.  My pally was 2
kills from dinging 7 when we got there, with my shammy friend only a few
dings behind.  We got in BB, dinged up, kept fighting for about another 1/2
hour.  We had just finished banging up some mobs under the first bridge when
it happened:

You have been disconnected.

Oh well, shit happens and we weren't fighting anything at the time so no big
deal.  Go to log back in and it says I'm in Qeynos Hills.  I didn't die and
that's not a melee bind spot anyway, so I'm thinking "WTF?" and I log in.
I'm in the tunnel leading into the burrow, just outside the zone line.
Shammy sends a tell asking if I went LD, because she did too.  She's in
Qeynos even though we are both bound in PoK and neither one of us died.
Then I noticed I wasn't level 7 anymore but was where I was exp-wise when I
logged in the first time.  She had the same deal going on.
OK, the exp loss is no big thing, but the zone crashed and everyone who was
in the zone lost all the exp they had accumulated there since last login.

Never saw this one before.

Sean...
