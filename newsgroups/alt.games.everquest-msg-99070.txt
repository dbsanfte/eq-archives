Yeah Diablo II pissed me off too. I bought the collectors edition in summer
2000 and the expansion for like $30 or $40 a year later.

I did like the DVD that came with the Diablo II collectors edition though.
I think the Diablo II collectors edition was $65. I bought it from
gamestop.com

Very soon after Diablo II was released I learned tha there was a 5th act
that was coming.  After a year I cooled off enough  that it was ok to pay
for the expansion. I do not buy many games. I have bills.

BUT I have been waiting for Warcraft III a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG
time.


Also the World of Warcraft ( http://www.blizzard.com/wow ) MMRPG  looks
pretty good. I may get it if it is only $10/month  to play. But I think that
game is still a ways from being released.
