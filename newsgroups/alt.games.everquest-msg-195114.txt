------------------------------

We've taken the opportunity while the servers are unavailable for
maintenance to update a couple of things.

- Increased the difficulty of the mini-bosses in the Planes of Fire and
Water to bring them in line with the reward they give.

- Added a 12% backstab modifier to the Reinforced Mephit Talon and the Gold
Runed Mithril Knife.
