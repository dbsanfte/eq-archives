Hiya, 

  I did my first exp 'crawl' through Torment last night and was
wondering if anyone had any input about the zone. I'd heard that
experience was pretty bad there which did prove to be the case, but I
think that was mainly due to the fact that we didn't have a full group
or any form of real crowd control so we had to limit our pulls to 2 or
3 at a time, which meant it took a while to split some of the mobs.
Cash loot seemed above average for PoP but we didn't get any named or
decent drops. Are there any specific parts of this zone that are worth
crawling to or setting up a camp?

Rgds, Frank
