Great idea. The "Wah! They're dumbing down the game" bitching is pure,
grade A bullshit. Especially in this case. It's not "dumbing" anything
down. It's making it so that if someone, for reasons beyond they're
control, can't log in to loot within a week, they're not punished for
it. There are plenty of legitimate reasons for this, ranging from dead
computers to financial hardship forcing them to suspend their ISP
and/or EQ service.
