Verant did not get a court order.  They wrote a letter to the author,
and he stopped selling the program.  He's now selling a more general
version, that tries to work with any DirectX game instead of just
Everquest.  I don't know if the generalized program does mapping or not.

For people with two computers, it would be really easy to write a
program to display your position on a map on the second computer, with
no risk of getting in trouble with Verant.  Here's how you would do it:

1. Play with logging enabled.
2. Have your EQ directory shared via Windows file sharing.
3. On the second computer, have a program monitoring your EQ log file.
4. That program simply watches the log file, looking for when you do
/loc, and displays a map with your position marked.  It can figure out
what map to display by watching for the zone messages.

If the second computer is running Linux, this could probably be hacked
out in a couple hours using perl and Tk.
