The only problem with this theory is that EQ2 is not out yet.  Last I heard,
it's not even in beta.  Games that are not out yet don't need any CS.  And
I'm pretty sure that they'd be able to get as much financing as they need to
finish EQ2 without impacting EQ1 at all.

The reason it was done is because CS takes time and money.  And every time
someone's name gets changed, they will kick up a fuss and take even more of
that time and money.  If something is taking up too much CS resources, then
they will (eventually) fix it so that it doesn't anymore.  Example: Ragefire
change in the cleric epic.

That's all.  No conspiracy necessary.  They just changed it so that the
limited CS resources they have can be more focused on the more important
things, like finding lost corpses.
