Yes, we need to adapt. I think it was someone from the ACLU who said "I don'
t know who decided knives should be allowed on planes, but it wasn't the
civil libertarians". Tighten airport and border security, find how this
happened under our noses when it obviously took years of planning, etc. But
if we're not careful we'll adapt ourselves right into a police state.

The most important thing we can all do is educate ourselves on the issues
behind this. Don't just rely on CNN...there are many sources of information
online and off. We need to understand and not fall victim to fear mongering
(believing that 25% of all mosques in the US are harbouring terrorists is a
nice example of this).
