If I ask a cleric for Symbol, I usually provide the gem.  I can see giving it 
away to your friends that you regularly group with but for a stranger in a 
pickup group to expect it, is either because they don't know there's an 
expensive component involved (which is unlikely by the time they're high 
enough to group with a Naltron casting cleric) or they are being jerks.

Don't know what would be worth saying to someone that got buffed and took off, 
but I'd sure let 'em know that they owed me 12 or so plat for that buff.  And 
like someone said before me, if it didn't get resolved amicably they would go 
on my no rez list.
