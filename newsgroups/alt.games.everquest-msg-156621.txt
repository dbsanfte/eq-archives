This weekend many SKs have learned 1 second can be a long time for a puller.
Saturday I was playing my Warrior and received a tell from guildmembers
needing help. It seems that the guild was trying to do the Royals in Chardok
and asked me to bring my Monk out of retirement. The SKs (3) have been wiped
out they are unable to get an FD spell to work. Either the spell is
interrupted or someone casts a spell during there cast time. Anyone else
finding it more difficult to break mobs spawns?
