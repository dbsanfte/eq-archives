Well, AB currently has the highest number of uberguilds and probably lvl
60's then any other server. My previous server, Vazaelle, had maybe 2 or 3
uberguilds capable of ToV and such, but AB now has roughly 6. The "lower
levels" 46-59 have almost a constant presence in the planes. Velk's has a
constant 50+ population. We had 3 groups competing for the main mobs in
SolB, heck, all kobold-camps there were free because everyone thinks of them
as too low.
I actually witnessed several groups/guilds >waiting< for dragons (Gore,
Naggy, Vox) to spawn.

The only reason that the Sleeper hasn't been awoken yet is that the higher
guilds want to get some more primal stuff.

I'm glad a lot of people will go back to their old servers soon. This is not
a nice gaming environment for a "lower level".
