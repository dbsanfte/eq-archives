They'll be back. 

The starting from scratch thing, with everyone else, is kind of neat 
but all too soon you have a lot of high level people. People are
already at least 50 there. Soon there is a lot of farming and a lot of
things at ok prices in the bazaar, then there is a newbie drop market
for things like spiderling silk etc, then you pretty much have your
old server except you are playing a newb on it. At that point about 90
percent of the players go home.
