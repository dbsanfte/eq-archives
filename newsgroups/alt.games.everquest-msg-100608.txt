Those look like they're establishing pointers. It sounds like EQ is
attempting to temporarily create a c:\temp directory, probably to drop
files there before it overwrites them. Then, if the directory is
empty, it presumes that it created the directory and deletes it.

Incidentally, lots of older applications (pre-Win 98) will blow out
the c:\temp directory, regardless of what's in it. It's not a good
idea to keep any files in there that you want to keep.
