    I missed the original response, so excuse me if this was covered.

    Understood, and normally that's what I'd expect to happen. But we aren't
talking one cleric here - we're talking about ALL of them. This guild has a
dozen clerics (only three above level 54), and they're ALL threatening to
walk. Perhaps you can't imagine being left without any clerics to call on,
but this guy is running a second tier guild - he can't hang the "recruiting
clerics" shingle out and expect to see those numbers replaced any time soon.
If they walk, he stops raiding, period, and that's one step away from losing
the entire guild to other, more active guilds. Do you have any advice on how
to handle such a situation? (I adventured with this guy's first char back in
our High Keep days, and feel for him.) Also, have you picked a Luclin
faction path yet, or is the path right now just "up Whisperlings to get into
Vex Thal ASAP"?
