Then they were very inexperienced, or very lazy and stupid.   Somebody on a
general raid would (i imagine) be in the level 50-60 range.. if they don't
know their role by then they have major problems.

Paladins dish out *real* melee damage, they dish out pretty good (and great
group) heals, they also have LoH.

Were key people AFK or something?  I've only done the general once.. and as
shoddy a raid as it was (big pickup raid pretty much), once the 2 warriors
died and various clerics, he turned on me.   His damage isnt big enough that
LoH would not land in time on any kind of "tank"

With 1 other cleric still alive (and my botted cleric) and a misc healer
(druid or something) I tanked him for 60% or so of his HP (this was when I
was in a really small guild, so with zero "uber" items).   We did wipe, but
that was more due to it being a big pickup raid
