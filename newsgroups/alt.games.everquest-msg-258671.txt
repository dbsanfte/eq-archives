But OP is at level 51, where he'll need 1000 xp for a level or 1000 xp 
for an AA.  We'll assume that due to his low level it takes him twice as 
long to get 1000 xp as it would at your hypothetical level.

Thus, at 50%, it still takes 4 hours for him to get both... but at 100% 
AA he'll get that first AA, and then perhaps he'll be able to use that 
AA to get XP 10% faster (whether because it helps him that much, or just 
because he doesn't die with it as much so it saves him that much lost 
XP); now it will only take him 108 minutes to level.

Or he could put 100% into real xp, and level in two hours, when he'll 
probably get xp half again as fast, so it will only take him 80 minutes 
to get the AA... unless he leaves off AA again and goes for 53 instead, 
which will still take 2 hours (because he needs more xp to level to 53); 
now he'll be able to get that AA in 60 minutes due to leveling faster.

This is why people end up waiting on AA; because the amount of effort 
needed to get an AA drops as your level goes up.

The only problem with this theory is that some AA are really worth the 
extra effort needed to get them; I'd count Run amongst those for many 
classes, as its cheap, has no prerequisites, and represents a paradigm 
shift; now you are faster than almost every mob without worrying about 
whether a buff has run out or been dispelled; running away or kiting a 
mob around till its under control become constantly available options.

I'm not sure I'd count any other AA as worthwhile in this way for most 
classes; pure melee might find the regen one handy, or the one that 
improves Bind Wounds, if they solo a lot.  Barring that, the rest of the 
ones you can get under level 61 all require you spend those three extra 
points (the ones above and beyond Run 3) plus most require several AA 
points per ability.  That means to get one ability may cost you 6 AA; 
the equivalent of leveling from 51 to 52 6 times over... not many are 
really going to change your character as much as simply leveling would have.

The other trouble with this theory is that for many classes, leveling up 
may represent a drop in xp gathering rather than a raise; if you solo a 
lot, you'll find that the mobs get harder faster than your power 
increases.  This is a deliberate game design since the early Verant 
days; we were supposed to start out solo, then get a partner, then get a 
small group, then a full group, and finally end up raiding; in this way 
our power would increase exponentially, so mob power levels also 
increased exponentially.  Sadly, a single player's power tends to 
increase only geometrically.  Worse, caps to effectiveness of stats or 
spells means in some cases player power actually plateaus out; there are 
limits to what a bard can charm, for example, so his best xp gathering 
method finds his targets being less xp each time he levels up.

If you group regularly and never have trouble finding a group, then that 
problem shouldn't apply at all, in fact I've generally found with a good 
group that the time per level actually drops each time you level up (and 
the rest of the group does), because of the synergistic effect of the 
increased power of its components.
