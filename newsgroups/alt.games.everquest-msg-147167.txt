Splitpaw entrance in SK.
Most of the mobs will be white and yellow near the entrance (first 2 will
likely be blue)
You can easily zone out if he isn't doing enough damage to get the kill.
I'd say let him melee, you DS and keep him alive then small dot (drones of
doom) and snare, rather than the zone tactic. At least he'll get skill
raises that way and should always get the kill.
