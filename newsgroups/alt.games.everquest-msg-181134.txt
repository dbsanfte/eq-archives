Before I quit EverQuest, I was starting to get the impression that
Norrath had become TOO big.  So many empty zones.  Mistmoore nothing
but a ghost town.  Unrest completely silent except for the occassional
passing tumbleweed.  Split Paw ... abandoned.  Aviak City ... nothing
but chickens.  Lake of Ill Omen ... no activity except the lapping of
the waves upon the shore.  And on and on...

Could it be that Norrath got too big for the population?  Or perhaps
the average player level was beyond me and everyone was in higher
level zones?  Or perhaps the new popular zones (like Paludal) were
packed while the rest of the world was empty?

Is there such a thing as too much content?
