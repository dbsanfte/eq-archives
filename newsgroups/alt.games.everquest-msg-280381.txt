Based on that, looks like a 20% penalty race would be halfway through 
level 58, when a nonpenalty race dings 60.  When the nonpenalty race 
dings 20, the 20% penalty race would be about almost level 19, but not 
quite there yet.  When a nonpenalty race dings 60, a halfling (5% bonus) 
would be about 57% to level 61.  Keep in mind that level 60 is a trivial 
level to complete by comparison to other levels in that range.
