I can believe that. There's a lot of amazingly stupid people there that 
would think they're doing the good thing. She may just be one of them

I don't dismiss her loss. I just wish she had enough brains to see that 
she's trying to become an Everquest Nazi.

There were plenty of things, as the previous (and very old) thread had 
discussed. She's living in (very understandable) denial. She's blaming 
problems of her son, and her lack of care on a game, because it's too 
much to blame on herself.

I'm sure she does, and I sympathize with her. But she's trying to 
control other people's lives now under the standard cattle slogan "would 
someone think about the children"
