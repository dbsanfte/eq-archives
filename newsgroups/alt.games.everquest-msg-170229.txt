Excellent write up really. I like presentations like that. After being in
several Family guilds on Fennon then moving to TP with a group of fellow
safehousers it didn't take long to witness the pull of the do we stay
family<<===>>do we move to join uber.
Family is my "style" but the downsides are real and well doesn't ideal sound
wonderful.
It would take an incredible amount of involvement to make and maintain that
ideal.
It falls into my possible but not probable and worthy goal category.
