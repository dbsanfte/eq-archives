Verant (now Sigil Games) wrote EQ, and developed Kunark & Velious. Luclin was
part-developed by Verant, and finished by SOE(*).
Every expansion since then - plus SWG & EQ2 - was done fully by SOE.


(*)And yes, I know Verant was always owned by SOE, but the majrity of the key
people from Verant quit prior to Luclin launch, the later formed Sigil Games.
