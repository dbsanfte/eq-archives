How do you keep from overpulling a camp? I hate it when I come upon a camp
where there are 4 blues. I can take them one on one or even 2 on 1, but not
4 or 5 on one. I'm a pally so have a few spells, but not my L22 ones yet.
Other than walking in and going "Tag Mr. Orc! You're it!" I've seen some use
bows, but at this point, I don't wanna carry one of those around.

Anyone have some helpful tips/advice on avoiding the overpull? Thanks in
advance.
