The mage is excellent for powerleveling because pet damage is handled
differently than you'd think.  If the mage pet beats a mob down to 1% and is
reclaimed or told to get lost (i.e., it's not around anymore), then whoever
does the remaining 1% gets full xp for the kill.  Damage done by the pet
will not be credited to the mage.  Strange, but true (also works for other
classes summoned pets).  So have the mage summon a pet to beat the mob down
to a sliver of life, then have her reclaim the pet or tell it to get lost.
Then the warrior can finish the kill for full xp.  With a warrior, I would
think you want to be sure to have him see enough combat along the way to
keep his skills, especially defense, in good order.  I would usually use the
earth pet for the root, but if you have a druid he can root monsters if they
like to run at low health.
