Now that would have been my first stab, as I'm a *huge* fan of the 
Elise, and have waiting for years to see it come to North America, but 
as you noted the price was a little high for the specific challenge. Its 
a beautiful car though!

Yep! I had an MR2 sometime back that always blew me away... it wasn't 
going to take a Vette or anything, but it was damned quick... and it was 
a mere 1.4L.
