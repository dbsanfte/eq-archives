So spending time auctioning, buying and selling doesn't constitute 
experience? I don't NEED a 60+ character to "experience" that. I don't NEED 
a 60+ character to obtain them (barring no drop -  which wouldn't matter in 
the OP's context anyway). In what I stated I certainly DO have THAT 
experience no matter how you'd like to twist it. And why did you take it as 
an insult that I stated that *I* have a life outside EQ? Where did I say I 
had more of a life than you? Gees, somebody's touchy.... <g>

I've already stated it. If you chose to discount my experience that's your 
problem. I will never (and have never) talked about "high level" or raid 
tactics and such because (as you so patronizingly stated) I don't have THAT 
experience. That doesn't mean I don't know what I'm talking of in THIS 
case.

See above. I stated what my claims were made on.
