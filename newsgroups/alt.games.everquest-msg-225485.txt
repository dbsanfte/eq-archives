I know how you feel, although not this guy in particular.  A big
problem with the HGs in RM is that a lot of people who have snare pull
with snare, and if they are down a hill you may only be seeing a giant
walking across the top of the mount.

I tend to do my giants one at a time, I could do many, I have the
ability and at 65 it wouldnt worry me much anyway, but, it still
frustrates me when I see it pop, cast, and then someone runs up about
half way through the fight (never the start!) and says "Hey that was
mine"

Sadly if its 100 percent, Id say its up for grabs, otherwise, hows
anyone going to know??

But on the flip side, if I see someone standing in front of it, either
they are going to hug it, or, they want it. I do try and look for
people when Im going to pull, sadly, I dont feel many do the same.

Who hit it first is tough coz its not who hit it first really its who
_tried_ to hit it first. After all, you can miss with arrows, fizzle
spells etc. Proving misses first is hard especially with someone whos
not in the mood to reason
