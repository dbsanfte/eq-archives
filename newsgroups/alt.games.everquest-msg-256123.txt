Yeah, most uber/semi-uber guilds would refuse you. It really helps a
ton with wipe recovery and battle rezzes. I'd much rather spend 10
hours helping a guild cleric get their epic then use your mana on my
rezz which runs you oom to Cheal the MA.

I know how much the epic sucks. I've been helping my friend with his SF
shards for god knows how long, he has 3 of the 4 now and I'm still
helping him out 2-3 hours a day whenever he needs it killing those
blasted greenies in SF :). I spent a YEAR camping trakanon for my epic,
checking almost daily, and I am so glad that I did it.
