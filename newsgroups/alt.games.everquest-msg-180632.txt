Ok. I got sick of Saryrn - wacked economy, overcrowding, crappy guild 
experiences, etc. - so I started have a blast on Firiona Vie. Trouble is, 
as many of you may have noticed, I really enjoy playing nearly all the 
classes. That's just not an option on FV. Therefore, I'm looking for a 
good server to start a few new char's. on. I'm hoping for the following:

1. Population - as low as possible without resorting to Test and being 
subject to frequent downtimes. I'm in the U.S. btw.

2. Economy - got tired of everything being devalued so badly in the 
Bazaar simply because everyone and their brother was trying to sell one. 
I long for the days when stuff was a little tougher to find and meant a 
little more to have it. Maybe that's a bit strange, but that's just the 
way I see it.

3. More genuinely new players. I know, how the heck can you know that? It 
just gets old seeing the majority of the tanks running around in full 
suits of crusty or crafted before level 10 or casters bragging about 200 
INT before they are even able to bind themselves. Just ain't natural.  :)
Even when I could really kit out an alt, I showed a bit of discretion for 
the sake of skill balance. That's just me though, I suppose.

Anyway, I'm basically looking for something a bit fresh, or at least as 
fresh as it can be anyway. If you have a recommendation, but don't want 
to ruin a good thing *grin*, feel free to email me rather than post.

Thanks
Rumble
