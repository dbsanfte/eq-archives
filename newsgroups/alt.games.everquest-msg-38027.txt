Ugh no, any item for which you are questing will drop if you have the
prerequisites, even if the mob is grey. While their is code to reduce
camping the game also allows every single class to solo. Without
humongous downtime I mean. As for the kiting thank god for that.
Kiting is the single lamest thing to ever happen to EQ and would make
any pvp game severely unbalanced. Watch a duel between a bard or a
druid and anyone of the same level. Chances are the Kiter will win,
especially against a poor melee class.

It's a pvp based game that means there has to be  no single tactic
that makes a class obsolete. All pure melee's would be rendered
ineffective against kiters. Therefore kiting doesn't exist. It also
serves to reduce the Dr00d effect and class envy.
