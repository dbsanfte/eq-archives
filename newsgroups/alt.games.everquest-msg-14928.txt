Sooner or later you should get down some dungeons and learn some skills that
will be of use in the higher-level game.
Too many people equate levelling fast to playing well, and it just ain't
true.
Just some advice from a 'grizzled veteran' who is sick to death of teaching
level 55 newbies stuff they should have learned 30 levels ago but didn't cos
they were too busy burning through levels on the Oasis->LOIO->OT->DL
all-outdoors, all-skill-free levelling treadmill.

Glad to help :)
