Why do you care? If you don't like it, don't PL. It's not like there
aren't plenty of high level idiots without PLing... And, besides, as
long as IGE is around, there'll still be high level people popping up
who know absolutely nothing about their character or even the game
itself. PLing is the -least- of the worries in that area.
