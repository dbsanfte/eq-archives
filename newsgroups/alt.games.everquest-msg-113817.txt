Ok,  
my Ranger now has some plat saved up and I wanna buy a nice 1HS for my
primary.

I am currently using a 
Jagged Blade of Mourning in Primary:
MAGIC ITEM   LORE ITEM   
Skill: 1H Slash   Atk Delay: 25
DMG: 13  
DEX: +10   SV MAGIC: +10   
WT: 4.5 
Damage Ratio: 0.52
Weapon Power: 5.20
Power Per Pound: 1.16
Damage Per Second: 10.80
Damage Per Second Per Pound: 2.40
 
and a
Centi Shortsword for primary:
MAGIC ITEM   LORE ITEM   
Skill: 1H Slash   Atk Delay: 25
DMG: 12  
STR: +5   STA: +5   
WT: 5.5 
Damage Ratio: 0.48
Weapon Power: 4.80
Power Per Pound: 0.87
Damage Per Second: 10.00
Damage Per Second Per Pound: 1.82

I plan to get rid of the centi SS and use Jagged for secondary and buy
a nice primary,  but i jus can't seem to decide what is best.
I have been told to buy a Lammy:
MAGIC ITEM   
Skill: 1H Slash   Atk Delay: 19
DMG: 9  
STR: +6   STA: +6   HP: +20   
WT: 0.6 
Damage Ratio: 0.47
Weapon Power: 4.74
Power Per Pound: 7.89
Damage Per Second: 10.00

wich is really goin fer a high price right now,  so I looked at a
Centi LS
MAGIC ITEM   
Skill: 1H Slash   Atk Delay: 27
DMG: 14  Dmg Bonus: 11
STR: +8   STA: +8   
WT: 6.5 
Primary/Secondary
Damage Ratio: 0.52
Weapon Power: 5.19
Power Per Pound: 0.80
Damage Per Second: 10.74
Damage Per Second Per Pound: 1.65

Which is much less in cost.
What I am confused about is that the Centi has a greater DPS than the
Lammy and although heaver, has nice stats and a Damage bonus too.
And last but not least, goes fer less plat

So why does everyone tell me to get a Lammy?  Is it because it is
faster and the chances of Dual Weld and Double Attack increase with a
faster Primary?
Please give me some input!! 
Thanks!
