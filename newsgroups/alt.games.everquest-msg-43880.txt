This is how it works:

You have to change 4 different parts of your computer (and these are
four major parts such as NIC, Harddrives, CPU, motherboard, etc...)
*at the same time in less than 120 days since you activated*.

Then and ONLY then is your previous activation going to "block" your
new activation and will require you to call the phone number provided
to activate your new installation.

If you don't make such massive changes within a 120 days after you've
activated the system, you're fine.  If you make a total rebuild of the
system with totally new parts after 120 days of activation, you can
still activate with the same key.

There's two options:

Registration and Activation.
Registration is not required.  Activation is.
You must activate the system within 30 days of installing the OS.  

The information sent to the central database is a hash key generated
from the PID you typed in during setup.

I believe there will also be a process made available where you can
initiate a "deactivate" process if you know you're about to make
serious changes to your machine within the 120 day period.  But that I
believe just didn't make the cut for RTM.
