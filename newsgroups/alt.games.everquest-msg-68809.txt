This is the mindboggler for me. Why the sudden switch from a tested
8.0 to the brand new 8.1, the only version that doesn't work with
win95? Saying the switch came 'pretty late' is an understatement,
I didn't pay all that much attention, but didn't they announce the
requirement on Dec. 5, /after/ the release?

The version they released on test prior to Luclin used DX 8.0,
and ran just fine on all the usual OSes. Poking around on MS's
DirectX site, I don't find any new features included in 8.1 that
would necessitate the upgrade. I'm far from a DirectX developer,
though, so I'd like to hear some speculation from someone who
is; there's bound to be some here. Now that Brad is posting
again, I guess we could ask him, but IIRC, he programmed the
MUD, not the graphical client, so he'll probably not be able to
help either.

Rune, confused (as usual)
