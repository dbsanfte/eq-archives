I have to say, even if the guy's being a dork and insisting on offtanking
when the rest of you want everyone on one mob, once that's established that
that's what he's going to be doing, if the enchanter persists in trying to
mez the mobs the guy is offtanking, I'd say the chanter's being at least an
equal dumbass in this situation, if not more of one.

That's like someone root parking a mob on top of a meditating cleric and the
cleric not meditating at all and complaining when he could have simply moved
out of range to meditate.  You adjust to what the group is doing.
