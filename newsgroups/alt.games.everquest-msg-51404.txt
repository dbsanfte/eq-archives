Yeah but since the spell for 96 percent is at 56 I'm betting a 100
percent Xp res skill would be level 60. I'm betting money on it and
would bet my first born. It is pretty much assured. Not only that, but
if it is a spell or skill you can bet your fanny it is going to have
some humungous downtime associated with it in the form of huge mana if
a spell or huge button recycling if a skill ( like once every 3 real
world hours)

That means that everyone will still want to get the ragefire thingie
of course since it can be used 50 plus and is an instant 96 res (the
same reason why a cleric of level 56 wants it even though he has the
spell)

This basically accounts to throwing the cleric class a bone on paper
only, since it will really never even be used. Hmmm you had a guild
wipeout do you cast either the huge 100 percent xp res spell on
everyone or use the skill and take like 19 hours all total or just
right click them with your stick? Lets see how long you take to guess.
One person is getting that 100 percent xp res buddy, the cleric ;) (if
it was even availible for them at that point), then its using its
ragefire stick  on everyone else.

Even if you get it at 60 you won't be walking around doing a 100
percent xp res on everyone for no mana instantly.. don't even think
you will.
