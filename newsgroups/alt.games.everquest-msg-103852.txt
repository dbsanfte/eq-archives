 Point is it wouldn't really matter. If you're good on attendence you'll
get the drop soon enough. If I was Enchanter 2 and was on a raid and KEI
dropped, I wouldn't get disgruntled with the officers if they awarded it
to Enchanter 1 and I felt we had similar raid attendence.

 It's a nice item I guess. I don't really see a wis or int caster
wanting it though. Other than the cha and mana, all the stats seem to be
geared towards a melee.
