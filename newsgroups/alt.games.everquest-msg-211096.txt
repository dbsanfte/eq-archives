Except for the poison/disease dot part, it works great on Cliff Golems in 
OT.  Only dot that sticks on them is the epic dot.  Once they are slowed, 
I generally only have to back off and heal myself once or twice during 
the fight, so I actually end the fight at full mana, or very close to it, 
pet is full health, and I am close to full health.  Mind you, they can be 
very rough to slow, some of them have resisted my slow 7 or 8 times.  The 
good thing is that while they are not slowed, they are quite upset at me, 
so I can aggro kite them until pet gets aggro, then retry slow, rinse 
repeat until dead or slowed or oom, whichever comes first.
