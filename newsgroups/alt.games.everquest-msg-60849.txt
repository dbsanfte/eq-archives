The rule is 3 hours online time. Offline time works like this:
every 7 hours offline counts as 1 hour online so if you die and log
immediately you would need to log back in within 21 hours. Any combination
of this also, for example I die and look around for 1 hour for a rez, I give
up and log back in 7 hours later then I have used 2 hours on the rez timer.
Also, please be aware that online time is for the account not the character,
so you can't log in another character on the account without the timer
running as online time.
