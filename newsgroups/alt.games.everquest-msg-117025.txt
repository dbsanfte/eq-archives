I use the command line becasue I'm more used to it.  I didn't always.  
Honestly, I can do ANYTHING from the GUI now, other than kernal patches, 
and you don't have a lot of choice if you're making custom kernals.  If I 
just want to run a standard RH7.2 build though, it can all be done from 
the GUI.  Package manager really has changed things.

Well, running RH7.2 you are running a new, bloated, GUIfied OS now.  It 
does make assumptions about your hardware.  I'm not so much of a Linux 
bigot that I believe the hype about the minimum systems.  Sure, you can 
get a Linux kernal booted from a floppy and running on a 386, but what can 
you do with it?  I personally LIKE having good GUIs.

You can buy computers with Linux and applications pre-loaded.  You can 
even buy them from Dell, or at least you used to be able to.  I personally 
prefer to have as little loaded as possible on my computers, so I spend a 
day or so un-installing junk before I even put my personal apps on, but I 
suspect I'm distinctly in the minority.  If you really think you can take 
your average Windows computer, format, re-install, and have it back to how 
you like it, you're a much better Windows man than I am.  Hell, I even 
have problems with ghosted drives on identical hardware.

Get an appropriately powerful computer, one that was built after the 
advent of the GUI, and you should be pretty well set.  Once you get it 
installed and have used it for a bit, make it your research computer.  I 
use a Linux box for almost all of my EQ support stuff, just because the 
look/feel is more natural to me.  You'll find that as with every other OS, 
there are often better applications than the ones that come bundled.  As a 
start, you'll want a newsreader, I'm a fan of Pan, though our damn 
corporate security policy blocks my access to external news servers.  Damn 
that security admin (/em bonks self).
