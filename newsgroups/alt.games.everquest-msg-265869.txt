Depends in part on what he means by untwinked.  If he's geared up in the 
bazaar, he can probably solo effectively against many low dark blue mobs.  
My extremely mildly twinked in his low 30s solos quite effectively still.  
Until recently he didn't even have a haste item, now he has an SCHW, and 
I never went in for buying buffs for him.  He was wearing mostly crafted 
armor at the time, which is a level of equipment trivial to get with the 
bazaar nowadays.
