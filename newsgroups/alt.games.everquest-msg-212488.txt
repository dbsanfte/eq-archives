Perhaps. It's a pretty safe assumption though when you don't know the
person you're dealing with. How many religions (or people faithful to
any particular religion) are willing to entertain the thought that
'hey, we might be wrong' and <insert any other religion here> might
actually be on the right track. If you do fall into that category,
good for you. 

Would you debate the fact that most people of faith operate under an
underlying assumption that their path is the correct one? ... and that
most of those also assume that no other path is?

I did, although I guess you'd have to understand feedback loops to get
it. If you surround yourself with nothing but likeminded individuals
(positive feedback) then who's going to be the one that asks the hard
questions (negative feedback) that occasionally get you to question
whether you're on the right track or not? In my mind, the difference
between a cult and a religion is how much they isolate themselves from
people who don't agree with them.

Well damn, I was expecting my post to change your mind and get you to
admit that I'm right! ... after all, I do play a prophet in EQ! <g> 

"all politicians are crooks" is a stereotype that isn't always true
but it makes a nice starting point until I'm proved wrong. The same
goes for the assumption that a deeply religious person is gonna have
certain basic beliefs that they just won't question. The same goes for
the assumption that anyone who surrounds himself with like-minded
individuals isn't gonna spend much time questioning the things that
that group believes in. The later is certainly not just a problem with
religion. 

The fact that I'm occasionally proved wrong and not everyone fits
those stereotypes is refreshing and serves to keep things interesting.
