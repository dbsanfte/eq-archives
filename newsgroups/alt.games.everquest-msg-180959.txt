Yup. And GMs won't help people who get ripped off by the casinos. I
actually agree with them: If you're stupid enough to hand someone your
money on a promise they'll give it back and more based on a dice roll,
you deserve to get ripped off. Not saying the guys running them aren't
scumbags, though...

Heh, yeah. If I see two of the same item, one at 12999 and the other
at 13000, I'll buy the 13000, I don't care if the 12999 is right next
to me and the other is ont he other side of the bazaar. 1pp
undercutting is just dirty pool...
