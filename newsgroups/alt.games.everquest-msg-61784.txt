Higher skill gives a better chance of hide or sneak working.  If it
fails, it takes several seconds before you can try again.  Since your
corpse-dragging rogue is not going to have enough hitpoints to take a
single hit in a high level dungeon, you really don't want to be
standing around for a couple minutes trying to get hidden.

Go with a Halfling...they get hide AND sneak as racial abilities.  The
advantage of having these as racial abilities is that you get them
earlier this way, and at higher skill.  E.g., halfling racial hide is
at skill 50.  You'll have that at level 1 with a halfling a rogue.  A
rogue that does not have hide as a racial ability will have to get to
something like level 10 to get their hide skill to 50.

Also, consider worshipping Brell.  That will let you move freely in
the Hole, which is a popular place for corpse-dragging rogues.  The
Hole has several monsters that see through hide and sneak, but those
things are friendly to Brell worshipers.
