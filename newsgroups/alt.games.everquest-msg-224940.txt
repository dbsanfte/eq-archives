Since when is the ability to hold aggro a warriors defining ability??

Virtually every class out there can pull aggro from a warrior.

It makes perfect sense too, the one who you most want to have hit is the 
one who has to work hardest to ensure that he gets hit. If the mobs had 
better AI they would actively select *any* class but the warrior for 
their first target... so its not remotely unfair that warriors have to 
push hard to keep taunt.

Warriors defining ability is to be the best damage sponge. Overcoming 
other classes aggro is his greatest challenge (using taunt, equipment, 
and the rest of the group cooperating to let the warrior utilize his 
class defining ability).

This is equivalent to Wizards and Rogues damage output defining 
abilites. Where warriors have to fight to maintain taunt, these have to 
take extreme care to avoid it...

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that i think the system is working 
right now. Melee and warriors in particular do need a fix... but holding 
aggro is NOT a warriors defining ability, nor should it be. Despite the 
fact that that is what would make them 'most desirable to lazy groups'.
