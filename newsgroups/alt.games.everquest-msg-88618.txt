A nice 4 person group, in my opinion, would be:

Shadow Knight (For tanking and pulling)

Bard (As someone already wanted to be one, for additional damage, reducing
downtime and god knows what else bards can do)

Cleric or Druid, both will do just fine for lower levels, it isn't until
level 45+ that druids get a LOT of trouble healing a group... though with a
bard there, that might be solved.

Now, depending on what the previous class was, I would either go for a
wizard (Good nukes, roots, snares, ports, and what have you not, if the
choice is a cleirc)

If a druid, then go for anything really. A good bard should be able to keep
mez or use charm on mobs, so Enchanter is not a must. Mage would be good,
but at higher levels and in dungeons, very often pets are banished, because
of previous mentioned pathing. Necro might be good, again for heals if need
be, DoT's, (pets), lifetaps, etc. Or any supporting damage dealer, ranger,
beastmaster, monk, etc.

Solitude :o)
