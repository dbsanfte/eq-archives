There are two very different situations here.  Xping vs raiding.  You 
have made comments regarding both situations and monks ability to handle 
the pulling for them.

For the record, for XP groups, I don't often worry too much who is doing 
the pulling.  A good monk puller will keep the group constantly fed with 
mobs to kill.  If the group has decent CC, the monk will not worry about 
bringing in singles.  Of course, just about anyone can pull if you have 
decent CC available.  Most places I go to XP, pulling singles is far from 
critical, there is generally at least one person in the group to handle 
adds, whether it be mezzing, OTing, or rooting off.  Last night, I was 
XPing in PoE with two shaman, two mages, a necro, and a warrior.  We went 
nonstop, no med breaks.  For XP groups I just don't worry about min 
maxxing things.  I don't care who the absolute "best" puller is, I am 
there to have fun.
