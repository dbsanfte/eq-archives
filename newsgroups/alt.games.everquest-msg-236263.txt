Perhaps you could have people submit screenshots and display them near
the top of page title (ie everlore, etc). Having a screen of everyone
in a zone or a scammed LDoN team decrying a player might be
interesting... Borrowing again from Allakhazam have
talkback/screenshot- the accuser could post screen and complaint, and
then all could respond, witnesses and accused. Those forums keep
traffic alive and websites populated. Maybe even expand beyond just
kill stealers and loot bandits to overall EQ problems and complaints.
Considering EQ size this type of sight might do well...

I'm easy though..any site that I can waste time on while I wait for
servers to come back up will be fine with me... ;)
