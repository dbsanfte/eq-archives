And with that inflammatory title, I'll start.

I have a 50 monk as of tonight. Having struggled for years (I'm a casual
player), I'm less than impressed at the idea my ac will be nerfed. Sure, I
*might* be able to beat a warrior hand to hand (given some hypothetical
equal equipment), but isn't the point of monks suposed to be that they are
good at hand to hand? I know for a fact that my monk's gear, while
reasonable for his level, has lousy resists, and my 30 shaman has far better
resists, and I think that a warrior fighting a caster would be
proportionately better than a monk fighting a caster.

So what if monks are better against non-caster mobs? Against dragons, for
example, their fewer hits and lower resists would make them far inferior to
warriors. They have huge problems getting loot together unless they are
lucky enough to have friends to carry it for them or are rich enough for the
rallic pack or tinkers bag, and iksar are kos for the rallic quest. Sure,
post 50s you can start making money; but I got tired of being poor and
played a druid, and was amazed how easy it was to make cash, not only from
porting, but acting as an escort to people on corpse runs, helping people
overcome faction with wolf form, tracking, foraging, tradeskills due to high
wisdom.. I could go on.

My druid has been played for far less than my monk, but my druid bought all
the monk's gear and has nearly caught up to him in xp.

Maybe the post 50 game is really really different, but for a casual player,
it's daunting to get this far, only to be told that my abilities will be
crippled so that I will have to group with warriors. Does verant hate
soloers? I'd have to say the evidence is pretty strong on that one. I like
grouping, when I choose to, and not because of a rules edit that means
endless boring "/o 50 monk lfg, please send tell... please... I'll pay
you..."
