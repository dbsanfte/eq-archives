I even agree with this policy.

That's a big "if"; you know damn well that most players aren't treating 
with your character. So what about then?

I'm not saying you have to say hey I'm a guy, and I'm married/single, 
and have kids/pets... simply saying "/g ooc: I'm role-playing a female 
elf, and that's who you are interacting with. Don't assume *anything* 
about me." would clearly dilineate the boundary that needs to be drawn 
for people who are responding inappropriately to a roleplayed elf.

You don't have to lie to them, and you don't have to disclose personal 
information either.
