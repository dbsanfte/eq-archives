It's not merely doubtful, its almost impossible, I tried yesterday, as
a 44 beastlord to manipulate the owlbears into taking over the
Grimling camp, after killing the grimling chieftain, the Grimling
defenders spawned and a short wait allowed the Furious owlbears to
approach.

I sent in my pet and sat down to med, but that s wasn't about to
happen as I immediately got summoned and started to get beat on by the
defenders, in the meantime the grimling spiritists in the back of the
chiefs tent had respawned and kept healing the grimlings, they made
fairly short work of 6 owlbears, my pet and me, I was interupted so
often that I was not able to get off my Flash of Light spell  (like a
short term fear spell). and died without any real chance of survival.

Best Strategy - go mob handed or come back at 49 :)


Mrowh 55/54 Beastlord on Karana.

Frostfist (41) Beastlord on Stromm.

Otserp (32) Mage on Venril Sathir.
