Not nearly as good a range item for encs though. :)

If you're up for some -serious- work, go for:

Zephyr of brell is basically 20% extended enhancement 4.

If that's not uber enough for you, hold out for an item with:

other Enc-usable EEIV items:

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17178

Basically, you can extend buffs by up to 25% with an item, but 50% total 
with AA's (Spellcasting Reinforcement, Spellcasting Reinforcement 
Mastery).  I leave it as an exercise for the reader to determine which 
will give you more bang for the buck. :)
