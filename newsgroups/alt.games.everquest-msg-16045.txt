I actually hunted for several nights with a group that included a
married couple, their son, and their grandson.  From the grandson I
found out that several other family members played fairly regularly.
The grandparents were very conservative players, but they worked very
well as a team.  In speaking with them I discovered that they had
migrated from paper-n-dice RPGs to EQ, and they set aside certain
nights of the week to play as a family.
