Try Higar, he's a GM everything, and he's pretty approachable about doing
stuff.  He'll charge you of course.

One of the SK's in my guild, Kastizi, is also a GM potter.  She's also
fairly approachable but also fairly busy, so you may have to wait for her to
be available.  When we're not raiding she's leveling up her BST alt, so
she's not often free to do a combine, but she might arrange to make the
time.  Again, expect to pay.

Speaking as someone who occasionally gets asked to smith stuff, it will help
your case tremendously if you take the time to collect all the necessary
ingredients first before you send anyone a tell.  A tell that goes something
like, "I have all the ingredients, could I pay you to attempt a combine for
me, please?" is much more likely to be given a positive response.  In such
cases, I often forgo charging people altogether and do the combine for free.
