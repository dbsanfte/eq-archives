I feel your pain.  My 26 Necro on Vazaelle is in the same boat.  After
finally collecting all the words for Haunting Corpse the combine failed.
At this point I'm just trying to level, as the 29 pet spell can be
purchased in the SK guild in Oggok.  I believe the rest of the pet spells
have to be researched, though, so our improving the skill isn't in vain.

In the meantime, if I come across the words again I'll just beg a high
level Necro to combine them for me :)

Good luck
