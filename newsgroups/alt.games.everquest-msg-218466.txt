Even more than that... the entire thread will not expire at the same time.

Older messages will not be available on all servers.   On some news servers
a few months worth are saved, on others I've used only a week or so.   So,
the earlier statement about "I would just go back and read the whole thread
if I wanted context" just doesn't work if that has happened.   Even if you
were interested in doing the extra work to be able to follow the
conversation.
