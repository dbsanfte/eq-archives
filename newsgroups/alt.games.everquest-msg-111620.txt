The topic of "Everquest etiquette" comes up now and again, and I'm
always fascinated by it. It almost always boils down to Druids giving
out (or not giving out) sow.

I can definitely understand the problem. Though I've never played a
Druid myself, I've hung out at the bank, or the docks, or the EC
tunnel. Everywhere, Druids are constantly bombarded with sow requests.
"sow plz", "sow me, please", "Can I have a sow, Mr.?", "sow me or
die!", "Oh kind and noble Druid, would you be so kind as to bestow the
Spirit of Wolf upon this poor wandering soul?", "sow for a ex leper?",
"sow me", "sow for Jerry's kids", "donating for sow", "how about
sow?", "got sow?", "spare a sow?", "who do I have to blow to get a sow
around here?", "somebody sow me", "sow now brown cow", "sow for the
love of god!", "guess what? sow me!", "bet you can't sow me.
whatareya? chicken?" A Druid simply cannot satisfy all the sow
requests she gets. So, she has to discriminate. This invariably comes
down to how the druid is asked. How she is approached. If approached
in a polite and civil manner, the request is often granted. If one is
rude or obnoxious to the Druid, no sow.

This dynamic should be all too familiar to the male subscribers to
this newsgroup. To illustrate, in any post, conversation, or
transcript where Druids and sow are involved, simply replace the word
Druid with "girlfriend" and the word sow with "hand job".

The similarities are striking. Everywhere Druids go, they are
constantly bombarded with requests for sow. Likewise, everywhere
girlfriends go, they are bombarded with requests for hand jobs. Oh,
maybe not verbally, but you women know that every man that sees you
wants a hand job from you.

Casting time for a sow may be lower than the "casting time" for a hand
job, but when you consider the med time required to recover the mana,
it works out.

Girlfriends, I mean Druids, often accept donations for sow (but not
required). I'm not going any further with this one.

Here's the eerily spooky one. After you get a sow, how long is it
before you need another? 36 minutes. When you get a hand job, how long
is it before you need another? Exactly 36 minutes. That is almost too
weird to be a coincidence.

This parallel makes playing EQ a bit more amusing. I'm sure you've all
heard these:

Druid_01 shouts: Accepting donations for sow.

Druid_01 shouts: Free sows at newbie lift.

War_01 shouts: Can anyone give me a sow?

Enc_01 shouts: trading crack for a sow. (I love this one ï¿½ it really
takes me back)


So, next time you're asking that Druid for a sow, treat it like you're
asking your girlfriend for a hand job. You wouldn't say "hj plz".
You'd say "Honey, can I have a hand job please. I'm on a CR."

Oh, btw, this is the reason I never solicit sows from male Druids.
