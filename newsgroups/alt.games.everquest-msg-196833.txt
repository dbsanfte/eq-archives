No no... be careful when you reinstall with that disk set!

There is a bug in that installer, and it continues to trip people up to this
day.
When you reinstall using the seperate disk sets (Trilogy and Gold dont have
this problem)
Install the Classic EQ (base game) disk first, then make sure the following
installs
are all to that same single directory!! The Velious installer will try to
install to
a different directory. Dont let it! This messes people up all the time.

Me.
