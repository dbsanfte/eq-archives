Because many people hide unread messages, and thus don't see the full
history of a thread and changing the subject throws them for a loop. Because
some newsreaders count changing the subject as starting a new thread, and
some don't, screwing things up even furthur. Oh, and it's also extremely
rude... the person who starts a thread asking for information could well
lose the thread because of your antics.

I don't really care what you do, but I can guarantee you that you'll be in
alot if killfiles if you keep it up. This may or may not matter to you, but
the whole idea of Usenet is to disseminate information. Being in someones
killfile isn't the best way to accomplish this.
