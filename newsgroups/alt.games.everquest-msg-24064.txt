Your guide character will be on a seperate account on a server you've never
played on before.  You're forbidden to go adventuring with that character.
If you're caught doing otherwise, I'd imagine you'd get your play-account
banned in short order.

Think of all the grief players out there, now imagine 90% of your
guide-time being spent dealing with those people.  I'd hate to discourage
you from being a guide, since they always need more, but if you decide to
go that route, you've got my sympathy.
