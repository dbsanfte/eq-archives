I'm not really interested in this post per se, but it reminds me of a
question I've had for a while. Why does it seem like when people talk about
porting, they talk  about mostly Druids? Have you forgotten that Wizards
also port, and we do Druids one better by Translocating? Is there something
way back in the beginning of EQ that I don't know about that justifies this?
Just curious. =)
