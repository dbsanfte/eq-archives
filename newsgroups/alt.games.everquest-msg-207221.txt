I helped beta test it and I just think it needs more tweaking. They released
the game too early but I dare say once it has a few more months behind the
belt and the diehards players help to sort out some of the gameplay issues
etc. then it will get much better. EQ wasn't perfect when it was first
released either and in many respects gets worse in some ways but better in
others. I'm sure SWG will follow this trend
