It wouldn't make much sense to use root and nuke tactics on caster mobs; 
the whole idea with that plan is to prevent them killing you while you 
kill them.

What you are looking for is stun, pet hammer, and melee with stun and 
bash, and as necessary a nice quick heal for yourself.

It will almost certainly help for you to get a nice set of shaman buffs, 
primarily to boost your dex up into the stratosphere, so as to increase 
your weapon procs.

The stuns are designed to do two jobs, reduce the time the mob spends 
meleeing you, and stop him from casting spells entirely.  The more time 
he spends casting and not getting the spells off the better, because in 
that time he's not meleeing.

DOTs are attributed, unless the DOT caster zones or dies after casting 
the DOT, at which point they become unattributed.

Mind you I don't know if you can take the Jin Shaman solo, I'm not sure 
how much luck you'll have travelling in Seb at all, solo, but I'm just 
saying the method you suggest isnt' the ideal one.
