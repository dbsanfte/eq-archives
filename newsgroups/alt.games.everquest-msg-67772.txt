The game (EQ:SoL) is "ONE" week old:

1. For the lat week you are entitled to a refund of $2.26
(Divide $9.99 by 31 days in Dec and multiply times 7 days).

2. Return the game to the store you purchased it from.

Grow up. 

Boycott Sony if you want, but try to get a grip on reality while you
are at it.
