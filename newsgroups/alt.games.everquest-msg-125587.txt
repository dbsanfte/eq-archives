You can't find out the exact population, but you can still sort the servers
by population on the server select screen so the lowest population servers
are on top.  You may not actually want a low population server as the game
world is no so large (and will get even larger with PoP) that you will have
an easier time finding a group on a high population server.  Of course, if
you want to solo your whole life this is irrelevant.

I wouldn't call any class worthless, but necros and mages are often
considered underpowered in the high level raid game.  This doesn't mean you
shouldn't play one or that they are bad classes to play, but their
effectiveness decreases somewhat after 50, and I wouldn't be surprised if
they are upgraded in the near future.  As usual, clerics and enchanters are
the most in demand classes.  Yes, Erudites' heads are now very pointy, it
really is distracting and I usually use the old model.
