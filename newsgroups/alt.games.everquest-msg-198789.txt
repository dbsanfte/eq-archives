I've started playing a wizard, and came up with a question about it.

If you (or your group) pulls too much and it's time to take flight, 
zoning (or gating, or evac, whatever) gets you out of there fast.  Here 
is my question:

If a wizard is bound close to the location of the fight (call it a camp), 
and he gates, ending up back in the same area, does that action mitigate 
the aggro like simply zoning would, or does the wizard in question still 
get the crap beat out of him?

It's a nebie question, and probably a stupid one at that, but the idea 
struck me, and I thought I would ask
