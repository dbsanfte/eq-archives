With all the bitching about last night's patch, I thought I'd lighten
the mood with this story of a little dust-up I had last night (before
the patch)...

Had a near thing in Everfrost last night.  I was sending my druid 16 alt
to Abysmal to buy some tradeskill ingredients, but a chanter friend gives
me some buffs so I decide to take a side trip through Everfrost to see
if I can take out a red-con mammoth.

I get off to a shaky start when it resists both Snare and a DoT, but I
run away a bit (sowed, of course) and finally tag it and start working
it over.  But it's got a lot of hits compared to my current spells, so
it's still over 50% when the Snare wears off, and it again resists the
recast, so I start running some more.  Sometimes it catches up as I
pause to cast, and the occasional whacks are starting to hurt.  I decide
this whole attack was a bad idea, so I head for the Magus to zone out.

Now, I have a hotkey bank for this very situation: a set of keys bound
to macros that do /attack off, /target Magus, /say <destination>.  With
a bit of timing I can fire it off while running past the Magus; I've
practiced it before to make sure it works, but this was the first time
I'd tried it under pressure.

I run toward the wayfarers camp, selecting the hotkey bank as I go.  As
I pass through camp I press the first Magus hotkey that comes to hand.
Nothing.  Must've been too far away.  But it does switch my target, so
I can't easily go back to trying to snare the mammoth as I continue
running.  Get whacked some more, which at least retargets it for me,
so I hit the mammoth with some more spells.  Eventually, at about 25%
myself and the mammoth at 40%, I head back to the Magus to try again.
I stand in front of him pounding on my hotkey, but he won't transport
me!  Maybe because I'm stunned by the mob?  Try again.  No luck.  Check
to see if my keys are going into the chat window (I've made THAT mistake
too often!).  Nope.

About that point some kind soul in the wayfarers camp heals me to 100%,
so I go back to fighting.  More spells, more kiting, after a while the
mammoth and I are both down near 20%.  I head for the Magus, again fail
to zone out, again someone heals me.  Finally I drive the mammoth below
20% so it tries to flee, and I follow and finish it off.  I loot it, go
back to the camp and thank the two people who'd helped me, and with a
calmer head approach the Magus to try to leave.

At which point I realise why I'd been having so much trouble with him
during the fight.

It doesn't work real well in Everfrost to tell the Magus you want to
travel to Natimbi...
