Spellcasting skills are very easy to increase; I wouldn't spend
any training points on them.  Find some quiet corner and cast your
lowest-level spell over and over.  If it's a nuke that requires
a target, you can use any corpse.

I generally use training points to get hard-to-raise skills (such
as weapon skills) to 20 or so, at which point they start going up
easier on their own.
