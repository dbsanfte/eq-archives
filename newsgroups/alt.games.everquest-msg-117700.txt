Your math is correct. Might I recommend that you save some of the
excess keystrokes you use for exclamation points to spell out words
like "per?" Otherwise, I may have to open a window before we all drown
in punctuation.

>Whats the fun in that???

Gosh. It's been so much fun, I don't know where to start. But, for a
short list:

- It was great fun levelling through to 20 without having to deal with
Orc 1, N/S Ro, Oasis, High Hold Pass, or any of the other two dozen or
so zones I grouped in with my 3 previous characters who stuck around
long enough to be memorable. I've enjoyed low-level groups, but by
that point, I'd spent 75% of my 2+ years playing EverQuest in them and
only maybe 3 months playing the 50+ game, which I was enjoying
immensely. Unfortunately, I had discovered that I was not
tempermentally suited to playing a necromancer at that level.

- It was great fun leveling from 20 to 35 in Lake of Ill Omen,
Frontier Mountains, and the Overthere. I know that other people
denigrate these zones, but I think that Lake of Ill Omen is one of the
best-designed zones in the game. It helps immensely if you learn to
turn off zone chat, pick your groups carefully, and have a sufficiency
of gear that you can leave a group and go solo for a bit if you choose
unwisely.

- It was great fun grouping with my friends' alts and even a few new
people in Great Divide, Eastern Wastes, Crystal Caverns, and the
Overthere from 35 to 43 or so.

- It was great fun raiding with an RP shorties guild through most of
my forties while acquiring my OS and HS keys, adventuring in Kaesora,
City of Mist, Karnor's Castle, and when distracted, Dreadlands,
through most of my 40s.

- It was great fun rejoining my level 55+ friends in Chardok, Old
Sebilis, deep Karnor's, and the planes from 48 to 52.

- It was great fun, from 52 to 55, exploring Luclin with my friends,
old and new, and exploring new parts of zones I'd seen briefly as a
necromancer when I was fortunate enough to find a group.

- It was great fun, from 55 to 58, relentlessly raiding Kael Drakkel,
taking down thousands of giants to establish my credibility with the
Claws of Veeshan well enough that they would entrust me with their
armor quests as my guild and I cut a swath through the halls of
testing.

- It was great fun burning through level 59 in under three weeks of
delving into Cazic Thule, Howling Stones, Akheva, Maiden's Eye, the
Crypt in Old Sebilis, The Deep, and a few other zones I might never
have seen as a necromancer of any level.

- At the same time, it was great fun raiding with one guild, joining a
second, and eventually founding a third. It was great fun raiding the
planes, dragons, giants, the Halls of Testing, and a ton of other
locations. It was great fun helping to take down targets like the
Vindicator, Dozekar the Cursed, Wuoshi, Trakanon, Gorenaire, Velkator,
Lord Steve, and a ton of other targets that I would have only been
able to see with a character I was no longer enjoying if I had let my
rogue languish at a lower level.

>Do you know your way around your local area????

Despite having a horrible sense of direction in all sorts of
first-person games, I actually know Neriak very, very well. In the
year+ I spent getting my Ogre warrior to level 27 and the year+ I
spent getting my Iksar necromancer to level 55, it was one of the few
locations I could buy and bank. I tried a few other characters in
between my necromancer and my rogue, but found that I hate most
starting city zones as they seem to have been designed before Verant
really got the hang of it.

Of course, I also consider Thurgadin, Cabilis, and Shadowhaven home
and know them all fairly well.

>Do you know what critters there are in your local area??

I used to. But, they added a ton of new critters recently for the
revised newbie quests. So, I'm being freshly surprised by new MObs as
I pass through Nektulous.

>Have you any idea what your hometown looks like???

Yes. All of them. See above.

>The game is journey to level 60, not a destination !!

No. The game is what you make of it. With my first character, the game
was a *long* journey to level 27. With my second, it was a journey to
the realization that I didn't want to level a warrior up again. With
my third, it was a discovery of what the game world had to offer and a
chance to establish many new in-game friendships and learn the
higher-end game. With my fourth (current,) character, it was a
quicker, nostalgic trip through the first fifty levels in which I
looked forward to being able to play with my friends, who were now all
closing in on the high 50s, again. Incidentally, I still quite enjoyed
the journey this time through. But, I strongly doubt that I would have
enjoyed it as much if it had taken a year of doing the same things I'd
been doing since I started playing the game  while I got to hear about
my friends doing all new things that I'd never gotten to do because I
was grinding out the levels again.

>I feel sorry for you, I don't think you have seen the game.

Well, that shows that you know fuck all about me. I've explored every
zone in the game except for Crushbone, Kerra Island, Ocean of Tears,
Plane of Mischeif, Vex Thal, Sleeper's Tomb, and Veeshan's Peak. And,
I did a big chunk of it BECAUSE I hurried to catch up with my friends
again.

>And in case that your Rogue is your character no. 23
>I would look around for another game, cause you are
>apparently bored with EQ if the only thing that matters
>is to find some way to get from lvl 1 to 60 in 2 weeks time

My rogue may be character #23. I've tried a *lot* of combinations
before settling on a class/race combo I could stick with and enjoy.
She's my third or fourth "main" character. Rather than "relearning"
everything I'd done with my first 3 mains, I elected to get her to
where she could play in parts of the game I'd never gotten to see as a
necromancer.

Incidentally, while your math at the beginning was excellent, here
it's not so good. Even if I had played 2 weeks non-stop, it would have
totalled noticeably less than 50 days. In fact, it took about 8 months
to get from 1 to 60 and, while it was many things, it was rarely
boring.

>Just my 2 cents

You have grossly overestimated the value of your opinion in this
matter.
