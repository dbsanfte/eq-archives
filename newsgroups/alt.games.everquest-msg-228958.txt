I'm not sure exactly how the pathing in eq works.

It appears to be a graph of sorts, with some alternate code for 
following in close proximity, although some zones defy this...

But anyways graph traversal, particularly if the graphs are designed 
deliberately to be easy to traverse is very efficient...at least that's 
probably how I would do it.

Teleport it the opposite of the 'safe' area? :)
Depop it?
Send it to its spawn point?

Anything beats leaving it under the world.
