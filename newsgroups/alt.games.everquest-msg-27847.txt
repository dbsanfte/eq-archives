As another Lanys player, I can confirm that that shit list does work.

I have seen a group of 4 tanks and an enchanter wait at karnors zone
while a shitlisted cleric was spamming lfg, and decide to wait until
another one showed up.

I've seen a fear raid stalled for lack of clerics, and choose to have 30
people wait around for another hour rather than take along a shitlist
member.

One instance of bad behaviour probably wont get you onto the shitlist,
but repeated intentional training, trade scamming, abandoning your group
members, kill stealing or ninja looting will do.

Singling out the worst 10 or 20 offenders really does do wonders to
clean up the high level game.
