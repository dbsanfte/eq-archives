I'm basing it on tests I did well over a year ago.

I originally believed in the value of the "med bounce" myself,
due to the way the mana bar seemed to behave.  But after reading
a long discussion on the matter (I forget whether it was here,
or on the Paladins of Norrath forum) which concluded that it
actually worked as I described in my previous post, I did some
tests and discovered that when I did the "med bounce" from
oom up to about half a mana bar, when I cast a 10-mana spell,
suddenly two full bubbles of mana drained away, just as the
forum discussion had said it would.

It's possible that Verant changed the way it worked sometime
in the past year, and I just haven't rechecked whether it
had been modified (because I didn't expect Verant to make
a change that would enable what they would likely consider
an exploit of the game mechanics).

One second, going to log on and check it out...

Ok, back.

Well, how about that, the "med bounce" now works as a way
to squeeze in some useful activity between med ticks.  Handy.

Test subject:  Level 18 Iksar Shaman.  I cast spells to
drain his mana bar entirely, then did the med bounce up
80% mana.  I then cast a 10-point spell and while the mana
bar dropped more than 10 points worth (it dropped about
half a bubble), most of the apparent mana was retained.

I then repeated the experiment from OOM, but this time
I ran during every "stand" part of the bounce.  I covered
most of the way from Cabilis to the "pit" in the Field of Bone
this way.  After gaining an apparent 40% of the mana bar,
I fired off my 10-point spell and the mana bar dropped
only about as much as a 10-point spell should drop it.

This is nice to know, since my original hope for the
med-bounce way back when was to make it possible
to regain mana while traveling across a zone.  It
didn't work when I tested it long ago, but now it
does.

So please disregard my previous message.  :-)

(Murphy's Law dictates that now that we've settled the
issue, Verant will notice this thread and "fix" 
med-bouncing to not work again.)
