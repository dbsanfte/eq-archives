Speaking as someone who has multiple chars in the 50s none of which are
in a guild I'd like to point out from my perspective there is also some
stigma associated with folks who ARE in a guild <EG>.  I have turned
down multiple invites from the servers uber guild on two or three of my
chars, as well as offers too many to count on various and sundry
characters.  The total number of chars I  play is the reason for not
being guilded, I can't commit to a guild because I don't know what char
I'll be in the mood to play on a given day, not fair to join a group and
then not play with them for weeks on end.  Just wanted to point out that
the assumption that an unguilded player of higher level must have
something wrong with him might be misguided.  Which is not to say that
I'm denying there is something 'wrong' with me, heh.
