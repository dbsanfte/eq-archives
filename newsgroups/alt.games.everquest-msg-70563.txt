. Ever read that little list of terms that pops up every time
> you start EQ?
>
It's interesting, because people sell chars and plat on Ebay, some of them
with the most excellent disclaimers, one of them says (I am paraphrasing
here) "sale of this character and/or EQ currency does not constitute a
violation of ANY Verant/Sony policy.  The items for sale were created with
my time and effort, and THAT is what is for sale."  Note that my comments
may not be relevant to your thread, but I thought you might find them
interesting and amusing.  Happy hunting and Kickass Leveling to All~
