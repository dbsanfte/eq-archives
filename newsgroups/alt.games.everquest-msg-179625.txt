I don't see either of you mentioning iksar mask.

http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies.showMe
ssage?index=35&topicID=12393.topic for a list of all the masks.

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1876 for info on the 
iksar mask.  Sells for 4k in the bazaar if you're lazy, and I'd think 
it'd be easy for you to get, Meem, if you're cheap.
