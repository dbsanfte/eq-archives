Truthfully, I'm suprised they (SOE) haven't nerfed Pet canni
yet.  Spec Conj, SCM 3, Summoning Efficiency III (enshrouded
Veil), Elemental pact and Quick Summoning III allows a mage
to summon a MSII pet (2600+hp) in 5 seconds for 130 mana.  An
insta cast reclaim item (like the low level foci) gets 260+
mana back.  In 1 minute a mage can make back 1560 mana.  Add
a horse, and he's medding the entire time (250 mana?) + XPP
(+6 per tick mana regen).  187 mana per tick without any other
buffs.  The addition of Suspend Minion 2 gets rid of the only
downside, losing a buffed/equipped pet was a bit of a trade 
off.  Now, however, you simply suspend, pet canni, then 
suspend.
