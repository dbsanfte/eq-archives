Turns out a friend of mine has been using the account when I was away and
changed the password. Before I realized this I clicked on the 'Are you a
moron who has forgotten your password' button on the sony station page and
it has reset my password. They kindly emailed my password to an email
address that no longer works (ISP died a long time ago).

To cut a long story short - when they say they have 'reset' the password
does that mean they have changed it back to the original or have they given
it a completely new one. I have tried just about everything I have ever used
as a password but have not found the right one yet.

Thanks once again.
