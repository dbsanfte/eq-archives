What difference does that make? I've bought a number of games for the 
PS2 that were so awful I returned them the next day and got my money 
back. And I only spent 30 or so on them.

Why -shouldn't- someone who was that disappointed with EQ not be allowed 
to return it? (Yes yes I know the technical issues with the CD key... 
but that would be easily overcomable if SOE wanted to.)
