In general I agree with your post, but think you should read some of my
OTHER posts on the subject, you are missing a major part of what I'm
saying...

I'm GLAD they are better off, but I still want to be of use to them.

Oh, the only thing I DO object to is calling any post that questions the
fairness and balance of something VI has done as "Whining".  I have
struggled to put my views forward clearly, and logically, in the face of a
lot of flames and name-calling.

I don't think this is "whining"
