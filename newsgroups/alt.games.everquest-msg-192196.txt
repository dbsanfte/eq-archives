Either you need new friends or that was a pick-up group from hell.

You should let the whole server know about those two dipshits (cleric and 
shaman) on your server's main message board. That was total BS and totally 
uncalled for. The very least they should have done was to rez you and then 
say that they didn't want you in the group any more. For a cleric to not 
rez a groupmate is simply unforgivable IMO.
