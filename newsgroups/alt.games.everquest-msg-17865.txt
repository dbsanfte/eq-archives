I've been debating whether to give my character a surname or not. From an
aesthetic standpoint I don't like those long word strings over people's
heads. Particularly when they are in a guild with an additional eight or
nine syllables in the name  like "Billybob De'Mountaintop <Uber Lords of
Norrath United>"
I prefer to keep things simple and elegant, but I sometimes feel I'm missing
out on an important milestone and status icon of the game.

I did think of a surname for my Mage: "Overcast".
It works on many levels. I've spent my short eq career doing it, it will
remind me not to do it, it fits my grey disposition, the weather in my
high-elf homeland and my diety Karana.

Oh heck, I think I just convinced myself to do it. Promise not to steal it
first ok?
