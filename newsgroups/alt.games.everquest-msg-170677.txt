The same policy had applied to our guild... only the level 63+ people
could roll on spectrals.  Someone asked in guild "what about those who
are one kill away from 63 but haven't dinged because they don't have
any level 63 spells?"  No reply.  I actually did foresee this
happening and leveled to 65 asap.  I won 2 specs early on (beating 3
or so others on /rand).
