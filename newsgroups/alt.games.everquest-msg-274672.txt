Yes, these are the ones I'm looking for.

And what a fucking great idea by SOE - "HEY !  We added solo content
like you asked !  And to make it EXTRA fun, they're mobile, so they're
never in the same spot !  And random !  And they can only be opened at
certain times !"

Thanks a fucking bunch.

I've given up on adventuring with my 28 Swashbucker, and am going to
start building up my lvl 12 Cleric, as she's better for soloing, and
when I want to group all I need are the magic words "Cleric looking
for group."

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
