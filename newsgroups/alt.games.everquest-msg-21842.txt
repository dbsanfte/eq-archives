What I wonder is, since ATI is still a rather large player in the market.  How
will the RADEON Proccessor work with Luclin.
    I would imagine it would HAVE to work fine, or Verant would have some
serious issues on it's hands, seeing as I think ATI is still the biggest card
distributer out there. 
     Not that it matters to me, I'm saving up for one of those rip roaring $350
full version GEFORCE 3's to go with the Top of the Line Sound blaster Live I
just bought.  By the way, ECHO's in tunnels on 4 point SRS is amazing.......
