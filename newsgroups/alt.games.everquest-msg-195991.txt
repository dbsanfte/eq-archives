Yes, I do... but I still assert that in these quantities, these
stats don't make any marked difference.

Its not the mana, its the spell slot this would take up, or the
bother of swapping it in every x minutes

According to my first source, at 20 it would last 1 +
(18sec*20=360seconds)= 7 minutes.  Someone I talked to said 10
minute fixed duration.  I haven't checked.
