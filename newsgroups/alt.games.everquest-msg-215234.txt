Hehe true true...what else is terrible is the "PLZ, come across the world to
give me a rez" people. I am a cleric on Lany's and am sure it is the same on
every server...people expect you to rez them in the most obscure zones just
because it is your job...you don't know them or their guild...they don't
offer anything and you don't get anything...a few times I have been killed
going out of my way to be nice and rez someone...once it took me an hour to
get there and they had looted their corpse before they sent me the first
tell. GRRRRRR...O well it is a thankless job being a cleric but at least we
don't have to worry about malpractice lawsuits =)
