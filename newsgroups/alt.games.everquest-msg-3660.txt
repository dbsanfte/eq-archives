Before my ranger got snare, I would shoot at long range, spin and run
until missile ungreyed, spin and shoot again before meleeing. I would
also shoot at fleeing mobs. If you have lots of arrows, you can shoot
a fleeing mob, sit and wait for him to come back, and continue until
you run out of arrows or your skill is max. It's actually a good idea
to get a crappy store bought bow for this trick, as it does a smaller
amount of damage and mob will return rapidly.

Another trick is to shoot an arrow at a guard (or any red con) just
before you zone. Do this all the time, just make sure you have a clear
path to the zone. If you feel lucky, you can whip off a couple shots
in a place like Freeport, just fire off a shot from long range, then
spin and run to zone. Shoot again just before zoning. Firing at reds
is a quick way to get skill increases.
