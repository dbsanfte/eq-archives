Theres still heaps of blues in loio at 30. Way too easy in a full group, but
it might be ok for just 2 people. You could also camp outside paw... thats
pretty deserted these days. Frontier mountains would be ok too. You could
pull hillocks from the fort, or camp just north of the fort and pull
wanderers. If you could get the spawn broken, you could camp the shadowmen
in WC/LS/innothule/SK. I wouldnt recomment camping them in LF. Clopses and
giant skellies would be another possibility in RM.
