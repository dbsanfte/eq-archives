My bard was poor and lived a hand to mouh existence until at level 33 I was
fighting RyGorr Orcs in Eastern Wastes. I had lost every roll for the
numerous Orc Fang Earrings/Necklaces until the puller ran out with some
named Orc. Turned out he dropped a 1HB weapon called a Dark Ember and I won
the roll. Sold it to Guild Leader for 4K (stopped him threatening to expel
me from the Guild for ohhhh about 2 days). I now have the same old mix of
Lambent Gloves/Bracers, Bone Armlet thingies, FS plate BP and Bronze
everything else, and still use a BBK and a PGT when meleeing. At level 35 I
get a few disparaging remarks but the bard is one character where I believe,
IMO, you don't NEED the best equipment to play well. (ducks the flames :) ).

I guess I really ought to spend some of the money sitting in the bank
though!!

Take care
Karalin the Suicidal Bard.

P.S. Whenever you are travelling about I suggest you auction :- /auction
