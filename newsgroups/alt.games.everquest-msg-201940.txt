If you are interested in being in a raiding guild that is.  Many of us 
prefer the more leisurely pace of a family and friends type guild.  Sure, 
we don't get all the phat lewtz that raiding guilds get, but, we do manage 
somehow to enjoy our time playing eq.  We don't get to see the hardest to 
get to zones, but, for many of us, that is well worth the tradeoff in time 
and commitment that most raiding guilds require.
