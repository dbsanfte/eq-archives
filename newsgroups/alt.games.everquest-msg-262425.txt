I can agree with this totally.  The UN is a complete waste of time and if Kerry
had his way, they would control our country fi given the chance.

Lets face it, the leader of the UN is from a third world nothing country with
no riches, no freedoms and no future.  Think he pities the people in the US
when something goes wrong?
