These bugs aren't -that- rare. :)

CS will provide you 100% xp rez, provided you follow the instructions 
reporting it etc. My last one took around 10-12 hours to take place.

I echo they comments of the others though, just get a cleric to rez you, 
and delete the petition; the difference in xp is negligable, and CS has 
enoough to do without diddling around with people who want that extra 4% 
back :)

My last CS rez occured in Cabilis just this week... i fell for 20k 
between the 2nd floor and the first floor of the sk guild, (after 
getting stuck in the floor) coming off the ladder.

The only reason I opted for a CS rez over a cleric one is the difficulty 
of finding clerics in cabilis or willing to go to cabilis, especially at 
4am when it happened.

In POK it would be a no brainer: get a cleric rez (file the petition, 
report, and bug it, just in case the timer expires before you get 
one...and then delete the petition when you do.)
