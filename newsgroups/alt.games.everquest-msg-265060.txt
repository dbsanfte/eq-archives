Yeah, I thought the option was the best solution too.  As an option,
it's no different than saying "Turn UN and cultural victory off" in
Civ3.  Most of the whining came from two fronts, tho - folks who saw
it as nonrandom predestination, and folks who were right annoyed at
how the combat model allowed a naked spearman to fend off a tank
battalion, and wanted to re-do the 'stupid' battles.

>What's your favorite Civ moment?

The first time I clicked on the icon to play after installing Civ2 :p
Never had a chance to play the original, but I've had many a sleepless
night with 2 and 3.  And most of it's been too good to pick any one
moment as a favorite.

Memorable... civ2, playing on a fair sized island in my first step up
to regent after many warlord-level games.  Doing fairly well, or so I
thought, beating back the annoying twits on the mainland just off what
I'd dubbed 'atlantis' and contemplating going up another level after,
when suddenly

"The Sioux have launched their spaceship."
Er... who?  They haven't done anything all game except say hi once in
a while.  Ok, spend the next few turns making nice so someone will
share maps with me so  I can find the Sioux and storm them... 

OMIGOD they've got more land than the five of us put together, and
they're on the other side of the world!

First ever space race loss.
