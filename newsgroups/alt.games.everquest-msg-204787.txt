Berg does a good job explaining this except that you should consider a
few things about PoJ that make it different than some other zones. 
Like most zones, aggro radius in PoJ is effected player level.  But
unlike other zones, social aggro is reduced to zero for lower level
mobs with a high enough player level.  That is how level 58, 59, 60,
etc... players can walk out in the halls and fight anything they want
without aggroing anything else.  Even a level 57 player can avoid
social aggro on most things in the entry/exit area.

That means that a higher level puller can run out and tag a rat,
guard, or prisoner, and run it back to the group, right through
countless guards, prisoners, and rats, without getting anything other
than his original pull.  However, the puller is usually SOWed and gets
back to camp faster than the pull.  If you aid him in any way while
the pull is still in the halls, it may as well have been your pull. 
Now every rat, guard, and prisoner that his pull passes, will aggro on
you.  Note that in this case, the puller is high enough level that he
doesnt get social aggro, but you are low enough that you do.  So a
horde of rats come in and they will attack only you.  If you zone,
they will attack only other people level <57 or so who also aggroed
the pull and ignore anyone who either a) didnt aggro in any way, or b)
are level 58+ (57 is the gray area).

It's an important rule of thumb in any case...never heal or buff the
puller until the pull shows up.  But in PoJ it is especially important
because pulls are almost guaranteed to be running through other social
MOBs.

Other rules for PoJ when some people are low enough to get social
aggro:

-Never let the pull get back in to the hallways.  Do not let it run,
do not kite it.  If things go bad, zone.  Dont try to snare and root
because you will invetably run the MOB out to where it can find
friends.
-Do not pull past Sralm Noramir unless you are level 58+
-Sentries may not add at level 58 and they will never add at level 59.
-Gaolers still appear to add at level 61
-No rats, including the basement one where the guardians of justice
patrol, will ever aggro at level 59.  Im not sure about level 58.
-While most mobs are social and only aggro when attacked or recruited,
a few are KOS.  If you are exploring, stay away from the KOS mobs.  A
level 55 running around may think he is perfectly safe, until he finds
the tormented wraith cell or a warrior of Ne'Pahwhatever.  He aggros
the KOS...and then everything snowballs from there.
-Finally, if you see someone running around the entry area kiting a
gaoler, guardian, or high guardian of justice, this person is going to
be at least level 58.  It isnt uncommon to see such aggro kiting
because you can get pretty good exp, killing MOBs even higher level
than you are, by running them around shooting them, dotting them,
sending the pet on them, nuking them, or having a friend do damage. 
There are a few problems with this however.

The first is that if your puller pulls past one of these aggro kiters,
he will have aggro from that point until the level 60 high guardian of
justice is dead.  This means that if the aggro kiter dies, the high
guardian of justice will be coming after your puller next.  If you are
fighting at the time he arrives, he will try to wipe your entire group
and he wont have much trouble doing it, hitting for around 450...

The second is that if your puller is not high enough level to avoid
aggro from everything that the high guardian my pass, the aggro kiter
will start aggroing mobs on your puller as he passes mobs in the
hallways.  Your group could be sitting doing nothing.  Your level 57
puller has not got aggro on anything other than a high guardian of
justice that is being aggro kited.  But then things go wrong.  The
aggro kiter pulls his high guardian past sralm noramir just has he
repops.  The aggro kiter doesnt get aggro, your puller does.  Next
thing you know, your puller is being attacked by Sralm Noramir for
apparently no reason.
