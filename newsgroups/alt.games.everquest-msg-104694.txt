Exactly, so you have a porter to get you close, and most likely you'll
be running across with a couple others.  The original complaint was
about how hard it is to travel across CS by an uberguild cleric.

They didn't aggro me this past weekend.  On multiple crossings.  You
are right about the stun though, I used to die regularly there until I
got my 53 mez.  Do you swim over or under?  I've had better luck with
swimming below them, but it's not perfect.
Sometimes the 3rd one aggros, but he can't do enough damage to keep me
from getting over the falls.

Arolpin
who also has a DA, and will most likely die crossing SG the very next
time he attempts in some nifty karmic bitchslap
