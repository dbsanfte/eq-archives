Well, people from many countries died in the incident and the attack was
designed, presumably, to cripple the world stock markets and world trading.
Oil prices rose from $4 to $28 a barrel for example and the Bank of Japan
and European Central Bank plowed around $80billion into the financial system
to stop the US going into a recession. Terrorism is a plight of the world,
not just the USA on September 11th.

No, but cruise missiling the crap out of them isn't the answer. Part of the
reason the Far East hates the USA is the way it treats them and sorting out
that situation, as well as military action, would be much more effective.
World terrorism to the USA is only the Far East and that's a load of BS.

Hardly, but then nothing matters unless it directly affects the United
States, right?

That was an invasion of a British colony and very different to the
afghanistan situation.
