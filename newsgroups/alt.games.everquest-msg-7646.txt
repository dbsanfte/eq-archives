    Bring along a friend with Sneak if you can. There's goblin merchants in
both Runnyeye and Sol A that can have the ore on them - the Runnyeye vendor
has it quite frequently. Also be sure to check the gnome vendors in Sol A.
The vendors in High Keep ALSO usually have some, especially the vendors near
the mines.
