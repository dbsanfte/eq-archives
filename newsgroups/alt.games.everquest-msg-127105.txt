At 54, I can cast on a wyvern right as a drake flys over it and it'll leave
me alone (well, except Azureake/Yvolcarn), I know I could do this at 52, and
I couldn't at 49 and 50.

Indeed, unless you have a LOT of mana (like 255 wis + 300 mana and level 47
or higher), I tried back at 47 to quad (test run on one wyvern with 4 snares
and using aoe), got it to about 25% from full mana before I ran out and
finished it off with warden symbol and bracer dots.
