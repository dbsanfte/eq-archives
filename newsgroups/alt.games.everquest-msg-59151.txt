  It's valid in that creating a situation where you have a tactical
advantage takes effort, cunning, or at very least, friends.  You may get
your advantage by waiting until your opponent is in a vulnerable position,
or by getting your friends together to attack a character, similar to
mounting a raid.  Yes, there are roving bands of hooligans in PvP games, but
there are always going to be "griefers" in any game you play who are out to
upset your time... even in non-PvP worlds.  Losing and dying in most PvP
environments is far from being the end of the world, anyway.  It's the "fair
fights" that make the game exciting, the situations where you escape,
survive or even win against bad odds.  All fights might not be fair... heck,
not even MOST fights might be fair in that both sides are even, but what
does it matter if you enjoy yourself during the "fair fights" and are able
to detach yourself enough to realize it's a game, and if you get ganked it's
a minor setback, not a major blow.  It may require more patience than some
people seem to have, but that's the price you pay for being able to pit
yourself against an actual, living, breathing, thinking foe, instead of a
mostly static environmental that provides a mostly static challenge.
