I've seen a number of monks soloing.  I've only seen one warrior soloing, 
and he was pretty frustrated.  I have never seen a rogue attempting to 
solo, though they sometimes do fine in two person groups.  

If you mentioned fungi tunics and other regen options like choosing a race 
that regenerates, I didn't see it.  Seems to me if you pick a class that 
has fewer hit points you'd get better mileage out of regen.
