You know, what gets me about this isn't the blatent stupidity of trying to
buy someone else's character, but the complete disregard for usenet
ettiquite, and common sense.  A small bit of lurking in the group you're
going to post in is considered a "good thing" (TM).  Lurk for two weeks, and
you will see how this group responds to these types of posts.
