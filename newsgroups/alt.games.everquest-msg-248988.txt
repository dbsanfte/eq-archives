1)remove the no drop flag from all loot.
2)add graveyards and bindable spots to god zones.
3)set monk defensive ability lower than a warriors and higher than a rogues.
4)remove the essence emerald from necro res.
5)add crappy resses to shamans.
6)nerf beastlord clarity buffs (sd, paragon etc) from clarity atk to regen
atk.
7)change groups from max 6 people to max 8 people rebalancing instances.
8)remove the necessity to farm to enter any zone, raid encounters are fine
but not if they must be triggered by countless hours of work(veeshans peak,
vex thal, smith rondo ) kill mob is plenty no bullshit needed
9)flag accounts not characters, the first time is fun the rest is just make
work.
10)add the expedition functionality to ldons.

For expansions !

The expansion I liked the best was LDON . Try to figure out what you did
right with that one and do it again. I liked POP as well.
