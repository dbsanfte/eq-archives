The one I saw was walking along by the path. Could have been a return to
spawn point after someone tried to PL using him. For the purposes of getting
killed by a mob, the method he got onto the path or the reason he was
wandering is not really important.

Just last night I got killed by Chief Boonda<?> the ogre from the ogre camp,
about 5 seconds after zoning into WK. Someone had trained him all the way to
the zone line. I know he doesn't wander, it didn't make a difference. I just
don't like the formula: Dozens of people running through a zone using SoW or
Selo's and narrow zone exits. That would probably be a better way of putting
it.

IMO: It depends on the direction you are taking. If you are going from MT to
Gorge, you are fine because you have a short run with the high level mobs at
the end.

If you are going from the Gorge to MT, then you have several ~level 20 mobs
that will aggresso on you as soon as you enter and pound you pretty good all
the way through.
