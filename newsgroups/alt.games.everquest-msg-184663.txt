I have Velious and Kunark running (trilogy) I have SoL but obviously
it's not going to do me any good. Problem is I'm just a hair under
what I should be running IMHO, not lagging slow or anything, and I
found out today that grouping is totally unacceptable, especially in
Unrest, my favorite haunts. I wonder if it is a lack of memory, I
brought it up to 256 megs today an still dragging a**.
