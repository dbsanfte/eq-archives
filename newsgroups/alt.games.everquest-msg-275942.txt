Those that started earlier probably are there. I would definitely be
there, if not for the fact that I started a char in Freeport up to 19,
then I gave up trying to like the city (my guild decided to be based
there) and created a new char in Qeynos, when he was lvl 31 the rest of
my guild decided they didn't like Freeport and created new chars in
Qeynos, so I created a new char to play with them.
Then when this new char got to 27, my guild mates (the ones in Qeynos)
stopped playing for RL issues, so I started crafting, when this char go
to about 28 alchemist, SOE released the patch of doom (as it is known
for alchemists), so I created yet another char for crafting, this one a
sage, and now he's lvl 26.
If I had stayed with one char from the beginning he'd most probably be
40+ (if not 50)
