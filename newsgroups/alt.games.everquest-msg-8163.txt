 Please do that and let us know will you? I'm this close to going in
there and grabbing a pair but if the effect is only equal to JBoots
I'll simply stick to SOW potions. Frankly, I think that JBoots are 
the MOST over-rated item in the game. It's so annoying running with
somebody with JBoots when I have SOW, JBoots are quite slow if you 
ask me. Way too slow. Good for newbies (who can't actually get them
usually without high level help) but a death sentence to a level 40+
trying to get away from a MOB on their butt.
 
 If Traveler's Boots are same as JBoot speed I'll pass.
