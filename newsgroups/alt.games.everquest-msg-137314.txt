That is true about hardware modems vs. winmodems. However, I used a hardware
modem and still got knocked off a lot.
My solution? Broadband baby!! Now I NEVER, EVER go linkdead or get booted
off! It's sweet! I highly recommend it if you have the means. DSL is fine
too but IMHO, broadband is better (for lots of technical reasons).
The bottom line here is that if you have a modem, any sort of dial up type
connection, you are GOING to get logged off. Sorry.
