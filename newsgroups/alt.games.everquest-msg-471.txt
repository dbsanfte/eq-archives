I have a few things that I've been wondering about and need to know. I'm
sure there are others I have forgotten here, but this is what I can think of
at the moment.

1)  Can you heal while running from mob?
2)  Should I sell my leather padding and silk threads and silk cord and silk
swatch or put in bank for later?
3a)  Can you gate out of battle?
3b)  If so can you do it while running from the mob?
4)  Why do I seam to interrupt my spells if I move while casting? (like
trying to heal myself while running for my life)

Thanks.
