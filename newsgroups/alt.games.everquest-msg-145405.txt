Since I was the poster, I believe I know what I was talking about.

I'll say it agian.  Warriors add some decent damage.    If you want a
different answer for compared to what... Pal (non-undead), SK, Cleric,
Shaman, Enchanter, Mages, Beastlords, Bards...  I'll say can probably
compete with the Necro, since I don't know all that much about how much
damage they output. (and they generally can't use a pet.)  Druid, possibly?

Hell, thats over half the classes in the game right there.

Of course, if we listend to you we wouldn't have had 5 or 6 warriors there
to begin with.   Two maybe...

Nope, not always.  One of the hazards of raiding with the public.

Second string can still mean first string from thier respective guilds.

Please show me where I said that it would be beneficial to the raid to
*replace* a rogue with a warrior.


As for how often a warrior way down the tank list (or not on it) can save
the day... well, I've done it twice so far, and I haven't been raiding all
that long.  (Not counting epic fights and planar stuff.)

Assuming you have an infinite number of each class to choose from, and
litmited raid spots, yes.

For our raids it generally goes the other way.  (And while we are reaching
full capacity more often, we still do not have the luxury of picking and
chosing each individual class.)

Well, goodie goodie for you.

You make up a quick list of the AE taunt warriors there, and decide prior to
the fight which of them should do so.    You watch for who has died and who
is still alive.  If you're up next you do it.  If the person or two before
you is up, but is either sleeping or dead, you call for aggro, wait a second
so heals can begin, and let it rip.

And what do you think this is....  hmm... could it be communicating with the
clerics to let them know who is going for aggro?  The exact thing you
suggest?

Assuming it's not already chewing through the clerics....

Yep, you've tanked more big encounters than me, and you obviously do it with
a better trained raid force.  That doesn't mean it's not an issue for most
people out there.
