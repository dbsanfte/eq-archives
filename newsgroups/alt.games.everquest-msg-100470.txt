Sheesh, the reason i kept it  was cuz it was funny, not cuz it was all good
advice.  I DO know the difference, no need to tell people not to group with
me, I have enough trouble being a ranger as it is.  In clarification, I
always take off around 10% of my mana when I tell the group how much I have.
If I'm having trouble keeping enough to last through one fight in a partner
situation, I just tell him i'm going AFK for a few and med up all the way.
Mostly my mana isn't considered a good enough reason to hold pulls but
they'd have a hard time without my snare, or my nice 200+DOT I got at 30. So
go jump in the lake!
