   Yes, I can see how that might make things a bit more hectic.  I told Lenny of
this problem, and he wonders if perhaps in addition to shipping the customer
service to India they also now have low paid third world employee's in a big
warehouse somewhere in India or the Philippines or something filled with PC's
and people whose job it is to control the NPC's.  They'd get a 2 cent bonus for
ever PC they kill.  
     Switching to real intelligence for the MoBs instead of that crappy AI stuff
we're used to would certainly do more for making the high end game "interesting"
for ubar guilds than adding more and more raid expansions.
