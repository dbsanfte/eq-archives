Offer means "I want as much as I can get for it. How much do you want it?"
5k is a good price on a lammy on Bristlebane, they're 2.5k on your server?
Think I payed 7 for mine...that was sometime ago tho'
If you're looking for a good deal look for the people who are advertising
with price, if someone is selling cheap they'll want people to know that
rather than answer tells asking "how much?"
