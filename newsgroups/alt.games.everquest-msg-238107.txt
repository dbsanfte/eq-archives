Sorry to be dull but have a question I am sure I know but can anyone
confirm.

I have heard that people may have more than one account and use
something called bots. Can they use this from the same machine
assuming they install to different directories, or do they have to use
two machines?

I dont wish to do so one is enough for me - just curious.
