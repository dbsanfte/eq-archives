Some people are just about as lazy and stupid as hell. When ever I see
an idiot asking for stuff like that I just say "you'd be there by
now.. its like 20 feet away." This is akin to in real life if you live
like two buildings over from a store and are outside trying to hitch a
ride to it. 

I even wonder about people in EC begging for tps to lavastorm when
they are moderately high level. My druid tells them "hell if I was
going to lavastorm from here I'D run, you think i'm made of mana you
lazy cuss?"

AAAAAHAH, yeah. For another thing sow is really not even that much
faster than getting somewhere without it unless its a real high level
sow and you have LARGE zones to run across. For example jboots are a
level 9 sow and if you are bored sometime time running from the wc
zone to kithikor to the west freeport gate guards with and without
jboots, I bet the difference is about 3 minutes.

I thought about that but I stuck the scale spells so incredibly far
back in my spell book cause they are more or less worthless that it
would not be worth my trouble to drag them out. The one thing I use
scale for is running from the skyshrine entrance up to the TOV quest
mobs because that is one LONG ASS RUN which takes a while and its
noticibly faster than my regular level 55 sow.
