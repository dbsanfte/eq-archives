Druids do fine on raids.  They backup heal.  They nuke.  They buff.
They debuff.  Are they really NEEDED?  No probably not.  But neither
are rangers, mages, necros, or paladins[1].  There are specialist
classes that do what these classes do, just MUCH BETTER.  Same for
druids.  

Clerics are the best healers because that's pretty much all they get
to do.  Druids can heal adequately.  There are a few small tweaks they
could have made, but give us CH isn't one of them.

The most frightening aspect of all this is, if they plan on giving
druids and shaman pseudo-CH, exactly how tough are the PoP mobs gonna
be?

[1] Note:  I am not saying there aren't places where these classes
don't excel.  Mages in CoH leap immediately to mind.  But generally
speaking, they aren't the end all classes for what they do.  Not that
any of them can't bring a whole ton of mob killin goodness to a raid.
