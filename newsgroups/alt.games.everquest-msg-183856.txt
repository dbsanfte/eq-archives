Yes you can do it with both.  Just drag the 'slot' or 'icon' over to 
your hotkey box.  Press 1 and box 1 will cast, 2 and box 2 will cast, 
etc etc.  Hot keys are set up like this:

1 2
3 4
5 6
7 8
9 0

You can also instead of having the spell icon there, make your own 
button that casts the spell.  The same as the old auctions people used 
to use.  Drag an empty hotkey over to the slot(i forget the name of the 
place where these are kept), name the box, then type /cast <numbered 
spell slot>.  These are based off your spell icons (1-8) that you 
memorise.  So it would look like this e.g.

Name of Button: CH
Instructions inside button: /cast 6
			    /g Casting comlete Heal on %t

%t being the target name in your target box.

Not a very good explanation, but I hope it helps.
