Hmmmmmmm   Very good question...

Just *MY* personal opinion only, you understand..  I feel that, IN SA
where the Muppet is going to be turned loose, their reasoning is
twofold.  I believe that PART of the reason is the tolerance issue.
(Note that my claim that it is NOT about tolerance applies to the
United States only) But I honestly and truly believe that the biggest
part of the release in SA is because the government in SA has a real
national emergency when it comes to AIDs and they are trying ANY way
and EVERY way they can to combat it.  I predict that the HIV Muppet in
SA will try to "scare" people (kids and adults alike) into better
sexual habits.

Again, that's just MY personal opinion..

Now, let's address the issue of WHY those in power would want to bring
it to the US...  That's an easy one..

To play to the Loony Left and the Ultra PC crowd, of course...  :^)
