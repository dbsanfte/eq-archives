A good rule of thumb is that the lowest level character must
be at least 2/3rds the level of the highest level character.  This
has some blips at very low levels... but the easy way to
find out is to join the group and kill something.  If you get the
"party experience" message, you are good to go.

Here's the basic plan:  exp is carved up based on your level.
Thus, everyone in a group levels up at the same rate.  If
a level 10 groups with a level 15 for an hour, both will
advance a bubble or so, all things being equal.

What is good about this?  Well, for the high level, you should
actually see -more- exp off of a given mob than you would
grouped with someone of your level, assuming your new
teammate is still capable of helping you with the kill at the
same rate.

For the lower level, you should see access to substantially
better loot than you would killing things at your own level.

An excellent team for basic combat, for example, would
be a 15 warrior and a 10 cleric.  The cleric should be
capable of emergency healing in a combat, but more importantly
-drastically- reducing the resting and healing time between
combats.   The warrior should be seeing almost as many kills
as he would with a level 15 cleric... which is to say 10 times
as many as he would on his own.  The cleric should be
seeing about the same kill count as he would grouped with
a level 10 warrior, but with much better loot.
