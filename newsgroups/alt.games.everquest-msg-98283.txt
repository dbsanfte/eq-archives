Yeah, but "how much fun" is a kind of arbitrary thing.  If we're
talking about the best tactics to use, I think efficiency is something
to consider.  I was beating on fleeing mobs until 49, when my 1HB
finally maxed out and frankly, after doing it for 49 levels it was
getting pretty damned tedious to me.  Particularly since it took me
better than a minute, maybe two to finally kill whatever I was
smackin'.

If you enjoy it, by all means wail-away.  Doesn't mean I'm going to
agree with you though.  :-)
