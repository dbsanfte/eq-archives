I verbally berate clerics that overwrite my Pot9.  Damn spell costs 725 mana
to cast.

Ancient: Aegolism (cleric) - 1300 hp

Virtue (cleric) - 1405 hp

Kazad (cleric) - 910 hp
Pot9 (druid) - 618 hp + 8 mana regen

Fot7 (shaman) stacks with all these setups for an additional 544 hp and some
melee stats (str/dex).

Now, keep in mind some classes have self buffs that give mana regen that
doesn't stack with some other spells.

For example, a cleric has Armor of the Zealot, 450 hp + 8 mana regen, it
stacks with Virtue, but not Pot9, so going with pot9+kazad they can't use
AotZ, BUT, AotZ doesn't stack with Fot7 either, so they lose out on that hp.

Virtue + AotZ = 1855 hp + 8 mana regen
Pot9 + Kazad + Fot7 = 2072 hp + 8 mana regen

The Pot9 combo comes out ahead by far.

I forget what other classes have self buffs with stacking issues other than
paladins, whose Aura of the Crusader buff with Virtue is generally better
than the other option. AotC is 345 hp (might be off by 1 or 2), and 3 mana
regen, but doesn't stack with Pot9, and unlike AotZ, DOES stack with Fot7.

Virtue + AotC + Fot7 = 2294 hp + 3 mana regen : they sacrifice the 5 mana
regen (not usually a big deal for hybrids) for over 200 more hp (big plus
for melee classes).

This only deals with the highest level of 60+ buffs though.  Lower level
buffs the cleric self buff (baotr or ancient high priests bulwark) and
aego/boa/ancient aego is definitely superior, though for other classes potg
+ marzin is superior to non ancient aegolisms.
