Yes, very much different. 80 people there last time I checked a few
nights ago. /ooc bickering, childish jokes, d00dz, etc. Training,
KSing, more bickering.

However, turn the /ooc off and find a nice spot in the mountains and
it's a good place to be. Got Kahir through his early 40's there nicely
before taking advantage of his claw's bane vs Sonic Wolves up in
Tenebrous.
