    Ayup. A lot of guilds are about to drop a tier, and they will not be
happy about it. And the guilds like my own get to preserve their
"top-of-the-heap" status for longer as people try and make up for the
problem.

    Some fights are like that. Some are not. The difference is encounter
design. You can tell where thought was put in as to how to keep people
engaged, and where a_random_boss01 was just plunked into place. Unless they
actually change the mob abilities or the area around the fight, they haven't
made things more interesting. They've just increased the need for support
classes.
