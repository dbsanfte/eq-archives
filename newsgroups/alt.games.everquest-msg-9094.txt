Cool! You ever try making mead? That's what we brew primarily, though
we've done beer as well.  You simply can't buy any good mead outside of
England, but making your own, particularly with a variety of fruit bases
and experimenting with different yeasts, is really interesting and tasty.
(Not to mention that when you use champagne yeast you get an alcohol
content about four times that of any store bought table wine.WOO.)
