What is this?  Runneyeye before the goblins took over or something?

Added with and for GoD.  May not be in, though it was opened to all
with the expansion.  Tough to tell.

Will just be E & W FP.

As someone already mentioned, merged and doesn't exist.

Might be since it isn't expansion-specific, but seems out of place.

Doubt this will be in there.  This isn't "Lower Guk".

Also not expansion-specific but it sure would be out of place and I'm
not sure you can even get the mission until the group average reaches
60 or so.

Monster Mission, won't be in.

I thought they said that on the SoE boards.  I could be wrong and would
not be a bit surprised if there were no PoK.  Still, how many people
today with their cushy take on EQ would be unable to deal with a game
where you have to travel for an hour before you actually group?

Interesting question: Can you name which mob must be defeated to open
each expansion?

Naggy and Vox.
Kunark: Trakanon?  Or do you get in to Veeshan's Peak?  Or is that
possible since it was "upgraded"?
What do you kill in Velious?  Vindi?  Wake the Sleeper?  Kill
everything in NTOV?
Luclin: Emp?  Or would they need to take out Seru as well?  Or
something in Vex Thal?
PoP: Quarm.
What do you kill in LDON?  Is there even a progression in the raids?
LoY: I guess the gimp version of Innoruuk?  Or which ever evil god is
in LoY?  Will they bother requiring people to unlock this?
GoD:  something with lots of consonents and very few vowels in his
name.
OoW: Mata Muram
DoN: Vish and whatever the other dragon was.
DodH: this is obvious.
PoR: no clue.
