Well, we were sharing the camp.  Its just Mezzmer decided to charm our kills
to use as his pet to fight in HIS battles.  I love having an orc targetted
and unloading a few bubbles of mana on it before realizing that its not
being hurt and that the main tank is losing health to a bunch of other orcs
I can't help kill.
