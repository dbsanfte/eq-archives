Yeah... I probably would quit.  It's bad enough there's 
Ebay/playerauctions/what-have-you... Verant endorsing it, I think, would 
rather quickly change the nature of the game to something I wouldn't 
enjoy.

I have no issue with something like Chimp & Gimp, but having a steady 
influx of people whose primary characters are high-level newbies... 
*shudder*.
