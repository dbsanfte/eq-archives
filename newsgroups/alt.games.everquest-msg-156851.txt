Problem:
How to market a less than well received expansion for a game nearing
its end of life stage? Problem is complicated by an ever decreasing
customer satisfaction index with existing product.

Solution:
Cripple (balance) the existing game to the point where players must
purchase the expansion to return to previously accustomed levels of
play. Include enough new incentives to create a desire for the
expansion while at the same time effectively isolating any player that
doesn't have the expansion.

Suggestions:
Alienate players from each other by creating as much tension though
class jealousy as possible. Focus expected player dissatisfaction away
from the product itself, ideally it would be directed toward other
players.  This would be combined with the balancing described above
and designed to cause as much disorder and interest as is feasible. If
not carried out properly a severe backlash may occur endangering
future projects. 

Sound familiar to you?
