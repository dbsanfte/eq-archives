Whilst druids may be admirable soloers, they certainly lack raiding
usefulness in any numbers.

Best way to make this chance targeted at the weak spot (raids) rather
than further enhancing their strengths (soloing, small groups) would be
to make the heal use a small, easily accessibly component. Throw a 2pp
gem into the mix and it becomes a use-when-needed spells rather than a
global power increase.
