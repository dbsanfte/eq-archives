    Ah, hang on on the FV community forums, do you?

    The incident Thomas refers to is one where a cleric joined a group doing a
LDoN, then charge 400 plat in advance per  90% rez after a party wipe... then
"forgot" to rez one member can couldn't be bothered to come back and do the
deed, so just kept the money and put the person on ignore.

   I find this shocking on a couple of different levels.  One, clerics are
taking a bit of a beating as a whole in the FV community right now; we do _not_
need an asshat like this giving people a legitimate reason to hate the cleric. 
Secondly, this came as a surprise to almost everyone.  As far as I could tell,
no one had ever heard of person before.  With people skills like this, I would
expect that this person would be at the very top of the rants forum every time
she grouped.  Thirdly, where the hell did she find a group that was willing to
submit to this kind of black-mail?  When she joined the group, she greeted them
by saying something to the effect of "Hihi my niggarz!" and used L33t 5pe4k the
whole time she was grouped.  On FV, at least, this is something of a rarity.  Of
course, what she did wasn't really begging.  It was extortion and thieving, but
not blackmail.

   And no, I didn't track her down.  I tend to be like dishwashing soap, gentle
and mild.  But there are many that read those forum who are not.
