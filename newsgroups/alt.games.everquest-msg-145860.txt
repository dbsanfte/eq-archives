Bravo.

I have Tiru (my cleric) parked conveniently for rezzing my party already.
And the wizzie ports us where ever. Now to just find two more necros, and
convince Rosana to play with us a lot more often. =). As for my rezzes, I
think I'll have to start handling my own. Besides, Tiru can only do a 90
rez, and I do 93. Why pester the dwarf?

Of course the wizzie doesn't have tracking, but he does the best he can.

My thoughts on the patch...

ooo an improvement to the Spectre pet. Can't wait.

Hoobah! DoTs stack!

May need to find another great XP spot, since everyone and their nephew will
want to hunt in SF. We've been grinding here, and it's been good to us. Not
sure how many mobs will be up later this evening. But this may cut the
backlog, and I may consider a. hunting with Tiru again, and b. getting his
clicky. Even though I've been unemployed for too long now, I still didn't
want to put in the time to camp that.

It's about frigging time they added these petition commands. As a former gui
de, I'm sure the entire guide community is praising Verant right now.

Yeah! dingah noise! And, I was 54 just as the patch hit- I squeeked in. =).

"Shadowknight and Necromancer Drain type spells can now be clicked off by
the recipient of the beneficial portion of the spell. " I'm guessing that
the caster will still have the negative effect however.

"Death Peace made available to Necromancers at level 60" what the heck is
this?

"For spells that require Line of Sight (LoS), the LoS check is now at the
beginning of the spellcast, not the end." I can't say how much I love this.

"Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl has been given a minor upgrade." I want to
know what this is.

"Updated the /note window. The old /note <text> command still works as it
always has. But you can now use /note without additional text to produce a
text window for entering note text. The /note command window should not
break existing skins." I also love this. I often write while online. Here's
a chance to edit what I do. =) And actually take note on that quest i'm
doing right now. =)

Merchants now display up to 80 items in their inventory. I am a shopper.
Thank you.
