}can't), join them.

So okay, lets try a little metaphor here.  Assume it's not EQ, but some 
simpler, less complicated game.  Like chess.  (Ok, I know chess nuts who 
would argue that. :) )  Now, suppose you're happily playing a game in the 
cafe with someone, you're winning, and you get down to the endgame.  He 
reaches in his back pocket and puts a couple more rooks on the board.  
Now, do you think you'd just sit back and say, "oh, that's okay, it's only 
a game, rules don't matter that much?"  or do you think you'd ask him to 
please stop putzing around?

Half the point of a game is that it has rules that have been agreed to by 
the players.  That's sort of where the fun part comes from, for me, at 
least.  So yes, when people go "outside the normal scope of the game and 
do better than me", I'm liable to get a little bent.  It's not even so 
much about the "do better than me".  It's about disrespecting the game.

Now, if we agreed beforehand that since I was a ranked player and he 
wasn't, that he could drop a rook or two on the board whenever he wanted, 
that'd be a different matter. :)
