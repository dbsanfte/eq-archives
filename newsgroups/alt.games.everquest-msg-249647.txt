I read things on this newsgroup, see the /ooc auction messages and
look at the prices in the Bazaar and it seems like a lot of people
have unfathomable (to me) amounts of money.  My main is a level 18
Necro and I have about 150 plat most of which I received as a gift
from a friend who was level 50.  I have no magical items other than my
newbie armour and some items that my friend bought for me in the
Bazaar.

My question is when does the money start rolling in?  Is my position
typical of (non-twinked) level 18 characters or am I doing something
wrong?  Where do people get magical stuff at my level and what should
my bank balance be?

Steve
