Wrong actually. The important thing is the license. In the music
example, the license is tied to the item. When the item is transferred
to the new owner, the license is transferred at the same time. Applying
this to EQ, the license is explicitly granted to the original user, and
explicitly prohibits the transfer of that license under any
circumstances. You can't even give it away, let alone sell it.

The license doesn't come from buying the box at the store, as it does
with music. The license comes when you first subscribe to EQ. That is
where you agree to everything, enter your single-use key code, and
electronically sign the EULA which among other things, details your
license for the product. As the license explains, it is granted to that
one person, is non-transferrable, and remains to property of VI.

Here's an example: Train tickets.

Dunno about the US, but in the UK we have a ticket called a 'One Day
Travelcard'. This allows you unlimited travel on all trains, buses and
tubes in and around London for a day by buying a single ticket. If you
try and sell your ticket to someone else after you've used it, you will
be fined. Sure, people hand the tickets off to friends sometimes, and
the travel operators see it as an unregulatable area, and turn a blind
eye. However, if you stand outside the station, trying to publicly sell
it to strangers, you can bet your ass they'll fine you for it.
