Hello friends,

I recently got a new laptop that plays EQ decent.  Here is my dilemma.  I
cannot update the drivers for the NVidia Geforce 4 Go card.

It is showing a driver of 4.7.1.6 with a date of 04/2004

I tried to install 61.77 over the driver's with no luck, when I restart it
always goes back to 47.16

In my programs menu I am showing:

NVidia GART Driver ( which I tried to uninstall with the same results)
NVidia WinXP/2000 Drivers ( I know from prior mistakes not to delete these)

My only problem I am having is some missing ground and walls in PoK thus
far.  I have not seen it in other zones yet.  The ground seems to be white
and the walls are just missing.

Also could these be an advanced graphics issue??

i.e Turning of Vertex Shaders or Pixel whatever 1.0 or 2.0

Thanks from the
Innoruuk Server
