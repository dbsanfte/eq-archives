You're on!

I have 10 bucks says a smithed item with around 185 trivial.

Don't think they would make the 9th coldain shawl available only to
gnomes.  And the pattern so far has been to make the character
recieving the reward go through the tedium of mastering the trade
skill.  Although some of the earlier shawls are multi-questable, I
think they've learned from their mistakes.
