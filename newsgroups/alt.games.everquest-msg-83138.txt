I'm beginning to see the problem with our communications, and I
apologize. I thought at first that just a refresher on aggro management
and hate list dynamics was called for. Apparently I skipped over reading
comprehension. You left most, if not all, of my text in your response.
Can you show me the spot again where I said "need"? Oh, what's that? You
can't? Ah! That would be because I didn't. However, by your attempt to
twist that logic, then as long as my armor is sufficient, I can go pick
out the two slowest, lowest damage rusty weapons in the game and use
them on a level sixty mob, and I'll do my job of holding aggro just as
well, eh?

What's that? No? AH! So the light comes on. More is better where you can
afford more. Less is *not* better. Glad this is coming through.
Maximizing damage inflicted and the speed of hits landing maximises your
position on the hate list. No, you don't sacrifice other aspects of the
tanking job *ONLY* for raw damage, but when reasonable, you take the
most you can get.

Again, your interpretation of my, admittedly, limited attempts to
communicate in writing boggle the mind. Where, in that sentence, did you
get an implication that I had "outleveled" you, if one could outlevel a
sixty? Nevermind. You didn't get that. You write too well to be *that*
clueless. Why you would type it is a question for the ages.

May be a server difference thing, and if so, beyond my knowledge so I
apologize for the misunderstanding. I've yet to run into a cleric *that*
bad who lived to see the post fifty game. But I may have just been
lucky.

Indeed a terminology thing, I guess. Sorry. We refer to the MA/SA/Tank
Mezzer folks as the tanks, and the rest as "melee". But I can see how
casters could think on anyone who's not a pure caster as "tanks". Either
way, that's cleared up. Let's move on.

Not at all! As *both* of us have tried to point out, it's a <game>. You
should play it how you enjoy it. If you don't like the roll of cleric in
big raids at the high end, you'd be foolish to do it. Hell, we have a
druid posting here who's worked almost exclusively on melee skill maxing
and getting her AC as high as possible and obtaining the best ratio
weapons. Might be odd, but as long as she's having fun, viva la
differance. Same for you or anyone else.

And on this point, at least, we shall agree. Some people just like
soloing their druid to sixty and never talking to anyone. Nothing wrong
with that either. If helping a guildmate get a better item which will
benefit both themself and the guild, and improve their power for the
next group goal is a "waste of your time" then by all means you are
doing the right thing. Nobody can force group goals on you, and you are
exercising that right. I salute you. You don't owe *anyone* your help,
allegiance, or teamwork. You pay your ten bucks a month like the rest of
us. March to your own drummer, tiny dancer! :-)

I apologize. I was not clear. I should have fully spelled out "... don't
like your choice of class when given their typical position in high end
guilds who raid a lot."  You are completely correct.

Again, you don't do a lot of melee, so I guess I can see how you would
think that. And you state you don't want to "waste your time" helping
anybody else in a large scale group effort, so I *suppose* I can put
myself in the hypothetical position to see how you'd think it was ok to
not attack during a raid, or see it as pointless, etc.  Not that I'd do
it, but again... you pay your ten bucks too.

This goes back to "sorry you don't like the role of [xxx] in raids.."
blah blah blah. Clerics are the heart and blood of raids. You find it
boring so you don't do it. To each, as they say, their own. Just glad
not everyone who professes to "love being a cleric" feels that way, or
nobody would have ever set foot in ToV or Sleepers to this day.

I got it before, and get it more now. Not a team player. Check. Let's
move on.

Exactly. See above. You can fight low blues all the way to sixty. Many
do. Others wonder what loot the designers put on the AoW. You're not

Speaking of thick skulls........ :-) You are the *only* one who said
"need". You'll continue to ignore the value of trying to *maximize*
taunt and be as *high* as possible on the hate list, sadly, since to do
otherwise wouldn't support your (for lack of a better word) "point".

Then you should know that if you are doing Krups, Juggs, etc. you are in
a different part of the zone, with different wanderers, adds, etc. and
the MA will behave differently. Which part of "situational tools" didn't
you catch?

Ah! So the cleric who wants to bitch about being told to only "sit on
their ass and heal" is now going to toe the company line? I'm simply....
SHOCKED! Yes, when the pulling is going easy, or (and listen very
carefully here, even though I've already said it before) in very
minimalist groups, with no snarer especially, sometimes somebody has to
END the fucking fight before the death march mob makes it to their
buddies. Some run faster than others. Even a cleric's nukes can do that,
providing they don't run so LOM that we can't start again. And in
minimalist groups, sometimes that means waiting on the next pull and
*gasp* sitting and chatting with your friends. (Hrmmm.. somebody else
recently extolled the virtues of that here... I only wish I could
remember who.)

Oh, yes. That sounds *MUCH* more fun than a raid. LOL. We do that
plenty, James. The group that we had running when you were shooting me
/tells actually had a sixty *wizard* pulling. We had  three to four
lined up waiting at a time. However, the killing was so efficient, Tiru
was nuking out of boredom. It happens.

Different people, different experiences I suppose. All the clerics on
our guild seem to swap out various spells quite a bit. Particularly on
raids. Not so much in slower, friendly xp grinds of course, except
during buff cycles.

No doubt you've learned a lot. But you are, IMO, bailing in a sinking
ship here. You've layed out very nicely the two different, basic xp
group scenarios: Slow, primarily single pull groups in a dungeon where
you know all the static and roving mobs well with lots of time for
friendly BSing, and fast moving, constant pull xp groups.
[And if you snip everything else and answer nothing else from this, I'd
really like to see your answer to this part, should it please you to.]

You're only reason for your *original* point of not wanting to ever have
tanks throw off a (see topic line) Mighty Strike is that you're pissed
off that they want to "have some fun" when you percieve that you aren't
allowed to. Then you try to back it up with a lame rationale.

First scenario.. the slow group. Letting the tank go low and use a "show
off" disc. Does what? Builds additional aggro (even if you don't
*really* need it), does extra damage, maximizes efficiency of mana use,
(most bang for the buck on each CHeal), let's the tank "have some fun",
and leaves more mana for the cleric to "have some fun". 

Not letting the tank go low and "show off"? Pisses off tank and makes
you feel better about being poorly treated. And if there *IS* a sudden
extra add you didn't anticipate *JUST* as the cleric's about to cast
CHeal on the low tank? The cleric ducks, throws off a Remedy to buy
enough health/time, and still throws the Cheal.

Second scenario... the fast xp group. Letting the tank go low and "show
off". Does what? Maximises aggro (which is now *more* important) does
extra damage, and maximizes efficiency of healing mana (which you need
even *more* now). At this point nobody is having fun. You're griding.

Not letting the tank go low? You're blowing CHeal mana when your MA
still has a thousand HP left. Nice. But you still feel better because at
least he's not having any fun.

Never yet. Monks or me 99% of the time, depending on group. Even wizards
in a wierd one like the other night. Oh, and of course bards, because
*somebody* has to die first. :-)

The MA in a dangerous zone would never do that, or wouldn't be MA long.
You seem fond of quoting the antecdote of our foolish encounter with the
Guardian on Sunday. Refuis was the MA. He spent *one* /disc that day. He
hit defensive when the guardian showed up. So would I have, had I
already been 55 and MA. That's a nasty spot to pull in. Apples and
oarnges. I used Mighty Strike on the Guardian, by the way. At 54 it's
all I had and I was trying to keep as many casters alive as possible for
as long as possible.

I know you said that previously, but I just have to say.. you've not
only gotten stuck hanging around with some crappy clerics, but some
crappy warriors as well. I'd can that warrior fast. If you *have*
defensive, and *refuse* to use it in a case like that, how did you make
it to fifty five?

And yet again, you shouldn't be *always* told to do it when the
"situational tools" allow you to do otherwise. Or, in some cases,
require you to do otherwise. Nor should a warrior *always* be allowed to
"show off and have fun". You just seem bitter about this.

No. See above. It's all situational. And that's why you are wrong. I go
back to your *ORIGINAL* position. That being that you NEVER let a
warrior go low, because they are just "showing off" or "trying to have
fun" and nobody ever let you do that.

Bitter, bitter, bitter.

Again.. sorry it sucked for you so much. I'll snip the rest as this is
way too long already and it's just repetitions of you tring to twist
things around to imply I said a warrior *needs* Mighty Strike to get
aggro and other nonsense. I hope this cleared this up for you. Good luck
with your new cleric on Xev if you're going to continue playing her. And
regardless of any conversations here, I'll repeat the offer I made you
in GFey. If you need a short term hand with any initial crap, let me
know. I know the first levels can be tedious at times.
