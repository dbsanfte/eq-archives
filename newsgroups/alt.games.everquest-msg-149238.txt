Those are the cream of the crop, the stupidest of the stupid.  There was an
ebay druid on my server who would root bomb wyverns one-by-one because he
died "a milloon[sic] times" otherwise.

I will admit that I died twice in CS though, once because I fell asleep
while killing a wyvern (just shows ya how fun they are) and it ate me, then
a second time when I tried to kill an otter at like level 48 and pulled 2
and the second one ran as fast as me and was hasted and beat me into a pulp
(thx shm buffs).

I wish the sirens would charm though now, instead they just mez me, which is
just annoying.  One time I was just running from the ring to SS uninvis, and
the blam, I'm mezzed on the ramp to SS, I was like "wtf?"  nothing ever
attacked me or anything, just mezzed me, it was wierd.
