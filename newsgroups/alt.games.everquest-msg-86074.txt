No, the purpose of having the items no drop in the first place is so
you can't buy them or price gouge for them. It happens just as you say
in most circumstances, you and a BUDDY each have a piece and quest it
for one of you. That is verant's intention. 

Sometimes people you don't know sell Mqing but it involves you
trusting them, such as mqing jboots.
