Hi,

Yesterday (Friday 07/20) when I logged on, the game patched one of
it's files (I think it was called gequip.s3d).  Then today it just
patched the eqmanual_supplement.doc and eqmanual_supplement.txt.

In both of these cases the message from the previous patch (the
one about the guide program) popped up afterwards.

Did anyone else receive these files?

Just checking.

If so, I wish Verant would always change the patch message after
such things, just to let us know what they are doing.

Many Thanks.

 - Mike Dorr
