I wonder what you'd con to the goblins in warewolf form. (boon of the garou,
enchanter spell) There are tons of mobs that are kos to all the player races
but indifferent to most non player races. Giants and goblins in FM, and the
brownies in lf are examples of this. Being indifferent would be the safest
way to get there imo.
