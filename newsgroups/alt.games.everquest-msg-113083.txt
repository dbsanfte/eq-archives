hi guys well i finally bought everquest by constant nagging of my friends.

and after hard consideration i decided on a half elf paladin so far i have
met really nice people buffing me to crazy levels. but i was wondering im
level 5 now and i have absolutely no equipment only a rusty skimater and i
can only go as far as west of freeport (the next zone to the city) i was
wondering wheres a good place to level as most of the creatures there i
don't get any more exp and the one that do give me xp kill me. i have about
3 plat what would you suggest i do?

im also on brell serilus ( or something like that) server and my name is
Danreydriel (i think when i play for the second time i'll write all these
things down :)

anyway its a pretty cool game hope to see some of you guys online.
