My standard disclaimer: I've never played a druid, but that
sure doesn't stop me from telling others how to play them =)
So real druids, correct my glaring mistakes and stupid
mis-information, please!

I kinda disagree with this. If everybody is SoWed, they all know
that they can run for it if things go pear-shaped. However, with
only the puller SoWed, they'll have to stand their ground =)

If the puller overpulls, he should zone, and then come back to
the group when he's zoned back in. If you get a wandering add,
hey, root-park it.

I heartily recommend this! DS's give lots of bang for the buck, and
*can not be resisted!* Furthermore, I prefer DoTs to nukes, at least
if the mob lives long enough for the dot to work a while...

Story-time: If you want to be a good druid in your mid-20s, do
the opposite of what the following druid did:

[This is a true story, read it and mutter "Dr00d" darkly under your breath]

This happened some time ago, in the Frontier Mountains. I was the
leader of a group stationed right outside the Giant Fort, and we
were happily kicking ar^W^W prodding buttock. This being a pickup
group, one member left, so we invited a druid to replace him.

As time went by, we got a lot of complaints from the druid that
the tumps and whatnot resisted his spells all the time. Well, duh,
they were red to him. I told him he might want to use his mana on
damage shields instead, since these can't be resisted. He continued
to nuke and moan.

Then the puller lost his SoW, and asked the druid to replace it.
And then he asked again. And then a third time. I don't remember
exactly how many times he had to ask, but it gave me some time
to med, so I didn't mind too much.

One time, we got an add. We got trained, IIRC, and of course it was
a brae. These are mean bastards, and hit way hard. Being the cleric,
I did my best, but soon found myself out of mana. I informed the
group of this, and started praying (what else can an OOM cleric do?)
However, no secondary healer stepped up to the plate. As luck would
have it, we all survived, but there was some angry comments directed
at the druid.

Then, some time later, a groupmate had to run an errand to the OT
zoneline, and asked the druid for a SoW, so she might get there and
back faster. The druid refused, saying "I don't want to SoW you,
it's a waste of my mana". My jaw dropped. I asked him "Are you
serious?", and he answered in the affirmative. My jaw dropped again,
and my mouse pointer dropped on the "Disband" button.

OK, this is from my faulty memory, so the exact details might have
been a wee bit different... But all of this did happen.
