I have a nasty feeling it will eventually be "fixed" so that it is no
longer overwritten by others as it is currently but also no longer
stacks (no matter how creative you are) with Call of Earth or perhaps
Call of Predator.

This would mean that Rangers would be the only class to have a level
60 uber dropped spell that fails to improve on the several lower level
spells it was designed to replace.
