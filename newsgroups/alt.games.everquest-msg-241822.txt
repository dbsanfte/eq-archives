What I liked about newbie experiences was playing a Froglok in
Innothule Swamp.  Now I was born with swimming of 125, which is pretty
decent.  Now the fact that skeletons, which reallly don't have much
webbing on their feet or any other part of their bodies, could catch
me in the water.  Sheesh!  Where's the accuracy in that?  I'd imagine
that if Timorous Deep had Stonegrabbers that they could swim better
than a frog too.  heeheehee.
