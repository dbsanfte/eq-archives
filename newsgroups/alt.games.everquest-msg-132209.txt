I do believe that the arbitrary number Sanj suggested was intended to be 
net, not gross.  Ie, total income = cost of full support plus One Meeelyun 
Dollars.

Is $1million a fair estimate for cost of total support?  Assuming that 
wouldn't be releasing priviledged company information ar anything...
