Oh, it is to laugh. Druid quad kiting isn't good? So what classes are
good soloers in your universe then?

Uh, if shamans and druids got CH, would clerics still be the best
healers? Cause that's what you said up there, you understand that?

>2) they are the only pure caster that wears plate armor.

Hooray, raid level mobs use 12 seconds instead of 8 to grind them to
a paste. And, oh look, is CH a high-agro spell, you think? Naaw...

>3) they have the most usefull and widest ranging invulnerability spells.

Ok, they have two. DA and DB. DB is the "upgrade" to DA, with double
the casting time, and otherwise works exactly like it. But useful?
The only use they have in everyday encounters is to lower agro and
allow the cleric to live for 18 more seconds. And how is DA + DB more
useful than necros with Quivering Veil and Harmshield? Meanwhile,
bards have Kazumi's note of Preservation, which DAs the *group*, and
has a much lower recast time. Who has the best DA now?

Judgement
Decrease Hit Points (HP) by 925 (L56)

Pushes Target Back: 1 feet

2.846 Efficiency. 6.5 seconds casting time + 2.5 recovery + 7.0 recast.

3.593 Efficiency. 6.2 seconds casting time + 2.5 recovery + 2.5 recast.

Uh-huh, more mana (albeit only 5 more mana), 225 less damage, and
magic based. And look at the short time needed! Whoo-hoo, call me
a wizard!

And all cleric nukes are mana based, and clerics have no way of
lowering *any* resists. Yay.

Interestingly enough, Moonfire does more damage *and* costs less
mana than Magicians' Ancient: Shock of Sun. Gee, wonder if mages
are happy about that? I mean, it's an Ancient spell, ferchrissakes.

>5) they have a mem blur spell.

Which works oh so well on high level mobs...

>6) they are and always will be the best ressers in the game a critical

That's true, clerics do have something other than Complete Heal: They
have Reviviscence too! Wow, what a versatile class!

>7) they have all the fear and all the root spells.

And no snare, so what good is their fear?

>8) while they dont have invis they have invis undead and only wizards
>overlap both.

Uh-huh. Necros. Enchanters. *Shadow knights*. Add to that the fact
that clerics are the *only* caster class that *doesn't* get Invis,
gee, maybe they *need* to be a plate class when they're beaten to a
pulp by the 90% of the non-undead mobs in the game while they're
*walking*, not porting, to their hunting grounds.

You have very little in the way of facts, and a lot of misinformation
and pure falsehoods up there, bubba.

Are you seriously arguing that clerics are as efficient at soloing as
druids are? I mean, really? Cause if you are, I want some of what
you're smoking...

All that said, I would *love* to see Complete Heal being removed and
the raid-level encounters toned down. CH is totally broken, and as a
result, all raid encounters are equally broken. If CH went the way of
the dodo, I might even take my cleric out of retirement... And I sure
wouldn't mind if druids got *some* improvement in healing, either.
