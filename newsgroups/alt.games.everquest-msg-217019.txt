That monk pulled better than the two rangers who took over pulling
when they arrived.

Well, I'd say she proved her inability to tank BoT upon her last
death.

When I checked my logs to verify how little time passed, I saw she
hadn't cast a thing. Funny; stepping away from that giant (which
spawned in the corner we were medding up in) worked for me, and I have
less ac/hps than any 65 shaman. Once she got hit by the sandstorm, her
hps went low enough that the SK couldn't get it off her, and she died
and blamed me.
