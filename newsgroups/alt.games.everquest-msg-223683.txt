I used to think I had rotten luck - but the primary and shoulders on
my mage were rolled in PU raids (IE not our guild's scheduled raids
which earn RPP and require RPP to get items).  The secondary and neck
are RPP buys (and I lucked out on the neck - the one person who could
beat me didn't bid because he didn't realize it wasn't cleric useable
and that the cleric with more points than either of us wasn't going to
bid :)
