Ya, generally speaking.

I mean it does happen sometimes that a guild is going for a mob, and another
guild follows them all the way down (generally because they believe the
first guild will fail, not so they can leap over them)

If both guilds are ready at the same time then some kind of deal is generaly
worked out.. be it a random between raid leaders, a deal made on other mobs
in the zone, training the fuck out of em, or whoever pulls a_certain_mob
first...  e.g if you want to fight Statue, you need to kill Vindi first.
Whilst vindi isn't an "uber mob", he does require a certain force that shows
the guild/raid isnt dragging their feet, and actually ready to fight
