I was really too young and living in the wrong part of the country
when all that started up to be playing. But I remember it somewhat. I
remember that old Tom Hanks movie about it, too. >< I wonder what ol'
Tom has to say about that movie now days?

I saw the Jack Chick tract "Dark Dungeons" for the first time a couple
years ago when Scott Kurtz did his PvP parody of it. Reading through
that thing, I swear I felt my brain trying to escape out my ear. I'm
just baffled that some people actually believe such drivel...

Anyway, hopefully AOL lets parents edit the red flag list on their
filter rather than forcing them to throw the baby out with the bath
water, so to speak.
