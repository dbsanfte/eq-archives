It's a good bet that the Ashen Order works the same way as Silent Fist.
Trust me when I tell you that you need to be Kindly to do either the
headband or sash quests. (No idea about shakles for the Ikkies.)  I
started out my illustrious monk's career by accidentally killing the
"lost quest monk" out in the newbie area of Qeynos. It took me FOREVER
to get back even to amiable killing BB gnolls. Even then, I still
couldn't do the fucking quest, and had to gank a few hundred more to get
to Kindly, and then I could do them. Hang in there and keep bashing dem
orcs.
