I played EQ1 for almost 4 years and really enjoyed it for most of that time, 
but in the end it started to feel more like work than a game.  That will 
give you an idea of where I'm coming from when I reply here.

They did a fantastic job with EQ2.  Graphics are beautiful, the 
interface/engine is fantastic (passive targetting is just the most wonderful 
invention of all time, though it's not original to EQ2).  The voice-overs 
are nifty, though tedious after awhile (there are options to change that 
though).  The tactics and strategy of EQ1 carry over (not the same type, but 
the presence of them) so it's a game for more serious players which is a 
good thing since it reduces the number of idiots by a good amount. 
Basically what I'm saying is that EQ2 is the game that I wish I had played 
for the almost 4 years that I played EQ1.  In the end though, after 3 weeks 
or so of playing, I grew bored of it for the same reason I eventually grew 
bored of EQ1.  The fun factor wasn't there for me, and the work factor was. 
Had I never played EQ1, or only played it for a short time though, I 
probably would have loved EQ2 and been playing it for years before the 
boredom factor started hitting.

World of Warcraft on the other hand is an immensly fun game.  Highly 
addicting and engaging.  Some criticize the graphics for being "cartoony" 
but in not trying to have a world that looks "real" as EQ2 does, it has a 
great deal of style.  And (this is ONLY a personal preference, not a 
judgement) when I play a game I don't want to look into a window that shows 
me a world I see day to day, I want to see a game, an unreal world that is 
interesting looking to me.  Each of the classes are like nine separate 
games, they each play in different styles so much.

The quests pull you into the world and storyline quite nicely.  Some will 
say the quests hand you too much on a silver platter, but it's not all 
mindless drivel, you do actually have to think and figure things out (or go 
the typical MMO route and ask other people).  As a comparison, in EQ2 you 
may be given a quest to find a certain location or NPC in Antonica.  This is 
an absolutely ENORMOUS area (one you'd spend 10-20 or so in most likely if 
that gives you any idea) and aside from the quest telling you that person or 
place is in that zone, you don't get any more information.  Now, you could 
look up a map online, or read forums or ask players, but all of those 
resources fall outside of the game itself.  In WoW you'll be told to find 
someone in a smaller area or perhaps be told that they are near a cave.  Or 
you'll be told to head to a certain town and given basic road directions. 
The basic outline is given to you, but actually finding the place/person 
still requires some thought.  And there are also rewards for exploration 
outside of what is given to you directly.

Anyway, all of that to say, your past experience sounds similar to mine, and 
if so, I would suggest giving WoW a try.  To me it's the perfect mix of 
fast, fun gameplay and tactics and strategy and decent end game content.  My 
own opinion is that it falls somewhere nicely between City of Heroes and 
Everquest.

Good gaming and good hunting, whichever game you eventually choose.


All statements in this post are purely opinion and are not meant to be taken 
as judgements or meant to degrade those that feel otherwise.  Other opinions 
are welcome and encouraged, but flames and posts of the "you're a moron if 
you think WoW is cool" flavor will be ignored.  :)

Game on.
