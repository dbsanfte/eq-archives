I've heard that a ton of people are switching over. I would rather not
because of my time invested in EQ and I've really never had any problems
with Verant.  How many of you have tried DAOC?  Would you recommend the
switch?  I love EQ it's just that almost all the friends I've made are
leaving for DAOC, can I save myself time and money and expect that they will
come back? Just curious..
Thanks
