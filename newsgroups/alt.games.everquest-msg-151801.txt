Actually, it does scale a little.  It starts out giving 170 mana.  By 60 is
gives 300.  In FT terms, if you use it every 10 minutes, it starts out
equivalent to FT 1.7 and reaches FT 3 at 60.  (Actually, it gives 171-301,
but costs 1 to cast).

I often don't use it every 10 minutes, though...prefering sometimes to save
it for when I need some extra mana.  E.g., when I was getting my OS key, the
Forager was near the limits of what I could kill.  I threw in a root, ran
ahead a bit, and Harvested to get the mana for one last big nuke to kill
him.

> Oh, and they get mana regen via familiar.

Yup.  Level 49 familiar adds 1/tick.  54 is 2/tick.  60 is 4/tick.  They
cost a lot of mana to cast, though, so they aren't quite equivalent of FT 1,
FT 2, or FT 4 (490, 560, and 650, I think).

There is also Manaskin at level 52, which adds 1/tick (330 to cast, and
takes a Peridot).  It also adds a damage absorber of 521-591.
