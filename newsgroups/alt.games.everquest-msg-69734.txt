I find that what method you use depends deeply on what you're fighting.

Lvl 31-34
For instance, I find that for killing the cougars in Iceclad, one needs to
snare them and get them to come toward you near the docks.  Hit them with
fear right above the docks.  They will head, slowly, off the dock.  (If they
are not snared and you hit them with fear at this point they will run, off
the dock, and begin swimming toward Atonica.  I find this very good for
adds.  They usually do not return.)  I hit them with a DOT, then DD/nuke
them until dead or fear wears off.  When fear wears off, I hit them with it
again and continue to nuke.  Got me up 3 lvls this way.  God I hate them
cougars now.

Lvl 34-36
After that, I'm in GD but i'm fighting Coldains, not the giants.  I imagine
though they're much the same.  There are two kinds of critters here, either
faction, a wolf and a humanoid.  Fear won't work on the humanoid so the
above method is out the window.

Since I'm killing coldains i'm pulling from the obelisk (near Thurgadain on
the way to EW) back to EW.  First I snare them, then assuming that took I
back up until I'm out of their range.  Then I root 'em and DD. (Sometimes I
sneak in a DOT but I find they resist them far too often.)  This is all
assuming they don't resist.  Nasty buggers resist often.  In case of too
many resists, I recommend heading for the zone, either EW or Thurgadin
depending on which side you're on.  I have also rooted a creature and med'ed
but I would recommend doing so only after lvl 35 when you don't have that
book in your face and can watch them.

Oh, and always, always, always have SOW on in case snare doesn't take.  You
can get ahead of 'em and root 'em and try to snare again.

Good luck,

Cousin Raven
