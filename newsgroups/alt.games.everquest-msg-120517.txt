FV, on the zonewall opposite the city. Kite Drolvarg on the zonewall,
be bound at the FV bridge; whenever somebody is will to pay for a
port, you gate to city port them, gate back and continue hunting, very
profitable and the Drovarg are great exp and drop gold and 1-4pp. Turn
in four of their teeth to the warrior guild master, captain something,
for faction and a very little exp.
