No... I'm -advocating- them sending us a program.  Just not an ActiveX 
one, that forces us to open ourselves up to other problems.

*Shrug*  I had my security lowered before.  I got jumped by someone 
waiting in the wings.  Other people have also gotten jumped by people 
waiting in the wings.  If it's a real threat, it's hardly theoretical, 
much less paranoid.  And I am here, in this exact paragraph you're 
quoting, admitting it's on the order of a pet peeve.

But I'll wear my tinfoil hat, and you can wear a toonfoil one, and we'll 
both look ridiculous, ok?  I feel my views in this matter have been 
adequately explained.  But if you still need clarification, feel free to 
ask.
