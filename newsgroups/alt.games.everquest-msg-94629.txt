I bet you get far more "how much will you pay" from the times that you
send random tells to druids than if a druid offers a port.

I don't have annon on. So I often show up as the only druid about. I
frequently get tells saying "Port me to XX" or "Can you please port me
to XX" or "Paying yyy for port to XX" If I am hunting I am likely to
reply either "Sorry I'm hunting" or "What is it worth to you". If they
offer me something that is worth more of my time than hunting I will
port them. Simple.

Others who join the port go free (or donate as they see fit)

I hope that that clears that up.

Jim
