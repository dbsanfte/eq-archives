I seem to remember a long time ago seeing a Gate potion available for
sale off a merchant in Rivervale.

Can you still buy these and, if so, what are they called & how much do
they cost?

My enchanter can obviously gate but my Wife's Beastlord can't so we'd
really like to stock up on them - if they exist and aren't too
expensive.

Thanks,
