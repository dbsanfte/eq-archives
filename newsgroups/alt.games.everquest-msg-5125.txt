I wouldn't worry.  Sometimes skills just seem to stall for a while.  I was
almost all the way through 33 when suddenly I got 2 quick skill increases in
dual wield last night.  It happens.

If you've got any, I'd try putting on your dex/agi gear for a few fights and
getting some shaman buffs.  See if that can "KICK"start it <cracks up>
