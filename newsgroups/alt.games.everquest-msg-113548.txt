I've got to admit I don't understand "will donate".  Um, 
the word is PAY.  On the rare occasions I look for a tp
I auction "Paying xx plat for a port to somewhere".
You're paying someone for their time and mana, it's no
different than buying an object (can you imagine what responses
"Looking for mage spell : Call of the Hero - WILL DONATE"
would bring?)
