Its ok, Dark Tyger just likes being a pedantic little prick whenever he
posts to me.

All my dealings with people in EQ are done using "handles" (slight exception
being some people in this NG.. but in terms of my EQ life overall, this NG
plays a very small part)

A persons real life name would be quite meaningless in regards to EQ.. other
people seemed to grasp quite clearly what I meant DT, well with the
exception of you.
