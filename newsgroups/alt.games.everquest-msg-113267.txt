Did it ever occur to you that MAYBE you're wrong, or at least others
believe you to be wrong, and don't deserve any sympathy or
understanding?

No offense, but you shouldn't just assuming that people are going to
fall over themselves for you just because you think this is important.

Personally, I don't like being inspected without people asking, but
its so far down on my list of peeves that it only really rates as a
psuedo-peeve.
