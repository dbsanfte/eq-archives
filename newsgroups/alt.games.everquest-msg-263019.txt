Query if you need a new guild?   Heh.  So on your server it's considered ok
to try and recruit people who are already in other guilds?  Weird.

Well, either way I think telling them to fuck off is still the way to go.
I'm not looking for a new guild, and I wouldn't join one that invited via
random tell anyways.

If I wanted to go that route, there are more than enough guilds where I have
enough friends to make me comfortable.   But I think I'd prefer to just stay
in my current six member guild, and raid with the public at my convenience.

The weapons I'm carrying have no bearing on this.  I'm recieving tells from
people who are 5 zones away and may have never seen me in person.

Nope.   This is the first stretch where I have gotten any significant
amount.    Not having gone LFG much before the rush to get from 65 to 70 is
probably part of the reason, but even considering that, I have never
recieved random "hp / ac?" tells when not LFG before a few months ago.
