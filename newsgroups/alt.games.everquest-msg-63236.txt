Speaking of which, question...

"Chyna", or whatever her name is,was featured in Playboy sometime in
the last year. Intrigued by what struck me as an uncharacteristically
ugly cover girl, I took a look in the issue, and my original take was
confirmed. I had the distinct impression that this was a woman with as
much testosterone as silicone in her body.

In my opinion, at least, Chyna was *not* attractive or sexy as I
understand either term. Am I wrong in that, or are there guys who
actually are attracted to her?
