It wasn't really a quest, but it was pretty amusing, so I'll share. On
Rallos Zek, back when it was the only PvP server, I got involved with
a raid being planned on Freeport. A bunch of ogre's and trolls
intended to march up there from the swamps and squish some hummie
heads.

Well, this was a great idea, except none of the ogres or trolls
actually knew how to get to Freeport from the swamps of their home.
Eventually, one helpful troll offered to guide the warparty through
the treacherous lands surrounding the oasis of mar, and so the band
set out.

The warparty arrives in oasis from south ro, all 30-40 of them with no
difficulty, then the disaster came. Our guide tells us, "ok, after
south ro, just follow the left zone wall, all the way to no ro". So we
did. A mass troop of lowbie trolls and ogre's starts marching
essentially up the orc highway in oasis. It didn't take long for the
very red conning orcs to notice this band of Noobs, and the slaughter
soon commenced.

As I went back to recover my corpse, I remember stopping and looking
at the piles of corpses littering the sand. Thinking to myself, "It's
almost like the humans knew we were coming and paid these orcs to
ambush us! Oh the horror!"

Needless to say, the humans slept safe in Freeport that night.
