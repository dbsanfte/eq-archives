Hi there,
             I bought EverQuest about 2 years ago, pretty much when it was
released (here in the UK anyway).  I signed up and played a little but at
some point I removed it from my HD.  I have just re-installed it and now I
cant get my old account details and it will not let me create a new one.  I
obviously cannot remember my old station name and password after 2 years nor
can I remember the email address I used at the time, I bought the software
fair and square (I even have the till reciept!!) and I want to start playing
EverQuest, I have emailed the Sony help people but so far no response, wtf
am I supposed to do?  If its a case of having to buy EverQuest again I'm
gonna be rather annoyed and will prolly just bin the thing :(, hope someone
can help, thanks,

Paul.
