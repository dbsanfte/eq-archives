Making items no drop would not stop multiquesting.  Several players would
still be able to hand in nodrop items.  Happens all the time now.  If they
wanted to make a quest not be multiquestable, then they would make the items
nodrop, and have the quest giver hand over a container in which to combine
the nodrop items.  That way, you would have to at least be there to loot the
items, if not actually kill the mob(s) that drop them.
