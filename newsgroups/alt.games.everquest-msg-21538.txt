In that case, my advice would be to explain that fact
to your raid leader, and ask that you be allowed to launch
into Hate on the tail end of the break-in attack, instead
of the first or second wave.

That way you'll have less chance of the sort of multi-death
disaster that could roll you back to 45 and make you
unable to return to loot your corpse.

Similarly, if you die several times and start getting near
the point where another death or two would toss you back
to 45, BAIL OUT OF THE RAID before you risk getting locked
out from your equipment.  Have a Wizard translocate you
back out of Hate and come back another day.
