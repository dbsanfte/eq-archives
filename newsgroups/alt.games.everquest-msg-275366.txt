Look at it this way.  They don't want you using that word.  They have 
filters to prevent the obvious uses, but that doesn't mean bypassing the 
filter is okay.

If you park in a metered space that's posted "1 hour parking", but the 
meter is broken, you can still get a ticket for parking longer than 1 
hour.  All day long, people will get away with parking for longer than 
an hour, and will get no ticket.  That doesn't mean you didn't break the 
law.

In short: There's a rule.  You broke it.  You got busted.  It doesn't 
matter if the rule is stupid.  It doesn't matter if other people break 
the rule and don't get caught.  You broke the rule.  You paid the price.

The thing to do now is man up, get over it.  "Quit or quit not.  There 
is no whine."
