Some of us are just obstinate.  The very first rez I ever received was
a gift out of the blue from a 56 Cleric waiting on a Kedge raid.  I was
32 or 33 at the time (I think) and soloing Unrest... while bound in
Arena.  I got the tell from the Cleric about halfway thru my CR (was
nearing Freeport, heh, this was pre-Velious).  Here's the obstinate
part... that was my second death in Unrest that day, I'd already done
the Arena to Unrest run/boatride twice that day (once to get there,
once for the first CR).  After that I finally acknowledged that beating
my head on that particular brick wall produced some discomfort, so I
went and got bound in GFay.
