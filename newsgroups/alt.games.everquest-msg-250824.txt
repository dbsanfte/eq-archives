   I'm glad that all your friends have come back.  I don't know how you
felt about it of course, but I always felt a bit sad when someone I knew
ingame moved on to something else.  Maybe if EQ really does fix the
mechanics that have caused so much grief, they really will get most of the
lost ones back.

   The game is alot more flashy than EQ, and a very great deal more
shallow, no doubt about it.  I don't know about the "no staying power"
part, though.  CoH seems very good for us casual gamer types.  If you can't
log on for hours and hours, and still want to see some progression in you
character, CoH is not an unreasonable option.

    It will be interesting to me to see if they add deeper content as the
game ages, or if they are going to depend on a high turnover rate to keep
the numbers up.


> There's more serious threats on the horizon, of course.

    I never know how seriously to take those "next great game" threats.  I
seem to remember that there were alot of people who just knew that SWG
would be an EQ killer.  The buzz about WoW and EQII might be deserved, and
might actually do what some people seem to think that it will do to the EQ
numbers.  Or not.  I don't really think that there is a way for me to judge
that now.
