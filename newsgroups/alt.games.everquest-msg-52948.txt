If you are in a situation with only one tank (I'd say melee but if they are
the sole melee then they are the tank, whatever class they are) then I'd say
Alacrity increased haste making for better dam output and aggro but if you
have a few Melee classes (as is normal in a full group) then use Aug. For
the reasons you stated, costs less and lasts longer, with increased AC and
stamina regen makes it far more efficient as a spell.
