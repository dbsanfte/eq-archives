Yer all christians as far as this imaginary wiccan is concerned; don't 
care if you are Seventh Day Adventists, Miracle on Elm Streetists, or 
Church on the Rockers... just as some christians apparantly blame jews 
for killing Jesus (which makes little sense as Jesus was apparantly 
jewish himself)

Belief systems are funny things, see, if you actually believe them, then 
you are bound in to what they say.  Doesn't matter if every other person 
you meet things you are looney to buy into that crap, its part of the 
package.

SO if you believe that walking into a christian church is a crime 
against the real god, then having a bunch of people tell you to get over 
it strikes me as infringing on your beliefs.

Do I make you attend chicken sacrifices just because -I- practice 
Santaria?  Its just a chicken, after all, you eat them 3 days a week, 
get over it!  If you want to vote, you have to walk across the chicken 
blood and thats all there is to it, get over it.

Religious tolerance should mean respecting other people's beliefs no 
matter how wacky -you- think they are, as you casually sip on the blood 
and feast on the flesh of your own lord (in effigy of course)
