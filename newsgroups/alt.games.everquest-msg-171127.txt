You know, I've played with that exact group... me being the BL of course...
you'd be surprised.  Red cons went down like babies, fast-fast-fast, with
very little downtime.  Went something like this:  I buff everybody at the
start, then med for five minutes to get my mana back up... then we fight,
rogues melees and backstabs, warrior melees (of course), and me and my pet
melee :)  Anyone gets below 50% HP, they back off a ways and sit down for a
bit and when I have a free moment I throw a few heals their way.  I get low
on mana, I go sit down for a bit and leave my pet to melee while I regen.  I
know, I know, three melee classes sucks.  But it worked pretty damn well.
Of course, we were all around lvl 30 so maybe it's different higher up...

The trick is to take turns holding aggro... especially since both I and my
pet hold aggro amazingly well, so all I have to do is keep out of it (or
keep my pet out of it, whichever works better) until someone gets low, then
jump in so they can med.

Also you have to be sure you go far enough away when you med that you won't
get sitting aggro.
