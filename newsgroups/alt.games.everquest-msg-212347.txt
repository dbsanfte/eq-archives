Making it with consenting adults, (or pies for that matter) doesn't 
involve pressuring/coercing young children into situations that, by all 
accounts, is emotionally damaging.

Emotionally damaging someone makes it 'not ok'.

 > If people are

I'm not saying one way or the other. Nor do I think its relevant. Even 
if God deliberately creates pedophiles, I'm still not going to let them 
near my kids. I don't let cougars near my kids either, and nobody 
bothers questioning whether they are 'evil'; we just agree they 
shouldn't be loose around kids.

> the age of consent?

In my opinion no, Not everything. I don't believe shooting yourself full 
of heroine is ok, for example. I don't think there is a moral 
justification that would permit one to perform permanent irreparable 
damage to ones otherwise healthy brain.

But a harmless, even if not 'productive', activity between two 
consenting adults? Hard to see what an unaffected outside party like me 
would have to get agitated about.

Statistical abnormality really isn't useful either for determining 
morality. I'm sure someone out there likes making it with pumpkin 
pie... but you can probably count them on your fingers and toes. And at 
any rate... nobody really cares, regardless of how abnormal it is.

possibly there are even fewer homosexuals than pedophiles.
> Homsexuality is not "natural." 

Its not 'unnatural' either. Natural simply means it occurs in nature. It 
  does. But again whether something is natural or not is irrelevant to 
determining whether or not it is moral.

So is preferring a game of tennis to hetero-sex. But nobody chases 
couples out of the courts for immorality.
