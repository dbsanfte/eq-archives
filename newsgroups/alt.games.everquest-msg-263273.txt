I have a geforce 4 ti 4200.

I think my video card is blown but am not yet sure. When I'm in safe mode, i
seem ok but there's weird problems (like characters in text not showing up,
or the minimise maximise close button set showing scrambled) when i use the
driver from either microsoft or nvidia. A few weeks ago, everything was fine
but everquest and i haven't been able to predict if i'll reboot now and that
pc will show windows normally or not. I've checked everything i can and
pushed boards in etc, even got a new powersupply which changed some reboot
problems. I have a surge protector built in to the power board but maybe
it's not reliable, can't really tell. I'm going to swap this card into the
other pc and see if the problem vanishes, and if so, it's the video card, if
not, i'm stumped.

I've swapped a linux hard drive in and that didn't have any problems and
formatted the drive with w2k pro to see if it made any difference. There';s
little consistency here which makes things worse.

Assuming the video card is the source of my woes, can anyone recommend a
good video card? Something grunty enough to support omens features?
