I wouldn't call it great. I wouldn't even call it good.  For a rogue,
straight melee way overshadows thier throwing damage, even without backstab.

Typical throwing attack session.

You land a critcial hit! 23!
You land a deadly strike! 36!
You land a deadly strike! 36!
You land a deadly strike! 36!
You land a critcial hit! 23!
You land a deadly strike! 36!

... during the same time, had the rogue meleed....

You pierce for 87.
You pierce for 75.
You slash for 112
You slash for 85
You backstab for 450
You score a critical hit! 986!
You backstab for 986.
You pierce for 99
You pierce for 87
You slash for 60.
etc...

The only way throwing would ever even be considered "good" for a rogue would
be in comparison to non ranger melee classes throwing attacks.  Rogue is the
best of the bunch, but none of them are worth using.
