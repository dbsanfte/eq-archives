Sneaking lowers the aggro range, but MOBS will still attack if you get
within that smaller range.  It is handy if you need to get into a dangerous
place for corpse retrieval. I used it once as a very young rogue before I
had Hide and Sneak to sneak up behind the bandits in West Karana to get my
corpse.  I was quite pleased with myself at the time.
