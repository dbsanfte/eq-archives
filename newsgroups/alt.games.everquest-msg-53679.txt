 John, it sounds to me like you don't have much of a clue how to play
your class. Do you know about making a hotkey to /assist your puller?
If not I suggest you learn. I would also pay more attention to your
spell messages, it only takes me one nuke to know I've nuked a charmed
MOB and I USUALLY can tell it's charmed even before I nuke it (because
it's smacking on another MOB).
