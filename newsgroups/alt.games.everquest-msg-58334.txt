Eu�clid1 (ykld), Third century B.C. 

Greek mathematician who applied the deductive principles of logic to
geometry, thereby deriving statements from clearly defined axioms

I'm pretty sure the (kl) is "hard."

That was only one I could think of which is similar to "Luclin." I
have no idea why I knew that name. 

oh wait, 

include

Oh, here is another:

ec�cle�si�as�tic (-klz-stk)
adj. 
Ecclesiastical.

If you notice in all of these the cl is "kl" which is hard so Luclin
should be "Luck" lin.

So it would be LUCK then LIN sounding like the "Li" in LID, or Limp
since its a consonant after the "i" with no vowel after it I'd
imagine.
