What version of DirectX are you using? If you get the hourglass at all
when you are playing, that indicates that Windows has probably re-taken
control of your video. Make sure you are using DX 7.0a (although 8
works, even though it's not supported) and update your video and sound
drivers. Make sure that you re-install DX after installing the sound and
video drivers, though. Also, if you are having a problem going into one
zone in particular, try deleting the zone files and re-patching. If THAT
still doesn't work, check any firewall settings that you have, and make
sure that you are not blocking anything that you don't know needs to be
blocked.
