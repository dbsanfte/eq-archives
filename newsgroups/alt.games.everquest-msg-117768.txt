Yeah many of the quests are like that, and a bit dull. But you can do them
the other way round (get a rare drop and ask what it is FOR, and then
do the quest, instead of deciding what you want and going for it)

Some quests like the necro harvester quest which I just did, are much
better. At the level you are likely to do it they require a group of two
or more people so it's a bit less boring. It takes maybe five or six
hours to do, but there are several different parts to it so no one
part gets too boring. And it takes you to places you might never
have been to otherwise, like the island in the ocean of tears and
deep into unrest.

I think that they are getting better at quests though. I have a troll
beastlord alt, and the newbie armor quest is good. Kill stuff you
could have killed anyway, so there is no camping involved as
such, but it's an ongoing quest where you get a new piece of
equipment at each stage so you feel like you are making progress
and are encouraged to just try the next stage.
