I like how he references me to someone who slaughtered millions of
innocent people based upon race and religion. My great grandparents
DIED that way. So take BIG FUCKING offense to that you piece of shit
kiddie.

I regard you short bus morons in that way because of the mentality
you brought in this room.

So just shut the fuck up. And get on the bus.

You are not "Chairman" or "Leader" of any newsgroup. You are a pathetic
perseon trying to gain repect in a NG which you know NOTHING about
and going about it all the wrong way.

Everytime you morons post something its just fuel for us to slander you.

Go away.
