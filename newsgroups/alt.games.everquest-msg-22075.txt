Dont qoute me but ive read that Verant take the stance "If you knowingly
exploit a mobs behaviour/pathing to gain an unfair advantage your breaking the
rules".
Considering youre fully aware the Orc cant jump before you hit it and use this
to your advantage i would think youre definately bending the rule. The fact
that it cant jump is definatley a path issue as it obviously hasnt been
programmed to negotiate the river any other way than using the bridge.
