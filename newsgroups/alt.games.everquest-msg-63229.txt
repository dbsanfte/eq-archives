I apologize.  I am certain that there was either a file to download or a
page that listed many (not all) of the trivials.  I remember that all of the
spells had trivials that were higher than the level that they could be first
used.  The trivial level is generally in the last or second from last level
that they are first available.

The chart may have been elsewhere.  I'll look through my files and links
closely.
