However, duck does *not* cancel the spell casting effects.  This allows you
to get some really nice looking particle effects around yourself.  When
arriving for a social event with my Wizard, such as a wedding, I use this to
make a good looking entrance.  I levitate, and come running in.  While
running, I have myself targetted, and do something like the following:

1. Hit Harvest, and briefly duck.  Starts the nice blue Harvest particles,
which last 10 seconds.

2. Hit my self-shielding, and briefly duck.  Starts the glowing hands and
some more nice particles, which last a long time (that spell takes forever
to cast).

3. Hit Ice Comet, and briefly duck.

4. Hit a fire-based nuke, and briefly duck.

5. Hit a magic-based nuke, and briefly duck.

6. Hit a port, and briefly duck.

7. Go back to step 1.

As I run, all these things particles are trailing behind me.  It looks
really great.
