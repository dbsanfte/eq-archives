Hehe, i can only again point out that in my experience, the best place 
for spider silk are Guk, not EK.

Good things about EK:
Spiders drop 0-8 silk
Usually a fair number of spiders around.

Bad things about EK:
Not uncommon to see 5 high level people shout KS at each other while 
they blast away to get silk, leaving you close to no chance of getting any.
Spiders are spread out in a big area, you need to do a lot of running, 
and if your a soloing caster, you also have to sit and med and cant 
search for them while you do.
Risk of being aggroed, especially while medding.


Good things about Guk:

Spiders drop 0-4 silk

11 spiders in a close area.
Can camp the area (once i had a guy try to steal the back room, but 
after he started shouting to the zone about it, they all booed at him. 
After 2 deaths he left. He could have been saved, but i didnt exactly 
feel like saving that guy).
Guaranteed repop every 16 min.
You know where the spiders are, so no hunting around, and then you have 
time to med.
At level 30+ spiders dont gang up on you.
No risk of adds/aggro.
Less damaging poison than on EK ones.
Less than 30 sec run from zone.

Bad things about Guk

Less silk drop than NK. 

Usually have to wait a few min from FOM to pop start again.
Spiders run when damaged enough (solved if you can snare).
Sometimes camped.



 From these good and bad points on hunting, i can only reccomend Guk if 
you want silk fast. If its camped, ask the guy if he can tell you when 
he leave, and head to EK in the meantime.
