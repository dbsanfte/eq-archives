Not a dumb question.  It's an exclamation of happiness. :-)

Different folks think it originated in different ways.  I remember hearing
it in my MUD days ... rumor then was that it came from hacker-types.  When
they would break a Unix box and get access to the root, they would yell
"Root!".  Since a lot of those same types were MUDders, so the story goes,
they modified it to "Woot!" for use when gaming.

Any other versions of the origination of Woot out there?  I personally enjoy
stuff like that ... finding out where a particular turn of a phrase
originated. :-)
