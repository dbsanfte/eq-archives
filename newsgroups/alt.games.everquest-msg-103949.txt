 Depends on when they killed him. IV used to be pullable to the zone.
After numerous upgrades to him they finally rooted him. Even then he was
pretty gimpy since you could bump him out of the room with knockback
items. Now, however, it's not quite so trivial since he is permarooted
in his room and can't be pushed out. The main problem with him is
controlling adds. Once you get that worked out you shouldn't have a
problem.

 Invis, take a right. Most times you'll make it with no problems.
Easiest thing to do is just set up CoH.
