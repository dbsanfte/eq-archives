While I have heard that it can still be done with mages, we have found that
using two melee with enough healers on each to keep them standing, and lots
of FR gear on the melees is the way to go.  The fight has gone flawlessly
each time we have done it that way, unlike the mage pet route.  First time,
we put 3 healers (cleric, 58+ druid/shaman) on each of the two melee, and
found it to be way overkill.  If the two melee you are using, are 60+ with
high FR, then, you should be fine with one cleric for each.  You can have
more melee present to hop in once he is low on HP, but it's not necessary.
Have the mages add their pets in too, but, don't count on them being the
only ones tanking him.
