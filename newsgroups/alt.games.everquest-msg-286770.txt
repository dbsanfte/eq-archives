As ridiculous and gimmicky this is, I'm actually looking forward to

This is hilarious considering the wailing and gnashing and foaming and
screaming that goes on in the "classic server" thread at the EQ

nearly the sustainability that people hope for, but a new and unique
special ruleset might be interesting.

Monster missions and shrouds?  That's actually the most interesting
way I've seen to mix levels, it's a shame they couldn't get it done
