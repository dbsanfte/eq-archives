In a group, particularly in a 4 man or 3 man group, I doubt very much 
you're going to have a MA thats a different person than the MT.

What you're discussing is alternative MT's; and a cleric is an 
interesting choice for the job, although if you're going that route, I 
think you might want to consider a shaman.  Beauty of the shaman MT is 
that his Slow is great aggro, in fact the bane of an ordinary MT's 
existance, and his DPS is pretty poor, so the fact that he's keeping 
himself in Torpor doesn't matter much.

My cleric used to solo quite often, using similar techniques to the one 
you're talking about here; keep HOT on self, use stuns and bash to 
"slow" the mob down, and the pet to do a good chunk of the DPS.  Adding 
practically anyone to that mix improved it dramatically; a real tank 
would absorb damage better, but any DPS class could take advantage of my 
aggro lock to deal damage; the groups you are talking about are built 
that way.

On "real" content, though, I found that the cleric's relatively poor 
damage mitigation meant a "real tank" was a better pick.  Despite 
clerics wearing plate armor, I always took much more damage than a real 
tank with the same AC; I'm told this is because clerics are on a 
different defensive table than melee classes.
