Froggy Crown 500 (usually 800 to 1k), Velium BD Bracelet 1100 (lowest
I've seen since the new smithing recipes), pair of Platinum Fire
Wedding Rings for 100 each (lower than vendor price!, resold via
bazaar at a nice little profit), Healing Wave of Prexus 100 (of
course, it's not worth a whole lot to me unless I actually go out
and gain the required levels).
