    If I'm not MT I'm behind the mob anyway.

    Most fights I get riposted maybe once with the WMBS [picked it up for
12k the other night]... that would be on average 0.5 times per fight with
the windblade. I can understand how ripostes might be an issue with mobs
that hit for 3k, but I don't think I'll *ever* be MTing them. If I ever tank
something that hits hard ill consider using a slower weap <g>

    Am very happy with WMBS's DPS! And it's only going to get better as the
ludicrous 2h bonus grows towards level 65 :>

    It was also half the price of the nearest windy, and gives about the
same +hp.

    Well after gaining the last 3 levels duoing and grouping with my shammy
friend, faster than any 3 levels I could name since the 40's... I take him
seriously :)

    But I think that's more to do with the sk/shammy thing than his race...

    That's actually the only time it's been a problem for me since I got my
first eye-buff spell. I've got the choice of infra or ultravision now, and
my best bit of fire/cold resist gear is also a lightsource (crown of froglok
kings :), so I think deaths due to human-ness are going to be very rare even
in the future.

    On the other hand, I benefit from the lack of exp penalty every single
kill.

    And almost as important... I don't look like any other SK I've ever met.
I can't recall grouping with another human SK, not once, ever. Dark elves
seem common, aside from that it's ogres (usually ogres are twinks, dunno why
that is) next popular I think then maybe iksar.

    I only recall one troll SK too... but being an SK I rarely group with
them - not the best stacking class.

    Well with deaths being so [relatively] meaningless these days, I dont
get annoyed usually. Kremitt (shammy friend) has a 62 pally main so a nice
rez is never far off. It's worse when he dies cos you can't rez your own
alt. Which is stupid AS.

    The only death that really annoyed me lately was getting delberately
trained by a dickhead in velks because we refused to group with him (because
he had a bad rep for deliberately training people). I've since seen him and
his alts booted from three consecutive guilds so I'm over that one.

    Wont stop me talking to every single guild leader of every single guild
that he joins with any of his dickhead characters for the rest of his life
though, and encouraging the dozen or so other people I found in the "victims
of %X" club to do the same.

    I don't get how people can do it either. I mean in seb I can kind of
understand it, its a bit of a race when guard isn't camped to see who can
get there first. But other situations... I just don't see it. The only time
I've unintentionally pulled a mob from someone else's camp lately I gave
them 10pp compensation. And considering they were a level 8ish main, that's
a lot of dosh! :)

    Coming from you that's a compliment Richard :>

    That story was at least partly monual fan fiction <g>
