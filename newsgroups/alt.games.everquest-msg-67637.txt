  Sure, if you "upgrade" to a system configuration which is known to
be function properly in EverQuest.  For many of us altering our system
configuration just to play a single game is not a very appealing
option, especially considering the fact that for most of us, the game
functioned just fine prior to the engine "upgrade".  Heck, I was even
able to play on the Test server using the beta engine up until patch
day.

  Plus, there are people out there who have computers which meet and
exceed the system requirements posted on the EverQuest web site who
STILL can not play, or can't play without serious issues.  You only
need to read the official EverQuest web site to see that even Verant
recognizes there are some problems with the engine.  That's why there
have been so many patches recently, if you hadn't noticed.  Hopefully
the most recent one will have taken care of most of the lingering
problems, however.

  In any case, just because EQ happens to work fine for you isn't a
reason to deride people for complaining that it doesn't work on their
systems.  I agree that petitioning and threatening lawsuits is a
fruitless activity to engage in, however.  A lawsuit isn't
economically feasible and petitioning does nothing but bring it to
Verant's attention that we're less than completely satisfied with
their customer service in this matter--duh, as if they don't know that
already.  A petition isn't going to make them care.  The only thing
that is going to make them care is if they lose customers from the
situation and see a significant impact on their bottom line.

  I really am, quite honestly, struggling to understand the behavior
of some of you on this newsgroup.  Verant quite obviously screwed up.
They did minimal testing of the game and the new engine before putting
it live, strongly evidenced by the fact that bard songs were almost
entirely non-functional post patch, in addition to the host of other
fairly severe problems.  How you overlook that sort of thing if you do
any semblance of testing is beyond me.  If you do come to the
conclusion that they did a poor job testing the engine due to the
rush, I think you have to also come to the conclusion that they did us
an injustice in not waiting until the engine was ready before making
mandatory for play.  Some people, unsurprisingly, complain about that
injustice.  Not all complaints are constructive in nature, but most
are fueled by some legitimate issue and are expressed in a relatively
mature fashion--a petition is a fairly harmless mechanism, even if you
happen not to agree with the principle behind it.  And yet some of you
see fit to deride, flame and ridicule others simply for expressing
frustration and displeasure over Verant's lacking customer service.

  Please tell me, what is "Waahhh... upgrade your computer" supposed
to contribute, besides perhaps make a person feel bad about their
situation?
