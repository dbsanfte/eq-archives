Ummm... an AC3 ring with 20 mana and no INT? I'll grant you the 30 HP is
nice for *some* caster classes if you are focusing on HP, but that ring
is nothing to write home about. I have two that give me more than 20
mana easily, and my gear is far from Ubah.  And the mana regen 2 is nice
up to what? Level 44?

For a lower level caster, sure, I guess. But you can already buy far
better in the bazaar quite cheaply.
