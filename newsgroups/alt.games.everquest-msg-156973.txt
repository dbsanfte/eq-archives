Not anymore.  Only the named mobs in Chardok will be blue.  The rest will be
green to a level 65.  Almost 100% of Charasis will be green at 65.
Everything but the named and their guardians will be green in the Deep at
65.

The dozens of exp zones to hunt in from Old World, Kunark, and Velious will
turn into 1 or 2 with level 65 (Temple of Veeshan, Veeshan's Peaks, and
Cazic Thule are about the only zones that will offer a "constant" supply of
blues).  In Luclin there are a few more zones, but not many (Umbral Plains,
Vex Thal, portions of other zones will offer "constant" and "consistant"
amounts of solid blues).

You level to 65, you pretty much tie yourself to raid exp and/or PoP exp
zones.
