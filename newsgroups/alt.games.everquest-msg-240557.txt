At what time of the day do you petition?  Are there GMs/Guides online
when you do?  When a Guide is online they're supposed to take off their
/anonymous tag for the world to see them.  They go invisible if they're
watching something happen in a zone or otherwise logging off.  When
they check your petition they check for you three times before deleting
your petition.  If you're not online on any character on the server on
your account they will ignore the petition and go onto the next.  Three
strikes and it's deleted.  Most likely what your problem has been. 
Just some info from a friend who used to be a Guide for a while long
ago that I ask every now and again.

As for me, I've had my share of petitions that were answered and not
answered.  I could have lived either way, except for this one time. 
Saw this guy with the surname "Spankiezemonkie", and petitioned for
improper name.  The next day I looked up while I was in the middle of a
Vex Thal raid and saw "Zelgadis Spankiezemonkie" on my character name
bar.  I petitioned right away and within 15-30 minutes I had a response
and a guide bolted into the zone and fixed my surname up with whatever
I wanted.  What a relief!  =)
