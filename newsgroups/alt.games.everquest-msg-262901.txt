Umm.... he might want to familiarize himself with the /lfg tool. I
WISH people knew about and used this more. I use it to assemble
groups, mostly LDONs all the time for my low/mid level cleric (haven't
found a guild yet). Anyways, not sure why he'd care, since he 5-boxes
anyway.

Also, I don't know about others here, but i get a bad feeling from the
cockyness this guy comes across with. Maybe he is that great and all,
but that attitude makes me instantly dislike him. /shrugs
