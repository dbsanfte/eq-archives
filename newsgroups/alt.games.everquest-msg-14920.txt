I don't care if someone inspects.  I have the message turned off, I don't
see it.  And I have my description set to "No, I do not have any extra money
or equipment for you".

Every once in awhile, I get a tell out of the blue asking for the stats on a
particular piece, but I have yet to have anyone ask me to give them
something I'm wearing.

And from time to time, I'll slip, and accidentally inspect someone.  I used
to apologize for it, but stopped.  I have yet to have anyone say anything
about that, either.
