The hearts are rare drop, 1/4 or so from the ghasts. The ghasts 
themselves only spawn at EQ night, so this quest WILL take some time to do.
The easiest way are to get a wolf form (to aviod brownies, instant death 
for low levels, and run around killing all the moving undeads during the 
night. All roaming undeads are PHs for the Ghasts, so the more you kill, 
the better chance for ghasts. I ONCE saw a ghast around 10 AM, but im 
99% sure its a leftover from nighttime that didnt come in tracking range 
before then.
Depending on your level, there are other things to do in Lfay while 
hunting Ghasts. I did the quest at level 35, and at that time, a named 
brownie called Thistle Underbrush were green (would be light blue now) 
to me. He drop brownie meat (for baking), some mistletoe powder that 
sell for a few pp each at vendors, and can drop the Ivy Etched 
Shoulders, a nice druid item, and it can sell for i guess 100-300pp, 
depending on server. Its NOT lore, i personally got 5 while hunting 
ghasts, and got 2 blue bubs of XP at level 35 (hell level then) on 
killing a green mob :).
