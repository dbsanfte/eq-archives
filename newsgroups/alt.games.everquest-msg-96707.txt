A lot of this stuff is in place on the Test Server already. 
Some old friends there reported the following changes:

* No more hell levels (45 is reportedly moving like a normal level)
* Level 10s and under respawning with gear
* A new chat channel for raids
* /rtarget command (targets player who last gave you a tell) 
* New race/class combos. Halfling Ranger, Gnome SK, Gnome Pally
  were mentioned.

Have not heard anything from Test about book-free pre-35 medding.
