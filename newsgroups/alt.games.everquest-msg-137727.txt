Bingo! Glad you finally see it. A character was scammed out of their 
property, therefore the GMs intervene. If there was no property, there 
would have been no violation.

Hm. Are you actually a bit fuzzy on the difference between "in the game" 
and "out of the game", or are you arguing the point because you love 
debate so much?

Let me explain: "out of the game", Verant owns everything, including 
your characters, and you aren't allowed to sell them for cash. "in the 
game", you own everything you have looted, purchased or been given, and 
you are permitted (and indeed encouraged) to buy and sell those items, 
because *in the game* they are your property.

If the concepts of "in real life" and "in the game" still remain elusive, 
I suggest you avoid watching The Matrix, it could be a bit too much.

Well, if there is no "ownership" then obviously there cannot be buying 
and selling, and if there cannot be buying and selling, then the Bazaar 
is one hell of a bug they have introduced in the system...
