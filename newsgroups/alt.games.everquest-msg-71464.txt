A lot of times, it was better than the book.  Yes, really.

After watching the film, pick up your old copy of LotR and 
reread the balrog confrontation, and Boromir's death.
Both are *really* thin in the books.

In the book, the balrog scene is really short, it
is just, "something big-and-scary's coming, <insert short vague
description of fire and shadow here>, it takes a swing
at Gandalf and he blocks it, then Gandalf bonks his wand
on the bridge and it caves in taking the balrog with it".
The passage is so short (about a single page) that it's pretty
much resolved before the reader can work up any real 
suspense over it.  Compare that to the film's drawn-out
treatment, which gives you time to work up read dread,
and to truly appreciate the power of the beast.

Likewise for Boromir's death.  In the book, they just
come running up and find Boromir already dead, riddled
with arrows.  Oh well, let's stuff him on a boat,
time's a wastin'.  The film gave him a much more
dramatic and in-character end.

And so on.

The book has much more "back story", but frankly
it's awfully rushed during a lot of the "front story",
as if Tolkien wanted to hurry up to the next 40-page
section on Elvish pottery.  Many times, the film
actually does a better job of covering the main
story arc than the book did.


>Yes, Legolas was WAY COOL, the way he unloaded arrow after arrow
>into the orcs and Uruk-Hai rocked!

Did you notice that at one point, he nocked and fired
*two* arrows simultaneously?  Way cool indeed.


>Gimli got too few lines, I think he spoke about four times or so...
>But the dwarves looked Just Right, at least.

Speaking as a dwarf meself (*cough*), I agree.


>Some parts were changed, for no apparent reason. For instance,

When condensing a big book for the screen, distilling
multiple characters into one is a time-honored technique.
Rather than give Arwen and Glorfindel each a single thing
to do in the film (turning them into "blink and you miss them"
characters), it's better to have a single "Arwenfindel" character.
