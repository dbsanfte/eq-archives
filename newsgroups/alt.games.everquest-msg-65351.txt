Specifically the Developer's Corner board, but the tech help has a hell of a
lot of help as well.

From the boards posted yesterday:

Tips and reminders

DirectX 8.1 is required to play EverQuest. I wanted to make that clear.
Problems like "No 3D devices found" and many others can be fixed by
upgrading to DX 8.1. Run DXDiag.exe and make sure the version says "DirectX
8.1 (4.08.01.0881)".

For those using NVIDIA cards, the 23.11 drivers have proven to give much
better performance in EverQuest. You can find a link to them here on our
driver support page.

Clipping Plane! Remember, you can pull in your clipping plane if you are
having problems with your framerate.

Choosing which models to load. Ester asked me to make sure that everyone
understood that when we talk about going to the "options" to choose which
models to display, we mean the options BEFORE you log in, not the options in
game. This is done before you log in because it has to know what models to
load before you log in.

Another tip for the more advanced computer user - It might be a good idea to
turn off your swap file, run a defrag and then turn your swap file back on.
It's nice to have an unfragmented swap file. If you don't know how to do
this, then don't worry about it.

Oh! And, yes, there is a typo in the printed manual that comes with the
game. I apologize to all of the budding young makeup artists out there for
calling you Rouges rather than Rogues.
