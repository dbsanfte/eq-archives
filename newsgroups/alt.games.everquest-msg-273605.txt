     It sounds to me that Bob provided a good life lesson, indeed.  But
some people are very lesson resistant.  The fact that the recruit in
question was giving away all his stuff saying it was because the game
was impossible due to it being so hard to find a guild makes me think
that he might be the type to always blame others, rather than himself. 
I doubt that he learned a thing.
