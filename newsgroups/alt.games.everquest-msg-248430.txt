/agree.  I've noticed this as well, and my playing time used to be a
combination of peak and off peak.  The population is definitely dwindling.

/agree there, too.  I think folks should take a good hard look at what's
happening to the Mac folks to see how it's going to end.  When the decision
is made that a certain aspect of the community is expendable, they're
removed without much fanfare.  Another example is the number of times over
the years that happy subscribers were forcibly removed enhancing system
requirements.  I'm not saying the game should still be played using it's
original UI, but I am saying that when the time came to upgrade th epowers
that be just decided that a certain percentage of their satisfied customers
were now acceptable collateral damage.

This is exactly the reason why I canceled my main account's subscription
this weekend.  I have a stable of characters that I enjoyed playing, and
have gotten them all (at least all of the ones I was really interested in
advancing past midgame) to the point where there was nothing to do but raid
... and I despise raiding.  Saturday night I came to the realization that I
hadn't logged for two weeks and hadn't really taken notice of the fact ...
so I patched, logged in, and clicked the 'Cancel' button.

The following is not gospel, it is hearsay.  Please take it as such.

I have a friend who is in the gaming business (not as programmer .. the
business end of the business), and statements he's made in passing have been
on the mark before (a few examples, he called the end of Earth & Beyond
almost a year before it was announced, and he called the raise in EQ level
from 60 to 65 about a year in advance as well).  He rather nonchalantly
stated one day that the plan as he understood it was that SOE was going to
stop patches and expansions 12 months after EQ2 launch whenever that may be.
At that point they were going to begin sunsetting servers starting with
those who had the lowest average populations, offering those who were
disenfranchised EQ2 accounts at discounted rates.  One year after that SOE
would turn the lights out on EQ.

My friend is a nice guy, but quite frankly he's not smart enough to have
come up with that scenario on his own ... he had to have read it in a trade
rag or heard it at a conference somewhere.

FWIW .. again, take that with a grain of salt.
