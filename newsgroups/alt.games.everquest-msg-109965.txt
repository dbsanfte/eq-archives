How do you define "most adapted"? (perhaps you mean "most [effectively]
adapted [to current conditions]" which would be pretty much what Darwin
was writing about).  Now tell me how you are going to define, describe,
and validate this concept except in terms of observed survival?  I'm
not arguing the basic premise of evolution of species, I'm saying that
the oft used phrase "survival of the fittest" is equivalent to the
phrase "survival of the survivors" and suffers from a severe information
content deficit.

I can see no possible use for the phrase except as a clumsy way to
define fitness.
