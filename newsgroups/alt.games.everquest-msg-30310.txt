I hear what you're saying but its a case of generally believing the
most specific claim...

If company A says "Product X works great for Y not so well for Z"

and company Z says "Our product is directly compatible with Product X"

then my assumption, as a consumer, would be that company Z has made
the efforts to overcome Product X's generic weakness at Z.

Just because X is generally weak at Z doesnt imply that a product of 
category Z specifically designed to work on X will work badly.

Of course, as someone once said, assumption just makes an ass out of u 
and mption ;) As you've pointed out, in this case believing company Z may
not have been the brightest of moves....
