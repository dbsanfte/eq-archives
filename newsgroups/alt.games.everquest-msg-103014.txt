Well at least it only "seemed" that way.  I "know" that my regular
warrior does this on purpose hehe.

Depending on situation I may just stand there till warrior taunts it
off, root park  it to the side, or sometimes root it on the warrior
<eg>.

This is going to depend a lot on level.  Before you have complete heal
spreading the heals out keeps agro lower and when working from the top
of the mana tank allows you to start medding sooner.  Once you have CH
getting the most bang for your buck is the plan.  Two bubbles is about
the earliest I'll start a CH for normal fights and just like my warrior
friend likes to pull on top of medding folks, I like to see just how low
I can get his hp before that CH hits <eg>.

cleric begins to cast a spell
melee is healed
cleric:hit  it!
cleric:hit it again!!
cleric:parry! dodge!!
melee:sorry
