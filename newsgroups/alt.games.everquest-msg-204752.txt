Go to someplace like Halas, WFP under Arcane Scientists, Felwithe,
etc. where there are no hostiles.  Get in the water, looking up
(that's the key to not drowning), move away from shore, hold down
both your forward and either left or right keys so you're swimming
in a tight circle, hit enter, release the movement keys, hit enter
again, pull out a book, glance at the screen every once in a while
to check whether you've maxed your skill (std cap for most races:
level*5+5) and perhaps to forage (use F9 to get remote view, easier
to look at).
