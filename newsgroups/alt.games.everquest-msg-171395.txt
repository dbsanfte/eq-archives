Decide. Do you want to be popular in ALL of Freeport, or just bank? If 
you want all of freeport, don't hand in any belts. Sell them for plat.

Go through Allakhazam and see what quests and mobs to kill that affect 
your Freeport faction.

As a Dark Elf necro, I was dubious in Freeport E & W and KOS in N. 
Freeport. I killed a lot of orcs and did Jenam and Rebby quests until 
they loved me everywhere but the bard guild and the Church.
