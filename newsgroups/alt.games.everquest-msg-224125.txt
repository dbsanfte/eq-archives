With my cleric I like to announce most of the spells I am casting in
group channel (some groups don't like it but my regulars do)

Only problem is that if you change spell sets the announcement is
often wrong, go to cast a root but the message says "Healing a
<whatever>".

The way I have my macros set up is to have 1 to 8 as

/g <message if required>
/cast 1
/pause 10
/cast 1

The /pause 10 and then recast usually gets around the <you are
interupted> type messages and often helps with fizzles

I also have macro slot 10 set up with something like
/g Learning buffs
/memspellset Buffs

And then have 3 sets of macros on set 1-3 for Heals/Buffs/Utility with
the right /g <message> for each spell in that set.

Any one else use something similar? And if not, how do you set your
spells up?
