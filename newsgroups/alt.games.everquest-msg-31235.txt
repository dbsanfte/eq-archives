Just a couple of days ago I had my level 14 druid in Rivervale.  I needed to
go to Qeynos and it was midnight.  The distance to HP isn't much and I guess
I've done it too many times during the day and got cocky.  As soon as I
stepped out of the tunnel, 2 very large, very red skeletons cruised by me.
I was sowed  up so I ran.  Saw another skeleton on the path.  Tried a detour
but he saw me.  A wandering warrior.  Hit me for, if I remember right, 93
points, kicked me for 9.  He missed on the second whack.  I hit the zone.  I
was shaking.  From now on, I can wait for 9am.

And North Karana stills scares me, night or day.
