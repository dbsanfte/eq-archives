Bugs on your server is called NG on Morell Thule, and probably other things on
other servers.

Funny how moving from one server to another opens up your eyes to this sort of
thing, I remember "first rock" and "second rock" on Luclin being called "P1 and
P2" on MT, really confused me... but P1 was shorter to type so it didn't take
long to learn.

NG is also shorter than Bugs, though not by nearly as much.
