Question now is, exactly how much of a pain in the ass is it to kill

There are a ton of fun foods (champagne, meat fillets, cheese, cream,
creamy fennel sauce, absinthe, fizzlepop, seafood salad, halas meat
pie, new cakes) and some interesting quests - even though some of the
rewards are less than impressive, the imbued version of the high elf
cultural infused tunic (the one that needs a blue diamond) gives the
following:
Blessed Artkeeper's Tunic 
AC 15, STA 5, INT 15, HP 40, mana 40, wt 3.0 
MAG, WIZ, ENC; HIE, HUM - Tunare only 
I hope there is a version of wood elf cultural that requires infused
studs/boning and gives nice gear; it'd give me an incentive to try to
grand master tailoring after all.

I'll check felines next time I see one.
