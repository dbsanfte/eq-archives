For that, /disc furious (autoriposte) would seem the better choice, no?
6 seconds of frontal damage immunity, plus additional attacks right at
the time you need to build agro.

Depending on the situation, I've used both. I rarely bother with
defensive on bosses these days.

OK, I've heard this before in support of our defensive gimick. How does
this work?  Do CHes for less cost less mana? Do MTs get healed less
often at the start of a fight when they're defensive?

Been in the channel once. Turned the conversation to Olsen Twins pr0n
within 30 seconds and left, never to return. Aparently they carried on
for hours. I prefer channels that offer a decent challenge );oP

Seriously though, from what I've heard it just seems to be a stats and
item swapping channel, together with a lot of misinformation. Warrior,
more than any other class, like to show off their feathers and drag.
