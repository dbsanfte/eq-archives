Very odd how the "middle easten" people arrested near by who
were apparently celebrating the attack turned out to be Israeli
though...

None of the alleged hijackers were Palestinian, since several of
them have subsequently turned up alive and apparently the victims
of identity theft we don't really know who carried out these attacks.

This list of those probably capable of doing so includes both
American and Israeli organisations.

There was plenty of speculation on this in the press around mid
September. To be honest no one really knows.

Either way you'd probably have ended up with destroyed buildings,
Israel appears to have blown up just about anything paid for by 
any kind of foreign aid.

As can the money the US spent to kill people in Afganistan and the
money the US spends to keep Israel armed.

It is not justified, however it is understandable, considering
the provocation they face.

I wonder if those people excusing Israel would have been excusing
Germany 60 odd years ago.
