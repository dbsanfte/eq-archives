Maybe at higher levels feeding the Cleric mana is worth it - I
wouldn't know yet though.  Based on some of the figures I've just seen
posted, it doesn't *seem* worth it at higher levels either, but I can
only find this out for sure by getting to a higher level and trying
it, I suppose  :)  I've had a quick look at the spells, and if I was
lvl 59, the expense of 1200 mana over 3 ticks to give the Cleric a
measly 450 mana sure doesn't seem worth it at first glance... One
thing IS certain, though: I play EQ for fun and excitement, and I
*don't* intend to sit on my arse, watching my pet tank, standing up
only to drain whatever mana I have into the Cleric and keep him/her/it
happy.  Fun?  Excitement?  I think not!

That aside, however, feeding the Cleric mana at my levels IS futile -
I tried it out, and even the Cleric herself thought it a waste of
time.  At lvl 37, it costs ME 200 mana to give the equivalent Cleric a
mere 60 mana.  If I do this 3 times, the Cleric is STILL 5 mana points
short of (for the sake of argument) a single Superior Heal, but lets
say after that the cleric hasn't hit rock-bottom and has 5 mana to get
the heal off...  OK, great, I suppose - but, frankly, if the cleric
has allowed themselves to get so low on mana that they feel doing THAT
will help them in a crisis, I want a better cleric!  That's what
med-breaks are for.  I've got better things to do with my 600 mana,
such as kill the mob, fear it, root it, "pseudo-mezz" it with
Screaming Terror, and so on.  I'll probably have a better use for my
1200 mana at lvl 59, too, heh, but as to that I cannot say.

Very true at my levels.  At the level the OP's Cleric is, I concede it
*might* well be different then, but I'd still much rather go for DPS
too.  A group that can combine their various specialities to kill a
mob in 20 seconds is going to need a hell of a lot of less Healing
than a group who kills the mob in 40 or 60.
