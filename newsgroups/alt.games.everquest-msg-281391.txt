No, you have one character for the group, and plan when you will all be
on to play externally to the game. Just like any other RPG.

I play with a small group. We plan ahead of time when we will meet. If
someone decides they're not happy with the character they have, they
let at least one other in the group know so proper arrangements to get
the new character up with the rest of the group can be made. It's a
little different there from a paper and dice game in that you can't
just roll up a new character of the appropriate level, sure, but far
from unmaintainable and doesn't rely on bots or purchasing.

Xiphos - I recently decided I didn't like the barbarian zerker I had
for the group. Planned out an Iksar necro, took the week to get him in
line with the rest of the group, then good to go from there.
