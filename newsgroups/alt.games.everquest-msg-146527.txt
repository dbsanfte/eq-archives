Anyone maintain sites with pictures of your own journies in EQ? I haven't been in 
long and probably don't take enough screenshots, but I've put the few that I have 
thus far available at www.thalunatik.com/eq

At first I had the title of the page as "Tha*Lunat!k's EverQuest Exploits" (as in 
journeys) but someone misunderstood and thought I was hacking... lol
