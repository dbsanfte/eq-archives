Oddly ive never had aany problem with boats, other than when I had a really
slow computer I used to have to jump ship after it had docked... it took me
so long to zone. A least the ship was still in zone to jump off!
Ive solved all my boat problems now, at least for my binding characters, by
binding in the firepot room in TD. The only place thats a hassle to get to
now is velious.
