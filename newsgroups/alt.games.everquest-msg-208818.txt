Hi,

Is anybody else out there having problems with NTL's cable modem service?  
For some time now my connection has been crap - every 30 secs or so my ping 
shoots up to 3K+ for about 15-45 secs.  Packet loss is also in double 
figures a lot of the time, though it's the ping time which is killing me 
(literally!) and I'm fed up with all the deaths and resulting xp loss.  Just 
wondered if anybody else was having similar probs.

Thanks,

Mike
