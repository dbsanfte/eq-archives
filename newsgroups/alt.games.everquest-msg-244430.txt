So we are making the case that Everquest represents a league overseen
by Sony Online Entertainment and bound by the EULA 'rules'? That
analogy seems a much better fit to Sony's rights to restrict access
than playing the copyright/intellectual property game. Yes.. under
that philosophy I would agree that Sony has the right to sanction
players based on conduct should they become aware of it, regardless on
if the money-transaction took place off server, and really have no
recourse against those persons involved with no access to their
server. Furthermore, it would not constitute anything 'illegal',
especially when it comes to IP/copyright 'illegal' arguments as put
forth by Dark Tyger, they don't apply.
