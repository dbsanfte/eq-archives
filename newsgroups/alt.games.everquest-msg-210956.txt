Not that I'm aware of. 
Apart from level, it also depends on group dynamics which depends
firstly on the skill of each player, then on how well they group. Then
there is an element of luck.

All it takes is for mezz to slip, the warriors to loose aggro and you
can have a badly wounded cleric who is more concerned with healing self
than warriors and that lack of mana and concentration means death.

Or, someone love taps Rook and the fight is on. Cleric is OOMing, MT is
going down and suddenly you realise Secondary Tank is/has been AFK (no
hits & 100% health) - seen this happen too many time. Is that person
going to come back from AFK, take and hold aggro and have enough HP to
finish off Rook?

Does your group fight to the death, or RUN for zone at what %?

Give it a try.
