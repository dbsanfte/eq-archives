First off, anyone who belongs to group 3, as you describe it, is deluded. My
primary is a 29th level druid: she can make as much experience in a small group
(one or two, generally tanks) in the same several hours as soloing because she
can take higher level creatures faster than she could all by herself.

And you omit a fourth group, those who simply prefer to play alone.

A question: why is it evil for one person to take a camp spot, and not evil for
a group to take the same camp spot? You answer this elsewhere, so I will
respond there.

Thoughts on what?
