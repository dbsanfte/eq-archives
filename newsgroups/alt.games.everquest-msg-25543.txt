 Simple. 
 
 Put in place a level limit for your guild. Start it at something like
level 24, let all persons/chars under that level stay but encourage
level advancment. Occasionally raise the level limit for new recruits.
Keep it going up and encourage all members to keep leveling, leveling
and leveling. Keep raising the level limit occasionally until you get
the guild up to the average level desired. Actively search for and
recruit players of equal or higher level.
