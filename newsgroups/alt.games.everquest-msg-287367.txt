I really don't see any impact from LoN. As a matter of fact, with the
cards dropping in the game, I've considered checking it out. I kind of
liked Magic the Gathering, though I never really played it much. I
could see where an EQ-themed game of that type would appeal to me. I
don't think it affects my experience in EQ, though. /shrug

They're doing something right, alright. It's called appealing to the
drooling masses (no offense to those upstanding, well-educated folk
who also enjoy WoW). I've often referred to WoW as the "cotton candy"
of MMORPG's. Some people really love the taste and just eat it all the
time. Others really like it at first but can only stomach so much.
Others just don't care for cotton candy. In any case, substantive is
most definitely not a term that should be used to describe it. It is
what it is, something simple and fun that appeals to a lot of people.
Chess and Monopoly appeal to a lot of people as well, but I wouldn't
pay a monthly fee to play them. ;)

Yeah, I thought the energetic stuff was kind of lame.

Complexity I like. It can make for a more rich game world and more
involving player experience. However, complexity for the sake of
itself it just a bad idea. I agree with you in that I just don't think
they needed to go there at that point. Deteriorating items have never
been a part of EQ. I don't understand why they feel that's a viable
game element.

Well, I don't find it to be all *that* bleak. Sure, the population is
dwindling, but there is a difference between that trend in EQ vs. the
same in UO. I knew people who continued to play UO for years after it
was already considered washed up. They each only continued to play it
because it was free to play (on the shards they played on, anyway).
They didn't see any other MMORPG's worthy of a monthly fee. My brother
was one of those people. However, when I bought him the SoF box, he
gave it a try and was immediately hooked.

My point is, while the EQ population is a fraction of what it once
was, the people who still play are generally very enthusiastic about
the game - enough so to continue to pay a monthly fee, even though it
is largely considered well past its prime. Most of us have tried most
of the other MMORPG's that have come along over the past several
years, each time eventually returning to EQ.

WoW is doing something right, but it's not doing EQ, and that's what
keeps this group of players coming back. SoE needs to recognize that.
