I've tried those so-called "real" newsreaders and e-mail clients.  They
suffer from a bulky interface, and some usability issues (Agent, for
example, tends to fill up some file somewhere that I can't figure out how to
empty, so I've got to reinstall every few days).  Sure, OE has it's issues,
but it seems the lesser of two evils... and this is from an Opera user.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
