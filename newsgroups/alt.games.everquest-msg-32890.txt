As a DE, your hide skill won't go up until level 11...you can do it,
and it'll work sometimes, but you won't get skill increases until then.

First thing I do when I level after getting a quiet moment is standing
somewhere with something targeted, and practicing Sneak, Hide,
Sense Heading, Sense Traps, and Instill Doubt until they all max
out.  If your sneak skill only has worked a couple of times, practice
more. As your skill goes up, so will the successes.

The good thing is, sneak can be practiced anywhere (except it cannot
be STARTED in the water).  On that long run through Nek or
the Commons, practice sneak every time it un-greys.  If successful,
hit it again to un-sneak...your skill should go up pretty quick with a DE's
(a REAL dark elf ;-)  ) intelligence.

Good luck to you!
