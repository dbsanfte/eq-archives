Another meaningless flame.  I just remembered people like you're the reason
I quit doing usenet 3 years ago.  Hello login server congestion?  Backbone
latency?  I guess if you knew what that was you wouldn't be posting, eh?

I don't have time to hammer the connect button for 10 minutes straight to

play and leave you to bickering.  Go pick on someone else.
