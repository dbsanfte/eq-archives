Your post, particularly the "rude and greedy not to donate an
acceptable amount" bit.

I don't know that it has become bad to sell them.  I still see people
regularly selling ports, for a set price, on Xegony.

If the porter in question isn't willing to just come out and tell the
person how much they want for a port, then no, it isn't wrong.  If
you're going to leave it up to the people who want the port, you have
to realize that they are probably going to try and make the best deal
for themselves that they can.  Which is ok, because it's not really
other players responsibilty to watch out for YOUR finances.

Bullshit.  If you want 15pp for a port, say so.  Saying "Porting for
donations" implies that the porter will take what the portee can
afford.  And sometimes, it's not 15pp.  Hell, sometimes they might
just not WANT to donate 15pp.  And since the price of the service has
been left up to the portee, no one is to blame for that but the porter
in question.

You WANT 15 plat for a port, ask for it.  

Let me reiterate here that my main is a level 52 druid.

>You know what common courtesy/going rate dictates. To pay less is

How are you taking advantage of anybody?  To be perfectly honest, 15pp
to port to anyplace other then IC, GD, or maybe even WL, is highway
robbery.  The port in anywhere else is perfectly safe, for the porter
anyway, and once you get over level 40ish, it's not even all THAT much
of a mana drain.

Once again, if a porter wants 10, 15, or 20pp for a port, they need to
balls up and ask for it.  This whole "donation" racket is a gaint
crock of shit.
