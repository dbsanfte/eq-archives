I totally agree.  My cleric made it to 59 in an incredibly short time.  Not
power leveling, playing in LDON.  She met up with a nice group of people early
on and we just LOVED the dungeons and the next thing I knew she passed up my
ranger (main).  
The true *newbies* my cleric started with *are* in a world of hurt for gear
now.

Healea Sternstar - 59 cleric
Skila Windrunner - 57 ranger
Jennaii - 45 druid
Linni - 31 shaman
Stormfoot - 31 warrior
Deatha - 26 necro
Tholuxe Paells
