Ah, you're probably right. I just know the druids /ooc PoG, and all the
casters in my group disband hehe

Every buff can probably fall under that same description. In a 20 minute
fight like Vuulak, that's a lot of mana. Even on fights you might
actually lose, every little helps. OK, so it's not a wiz chaining
Dragonsbane, a MT with /disc up, or a clutch of clerics, but it
certainly has a requested place. Same with Pally DS - maybe not make or
break except for that one time you really need it... I've been in near
wipeouts before where a medding cleric got a CH on me at under a bub hps
after having to med the last ounce of mana. A second later would've
meant a long CR.

Add to that the new mob resist changes coming in, and there'll be more
mobs they can actually nuke effectively.

When you only have a small window for CR or to pull a mob, casting once
rather than 5 times makes a difference, and for resistances on high
damage AEs, you never can tell whether that extra 5 resistance might've
just saved your life...

The shaman have their hands full: slowing, loading, ressing. Also, their
best heal is bad for a tank because of the slow/snare effect. With the
clerics focussing on the MT, paladin's meleeing and watching for LoH
emergencies, druids do a great job of keeping robes from falling to
smaller AEs.

No classes are 'useless' on raids. Necros and enchanters have a HELL of
a lot more to complain about regarding 'in fight' usefulness than
druids.

Hopefully the adjustments to mob resistances are being done to target
that problem
