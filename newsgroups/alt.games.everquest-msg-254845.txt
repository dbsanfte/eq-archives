Subject: Responsibility in Impossible LDON Group?

I joined a LDON yesterday.  MT was from guild X.  The other 4 (including the
group leader) were from Guild Y.  When I joined the group it was MT, GL and me.
 I immediately asked if we needed more, as I had friends and guildies of my own
on.  He said no, others were OTW.  22 minutes later the last one arrived.  (I
love the buff timer.   No more wondering how long you've been sitting around
doing nothing.)  
Anyway, within 5 pulls MT and I knew we were in trouble.  The chanter couldn't
get anything mezzed and the secondary tank had already gone AFK twice.  On the
6th pull the MT went down, I ran and zoned.  After getting him rezzed the MT
said he had to join his guildies and left.  The secondary tank had crap armor
and was still AFK.  
At what point is it acceptable to just say "guys, this isn't going to work. 
I'm outa here".  As cleric I feel I have an obligation to a group, especially
in LDON, but where do you draw the line?
