Wrong.  While you're not the only one who feels as you do, you are part
of a tiny minority (at least in my experience which includes encounters
with thousands of other characters over thye last three years).  Smart
people consider that public channels annoy lots of people and rarely
get results while sending a polite /tell to somebody you can see is not
in combat rarely offends anybody and almost always gets results, and
the choice of approach is easy.
