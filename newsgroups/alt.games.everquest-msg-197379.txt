Oh, the irony. ;)  Someone claiming that listening to people discuss an

done it saying "talk is cheap."

And this is the eletist attitude that you denied having.   The opinion that
every guild should be a raiding guild dedicated to power and phat lewt.
That there is no place for a guild that is a collection of friends who just
like to play with each other.   Anyone who is in the second guild, the
family style guild, would remain stuck in the first four zones of the
expansion, from the moment they passed 61.  Only a small amount of them
become able to pass the trials, and then they are faced with a decision.
Spend all thier time trying to powerlevel the rest of the guild past the
trials (in many cases characters who are just not ready for the next zones)
or go off by themselves, with thier small little group.   It forces a
division which becomes a major problem in a lot of those guilds.

Are you leveling up, or helping people pass the trials?   You can't do both
at once, and in many cases we're talking about people with limited playtime.

If you do "concentrate on leveling up" then those who are not flagged get
the perception that you don't care they're not flagged, and leads to talk
like you mentioned earlier...

What you're describing is the rumblings of the unflagged, who feel that the
others, by improving themselves in thier small group, don't care about them.
And whether the original intent was to level up and help people out, or just
to have a break and have some fun for a while, it becomes a self fuffilling
prophecy.  At least with me, the more I was flamed over how "unhelpful" I
was acting, the less inclined I was to go way out of my way to help them.  I
really don't appreciate being taken for granted.

No.  You don't just wander into Vex Thall and outfit the guild on a couple
Saturday afternoon armor farms.  You're talking about a slow, methodical
build up of several months of raids before you're even ready to attempt to
get the gear we're discussing.  And a guildwide power level that is much
greater than what actually exists in these guilds. As I said before, all
guilds are not either uber or wannabe-uber raiding guilds.

Even if the guild does have enough members to pull off such raids (You're no
longer talking single group here like the trials, but a large, and active
raiding force, where every member is well equipped..)  many of those members
don't have the desire to do so.  If they wanted to raid constantly, for the
most part, they would have joined a raiding guild, not a family guild.

You're also in a situation now where unrestricted access for just your guild
is unreasonable.  Instead you're dealing with highly contested mobs on week
long spawn timers.  The ubers and wannabe-ubers aren't likely to give up
thier weekly item farms, just becuase your family guild decided to give it a
go suddenly.

The mental block is that in most family guilds, the ones having the most
problems with this, it *just doesn't work that way.*   If they can get past
the trials

That would be the beginning of the downside.   Thats the whole point, the
trials and flagging system as they are now are prone to create or exacerbate
existing differences, to the point where the guild splits.   It becomes a
case of the haves, those who are flagged, vs. the have-nots, those too low
level,  unequipped, of an incorrect class, or for whatever reason cannot
make it past the trials.  It breeds resentment among those who feel they are
being left behind, which is mirrored in the reactions of those who are the
target of the resentment.

And in pre-emptive response to the comment you will of course make... "I
guess you must not have been a very good guild then.  A good guild would not
have had these problems."  No, we were not perfect.   We had our problems,
just as EVERY guild does.  But for the most part we were always able to work
through them and remain good friends that still wanted to enjoy each others
company.  The flagging system may not have been the root cause, but in our
case, and from what I've been hearing, in a great many other cases, it was
definitely the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak.  "Now we
can't even play together?  What is the point of this guild then? .... Well,
it's your fault we can't play together, if you would just do the trials for
everyone then we could!...  (degenerate into flaming from here)"

You've been repeating yourself.   The problem is that you haven't been
listening to the responses, which are also beginning to get repeated.

Fine.  Then let me focus on the heart of my opinion.

It is when it effectively limits a great deal of your playerbase to *four*
massively overcrowded zones.   As for the tedious comment...  this is one of
the parts I really feel you aren't getting.   The trials, as implemented,
were NOT breaks in the tedium of leveling, they were the very definition of
tedium, in and of themselves.  They were worse than the "tedium of
leveling."   I can at least vary that, by hunting in several different
places (unless, of course, I'm confined to only four zones).  They were
sitting in the same zone, hour after hour, day after day waiting in the same
line, attempting the same encounter until you finally managed to get past
it.

As an optional side encounter, with a moderate reward for successfully
completing it (which coincidently, sounds like exactly what they are making
it into.. unless the whiners saying "they've already been rewarded enough"
get listened to.)  then it would be a great change of pace, and something
fun to do.   As a forced bottleneck and roadblock to the vast majority of
the exp giving content for every post 60-player, they absolutely suck.
Hard.




> 2. The current solution should be fixed, not removed.

And the best "fix" would be to make them optional.   Which you appear to
classify as "removal."

I don't mind that they're challenging.   Even if it's difficult to the point
that they need specialized groups with planning and execution to succeed.
What I do mind is that for a player unable to pass them, they are
*incredibly* limiting.  If you cannot pass them, then until you do you are
limited to a grand total of *four* zones.  Compare that to the number of
zones that your level 40 self can go to to get good or at least decent
experience.   I once did that for level 60.  I don't remember the exact
number or the post, but I believe it worked out to about sixteen different
zones (Not counting the four PoP planes) that you could go to and get decent
expereince in.   Yet from almost the moment you ding 61, it drops to four
zones.  Until you pass the trials.  (and even then it only goes up to 6.)

Once agian, how exactly do you suggest that this be accomplished?  Once
again, I'll offer for example the guild I was in.

(old post)
For some guilds this isn't an issue.  Everyone does the trials in Justice,
with a few extra runs so the groups doing it can be balanced.   For ours it
was.   We had a *lot* of high 50's and barely 60 characters that became that
level not because they played as much... but because they had been playing
casually for three years or more.  What happened was the heavy players like
myself zoomed up to 63, 64 and 65 right away, and needed to move on.   Most
of the rest did not.   So we ended up with a guild that was half "average
level 64", and half "average level 58"
(/old post)

Telling people to "play more often and level up - now" is not a realistic
option.

Neither is the option you seem to suggest often, recruit more members which
are able to pass the trials.   We were a family guild.   We just wanted to
have fun playing together with our friends, inviting complete strangers to
join the guild solely to fill out trial or raid slots would have been
completely opposite to our entire purpose.  It's not the kind of guild we
were, nor was it the kind we wished to become.

Whats left, enforced powerleveling?  Not going to happen.   Sharing accoutns
so the active players get exp on the less active accounts?  Again, no chance
in hell.


> If your guild lacks the equipment
> to attempt the trials, work hard on obtaining what you need.

In other words, your guild should become a raiding guild, whether that is
what the members want or not.

As a guild, if we didn't raid all the time we would never get the phat lewt.
Those that couldn't accept it either moved on to a raiding guild or found
other ways to deal with it.  (Myself and several others were extremely
active in public raids against high profile targets.)   As a guild, we did
not want to be a raiding guild, few of our members could make the time
required to do so, even if they wanted to.  We knew what it meant in terms
of loot, and accepted that.   What I could not accept was that such a
decision will lead to a post 60 career locked into *four little zones.*

(Yes, I do keep coming back to that.   As I said, it was a major issue for
me.)

One of the reasons I'm getting so sick of hearing this is because it just
plain isn't true.   You've been particularly critical of my (former) guild
in this respect.  The perception of people being unwilling to spend any time
helping (based on lack of production of flags in any meaningful numbers) was
rampant.  But actual people who never, ever helped.... I'm having trouble
thinking of one.  Even among those that I *did* consider selfish players,
(cases where you say "Who the hell let that one in?"), I can't think of
anyone that didn't go down to help at least sometimes.

You seem to be wanting to paint this in terms of absolutes.  This is one of
the reasons that most of your theories fell apart in the "real world"
conditions that I experienced.

Everything is possible.  It's possible that a level 1 will find a way to
solo Vox someday.  What you have appeared to be arguing is that this is the
way it happens, more often than not.   If you're merely arguing that
something is "not impossible"... then this whole discussion is pretty
meaningless.
