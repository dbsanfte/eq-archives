I had never considered Premium either but after reading the Yantis
thread I decided to sign up, as Alla may be the last defense against
Yantis's taking over of other EQ sites. It cost 29.99/year, or 9.99/3
months. I'd rather see Alla have the money to pick up eq sites that the
owner is tired of than Yantis.
