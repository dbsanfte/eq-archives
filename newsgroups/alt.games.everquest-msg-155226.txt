For a soloing monk bandaging makes the down time fly past. Less down time =
faster xp. I agree run is it for for others but with fd in your pocket and a
heap of bandages then soling is so much easier, you also get to keep your
mend for the fight. After bandage? Well run ofcourse ;)

If you group more than solo then it should be run frst as that way you can
pull in doors when that pesky sow wears off.
