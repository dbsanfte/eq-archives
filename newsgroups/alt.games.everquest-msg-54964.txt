I never go anon and as a lvl 55 Enchanter i get tells from every continent
in the zone asking if I ould be interested in <insert help with epic, raid,
etc.>

They were looking for a warrior, did a /who warrior all and spotted you in
enxt zone and asked you to join them. You would have got better exp going to
The Overthere than staying at FM fort and you should be happy about people
inviting you.
