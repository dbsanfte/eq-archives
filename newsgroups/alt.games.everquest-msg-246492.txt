For me, the CoH beta-test chinched it...
I was becomming somewhat disillusioned with EQ lately anyway (I play a 60ish
druid), so I was looking for something to fill the void.
I started EQ at the same time as some friends, but since they had more time
to devote, they rocketed past me, and within a week, they were too high to
group with me.
Generally, when I logged on, I'd only have an hour or two I could play
before real life came calling.  Ever since the mid-40s, when I log on, it
takes almost that long just to find a group, with or without the /lfg tool.
(I know, druids can solo, but you can only kite for so long before it
becomes work).

In CoH, I can log on, hit "seek team", and usually get an invite within
minutes.  My supergroup (guild) & friends, once again, are considerably
higher than I am, but in CoH, I can become someone's "sidekick", which
temporarily boosts me to their level - 1.  Combine that with the drastically
reduced downtime, compared to EQ, and so far, it looks like we have a
contender.  Granted, there is less content, at this point, but look how much
EQ had when it launched.

I'm hanging on to EQ at least until the EQ2 launch, but from what I've
heard, I'm not expecting much aside from pretty graphics.
