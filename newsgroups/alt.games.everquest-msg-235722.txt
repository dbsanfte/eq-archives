To be sure. But your projecting that onto him. Its not evident that is
what he looking for. I agree its possible... but that hardly makes it
a forgone conclusion. A few of my friends have been subjected to
"personality tests" to get a crappy retail job... I think its stupid.

 But its too ubiquitous to be considered sinister at face value.

Having been through it myself,  I think the public education system
sucks. Perhaps home schooling is a good idea... I'm certainly not
going to discount it.

As to the kids living on the farm forever... that was an option, not a
requirement. 

As to the kids not needing a formal education...  Its something I
personally don't hold with *at all*, personally beleiving that
education is one of the most important things we can give our
children...  but that doesn't make me "right". And fwiw if the kids do
decide to stay on the farm, some reading and math will suffice.

And to be cynical: half the kids that graduate don't have much of an
education either, and seem to get along ok in the world. I'm sure
you've seen the appalling literacy statistics for american
graduates... maybe a little homeschooling will actually put them ahead
of the curve.

>He 
>does have an awful lot of contradictory statements throughout.

There is quite a big topic summed up on fewer than 10 pages. With a
dissertation that brief I take contradictions as a sign that there is
quite a bit of wiggle room; that the condtradictions imply that many
of his statements  aren't statements of absolutes.

>have to be religious to be a cult.

True. But there are no obvious tell-tales at all. There are no
isolationist or overt control objectives. The premise is mutual
consent to the program, freedom to leave, and no obligation to sever
ties or forfiet possessions.

What red flags. I'm curious what you see.

To me the biggest red flag is his website itself, that he is seeking
his partners via the web and little cards he apparently hands out. But
who am i to judge... I have the same disbeleif that to find a partner
people use dating services, personal ads in the paper,  chat-lines,
and in Japan: little shortwave devices that beep when someone nearby
is determined to be compatible according some programmed profile...

That he has nudes of himself online I find pretty disturbing too...
but I'm net savvy enough to know that the number of "amateurs" with
nude pictures on the web is enough to populate a country... I don't
understand it or agree with it... but who am I to judge it. America's
issues with nudity are just as likely to be the sign of a repressed
self-acceptance issue as pinning the crazyness on the exhibitionists.

Normal is relative to where your standing. And you can always rely on
the medical establishment to label each deviation from normal,
prescribe a treatment for it, and comfort those closest to accepted
normal with accolades to their well-adjustedness.

If being normal means to subscribe to capitalism without conscious,
celebrity worship, and all the other bullshit that goes for normal
right now, I'm pleased to count myself abnormal. ;)

> Seriously, if you can't recognize how fucked in the 
>head this guy probably is, 

He's different I can see that. He wants to create a different kind of
society; he recognizes the ones we've invented so far are pretty
shoddy. That doesn't make him a dangerous crackpot. I personally
disagree with some of his ideas...but I don't see it as inherently
dangerous or crazy.

He *might* be crazy. But its not a necessary condition to explain his
plan.

Have you perchance read Henry David Thoreau's "Walden Pond"?

Thoreau postulates a retreat from civilization as a sustainable way to
live life, and in fact, derive more pleasure from it.  His work is
recognized as brilliant.... Was he too a crackpot? I'm sure a mental
health profession could find any number of conditions to ascribe to
someone fleeing civilization...

Had he sought a longer term project (his was just for a year or so)
and wanted a partner in his endeavour, he might have resorted to
poster's that look a little like this guys website.

>I strongly urge some relationship counseling 
>so you don't end up a bitter, lonely misogynist.

You are aware misogyny is the hatred of women? 
I fail to see the application??

For what its worth I'm happily married.
