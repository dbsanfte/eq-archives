Bloodgills in LoIO will  take you to 51 or 52 if you don't mind some
light blues mixed in. Burning Woods is also not bad at that lvl, you
just have to make sure you know what lvl mobs to attack, either trail
and error or check the web. Some of the higher lvl blues will own you
at that lvl but some of the lower end stuff is great exp. ... maybe KC
if you don't mind pulling the moat and are selective as to your
targets.
