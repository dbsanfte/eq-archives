Playing an EQ character, though, is a lot simpler than being a doctor.  For
instance, a friend of mine only played one character past 20.  That was a
level 60 Cleric in an uberguild (Legacy of Steel).  He took over a level 60
Enchanter a couple of times when the owner of that character had to leave an
event early, and had no problems.  Just observing how Enchanters played over
the course of getting his Cleric to level 60  gave him enough knowledge to
be an OK 60 Enchanter at uber events.  The only thing that was hard, he told
me, was that he didn't know the spell icons, so he was a little slower at
finding things in the spellbook.

A large fraction of what it takes to be a good EQ player is not really class
specific, so much of it transfers, so my friend could be a good Enchanter.
He wasn't a great Enchanter, fo course...but it would not have taken him a
long time to become a great one.
