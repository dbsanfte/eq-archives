I wasn't commenting on your original post at all, just on your
complaint that Kaev's response was off topic.  You might
disagree with his point, but his point was in fact clearly
a reply to your post.  Spot on target.

I'm not hassling you.  Really.  Just poking my nose in as sort
of a moderator.  Imagine you are at a tennis match, and you
take a shot, Kaev hits it back, and you think it went out of
bounds and yell Fault.  Well think of me as the ref.  Ball was
in bounds, I point out, rolling back the tape.  Fortunately,
unlike a tennis match, you don't lose the point, that ball is
still in the air, hit it back if you don't like what he was saying.

Transitive verb, I say.  You were making a point with no
personal stake in the matter.  I see you as complaining
about how poorly this was done, Despite the fact that
it doesn't actually affect you.  Kaev sees it as bitching
about decisions VI made (whether or not they affect
you personally.)  And all three are words meaning
the same thing only with a different flavor.

Surely you've played this game before?  The english
language is full of them.  I'm heavyset, you are
overweight, he's fat.  I'm prudent, you are cautious,
he's a coward.  Worry about the content, don't
get distracted by the emotional loading, its an easy
way to distract you from the meat of the debate.
