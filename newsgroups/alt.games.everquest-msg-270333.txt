Good point.

I tried it out with some summoned WR bags, and the one that had
something in it was replaced with a bags with the same number of
slots, no WR, and weight 25.  Seems fair.  I did notice that the
replacement bag only held up to Large items, where I thought the
original could've held Giant.  I'll have to go find a Giant item
I can try to leave in a summoned bag.  Hm, what's a giant item
that I'm willing to lose if something goes wrong?  Ah, a Black
Ceremonial Coffin looks like it qualifies...
