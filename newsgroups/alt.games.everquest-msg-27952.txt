Yeah, never mind actually killing the AoW, he's just a rather large
and difficult container to get phat lewts from...

What the fuck is wrong with all you uberguild people - some of you
take down the greatest challenges in the game, get some damned nice
stuff and COMPLAIN that it's too weak compared to effort and should be
even nicer? What would it take to please you, a ring with +50 to every
stat and +100 to all saves, effect: ability_to_use_GM_commands? 
(Meanwhile, I'm 46 and still hunt mobs for exp that drop a few silver
and rusty weapons from time to time.)

I think it'd do you good if you could have even a slight roleplay
perspective of the GAME you're supposedly playing.
