I have not noticed any problem with my dialup connection regarding
Everquest and I have expansions up to GoD. I usually get a 49.2 kbps
connect to my ISP though it can be as low as 33.6 kpbs. There have
been times when I have been disconnected though the problems often
seem to be that my link to the ISP has gone bad even though I am still
connected (it appears) or network congestion (more rarely) as I have
seen massive data transfers AFTER I got disconnected. Admittedly it
can get quite frustrating.

EQ is supposed to be playable over a minimum 28.8 connection and my
experience has been positive in that regard.

Another possibility might be that LDoN involves more processing/load,
or maybe the effects of DX9, is using up more cpu time. Now if you
have an internal modem that is software based then the ability of the
modem to maintain a connection at a given speed will vary depending on
the load on the cpu. If the cpu can't handle the modem processing too,
then the modem steps down the connection to what it can handle.

Of course, if you have a hardware based internal or an external modem
(which would be hardware based) or you have a powerful cpu then
disregard.

Good luck.
