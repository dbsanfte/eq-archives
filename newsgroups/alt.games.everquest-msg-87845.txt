Bad analogy....

"No Shoes, No Shirt, No Service"
I have enforced this (long ago when I was assistant manager at a fast
food chain).

As an Auto-Mechanic (6 years ago) I kicked a guy out of the shop I was
working in when he called me a cheat and a liar after he car failed a
smog test.

"Refusing Service" is done in business all the time. Obviously, as
noted above, you cannot use race/religion/sex/etc as a reason.
Customers have no "right" to act like assholes or abuse the staff of
any business or organization.
