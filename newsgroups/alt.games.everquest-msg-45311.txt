I've spent a -lot- ( horrible understatement ) of time in QHills in the
recent past and have seen many different druids kiting the Millers.  I woul
trade Breeze and SoW with them when I was taking down Pyzjn.

The druids ranged in levels from about 27 - 32, and not -once- did I see
them double-kiting.  I can't tell you why, though.  Maybe it was the
wandering guards or Niclaus that they were worried about.  Dunno.  If I were
killing them with a Druid and could double-kite them, -I- would.
