I've always found it quicker to zone *the other way* out of BB, run
across Qeynos Hills, West Karana, North Karana, East Karana, Highpass,
Kithicor, West Commons, East Commons, North Ro and Oasis, catch the boat
from Oasis out to Timorous deep, swim to the firepot room and jump on
the pot for Halas - that gets you right to the Halas dock. And if you're
a caster you can gate out again and still not have to cross Everfrost...
