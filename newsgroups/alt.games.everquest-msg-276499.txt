EverQuest's 6th Anniversary
--------------------------------------
To help celebrate the 6th Anniversary of EverQuest, a fresh scavenger hunt 
has been added.  Check in Firiona Vie, Overthere, or Dreadlands for more on 
this quest.  Finish this challenging hunt and you will receive a potion that 
doubles your experience for 30 minutes and comes with 10 charges.
Your old friends, the Fabled NPCs have returned to Norrath and bring the 
fabled versions of their items with them.  Look for new Fabled NPCs in your 
favorite Kunark zones.

- Increased the spell rune drop rates for Greater Muramite Runes and Glowing 
Muramite Runes in Muramite Proving Grounds and Riftseeker's Sanctum.

- Volkara in the Volkara's bite mission has been made a little more 
challenging.

made a bit less confusing.
