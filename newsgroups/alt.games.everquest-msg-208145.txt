I started playing EQ about two or three weeks before Stromm opened. I
chose a human warrior in Qeynos. Did most of it without too much problem
by 12... Except one part, that required a giant fire beetle eye. I
counted after a while, and killed over 200 giant fire beetles, both in
WK and in EC (WC? I forget...) Not /ONE/ dropped. I gave up, moved to
Stromm, and took up beastcrafting.
