This was a great post.  As one other poster said, please write more of
these - it is interesting to see how things are the same yet different
on another server.  I'm interspersing some comments below. :)

LOL! Very nice!  The first instinct of many, it seems, is to blame the
healers.  Sometimes they forget that clerics are subject to our OWN
limitations as well.  No matter what race we play, we are all truly
human (at least I hope so :) and as such can only do so much, despite
semi-miraculous powers in-game.

I'm very lucky - a friend of mine drew a portrait of Nickanj for me
when Nick was in his 30's.  He did an updated one of Nick in his
present armor, but I have a soft spot for the original picture - it
makes Nick look like a comic book hero. :)  To see it, click here:

(Yes, Nick's last name used to be Deathwish....he was married in-game,
and that was Ashkevron's last name  Ash is a thing of the past...he's
the bard that had to take up the necro life to save his hands.)



As far as Hand of Virtue goes, it sells for 100k on the Nameless.  I,
however, had a ridiculous run of luck one night, dinged 64, rolled a
91 on a Glyphed that dropped in Tactics of all places (very rare to
see one there), and when I did the turn-in on this, my first Glyphed,
I got Hand of Virtue for the turn-in.  Thought I was going to have a
heart attack. *lol*

The truly funny thing is that I will probably not be using this spell
very much even when I DO hit 65 (which should happen any day now),
because we don't use it for raids.  We get more hitpoints from the
combination of Pot9 and Kazad, and we make up the AC on the tanks with
Ward of Gallantry.  I'll only be casting HoV on my groups, and only if
they aren't still raid-buffed.  Still, I was very lucky and am quite
happy to have that spell taken care of.
