Its a level 54 spell, costs 600 mana, summons a 100 point
pet that immediately attacks cleric target (no target, no pet)
quad hits for 50 a pop, with bash/kick stun...

If the cleric is attacked while the pet is up, it will defend him,
like a chanter pet, but is similarly deaf... and is suicidal.  If
it runs out of targets and can get close to the cleric, it will
cast a spell that kills itself.

Apparantly they were originally buffable, but people were
casting Death Pact on them, which would cause them to
survive whatever spell they cast that kills them.  So with
typical Verant overkill, they made them unbuffable.  Reading
between the lines of the emergency patch, I'm guessing that
they are now immune to death pact.
