OK, show of hands...how many here that have tried bards have given them
names based on musical terms?

(raises hand for my 10 bard, Guitari)

I sometimes wonder why, for most other classes, if you base your name on
what the class does, you are looked down upon, but for bards, almost
everyone does it, with not even a hint of scorn being heaped upon them.
