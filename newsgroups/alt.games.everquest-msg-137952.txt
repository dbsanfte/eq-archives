So on the train back from work I had it stuck in my mind. To get my rogue
that robe from shar vahl, you know the one that looks like the nexus scion
robe and is all/all. So after a late dinner and some running...

[Thu Aug 01 23:22:36 2002] Shainai regards you indifferently -- You could
probably win this fight.

death.'
