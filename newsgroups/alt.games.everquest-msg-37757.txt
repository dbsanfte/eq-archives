For what its worth I cant see this affecting me much in day to day
play, although I guess its always been nice to be able to see if
there are enough people on for it to be worth logging in as I'm not
in a US time zone. That actually will be quite a pain.

I guess taking it to its logical conclusion if they disable "COUNT"
as well it removes some more ability for player performed analysis
of the servers demographics, which have historically proven more
fruitful than anything released by VI and have on occasion resulted
in changes.

I'm kinda hoping that they've learnt their lesson from Sullons opening
and are actually *looking* at figures on server population, etc, now
as is implied by Fippys religion break down. Of course, given that
Fippy is meant to be a "regular" section like the every fortnight
"Arch mage answers" that had two issues then died last year I may be
overly optimistic as to VI's proactive review and consideration of
world statistical data ;(

I think the biggest thing this'll do is stop the "hop on the moment
the patch is finished" rush...
