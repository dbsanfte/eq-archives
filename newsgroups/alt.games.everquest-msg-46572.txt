I have a few honest questions for you.


1) If you saw a man walking down the street coughing, would you assume he
may have a cold or the flu?  Would you cross the road to avoid him?  Will
you cross the road to avoid every person who seems sick in the next few
years?  The reason I ask is. Smallpox initially will seem like the flu.
This hypothetical man may have just gotten off a plane in Los Angeles where
he was infected with smallpox.  He may have then traveled to wherever you
live (lets call it  Smalltown, USA) at that point he is not a vector and has
likely contaminated parts of Smalltown USA.  A town where NOBODY would
suspect a terrorist attack could occur, but it just did, because this
traveling man just brought the attack with him.

Are you following my logic here?  Biological threats can become so far flung
and widespread that unless you plan on living in a concrete bunker and
eating canned foods the next 10 years, you are truly not safe anywhere.

Do you want to live with such fear in your heart like this? You claim you
have children, do you know how mentally anguished your children are going to
be if you preach this to them? They will not have normal, well-adjusted
childhoods, I can say that with great certainty.


2) Chemical attack.  You know that the army gives a 9 second window to get a
gasmask on after a chemical attack?  That means from the minute the agent is
dispersed you have 9 seconds to respond, and this is assuming you are
already wearing an NBC suit.   See the thing about a gasmask and NBC suit is
this:

If you DO need it, i.e. you are at the center of an attack area, you likely
will not be able to get it on in time. If you are outside the attack radius,
then owning one is thoroughly useless because you will not be affected.  It
is a lose lose situation.   You need it but won't be able to use it fast
enough (unless you truly are a wacko that wears NBC gear around town now) or
you are outside the effective radius of the attack.

3) I noticed in another thread you had said you "left".  Does this mean you
moved from the US to a different country?  From a large city like Atlanta to
a small town?  I'm just highly curious as to what you meant by that.  What
precautions, geographically, have you taken against this?  I assume you
packed your entire family up, sold your house, and left for a safer area of
some sort?  Explain.
