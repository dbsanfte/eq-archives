Well, when God handed down the Mosaic law (e.g. the law through Moses)
he didn't specify why.  He just said not to eat fish without scales
(seafood), stuff with a cloven hoof, pork, and all that kind of fun
stuff.  The law just says "nu uh - no BLT for you".  Now, I'm sure
it's just coincidence, but the ancient Egyptians also didn't eat pork,
and abhorred the beasties sufficiently so that they are one of the few
animals known to the Egyptians that didn't get a constellation.
Oddly, the egyptians raised them as pets and used pig parts as part of
their medicine.

As for the new testament, I think it's Acts 15:24-29 that's usually
batted about as a claim that Peter was given a vision that he could
eat anything that had previously been held to be unclean.  As the
Church Lady from Saturday Night Live would have said "How con
VENient!"

Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any shall note itï¿½. Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle.
