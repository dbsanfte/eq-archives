Everyday I'm amazed at the amount of misinformation people come up
with.

No, it doesn't make any difference.  You could be naked, ding and when
you put all your +stat items on you would be at the exact same stats
as if you had dinged with all of the items on you.

This is true regardless.
Twinks generally level faster and that level difference DOES make a
difference...a HUGE difference.
