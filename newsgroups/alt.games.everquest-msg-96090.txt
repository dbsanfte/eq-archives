This account has a level 40 warrior with a full set of items. The armor
consists of a mix of Crafted, Crustation, a SSB, Seb Scale Vambraces, Silken
Cat-fur girdle and more. Weapons are Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies (Procs a
DD) and a Light Velium Warsword (fast). Over 2k in plat, every back pack
filled with goodies. Also Includes J-Boots! Much much more, too much to
list.

Other characters include a 10 Enchanter, 10 Druid, 5 Monk, 4 Wizard, and a 6
Warrior that was my mule. He has TONS of items on him including another full
set of crafted armor and lots more weaps and such. All characters (except
for one or two not mentioned. Not sure what server, I think a PvP one, but
they are only like 7ish in level)

Very nice account, but DAoC has won me over... E-mail me at
blue.dragon@attbi.com if you have any questions!
