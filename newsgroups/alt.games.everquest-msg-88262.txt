Well, if you call "a certain level" 60.  It doesn't work in *all* XP
camps, of course, not even at lower levels.  But a group can go
to 60 getting XP in most common zones (and quite a few of the
ones that are BYOG) without a cleric as long as the shaman
knows his class.   And a shaman with a regular group where he's
primary healer is going to know how to play that role very well.
