Now is NOT the time to direct any anger or hatred towards one country or
continent in which only ONE person is from.  Remember, America is made up of
those from other countries, different countries with different beliefs and
behaviorisms.  Each American different, as is the intent of America's fore
fathers.

Please do not hate an entire race or origin from which one asshole is
derived.  It is =this= type of attitude that the terrorists thrive on, in
hopes to break the moral and spirit, the true spirit of America.

Dont give them that satisfaction.  It is clear, that aside from those lives
that the terrorists have taken, may god bless their souls, they have only
awoken the sleeping giant once again.

Show your pride and let it be known.  Fly our colors, donate blood and keep
a cool collective head about you.  Its natural for any caring person to be
disgusted/pissed at what "they" have done to us all, just be sure to focus
that disgust/hatred in the right direction.
