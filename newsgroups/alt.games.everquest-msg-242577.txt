right, because there is no such thing as a bot outside pok, and no

Unless they specifically say they're not extended, a question about
whether they are extended is fully valid.

Yes and?

Actually, your post sounds exactly like that.

Great, so is every other member of the group. Get off your proverbial
horse.

Some enchanter that just joined the group needs a lesson in
interpersonal communication, and needs to stop assuming he's the only
one that knows how to play this game.

And with you're attitude you are surprised?

You apparently have never heard of lag that causes mobs to look
unmezzed and makes them appear to keep walking. Unless you tell me you
mezzed the mob, I won't know for sure.

What's your job? Beating on the cleric?

That makes a lot of sense...

You know, they have a name for that complex.

You know, I pray for that overpull that will inevitable happen. And I
will stand on the sidelines and watch and enjoy. Nevermind I'd never
group with you anyway.

Yep. To everybody else too. Guess what? People make mistakes! Who
would have thought?

Have you ever accidentally klicked on the wrong spot because of lag?
And with the great new impossible-to-target-with-mouse system, a
simple missed click on a hot button can cause this... apparently you
think if anybody other than you makes a mistake, they don't know how
to play.

I haven't played a high level cleric, but from what I hear, this would
only be the case early in the fight. If the majority of mobs are
mezzed and it's between the MT and the enchanter dying, the cleric
should make the call which is more important to keep alive. That I bet
is very situationally dependent.

Well you must be in shitty groups. No wonder with your attitude.

The problem here is that many enchanters suck at this and I've gotten
killed because of it. Just because you're good at playing your
character, does not mean everybody in the group suddenly knows and
trusts that. If the group decides charming is too risky, don't charm
or go solo.

Bah, BS. I know that at least wiz and mag always have to compromise on
spells to keep up. You're not the only one limited by the 8 memorized
spell limit.

Well then take some of your own medicine and stop pretending you know
what spells everybody else needs to have loaded.

Yeah, and again it shows your unneccessary aggression.

See above; sometimes it's quite helpful to know which mob you mezz,
because it's not always as implicitly obvious when you're not the
enchanter.

That statement is plain wrong. It's bullshit and you know it. Sure
there are no differences between pulling a god and pulling a lvl 1
bat. You got it.

You make the whole experience more of a military training excercise.
I'm playing this game to have fun. I will guarantee you, I would never
group with your kind.

You are also the kind of person I stay away from in real life. God you
must be a pain in the ass to deal with.
