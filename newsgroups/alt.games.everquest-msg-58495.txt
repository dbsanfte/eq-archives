Which 3 clerical hp buffs stack?

Resolution, Heroic Bond and Heroism are the 3 non-reagent HP buffs, they do
not stack with each other.

Symbols are the other.

Maybe you didn't see the 'hp' part of "as far as hp buffs are concerned,
there's only two series from a cleric that stack!"

Correct us if were wrong, but whats the third HP buff?

Heroic = AC and HP buff
Symbol = HP buff
AoF/SoWords/BoF = AC buff.

Buffs that will stack with them are krag (shamans line of hp buffs) and
Divine glory (palis 'stack with anythin' hp buff) but these aren't cleric
buffs.
