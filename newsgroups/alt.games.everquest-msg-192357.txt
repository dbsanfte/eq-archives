If, and only if, the person in question was high level enough to be able to
go help kill Rallos Zek and actually acquire the blade, then I have no
problem with it. Whether they're in a guild or not doesn't matter.

Now, if they weren't high enough lvl to go kill Rallos Zek (and ESPECIALLY
if they weren't even high enough lvl to actually go to ANY planes), then I
would have a MAJOR problem with it.....
