God, that plat sounds so lonely and unfulfilled.

I know! You should let it be free and upgrade a poor 56 Drinalian Cleric 
that has no idea how he'll afford a Mana Preservation IV item when his 
MPIII item gives up the ghost.

Now that I have a pet class alt(BST), I think I may have found a good way 
to farm. When I get a bit older(Read: get my new pet in 2 levels- I'm 28 
and poor Fluffy has been around since I think 20) I think I will hit an 
animal/spider heavy zone and clean up. The beauty here is that you can have 
the pet always killing something while you run around and mop up corpses. 
Tailoring crap sells like mad(especially on drinal, I have noticed a 
MASSIVE hike in pelts etc in the last few weeks)

I haven't tried it yet but I think greyhoppers in MS will be my first 
attempt.
