I currently have a VooDoo 3 (3500 series) 16MB AGP video card in my system.
How well would it work (Win98SE) with Luclin?  I've got the expansion
pre-ordered from www.ebworld.com (had it ordered since early September).
Should I keep it and upgrade in a month or so or will it become incompatible
and need me to upgrade to something else?
    What about the ATI All-n-Wonder Radion (AGP)?  I'd want the 32MB version
at least, and I do some recording (video capture) as well as TV in ability
so I would like to get the ATI Radion card.  Does anybody else use it with
EQ?  I have the ATI All-n-Wonder Pro 8MB AGP card that I got 2 years ago
which is in a much slower system (128MB RAM, 450MHz AMD K6-2) and I remember
it had a problem with 2D graphics.  The images used for tree branches or the
false walls/floors would show up as flashing/flickering grayscale and would
appear as the closest layer of image, causing me to see them through
anything.  If an area (the sewers under Qeynos) had a trap door in the floor
or wall, I could see it through the other walls, see them from another room
(that part I didn't mind as much).  However, the rugs/flooring of huts/shops
I would see from anywhere inside, or for a certain distance outside.  Does
the Radion still have this problem (and also did they correct it with the
older card too)?  I imagine its just some kind of driver problem but I only
used that system for EQ for the next 6 months, now its a secondary system
that I use as a primary when on EQ.
    Keep the VooDoo 3 (is it compatible now with Luclin) and upgrade soon?
    Or do I have to buy the ATI Radion now (VooDoo 3 not being compatible
any more)?
