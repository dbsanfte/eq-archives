And the fact that, in some way, a doctor may be promoting his current
beliefs in a certain behavior.  Much like Computer Addiction Specialists.
In some cases, doctors do subscribe to a certain belief, and often times
called on by litigators to 'support' their case, and often times it works,
because they are considered 'expert' witnesses.  They don't exactly have to
be paid by the litigator to say things, it goes towards supporting a theory
they are writing a paper or book on that will work for them in the future
as well.
