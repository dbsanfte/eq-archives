i agree!
i WANT chat with the others in the group ... and the others around me!

i love making new emotes and really making people laugh!
/em cheeks really flap as he lets a rip-roarer!
or
(works with gnomes especially well)
/em sneezes explosively and goes flying head-over-heels backwards!
hehehehe

guildchat is good when you are in a guild that actually communicates...
and is willing to listen to you!

and i really do love helping newbies... and it is easy to pick out those
who aren't newbies... wearing armor better than I have on (17th ranger)...
DEMANDING help!  throwing around plat like it was water...
and newbies that are trying to roleplay... it helps the community
when more of those are in the game.  not just ppl talking about
numbers of stats and weapons and not going OOC when talking about
their other characters and the like... aargh!

oh well...
