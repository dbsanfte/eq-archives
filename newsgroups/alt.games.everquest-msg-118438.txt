I was camping the tainted brownie in Lfay earlier today, about an hour into
the camp another druid shows up, he helps me with the camp so that he can
get it after me.  One slight problem, we both *really* underestimated the
power of brownie.

After about 3 hours at the camp, tainted spawns, yay, we get him killed,
corrupted is just standing there while we med a bit, I suggest we get some
help, but he says we don't need it, ...
We engage the Corrupted Brownie.

[Tue May 28 20:20:18 2002] You say, 'Hail, corrupted brownie'
[Tue May 28 20:20:19 2002] corrupted brownie scowls at you, ready to
attack -- he appears to be quite formidable.
[Tue May 28 20:20:34 2002] You begin casting Ensnare.
[Tue May 28 20:20:38 2002] You feel the pain of a thousand stings.
[Tue May 28 20:20:39 2002] You say, 'Hail, tainted brownie'

First "Oh Shit" - 2 tainteds popped in a row, second as we engage first
corrupted right on top of us.

[Tue May 28 20:20:46 2002] Malstorm tells the group, 'nuking'
[Tue May 28 20:20:50 2002] corrupted brownie says 'You will not evade me
Malstorm!'

Second "Oh Shit" - He summons.

At this point I have little to no mana left, and we've got a 60 monk and 60
rogue that were in zone helping.

[Tue May 28 20:37:41 2002] You resist the Ice spell!

Third "Oh Shit" - He agro's us while we're preparing spells and getting mana
back.

[Tue May 28 20:38:47 2002] Insidius was pierced by thorns.
[Tue May 28 20:38:47 2002] Insidius was pierced by thorns.
[Tue May 28 20:38:48 2002] Insidius was pierced by thorns.
[Tue May 28 20:38:49 2002] Insidius was pierced by thorns.
[Tue May 28 20:38:50 2002] Insidius was pierced by thorns.
[Tue May 28 20:38:52 2002] Insidius was pierced by thorns.
[Tue May 28 20:38:53 2002] Insidius was pierced by thorns.
[Tue May 28 20:38:53 2002] Insidius was pierced by thorns.

Fourth "Oh Shit" - He's got a fairly hefty damage shield, which is NOT good
when your melee help both are light but fast hitters.

Total Score - Corrupted Brownie: 5 (me once, rogue once, monk once, other
druid twice); Us: 0 (the corrupted despawned)

And as if that wasn't bad enough, while I was bringing corpses to the
Steamfont zone line.

[Tue May 28 20:52:53 2002] Equestrielle the Corrupted begins to cast a
spell.
[Tue May 28 20:52:56 2002] Your blood simmers.
[Tue May 28 20:52:57 2002] Equestrielle the Corrupted hits YOU for 112
points of damage.

Yeah, that's right, the bitch horse shows up to give me the boot from the
zone.  At least she had used her HT up on someone else already.  (probably
the guy who was /shouting "someone kill that horse")

Fucking Whee.  I'm a dumbass for letting the other druid talk me into
engaging corrupted without backup or full mana.  I hate brownies.
