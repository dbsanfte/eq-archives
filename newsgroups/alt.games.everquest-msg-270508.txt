The problem here is this:  None of the links or messages on the EQ2 
launchapd are specifically written 'for' the EQ2 launchpad.  They are links 
to appropriate articles and/or text copies of messages on the EQ2 website. 
The original message was posted in the forums, specifically , and a copy of 
that article was placed on the launchpad.

Specifically, everything that shows up under the Update Notes section of the 
launchpad is a text copy of articles in the Update Notes forum.  So when SOE 
said they would provide updates "here", they meant the Update Notes forum, 
not the launchpad.

Dark Tyger is correct, you are assuming that this note in question was 
specifically written for the launchpad.  It was not.  None of the items that 
show in the launchpad truly are.
