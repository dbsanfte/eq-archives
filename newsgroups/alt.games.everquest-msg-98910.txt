Thanks for all the tips. I'm going to try bypassing my router (a
Linksys) and going straight from the modem to my computer. If that
clears the problem, well then I guess I'll have to look into a new
router. I was originally going to get an SMC but the CompUSA near me
was out so I went with the Linksys. If that solves the problem, I'll
be gratefull. The prospect of having to deal with Comcast and it's
team of techs doesn't exactly thrill me. Thanks again. -Raydeen
