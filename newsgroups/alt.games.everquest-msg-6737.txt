I have read several reply post I cant say about the exp in Overthere I have
yet to hunt there. Here are the things I personally look at when moving to a
new hunting Grounds. 1>Binding points how far will I have to run in the
event of death ( Not so much a problem at 30 and beyond with a Cleric in the
group). 2> Merchants and a Bank how far and safe is it to sell loot to keep
from being encumbered. 3> Levels of mobs and availability, I prefer mobs
blue and a few blacks (cuts down time medding and healing for next fight
over time more exp). For a good Race I would suggest Splitpaw, but you being
a Troll I think Overthere just might be the ticket.
