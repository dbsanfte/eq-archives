I see what you are saying.  If I was the MT in your group, I would
reimburse you for a symbol if it cost you that much.  I'm surprised
most don't do this.
As far as bards needing expensive conponents, I do not think that is
the case at any level.  I do know that post 50 a lot of groups expect
you to have instruments that are better than the Mistmoore Battle
Drums (or their equivalents).  Some of these groups won't even take
you unless you have better instruments because of the song bonuses,
regardless if you are a great bard or not.

At high levels, is it possible to solo undead mobs with your undead DD
spells or is that not mana efficient?
