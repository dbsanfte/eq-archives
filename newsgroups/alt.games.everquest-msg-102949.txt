I don't think this is a serious issue, and I don't think Verant will
move to quickly to nerf it....It is no more "unbalancing" than the
Warriors Defensive Discipline. 

Sure it's an amazing amount of damage, but how many 60 Wizards are
running around with that many AAxp points? With a 2.5 hour recharge it
won't be used that often.
