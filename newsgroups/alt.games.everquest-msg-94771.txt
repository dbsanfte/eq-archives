The swift reaction, as far as I can tell, has *only* been after it's been
noticed and complained about by players.

Did I ever tell you about the warrior I grouped with wielding a sword that
procced complete heal?  Was a great night.  Level 60 warrior, no cleric in
the group, and we destroyed Sebilis.  I had never seen him before that
night, and have never seen him again since.  I just assumed it was a GM
having some fun.
