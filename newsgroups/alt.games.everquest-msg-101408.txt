And this is where we get into risk analysis; not just now, but for the
future. Let us assume that the soviets could, did, or believed they ocould
run those reactors competently and so built them.

Then, with the collapse of the union a far smaller base of technical
expertise, funding for maintenance, training, expensive technical tools,
etc, were available to the people who inherited the reactors, which now
could threaten a sizable portion of europe with wind carried radiation,
etc,etc.

If these plants had been coal based , would the risk of being inherited
by an impoverished deskilled nation be as serious?

And if the answer is "no", and there is a case for the argument that
"It is harder to safely maintain a nuclear reactor and requires a greater
level of resource, because the associated risk is so serious, and the
safety proceedures have to be so stringent, no laxness can be tolerated".
there would also seem to be a case for the argument that "the future is
not certain and while we are reasonably sure we can operate this plant
safely NOW we cannot be so certain we will be able to look after it,
and its waste, for the period of time required in the future, and therefore
have an unquantifiable risk that it would be foolish to accept."

If nuclear waste lasts as long as my laymans opnion would imply, it would
seem hard to argue that we will be able to consistently keep it sealed
up, safely under wraps until it has decayed to safe levels.

Anyway ;) I think we both understand each other, and possibly fall on
differing sides of the "my uninformed opinion speculates that nuclear
waste/plants are more risky and longlasting than fossil fuel waste/plants"
position ;)

Wish someone ehre had stepped up to claim authority ;)

(and no , you cant just claim it, I have to believe it too ;) )
