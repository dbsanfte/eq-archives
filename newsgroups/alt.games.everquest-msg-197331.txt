I sent this in a very slightly different form to SoE (not that I think
it'll d any good, except in allowing me to vent)  and I've posted that
same format on one of my old guild's boards in response to the idea
that this is a good thing:


I'll be honest here - I'm livid about this. 

I heard about this last night (Saturday) during my experience group in
Tactics. I have KILLED myself to get into these zones, and one of the
nicest things about some of them is the fact that the flags limit the
number of incompetent players to a certain degree. What this will do
will be to create any number of "Karnor's Castle" zones - train
central full of @$$holes trash-talking in /ooc and /shout, camp
stealing, KS'ing, and generally ruining what have been fantastic zones
that only competent players have been able to access.

If they even wanted to open just PoV and PoS (which would, in effect,
open BoT), I wouldn't be upset, I don't think, because those zones are
frankly necessary for advancement after level 62, and I consider the
trials required to get into them as being outside the normal rules of
fair play, as some classes are not high in DPS and have mediocre fast
healing ability.  It is POSSIBLE to get 65 in PoN/PoI, but I wouldn't
want to do it, and I can understand having some mercy on people. But
Tactics and HoH? There are too many people for these zones as it is -
they are becoming overcrowded quickly, and as soon as people realize
that Tactics is pretty much the best experience in the game outside of
elemental planes, they'll be there in spades. Trouble is, this zone is
extremely dangerous in all it's classic dungeon-ness, and these people
will probably manage to get any number of people killed before dying
themselves. I cannot think of a 'reward" that would be worth this.

I'm done ranting now..sorry about this. I just hate it when I and
others put in a lot of effort on something, only to have that effort
nullified later.

PS:  One last caveat - at no point am I trying to imply that anyone
who has ever failed the PoV/PoS trials is incompetent.  I would be
including most of the population of EQ if I did - including myself. :)
