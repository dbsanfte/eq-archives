Windows 2000 would have purposefully have assigned these devices to IRQ 9. It's
normal to see PCI devices sharing the same IRQ. Windows wont let you re-assign
these devices unless you disable ACPI support in your systems BIOS. Im
defianately not suggesting you go poking around in your BIOS though, proceed at
your own risk.
