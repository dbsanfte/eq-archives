My wife's the same way.  She still (at 60) keeps every bit of loot, no
matter how cheap.  I joke that she still has the first fire beetle eye she
ever looted.

One time we had been in a dungeon for a really long time, several hours,
killing and looting and stuff.  She starts to complain that she's
encumbered.  I look on her screen, and she has over 2000 silver and 2000
copper on her.  (She's a shaman, and had been buffing her STR, but even that
was becoming inadequate.) "Delete the silver and copper" I tell her.  

She looked at me like I had told her to put the baby into the blender.  I
offered to trade her 25pp for it, which she didn't do, because she knew I'd
just destroy the money.  Finally she destroyed some of the copper.

The funny part is that she now has over 100K plat in the bank.  Not from
being thrifty with loot, but from selling PotC earring stuff, yet she still
hangs onto every bit of loot she can get.
