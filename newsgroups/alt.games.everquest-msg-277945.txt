Offically, they may still be against it. For all intents and purposes, 
however, they have effectively renounced their longtime stance that it is 
harmful to the integrity of the game, and will likely continue to do little 
about it. As such I'm certain a great many players will follow suit out of 
greed, convenience or both, dealing with IGE and their ilk where they may 
not have felt comfortable doing so in the past.
