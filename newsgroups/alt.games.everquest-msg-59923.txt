That's what I said.  Text of the patch message was:

We have changed the way the /consider command works and expanded the level
range at which players are able to gain experience. We have added a 'light
blue' area between green and blue. NPCs that used to /consider green but
gave experience will now /consider light blue, as well as NPCs of slightly
lower level than those greens. You will always get experience for something
that is light blue. You will not receive experience for greens. At the same
time, by including lower level NPCs in the light blue /consider, we have
increased the range of lower level NPCs that will grant experience. This
will be most noticeable for characters of higher level.


I was saying I've seen no evidence of any "increased range of lower level
NPCS that will grant experience."
