That happened to me yesterday on Konnichiha.
Had ye old basic "kill 10 Vahz in Steel Canyon" mission, and attacked a
bunch that were at the spawn by one of the contacts.
Sniped the mort, plus follow up attacks then he ran.
When he came back he had 20% health left, I sniped him and he died, and
I got credited for the kill,  about 30 seconds later while I was
fighting something else, boom he's back up and shooting and killed me
(since that dart poison slow means you can't move at all while
hovering).

Sure was a nasty surprise.

I don't think I like the thought that potentially any monster might get
back up again.

On another note I finally hit 14th on Konnichiha yesterday and got Fly.

Now I see what people mean about the game becoming new again when you
don't have to slog across maps.

Damn the city looks even more impressive from up high.
