Hi,

best thing i have found to raise skill is to sit near to the whisperling in
the pit around SharVal. It is affected by songs, doesnt agro and even if a
bug or any other mob wanders by they wont hit that hard that you would be
stunned and the song would end. So you can leave your bard there playing a
few hours and you ll be surprised how much your skill has shot up =)

Have fun in game

Christian
