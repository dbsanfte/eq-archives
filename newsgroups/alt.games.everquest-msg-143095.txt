I am familiar with three vendors who's prices are variable
independently of race/faction/cha.  What I have noticed, and to
a limited degree tested, is that their behavior changes based
on whether you are primarily selling or buying.  For each of these,
if I trade with them immediately after a server reset (patch, etc.)
their prices are always at their nominal value.  If they are then
used primarily for selling, they will eventually begin to pay less
and charge more.  If I then make in a series of purchases from the
now "greedier" vendor, I can bring their prices back to nominal.
The effect of transactions on the "greed level" of these vendors
seems to be somewhat proportional to the value of the transaction
(i.e. buying a water flask for 1s3c doesn't help, while buying an
armor mold or gem for several pp will get them to back off a little
bit on their greed).  I assume there are other vendors who act like
this, but I've only noted the behavior with three:  the banded armor
mold vendor in kelethin (orc lift platform), one of the three in
the shop in Felwithe that the bard is outside of (not the fletching
guy, or the one behind the counter), and the gnome gem seller in
Rathe Mtns.

Hmmm.  I guess the point of all that rambling is that, for the
variable greed merchants, the game acts as if they start "feeling"
strapped for cash when they've been paying out a lot more than
they've been taking in, so they start paying less and charging more.
