   Well Being my 3rd Char (ever) was a Troll War played him to level
27 befor Annie had me move to a new server ended up with a Oger War
till level 46 and rerolled to Shadow Knight (AKA Lenny V 2.0) now
level 46 allso much more fun. he has a Intell of 98 to 107 due to
weapon and sheld stats. anof mana that medding is a pain to do because
med is 135 till level 50. 

good stuff: 
STR and STa on both troll and ogre 

no stun (Ogre)

Reg (Troll)

Bad stuff:

EXP loss  (both)

the reg is a waste after aroung level 15 on troll and 20 for the
lizards do to recoveing of mass hit points still seem to take more and
more time allso by that time most SK are grouping with healers and can
steal Hit points from others. so reg cost more exp then advantage
gained

last the bigest pain is the size of both can get you or you party
killed becase getting stuck in doors or passages need to hang out with
someone that can make you small. other wise be carefull were you go.

not sure if all I said makes cents
                         Lenny
