A) Well then as others have pointed out don't top post and re-propogate
his junk.

B) The problem with killfiles is they rename themselves every week so
although you kill filed them last week so you still see them again,
however the german news.individual.net server which is 10euro a year
does a pretty damned good job of filtering them all out, which it did in
this case till you and a few others reposted it all again.
