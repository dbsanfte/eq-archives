lol, nice if you can swing the 20K....it stretches the budget to get a 
5k car=\ and that was with 2 incomes. And besides, it only is available 
in an automatic. I will never own an automatic again, I am a confirmed 
driver. I can do more precise driving in all weather conditions in a 
manual, and it is infinitely easier to repair for a heck of a lot less 
money if something does go out. I have a spare subaru loyale sitting in 
my field that they want 1200$US for to replace the tranny, as well as a 
caravan that they want 1300$us to do the tranny on. I have an antique VW 
that only has needed a clutchplate replaced, and a cable...total cost 
IIRC was 200$ total, and that included changing the oil and oil filter. 
Not bad for a 71 beetle[not a superbeetle] with less than 100k miles on 
it.[of course the seats need recovering, and the head liner is still 
sort of stained and probably could use replacing because of that, and 
there are a couple spots of sanded and primered area that we have got to 
fiish painting, and some asshat stole the vw medallion off the boot 
lid....and it doesnt have a radio...]
