makes me think of one of my favorite Monty Pythons skits....
I can see some of the oldtimers now....

"We used to live in a one room flat all 23 of us... half the floor was
missing and we had to take turns to sleep because there wasnt enought
room"
" oh your lucky... we used to live in a shoe box... and got our water
from damp newspapers"
"damp news papers?... you were lucky... we used to live in a Lake, and
every morning we woudl have to get up and clean the lake, and eat hot
gravel for breakfast"
"Hot gravel for breakfast? You were lucky... We had to Get up at 3 AM,
2 hours before we went to bed and had to eat cold rat poison every
morning"
" clean the lake? you were lucky... we had to get up and clean the
road with our toungs...."
HERE IS THE CATCHER
"and you try to tell the kids today,...... and they wouldnt believe
ya"


Mind you this is just an image that flashed through my mind after
seeing Dan, and Jazz and the rest letting off some steam about the
newbies geting it so easy... 
Personaly... glad the book is gone... glad levels 1-10 are a little
less tedious....  but I am concerned what verant has in mind for the
future...   I dont want a micky mouse game....
