However, that doesn't mean it has to be at the same time every time.  Right
now, they do the patches to avoid overall peak times, which means that for
some customers, the patches are almost never at an inconvenient time, and
for others, they almost always are at an inconvenient time.

The idea here is to impact the smallest number of customers, even if it
means that a few get hit a lot.  Another approach would be to make it so
that every customer is impacted equally.

They could do that by patching at 3AM one time, then 11AM next time, then
7PM next time.  Every customer then sees about the same thing: 1/3 of the
patches nails their prime time, 1/3 might hit it if it is a long patch, and
1/3 doesn't bother them at all.

Or, they could try some kind of weighted thing.  Say 50% of the players on
on US times, 25% Euro, and 25% Asian.  Do 40% of the patches during Euro
prime time, 40% during Asian prime time, and 20% during US prime time.  This
would still give some favor to the US player, but it would not nail the
Euros and Asians every time.
