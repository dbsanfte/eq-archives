How about this stroke of genius?  I leveled up my first ever character
to level 5.  Back then, I thought that was such a huge effort (little
did I know).  I then accidentally attacked a merchant and was promptly
killed.  I was so mad, thinking the whole town would hate me for that
and the rest of my character's life would be screwed up as a result. 
So I deleted the char and started over.  Doh!
