The EQPlayers site, http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/network_status.vm, 
says:

All EverQuest English language servers will be coming down at 5:00 AM 
PST on Thursday 10/05/2006 for a game update. Estimated downtime is 4 hours.

Its currently 3:34 EST, which is the equivalent, if I have this right, 
of 12:34 PST.  5 PST plus 4 hours is 9 PST... so the patch is now 3 and 
a half hours overdue from their estimate.

For once, the status page does show all servers as down, so I don't have 
to wonder if its just login server congestion keeping me out, or whether 
(as so frequently happens) they are listing the servers as up but in 
fact they are not accessable because the login server isn't up; just a 
few devs wandering around inside pretending to test the changes.

Can't find any text for the current patch (I miss the days when AGE 
people seemed to compete to be the first to post the text, and then we'd 
all pick it apart and try to figure out what was going on) either. 
Guess I'll go read Order of the Stick or (shudder) try to get some 
actual RL work done.
