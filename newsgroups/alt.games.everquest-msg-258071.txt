Here is the other side of the coin:
A merging lane implies that both parties have the responsibility to
cooperate.  It is not one lane merging into the other, it is two lanes
merging into one.  This is the law.  If I come to the end of a merging lane
and theres a long line of people on the freeway already, all driving too
close to the guy in front of them and none of them are willing to open a
space for me to get in, it creates a dangerous choice for me.  Do I try to
force my way in, or do I come to a full stop on the freeway?  If you refuse
to allow people to merge you are at fault.
