True. (speaking as someone with a wood elf warrior and a dark elf
shadow knight. I even sacrificed 5 wis to let my druid have 75 base
strength, and I figure I'll be making another run to Erudin soon to
look for Erudite sewing kits)
However, it's pretty hard to mess up your stats to the point where a
character becomes unplayable. Low str will get you encumbered, agi
below 75 makes for a hard life for a tank, low wis/int can create mana
issue for casters... but regretting the allocation of 5 points is no
reason to consider restarting a character.
