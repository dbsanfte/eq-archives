[Disclaimer: I like Linux & use it a lot, so this is not an anti-Linux
 rant]

The fundamental problem is lack of demand.  It's a noble goal to see
Linux as a gaming platform to rival Windows, but sadly not likely to
happen soon.  Not that Linux is totally lacking: quite a few large
commercial games have surfaced there (Quake 1/2/3, Civ:CTP...), and
there are plenty of lesser-known games with a high fun factor (Nethack!)

However, people who want to play games on Linux generally have a PC
which dual-boots Windows.  From a software company's point of view, why
put the time & expense in to make a Linux port, when you already *know*
that the vast majority of your potential Linux market already has
Windows, and is just as likely to buy a Windows version of the game?

This is pretty academic these days, given that EQ already runs on
"multiuser" versions of Windows - Win2K & XP.  Not to mention EQW.

Indeed.  I guess Verant estimate the Mac market to be large enough to
justify the porting expense (which will be lower than Linux, given that
MacOSX already has a Direct3D implementation).  Mac users also don't
dual-boot Windows on the same PC.

Very true.  Loki tried, and failed.  They did some great stuff while
they were going, and left behind a useful legacy (SDL among things), so
it wasn't a complete failure.  But it was a demonstration that the
commercial games market on Linux is pretty tiny.
