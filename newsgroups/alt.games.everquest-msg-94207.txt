Well, I have absolutely no clue what you are talking about in this or your 
last 10 or so posts. Quote some context, will you?

Otherwise I (and probably most people) will assume its probably not 
important enough to dig out whichever post you're replying to just to see 
if it has anything to do with them, and will likely just killfile you (I 
often ditch posts after I've read them, I certainly don't have my 
newsreader display them). Even despite that, the way messages propagate 
between newsservers mean people may see your replies before they recieve 
the original messages you're replying to.
