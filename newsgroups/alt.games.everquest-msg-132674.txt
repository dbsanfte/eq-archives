Yep, thats one heck of a spell.. its also great for grouping purposes.
Still, as a dwarven cleric I've had to work -real- hard to solo and
am very aware of how drastically easier even the worst possible snare
would have made things

I still say this is a relatively trivial bonus.  Sure, the first 25 levels
or so a non SOW casting character may have to do without... but those
levels are such a tiny portion of a characters overall life.  And I did
say "well equipped" by which I meant "modestly twinked"

Sufficient FT items to offset mana regen would not be "modest"
they would be "fantastically well equipped for anyone under
level 60," further mana regen will hardly ever save your life, but
SOW (or J/Tboot) will do so with astonishing frequence (especially
if you are a solo artist)

Can't they use mez as a "pet back off" that actually works far more
reliably than voice control?  Course having to take a hit just to
say "pet attack" is a pain, and getting mob on correct target sucks...

More then, you mean?  Everyone benefits equally from the smallness
of Luclin, though, don't they?  Or are you talking about the funny
Succor tricks my little baby druid uses to get from Nexus to
Shar Val in under two minutes?
