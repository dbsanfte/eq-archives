You sound like a kid in a playground. Who the heck was trolling? Nobody.

Some fellow came along when your cute little guild was mentioned (my words,
not his) and said "I'm not sure that The Pantheon is uber anymore." Sounds
like a simple opinion, eh? No foul words, no insults, nothing. Kind of like,
"I don't think Mark McGwire is the hitter he used to be." Then he says some
other guild may now be the "uber guild" of your server, along with three
others fighting for position. Then he says nice stuff about his own guild.
Didn't compare them to your little group of players, didn't criticize them,
didn't insult them in any way, shape, or form. Just offered his own
observations.

Now, your little bit about not being the bragging type was either a load of
rubbish, or it was just .... well, it was a load of rubbish, wasn't it?

Here's an opinion: If dick-waving twits like you are indicative of The
Pantheon, I'm rather glad they do not exist on my server.
