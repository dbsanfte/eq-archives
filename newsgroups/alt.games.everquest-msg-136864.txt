? Clerics are one of the richest characters of all.
They usually get all the gems or something to make up for
their symbol cost, which if they are with nice people in high
end areas more than covers the cost and makes them rich.
Plus they get invited to the best teasure/drop groups also, for
things with high dollar sell value.

I have yet to see a single "poor" level 51 plus cleric.

Group, soloing is pretty much the opposite of being a cleric.
The cleric owns and controls the group, because he is the most
important person there. If people aren't looting fair, make them or
leave.
