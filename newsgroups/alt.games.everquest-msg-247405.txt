Lol! Perhaps you should have someone explain to you just what a Usenet 
troll actually is, Sparky. Then you can at least begin using the term 
correctly.

When in Rome? Well, I'd say the majority of the "Romans", myself being 
one, *don't* use the term, "toon", so we go back to my previous question. 
Which Romans establish what the Romans do? The minority or the majority?

Like I said, it's a minor annoyance to me, nothing more. It doesn't 
affect my opinion of a person to any degree or anything. However, to 
imply that it's the status quo is just incorrect IME.
