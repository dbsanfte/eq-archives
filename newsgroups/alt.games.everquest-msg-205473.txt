Verant was part of Sony prior to EQ. It was a subsidiary of Sony. A
lot at Sony had no faith in EQ because the business models (according
to Sony) said UO had cornered the market and there was only a market
for a single MMOG. The people of Verant where in a sense taking all
the risk for this project. Only after it's great success did Sony want
it's name slapped all over it.

Sony slapping it's name all over EQ I am sure helped it's stock
prices. 

G4TV had a great Icons show about the history of EQ and it's creators.
