I'm sure that I'm asking for Murphy to step-in and lay-down the
Law with me for saying this, but...

No, I haven't had any problems since the patch.  My high-res
works fine, rain doesn't cause any problems, etc.

Actually, I've noticed that the spell effects seem to be more
detailed after the patch, which is a bonus, as it doesn't seem
to run any slower than it did before.
