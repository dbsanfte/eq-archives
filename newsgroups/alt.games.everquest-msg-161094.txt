Now, I take offense to that, as Lance is someone for whom I generally have
respect for.  I asusme you're from the Tom Servo group?  In that case, don't
let his words here give you the wrong impression, he's usually more
well-reasoned.

Problem is, the media has been especially good at painting the same picture
of  Bush that they have for every single blasted republican since before
Ike.  This time, however, Bush was a great canvas for that painting.  After
all, they could point out how his presidential father (who was a relatively
minor figure at the time in question) got him in to Harvard, so they can
play the "poor little rich boy" card.  They can point at his misspeaks and
say he's dyslexic (which pisses me the hell off, I'm dyslexic, but the Dept.
of Energy trusts me to supervise the operation of a nuclear reactor).
Basically, Bush was a prime target for the attacks, and the paint stuck.

Of course, most of it's washed off now that he's shown himself to be a quiet
powerhouse.  It's just a matter of people overcoming their prejudices.
