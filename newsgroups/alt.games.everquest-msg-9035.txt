I have a friend who has 2-way microwave connection, it has great download
speeds,
but it is bad for ping time, expect it to be 100 to 200ms more than a modem
because
of the delays in transmitting and encoding all the data.
Im not sure on satellite but I would expect the ping times would be just as
high because
of the delays it has to go through in the transmitters and sattelite.
