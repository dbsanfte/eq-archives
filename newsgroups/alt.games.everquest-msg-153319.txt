The same could be argued for those who can duel box who "have been 
handed bags of exp". Or those with RL friends with high level characters 
  who can powerlevel them being "handed bags of exp". Or those who don't 
have a job or social life, who have too much time on their hands to 
become uber AA point level 60 characters. EQ is a game, but its affected 
by MANY outside influences which can't be helped. Trying to regulate or 
control it is useless.

Besides, if you feel the lack of a 24/7 internet account is a big 
hindrence to your game playing then get a 24/7 internet account. Problem 
solved.
