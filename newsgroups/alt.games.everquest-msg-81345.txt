What are your system specs?
What network card do you have?
What operating system?

I had the very same thing happen to me.
I have 2 machines connected to a switch then a Linksys router then my
cable modem.

System 1
Dual 1.0ghz PIII's
512meg RAM
Geforce3 ti 200
3COM network card

System 2
AMD 1.1ghz Athalon
1.0gig RAM
Geforce3 ti 200
Generic network card (Realtek chipset)

Both running Win2K with all the latest service packs etc...

One machine would do exactly like you said - lights on my switch would
go crazy and the machine seemed to drop network connectivity.
The system in question was only different from my other system in that
it used a 3COM network card so I changed it to one of those $20
generic cards and have not had the problem since.

Yes I tried the latest drivers from 3COM, reloading the operating
system and manually setting the network card  with no improvement.

Hope that helps
