In general, there are three questions one should ask when one signs up for a
group:
1. What classes do we have here?
2. What is my role? (unless it's bleeding obvious, of course. I play a druid
so it differs depending on healing situations, etc.)
3. How do we loot?

If the people in the group can't reply to these simple questions, you should
find another group. I usually volunteer to ML since I play the druid that
can gate out and sell stuff easily, but that does mean te rest of the group
will have to trust me to do this fairly. In general it's a tricky thing this
loot stuff and often can cause lotsa quarrels, but is something that should
be fairly easy to sort out. If it's not working and you really need the
money, hget out of the group and find another...
