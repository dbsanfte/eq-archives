    I would have thought that The Sims Online would have taken if not the
first spot, then at least the second.  There are a heck of a lot of The
Simss players out there that could have been introduced to the fun and
excitement of online gaming, if they had actually been delivered a game to
play.

   I was pretty freaking disapointed.
