I bought it when it cost ï¿½300, and I have to say that I didn't notice 
much of a difference at all in EQ over my previous GeForce3... I guess 
I'm probably CPU-limited. On the other hand, it runs Doom 3 very nicely 
indeed, so it's certainly not a bad card; perhaps just not the best 
choice for EQ.
