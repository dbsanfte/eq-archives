Let me take a shot at it.  He's saying that two points of view exist on the
matter.  He is saying that both points of view have their merits.  He is NOT
saying that he believes either one to be more "right" than the other,
although he does point out that there are some aspects of the game --
including spell lists, trainer locations, etc. -- that support the
possibility that "The Vision" follows the one of these two philosophies that
you, Dark Tyger, do not.

Don't take my stab at this to mean I give a rat's ass either way on the
subject matter, because I don't.  I just thought I'd try and help out.  Or
to further stir the debate, as the case may be.
