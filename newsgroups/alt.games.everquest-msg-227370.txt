i know, i make coldain tempers to sell, and i took mine off my trade 
mule after that stupid vendor problem. i could just see then deleting 4 
traderpacks of tempers figuring i went and looted them off the vendor.

I spent a long time, plat and cramped fingers making my temper....i 
would be seriously miffed if it got deleted because of others cheating=(
aru
and i am earning the plat for my planar crafted armor the long hard 
way...2 pieces done, 3 to go=). helm and bracers vengeful fury=)
