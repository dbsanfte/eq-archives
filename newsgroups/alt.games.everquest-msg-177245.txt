I understand where you are coming from.  I hated the wait sometimes but it
did make the game seem really big.  I feel that that did make my early days
of EQ more interesting but now the wait would be a big burden.  When you
reach a high level you have experienced a majority of EQ.  You main purpose
is to go on raids, gain XP, and get phat lewt.  To do all of that you need
to get to the best zones quickly.  Without porting and now the Plane of
Knowledge you couldn't get to any of the high level zones quickly.  If it
was like that people would just cancel their account.  Waiting to play is no
fun when you are high level.  But for new, low-level people I can see where
having the portals takes away from the vastness of Norrath.
