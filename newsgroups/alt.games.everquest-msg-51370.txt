>Finally , something better than EQ.

The Final Fantasy series has been out for a long time.  Where have you been?

>Cancel your account , be ready for a great new game.

Cancel our account and buy a $60 (or whatever) game and buy a new account with

>See ya in DAOC all !!

>Verant, you suck, and it feels good to stop giving you my money !

If you hate them so much why did you wait for another game to come out before
