As I sit here, watching the dawn filtering thru the blinds (what sleep?) I
read this list and realise what they've missed out...

Meeting new friends down at the local Western Union office... because you're
in there 3 or 4 times a week cabling money to people selling you twink gear.

Learning about PC home-networking, because you need a 2nd (or 3rd) PC hooked
up to the net so you can PL your twinks.

Straying into Usenet and EQChatrooms during patch time... meeting
interesting new people... and flamming them to a crisp (and getting flammed
back) when you disagree with them.

Getting 'An Education' in the Sales Legislation of 38 US States, 9 EU
countries, and a couple of Asian ones, too... when those people you've been
sending money to over Western Union fail to hand over that Manastone you
paid big bucks for

Getting 'An Education' in Human Psycology by discovering that 92% of people
are "fucking morons" and that half of them are playing Monks in LOIO... with
the OTHER half playing Druids in DL .


... and if this scares you off playing EQ ever again?...

CAN I HAVE YOUR STUFF? :o)
