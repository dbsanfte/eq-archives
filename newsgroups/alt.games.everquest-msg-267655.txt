I don't have EQ2 and don't plan on getting it anytime soon, but I just
have some questions to you EQ2 players, just out of curiosity:

Are there any similarities between EQ1 and EQ2 regarding classes known
to be good soloers (like necros, druids and BLs in EQ1) ?  Or are
there different classes in EQ2 that seem to be good soloers?  

From the article I read in the Wired on-line magazine, it made it
sound like EQ2 was more group oriented, i.e., it's more difficult to
kill mobs solo in EQ2; do you agree?

I thought I read here before about how the player who first engages
the mob will get the experience, so if higher level player comes along
nukes the mob to death, the original player will still get the
experience (so KSing isn't supposed to be an issue in EQ2); am I
correct?

How would you compare the "death penalty" between EQ1 and EQ2?

Those are just a few questions I could think of for now, thanks in
advance!
