Its moot anyway though, for example the giant tov quest armors require
allied faction and the thurg quest armors require kindly or more. This
means that sneaking to get indiff won't cut it. Someday you are going
to have to trash either giants or dwarves raising the other. 

What faction is required to do the coldain boot and gloves quests in
Kael? I farmed these for a bit with an sk who was giant friendly while
I stayed allied to your basic dwarves since I was so darn allied. The
sk went and did the quest of course.
