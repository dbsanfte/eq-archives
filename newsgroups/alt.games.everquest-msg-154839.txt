Do you have a cite for this please? Never heard it. And the /guildleader
command is supposed to fully shift the leadership of the guild, and all
command prompt abilities to the new person. Particularly if the old
leader then quits or is /guildremoved by the new leader or an officer,
then AFAIK they have no access or powers over that guild whatsoever.
