I don't know about you, but I had all of that stuff for almost a year before I
came back to EverQuest, and I spent my time in a MUD instead. The only thing
that has changed is that I am out the cost of the Kunark package (original +
kunark included) and the Velious expansion, plus 10 bucks a month (I do the
monthly because I never know when I might have to pack up and haul off to
another country, much less whether I will have time to play EQ in the next 3 or
6 months).
