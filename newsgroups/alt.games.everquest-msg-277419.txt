That statement is contradictory though. I got a quest for kill some
epic mobs in Stormlord, so going by you first sentence they should be
soloable (since I need them for a quest) but the second sentence says
they shouldn't!! I do agree named mobs should be much harder to kill
but not possible to solo when they are green. Like most heroic mobs are
now. I've soloed a few named mobs while they are green.

I've heard SOE want outdoor areas to be for solo or duos and indoors
for groups. Sounds good to me as there is a clear line. You know in
advance any quest in Stromlord is aimed at groups and anything in
Antoinca is for solo players.

Wondering around Thunderring Stepps last night it would seem most mobs
are now solo. I previously stated I disliked that place because it was
a too bigger a step up from Antonica and hard to solo. Now, I think
it's a great place! Not like my first experience of it where there
were a few mobs I could solo and loads of heroic mobs. You had to group
and more so needed a perfect group (ie tank, healer and 4 DPS). Now you
can solo most things. And if you do group you don't need a prefect
group to do so.

Mentoring is also a good idea. Allows you to play with lower level
friends but also to do content you otherwise missed.

The game is far better for all these changes. Before hand once to hit
20 you had no option but to group now you can do both. Group still
gives more exp and allows you to kill mobs sooner. But it's no longer
mandatory, which is a much much better (and the fact you don't need a
perfect group makes it better still!)
