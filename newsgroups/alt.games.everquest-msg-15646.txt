Oh yes, of course. I am a halfling warrior follower of Rallos-Zek and am
level 46. I could care less about Erudin, but if possible would like to be
non KoS there. Anyhow, so far, i have killed in the Warrens, killed a few
low level wandering NPC's in Tox Forest. The sentinels conned red to me, so
thats definately out of the question. Thank you for taking your time to help
me.
