I don't see the problem in AFK parking your pet to kill something.. mages
have very few breaks, their only way to solo is using their pet, and that
means the pet more often then not takes 50% of the exp

It wouldn't be so bad if mages were desired in groups, but thats not true at
all

A mages pet is significantly lower level then the mage, in many cases this
means a mage pet can't solo a mob thats blue to the mage (I tested this last
night as it happens)

If the mage is prepared to risk an unrezzed death (if he dies and isnt back
in time to be rezzed) wheres the problem in him using his pet to make a
little exp?

Anyway as for my test last night, I tested the single spawn skele in DL,
most pops were light blue (which means tiny exp, then half that exp because
the pet takes 50%) but when ever a blue skele popped, it instantly ran to my
magician (who was sat right at the top of the hill out of harms reach).

So soloing blue mobs in this manner in the 50's isnt possible.. regardless I
wanted to test if a pet could actually kill the mob (pet was re-summoned
over and over till it was con blue to a level 59)   Anyway the pet died.
