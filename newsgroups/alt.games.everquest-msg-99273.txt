Agreed. I still haven't been able to generate any data one way or the
other about post thirty, or the hell levels themselves, so it may well
be a non-issue. Something to keep our eyes on, though.

100% agreed. I know that, while I feel a *bit* guilty about getting
pre-twenty xp so easily in Kurns, I think there's a very good chance
that this will drive more lowbie players into the dungeons and start the
school of hard knocks there earlier.  From that aspect, I agree that
this could have a positive influence on the end game. If more people had
ANY serious dungeon experience before they hit late forties or fifty,
then KC wouldn't be the unbearable hellhole that it is on Xev, and (from
what I hear) most servers.  By contrast, the Hole, Seb, and Chardok seem
to be where you find the nicest, easiest to get along with players
cooperating, and nary a cry of "TRAIN!" fills the air all night long.
