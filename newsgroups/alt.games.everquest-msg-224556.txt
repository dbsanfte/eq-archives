Defend the greifer? That comes out of left field, as far as I'm concerned.

To quote:

Why did she do this?  I think I can reconstruct it.  She had the 
birdbath open without realizing it.  When I came along and asked in a
not-entirely-polite manner for her to stop using it, it got her dander 
up. She'd show me a lesson.  So she began the charade, hoping to get 
under my skin and to punish me for the way I asked her to stop using the 
birdbath. When I petitioned her and a guide came along and forced her to 
move, she lost the game she had been playing with me.  That made her 
unhappy, and she took the game a step further.  She somehow thought the 
fact that she was an officer in her guild gave her special powers that 
would get me removed from my guild.  Plus she had another character, an 
SK (who may or may not have been her husband; I suspect the same player 
behind both toons) who had been on the server for a long time and knew 
people.  So she'd use this character's influence to pay me back for 
beating her at the game she had initiated.  Again, she overestimated how 
much influence he would have.

His theory, (a good one I believe fwiw) is described using phrases like 
'she lost the game she had been playing with me'  or 'she began the 
charade'...

I merely observed that I, at least, would not have characterized a 'him' 
along the same lines -- using the same gentler, somewhat patronizing 
phrasing that was used, and would have instead called him something 
along the lines of an arrogant asshat with a chip on his shoulder. 
(Which is effectively the same thing really, but yet is not a mental 
picture I routinely apply to women).

And I wondered whether Monuals choice of phrasing was subconscious, or 
deliberate. And whether he would have applied the same phrasing to a 
'male' antagonist.
