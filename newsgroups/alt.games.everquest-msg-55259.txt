Me, too, but I felt sorry for her.  I had been chatting off and on with her 
and she had told me it wasn't her first char, so I didn't offer her $$$ to 
make up for the death, so I pulled a red-2-her beetle, got it down to about 
5% life, mezzed it, blurred it 2 times, and had her kill it.  She said that 
easily made up for the EXP she lost and was happy.  Not that she was mad or 
anything, she also thought it was interesting that the Chanter killed her.

Damn, that was a hell of a run-on sentence up there.

One of the things I was hunting for were the Highland Lions.  My friend is 
looking for a Fleeting Quiver, so I was wanting the rare HQ pelt drop.  My 
friend shows up on his way to EK for the event and we're both in the Gypsy 
camp chatting and he asks me which pelt it is I'm trying to get for his 
quiver, so I tell him "The HQ Lion skin from the Highland Lions, VERY rare 
drop apparently and I hear they sell for 300pp."

He replies something to this effect: "Well, this vendor here only wanted 
3pp 5gp etc.. for this one."  Sheesh.  One was sitting on a Gypsy and I 
never even bothered to check. Duh.
