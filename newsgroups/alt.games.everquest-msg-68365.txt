  Eh, I stopped playing my druid at level 42, but I managed to kill
GrimFeather a few times before then.  I'm not sure exactly at what
level I did it at, though.

  He is quick, so that is something to be aware of, but if you stand
at a distance before casting your snare spell, you should be okay.
Keep your fast casting root memorized.  Tangling Weeds supposedly
casts in half a second... that might be one to keep memorized too.  I
remember employing a range of tactics against him... root-DoTing,
kiting, fear kiting... I don't remember which work best, but I think
they all worked okay.  The thing is quick enough though to make kiting
and fear kiting kind of difficult, even when it's snared, if I recall
correctly.
