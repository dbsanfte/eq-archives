I'm afraid I'll have to go with Jazz on this one.   Over the last few
months, I've seen about 15 people complete the warrior epic.  For each one
it was a step up in aggro weapons, and usually a big one.  In that same
time, I have heard of Vanikki being up a whole one time, and never been on a
raid that has found him alive.  (I was already committed to a bard Trakanon
when I heard he was up, and the public was hitting him.)   And not for lack
of checking.   For a couple months, a friend of mine was checking the zone
nearly every time he logged on.

Swiftblade is a nice weapon.   I use it myself in the offhand, due to the
superior HP and DPS over the blue epic blade.   But I had it before I got my
epic, and let me tell ya... it can't hold aggro for shit, if thats all you
have.
