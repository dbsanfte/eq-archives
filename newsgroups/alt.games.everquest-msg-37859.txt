Keep in mind however, that crushbone orcs share faction with Indigo Brotherhood
in Neriak.  You may not want to hose that faction.  You can't buy food and drink
there, but you can sell at the druid rings in bb and Steamfont.  Also unless you
killed something elsewhere you should be dubious which will allow you to bank
and not be kos to the guards in G'fay (basing these statements off an Erudite
necro, which i would assume have same base faction as your SK)
