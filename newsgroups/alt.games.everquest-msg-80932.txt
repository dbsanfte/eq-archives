According to a post on Caster's Realm ( see 
http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=755 ) you have to heal more than 
960 points with complete heal to be more efficient than superior heal.

I did the math myself and came up with a figure of 979 HP though.  Check it 
yourself and decide.  400 mana divided by 250 mana is 1.6, multiply by the 
number of hitpoints you heal with superior heal and you get the figure needed 
for efficiency with CH.  Your mileage will vary according to how much mana you 
save with specialization, etc.  Maybe someone can supply those numbers?

So to decide whether to use CH I ask a tank how many hit points he has once I 
have buffed him.  If it's under 1200 I don't bother.

And as for the long cast time, you need practice to get used to timing it right. 
  CH is now my favorite spell (my cleric is level 40).  I don't even mem it 
unless we have a big tank that can hold agro, but when I get to use it, it's fun.
