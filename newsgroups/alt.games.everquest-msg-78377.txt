Nope, that's the Main Tank (MT).  The MT and MA are often the same,
but they don't have to be.  The MA is the person others are supposed
to /assist in order to target the mob.  The purpose of the MA is to
make sure that everyone is on the right mob, so you don't have people
hitting or nuking mobs that the Enchanter is trying to mez, for
example.
