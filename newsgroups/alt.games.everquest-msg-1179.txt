Feel free not to like Biz...hell, I had him in my KF for about 6 months
before reformatting my hard drive, reading more of his posts, and seeing
that he likes the game and nice players as much as I do.

That's why I still haven't KFed Alex Mars, but I HAVE KFed people like
Freek, Red Kilt, and MadBomma.  None of them care about the game, just their
own sorry asses.

I'm sure that if you enjoy the game and like good, nice players and aren't
so hung up on worrying about cussing in newsgroups (I DO petition people who
cuss in-game and get defensive when you ask them to cool it) you won't feel
the need to KF or hate him.  But if you do, ADD him to your kill file...I'm
sure he won't mind.  You use Outlook Express 5...just click on one of his
posts, then click on Message (top of screen) >> Block Sender.  Voila!  It's
that easy.

If you're a sorry-assed fucking powergamer with no regard to anyone but your
own ass then just jump in with the likes of your brethren (the ones I
mentioned above).  They need all the help they can get.
