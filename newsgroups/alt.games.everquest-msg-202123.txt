I used to have  a similar type pc and upgraded from a Matrox 16mb to a
geforce2mmx 64mb and the improvement in graphical lag was really quite
something in some of the old zones the OP wants to play in.... also made
luclin/pop playable at minimum settings.

Maybe the geforce 4 wont work, but a lesser upgrade will deffinately make a
very real difference.
