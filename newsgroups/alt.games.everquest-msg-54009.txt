One of my alts was in Qeynos when i heard  beggar in ooc asking for
items. Beggar was a lvl 5. It seems he would never shut up. Then a very
high lvl Wiz started chatting with beggar. At this point i was near the
gates where both the others were also and watched the spectacle. Wiz
tells beggar to join with him for a special "gift". Beggar does. Next
thing i see is Wiz casting and beggar is gone. Asked Wiz where beggar is
and he replied "Skyfire". Did a  /who all beggar and sure enough lol.
