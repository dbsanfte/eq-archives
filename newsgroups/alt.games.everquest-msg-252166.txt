I didn't say that.  I said that IF that definition of "effective" is 
used, then a class that can solo 2 out of three mobs just needs a little 
more player skill.

I disagree that that is a useful definition of "effectively" here though.

My warrior soloed a good deal... and it was an arduous process, filled 
with a great deal of standing around healing, a great deal of picking 
only single pullables, a great deal of running to zone.  It was clear to 
me why eventually this would end up yeilding so little exp per hour that 
it would become a laughable endeavor.

Not because he'd necessarily die a lot, but because the time per kill 
would be long, and the time between kills would be longer, and the list 
of killable targets would become pretty small.

Course with bind wounds cap raised to 70%, his killables list would go 
up, but his time between kills would just get longer.

No, again, you aren't listening to what I'm saying, you're making up 
some other angle.  I'm saying that a Good druid can go thru dozens of 
quads between deaths.  That a good bard can go thru dozens of swarms 
without deaths.  That there are members of those classes that can't do 
so doesn't mean the class is at fault.  I picked those two classes 
because they are among the best soloing classes, the fact that they 
happen to solo dozens at a time is beside the point.

If the ratio disturbs you, how about shaman, a class that mostly kills 
singles.  Most shaman can very reliably kill low reds thru most of their 
carreer.  Yet I'm sure I can find you some who can't solo blue mobs 
without dying one time in three; soloing as a shaman takes a bit of a 
different attitude than grouping as one, and things can indeed go sour 
quite rapidly if you're doing things wrong.

Hey now, if it helps, my cleric soloed half of most levels from 20 to 
65, my bard soloed about half of each level to 57, my shaman soloed more 
like 3/4ths his time from 1 to 52, and my warrior did solo about half 
the time from 1 to 30 (although I can't say he soloed half the exp of 
those levels)  My only character that hasn't soloed much is my current 
one, a mage who flew thru most of his levels in a regular LDoN group or 
hanging out killing stuff with AGE friends.

I enjoy soloing, and generally have made a point of trying it with 
different classes.

Success, it seems to me from personal experience and from observation, 
is achievable with almost every class (rogue may be an exception).

Effective success, though, thats a lot harder to attain.

My cleric only soloed so much because I'm pigheaded about it, with 
almost any partner he could make more exp per hour, and that was before 
the radical raise in group bonus.

My bard, on the other hand, only grouped so much because he was hanging 
with friends and having fun, or because I was trying to learn bard 
grouping skills.  When exp alone was what I was after, solo was easily 
10 times as effective... course that again was before the massive group 
bonus thing.  Perhaps now its only twice as effective!

Note that the above descriptions utilizing "effective" are by my 
definition, something along the lines of "decent exp per hour compared 
to a normal group", rather than yours "not dying one time in three"; if 
the latter was true, every class I've played has been effective at 
soloing, once I worked the bugs out with a new location/level/mob type.

Hmm, except maybe my mage.  He doesn't solo all that well by your 
definition OR mine.  Some folks swear by them as soloers, though, which 
suggests to me that I'm just not good at soloing him.  Again, this fits 
my complaint about your definition; its not that mages suck as a solo 
class, but that I suck as a solo mage player!
