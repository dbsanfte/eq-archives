[snip]

Same thing in my guild, and in the guild I was in before. The first
guild, where I spent levels 11 to 23, recruited low levels, had a lot
of members, had quite a few planar level. However, there wasn't much
guild activity for lowbies like me, and I didn't feel like I had much
in common with most of the higher members. I got disgruntled, spoke
with friends about their guilds (mostly they were much higher than me
and had guilds with 35+ requirements) and got recruited by my current
guild after grouping with them at Paw spires and having them after me
for three days :) The guild I left had a massive breakdown (I wasn't
the only one unhappy, it seems) and it's now rare to see more than a
few people online with that guildtag.
My current guild is quite small, probably 30 members or so. They
haven't actively recruited for quite a long while (so it was kinda
flattering to have them asking me to join :) ) and the influx of new
members is rather low, with a limit at level 20 for applying, level 15
for friends applying. This is more of a family guild, and when I
joined, most people were mid 20s to mid 30s with a couple higher
levels up to low 50s, mostly druids. Actually, there were a lot of
druids at all levels, one reason I hesitated for three days when asked
to join. There was quite a bit of high level runoff.
Now we have a bunch of low 30s, a bunch of high 30s, a bunch of mid
40s, and one of our newest members is a 55 enchanter. The druid
percentage seems to have dropped as the other druid players have been
working their alts up to these levels, and we're making efforts to do
some grouping as a guild and occasionally have small raids. Some
people still leave, but not as much as before. I don't know what will
happen once a bunch of us get planar level. We couldn't go raid a
plane on our own, we're not that big, but I'm hoping we can stick
together for a long while. (If/when my play hours will allow something
as lengthy as a planar raid, I am hoping to tag along on pickup raids
or with friends' guilds on a couple occasions. I won't need Sang K.
Choe type raids for a looong while ;) )
We had discussions about how to prevent the high end loss of players.
We discussed making alliances with other guilds, we discussed heavier
raiding, but many of us have weird playing schedules and can't easily
group at any time. We decided that trying to force our guild to become
more uber rather than being the family we were wouldn't work, so we
just try to group more and stick together as friends rather than force
things... and it's working out so far. By not pushing our development,
the fact that we're all growing together makes it easier to stay.
