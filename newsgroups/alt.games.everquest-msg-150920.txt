Some mobs can heal, and they'll cheerfully heal any mob within
their range which is below 50% health (or themselves, if you're
trying to kill the healer).  They'll even heal through walls.

At higher levels this gets more annoying, because they can
heal themselves for bigger and bigger amounts of HP, up to
and including doing a Complete Heal.

If your mob is being healed by another mob, the tactics you
can use are:

1.  Pull your mob farther away from the healer.  The healer
won't follow, and once you're out of healing range it'll
"forget" about the one you're beating on (unless it has already
aggroed on you and is trying to kill you, in which case it'll
follow no matter what and you move on to #2).

2.  If you can't pull out of healing range for some reason,
switch immediately to the healer and kill it *first*.

3.  When fighting a healer, use any "stun" spells you have
the moment it starts to cast -- if you time it well and the
stun isn't resisted, it'll interrupt the spellcasting of the heal.
Similarly, if you're using a shield, use the "bash" ability
when the mob starts to cast, as that also will interrupt
spellcasting if it lands.
