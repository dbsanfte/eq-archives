Well if this is the case why was she able to FD the giant skeletons, grizzly
bears, and lizard warriors?

I certainly expect that if I'm singing and hit her with a song while she's
pulling,
that she won't be able to FD and ditch the mobs, they will come for me.
Same thing if my cleric heals a monkey puller other than while he's FD....
(in fact I tell monks in a raid that I will never, ever heal them until I get a
tell asking for one)

But bard buff icons preventing FD from working.. well thats possible, and while
it will suck I can work around that, there's plenty of self only buffs and mob
target/AOE songs I can mix  in while we are doing fancy FD stuff.  Too, those
icons are click-off capable on me, are they on others?

I was in a Velks Village group a while back with a bard as our mezzer.  We
had a named and three adds in the camp, a little harsh but certainly
controllable...
when suddenly the bard vanished.  That was a tough fight and a couple rez later,

we pieced things together.  Bard was playing his AOE manasong, and village is
right over pit.  He'd been feeding mana to the pit area, and when they pulled
something
big and died, his name eventually came to the top of the Hate list.  Mob
summoned
him down there and left the rest of us high and dry
