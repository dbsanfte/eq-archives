You take a tome that is for your level or less and hand it to a 
guildmaster for your class; you'll find those in quite a few places but 
the simplest is POK.

Most tomes can be purchased from vendors, there are several in POK, and 
in your home town, but for some disciplines you might need to shop on a 
vendor for another class, or to go somewhere more obscure like the Shady 
area in EC.  And some tomes are drop only, so you'll have to go kill 
creatures that drop them, or shop in the bazaar for them.

At 30 you should already have several disciplines, including one from 
the first level that gives you an infinite ammo way to pull from range; 
throw stones.
