You don't have to kill anything but the PH for Begurgle unless you want to.
Here's how I did it.

When you enter the cavern, don't go in the bottom entrance. Swim up to the
roof of the cavern and sit on the top of the tower. The tower does not have
a top so you can see down  into the upper room.

The four mobs form a diamond. Deep is in one corner. The two unimportant
goblins are next to her on either side.

If there are 3 goblins the middle one is the PH. If there are two, the PH
has not spawned.

When the PH or Bergurgle spawn,you can pacify the other two and then nuke
the middle one and then ruuun to  pull him away from the tower where you can
kill him safely.
