I was playing with assorted ways to get my 56 iksar monk into a reasonable
faction with the barbarians. Giz Dinree is a dark elf of low level and
killing her over and over for several months might do the job but I'm not
sure. I noticed that anyone with a pet can easily kill her, but sometimes
she flees before i can kill her, and underwater combat is woeful.

 Are there any items which work for an iksar monk that summon a decent (lv
30?) pet?
