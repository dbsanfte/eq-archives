The real question is, does your guild condone dishonest players?  It's not a
difficult question and your choice is not difficult.  If you condone it, do
nothing.  If you don't, kick her ass out of the guild pronto.

See?  Easy.  You don't have to tell her about your alt, just tell her that
you have proof of her lack of maturity and ethics and that she's gone.  You
need not prove anything to her...I know of no democracy guilds.
