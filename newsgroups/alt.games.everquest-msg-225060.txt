As a mage that actually put his practice points into research in his early
years, I was 'over the moon' (or should that be over Luclin <grin> ) when
the new research came out. I was able to create high level and uncommon
spells (Burnout IV for example) and for the first time made some pp and was
able to upgrade. The most I ever had in the bank was 45k but that was soon
used updrading my main and twinking alts. How different it is now after such
a short period. Spells remain in my trader for weeks and often I dont sell
any. It's not that I've changed what I research (Muzzle of Mardu, Burnout
IV, Nature Walkers Behest, Tigirs Insects, Pox of Bertoxxulous, Acumen of
Dar'Khura and some others) I have found two reasons:
1. More people are able to research and sell the same spells which
introduces fierce competition and
2. The cost of many research components is at the point where it costs more
to make the spell than what you can sell it for.

Obviously the first is good for those that want spells (as an example
Burnout IV used to go for 1500pp, now there are 3 traders selling them from
between 250 and 500pp. I'm on Antonius Bayle btw)

The second is more of a problem IMO. Those sellers that do their homework
into the use of the components obviously realise that they are used to make
rare spells. They then put the component price at what is a ridiculous
amount. Here's an example

Pox requires 3 components: Words: Agony and Revenant and Flake of Lodestone.
Agony has been up at around 10k
Revenant bet 1-2k
Flake around 1k

It requires a high skill for the combine (190+) else risk of failure is too
great but the risk is there. The spell itself was up recently for
8k.(Another example is Tigirs Insects, currently up for between 4.8k to 8k
on several traders) Only 61+ spells are now being sold for much pp and
research itself is not the money maker it once was. What I find a little
fustrating is that the components are used for other 'lesser' spells too, so
those spells dont get researched as I doubt anyone would pay 10k for a
component for a lower level spell (Words of Agony are also used for DMF, lvl
49 necro spell). Dont get me wrong, I'm not after loadsa pp (I have about 4k
in the bank atm) but it looks like I have two options to bring in the pp:

1. Farm the components myself
2. Find another way to earn money

The most I have ever paid for a component (and will ever pay) is 3k.

This is obviously just one area of the game. Other tradeskill areas have no
doubt suffered too. I also find it incredible that you can buy, say
tailoring components that when combined sell back to the merchant for much
less than the sum of the components. You would expect just a little profit
rather than the reverse. With the advent of the new equipment many of the
old skill combines are as good as worthless other than to skill up on. They
would never sell. Whilst SoE concentrate on other aspects of characters, I
wonder if they'll ever take a look at other aspects of EQ economy to bring
them up too
