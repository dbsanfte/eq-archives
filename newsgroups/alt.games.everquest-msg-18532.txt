I don't really see why the number of memmed spells should go up for higher
level players.

How about being able to memorise all of the lower level spells, but higher
level spells would take much more of the limited memory that is at hand, and
therefore you might only be able to memorise one or two of the lvl 60
spells.

This might be good for those that miss the risk and thrill of looking at a
spellbook while they meditate.
