this is in regards to your programming skills and the lack there of them.
bigger is better. intense just means you drink more and so on and forth. now
as for the 256 requirement who doesn't have that in there computer that they
are running eq on right now. ram is so cheap right now how could you not
bump it up??? hey if i spend 40 bucks to jump my computer from 256 in a
single slot to 3 * 256s, i mean hey hella speed equals no lag no drops
unless a zone crashes and hey my necro is good to go. hell even my cleric is
loving just 256 right now. for all you who raid with casren and allgood you
know what i am talking bout. hail the gods of the sky for i will never die.
maybe i am just babbling on and on but the graphic that i have seen so far
from all the testing demos that verant and sony ent. have showed off have
looked awesome. so any how, who are you to judge a game?
