That's the first I've heard of anything like that. oO Well, if no one
zoned in, it shouldn't have registered a fail. If you're really
concerned about your record (most people I know don't give 2 bits
about it...), GMs might be able to remove the fail. I've heard of them
removing fails for confirmed bugs that cause them...
