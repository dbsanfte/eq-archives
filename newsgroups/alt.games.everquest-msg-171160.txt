His pet stuck around because it was charmed when he died.  They have
monkeyed with the behavior of PC pets charmed by other PCs in the
past, it used to be one of the few remaining exploits to defeat the
NODROP tag (give NODROP weapon to pet, duel and have pet charmed by
opponent, [not 100% sure of remaining steps, never did it myself]),
so I'd have to see somebody actually use "/pet get lost" successfully
on a pet charmed by an NPC before I'll believe it's that easy.  Charms
cast by NPCs do differ from charms cast by PCs, and the charm code
always seems to be at least a little buggy.
