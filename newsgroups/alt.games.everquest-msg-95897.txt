Just wanted to mention that a pet does not have to do 50% or more of damage
to mob... it has to out damage group to get exp...

so if you have 2 pets in group... one pet gets 34% of damage dealt... other
pet 33%... group 33%... the exp would be divided including pet because the
pet outdamaged the group and 'got the kill'

no where does verant say 'ONLY if pet gets more than 50% of damage'...
Verant says if your pet outdamages group...

Least that's how I see it... don't mind me tho :) I play an enchanter and
for some reason i don't use my pet much
