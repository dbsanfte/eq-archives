    What sort of money do we have to play with, how much weight do you have
to use? Comparing with my monk twink, these are the areas I see as being
projects:

Shoulders: Acrylia Reinforced Mantle has nice AC, and STA/HPs.
Back: there's a few cloaks out there with a ton of +HPs, like Shimmering
Terror Hide. They're mostly down in the 1 K or less range, too. Go to the
Bazaar and do a monk, back, HPs search.
Weapons: my monk is using the freebie Goranga club from Maiden's Eye (No
Drop, ask politely if you can loot one from a group killing them) and a SoS
offhand. At the very least you should look into the SoS for offhand - at
17/28 it's hard to beat for sheer damage and for aggro control.

    Everything else looks about par for the course. I don't like that neck
item much for the low AC, but the HPs are good and you can put off the
upgrade there.
