Many apologies from the newbie 36 shaman.  But the version of malo I have at
this level can be resisted.  Good to hear that the level 60 version cannot.
But point still is about time and once I get this toon up to where my
Warrior was I am sure that the time used to Malo before slowing will be
brought up in grps.

Thanks,

LM
