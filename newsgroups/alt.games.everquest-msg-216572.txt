Hello Fellow EQ'ers,

Well well well, Sony has finally released an expansion with teeth to
it.  This has not occured, IMHO, since the Kunark expansion!  What I
am seeing from other players and my own personal opinion is that
guilds don't matter the way they used to pre-LDoN.  Thank God for
this!  There are a few reasons for this:

1)The items purchased at LDoN camps rival and eclipse Vex Thal drops! 
No more having to join the top guilds to get the top drops.  Only the
Plane of Time offers better drops, and they are VERY hard to achieve.

2)In order to get Plane of Time drops, you have to be a fustrated out
of work person who is playing EQ 8-10 hours everyday, and be in a top
tiered guild that WORKS to get the drops.  This means as soon as you
log into EQ, you are DEMANDED to attended a guild raid somehow
connected to PoTime.  Very little personal character development. 
Very litte relaxing fun ...

3)Most high end guilds are ran by assholes who care nothing about
other people's time and money spent to play the game.  Everything is
hurry up, we need that uber uber super uber item, chop chop ... don't
go anon or you will be deguilded ... chop chop!

4)By playing LDoN you are guaranteed the item.  No more ass kissing
and brown nosing the guild leaders/officers. No more favoritism or
clicks withing the guild.  You make 20-25 successful adventures in
LDoN you WILL get that VT+ quality BP or Cloak.  No more of this DKP
crap and NEED BEFORE GREED SHIT (NGB is just another way of saying, 'I
want that'.  Lets not kid ourselves).

5)I work for a living.  I am up at about 7am and home about 6pm,
sometimes alot  later depending on the Oracle database or the Sun
VR480 or the Veritas backups or the network going down or the ...  get
the picture ... I WORK for a living.
As a result, I can't be there for every guild raid, every epic
attempt, every exp group. LDoN allows me to play on MY time whem I
CHOSE.  Thank God for this!!!  I am actually enjoying the game now for
the first time in a year or two!


Ok those are the main reasons I can think of. I have noticed more and
more guilded players leaving guilds to play LDoN.  I have also noticed
snubbing of LDoN and non-guilded players by the high end guilds; this
is to be expected.  Just think, a year ago, VT drops made you a "bad
ass" ... not anymore.  Now the
easy going, laid back individual can play at her own pace, and get the
same quality stuff that was only accessable by the "uber people". 
Well things have changed, and I guess I can understand why the "uber
people" are resentful ... all that time ... all that ass kissing ...
all that commitment, and now here comes "Johnny new commer" and he has
parity with the Great "uber" player. I love it!

I am unguilded, and see no reason to ever become guilded.  Guilds are
nothing more that a way for poor quality players to leech from those
who know how to research, plan, and play the game.  Pick-up raids, GM
events (Stormhammer), and friends have allowed me to attain epics,
PoG, SS, TV, and other high end No Drops.  Guilds only screw-up the
fun.

Just think, you click on the EQ icon to have fun, not to log in just
to "goto work" for some guild.  Guilds come and go all the time.  We
all know this, so why bother.

Ok, if you agree with me fine.  If not, that is fine too.  This LDoN
expansion is worth every penny I payed.  I recommend it to all you
independant, self-thinking, self-leading EQ players.  Oh and for the
"worker bee" players as well!
