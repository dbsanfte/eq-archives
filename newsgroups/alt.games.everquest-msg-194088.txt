Overall, I like my Dell.  Decent performance at a reasonable cost.  This is
the second Dell I've bought for my own use.  I will say that Dell's much
ballyhooed tech support has gotten dramatically worse over the last couple
of years.  Three or four years ago, their support was outstanding.  Today, I
would rate it merely adequate.  Next computer might or might not be a Dell.

The whole RDRAM thing is confusing and annoying.  The long story short is
that RAMBUS, the company behind RDRAM invented it quite some time ago and
has spent the last few years fighting off patent issues and infringers.
RDRAM is still marginally faster than DDR Ram, but you pay the cost for the
proprietary design of RDRAM.  Based on what I could see by watching memory
prices for the last year or so, RDRAM is NEVER going to have the price drop
that other types have had.  In fact, there are probably less machines being
built with this architecture today than a year ago.  Sad, but true.  I
bought more RDRAM now because the supply is only going to decrease in the
future.
