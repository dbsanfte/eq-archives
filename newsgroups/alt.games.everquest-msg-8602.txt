Oh, it's safe to cast about 99% of spells that don't do damage.  That one
percent that you shouldn't cast are those that dispel magic (or you may
dispel the mez).

Druid root does damage...druid snare does not.  So the druid should snare.
Necro's snare does damage, so they can't cast it.
Most of the other classes can safely root.
Shaman can slow the critter down.
There's probably lots of other spells I'm not mentioning, these just seem to
be the main ones at level 51.

DOTs obviously do damage, so you don't want to cast it.  Even one hp damage
is enough to wake it up...and KEEP it up if the enchanter tries to mez it
again.

The main thing to remember is to use that /assist key (or type /as after you
target the primary tank) and don't cast damage spells on anything but that
target.
