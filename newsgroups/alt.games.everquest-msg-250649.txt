I am having a ball at the moment soling in all the old world original zones.
I see people have had issues with the latest expansions but that doesn't
affect me bumming around Antonica, Odus and Fey. I just finished spending
two days slumming it in Najena getting the broom/stein/torch/shovel for my
baby mages minor focus quest items. Nice little dungeon that one.
