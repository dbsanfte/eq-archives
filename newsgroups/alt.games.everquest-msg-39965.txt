One of the easier ones to get is the Traveller's Pack, 8 slots,
20% WR, Large items, just keep killing Rathyl (in Najena) over
and over again until he drops it.

He also drops a less desirable weight reduction pack (more often
than the Pack itself), called the Traveller's Pouch, only 4 slots,
25% WR, small items only.
