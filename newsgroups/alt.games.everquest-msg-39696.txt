    They got what they deserved. I live 15 miles from Rainbow farm and the 5
day standoff is all everyone talks about.
    If you are a criminal, armed, shoot at law enforcement officials (state
police airplane) and civilians (Newscenter 16 WNDU helicopter), and then
point your weapon at police, what do you think they will do? Name for me one
armed standoff with police where the outcome was the police just go away?
Tom Crosslin burnt all the buildings on his property but the one he was
holed up in. About a day after Crosslin was shot, Rolland Rohm set fire to
the final building and confronted state police armed with a mini-14. Both of
them were losers, not heros.
