Precisely. Quite frankly I prefer that when someone wants to remove 
money from my accounts that there be a 'slight inconvenience'. That 
gives me great comfort.

Given that they didn't come back for the rest for over a month I most 
certainly would. My credit card on file with them is a convenience so 
that they can bill me once a month as my subscription comes up. Its not 
an open wallet for them to pick through whenever they get an itch.

That they 'forgot' to bill me something is fine. I'll gladly pay. But 
send me a bill.

Making mistakes is a costly process. I suggest SOE learn to avoid them.

For starters that only accounts for it being maxxed out. The card could 
easily have expired or been cancelled in the meantime... for any number 
of reasons.

And I don't recall authorizing them to charge any cards at all for their 
"billing errors". In my case, SOE has made several billing errors on my 
accounts over the years. From double billing me for expansions, to 
failing to terminate billing upon an account closure, to refusing to 
refund what they had deducted AFTER the account had been closed until 
legal action was threatened, and so forth. 

No, SOE makes too damned many mistakes, and they haven't earned any 
trust. To further abuse that trust with more mistakes and then 
authorizing themselves to help themselves to the difference needed to 
fix them only increases my annoyance.
