Damn how many people have died playing DAoC? This is newsworthy if
people are actually dying while playing a video game.  Are you having
trouble comprehending the difference between reality and fantasy
again?  A warGAME is not the same as a WAR.

Yeah there's never any newbies with no skill, who actually grow in
skill over time and countless "deaths". Nah all paintball players are
either natural born killers or perpetual newbs and this status is
genetic.

There are rules in place in DAoC too. Safe area is safe, frontier
isn't.  Go there and you risk getting killed.  Hey that looks just
like the rule you stated above for War. Perhaps that means DAoC is a
Wargame. Whodathunkit!!!

I don't know, Halflife Team Fortress Classic still has thousands of
servers 3 and  half years after it was released. Tribes and tribes 2,
counterstrike, Unreal, all have hundreds of servers as well.  Seems
pretty successful to me.
