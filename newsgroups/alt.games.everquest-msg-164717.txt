	Actually he was wrong a lot of the time, as he misinterpreted data and/or
overextended himself inductively, making statements about classes and tactics
he had no real experience with.  He knows nothing about Rangers, for instance,
but will happily pontificate to me about how to play my class.

	He was also one of the people who said I would NEVER be high level, NEVER
go to the planes, NEVER have good equipment, NEVER have my epic, etc.
