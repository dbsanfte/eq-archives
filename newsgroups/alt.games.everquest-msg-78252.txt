The results of my readings, i'm far from a guru...

1) You want a fast weapon in your primary hand. This helps you build
and maintain agro, interrupt casters and gain the most from your
primary hand weapon bonus...which kicks in about L28 and up. Although
you still want the weapon doing good damage as well.

2) The second hand swings independantly and doesn't get a damage bonus.
As a result the ratio (damage over time) is the dominant concern. Although
the agro and interrupt possibilities still encourage a reasonably fast
alternate weapon.
