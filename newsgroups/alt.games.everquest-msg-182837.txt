They don't just wake up and decide to be #1 guild, and it happens.  It takes
a lot of hard work and effort from *somebody* for a guild to be killing the
top level mobs.

Effective communication, leadership skills, members who listen and follow
orders, people who put in the required work and effort to progress...

I don't disagree to a certain extent - being in an uber guild doesn't mean
you are an exceptionally skilled player, I see plenty of people in #1 guilds
that I know are nothing more than average... but they *do* have exceptional
players, people who are the core of the guild.

The reason why my guild has the DPS that it does, why we were killing mobs
long before other guilds, is because for over 6 months we farmed ST every 2
days, starting at 7am EST, netting at the very best, 3 primal weapons.

Other guilds didn't make that same effort, and are now lagging behind.  Sure
it doesn't mean were more skilled, but we damn well earnt our place ahead of
them.

FoH used a naked bard MA in a nToV raid, before you were probably even
killing HoT mobs.
Triton used a druid as MA for rhag2 long before emp had been killed.

Anyway theres no doubt their gear makes it easier for them, but like I said
the majority earned what they have, and the guild is succesful for a
reason.... you can't just get 40 random assholes and make a guild raiding
top level mobs.

If its that easy, why don't you "get VT gear" and make tunare you're bitch?
I mean, its as easy as clicking you're fingers and you appear in full vex
armour, right? :)
