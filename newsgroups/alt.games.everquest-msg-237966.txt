The cop out was introduced by allowing folks to use words like "omniscient"
and "free will" without explicitly defining them. Still, the point may be moot.


In my spare time, I'm a research philosopher. I've been writing an omniscience
program. It hasn't been going well lately because the executable takes up
an infinite amount of disk space, which is more than I have. Well, last
night a friend mentioned in passing the undocumented "omega-level optimization"
flag for my compiler. So I tried it and, after what seemed like forever,
wound up with a speedy executable less than 64k in size. Who would have
thought an omniscience program could run in DOS small memory model??

This baby implements Heffernan-style omniscience. Unlike other, lesser
forms of omniscience, this program knows EVERYTHING! The ui is pretty
simple. Text-driven, just type in a question of the form "Do you know X?"
where X is some thing, and it will look it up in its knowledge base and
reply Yes if it knows it, No if it doesn't, and "Stop wasting my time" for
a syntax error. For infinite length X, you can use "..." to save typing
on your fingers. As expected, it answered Yes to every question, no matter
what I asked. It is omniscient, after all. A snip of a sample session
below:

  Me: Do you know 1+1=2?
Orac: Yes.
  Me: Do you know what I will have for breakfast tomorrow?
Orac: Yes.
  Me: Do you know you are omniscient?
Orac: Yes.
  Me: Do you know the way to San Jose?
Orac: Yes.
  Me: Do you know splunge?
Orac: Yes.
  Me: Do you knwo 1+1=2?
Orac: Stop wasting my time!
  Me: Do you know 1+1=3?
Orac: Yes.
  Me: Do you know ...?
Orac: Yes.

Like so many other things, omniscience has moved from the impossible to
the actual.

Preliminary investigations suggest that omniscience does not seem to be a
necessary nor sufficient condition for sentience. Also, omniscience was
implemented at 02Mar2004 11:48PM. Did anyone experience a sudden gain or
loss of meaning to their life? Did anyone experience a sudden gain or loss
of free will? Your reports on may provide important evidence for further
research.
