/shrug then you'll be wanting the class listed too... every level has 
spells that have to be bought from unusual multi-class vendors (in 
FV/Iceclad/Shadowhaven/EchoCaverns/Katta Kastellum/HHK etc... 

Everyone I know figures out what they need -first- and where they are 
located and then goes and gets them. Its terribly inefficient not to 
mention inadequate to wander around PoK clicking and sifting. It would 
take forever, and you'd still miss some.
