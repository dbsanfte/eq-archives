I'm a 55 Wizard, so am quite familiar with our AE snare.

Let's compare Bonds of Force, the level 29 Wizard snare, to Ensnare, the
level 29 Druid snare.

BoF: 75 mana, duration 2 minutes, 2.5 second cast time.  AE range of 20'.

Ensnare: 35 mana, duration 10 minutes, 1.75 second cast time.

The AE range on BoF is very small.  It is rare to find two static mobs
standing the close together.  For example, consider the Wyverns in Cobalt
Scar around the zone out to Skyshrine.  BoF won't hit more than one at a
time there, even though pairs of them stand side-by-side.

Here's how a Druid starts a quad.  Run up and Ensnare something.  Run over
and Ensnare something else.  Repeat two more times.  Run in a tight circle
around the mobs until they are close together, and start AE nuking.  Mana
for snaring: 140.  Because Ensnare has such a long duration, no resnaring is
needed.

Here's what happens if a Wizard tries that.  After getting all 4, you've
spent 300 mana, and there's a good chance snare won't last long enough to
get through the kite, so you have to throw another one in at the start,
bringing it up to 375 mana spent on snaring.

So, instead of doing it Druid-style, Wizards start quads like this: aggro a
mob (hello, Staff of Temperate Flux!).  Jboot (or equivalent) your way over
to another mob, and aggro it.  Repeat two more times.  Run around in big
circles, with 4 pissed off *unsnared* mobs chasing you, until they are close
enough together for BoF, and then cast BoF.  Mana cost for snaring: 75.

So, if everything goes well, Wizards get their mobs snared for less mana.

However, if things don't go well (hello, resists!), so you need to snare
again, and then remerge the mobs, and maybe snare again. mana cost again
goes over Druid cost.

Besides the mana cost, there is the risk.  Dragging unsnared mobs around
over large circles to prepare them is a lot more risky that dragging snared
mobs around.

At level 51, we get an upgrade to BoF: Atol's Spectral Shackles.  Cast time
drops to 2 seconds, duration goes up to 2.5 minutes, range goes up to 25'
(which is still not enough to hit more than one of pretty much any pair of
static spawns, like the Wyverns), and mana goes up to 125.

I'd happily trade Atol's and BoF for Ensnare.
