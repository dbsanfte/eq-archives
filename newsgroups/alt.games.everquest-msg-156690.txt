No, it didn't.

Yay, save the newbies!  THINK OF THE CHILDREN!  Yep, I'm sure there will now
be a *ton* of easy places to go exp through 55 - 60 now...   of course, any
place that gives "challenging" exp at those levels, or any exp at all 61
plus will/would be completely packed.   Yay, we can go back to the old days,
when you had a choice between Lower Guk and Sol B as your two zones you can
continue to gain experience in...

I'm not worried about any easy exp spot.   I'm worried about what this is
going to do to my fun / challenging exp spot that I already go to.  Our
group basicly marches down into deep Chardok (or some similar zone, HS, The
Deep, Etc)  every time, and theres never anyone there.   (not even your
mythical 55-60 group that can't find a spot)...  now that it will be the
only section of the zone still blue, yeah sure.  Good luck.

You'll forgive me if I don't hold out great hope that they are going to add
fully adequate hunting to compensate for turning half of the "Ok experience
all the way to 60" spots immediately green at 61.  Thier track record for
planning has not been good.
