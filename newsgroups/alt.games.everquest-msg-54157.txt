I'm really more of the realist in EQ... Haste items for Warriors are rather
self-defeating unless it adds _a lot_ of AC. Your job is to take the
beating - not really deal it out. Although it is nice for the extra aggro it
creates, it also gets you smacked around more so the Cleric has to end up
healing you. In most efficient groups, you'll most likely have a
Bard/Enchanter/Shaman to deal out the Haste anyhow. For the most part, tank
melee damage is really more of a macho thing.
