I went on a Kael raid at 39. While Rapacious Subversion didn't do very much
to the healing clerics or the chanters, it was enough to make a difference
at critical times. Clarity at any level does not stack with the HP to mana
conversion spells. But I was lifetaping just fine on the very red mobs.

44 is the upgrade to RS, and that's when I become more useful. Will also
have DMF available then.

And that other young man should look into silk armor, or gossamer or even
damask. Silk is easily made.
