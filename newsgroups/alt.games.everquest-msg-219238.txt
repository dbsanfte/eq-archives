Spent a while in PoM in a duo and a three piece and the experience was
pretty nice.  Named bixie seemed to pop in the same place near the
fake ramp, shame it only seemed to have one average range item
(Amusing Bauble?) on its loot table.

Ghetto twink Shaman (me) and top notch VT geared Mage (my friend) were
able to kill it fairly comfortably even though it mitigated slow and
summoned.
