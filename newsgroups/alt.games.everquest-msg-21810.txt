I've noticed that almost every single time I've died in my mostly
soloing career has been because of mistakes made in a state of panic,
when a cool head would have seen me safely to the zone.

The most recent example is when I grouped with a nice 50-something DE
Necro --whom I guess only had me around for company, since at 26 I could
contribute little other than SoW to the fight-- to bring down Tarbul
Earthstrider in East Karana.

Well, the fight went badly, the pet died, the Necro died, and then
Tarbul wanted some payback for an ill thought-out damage shield I put on
the pet. I was in Wolf Form at the time, and Tarbul came at me slowly
(still under the effect of a Darkness snare), like a glacier on legs. I
couldn't bring myself to turn tail and run, I just backed up slowly,
thinking "Oh my, is he really *that* angry at me?" I know giants are
fast, but I think I could have made it to the bridge in time, especially
with the giant being snared, but nooo... 

At that point, the snare broke, and so did the spell of stupidity I was
under. I thought "time to haul ass, a_Hanrahan_01", and hit the Spirit
of Cheetah button. 

"your spell does not take hold"

Damn. I use Spirit of Cheetah so little that I never realized it
wouldn't overwrite Wolf Form. What do I do? I click off wolf form and
try to re-cast Cheetah. Does it work? Does it buggery. Cheetah has a 15
minute re-cast time. I think... Uh-oh. SoW or Wolf Form again... Argh!
What's that? What am I casting Cure Poison for? I need Prevent
Flattening instead! I just realized that I had been hunting Crag Spiders
until I grouped with the Necro, and Cure Poison was taking up my usual
buff hot-swap slot.

At this point, Tarbul is approaching at orbital re-entry speeds and
screaming for a piece of me, and my panic has reached truly
brain-boiling levels. What do I do? Cast Gate and hope for the best? No,
I run, un-Wolfed and un-SoWed, up the Highpass Hold ramp with a Named
giant hitting me in the back for a few hundred HP a pop, and thinking to
myself "I'm gonna DIE, my god I'm GONNA DIEEEEEEEE!".

I died.

Well, anyway... The necro, bless him, felt so guilty about my death (I
didn't elaborate on the details of my own stupidity) that he gave me a
nice Polished Bone Bracer. I was so happy that I gave him in return the
31 silk swatches he was short of for one of his quests (and which, at
the current price of silk were probably worth more than the PBB, but
what the hell). For the price of one death I got a valuable lesson
learned, a high-level acquaintance, a PBB, and a cautionary tale for
all:

Keep your cool.
