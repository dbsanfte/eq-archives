Ideally I want Outlook Express style thread sorting in descending
order. (Most recently started thread first), with replies dangling
below whatever message they are replying to

Fwiw, if I wanted to lose threading and just sort by date, then
clicking the date column should do it... but clicking the date column
now gives me the message that "This feature is only available in the
full version of Agent". Which surprised me... I'd have thought this
was a basic enough feature to be in the free version...

Hence my disatisfaction with the free version.
