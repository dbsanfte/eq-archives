Absolutely.  Skilling up IS what sinks cash.  Not many people do tradeskills
because the items don't sell.  The items don't sell because people don't
need them because they never wear out or deteriorate, so unless somebody
sold it back to a merchant or destroyed it then the first suit of banded
armor ever made is still on the server.  This is exactly what I'm saying.
"The raw tradeskill materials are priced right to be a money sink".  Now the
trick is getting the trade skill items to sell.  How would Goodyear for
example ever sell you another set of tires if the Goodyear tires you bought
in 1972 were still in perfect condition and never wore out?  What they would
have to do is offer you a super duper set of  "no-drop" Goodyear tires that
were better than those you bought in '72 :).

Okay.  Those a good examples.  I said that I probably didn't catch them all.
Many of those were added later on, as attempts to fix the economy and get
some money off the servers.  Certainly not enough to make for a working
economy though.

Yes, that is exactly the problem.  Players who start the game today on a
mature server are simply out of luck.  They can't make money with
tradeskills because nobody buys patchwork or banded armor and they don't
have enough money to get started with trade skills.  They can't sell the
items they get off of mobs for any decent money because most players already
have items 1000 times better that they twinked down from higher level
characters.  These players will have to struggle through the game with
barely enough money to survive until they hit the higher levels when money
begins to roll in.

The canyonous gap between the upper class and the peasant class very much
reflects the gap in many RL countries with poor economies.

I know you can't argue generalities with specifics, but to attest to this I
can offer the example of a friend who tried everquest at my recomendation
and quit for this very reason.

That is correct.  It would not lead to increased cash flow into the system,
but more no drop items would further decrease the exhcange of money from one
player to another which further destroys the vision of a player to player,
player driven economy.  It would also further reduce the "for trade only"
barter market which is still a viable and common form of "commerce" between
wealthy high level players.

This seems to be one of Verant's attempts to fix the economy retroactively.
However, the gems, you say, sell for 20 plat, but are used for a No-Drop
quest item?  So after the item is obtained, I take it there is nothing to do
but sell the gems.

The strategic use of certain no-drop items are attempts to get money off of
the servers, however, again, I say they cripple the player to player
economy.  So as you repair one aspect you harm another.  Verant knows this,
I'm sure.  I imagine this has them banging their heads against the wall
behind the scenes for ideas and in frustration.  To keep the economy moving
takes constant patchwork ideas and fixes and I'm sure it causes them to
expend resourses that they would rather use on different things.

No.  You are incorrect here.  With gambling you can have complete control
over the odds.  If the item that was the "prize" was worth 1000 plat, then
you could make it a prize on a game that costs 1 plat to play and has a
payout percentage of 85 percent.  That means you would, statistically, take
850 plat off the server for every 1000 plat item given away.  That is why
Casinos are constantly giving away cars, boats, etc. and people are
constatnly winning them, even on relatively low dollar games.  Because the
Casinos controll the odds and in the long run are sure to bring in more than
the cost of the car.

I don't expect gambling to be implemented because it is likely that gambling
is too touchy a subject to deal with.  It would be a controversial addition
at the very least.

Although I have no evidence of this, my guess would be that this is the
reason why the casino at HighPass never went "active" to begin with.

We will have to agree to disagree on this.  I believe it is very much not
what they want it to be or what they originally envisioned, and I think they
are having to spend much more time and resources than they would like
keeping it under control.

Like

Of course the price of an item is based on supply and demand (rarity) as you
say.  But the discrepancy comes from the fact that if you spend 6 hours
sitting in one place camping the same mob for a widget then you would expect
that widget to be relatively valuable.  But it isn't.  It isn't valuable
because, even though it took you 6 hours to get it, every other widget ever
obtained is *still* on the server.  The longer the server stays in existance
the more widgets exist on it, until they are a dime a dozen.  That is an
example of one of the discrepancies I'm talking about.

This example might apply in some cases, but in many others, especially in
the case of wealthy high level characters, they simply have more money than
they know what to do with (because there aren't enough viable sinks), they
don't need any more money, and they know that other wealthy characters (the
ones with the power to obtain the items they are looking for) are also
offering their items "for trade only", for the same reasons.  Money is of
very little value to them, and bartering is their economic system.  Quite
simply, the more money there is on a server, the less valuable it becomes,
and to those who have the lion's share, it's very nearly worthless.... "for
trade only".

Well, market cash prices are of very little value to wealthy high level
players.  As most of them have very little use for the cash they could
obtain for an item.  (see above).  The fact is, if platinum *had* value for
these players then they would accept it in return for their item.  When a
player says "for trade only" that means *no* amount of platinum is worth him
turning over his item to you.  It doesn't matter if it's 1000000000000
platinum.  He doesn't need it, because he couldn't use it to buy the item he
wants to trade for (see above).

It's odd that we seem to be in disagreement here, yet you seem to solidify
my point.  Let me try to make this point again by initially agreeing with
your statement.

New Servers.  That is exactly where patchwork sells.  On new servers.  As
with banded and all the other trade skill items.  Now, if those items
detiorated in some fashion and were A) of a value comperable to what might
be obtained from mobs, or B) the items from mobs also deteiorated or was of
use to only certain character levels, then these trade skill items would
continue to sell.  They do not continue to sell and therefore tradeskills
are not lucritive, not attractive to players beyond the first month or two
of a servers existance, and are not money sinks.

Very possibly not.  I wouldn't debate that point as there is really no way
to tell.  But it certainly has the potential to make for a workable economy.

What you want an economy to do.... well in a MMORPG anyway is allow every
character an opportunity to afford those goods and services, not the few who
were "there from the beginning" and are now a member of the upper class to
the exclusion of the lower.  You want money and items to change hands among
all the population.  You want items to be produced, sold and discarded, you
want that cycle to repeat and you want it to regulate itself.

It certainly was by design.  But not for obvious reasons.  The tradeskills,
I believe, were originally designed as just that... trade skills.  Things
that players could do to make useful items for other players, then sell
those items to make money.. etc. etc.  However, due to a lack of foresight
concerning the permanancy of items the trade skills were only useful and
used in that fashion for a very short time at the launch of each server.
The tradeskills were intentionally *retroactively* designed to cost a great
many plat to level up for the sake of creating a select few high level items
involving rare ingrediants.  This was a retroactive fix that was added later
to the game to try to turn the trade skills into something that might get
some money off of the servers.
