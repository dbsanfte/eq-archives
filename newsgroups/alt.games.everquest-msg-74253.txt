Point being, I don't know for sure that it's that way everywhere (I
can't imagine that it isn't, and another thread seems to indicate that
it is, in fact, universal); I usually qualify "X is broken" statements
if I can't confirm that the problem is global rather than local. 

But it looks like the dwarf is eating the quest item(s) everywhere and
likely to keep doing so until the programmers have time to attend to
him.
