}>My vote for wizards is the level 4 spell Fade.  The spell decription should
}>read something like this:
}>Causes caster to waste valuable time that could be spent running to guards
}>trying in vain to get his or her sad channeling skills to work.  Should the
}>spell miraculously channel through, it will buy the caster less time than
}>was wasted casting the spell to begin with.  This spell teleports the user a
}>maximum of 10 feet, and the monster gets to automatically know where the
}>caster appeared and land a couple "sucker punches" before the unfortunate
}>player can get his or her bearings.
}Also known as "shadow step" for Necros.  Yes, I too wondered "wth?"

}to a pulp 3 feet from where I'd started out, because I had to look

}yay spell :p

No, fade is just like shadow step except it doesnt move you as far. :)

However, Shadow Step -did- save my SKs life once, from a treant in SK.  
The secret is casting it over and over until the mob gets dizzy or you get 
lucky and get thrown in the same direction 3-4 times.  I'm sure it also 
helped that treants are slow.

There's some consistency to how it chooses where to move you.  it seems to 
prefer going downhill.
