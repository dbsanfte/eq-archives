Well, er, (how can I put this?) - yes.

Hint: they're animals.

You can fear kite them - a cast or 3 reapplying fear doesn't break the
mana bank and you won't get hit that way, allowing you to melee to save
mana.

You could also charm them (might not be viable if you're a low-CHA
halfling or something). For example, you could charm a one and have that
keep a second one busy, help it out with a DS or heals if necessary, get
some xp for the one your new pet killed, then all the xp for killing
your pet when charm breaks (since it'll be an easy kill, what with being
half-dead from fighting the first one). The charm thing is a bit risky,
and I generally reserved that at your level for charming green griffawns
as pets to take out red crag spiders for me (since the griffawn is a
serious undercon with regards to melee ability, it makes a great pet -
charm resist of a green mob, pet tanking ability of a red).

What I do with Griffons at level 33 for example (since I really, really
don't want to melee them) is ensnare, terrorize animal, Immolate DoT,
Creeping Crud DoT, then whack on its fleeing back, keeping an eye out
for spells needing to be reapplied. Since its snared, I can run away and
re-fear if that breaks without getting hit more than once or twice, and
if those hits did appreciable damage its now running away so I have
plenty of time to heal myself.
