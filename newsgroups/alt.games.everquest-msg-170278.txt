one limitation on the affliction focus: The haste line only works on a
spell with a minimum 3 sec cast time.  So it cuts down a 3 sec turgurs
to 2 sec, but does not affect the fast root spell with 1.2 sec
standard duration. Also, so far I have not found a click-item spell
that is affected by focus items (e. g. the shaman epic dot is not
extended).
