Erm... no. That's something I hadn't noticed... lacking all available
evidence to that effect. You, on the other hand...

That's the biggest pile of shit I've read all day. Congratulations on
a job well done... unless, of course, it comes naturally.

And monks are sooooo good at *taking* damage aren't they? The whole
purpose of a tank is to *take* the damage for the group. And I love
how you just insert "the only thing they lack is a taunt button". Yet
you still think they are at *least* as good at tanking as a warrior?
You and I have been playing radically different games.
