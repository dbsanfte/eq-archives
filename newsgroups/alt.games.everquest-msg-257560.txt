Good question=)

I know my game husband and I pretty much LDoN with each other and 
4 players to be scrounged later [in a manner of speaking] so I 
tend to be the default group leader. If I end up being the puller 
as well, I can be a trifle bossy, though I am pretty laid back 
normally. Usually I only have to ask tanks to get out of my 
targeting view as it interferes with wake of tranquility, and it 
will go through and grey out the gem then give me the no clear 
sight on target message...then I have to either wait for it to 
ungrey or hope the mob is low enough to use my bracer pacy on 
it...[that kept happening last night, which is why we had a few 
adds in the adventure=(]

I am disappointed that 2 of my favorite puller/tanks retired from 
the game=( but I do have a pool of about 20 really good adventure 
players for different classes that are still in game [at least on 
weekends=)]
