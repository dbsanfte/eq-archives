Get to Neriak if you can.  They have pretty much everything you need for
smithing in two areas- the foreign quarter and the guy in the underwater bar
in the little underground shop area.  Forges right next to both areas too,
along with a bank and everything else-
very convenient.




MINOR SPOILER BELOW




















However, they may not like you at first.  I had a troll shadowknight and i
believe everyone in Neriak (except for the trolls and ogres) was
apprehensive to me at first.  Do the red wine quest, it's very easy and will
raise your faction with everyone that's needed to do normal business there.
Give red wine to the vicar who's all by himself in the little pulpit off to
the side of a mage shop.
