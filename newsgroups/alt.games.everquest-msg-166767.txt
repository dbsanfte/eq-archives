In 200 years America went from a frontier to the most powerfull and wealthy
nation the world has ever seen. Capitalism and capitalism alone fueled that
. It is historically the absolute best system . Vhement denial of obvious

Everquest does follow all of the normal economic principles and could
enlighten some otherwise particularly dense people but it is by no means a
perfect capitalist model.
