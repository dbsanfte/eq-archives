  I'm not a PvP expert, but this is how I understand it works:

  Rallos Zek is the "free for all" PvP server.  Anybody can attack
anybody else.  If you kill someone on RZ, you get to loot all the coin
they're carrying on them, plus one item (it can't be a container or in
a container, and can'tbe NO DROP).  The ruleset otherwise is normal.
On the other servers, you can't loot items... only coins.

  Tallon and Vallon Zek are the "teams" servers... basically race war.
The teams are divided up pretty arbitrarily.  Shorties (dwarves,
halflings, gnomes) on one team, elves (half-elves, high elves, wood
elves) on another, the evil team (dark elves, trolls, ogres... and
Iksar(?)... can't remember if Iksar have their own team)... and humans
(barbarians, erudites, humans, Vah Shir.)  On these servers, you can
attack anybody on the opposing team.

  Sullon Zek is the newest server, and by far the "dirtiest" from what
I've heard... Verant has even instituted an experience bonus to get
more people to play there.  You are put on a team based on whether or
not your deity is good, evil, or neutral.  I don't think you can be
agnostic on that server.  I'm told that the "evil" team totally
dominates there.  Sullon Zek is more or less a "no rules" server.  You
can't attack anybody on your own team, but that is where the rules
just about end.  It is considered legal to train mobs on other people,
camp zone lines, kill people as they retrieve their corpse, camp
somebody's bind point... ect.  Though at least one player was told by
a GM to stop training people because he was under the level at which
you can be attacked.

  For more information, try to find a web site on the specific servers
or PvP in EQ in general.
