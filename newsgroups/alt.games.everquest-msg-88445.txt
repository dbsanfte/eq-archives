Verant knows who was the original person that set up each account.  As far
as they're concerned, that person is still the owner of the account.

Just call them up and have the original credit card numbers, CD keys, and
station numbers, and they should be able to change the passwords for you.

On the last case, if you've been paying for the account, the other guy has
no leg to stand on.  But if they've been paying for it while you were gone,
he has some moral ground on you.
