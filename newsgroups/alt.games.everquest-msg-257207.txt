This is no record setter, but my favorite jump is off the EW/Iceclad bridge.

I also find it amusing to jump into the pit in CC; my cleric would hit 
DA and try to miss all the bridges, my berzerk finds it more fun to try 
and hit every bridge and see how little damage he can take getting to 
the bottom as fast as possible.

The chasm on the way from HHP to the hunting area of EK is also fun to 
drop into; again, cleric hits DA and goes for the big drop, my bard used 
to use selos for max speed and take a running leap, and time the 
beginning of AoEagles so it would start as close to the ground as 
possible.  Course that ended up in a splat once or twice.

I remember during a halloween event years ago there were mobs with a 
massive knockback proc, we dragged one up to the top of a hill in EK and 
set up a carnival ride, charging people 5 gold; they would go in and 
melee the thing while standing in a certain spot, and when the proc 
would go off (normally throwing you back 20 paces or so), your starting 
altitude there up atop the hill would throw you all the way across the 
bottom half the zone and into the river.  My cleric would give you a 
free rez if you happened to miss water.  I was pleased to see how many 
people actually got into the fun.

> Anyone ever manage to survive a jump to the bottom of the Hole?

This is, or used to be, standard practice, there are several ways to 
survive it; if you jump from the right spot you can hit a little patch 
of water apparantly, or from another spot classes with safe fall often 
take as little as 600 damage.  But the most reliable way down is to use 
Divine Aura, which should last long enough to hit the bottom and take no 
damage.  So, everyone jumps in, trying to survive the fall, but the 
cleric (who's survival is practically guaranteed due to the DA 
parachute) then rezzes the rest, and presto, there you are next to the 
guy you probbaly came to kill, or at least halfway to your other goals, 
having skipped a long slog thru KOS see invis mobs.

Could be this isn't a good approach anymore, there may be KOS mobs in 
the landing zone which will decimate that cleric when his DA runs out, 
its been a long long time since I've done it; heck I haven't played my 
cleric more than a few hours in the past year.
