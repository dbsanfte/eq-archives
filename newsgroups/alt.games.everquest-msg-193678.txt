I was in the same boat last November....

I went with the XBox. 

Why?

1. Built-in Harddrive. You have to buy at least one $25.00 memory card
to save games on the PS2. If you have a lot of game saves, you will
need more than 1 memory card.

2. Splinter Cell. (An AMAZING game, and only avail on XBox at the time
I got mine....It's out for PS2 and PC now, so it's no longer an XBox
selling point.)

3. XBox Live!
If you have broadband (Cable/DSL) you can play against other people
online. If you want to play against other people online with a
console, XBox is the clear choice. 

4. Better graphics on the XBox. 
The XBox is simply better hardware. It came out a year after the PS2,
and has better system specs overall.That being said, having the best
hardware doesn't mean much if there aren't enough XBox titles that
interest you. 

The biggest downside to the XBox is the number of "good" games
available. The PS2 has the most top sellers and a HUGE library to
choose from (including all PS1 games) There are some great games for
the XBox but most of them are also on the PS2, and even the GameCube.
There are very few exclusive XBox titles that are "must-haves". I
don't regret getting the XBox, but I am disappointed with the shortage
of games. The games I do have are fantasic and worth every penny. I
just wish there was a wider selection.

The real deciding factor is really the game libraries. Do a search on
the games available to both platforms that YOU are interested in. For
instance if you want to play GTA3 you have to get a PS2 (it's
exclusive to the PS2).

I am NOT trying to talk you into getting the XBox. You can't go wrong
with either system as long as you know what you personally want and
expect out of it.
