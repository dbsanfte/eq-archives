I lurked on the UO boards for a long time and read lots of posts
from Raph Koster.

I never got the impression he "got it".  The group would be over-
flowing with complaints abot PK'ing...and he'd wave his hands
dismissively and claim it's just a "vocal minority" complaining.

Eventually, he'd start to "get it", just a little bit.  And then
he'd recommend something absolutely assinine like the players
should form anti-PK guilds to alleviate the problem.

Then he'd "get it" just a *little* bit more, and some half-assed
solution that's easily circumvented would be implemented.  And
when that didn't work, repeat the same.  And when *that* didn't
work, repeat the same.  He just couldn't admit when his vision
was wrong.  Which it often was.

Repeat this kind of scenario with dozens of other issues.  I
still don't think he "gets it".  He's got this Ivory Tower
attitude that says, "If it works on paper, it should work in
reality."  And he'll keep pushing and pushing his agenda and
ignore the realities of the situation.

If he's got a lot of input in SWG, I expect there to be A LOT
of problems with SWG.  Raph just isn't good at admitting when
he's wrong and seeing reality for what it is.
