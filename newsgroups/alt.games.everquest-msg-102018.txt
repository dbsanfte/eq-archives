Actually, it lists an "account ID" number. A GM can do a who all check
on the ID# and pull up whichever character on that account happens to
be on on the server at the time.

What a lotta people seem to have trouble grasping as that 2000+ people
online is going to put a heavy workload on 3 or 4 guide/GMs on at the
time. 1+hour to answer a petition at peak times isn't them being lazy,
it's them having to wade through 20+ other petitions that require
arguing with whiney, spoiled players, investigating training/etc,
checking logs, and so forth before they get to your petition. And
sometimes the queue is low, so an answer to a petition against you
within 15 minutes doesn't mean the GM/guide is playing favorites with
the petitioner.
