I was having this problem with my SK back when I was level 15 or so.  It
would take completely draining my mana 3 or 4 times to get my pet spell to
cast.  After cursing and kicking everything in sight about this, right
before I almost deleted the character, I made a horrible discovery.
Apparently I was so exited at level 9 about getting spells, I forgot to
train in channeling.  Something you might want to check the skill level of,
as I didn't see that one mentioned in your post.
