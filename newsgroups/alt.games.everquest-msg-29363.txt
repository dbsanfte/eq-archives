I can only assume that Mr. Talking Elbow is unmarried. Anyone should realize
that the only kind of marriage that would get broken over a game is the kind
that is already fractured and waiting for the final blow to shatter it. In this
case,
it happened in EQ. It might just as well have been some similar thing in real
life. When they end up in divorce court, I seriously doubt that you're going
to hear "Your honor, my wife lost my Phat Lewt and we now have
irreconcilable differences." Instead you're going to hear all of the real (and
imagined) reasons that led up to the feelings that were triggered by that
incident in EQ. It may have been the final straw, but the camel's
back had to have already been straining for it to signal the end of the marriage.

A little real-life perspective is good for everyone; spectators included.
