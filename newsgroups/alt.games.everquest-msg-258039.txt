(Why Auto attack on assist should always be off)

(just commenting in general, cause I'm too tired to sort out who said what.)

What it comes down to is this.  Leaving "attack on assist" on tends to
result in accidental mez breaks.   Often a tank will target a mezed mob and
taunt it before breaknig mez.   People who leave "attack on assist" on will
tend to break that mez before it's properly taunted, because they assist too
early.   Which tends to kill enchanters.

As a melee... you need to be pretty damn lazy to take that kind of a risk to
save one stinkin keystroke.

As a caster... you need to be pretty stupid to take that kind of a risk to
create an extra keystroke, turning attack off, since theres no reason you
would ever actually *want*  to have it on.
