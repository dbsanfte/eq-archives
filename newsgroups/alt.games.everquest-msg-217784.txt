    There are recommended levels on the items on the vendors. Looking at
them, you get some idea what the devs were thinking people would have in the
way of points at a given level. All I noticed is I wouldn't replace any of
the gear my mid-40's twinks have with anything under 200-odd points. At 7
points per adventure, that's a lot of adventuring.

    Having Vengeance II on a level 40 is just a matter of buying that ranged
slot item with Veng. II from LDoN in The Bazaar. Don't get me wrong, I think
it's great that they're trying to curb mudflation and encourage lower-level
folks to see the world rather than just do LDoN from level 20. But the LDoN
vendor items are No Drop, and stop twinking on their own. Having players
spend more time in LDoN ends up decreasing the flow of twink loot into the
Bazaar, and that is a good thing.
