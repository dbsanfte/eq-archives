I had an odd experience just the other day in FoB myself.  One of my alts is
a 19th level Iksar monk and he (I) was sitting there at the base of Kurn's tower
healing up.  In /ooc someone was discussing the bug in FoB where MoBs disappear
through the wall of the pit and then start hitting you from underneath.

Well, people were complaining about how Verant add tons of features but doesn't
fix old bugs and there wasn't much you could do.  All
true.  Some SK shouts, "spam Verant with bug reports over and over
till either they fix it or you're banned.  So you have about a 50%
chance of getting it fixed."  Ok, that's horrible logic, but some people
just aren't too smart.  Fine.

So I did an /ooc saying that there is a work-around for this bug.

Same SK shouts, "what, twink yourself like you?".  First of all, I'm not
a twink.  That's my main character on that server, and the only thing I have
that's at all unusual for a level 19 is a 2h bamboo bo stick that a kind player
once gave me.  So I say that everyhing except the bo stick I've earned on
my own.  Then he proceeds to give me some lip.   I stay silent and
say, "does anyone want to know the work-around or not?".  One guy responds
saying, "actually, I do".  So I do an /ooc explaining how to pull the mob out
of the pit and fight it there.  When the mob turns it can't and therefore
won't head into the wall.  Bozo then gives me more flak saying it won't work
and that my advice is stupid.  I further procede to say that if you're having
trouble killing it before it (rarely) reenters the pit, to pull it out
further first.  Result?  more flak.

I dunno.. maybe he was just having a bad day, but he certainly didn't make
a friend that day.
