This is DAOC...almost no chat channels.  In cities /broadcast is used for
auctioning and general chatter to keep the tradefolk from falling into a
boredom coma.  Outside cities you're pretty much shit outta luck if you want
to try to buy anything from players...heaven forbid you should want to SELL
something.  There's some sort of yell thing that I saw someone use to ask
for a group once...and to announce an invasion, though I haven't bothered to
figure out the command (kinda guessing it's /yell <g> ).  It's almost never
used.

So, in EQ, why NOT turn off ooc, shout and auction if you don't like inane
chatter, Lok?  It'd sound just like DAOC.
