Alan VanCouvering posted this small update for people who are noticing their
pets are a bit weak:
For those of you with characters that summon pets, we are aware of the
problem with pets. Currently they are not being summoned at their highest
level. Sorry for the problem, we'll get it fixed as soon as we can.
