My name is Graefaxe, err, Vic, and I am a 2-boxer also...

(Shut Up!  Whiner.)

Hey, you were nice to Dan...

(We like him)

Oh, I guess that explains things.

Anyway, this sounds like me.  I 2-box my Druid/Warrior or Druid/Ranger
combo, alone.  I would not inflict my 2-boxing on anyone else.  If I find
others that want to group, I log the least needed class off (unless they
know).  It is possible to keep up, I just don't feel comfortable doing it.
