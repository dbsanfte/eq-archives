The girl had way too much plat, apparently.  I was running through EC with 
my War, and I saw her auction "100pp for a stack of Heady Kiolas."  I 
jumped on that, knowing that I had 3 in the bank from the night before ( I 
was going to to a bunch of Wu's until I saw my horrible skill-up rate ).  I 
logged in Zym, and asked her how many she wanted total, and she said "How 
about 10 stacks to start?"

I was on that like ... well, you know.  After those 10, she wanted 10 more.  
Click click click click... but, well worth it.
