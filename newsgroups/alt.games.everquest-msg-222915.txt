I dont know.   On the one hand thunderous drum of karana did come down from
45k to 5k in just 2 months.  But on the other hand red dragon scale has been
10k for over a year since I first started checking on it.  I think it has
more to do with rate of normal drops than the bugged plat drop that people
are getting banned for exploiting.  BTW, can you get banned for buying plat
that was gotten from an exploit?  Not saying you will, just asking..
