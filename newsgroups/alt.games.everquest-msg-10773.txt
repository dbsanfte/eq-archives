If someone/something not in the zone or not a player does more than half the
damage or gets the killing blow then the corpse poofs.

Like guards killing things you attack.

Try getting your partner to nuke the guard when he is really low on hit
points to try get the killing blow.  If that doesnt work then you will need
to arrange it so he does more than half damage.
