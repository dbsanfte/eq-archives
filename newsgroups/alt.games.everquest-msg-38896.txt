I happened upon one of these on a lucky roll.  The options are that I'm
either going to keep it for my monk when I get around to playing him
again, or possibly sell it and donate the money charitably to the "Get a
Lammy for Jakugg" foundation.
  I looked at alakhazam, and they claim it's worth 3.7K.  EQprices.com
comes in at a whopping 7K. (Almost double. I personally think most of
these sites are completley useless for price information.)
   So how about it. Price check? Odds are I'll just hang on to it for my
monk, especially since I *hate* sitting in EC and auctioning, but I'd
like a realistic view of what that bad boy is worth on the current
market.
