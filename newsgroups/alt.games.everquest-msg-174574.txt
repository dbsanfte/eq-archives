He's level 43 and undead (nice for clerics/necros etc). I soloed him without
any real problem as a level 51 cleric. He's surrounded by "undead slaves"
(which con dark blue at 51, low 30s I'm told). The slaves drop a pickaxe
that sells to vendors for 7pp (lore, unfortunately). He himself drops
a number of decent items, mostly lore, which sell for between 5pp and
45pp to vendors or up to a hundred or so plat in the bazaar. There's a
vendor
just a couple of minutes away in Shadowhaven. It's not terribly difficult to
get to SH and back without aggroing anything.

However, the shissar organs seem to be a rare drop. I killed him about 6
times with no organ drops.

I have to say it's almost the ideal solo camp for a 51 cleric. All
undead; nothing aggros anything else; decent (not outstanding, but
decent) loot. There's enough of the slaves to keep even a KEI cleric
busy, I believe, though I was without KEI at the time.

The only real drawback is the extreme delay between shissar organ drops -
I'm guessing you would have to camp him for a solid day, if not more,
for enough organs to fulfil the Amulet of the Grey Wastes quest.
