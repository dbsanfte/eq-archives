Well he/she/it signs off with peaceout, princess.  So I adress 
he/she/it as princess.  I really don't care if he/she/it is a he/she 
or it.  And if princess doesn't imply gender when used by he/she/it it 
doesn't imply gender when I reply.  By the way those little "'s around 
the words "witty" "articulate" and "flame" in my response just might 
mean something.  You haven't been taken over by pod people have ya?
