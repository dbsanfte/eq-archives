According to some elaboration on the naming policies that I can't find a 
URL for now, something like "songsinger" is indeed acceptable, but 
encouraged to be used as a surname, rather than a first name.

For anybody having trouble coming up with an acceptable Fantasy name, I 
would suggest they give the Fantasy Name Generator two or three twirls, 
until it comes up with something better than lillliilllliiiiillililliil.
