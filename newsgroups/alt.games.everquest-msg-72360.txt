For the last few days I've been getting this error:

[Fri Dec 21 11:53:31 2001]00018:ERROR: Couldn't load eqmain.dll (error
1114)
[Fri Dec 21 11:53:31 2001]00019:ERROR: Couldn't execute Frontend
because dll_main is NULL

I've tried deleting eqmain.dll and eqgame.exe and repatching several
times to no avail.  I've uninstalled/deleted the entire eq directory a
couple of times and reinstalled with just the original version, patch
up, and it still happens :o

Anyone have any thoughts as to why this may be happening?  The support
forums aren't very helpful at all, as it seems to contain just "me
too" messages :P

ps. I'm running win2k, in case that may have any bearing.
