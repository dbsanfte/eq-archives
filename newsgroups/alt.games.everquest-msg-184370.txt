Err not wanting to contribute to the endless loop here but if you look
you will see at least half the zones are empty. Dont think anyone
would venture to say peeps are distributed evenly over there zones.
People tend to congregate in just a few zones, can think of about 20
off hand. Doesnt matter how many zones there are total they still end
up pretty much in the same zones. PoP would have been my guess for the
seeming emptyness of those zones but unless its tier 2 or higher no
more than 100 in pop zones most times. Maybe the new LoY zones? Hmm
could be...Any rate great for solo sucks for grouping now to level 55
at least. Would have given good money for this 2 years ago lol.
