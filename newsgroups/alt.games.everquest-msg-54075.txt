I dont give to beggers of any kind, but after having started a chanter ill
start giving money to newbie chanters that beg for it. DAMN those spell costs,
cost me over 100pp to get my level 8 and 12 spells. No newbie gonna get close
to that amouth of money at level 12.

Ah, random loot. I usually dont just give it out, but try to make some quest
the newbie have to do to get it. A lot more fun.
