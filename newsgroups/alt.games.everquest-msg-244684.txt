I think he's looking for something a bit different.  It's where your hot
button says, "Casting Somespell on %T" and "Somespell" is highlighted and a
link to the actual spell that someone could click like an item link.  I
tried to find the thread on Google groups but couldn't.  Hopefully a better
searcher or the thread author can post a link/reprint of the original post.
