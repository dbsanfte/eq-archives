How trivial are you talking, and what do you call high?  If you mean that
you are at a level in tailoring, for example, where something just went
trivial, then yes, you will still have a significant number of failures.  If
you are at, say, 100 in tailoring, and something trivials at, say 25, then
you should have very few failures, but you will still have some (on the
order of 1 in 40 or 50 maybe).  If you are at 26 in tailoring, and something
trivials at 25, then you will still see quite a few failures, it's kind of
stupid, but it's the way tradeskills work.  It used to be really stupid when
it would say:

You can no longer advance in skill by creating this item (whatever it says)
You lack the skill to combine these items (or whatever the exact text is)

They seem to have changed it so that when you fail you only get the second
message now.
