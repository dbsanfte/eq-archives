[ .. charm .. ]

I got a relatively simple view of charm: it irritates the hell out of me.
Many charmers do not announce what they have charmed. In addition, in areas
like velks, I sometimes am in groups battling 4 spiders at once or more,
that all sit on top of each other. I start slowing things and always have
to find out myself, that the spell didn't stick. Anf you never know if
your chanter is being attacked and dieing, or mezzing, or breaking charm
or whatever. All in all, in most groups charm does much more harm through
confusion than it helps. It *has* been a lifesaver in some ocassions
and direcharm is something else, but mostly, it's a bad thing in fast
pulling groups. At least to my experience.
