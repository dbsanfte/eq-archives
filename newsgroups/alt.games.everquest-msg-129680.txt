It isn't their homeland.  It is part of Isreal.  They may have inhabited the
area once, but they lost that right when they sided with Hitler.

Ah, personal attacks.  Out of facts already?

What's your point?  That Isreal held the land before the Palestinians were
there?  How does that change the fact that Isreal is the legal holder of
that land?  Or are you saying that Palestine shouldn't be forced to give up
the land they lost in war, and signed away?  Nah, treaties are useless
anyways, just listen to what the U.N. says, and it'll all be alright.

Probably because they have no sense of proportion.

Yeah, ok.  Sorry, but watching CNN, that doesn't quite play out.

Nope, read them.  Just because I think they're bull doesn't mean I didn't
read them.  Thank you for playing.

Read plenty, that's why I understand the situation, and you're just
regurgitating Zmag and amnesty.

Hmm.... Isreal cracks down, Suicide bombings stop.  U.S. tells Isreal to let
up, they do, suicide bombings continue.  Seems pretty clear to me.  If
Isreal wants peace, they're going to have to completely break the will of
the Palestinians.  Otherwise, any letting up on Isreals part will be taken
as a sign of weakness.

While

SB doens't wait for the Palistinans to stop to do this.  They are constantly
taking down terrorist leaders, usualy as a direct result of a terrorist
attack.  Now, are you suggesting that Isreal shouldn't take down those
responsible for attacking them?

There is no propaganda.  Unless you're accusing Isreal of attacking their
own people and blaming it on the Palestine, this makes not sense.
