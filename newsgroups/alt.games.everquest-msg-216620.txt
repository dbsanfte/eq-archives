Do kindly fuck off, and don't let the door hit your ass on the way out. I've
known Annie through the serverwide age channel for a little while now, and
she's one of the nicest people I've met in game. She may not be 'uber', but
she certainly does not lack in knowledge or (apparent) skill. I say
apparent, because I don't play on the same server as her.

As for the "you only a 46 pissing baby cleric" comment, let me reply with an
arrogant, holier-than-thou comment of my own. I've been playing since Beta
2; I've gotten several characters past 50, and even had a character at 50
when that was as high as the levels went. My current character is a 63
(almost 64) Enchanter, in an upper-end medium raiding guild. And you know
what? Level means absolutely jack shit in this game. I have met people in
their 40s who know more about this game then 20 level 65 players combined.
It's almost trivial to level once you get past the hump that begins at
around 40 and ends around the mid-50s. End result? You end up with idiots
who wipe groups because they don't know what the fuck they are doing.

I'm a bitter, cynical person. Ask anyone in the serverwide.age channel; I
get annoyed over trivial matters in my group, I tend to assume that people
can't play their classes until they're proven me otherwise. I also have a
somewhat arrogant attitude in my playing; I always take the path that "my
group will wipe unless I guide them down the road", unless I've either
played with you before or I know you through friends or guild rep. Yet even
I am willing to state that Annie (who I know as Tea) is a much more positive
contributor than you are, no matter what your former aliases were (unless
you were once Lokari, which I highly doubt, or jazz).

So kindly bugger off, will you? You're sucking up valuable bandwidth.
