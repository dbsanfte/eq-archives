On the noob isle I saw two people with purple names.  When I "examined" 
them, I found they were role-playing.  I did not seem to be able to 
communicate with either of them with /say or /tell.  (By the way, I'm on Tox 
server.)

Can I become a role-playing character on a non-role-playing server?  How? 
If so, does that mean that I can't talk with anyone other than other 
role-players?

Thanks in advance.

David
