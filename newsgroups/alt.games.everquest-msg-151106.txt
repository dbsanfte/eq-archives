Rogues and Warriosr are not meant to be solo classes.  They're both designed
to be team players.  In that respect, they're not broken by being unable to
solo.  Warriors need better, stronger taunts at all levels though--their #1
purpose is to be a brick wall/meat shield/call it what you will, and without
a superiour taunt, they're going to lag behind in that.
