There is a known issue with certain ram chips used on some of the 
Kingston memory sticks and ASUS AMD motherboards, perhaps with other MBs, 
and other memory vendors also.  I had a similar problem where I had to 
clock the FSB down a bit to make it work until Kingston replaced the 
memory free of charge with memory sticks that had different ram chips on 
them.  I now run with my FSB at full speed with no problems.

My sympton was that my machine would spuriously reset when running EQ for 
a short while when I had my FSB set to 400MHz, regardless of whether I 
was using dual channel mode or not.  I messed around with BIOS settings 
for a while, and found that clocking it down to 392MHz (or somewhere 
around there) solved the problem.  I contacted Kingston, they said it was 
a known issue with that particular combination of memory and motherboard, 
and shipped me replacement memory that corrected the problem.
