    Near as I can tell, any race can take any portal anywhere and be set
in a safe spot.  I have tested all the landing spots except for
Rivervale, and I've heard that that one is safe too.    The one in the
Overthere sets on the outside of the wall of the outpost, far enough
away from the the guardians as to not be an issue.
