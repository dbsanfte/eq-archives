I was just reading the thread about the crafting changes and whilst I dont 
agree at all with a lot of the comments (Seems to me that people simply want 
to be able to create everything without any hassle), I was interested to 
read about the various prices of rares etc across the many servers.

I am on the Neriak server and this is what I currently have to pay for 
rares:

T2 - Severed Bone - 3G
T2 - Silver - 10G
T3 - Paladium - 20G

Looking at some of the posts it seems this is very cheap, I was wondering 
how the other servers compare.

Also how much money do u have at your current level. I have one main 
character 22 Adv/30 Carpenter and I have around 1.5 Platinum. I believe this 
is a lot compared to non crafters on my server, but reading some of the 
posts on here about people spending 2p on rares, it doesnt seem like it's a 
lot on some other servers.

Also how are you guys making money. As a carpenter I mainly have to build 
boxes as this is pretty much the only thing I can sell. I do sell furniture 
now and again but thats only to rich people mainly. It's a real shame that 
the carpenter class isnt given better recipes as a lot of our furniture is 
poor compared to what you can buy and see around the world.

I must admit though I love the warped bone and fir beds :)
