Beastlords sometimes have issues with certain spells of lesser power
being cast on their pets by well-meaning buffers, which actually
overwrite and block our own spells which are better (or at least more
appropriate).  It's more of a problem now that there's the Pet Affinity
AA and so our pets can get, say, Bot9 when we would rather they have
Virtue (or whatever the new versions are).  Basically, when it happens,
we're left with no recourse but to dismiss and resummon and rebuff our
pet if we really want a specific buff on.

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
