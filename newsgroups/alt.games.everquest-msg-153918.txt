The Promised Land, an abermud like other abermuds, is on Betterbox at
telnet://promisedland.betterbox.net:6715 with our webpage at
http://promisedland.betterbox.net

In an alternate universe, a different promised land has emerged that has
become strickened by monsters, demons, sorcerors and dragons.  This land is
watched over by four dieties, who are all willingly to give you their
blessings and the ability to save the land.  And not surprisingly Moses
lives there.

Give us your sick, your tired, your weiry, where all have banished or
discriminated against you, we welcome you here...including all you AOL,
Finnish, and South Korean players...as long as you behave yourselves.

Promised Land features...

Four different "religions", where players can offer reaved souls, or their
treasures, in exchange for physical gifts.  Not every god can grant the same
gifts, but some gifts are invaluable.  Plus you don't have to stay with the
same one the whole game, or pick one at all.

Character creation is done at your own pace, not all at once.  When you are
ready you can visit the training centers, where you get any skill you need,
spells, strength building, and healing rates.  What you learn may determine
what you become...a warrior, thief, mage, or priest.  The most important
training center...the orientation tour, teaches you how to handle yourself
in the early goings and gives you the necessary starter equipment.  Our
friendly receptionist will give you some early valuable advice.  Learn the
secret of ethereal, it may save you some time in your quest.

A total of 67 hardcoded quests, each with a defined goal--some are easy,
some are difficult, but there's a quest for players of any level.  During
your entire run, you must find the twenty lost volumes of knowledge--guarded
by various foes.  We also have fun & games, hide&seek, bounty hunts, trivia,
capture the flag, poker quests--find five cards and make the best hand for a
prize, and scrabble quests--find enough tiles to make a high-scoring word.

There's bodypart fighting, where if you're not careful, you can lose your
limbs, but if you lose your neck, you're finished!  (But the dieties can
grant you protection from this if you give them an offer they won't
refuse...)  But keep yourself in top physical condition by visiting the
hospital regularly.

Unlike most Dikus, all fights with monsters are fair...no monsters exist
that do 500 damage to a mortal on one blow here.  Those that aren't...well,
you aren't supposed to fight them anyway--but if you're tough enough, go
ahead!  But unlike most Abers, mobiles regain strength and some may run from
you!  If you want to fight a player instead, you can challenge them, or
fight it out inside the arena.  Every so often, we'll have a playerkill
tournament--spend your money and offer your souls to build a winning tourney
fighter...or if you want to watch them fight it out...we have a grandstand
area complete with a sports broadcaster calling play by play.  Team
deathmatch is also possible with up to ten teams attempting to take all the
enemy flags.

Unlike most Dikus where you need billions of points, the number of points
needed to become immortal is 500,000.  And even after you immort, you can
remort to run some more, and challenge the evil Black Knight!  And if your
first run to wizard is too easy, you can do it again under famed mode
(hard), or great mode (hardest), and even a levelless mode with a
combination of the difficulty modes (hard to near impossible!)

Don't miss out on a different kind of mudding experience, Promised Land on
our site at http://promisedland.betterbox.net for the website and Java
telnet, or with a telnet client in color:
telnet://promisedland.betterbox.net:6715

"Hey I went one time and there wasn't anyone there!"  Well, it doesn't occur
very often these days but there is an INFO file so you can see who's been
there lately that's level three or greater--INFO PLAYERS.
