I don't know the wizards personally, I have a friend in a guild with a
number of MB wizards, and the starting point for damage at full mana that he
told me was 4 to 4.5k.  Not counting +mana gear, a level 60 wizard with 255
int has a bit under 3k mana.  As I understand it, MB does 1.5 to 2 x mana
pool in damage?  If that is the case, then average would likely be 1.75xmana
pool?  If so, for 7.5k average damage, not counting crits, that is 1400 to
1500 of +mana gear.  If you are counting crits because with 5 wizards, the
liklihood is high enough, then that reduces the mana pool requirement.  I
admit to being pretty hazy on the details of Manaburn.  I tried to find info
at various places, but the info seemed to vary quite a bit.
