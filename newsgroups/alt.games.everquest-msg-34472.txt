As a side note, I was kind of wondering how this quest was supposed to work
vs the way it works. Near as I can figure out The Hermit is an Unkept Druid
and he wants Shoontar's head to give up the flute.

I couldn't figure out a way into the locked hut or any other method of
getting him outside besides killing him. Makes giving him Shoontar's head
kind of tough. => Busted quest?
