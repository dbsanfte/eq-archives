I quite like the music in EQ when you get the loading screen.  I don't have
any of the expansion packs, so it may be different for other people but it
is the music when it loads a different area - when you get the picture of a
knight in foreground and a female elf firing an arrow wearing a green
costume.

It's kinda cheesy but very chirpy, and is not on the install CD or in the
installation folder...
