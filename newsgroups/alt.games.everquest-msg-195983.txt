None of the server names in the poll really jumped out at me.

I played an Iksar there for a few hours Saturday night. The highest 
non-anons on line at that time were in their low 20s -- and all of 
them in Paludal, of course. I bet that was a zoo. Saw very few 
druids in the /who lists I ran, but I bet they were most all 
anon to fend off the SoW begging.

I hunted exclusively in LoIO, which hovered around a dozen people
in zone, all very well behaved. Most all there were necros and 
a few shaman/monk pairs. No surprises there. FoB, on the other hand 
had about 90 people in it and no shortage of obnoxious shouting.
No surprise there either.

Was fun for one night, doubt I'll go back though.
