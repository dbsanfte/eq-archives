The 20% reduction in number of attacks is independant of whether the mob 
is slowed, if the mob is unslowed and attacking 80 times a minute its 
only going to attack 64 times per minute (on average) with stunning pet, 
if its slowed 75% so its attacking 20 times per minute with the stuns 
its only going to attack 16 times per minute.

What it doesn't do is stack cleanly with other stunners; a second 
stunner won't reduce attacks by an additional 20%, since 20% of the time 
his stuns will land while the mob is already stunned (or vice versa), so 
he'll only see a 16% reduction... thats still 36% reduction though.  Add 
a third pet and you only see 12.8% reduction from him, thats 48.8% fewer 
attacks though... still amazing stuff when you think about it.

Splendid
