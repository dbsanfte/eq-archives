Civilly explaining things to new players and people who don't know any
better is practically every player's duty; I don't know where I'd be
without the encyclopaedic advice I've received in my adventures. It's
just when people who really should know better by now (50+) have to have
their hand held then it's time to sob with despair.

Experienced players playing alts can be spotted a mile away, and not
just by their exotic gear. The best form of twinking is knowledge.
