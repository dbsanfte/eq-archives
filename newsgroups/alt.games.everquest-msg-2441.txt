When did you crawl out from the cave you've apparently been living in?
Gems has been the subject of heated debate in this NG since it was first
announced. Yes, it is a generally known fact, so you didn't really
discover anything, sorry. It is also the only game of its kind right
now. Sorry for the seemingly callous response, I'm just getting tired of
seeing the same questions in here over and over again, and no longer
have any patience to spare.
