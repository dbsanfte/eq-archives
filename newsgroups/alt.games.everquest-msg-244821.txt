/nod.   The guild I considered joining after I quit hardcore raiding did it
that way.  Although I did generally check spawns even when they were not
going to be raiding, so that I could keep track on what was killed when, and
would know what might be up on raid nights.   (and because I just loved
sneaking around on my rogue into places where I wasn't supposed to be ;)  )

Thats not quite the type of guild we were discussing in this thread though.
