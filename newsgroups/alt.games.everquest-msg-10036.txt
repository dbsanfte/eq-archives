No, because I don't see it as a problem. Brewing is a skill in the game, right?
And a skill in real life. I think that even following the best instructions I
could locate, I made at least a half dozen batches of near poison before I got
one single all grain beer to come out remotely drinkable.
  Sewing (tailoring) is a skill in EQ and IRL.  I had to learn some sewing for
costume work.  I saved a few of my early efforts at making an extremely simple
medieval tunic that requires one pattern outline and two pieces of material,
using a very nice, user friendly modern sewing machine.  Not pretty, my friend.
Not a sight for the weak of stomache.
  Your skills and results *should* suck for a long time, and you *should* have
to practice over and over again before you can even become passable at something
requiring great skill.   And far, far longer to remotely approach becoming a
"master".
  Jewelry? Ask a RL jeweler some time how long the education and apprenticeship
lasts before they will even consider letting you get your hands on a high
quality diamond with some cutting tools in your hand.
