i THOUGHT i had finished my Wheel staff quest for my friends account
when.... i go to combine them all in the box and oneof the shows up a
"a scepter" looks the same as "a rod" except its magic as well as no drop
and no lore. also necros use it. so how do i tell what part im missing? and
idea where i picked up the necro scepter?
