No, random statistical noise is the one day's parse where I had a jaw
dropping 23% fail rate.  =)  These parses are over days and days of play.

~5 seconds for me, with full AAs.  I can feign twice before a CH will hit. 
And as much as I enjoy the "control" parses, like the punching dummies, I
much prefer the results of "real world" parsing when they can be considered
to be at least mostly accurate.  Things like movement, mob aggro, etc.
*might* have an impact (there is a rare and seemingly random feign fail
message due to moving even).

I don't have the proper logs to parse it, but sometimes I get a real sneaky
feeling that I failed feign less at 199 skill than at 200.   =)
