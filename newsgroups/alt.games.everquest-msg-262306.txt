Bard of 5 1/2 years here.  What will this mean to me?  well, if I solo, my
usual slow but steady method is to DoT kite a single mob about.  this will
now mean all I have to do is worry about the circle I run in.  Umm... yay?

In a group, standard is to twist songs 2 to 5, with 1 being amplification, a
focus song.  Can get by without it.  So I can then just spart up /melody and
chat away, stopping the twist when I toddle off (at selos speed btw) to
pull.

All of that takes pressure off my wrist.  That's the good part.  The bad
part is that most of that will also be able to be done while I control a
toon on another account.  First thing that comes to mind?  Shaman on a 2nd
acct root rotting a mob while I have the bard /melody twisting 5 DoT's on
the same mob.

Alternatively, I set the bard up to /melody twist manasong and resists on
raids, and just /follow a cleric, or enchanter for events like Rathe
Council.

Dont get me wrong, it has a lot of good points.  But te big risk is that
Bardbots will become the flavor of the month, and will diminish the desire
people will have for the class.  Will also make it harder for those of us
who genuinely work hard to learn as much about the class as possible.
