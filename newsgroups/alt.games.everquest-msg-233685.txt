Owie! He wants to plonk me! I'm telling Mom!

Here, let me help you plonk me, since you're too fscking slackjawed to 
figure it out for yourself. Take the training wheels off and download 
yourself a *real* newsreader like Agent or Gravity - NOT Outlook - 
install it, use it, plonk to your heart's content. I won't even morph so 
that once in the Bozo Bin I'll stay there. See how considerate I am?

Or maybe you can't because your employer is firewalling traffic on NNTP 
ports. Hmmm, maybe they don't want you to be reading alt.gay.teens at 
work.

In that case, use this link:

<http://groups.google.com/advanced_group_search?dq=&num=25
&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&group=alt.games.everquest&safe=off>

and stick my name in the field marked "WITHOUT the words". Then bookmark 
the results of the search.

Now, not only will you have plonked me, but every article that even 
references me or replies to me.

That's your one and only free lesson, n00b. Now get back to work.

Hah, is this you trying to claim spank on me, n00b? Good one, 
Candypants. That smarts.
