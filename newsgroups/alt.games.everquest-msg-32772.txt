I've played with enchanters a lot.  The 31 (now 32) cleric isn't my
main, a 45 druid is and he's spent most of his life in a more or less
permanent group, one of whose members is an enchanter.  But in the
case that provoked the post, we only had an enchanter briefly.  Yes,
with an enchanter or a bard in the group, my comments do not apply.

Since we were quite often fighting things yellow to the tanks, who
were lower level than me, I had my hands pretty full healing, although
I'd root whenever I could.  For a while we had a druid who was quite
good at root parking and that also worked.

I don't know if this is so, but it certainly *seems* as though the
druid root is a bit more effective than the normal root....
