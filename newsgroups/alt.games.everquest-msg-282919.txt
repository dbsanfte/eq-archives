Heh, I've never done that with Gate potions -- wasn't willing to
spend that sort of plat when all of my characters can either cast
Gate themselves, or get a No Rent gate potion from their in-game
guildmaster. :-)  But I definitely used the sellback value to
mitigate the cost of SOW potions.

But I've definitely been bitten by the other end of it, where
someone would offer to sell me a multi-dose potion without telling
me it had only a few doses left.  Caveat emptor!
