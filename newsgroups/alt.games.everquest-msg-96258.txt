After a particularly bad session of EQ last night (two characters lost
levels), I found myself dead at the feet of a summoning MoB for the
first time in my EQ career.  I've fought in groups in the past against
such creatures but never have been summoned myself and I found I didn't
have any idea what to do.

I was in Fungus Grove outpost and thought I'd peak over the edge of the
rise into the cavern to see what I could see.  I had Superior Camo on,
but failed to notice the 'you are about to appear' message until a spell
casting graphic appeared in the darkness to my left.  Something named a
deadly ebon lotus (or something similar) cast a cold based DD on me.  I
thought I break for the outpost or at least back off enough to consider
what to do.  When I got out of the creatures sight, of course, I was
summoned to him.  I ran again to gain distance to regroup, and was
summoned when out of sight.  Long story short, I'm dead at the feet of
the lotus having lost level 51.

My question is this - Can you back off out of melee range and cast
against a summoning creature?  He only seemed to summon me when out of
sight but not out of melee range (but that could be coincidence I
guess).  Or does it work differently for static summoning creatures
versus mobile summoning creatures?

Fortunately it only took four Frost Giant Elites to regain my level (all
guild clerics online were on a raid of course, so no res for the druid
;).

Thanks in advance,

Moriarty
