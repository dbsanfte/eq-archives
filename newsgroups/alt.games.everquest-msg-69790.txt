*If* swimming skill affects drowning time, it would be *only* if you're
a leezard. No way yet to quickly check that, but we've at least been
able to show that it doesn't affect the drown time of the other races.
Now we just need to find an Iksar who's *never* improved their swim
skill over the course of their life and one who has, of the same levels,
and drown them to see.

Of course, I'm always up for drowning Iksars, even if we don't bother
timing it. ;-)
