Well I'd be a barb shaman, because they can be full neutral. When you
are neutral you can cast and be cast upon by everyone. Evil can't be
cast on by good nor good by evil. Neutral also receives no benefit or
subtraction to xp for grouping with anyone, nor does anyone receive a
bonus or subtraction for grouping with the neutral. Other alignments
may receive bonuses or subtractions. I've not even got it straight if
a discordant neutral and and ordered neutral would not receive a
subtraction, but I know a Full Neutral receives neither since verant
said so. They did not really clarify though if variations of neutral
did.

But barb shaman can definately be Neutral all by itself, as can druids
and most non diety non evil races/characters.  

Halfling rogue can be Neutral.

High elf casters can be 
(OG - ON/NG) (high elves in general.. besides casters too)

so they can only be goods or Ordered Neutral.

I still don't get it but under the description of ON it suggests they
would not be with those who follow discord? So maybe they can cast on
them but would receive an xp penalty? This is not really that well
explained by verant.

Ah a post in here further clarifies:

http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000332.html

Snippet:

" I am assuming the modifier is based on the perspective of each
character. In the above axample, the N would get his 25% of the exp
(plus a little for the group size bonus), the DN would get a bonus for
being with another D the (DG) and a penality for being with a O (OG)
so they would pretty much cancel each other out and would get his 25%
of the exp, the OG would get a bonus for the DG but get a negative for
the DG and DN (discordant penality) and would thus get a bit less than
25% of the exp - say around 24% with getting into number details. The
last member (the DG) would get one bonus and one penality and would
end up with 25% of the exp. Overall the group as a whole would lose
just a fraction of exp. "

".....Yes, your four Orderly Good clerics would receive a reasonable
experience bonus. But adding a Discordant warrior of some sort won't
destroy their experience gain. Though it might be true that the
warrior might be hard pressed to pay attention to his fighting with
all those clerics pestering him about his hygiene or his moral
standardsï¿½

So I guess even the ordered neutral high elf caster could group with
variations of good or neutral like the alignments in the message board
example, or variations of neutral and evil. An evil could not group
with the people above and be cast on all of them even if it could even
group with them since there are some goods. If the group had some
evils a good who came along could not group apparently or have them
cast on it. They've still not said how this will occur in an already
established group.

Ah and here in that same link absor indeed clarifies that only Neutral
"N" has the best advantage of no minus (but no plus either) always:

"Neutral in that case means only the alignment of neutral. That's why
I expanded upon the good and evil thing in the first point and not in
the case of the no experience bonus part. Yes, only neutrals (N) have
the bonus/restriction of neither causing an experience penalty or
bonus for alignment. Other grouping bonuses apply as the normally
would.

Alan"


OH and here is the main thing, missed this before:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alignment interactions
- Goods and evils (anyone with a G or an E in their alignment) can not
group with or cast beneficial spells on each other.
- All others can group with each other. However, there will be
experience bonuses and penalties based on the compatibility of the
others in your group with your own alignment. So if you are a
disorderly fellow and you plan to group with some followers of order,
expect an experience penalty. Their incessant tidiness and
organization will make it difficult for you to keep your attention on
your personal improvement.
- Neutrals do not gain a bonus or penalty for grouping, nor to they
give a penalty or bonus to those they group with.
- The total penalty for any group can never be greater than the
experience bonus given for group size. Generally any penalties for
alignment will be less than the grouping bonus.

These experience modifiers are intended to encourage grouping among
people of similar desires without being too restrictive. Hopefully
we've hit the fine balance needed to make that happen. Please keep us
informed as to your opinions on this implementation."


He still does not really clarify how the group thing is done, like if
you have a DN or an N and then a DG I guess even one G means the group
is "good" so when they try to group an evil it says they can't and I
guess the reverse would be true also.

Of caster races eruds can only be (ON/OG/NG)
High elves (OG - ON/NG)
gnomes (N/DN/NG/NE/DG/DE)
human  (ANY)
iksar (OE - NE)
Dark elf (OE/NE - DE)
 
(assuming you mean int casters)

So of those only the Human and Gnome can be Neutral
(though for either being a necro would mean evil:
(DE - NE/OE) )
and group with all receiving no bonus or penalty to xp (except
whatever normal one they'd get for number of people in group)

High elf and Erud could be Ordered Neutral and group with anyone evil,
good or neutral but would receive bonus/penalty if they were/not order
or order N I guess. So yeah, high elf would be okay if you made sure
to do /alignment and pick the number for ordered neutral at 10 (you
are probably a good one by default)

Iksar and dark elf can only be evil.
