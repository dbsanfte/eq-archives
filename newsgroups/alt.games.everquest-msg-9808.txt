Much of the "public" information available on the
web has no business being
public in the first place; there have been cases
(not yet a lot) where folks have
been prosecuted for obtaining information through
questionable, if not illegal,
means and making it public. In addition, it is
very, very easy to get information
on the wrong person or to create and disseminate
distortions and out right lies.
How many Ron A. Greens do you suppose there are in
the United States? I can do a
web based White Pages search and find hundreds,
not counting the many, many, MANY
variations such as Ronald Green or R. A. Green or
Ron Albert Green. Which one is
Bizbee? My own White Pages search shows up three
different addresses. Which one
is my current address and phone number? (Actually,
none of them; I'm unpublished
and have been for years.) This is not the person
referenced being stupid, but the
person who is attempting to provide the
information as accurate and directly
relating to the person in question being stupid.

And under Washington State law at least, providing
even public information with
the intent to harass or defame (such as appears to
be melon head's desire) is a
class 1 misdemeanor and subject to a year in state
prison. I refer you to a very
recent case working its way through the courts,
where an individual had set up a
web site providing such "public" information as
the names, home addresses, home
telephone numbers, vehicle licence numbers and
descriptions, social security
numbers, current pay rates and current shift
information on entire police
departments and the guard roster of a local state
prison.
