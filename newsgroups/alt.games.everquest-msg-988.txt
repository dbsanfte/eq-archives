Of course it was. It was part of the overall. You know the comperhensive... The
forest rather  than the trees?  You know... conceptual - intuitive rather than
linear - literal. aka anal retentive?

>I realize that reading comprehension is hard, but we were discussing

Actually only for some is it *hard*. For others not so much. Please see the
previous paragraph.  TO belabor the  point...  *irresponsible healer* is only a
sub set of the the overall subject of guess what?  Yesssss!! Irresponsible
group members!!!!!!!!!!!  But I guess you are correct comprehension is almost
as difficult a quality as is try to understand things in context.

Have a wonderful anal sort of day.
