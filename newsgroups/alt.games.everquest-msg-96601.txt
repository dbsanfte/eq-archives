>The hell levels and splat levels are
>getting wiped.

Removing "hell levels'" is a *GOOD* thing as long as the same total
exp is required to get to level 60. Nothing sucks worse than not
seeing the exp bar move in a hell level, and knowing it will get worse
the next time. Sure it's a perception thing, but taking the "road"
bumps out of leveling, and keeping the road between 1 and 60 the same
length changes nothing over-all.

Just the other day I had to help re-equip a friend that lost
everything due to newbie corspe rot for the third time. He only lost
some cloth armor, and a rusty weapon, but he was ready to quit over
the frustration. How many of us had to delete and re-roll our first
characters due to lost corpses when we were newbs? I bet the
percentage is very high. 

>And yes, the spell book is going away. 

About friggin time!!!!

The worst part of the "book" is the change in screen resolution
(Full-->Windowed). It is extremely annoying, especially when you set
your chat colors to work with the semi-transparent background, and
they are unreadable in Windowed Mode.

A fair compromise would be to have a "book" graphic move up and
patially or completely block the "Full-Screen" view until level 35. It
would add to the realism to see a caster lift a book and hold it in
front of them, and would still retain the "right of passage"
associated with hitting level 35.

These changes are huge, but not that significant. It reminds me of the
whining and bitching you heard from high-level hybrids when the EXP
penalty was removed. They felt that everyone else should suffer just
like they did, when any objective person could see that the hybrid-exp
penalty was a crock from day 1.
