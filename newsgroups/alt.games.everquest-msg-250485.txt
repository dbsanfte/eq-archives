Once you are high enough to LDOn, money starts to come in quickly. Also the giants in Rathe Mts drop
plat out the butt. Lvl 30 or so there, if you can find a gorup. They also drop fine steel weapons,
which sell for decient plat. Also as a necro. you can make a fortune with dead man floating. Peeps
who need to go in water will pay out the rear for the 1.5 hour time they dont need to surface for
oxygen. another good source of plat is the crushbone belts and shoulder pads in g fay and crushbone.
high of 5 plat each for them. They also help build faction in kaladim, so evil races/classes need
them for this.
