OK, valid point.  However, given the general tone and language of this
newsgroup, I'm not so sure that referring to baseless account bannings
as gestapo tactics in and of itself invalidated the entire post.  If
this were alt.cuddly.fluffy-bunnies, maybe, but this is a rather rough
and tumble place, where generally a single word doesn't negate an
otherwise reasonable post.  But maybe everything has gone all
fuckwilly and I didn't notice.
