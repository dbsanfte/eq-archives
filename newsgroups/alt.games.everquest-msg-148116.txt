That's because it is one of THE best xp grinding zones
around...although I have to admit I haven't been in since the
xp-per-mob changes.  For a long time it was a decent place
to grind out an AA level per session with a paladin/rogue (me)/
cleric/monk group, with almost no risk and decent loot for
grinding.
