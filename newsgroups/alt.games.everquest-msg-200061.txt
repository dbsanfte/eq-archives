Neither (unless you are a Gnome!). They are produced by players, Gnome
Tinkerers to be specific, and are therefore easiest purchased in the Bazaar.
Seraching on "Geerlok" should produce a list.

Yes. Each has the appropriate 5% modifier.

You equip them in the primary slot, don't put them in a container! So
nothing to return, and never disappears :)

Don't forget they only affect SUCCESS, not likelyhood of SKILLUP.

Yes, and No! Once you pass level 50, you can invest one or more AA points in
Tanaan Crafting Mastery (or something like that), each point invested allows
you to take another tradeskill past 200. There are several players who have
7 skills at 250 (actually some class/race combos can get more than 7, but I
don't recall hearing of anyone who has more than 7 at 250 yet).

No idea, sorry - sure someone else will have an opinion ;)
It was an easy choice as a Ranger - Fletching 250 :)
