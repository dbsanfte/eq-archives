   Aw.  I was rooting for you, too.  

   The age issue isn't the only number I wonder about in these "facts".  I
wonder what poor sap (teehee) they had on tree counting duty.  On the number of
characters created, are they also counting those on accounts that have been
inactive for 4 years?  And as has been pointed out before, Norrath and plains
don't really seem to be a big as they say it is.
