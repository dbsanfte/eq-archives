Making ornate is a no-fail combine but I'm pretty sure you have to be
lvl 55 to get one piece from a quest NPC that you need for the
combine. 

Also, if you're thinking about it for your cleric, the plate boots
mold tends to be a lot more expensive than the leather ones. Kinda
like the chain version; I looked for about 2 months w/o seeing one in
the bazaar. Probably still wouldn't have it if a friend of mine hadn't
given me the mold out of the blue.
