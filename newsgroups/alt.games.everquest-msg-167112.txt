Killfiles are for the weak. :)

}I disagree.

Well, you say that here...

}The exchanges with BS, are not an attempt at

But this seems almost like an agreement. :)

}>Not that it's important, really.  But I disagree with Taras on principle.

}Thats because you are a dense piece of shit barely
}capable of understanding the written word :-P ;-)
}8-)..etc,etc..

Dat's cuz I wented to publec skool.

}>Yup, and humans survived without motorcars, computers, nylon, and EQ for

}Ok.. I'm with you. We'll call it Year One

Would you have caught the sarcasm if I'd used a smiley? :)

}>See?  Can't get much more pompous than Derrida.
}You ain't seen nothing yet.

Of course not, nothing is invisible, therefore, you can't see it...

}>Ah, this is the part of the flamewar where both
}> sides declare victory
}Both?

Yeah, it's tradition.  Both sides declare victory, even though both lost.  
Get on with it.

}>It's a small world.
}I wouldn't want to paint it, though.

Like we could ever agree on a color...
