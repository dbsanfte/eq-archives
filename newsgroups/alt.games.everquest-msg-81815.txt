My pally is currently lvl 22 and I would like to go on a good quest with
her. What are some good quests to do? I guess some background info would be
helpful. She is a paladin of Truth out of Freeport. She is half elf.
Worships Mithaniel Marr ... not sure what else is needed. Anyways, some
advice on a good quest would be most appreciated.

Thanks in advance.
