  I agree, though I doubt EverQuest ever run "as well" on a P166 as it did
on a Pentium III 800. :)  There has always been a good deal of room for
improvement in framerate with my Pentium II 350.

  I agree here too, but this is essentially what they've done.  I don't
think they have upped the requirements for anything (except operating
system/DX version) unless you buy and install Luclin.  Adding the new Kerran
models/textures to the global file has made the game a bit more demanding on
older systems, but is the new engine all that much more demanding than the
old one?  I don't know, because I'm still using Windows 95 at the moment and
haven't been able to test it.  But when I do upgrade to Windows 98 and
DX8.1, if performance is significantly worse, then that indeed will be
disappointing, especially given the fact I will have spent $90 upgrading my
system to enjoy very little new content and even worse performance.

  They didn't alienate me as a loyal player by upping the requirements...
that I can handle if I am at least getting something good in exchange.  What
they did to alienate me was rush Luclin, rush the new engine and thus not
give us ANY warning that our systems would no longer be supported.
