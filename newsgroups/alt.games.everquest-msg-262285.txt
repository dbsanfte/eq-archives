After reading a number of posts in this thread I'll just add my 2 cents.  I 
have a 66 enc that's been forced to charm stuff (I hate charming) in Vxed & 
Tipt along with other places.

TD3 + 300 CHA doesn't necessarily mean the charm will last all that long. 
Most of the time it breaks inside a minute still.  But that's somewhat 
off-topic.

Anyway.  I don't think it's a nerf.  I think it's UNFORTUNATE but I've long 
thought that being the #1 DPSer (by FAR) was a silly role for an enchanter.
