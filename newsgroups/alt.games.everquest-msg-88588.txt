Rumor is the next expansion is made by the guy who was doing
"Furcadia" and is a furry mud offshoot, hence them testing Vah shir in
EQ to see how people like furries with "OK SIZED FUZRY BREATS!" Soon
we will all be sitting and spinning on couch cushions in a furry mud.

Not really, but if you ever played furcadia.. you do get kind of a
laugh when you go into the vah shir palace and some of the kitties are
sitting on oversized cushion looking things.
