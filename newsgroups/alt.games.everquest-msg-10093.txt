Verant may have been listening to customer feedback.

Many players, or groups of players were endlessly 'farming' rare items for
the sole purpose of selling them in RL. This behavior was making it
difficult for other players to acquire the items for personal use.

I understand your anger at not being able to make money from a video game.
Wait a minute, actually, I don't. Get a job.
