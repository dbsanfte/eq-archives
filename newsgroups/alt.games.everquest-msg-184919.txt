It's a wrestling quote ... at one of the WWE King of the Ring PPVs, Stone
Cold Steve Austin won the tournament. This was back when people held up the
huge "John 3:16" signs during sporting events, apparently wrestling counted.

The quote is what Austin said after winning and asked how he felt. The
phrase "Austin 3:16" has held on ever since.

Probably more than you ever wanted to know, but what can I say, I like
wrestling.
