Thanks, your guidance helped me make it as far as Nek before things got
hairy. Lost a spirit shard in the citadel...ran right between the
guards thinking that it was leading me to the docks. When I went back
it was clearly not worth it. Since this is an alt I can wait 3 days to
reabsorb.

It's good to be in Qeynos, some people over there play evil characters
for a reason...I got bad advice from two players who wanted to see me
die and even one shouted that he hoped an owlbear would eat my brains.
