Well, nothing, I search using the bazaar search not browsing the 300+
traders then I locate them by using the same so providing I can click on you
standing on a barrel does nothing, except maybe easier for me too see you.

One thing you could try is the Spiny weapon trick, get a couple, drop one
stand on it, drop another, stand on it, pick up the first drop it etc.
Of course in the bazaar the chances of a dropped weapon staying dropped are
remote.
Why get up to the roof anyway, if you're up there, no one can buy off you?
