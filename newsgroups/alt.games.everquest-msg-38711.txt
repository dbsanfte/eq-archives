This reminds me of something kind of funny. A foreign guy in my guild

dervs so for some really stupid reason he honestly got it in his head
that if you kill dervs it WON'T spawn. Then a friend was twinking a
low char of someone else in the guild on dervs and he was yelling at
them and saying the are mean to people in our guild and all this crap.
I and everyone tried to explain it calmly to him about 12 times, but
he would not get it through his head. He still thought that if you
killed dervs the AC WON'T spawn ever.

We basically kicked that guy to the curb since he continually caused
problems like the above with people fighting in the guild just because
he did not understand exactly what was being said in English even when
we told him over and over.
