I can empathize with your situation, as I've made the same mistake at
Fletching - just nowhere near as costly.  About 50pp in arrow supplies went
into producing 5 arrows.  Worse than the money, I now had to cross 2 hostile
zones to get back to fletcher's shop to restock, and my time playing that
day went from adventuring to making arrows.  2 Lessons learned that day:
CTRL not SHIFT, and make yer friggin arrows in front of the friggin
fletcher.

I would disagree somewhat with your last analogy though.  True a Cleric
cannot equip a Wurmy, but nothing stops him from buying it, or questing for
it.  At the young age of  6th Lvl I bought something called a Crushbone Belt
from a vendor.  Cost me most of the silver I has saved to that point. When I
tried to put it on, I was told that I couldn't (some baloney about Race,
Class, or Religion keeping me from wearing it) so I sold it back. IF I knew
then what I know now =)...ah well...

The mechanics of the software probably will keep a cleric from ever being
able to equip a Wurmy and then being told he can't engage in melee with it
because he doesn't know how to...but I would think it would be possible to
include stacks of a valid recipe (or even just extra items within a valid
recipe) as 'Not Combinable'.  Baby steps.  It wasn't too long ago that
spider silks and most pelts became stackable (I'd have thought that would
have been an obvious change two years ago).  I would bet that if enough
trade skill workers kept asking for it, they might see this change.
