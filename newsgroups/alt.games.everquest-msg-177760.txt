Gore would rip him a new asshole. Easily.

Maybe Tal would be a more realistic opponent, but im not sure a solo warrior
could really do that either...

I can think of lesser mobs who would absolutely destroy him too (VS)

Also, by solo do you mean toally unaided?  As in.. no buffs either?  Cuz his
HP would be a lot less than 10k in that case
