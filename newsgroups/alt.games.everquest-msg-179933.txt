Even if she's still up, Ivandyr's Hoop was a rare drop. The estimate of
every twenty is low per what I've heard. I've heard of some who claim 1 in
100. The problem may be that most can't afford the 20 rubies to try 20
straight times, as it seems to be a counter rather than random.
Also, Lynuga was not all that easy to find and was AWOL often.
