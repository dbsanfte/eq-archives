One on one it really depends alot on the MR of the person the enchanter is
fighting.  If you are wearing MR gear (a very popular item for a play to
loot off a vanquished foe's corpse) then yes, you can really screw an
enchanter up fast since virtually all enchanter spells are magic based.
But, not all pks wear resist gear, and those that do are often wearing
resist gear at the expense of excellent PvE gear, so it all balances out in
a way.

I haven't tested this to be certain, but I'll lay odds that that effect is
easily dispelled with a pillage enchantment, which does I'll admit eat up
precious time, but still.  Necros and sk's, however, can put dots on that
aren't dispellable, disease or poison based.  This is much more difficult to
overcome.  As I noted, Necros aren't my favorite opponent, not at all..
