 I was wondering about that, since it wasn't mentioned. A good change in
my opinion. I can't tell how many times I've had that damn effect
resisted simply because the mob was snare resistant.

 XP nerf is a bit lame in my opinion. The thing to do was make it so
that group xp increased, therefore making it more desireable to group
for xp while still providing the same xp people used to receive when
resorting to soloing.
