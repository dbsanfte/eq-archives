I'm easy myself. I've done loot splitting by more methods than I can
imagine, however...

When I played text based muds we'd have hours long PGL's (PowerGroup:Loot)
where we'd have 50 people in the group, but pick up, oh, four hundred items
of various levels of worth. So we'd all roll, put people in order based on
roll, and first gets first pick, etc, etc, etc, ad naseum. And we'd just
keep going through the column.
It became so common place they added a special room, with a 'bot' that took
care of the whole mess for the leader. Leader gives all items in bags, all
bags gets handed back. Gives any bags that are part of the loot back empty,
they get added to list. Leader assigns any roll bonuses (main tank, or
someone who did an exceptional job) and the bot forces everyone in the group
to roll, sorts em, then starts down the list. Anyone can look at the items
at any time without bothering others (id's cost 500 gold, but I would spend
that on bread in a day, and my character didn't need to eat anymore (and
consequently, could eat as much as he wanted)) Each person can pick an item,
or pass.
You could even go do other things while loot was cycling, and it would tell
you when your turn was in 5 picks and offer you a recall to the room.
Finally, once everyone passed or had left group, it would dump everything on
the room floor, where it was ffa, and would disolve in about 10 min.
