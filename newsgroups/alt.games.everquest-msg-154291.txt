Depends on what the context I think.  I read it as that they though
all content should be tuned for small groups.

If one is just talking about getting a group together to just kill
stuff for fun, there's plenty of places that are tuned for just that
kind of fight.  The loot won't be as good as the stuff that requires
raids though.
