This pertains to SKs as well. I play a 39 DE SK, nice large mana pool.
But you're right, unless I have clarity, and to a lesser extent a bard
playing mana song non-stop, I *can't* keep up the barrage of spells I'd
like to, in a typical non-stop pulling group. It's even worse when I'm
the puller; I barely can keep mana enough to pull with spells sometimes.
But give me a clarity, and I can basically maintain a constant mana pool
while fighting or pulling and still cast a few theft spells and a dot or
two. You are right about soloing; bigger mana pool is very important.
This is why ogre and troll SKs are actually probably better in the long
haul for group situations; I still wouldn't trade my DE SK though =)
(although I might create an ogre SK for the hell of it when I peak on my
DE SK's fun factor).
