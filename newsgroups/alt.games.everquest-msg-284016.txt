Yes, that IS a nuisance. Quick tip for those who don't know: as long
as my pet hasn't engaged a *new* target, I can click on my pet (who
maintains focus on it's *last* target), then type /assist, then type
/loot.  That way I can loot mobs who fell into a rock or wall, etc.

You all probably know that trick, though.
