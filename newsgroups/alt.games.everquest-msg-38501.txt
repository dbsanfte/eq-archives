And you are a major mental retard or have the reading comprehension of an 8
year old.

A newbie in my book is level 1-6. Probably would extend it to level 9 for
Rangers and Paladins.

Are you in a mental stupor or something? We have probably had 20 posts in
the last month about 'How do I make money' or 'I am level 16 and broke'.

I want you to know, when I talk about people that rationalize and believe
"The Big Lie", I am talking about you. You have the ability to ignore facts
