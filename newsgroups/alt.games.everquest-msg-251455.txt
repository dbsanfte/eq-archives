I agree. Even though, because of the companies I've worked for, my 
livelihood has always depended on copyright enforcement, I'm sick and 
tired of DRM that only inconveniences legal users and the disgustingly 
dishonest practice of trying to pass off every pirate copy of a CD or a 
piece of software ever found as the loss of a full price sale, to claim 
ridiculously inflated damages.

Generally speaking... if a student's computer is found to contain the 
equivalent to a thousand CDs, it doesn't follow that he would have 
bought $15k worth of CDs if P2P hadn't been invented.
