Unlikely. Or rather, unlikely in any important way. One of the nice
things about having 60 gigs of hard drive space is that I can easily
afford complete multiple installs of Agent. I take considerable care
to separate my personas by genre. Here I'm Lokari; in 'professional'
newsgroups I use my real name; in Wicca discussions I (now) use my
Wiccan name, and so on.

I find that this separation of my various interests is quite valuable.
For example, my professional clients might be put off by my posting
style here, or might be uncomfortable with my religious leanings, etc.

So, while a game group stalker might follow me into another game
group, he wouldn't be able to follow me to my other haunts.


That said, as much as I tend to disagree with Drake, I find it very
difficult to picture him as the stalking type. He might show up in
another group I participate in out of valid interest in the group
topic, but I seriously doubt he'd go there just to harass me. He's got
way more class than that.
