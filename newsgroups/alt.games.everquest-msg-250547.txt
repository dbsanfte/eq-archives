Philisophically I don't accept it in EQLive because that amounts to 
changing the rules while I'm playing. I wouldn't have signed up in the 
first place if it was a buy-your-pp-here ruleset, and I resent any move 
by Sony to change the fundamental premises of the game that I enjoy.

If they want to do it on an alt rules server... go nuts.
