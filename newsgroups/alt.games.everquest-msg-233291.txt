Don't let the puller keep you under 20% mana. You should have plenty to deal
with an overpull at all times, even when there's crowd control handy. You,
the slower, and the cc should dictate the pull rate, not the puller who's
used to his uber buddies.
If the puller keeps chain pulling while any critical caster is saying lom,
oom, med break etc. use the old "afk bio after this mob" trick. He pulls it,
he can kill it.
If he promptly wears you out again, let the group know youre done with him,
pullers are usually easier to replace than clerics.

Dont be afraid of beastlord or ranger tanks, the ones who cant hack it
usually wont volunteer for the job.

Pls Pls OMFG Pls do something in addition to healing if you can hack it.
Your class has tons of cool options at its disposal. The clerics I like are
the ballsy ones, who do stuff like landing an 8 second stun on the mob as it
comes into camp, to give the war something to taunt his agro up with, handy
when the chanter would be pulling agro nearly evey mob with tash & slow. DPS
is king as long as you dont have to take a med break because of it, nuke
when FM, melee if you have yaulp 6 & your best armor. Root mezzes so you
dont have to rez the chanter later. Stun & bash healers. Put hp buffs on
pets if you have the mana. Dispel DS if you have a spellslot for it. Youve
got even more you can do, stretch your class to the limit, youll have more
fun.
