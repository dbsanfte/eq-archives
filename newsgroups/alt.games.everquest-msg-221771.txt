Yup. Seriously, there is a make-up add on TV here in Australia where the
main catch line is "Because your worth it". It is just supply and demand,
any enviroment where the male:female ratio is skewed one way or another, the
minority sex in the most demand is susceptable to thinking they are gods
gift and special in every sort of way.

By the way - I do not have any special gripe against women - I pretty much
loathe everyone equally. It's called being a chronic asshole ; )

Yah - Necro's over 53 can res themselves using an essence emerald which used
to be nearly impossible to get hold of, but these days with the bazaar you
can pick them up in bulk for less than 300pp a piece. The reason why essence
emeralds were so hard to get hold of is that you create them by casting
Sacrifice on someone level 45 or above. This has.. ahh.. "side effects"...
<fine print>such as eating a XP death with no way or regaining lost
xp</fineprint> ...trivial thing really.
