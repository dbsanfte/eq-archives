Ok, a couple of things here.

Zone-pulling is rather like using profanity in a news group; it shows you've
run out of imagination and talent.  ( Flame retardant suit on! )
Zone-pulling is also regarded as 'intentional training' by SOE if there is a
group at the zoneline you're training, as is the case here.  Also, after Mr.
Ingenuity had zoned out, the mob he was pulling was not aggroed on his group
but rather only on your group; if the other group had more than proximity
aggro, it would have run back to them instead of attacking you.  This means
that the other group had not 'engaged' the mob; since your group HAD engaged
the mob ( done at least 1 point of damage to it ) the other group was in the
wrong trying to KS *you*.  All in all - the guy is full of it.
