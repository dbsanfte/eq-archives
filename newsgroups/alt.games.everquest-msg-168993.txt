That's been brought up before, but there's a hitch. Believe it or not,
there is a whole established, tight knit community on Test, including a
number of guilds all the way up to Ubahguilds killing Emp and in the
later Tier planes. Certainly not as high powered as the biggest and most
uber of the proddies, though.

Allowing an automated mechanism where somebody like FoH, Afterlife, Dark
Horizons or Triton could just spur-of-the-moment copy their entire guild
over there to lay waste to the server would be.... upsetting to say the
least.

And before anyone says, "Yes, well, too bad. It's a *test* server and
they should know that.", I will remind you that, while that is true,
those are the dedicated people who *always* test everything for Sony and
put up with the endless crap of ten server downtimes a day, Pwipes, etc.
and still do the job for them. I doubt that the Powers That Be want to
piss them off that badly.
