You're right, you see that a lot and it's unfortunate.

Personally, I'm surprised so many druids keep kiting at all though.
Root-DoT'ing, especially with my ES arms, seems far more efficient.
Mob goes down slightly faster (those 100+ damage roots add up), and
you're medding during much of the fight, so you have loads more mana
at the finish than the kiter.  Much less danger of adds or irritating
other players too.

My druid gave up kiting long ago.  I have to admit, I haven't tried
quad-kiting yet, but it sounds to me as though there must be some
heavy-duty downtime afterwards.
