I can't imagine what you were doing at 20 that you had useless nukes,
but I was smacking damned hard at 20 with my nukes, thanks for asking.
Add to that that I had a functioning root spell - and I could
root/nuke/nuke/nuke without blinking.

You -did- cancel magic, right? Oh, Gordon, Gordon, Gordon. :-)

Since I mostly play a Druid these days, I will say I love having the
DoTs in my arsenal.  The ability to switch from root kiting to fear
kiting allows much more flexibility in response.

Where most young wizards become frustrated is in having to develop
research skills in order to obtain their 20/24 spells.  Either that,
or they have to get the components and convince someone with higher
skill to research the spell for them.

It's just like having a giant cheese wheel hanging over your head,
just tanatlizing out of reach.
