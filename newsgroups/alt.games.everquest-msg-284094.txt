I could be very wrong, but it is my understanding that you skill on a weapon 
primarily by the number of times you actually do damage with it, not by the 
number of kills you or a group does while you hold a certain category of 
weapon.  So, if the mob you are attemping to kill is a magic-only mob you 
will get no skill-up using a non-magic fine steel weapon.  Neither will you 
skill if you use that reliable mino axe and only finish with the the 
new-category weapon.
