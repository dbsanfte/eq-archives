Not sure what you mean by your anonymous "Tom" statement above, but my
first name really is Tom.  Is your real name suppose to be Kaev or
Gaston?   My isp outsources their news service using supernews.com.
Did that bother you?

Kaev or whatever your name is, you are definately a loser.  You need
to get a real job.
