*Never* did I say that it has no place. This entire thread is about
*toning it down* first and whether or not foul language is offensive
second. I for one never claimed it should be eliminated. I just
maintain that people are deluding themselves if they don't think using
profanity is offensive. It is.

Uh...no it's not, and you don't think so either. Give me a break.

Of course it is. I don't see your point.

I am saying it to you. You brought you mother into this by championing
a cause so derelict. You are a reflection of her efforts.

Btw, why is that offensive to you? After all, I'm not meaning to
insult her. I'm just stating what I believe to be fact. You can't
define why it's wrong? It must be ok then.
