Is the new Froglok race live yet? I've logged on and tried to create a
new character, but nothing. Checked the options to download LOY, and
have done so, but nothing. Or is it not going live until the entire
package is out? That differers from the LOY site, which says "NOW" for
Frogloks..

I WANT MY FROGGIES, DAMMIT!

I have the perfect name for him, too.
