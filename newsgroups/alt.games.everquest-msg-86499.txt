Yeah and the worst part is that your lack of foresight about your
account security becomes just like the "as long as you don't tell
anyone else the secret!" playground clause. The secret playground
clause is where you get told a secret and are told not to tell, then
someone else wants to know and you say "okay but make sure you don't
tell!" Of course your lack of security makes it so they are a lot more
likely to tell also. Its the same with accounts when sometimes you
have people asking in guild chat, "anyone have Doc's info?" I see that
all the time, people actually give it  sometimes also.

There is just no way to give your account info to a "friend" in game
and really expect them to never then let someone else also use it.

Actually its a sign of being a 15 year old kid, which is what the
person was. That is another reason why you just don't do this. I just
found out that someone in my guild I just assumed was as old as I am,
because they are really mature and probably type better than I do, was
only 16 years old. Its nice and all that the person seems older on the
surface but think back to when you were 16 and how moral and selfless
you were then, scary eh?

Unfortunately the law would be on the side of his parents as far as
harrassment, you don't even really need to do much. The phone company
will cooperate with the cops and things. Meanwhile its pretty much the
burden of the person who has the account problem to prove that the
other person committed what is basically wire fraud. People HAVE taken
people who screwed them on the internet to the cleaners, but it takes
a LOT of legal doing and time and  some initial money. People on the
net get away with it more often because victims don't always bother.
