Whee, it's quiz time! :D  And this one has a *lot* of possible results,

I came out Elrond...have to say I'm pretty happy about that one, seeing as
I've always admired that character a lot.

"A stern yet benevolent organizer who often knows best, your wits are
keenly fixed on aiding efforts you deem worthy.

Now at this last we must take a hard road, a road unforseen. There lies
our hope, if hope it be. To walk into peril to Mordor. "
