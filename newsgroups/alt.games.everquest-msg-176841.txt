The Iksar can't wear plate thing is not really true anymore with all sorts
of fun new plate type armors in the game.  A lot of the good stuff is level
limited, so not usable, or stats are very reduced at your current level.
Take a quick peak at allakhazam, you can find a wide variety there.  Here is
a list of player crafted breastplates that are Iksar SK wearable.  There are
plenty of others that are not player made as well.  I may be off on some of
the levels here, allakhazam is not always right on those.
