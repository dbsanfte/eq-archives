You have a P4 running at 1.6GHz - 1st piece of advice, upgrade to at least
512MB if not 768 or 1024.

Get rid of the wimpy video card, the * least * you want is a GeForce 4 Ti
4200 64MB if you want it to last you a year or two, if you can afford it go
for a nice ATI Radeon 9700 model.

28.8 is the minimum to run decently in EQ - unfortunately where you are it's
hard to get anything better but the aforementioned upgrades will do you a
word of good, and let you get the most out of what connection you have.

Zoning time is also affected by your testure quality, all that data has to
be loaded etc. and also Luclin models will slow you down.
