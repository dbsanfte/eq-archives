I think they hired him strictly for his looks - he had that innocent,
handsome, farm-boy look to him back then.  Then he got into a car accident
that required facial reconstructive surgery (rumor has it he did it on
purpose to get out of an "Eight is Enough" contract).  That's why The Empire
Strikes Back begins with Luke getting clobbered in the face - to explain why
his face looks so different.

Lucas seems to have a thing for appearance over acting skills.  He just got
lucky that Ford could act *and* look good.  =)  This would explain why poor
Jake Lloyd got cast - he was a terrible actor but gosh, he looked cute.
