Imagine if tanks only had to stand close to a rooted mob so the mob didn't
kill the ones doing the most damage..
that is... ***sooo lame***.... why doesn't the rooted mob turn and kill the
rogue then the monk or even the cleric first?

42... I know you think ****your**** way to play EQ is the only bestest real
gamers ***way*** to do things and everyother way is lame.
but... I for one am glad there are more than a few ways to kill mobs.
in my opinion the only lame ways are those with zero risk
