That may be true. However, the book argument just focuses on the software 
itself and leaves out any discussion of the _service_ that Verant is 
selling which is what this discussion is really all about.

Even if they removed the EULA _entirely_, it's still a service and Verant 
has the right to discontinue that service at any time to a particular user 
with no need whatsoever to give a reason. They are not _required_ to take 
your money.

So, sure, sell your EQ CD for $30, $300, or even $3000, Feel free. However, 
there is no law that says that Verant has to offer the purchaser of second-
hand software an account.
