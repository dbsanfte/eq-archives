He probably isn't out there grouping though. The twink with a 500k
budget will most likely be soloing (or PL'd). ... and if he is
grouping, odds are that he's grouping for the company and won't care
about the gear that everyone else has since nobody can live up to his
standards anyway.

Luckily those are easily avoided.

I take it that you ask people to link their Magelo before allowing
them to group with you? At least on Bristlebane, things don't work
that way.

Do you really want them determining things like drop rates on magic
items (or spells) based on real world pricing? It affects things even
if you don't sell the very high end stuff because the accountants
would have to get involved in game design:

Designer: I think I'll add this Fungi 2.0 as a drop in the next
expansion. 

Accountant: Sorry, you can't do that. Our revenue stream from the
Fungi 1.0 is currently $50,000 per month. If you add this new item
with twice the regen and 100 extra hitpoints, we'll have to drop the
price of the old one by 2/3's. Our shareholders wouldn't stand for it!


Even in a game where item selling is gonna happen. There are definite
advantages to keeping it illegal (in game terms).
