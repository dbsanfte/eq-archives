1) If you are a known ninja, your not getting into any guild thats AoW
capable or above.  For somebody in my guild, that means your not likely to
get a gear upgrade anytime this year (we farmed CT, nToV, tormy/yeli etc
hardcore - chances are the few nice pieces, you'd already have)
2) Its pretty well known that one of our officers runs her log file 24/7
