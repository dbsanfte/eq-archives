Must be regular cloth sandals- all I keep finding is small cloth sandals 
  and they don't work in the combine for the newbie armor.

I'm pouting here, and there's few things more terrifying than a baby 
gnome pouting.

Will pay up to 5pp for them.

Would like suggestions as to what I should keel that may drop the proper 
shoes too.
