Interesting possibilities, but not all of them. You missed the one
that applies to me - I just feel like doing it. No ulterior motives. I
see an interesting post, I reply to it, I don't give two shakes of a
rat's tail what anyone thinks of it.

Do you?

Do you really care what anyone here thinks? Do you believe you will
need their support someday? Do they have some kind of qualifications
that makes their opinion of you worth something?

Which is another discussion. All that means to me is other people are
obsessive enough to not be able to move forward. And you're accusing
me of psychosis *giggle*

When it changes topic into a flamefest directed at me, its definately
not a non sequitur.

*shrug* Some people go that route.

I'm not a better person.

Do you see me losing sleep over that revelation?

*shrug*

Do you see me worrying? Let the little people flame. They don't have
anything I haven't seen - and laughed at - before.

Do you see me crying? Personally I find it amusing when they become so
riled up. Shows how wrapped up in themselves they really are.

I post here because you were mistaken about my motivations. I don't
need to justify anything. No one is forced to read my posts. I don't
use sockpuppets and my author header never changes. So if they don't
see any reason to keep coming back at me... why do they? :-)

They claim to killfile, but they *just can't resist*. Really, we'd all
be happier if they just did so I wouldn't need to deal with their
unprovoked abusiveness in the way they so sorrowfully lament.

>Just...take my advice; I wish no ill-will on you.  Take it down a notch.

Abuse follows abuse. I don't hold grudges. I forget who said what in a
couple days anyways. My filters expire after two weeks and I rarely
even notice.


>Don't argue back at me here to show how wrong I was in my post here, just
>take it down a notch and you'll find much less heat on you around here.

Why? Your post has enough interesting elements to debate. As for
heat... I can hack it.
