I did indeed.. in fact I've never heard of it at all!  Might want to
check
the "not buffable" status since the emergency patch, prior to yesterday
the cleric pet was also not buffable.  UHOF is also a mob drop spell,
as far as I recall (got it ages ago from a friend who knew I was looking
forward to a pet no matter how bad)

Even if FSOX is buffable, wizards don't have much to buff with.  Is it
suicidal?  Man I'd give a lot for UHOF to stop killing itself off, it
would
be a real pet then, no matter how mana consuming and deaf it is!
