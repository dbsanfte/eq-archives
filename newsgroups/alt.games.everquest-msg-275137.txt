Yep, I think that is a much better way of doing it than originally put
forward.
Given that I tradeskill for the majority of my time online it is nice to
know in future that it will be beneficial to do so.
There is now a 10 level difference in guild mains between those who go out
adeventuring and those that stay behind and tradeskill.
Tradeskill heritage quests sounds pretty good too.

Hope it's all sooner =)
