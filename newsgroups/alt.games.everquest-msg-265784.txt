I've had a very similar impression. It's neat and interesting and the 
graphics *are* very good, but I'm having some trouble acquiring a taste 
for the more cartoony feel of it all.

They've done a fantastic job of eliminating the recovery process after 
battles in favor of more emphais on hp/mana management tactics during the 
fight. That said, it's kind of eliminated the need for me to ever eat or 
drink, unless I'm missing something. I can recover from nearly dead and 
out of mana to full on both in seconds.

One thing that I don't like, however, is how easy it is at first. I'm 
only level 7 at this point, but I've not come close to dying yet as a 
Tauren shaman. Maybe I'm just still in the hand-holding stage, but lack 
of danger = little excitement so far.
