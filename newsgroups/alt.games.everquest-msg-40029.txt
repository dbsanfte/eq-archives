just you understand, i quit counting plat after 5k, prolly another 8k or so
into it after, current smithing skill is 178, about 75% success on plate
for that 13k, you could buy a set of quest armor (crafted, darkforge, ivy,
whatever) and a couple of really nice weapons, too
tradeskills will never make you any money in any real sense (since the
baking and fletching nerfs a ways back)

on the other hand, all; my twinks are in full plate now, usually red (ranger
in ornate chain, nice stuff, 3 ac less than bronze, half the weight of
banded)   :)
