Varies by server, but for the more common ports that does seem to be
the going price.

In my experience, the cost of a port is as subject to the means of the
buyer as it is the accepted value. In other words, IMO newbies can't
be expected to pay as much as high levels, simply because they don't
have the money.

But then, I don't charge for ports anyway. I'll occasionally port
someone specifically because they're offering a big chunk of cash and
I always want cash, but otherwise, if I'm willing to port someone I
take them for free.


Since you're a newbie, here's a word of advice - don't take ports for
awhile. Run instead. The reason is that you'll be a lot better
prepared to cope with the world of Norrath if you've actually seen
some of it. From time to time I run across some mid-to-high level (and
not, I think, an ebay buy) person who has no clue how to get from N.
Karana to W. Commons except by porting. Not only have they missed some
interesting places, they're often looked on by other players as
complete idiots.


>But if I am seeking a buff, what is customary to donate??

Depends again on the buff and the levels of the people involved. My 45
druid regularly offers a payment (I prefer that word over 'donation')
of 30 to 40 plat for a clarity or better.

Back when I was unable to bind myself, I generally offered 5 to 10
plat for a bind (which was a lot of money to me at the time).

The bank itself is the money changer. Grab the pile of copper coins in
the bank, and drop them on one of the other coin denominations, and
they will automatically be converted. You can change money down to
smaller denominations the same way.
