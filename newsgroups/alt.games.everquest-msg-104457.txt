Perhaps because in first person view you couldn't see what is going on?
Unlike everquest or other MMORPG's you don't just fight one monnster go sit
down go fight another monster.  (yes i know sometimes people do crazy things
like pull 4 monsters at a time for AE spells)  But this game is a "dungeon
crawler" look it up.  The idea is that you don't have to sit for 2 hours to
get your life back up because you never bothered with "bind wound" and no
cleric wants to help you out because you wanted to split the gems instead of
having the cleric keep them all.  You have an overhead view which allows for
complete access to the area you are in and the multitude of monsters that
are attacking your "party" can be set upon quickly and effectively.  And
since it doesn't seem like you own the game, you can use the mousewheel
 (or - = signs to zoom in and out) and you can get an "almost" first person
view by targetting one group member and zooming all the way in...Ok enough
quotation marks for me.

By the way, this is the game Diablo 2 should have been.  My wife and I have
been playing it all weekend, it is put together so well.  it r0xx0rs LOL.
