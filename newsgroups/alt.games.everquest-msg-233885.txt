Whilst going into kurns tower at level 15 cleric I bumped into a guy
(melee class dont know which who was super buffed) he then asks me to
join him for a group, just me and him.  So I now use all my mana
getting him to 100%. He then takes on a skely whilst fighting disbands
the group and shouts at me ITS MY KILL. Ok I have been used - made me
laugh raped for mana lol.

Now sitting medding at entrance he's off creating havoc suddenly picks
up adds soon is yelling for help, so I sat there! He then brings over
3 mobs and runs around me so I move this goes on for a while so I zone
out, back in the same happens - goes on for about 10 minutes.

So I thought, I dont like you very much now cancel magic and root
him - 1st would it work on a player.   2nd would you consider it
valid.

I didnt do this but I thought very strongly of doing so - considering
all I did was enter the zone!!
