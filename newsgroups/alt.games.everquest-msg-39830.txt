>> Why hide the information? What is the point? <<

The following is the official reason for hiding the numbers:

GD: We've seen recently on the test server that a number of players on each
server is being concealed - is there any reason for that?

BM: Yeah, there is. In the past, we have been really open about that, but as
the massively multiplayer genre is expanding, and with more and more
competition, we did make a decision as a company to hide those numbers,
because it's basically information that our competition doesn't really need
to know. We prefer to be open, but we're running a business too, we have to
recognise that the competition is out there, so it was a hard decision, but
I think it was the right one.


GD is Games Domain, who hosted the interview. BM should be simple enough to
figure out :)
