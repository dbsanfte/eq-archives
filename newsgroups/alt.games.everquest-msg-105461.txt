That is pretty much the average routine, which makes the alternatives that
much more appealing. Levels 12 to 20 I normally spend bouncing between Kerra
island and Warrens, depending on whether I need plat or straight out XP.
Full soloing, no groups. The only thing to bear in mind is you need
snare/root ability for Kerra Island, but the XP is great if you do have
that.
