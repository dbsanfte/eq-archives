My latest tale of beggars is a little long, sorry, I'll try to keep it
short.

In EC (home of the beggar) A newbie warrior shouts asking if his weapon
(Fine Steel) is good for a 5th level character. I didn't have Fine Steel
until I was about 9th, myself but I know what he is getting at (he want's
better) so I offer to provide him a better weapon if he makes 6th and then
find me in the zone.
He makes 6th and after many clues, fails to find me. It is during this time
that it occurs to me I may not be dealing with someone who ties his own
laces. I go to the tunnel (after confirming he knows the location of that)
and tell him to find me there...he needs help with that part but eventual I
get the hail and hand over a Dark Edged Two hander (23/40 +6int/str +20mana)
and some Earthen Gaunts (AC10 +5str) more than he deserved but...
I log on an alt and have a couple of hours of unfulfilling play whilst being
told how my SK's spells work and why I should help someone find their corpse
(a guild status reveals them to be some old buddies, not, who I have had
nothing but shit from ever since my main got to a level where our hunting
grounds might cross) I finally log off alt, not that happy and get a tell
from Newbie warrior complaining his new weapon doesn't do as much damage as
it should, not in the mood I tell him to return it for full refund or give
it to someone who would appreciate it and go back to Fine Steel (the first
of these suggestions seems to confuse him more than any shoe lace) I log...I
don't return for 3 days.

I get a tell, am I in EC? Erm yes...this is Newbie Warriors Alt...another
Warrior, eh? can I do him a favour, feeling a little guilty over not
explainig the damage caps on out last exchange, I agree. He asks if he can
trust me, WTF? What am I gonna do, take the stuff back I gave him? I suggest
that that is a pointless question as if he couldn't why I really tell him so
(I consider doing a Paul Whitehouse Fast Show sketch about being a bit of a
"geezer" but figure that would go so far above his head it wouldn't be in
the same solar system) He logs his main on (now wearing and carrying new
equipment, palladium axe, at a guess and Sarny tabard + some bronze,
beggings going well then) and then realises the equipment he wants to swap
is in the bank...I agree to wait...
The tell finally comes back, he has SOLD the items he wanted to swap...</me
sighs>...could I spare some plat for his other character?!?
Him and his (other) Warrior alt (prolly created to get more equipment by
playing on the hard done by newbie look) are now on my ignore list...
