1) Shaman
2) Pally (you wanted REZ or i'd have put in SK)
3) Monk
4) Rogue

3 melees because you have the best melee buffer in the game... if you didnt
insist on using a shammy i might've suggested a chanter and a bunch of
casters but probably not... Anyway monks make fine pullers and the pally is
the closest thing to a warrior that can rez or a cleric that can fight that
you'll ever find. Rogue because they dmg like no tomorrow.

Your group will be uber from whenever shammy's get their first haste spell
(16?) until 40's where you'll wish you also had a cleric (cheal begins to
dominate at last) but adding a cleric into a 4 man group and having only 2
people dealing most of the damage will do horrid things to your output.

A big plus for that group would be c3 on the shammy.

Cheers,
James
