heh not 1... not 2... but 4 guide books are wrong (Kunark, Kunark
Revised&Expanded, Trilogy and SoL) possibly 5 (forgot about the first one, I
think it has it wrong too tho) all have instill doubt as lv22 Ranger skill.
Guess the guy who wrote it NEVER played and VI/Sony don't care *sigh*

Abit OT here.... I found it interesting when the Kunark guide book have 1
full page of startegy on how to use Enchanter pet and guess what.... Mage
pet startegy is only 1/4 of a page info(!?) heh I guess mage is really
MASTER of summonings so mages only need summon the pet up and pet will do
the rest itself.
