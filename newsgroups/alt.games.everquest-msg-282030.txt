Hi!

I'm buildinga  guild website for a EQ2 guild using php-nuke and now I hope
someone here can help me with an essential part.
I feel the look of the site is important to give the right feeling to the
members, but so far I've been unable to find a fantasy based theme for nuke
to use. If anyone here have a EQ/Fantasy theme they don't mind sharing i
would apreciate it very much!

Best Wishes
Thomas
