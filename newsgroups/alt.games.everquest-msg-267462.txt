If they remove the barrier to server transfer (it's almost pure profit for
them to charge for some batch file to run) then i think they could extend
eq1 for many years. Certainly i would have been still playing if i could
have grouped with my friends without paying extra for the priviledge. And
losing my gear is absurd, now.  Just decommision a few servers as the
population decreases and the maintenance costs for them will go down.
