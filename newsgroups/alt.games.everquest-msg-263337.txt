Yes they are social, and if you can get some boots that are magic, you can 
kick them.  You can turn in both the Lightstones and Greater Lightstones to 
one of the gypsies in N. Karana for some experience.  They Greater 
Lightstones will give you a book that is work 7 to 9pp to a vendor.  Be sure 
you have an open slot.  Another good place to hunt them is the island in 
Erud's crossing, just don't kill the beetles.
