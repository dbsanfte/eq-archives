Well, I'm not sure this is it, but I found it on Castersrealm :

EQ GAME CRASHES

This from the Technical Support forum:
If you are getting an EQGAME.EXE error and have a GeForce video card, make
sure you are using the recommended video driver. You can get this driver
from our website at
http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/compatability_matrix.jsp ;
cross-reference your video card with your operating system and download the
recommended driver.
This problem has been seen with the 21.83 video drivers.

Other posters suggested re-installing DirectX 8.1 and then installing the
new video drivers to correct the problem.
