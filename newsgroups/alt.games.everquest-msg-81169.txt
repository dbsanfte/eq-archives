No, we can only tell what we see here; which, in this thread, does not speak
well.  Nothing personal, I don't know you from Adam, I must form my opinion
based soley on this thread.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
