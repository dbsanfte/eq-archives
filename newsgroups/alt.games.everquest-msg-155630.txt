Last patch before this one was Sept 26. Here's a link to the patch
message:

http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4782

NO mention of a /loadskin window. THE WINDOW DID _NOT_ EXIST YET! In
fact, in today's patch message:

>NEW FILES
>
>EQUI_LoadskinWnd.xml
>EQUI_AlarmWnd

****NEW FILES: EQUI_LOADSKINWND.XML!!!!****

Okay, now fucking tell me that a brand new feature was broken for
weeks before it even existed. Didn't think so.
