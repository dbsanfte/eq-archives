Was it a druid, or was it something that required bronze?

I had a level 10 ranger on test. Got her full armor through her own
hunting, except that damned orc fibula. I eventually decided to finish
off the armor shortly before retiring. Since CB was pretty abandoned
most of the time, I created and testbuffed a druid for the sole
purpose of killing orc slavers for the ranger. Got the fibula in half
a dozen kills :)
