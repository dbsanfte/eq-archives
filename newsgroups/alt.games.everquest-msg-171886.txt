Thanks Khosh.  I truly appreciate the effort and advice your post gave
me.  Unfortunately, the whole point of the post was to hopefully find
some little gem of an abnormal zone that breaks from the norm.

Your advice is good and admittedly solid.  However, the subject of my
post said  "Alternative" adventures.  

Thanks though, maybe there just are not many choices for this level.

However, I've been doing some imaginative zone searching just by level
of mobs and I'm thinking of a couple of things like this.  I have some
other ideas but I don't want to answer my own post. LOL

Explore the Swamp of No Hope.
There seems to be lots of mobs my level.  I'm sure its far from an
optimum zone but it might be fun to explore and if I can kill a few
mobs along the way then I still have some progress.

Stonebrunt Mountains
OK its not an expansion world per say but it is a new zone that I have
not been to.
