That's about what I though ... 2-3 55+, depending on how well they
play, or four if they are just around 50 and not yet very uber
equipped. I also know a lvl 60 group can make it, and out own
guild has a pally, who made it past the city with just a shaman.
Both are total uber equipped and know a few tricks, though :)
I think I'll head for the 2-3 group option at 55+ to be on the
safe side and not screw up the epic on Kirn. Thanks!
