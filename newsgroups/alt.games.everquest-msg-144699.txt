Heh, I just tried it, and when I switch to the "Test" section there
is tons of info on stacking.  Until just now I had only ever looked
at the "Live" data, where there is still zero info on stacking for
those spells.  :-p  Thanks for the tip tho, it did lead me to the
data I was interested in.  Most of the conflicts appear to be with
various self-only buffs.  I guess I'm not too worried about conficts
with a bunch of pet buffs.  I am amused to see a conflict with the
L4 Enchanter debuff Enfeeblement.  Does this mean you can strip a
caster mob's Shielding with this cheesy little spell?  Hehe, that
might have potential, it sure seems like INT caster mobs are using
these buffs a lot since the caster mob changes went in.  Or maybe
it doesn't matter since the Malxxxxx debuffs already conflict.

Ah, thanks for the clarification, I didn't realize Wolfie was
describing two different conflicts there.  Not much chance of
me messing that up though, I can't recall the last time I used
the Holy Armor line on a caster, seems a waste of mana since
their AC has been well below the "sweet spot" for the last 20
or 30 levels.

Thanks to you and Wolfie for the help.
