Wooooooooo frickin' Hooooooooo about damned time.  My god, the guards in misty thicket at
the wall were the main reason it took my druid over a month to get his armor pieces made.
Every damned time he was killing a giant spider or whatnot some stupid fatling guard would
run on a rampage and kill everything.  My god, those guards were like little whirlwinds of
death and mayhem running rampant through the area between the wall and runnyeye.
