That's the main reason I like EQ. I was playing Horizons, and I
thought to myself, what's the point? You die and are respawned without
loss of any kind...

Then I came back to EQ and found that the death penalty below 10th
level was drasticly reduced. I'm not sure I like the way it's done
now... On the other hand, I only spend a very short time below 10th
level in EQ anyway, so I can live with it.
