What is there?
A fresh start. A chance to get it right without having to pander to 
1000s of people with 1000s of hours already invested in their 
characters...who like the world the way it is!!

And an opportunity to take a look at all the things that make EQ suck:

A poor stat system. A menial tradeskill system. A badly broken economic 
system that is particularly vulnerable to mudflation. Dumb as rocks AI. 
'Aggro management' (What is that anyways... I mean really... what dragon 
is going to be taunted into wailing on a tank being chain CHealed 
anyways...??) Mobs that have to be given ridiculous powers just to be a 
challenge... casting LoS spells through walls, insane mana regen, 
casters that hit lke melees, mobs that can literally move 'through' a 
wall of players to get to their 'aggrod' target, the 'main tank system' 
is an 'artifact' of everquests ruleset, not a realistic tactic, the fact 
that most of the quests are solved by looking up walkthrus instead of 
being dynamic, where a 5th level shadowknight after bringing back 4 
snake skins will be tasked with killing the 45th level captain of the 
guard, and quests that require you to mindlessly camp a single spawn 
point for hours on end hoping one day he'll drop what you need... (and 
the only reason you have even the slightest idea where to hunt at all is 
because you looked it up on the net), and even then it takes you a week 
of camping one mob to get the item... there is a lot of room to improve 
the 'basic fundamental' game.

Plus from a developers point of view. EQ is not only dated, but its a 
heavily bandaged system with enough bad design choices repeatedly 
rearing their ugly heads hampering and delaying development, and 
contributing to endless bugs, bugs that get fixed and then popup 
again...  a fresh codebase would speed and simplify ongoing development.

So what if the aged EQ1 population is content to while away their time 
in EQ1. There are more than enough people disenfranchised with EQ1 to 
switch to EQ2, and there are tons of people who aren't in any mmrpg but 
have little interest in hopping into a mudflated world with 1000s of 
maximum level players wandering around, where the quests are all solved, 
and all that remains is mindlessly following in some uberguilds 
footsteps, while they read up on how to get their character upgraded 
equipment in some forum...they wait for eq2 with baited breath... so to 
speak.

All that said... I don't have the highest hopes for EQ2 despite the 
potential. SWG is a dismal title in my opinion; the current SoE team 
just doesn't have the vision to revolutionize the mmrpg genre.
