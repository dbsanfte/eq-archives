The only bitch I have about PLing is when people do it where non-PLers are 
trying to play the normal way.  That being said, I'd take your Pally with 
your druid to S. Ro and rotate through all the Orc Camps.  I've never, ever 
seen them hunted.  Snare the Orc far away ( so the healers don't heal the 
one getting beaten on ), let it kill itself on the DS and make sure the 
Pally hits it once.  After you get tired of the Orcs, maybe the Derv camps 
in Oasis.  They've been empty recently on my server.  Even Orc highway has 
been low populated, probably enough to where you can PL up to 18 or so and 
not get in the regular players' ways.

I've been killing the Evil Eyes in the Gorge for cash lately, and hate 
seeing the EXP go to waste.  Now that my pet won't attack a Mezzed 
opponant, I have friends come over that are of appropriate EXP level and PL 
them while I farm.  Nuke, let the pet almost kill it, mez it, mem blur, let 
the low-level guy finish it for Exp..  There are enough wandering Minos 
that there's always constant EXP between the Eye kills.  Can't beat it.
