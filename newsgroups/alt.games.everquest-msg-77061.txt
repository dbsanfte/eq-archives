Is it possible to use the row boats in lake Rath, how does one do that? Has
anyone went fishing from a row boat? Has anyone ever been attacked when they
where in a row boat? If you die in a rowboat how do you find your corpse?
I have a 16 lvl druid and with sow, enduring breath, and invise I have swam
around the lake a bite,but have not fought anything. I want to do the hermit
in the southwest corner and think a rowboat would be handy.

thanks in advance
