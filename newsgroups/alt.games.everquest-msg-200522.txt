Well, that would have been simply out of a desire on their part to 
protect their own privacy. I don't blame anyone for not wanting to be 
pestered all the time. By silliness, I mean all the inconveniences caused 
by peoples' insistence upon having KEI before venturing out. Also, the 
very act of being a KEI vending machine.

Additionally, you can't deny that all casters in a group having KEI 
alters the gameplay a bit, specifically removing the need for a certain 
amount of strategy and experience from the equation.
