It's not an elitist guild, it's a focused guild.  It is just focused
on stuff that doesn't interest you, which is fine.  Any of the newer
uber-mobs now require a large, well-equiped, well-disciplined gang of
folks who know exactly what to do to even have a chance to drop them.
It's not just the levels and the equipment that matter, it's knowing
what to do, and knowing that the others your with do too.
If you're serious about attempting the toughest mobs, you have to
spend a lot of time hunting with your guild, in the hardest zones,
against the hardest non-uber mobs before you can take on the really
big mobs.  The only way that I know to do that is to be in a guild of
similarly minded people who do almost all their hunting together.
There is a lot to be said for knowing that cleric_01 is great for
keeping main tanks alive, but cleric_02 is better at keeping the whole
group alive.  
People have mentioned that they join guilds for the chat and such, and
that's great.  Others join guilds for roleplaying, which is also
great.  Nobody bitches about joining guilds for these reasons, or
complains that these guilds are just graphical chatrooms or full of RP
geeks, but as soon as someone mentions a guild that is focused on
high-level mobs certain people get out the high horse and start
spouting that only an elitist snob would want to join such a guild.  
The 55+ guilds aren't for everyone, just as the racial guilds, and
roleplay guilds aren't for everyone.  It certainly doesn't affect your
enjoyment of the game, so lighten up, play the game you enjoy, and let
others enjoy their game.
