I'm level 51 now and have collected some FR and CR gear for killing Naggy
and Vox.

Well, actually I've done it so that I can heal others while THEY kill Naggy
and Vox, but anyway....

Is there any use for FR and CR gear now that these dragons will soon no
longer be available to me? I was thinking of getting a Froglok crown but
since I've only got one or two more raids left in my career I wonder if its
worth it.

Frankly, I'm not sure how useful my resist gear has been. On this next Vox
raid I'm going to reduce CR gear for more mana since its never been their
spells that killed me. I either get summoned and crushed for healing people
or I go OOM because I've got too much CR gear on that replaced my WIS. Maybe
I should loan my resist stuff to the members of my party so they don't need
to be healed so much. ;-)
