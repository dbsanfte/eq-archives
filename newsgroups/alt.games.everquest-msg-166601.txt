I'd suggest Seafuries in OOT. Walked out with 1kpp more than I started
with after 4 hours last night... Plus, they still give good xp at your
level. If you're lucky enough to catch Gornit uncamped, go for him
every time he pops (about every 5 minutes or so(!!)). He's a named HG
who drops the same coin that the ones in RM drop, so that will boost
your coin income even further. The seafuries drop gems, amulets, etc
(merchant fodder) that sell to merchants for up to 90pp each - not
common, but not overly rare either - and up to 6pp in coin per kill.
