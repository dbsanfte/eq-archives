When talking to the NPC kitty in one of the tents to the left of the
road as you exit the city, he tells you what to give him.  He wants 3
dark claw claws (or something like that) and a practice flail.

He mentions something like "enhancement" but I can't get him to keep
talking.  I have tried "what enhancement", etc but nothing...

Has anyone done this?
