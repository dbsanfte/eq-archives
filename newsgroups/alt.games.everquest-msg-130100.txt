 As soon as my monk hit 51 I turned on aaxp at 50%, mostly just to get a
visible idea as to the actual gain rate/difference between xp and aaxp. So
far, about 4.5 blues of xp and 6.5 blues of aaxp. This has been gained
killing seafuries with another monk in OOT. Maybe it's gained at a level 50
rate?
