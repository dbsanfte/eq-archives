Hehe

I was travelling through Paineel on route to The Warrens.

To find an interesting conversation going on. It seems that the Paineel 
guards now give faction hits with the Heretics when you kill them. As 
well as boosting Erudite ones.

As a 16th enchanter I do feel sorry for those poor souls who have lost 
their money farm (English Sarcasm Flagged for US readers)

They will now have to find another exploit to play with.
