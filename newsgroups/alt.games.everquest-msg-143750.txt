Dunno about you, but when I started the game, all I really saw was druids.
I still see a LOT of druids now.. the class is in no danger of dieing out

Well each to their own, some people enjoy playing clerics.  And I highly
doubt your numbers are anywhere near realistic

No the real benefit is to druids.  Now their over powered class can do even
more.

When they get bored soloing red-to-60 mobs in WW, they can now go walk into
a group as main healer.  Afterall who wants a cleric now when a druid has
cheal, but does 50x the damage + snares + utility spells?  I know I
wouldn't.

Does it?  Im with guildies for 99% of the time that i exp, so i don't see
this.

From my pickup group leveling days, i recalled that anybody could be an
asshole, regardless of class.

They can't?  I remember duoing with a druid to do kael bank, back before I
could come anywhere near to soloing the blue cons, and we did just fine.

When I duel box my shaman (the camp changes based on whether I use cleric or
shaman, or both..) I can do it with zero downtime.  Regen + slowed mob =
minimal damage taken, and when I got low on hp I still have mend
