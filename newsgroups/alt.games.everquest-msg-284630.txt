I'm trying to write a letter to my guild about waiting for assist, see 
what you think about this:
========================================================================
I've been raiding with [GUILD] for a while now, and I'd like to say, 
first, that we're a good bunch, with the right mix of classes and skills 
to get a lot of raids done.

BUT there's one big problem I've observed, and I'd really like to see if 
we can solve it.

This problem is discipline, in its pure form.

Specifically, the very simple concept of waiting for the assist call to 
be announced before engaging.

90% of the time, this really won't matter.  You hit a mob when you've 
figured out which mob is being killed, nothing bad happens.  Heck, 
you're doing damage sooner, so the mob dies sooner, who's going to 
complain.  If you happen to get aggro and get smacked around a little, 
well that lightens the load on the MT and his healer, so again, who's 
going to complain?  Even if you die, well, a few deaths now and then are 
to be expected on a raid, and if you aren't complaining, why would 
anyone else?

While thats all true, more or less, 90% of the time, its the sort of 
thing that can really degrade the performance of a raid force even 
then... but worse, the remaining 10% of the time it leads to a wipe. 
Just because you can get away with being sloppy sometimes doesn't mean 
it isn't sloppy.

One reason for you to wait for the assist call: Unmezzable mobs may be 
showing up, and the MA may have to switch to them.  The CC may then try 
to mez the MA's original target; if you're beating on it or worse have 
DOTted it, thats not going to work out.

Another, the MA is trying to build sufficient hate to lock that target 
on himself, by engaging early you are interfering with that.

Third, in some instances not only the MA, but one or more other people 
are assigned to get specific places on the hate list, in this case the 
Rampage list, and engaging early can really wreck that.

Why do we need the MA to get target lock?

1) Keeping the target focused on one person means its easy to find, 
which means the melee can keep pressure up on it instead of wasting half 
their time chasing the mob around from one spot to another while it ping 
pongs

1a) rogues, in particular, but also everyone else, including pets, 
benefit greatly from being outside the front arc of the mob; backstab 
aside, the rest of us avoid parry and dodge and riposte, which means we 
do about 15% more damage.  Mob turning around to smack someone else 
means its harder to stay out of its front arc.

2) Keeping the mob focussed on one person means straightforward healing; 
there's one guy getting hit and whatever your healing strategy is, thats 
where its going.

2a) Keeping several people alive while a mob ping pongs is difficult and 
expensive, as spot heals end up being used instead of more efficient ones

2b) inevitable deaths as result of difficulty in healing so many targets 
means raid DPS drops, and means backup tanks are often dead and unable 
to take up the slack when the MA dies, if that happens.

3) Mobs which Lifetap are healing themselves with your HP, if we can 
keep them on the MA and keep the MA Runed we can deny them those 
heals... but if its ping ponging thru the whole team, it can have all 
the lifetaps it wants

4) With some mobs, DS is a significant source of damage; the MA probably 
has the best DS, plus bard DS and potion DS, if the mob isn't hitting 
him, that damage source is going to waste.

So what am I talking about here?  Well, first, don't hit the mob before 
the assist call is made.  But more than that, don't cast on it unless 
you're specifically in a position where you're supposed to do that 
(usually someone is assigned to Tash, Malosi, Slow, etc).

But even more than that, don't even assist until the assist call is 
made.  Or do, but assist AGAIN when its made, to make sure you still 
have the correct target.  Assist on incoming, and your MA might decide 
to switch targets before calling in the raid force.

A couple years ago I was in a guild where the MA would, once or twice a 
raid, not call for assist.  He'd send me a tell (I was playing a cleric 
at the time) warning me I'd need to go flat out healing, and he'd pick a 
mob and solo it all the way to its death.  Anyone hitting it or casting 
on it without specific orders would lose all DKP earned for that raid.

That may seem harsh, or childish, but we treated it more like a 
challenge, and I have to say, it did its job.  People STOPPED breaking 
the assist discipline.  Things became a lot smoother.

So I've been haranging all the non MA about this, but there's another 
thing I've noticed.  We have several different people, myself among 
them, who've been assigned MA duty on one raid or another.  For this 
discipline thing to work, there's something WE have to do as well... and 
thats call for assist.  Every mob, every time.  Get sufficient aggro 
lock, and then call for it.  I know its tedious.  I know that when half 
the guild have already engaged the mob it seems a waste of time to call 
for assist.  But we have to do it.  There are people in the guild, and 
I'm one of them, who already have this discipline, and who aren't 
engaging that mob no matter whats happening to it until we hear that 
assist call, so you're losing DPS.

Also, by not calling for it, you're encouraging a "jump in whenever you 
like" attitude.  Thats a catch-22, you're not calling because people 
aren't waiting, and people don't wait because you aren't reliably calling.

If you don't call for assist, you tank that mob till its dead or your 
healers have run OOM and you die.  Hopefully the SA will call for assist 
now that its his turn:)
