I suspect that each zone has an 'item spawns per time period' table, so
that in EK you may get 1000 spider silks per hour being spawned as a max.
If the spiders are killed quickly the later ones spawn with less silk.

Hmm, struggling to describe what I mean, but it's based on (as you say
insufficient data) observations hunting in various zones.  If the zone is
empty, the first batch of mobs will drop a pretty high rate of stuff, and
this slows and then levels off.
