Verant is the one that decided at the last minute to require 8.1
instead of 8.0, and yeah, some of their statements implied they didn't
realize that this would break Win95 compatibility.

I don't understand that...I know that as a programmer, whenever I use
a feature in a Microsoft API that I haven't used before, I always
check to see what versions of Windows can be upgraded to a version of
that API that supports that feature.  If Win95 is not listed, I have
to go ask someone higher up to get permission to break Win95
compatibility, or to run with reduced functionality on Win95.  Guess
Verant's programmers don't have such a requirement.

Any other programmers out there?  How do you handle this?
