The only trouble with the Geo camp is actually getting it.

I spent a few days there not to long ago and never saw a time when 
someone else wasn't rabidly 'claiming it' everytime somebody zoned in. 
Or just shouting "Geos camped" every 20 mins or so just to make sure 
nobody got any ideas.

And these were usually solo 65ths, but occasionally mid 50s and once a 
group of 40s.

And I play late PST... (usually bumping into SoEs standard patch 
time...I can't count how many nites I've been dumped so they could 
patch... I don't see the logic of screwing the same segment of the 
player base a thousand times just because they are 'smaller' then the 
other segments... makes more sense to rotate it a bit so all players are 
impacted about the same) ...but I digress...so that's when the servers 
are least crowded.

FWIW... we actually did snag a one geo when the guy went afk for a few 
minutes (we'd been pulling spiders until then for silk) and he was just 
standing there at the ent to the geo cave...so we grabbed a focus gem 
that turned out to have a chipped diamond on it. (We wanted to see 
whether we could take them, what the geo fuss was all about, and to see 
if it was worth us coming back (hence my geo faction question a few days 
back).

Anyways we were pleasantly surprised that the fight was both quite easy, 
and the loot was quite spectacular.

In hindsight it looks like we snagged a particularly good drop, and I 
almost feel bad about it, almost.
