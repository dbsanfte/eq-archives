But the US is, undoubtably, the "centre" of the internet.

Maybe 33% of eq'ers come from outside the US, but it doesn't mean Europe
is closer. There are quite a few asian/australian players, for whom a
european server would be twice as bad (considering the packets are being
routed straight past VI in california and all the way to europe).

If anything having all the servers US based means that VI can expand on
various different ideas without excluding other people. What if you are
into PvP but live in Europe? Still gotta play on one of the PvP servers
in america as there wouldn't be the player base to host a euro one. What
if they started a RP server in europe? Well count everyone from
asia/australia out, and most of the americans would probably bitch too
(but hey, they're like that :p).

I dunno, I'd love to have an australian server, but I'm a PvP'er, and i
don't think I'd enjoy playing on a server with just 20 other aussie
PvP'ers.
