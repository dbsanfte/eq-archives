Yes. No (I agree that illegal does not mean wrong). Yes. Yes. Yes.
These convictions, for me, are based on my christian beliefs. That is
all I have to go on.

Those who are agnostic/atheist (sp?) will also have convictions, just
not based on a particular religion. However, there are particular
issues that can pretty much be considered universally objectionable. I
feel that deliberately doing something offensive to a very large group
of people is one of those.
