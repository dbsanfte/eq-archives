Please!  You want to talk about discrimination, talk about reconstruction,
talk about Rosa Parks, talk about the "colored" and "white" signs.  Even
trying to call today's situation discrimination is a slap in the face to
those who had to endure true racism.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
