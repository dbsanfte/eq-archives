Actually, the ST should NOT be the Ramp tank.  ST exists to take and 
hold aggro if the MT dies (or is mezzed, charmed, FD'd, banished, or any 
other of the myriad nasty things a mob can do to make the MT unable to 
hold aggro).  The ramp tank exists to take ramp damage.  If the ramp 
tank becomes the primary target, he loses ramp, which means someone 
-else- is ramp, probably a cleric, and there's no way to tell who until 
after he's been hit... which may kill him.

MT ST TT QT and so on should all NOT be Ramp, RT is an entirely separate 
job, best held if you can arrange it by a paladin using a DA proccing 
hammer.
