If you're going to pull and need Fading Memories, you should have maxed INT
(or be really close).

Also, at the high end of the scale (200+), you might find that the raw mana
addition is indeed marginal.  It may be changed, and is surely a lot easier
to check now with being able to see mana numbers, but there used to be a
diminishing return on mana above 200 INT.  I know there still is a
diminishing return on hp for above 200 STA.

Haste is pure convenience factor.  I wouldn't call it a necessity,
particularly for a bard, but it's always on without twisting in another
song that will probably be useless for your group anyway (cause you know
they're keeping their haste buffs).

Hmm.  It looks like utter crap.  Not even that good eh?   =)
