Not taking the time to redo this top to bottom (and for that matter its 
pretty good as is) I did want to note that the "starting at level 9" 
part is an artifact of the game from quite a while back; now SK, like 
other hybrids and pure casters and healers, get spells every level 
starting at level one.  Simply cutting the section I marked out will 
eliminate the discrepency without altering the meaning of the rest of 
the text.
