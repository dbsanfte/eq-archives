I seem to remember them working quite reliably, at least the Freeport-BBM
boat, the only one I used with any frequency pre Velious.  I never had any
trouble with it when I went to use it.  Later on, the Erud-Qeynos, and the
BBM-OOT-FV seemed to be quite reliable.  Since sometime before, or around
SOL, most of the boats have been pretty damned useless, with rare
exceptions.
