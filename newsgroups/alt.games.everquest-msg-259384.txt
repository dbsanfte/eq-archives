For the specific purpose of gaming I'd stick with the DSL,
not just because your overall 768up/down would comes out
to slightly better than the overall cablemodem picture
(twice the up plus 1/3rd the down equals 5/6th overall),
but also because 1) cablemodem is a shared wire where the
download rate will vary depending on how much porn your
neighbor is downloading.  And 2) (sort of related) the DSL
rates are better balanced (identical being as balanced as
you get) which means that you won't suffer the potential
cablemodem scenario of being able to see yourself getting
pummeled online with quick crisp clarity while being
hampered with a much slower upstream rate when you try
to send your commands to dodge or punch back.

It's probably also worth mentioning that DSL has better
"scale-ability".  If you stumble across a new game that
really needs the upstream bandwidth (like, maybe, if you
were the one hosting a game for 3-4 other players) then
you can add bandwidth to DSL in a fairly flexible (even
asymmetric) way, but your cablemodem upstream rate is
pretty much carved in stone.  I've also noticed that the
local cable company here in Bloomington has a specific
"no hosting" policy, partly because they know that it
would chew their shared bandwidth to the bone pretty
quickly.  With DSL you get what you pay for (and vice
versa) - if you want to host a game the DSL folks are
happy to sell you just as much bandwidth as you feel you
need to make it fly, and the feed that's coming into your
home is guaranteed to be just your traffic (unless perhaps
you have an unsecured wireless hub that your neighbors use
surreptitiously for their own web surfing, but that's a
whole different problem).
