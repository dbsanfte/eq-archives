It seems the only thing SOE keeps doing lately is this;
If you are an offensive class, you will be nerfed (Wizard and Monks). If you
are buffing class, you will have superior items and HP gear available and
possibly CH added to your arsenal. Wizards havent seen anything but nerfs
since SOE took over. I know Sony is losing money according to the stock
market, but nerfing all offensive classes so the game takes longer to
complete so that they earn more $$ isnt going to work.

I've just orded Shadowbane.
