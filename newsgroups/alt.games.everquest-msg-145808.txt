I killed the ancient giant the other day for a friend who needed jboots so i
picked him up with his 3250gp and we got a shadow rapier. Anyway when it
came down to the boots my friend messed up and pressed give before I did. So
now I (druid) have a pair of jboots which I cannot trade or drop.
So to my question is there anyway at all that i can give these boots to my
friend? he says he has seen it done but i have tried handing them to
merchants and other npc's but they just hand them back to me.
