They adjusted the mobs chance to pull free of a charm spell. Before the
nerf an enchanter with total domination AA maxed could nearly expect a
charm to hold the full duration.
But even now it is fairly easy. Enchanter/druid combos aren't there
without a reason. A charmed and snared pet still is a sight to behold.
:) Especially since it is hasted.
