Again, you don't seem to actually get it.

You used magician as an example...  let's just take magician as an example
since I recently completed the magician epic.

I got earth and water staffs in the *same day*.  I already had pegasus
cloak, but *four* days after I got my epic I replaced my sorely missed
pegasus cloak.

If this was the cleric epic I was speaking about, I'd have all that stuff
done, and be on a list to have my turn in in Sky scheduled for sometime
in 2003.

How does that seem better to you?

The new Ragefire camp doesn't require a cleric to have *any* of their epic
quest completed.  If I were interested in doing the cleric epic, that would
be the first part I did (and from what I hear that's a popular opinion)
because you already know *exactly* what the hang up is going to be.
