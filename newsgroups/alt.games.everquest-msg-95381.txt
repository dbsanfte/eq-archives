Networking is REAL important.

As a 51 enchanter (woot dinged last night baby. N00b Powa :) I have alot of
good friends that I know I can trust. After doing the Oasis LoIO etc sceen.
The ppl that you meet that are awsome to group with don't pass them up. ya
never know the person you group with now might have higher characters and if
ya entertain them they can and will hook you up.

I grouped with this warrior for about 2 weeks straight once. 35 to 40 ish.
I've since gotten to 51 and continue to be great friends with her. She has a
59 druid :) Not to mention the number of Clerics I've befriended. rule
number ONE as an enchanter. CLERICS are your best friend :) God knows how
many rezzes I've gotten from friends I've made heh :)

Just rambling on. Make friends. Use your /friend list. Mine is always full
heh.
