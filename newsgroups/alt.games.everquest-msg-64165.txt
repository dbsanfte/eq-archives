I'm guessing the person you replied to didn't put any text in his/her 
message, since it didn't even show up on my news server.

This new patch program is a steaming pile of shit. I can't think of 
another way to describe it. It's unstable, buggy, and chews up an ungodly 
amount of system resources when it's looking for updated files. 

I hope to hell the quality (or total lack thereof) of the patch program 
isn't an indicator of what's in store when I finally manage to get to 
play. My gut feeling tells me that Luclin was released about 3 months too 
soon, and the patch program and directx8.dll's that have been on Test for 
the past two weeks is only making it more apparent that Luclin was rushed.

I sure hope I'm wrong though.
