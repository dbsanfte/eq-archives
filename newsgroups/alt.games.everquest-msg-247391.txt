Not surprising that most of suggestions made for Shaman revolve around
"slow" themes, SOE apparently still thinks of us that way, too (which
prompts me to suggest "You've Lost that Loving Feeling" by The Righteous
Brothers).

I really like dank's suggestion the best: "Voodoo Chile" by Hendrix. Hendrix
was probably a Shaman himself.

And while we're on the topic of dead 60's music icons, Jim Morrison
frequently identified with Shamans and I'm sure this would have been his
character of choice. Clearly he would have been an Iksar.
