Except for a named Griffin in North Karana, nothing you might run into will
run faster than you do with Selo's.  In the following, when I say "trivial",
I mean that if you run through, paying any attention at all to what you are
doing, there is pretty much no danger at all.

1. East Commons.  Trivial.

2. West Commons.  Trivial.

3. Kithicor Forrest.  Trivial, although at night there are things there that
can Harm Touch.  They might be able to instantly kill you, so play it safe
and wait for daylight, although night is usually safe if you stay on the
edge of the zone.

You've got a choice of routes at this point.  Rivervale->Misty
Thicket->Runnyeye->Gorge->East Karana or Highhold->East Karana.

4. Highhold.  Nasty Orcs at the zone in, and nasty Gnolls at the zone out.
You can outrun them all, so in theory, it is easy to just run through,
ignoring any Orcs that aggro on you...however, it's easy to lost, and go in
circles, and do a Keystone Kops type of thing with the Orcs, getting hurt a
little more each time you run into the ones chasing you.  It used to be that
this was no problem, because both ends of the zone were heavily camped, but
with several expansions, there are better places to go, and the zone can be
empty.

5. Rivervale.  Assuming you haven't done something to piss the Halflings
off, trivial.

6. Misty Thicket.  Trivial.

7. Runnyeye.  Take a look at a map at www.eqatlas.com first, and it is
trivial.  Selo's doesn't work here...but the route through is short enough
you can make it through on the left over pulses.

8. Gorge.  Selo's works.  Check a map first so you don't get lost, and it
will be a trivial run through.

9. East Karana.  The things that could hurt you won't outrun you.

10. North Karana.  Watch out for the named Griffin.

11. West Karana.  Stick to the road and you'll be fine.  There are some
nasty things off the road (a nasty camp of Ogre Shaman that could cast some
nasty spells on you as you run by, for example).

12. Qeynos Hills.  It's a newbie zone, although there are a couple of nasty
named NPCs wandering around.

There's another route you can take, too.  East Freeport or East
Commons->North Ro->Oasis->South Ro->Innothule->Feerott->Rathe
Mountains->Lake Rathe->South Karana->North Karana->...

I'll let someone else describe the benefits and dangers of this route.
