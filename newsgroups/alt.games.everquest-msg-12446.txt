Not my point at all.  My point was that there isn't enough to learn.

An advantage, but it shouldn't decide the battle.  It should only
offer advantages in specific areas of combat that any opponet can over
come by using different tactics.

Not my point.  The fact that there are naked wizards indicates that
there needs to be more player skill involved not less.

Exactly my point.  But, PvP is still too easy.  I'd love to see
players have to choose thier attacks rather than just press autoattack
or chain caste debuffs and then nuke.

Sword fighting and spell casting should be more complicated.  Chosing
your moves as the fight progresses would be interesting and may work. 
The same for spell casting, rather than just casting spell X, y, and Z
make the player chose how to caste spells rather than what spells,
when.

Heh, I wish I could believe you.  PvP still doesn't require enough
knowledge of magic and sword fighting.  Make players chose how to use
that sword, make players chose how to caste their spells.

Not at all.  The PvP system isn't complicated enough or hard enough.

I thought gear wasn't that important?  You speak of learning how to
PvP? Yet you haven't described a single tactic.  In a straight up
fight something more than luck should determine the outcome.  PvP is
too simple.

Players would be better off having to learn how to use a weapon and
chosing the moves or action of the weapon rather than pressing one
autoattack key.  Spells should have several casting methods not just
one method. That was my point.

As it is now, gear is far too important and player skill isn't
important enough.
