Well, the vendor mining is a good excuse, but, even for that, I'd go PoK 
-> Misty -> Runny -> Gorge -> EK -> NK -> EK -> HHP.  That run across WK 
takes forever.  But, I suppose if your zone times are really bad, one 
less zone might be better than the run across WK, although I'd be 
surprised.  The top level of Runnyeye is pretty harmless, and a very 
short run, the gorge is the same.  I used to solo my warrior on the 
second and third levels of Runnyeye in the mid 20s.
