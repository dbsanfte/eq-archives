> How many people have played on FV?

  Yep, I have, and am enjoying it as well.  There are downsides, the
most severe of which is the low player population that makes it
difficult to impossible to find groups at times (exacerbated by
alignment restrictions), as well as the fact that the serverwide TLC
makes some quests difficult or impossible to complete, but otherwise
it's great.
