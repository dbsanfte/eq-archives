Not sure how you guys work it over there, but a citizen in Oz is only bound
by Civvy law. A serviceperson is bound by both Civvy Law and Military law,
and if you bother comparing the two you will soon discover civilians have it
easy, and rightly so.

But then again I am assuming Rule of Law here, which seems to be going out
of fashion in both our countries at the moment...
