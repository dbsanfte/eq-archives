Actually, why *don't* Wizards get something like DMF?  At least as far as
levitate and see invis goes?  We get levitate.  Except our levitate doesn't
last nearly as long, and requires a batwing.  We get see invis, except is
doesn't last nearly as long.

DMF just seems weird.  It gives *four* effects, all totally unrelated:
levitate, enduring breath, see invis, and poison resist.  And, for at least
three of those, they are better than the specialized spells of other classes
(longer lasting, and the lev and EB don't require components).

For Wizards, the spell I'd like to see would combine levitate, see invis,
and invis.  I pick those because they are things we can cast on others, and
often do have to cast all three of them.  E.g., when ferrying people to ToV,
it is common to port the to CS, and then lev/invis/see invis for the run to
SG, and then again on the other side when they enter WW.  Make it
componentless, like DMF, and make the lev and see invis last long.

Of course, they could simply cancel the MB nerf and fix the problem the
right way.  The problem is that there are mobs with very very expensive or
highly sought after loot that only have 32K HP: Vox, Naggy, and the Kunark
bosses.  Vox and Naggy aren't a problem because of the level limit.  That
leaves Kunark bosses.

Why not just move their loot to Velious mobs?
