nope, I was mistaken about Qwerty as his name.  Actually I think that is
what my teacher in high school told me, so appearantly I was told wrong.
Nevertheless, He did inadvertantly slow people down, although it was
important with the low technology of those mechanical typewriters at that
time to do what he did, today its totally unnecessary.   I had a long convo
with my dad who debunked this also, and we wasted time looking it up, etc.
The net result was that he didn't intend to slow people down, the developer
actually intended to speed people up, so developed the Qwerty system to
avoid collisions in the mechanisms.  Today, because the keyboard is
digitalized, the system is only used because its been grandfathered, and
should get overhauled to make typing faster.  Although at the time using
Qwerty was useful, in effect using the old grandfathered system is in fact
slowing down typing today and should be replaced.
I should of said inadvertantly instead of tried to slow down people typing
and I would of been more correct.  My semantics were incorrect.
I also talked at one point a year or two ago about EQ being in an inflated
economy.  The exact words I used was seemed ( thus wasn't saying absolutely
this was the case ) like we were in a constant inflation. I know believe we
are in constant deflation for EQ economy.  The platinum is getting stronger
and stronger as time goes on, and allows you to buy better and better stuff.
The main reasons for this is that items do not leave the economy normally
( few rare instances where they do), and new items are constantly being put
into the economy ( both better items that are from new expansions and old
"new" items that just dropped off a named).  Deflation and Inflation is
generally undersired in Economic systems, and is usually attempted to be
controlled to some degree.  Generally your better off holding platinum for
the long term in EQ because it will buy you more in the future than it will
right now.  One instance where this is not true is if you don't have the
basic equipment to go adventuring, thus limiting your income.   I've looked
at several configurations on buying new items, and in some instances I could
spend 10's of thousands of plat just to get a few points in a few needed
stats.  Definitely not worth wasting plat for a few points.
