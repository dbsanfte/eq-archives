It's very possible that the bard has a really crappy swim skill.  I never 
swim anymore unless in indoor zones.  Bards get Selos Song of Travel at 
51, selos, lev, and invis.  It makes traveling across water trivial.
That said, I have not had anyone outswim me for a long, long time.  
Spending literally days in pre-nerf SG probably has a lot to do with that.
