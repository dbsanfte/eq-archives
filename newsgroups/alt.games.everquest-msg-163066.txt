Pretty much, but if I'd said 200pp it would have been
more money than I *have* for my main. (Having just
bought an acrylia studded cloak for ~850pp, and level
44 approaches, with all that implies for a cleric. Spells
and peridots.)

One of my main goals is to cut downtime, as
downtime when soloing my cleric really bites...
1 minute of root/nuke followed by 15 mins
medding gets old really quickly. It looks like
Iksar are best in reducing downtime due to regen,
so I've started up an Iksar. Downtime to date is
much, much better - not zero, but probably
equal time to combat, and that mainly because
I'm still meleeing sometimes to keep my pet alive.

I figure without the regen I'd be spending double
(or more) the time medding, so exp-wise it's a
good deal.

I've also grouped a little bit - with other iksar, as
would be expected at low levels, so the penalty
hasn't mattered much.

Why are Gnomes so low on your list? I'd heard
they get an exp bonus. Would think that would
put them above humans, at least.

BTW, the main thing that worries me faction-wise
is spell research. I read somewhere of a place where you
could buy "practice" components for spell research, with
one NPC for "good" races and another for "evil" races.
Since Iksar are hated by both, I'm worried that I'll have
to burn through real components instead. Or is one or the
other a neutral con to an Iksar?
