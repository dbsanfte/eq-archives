Not a globally changing idea, just a new zone idea.

Make a free zone (like Paineel), just a smallish one, a newbie zone
basically. I was thinking of it as an elf colony somewhere on Antonica
(but Odus would work too, or maybe the Loping Plains). Then, a few
weeks later, some new evil race (or maybe an older one like Shissar)
actually permanently takes over Felwithe and Kelethin. Both cities
become high level dungeon type zones, but their layout doesn't
actually change.

Might be a neat feeling to be fighting monsters in towns you've been
used to wandering around freely in for three years.

*shrug* just a half baked thought.
