I wasn't trying to change anyone's opinion on anything. I was just giving
mine. I have read on the main EQ boards a post by Absor saying the gameplay
did not unfold how they had intendedbut I dont have the link. I'm not trying
to rag on people who play on the blue servers. It's fairly obvious that most
people prefer PvE.

Sorry about the remark about you not using your head, I think that your
tailoring guide is very good!
