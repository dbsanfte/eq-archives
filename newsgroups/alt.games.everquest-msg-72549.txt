DB wizards aren't needed in VP as nothing there is DB-able.
If you're able to do ToV, stay there.  Seriously, VP is a stupid waste
of time.  Yes, Phara Dar's rare and fuck drops are semi-decent.  But
for the time invested it's crap.

With 24 to 30 on the first VP trip, you should be able to drop
Silverwing (aka, Silvergimp).  But Hoshkar will be your daddy unless
out of 30, there's 15 wizards.

Silverwing and Hoshkars are roamers, you usually have to clear these
two to get to the other four (as pulling the other four becomes
somewhat tricky with roaming see invis, quarter of the zone aggro
range dragons).

The guardian wurms in VP come in three flavors (you decide how tough
they are):

1.  550ers.  These are the "normal" wurms.  They double for 550, have
Naggy (or Vox) AoE which is either fire or cold based and will strip a
buff.  These are the easy ones.

2.  Splitters.  These are annoying as fuck wurms.  Once you kill them,
they split into two wurms immediately.  So you get three wurms for the
price of one.  

3.  1550ers.  These are the worst of the bunch (especially if it comes
with a dragon).  They double for 1550 per pop generally don't have any
AoEs (thank god) but can drop a caster in a single round.  That means
one complete heal on a tank without some warrior occupying it would
mean Cleric DT.

And you have no idea which is which until you pull it.

(Hmmm, why do I think I missed one type of wurm...)

>Do they drop enough to make them worth farming?  

Wurms only load high level Kunark spells, nothing else.  And they
kinda suck for exp grinds.

All mobs in VP except for the dragons are on a 2 minute spawn timer
(yes, that's not a typo, that's 120 seconds).

All drakes see invis.
Some wurms see invis.
No raptors see invis.
All dragons see invis (but rogue hide/sneak might work).

If you can do ToV, you don't need warrior epics, it would be a down
grade.

Keep in mind:  Once you zone into VP, you are either zoning out
through Druushk's zone out pad (to E Freeport) or Phara Dar's zone out
pad (Plane of Air).  You can't gate, TL or port out.  Only other way
out is to die.

As a side note:  All critters in VP are level 60 except for the
dragons and ONE raptor.  I have no idea what that raptor is about, but
he's level 61/62--has anyone bothered to kill this one?
