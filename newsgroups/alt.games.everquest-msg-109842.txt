I have heard from a few people that the new portals are going to be at the
docks in OOT and TD, and suspicion is that Verant are doing away with, or
modifying the boats that sail these seas.

I can remember as a newbie first setting foot on the Stormbreaker and
getting a real thrill of actually journeying to another continent!
I can also remember as a newbie setting foot again on the Stormbreaker and
realising what a pain in the ass this was gonna be (actually it was sitting
at the docks waiting that I realised this).

I think that the boat journeys do add something to the game, even though I
havent used one in quite a while now.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to what could be done to improve this
mode of transport?

My suggestions are to add a gambling area to each of these boats, where you
can engage in games of chance with PCs and/or NPCs for real plat/items.
Also the addition of boat-hire merchants at the docks in these areas, where
you can hire boats similar to the row-boats but with the ability to zone.
These boats can be graded by speed and priced accordingly.

Any other suggestions? Or does everyone just think the boats suck?

SAVE OUR BOATS!!
