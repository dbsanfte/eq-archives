I'm feeling I should be doing the same soon,
every time I log I know I'm going to be bored in game,
and I still see the people that play 16 hours a day online all the time.
I've been playing real Rpg's recently ( BG2 ) and I'm having way more fun
then
in LevelQuest / EverCamp

Btw, many people I know that quit came back 3 weeks later,
best way to quit is delete your chars cancel account and throw away
the Cd.   ;)
