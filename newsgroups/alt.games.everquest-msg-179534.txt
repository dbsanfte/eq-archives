So it'd take what?  5 weeks tops to get a click-stick or two on a
guild's clerics?  And by then they're already pharming HoT (or maybe
Kael if resist gear is slow in accumulating)?  Anyway, it looks like
Jazz's 6 week estimate for things sorting themselves right back
where they were might be pretty conservative for guilds full of
knowledgeable 40+ hour/week players.
