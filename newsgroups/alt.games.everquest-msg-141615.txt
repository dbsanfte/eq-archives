You can get ES Vambraces cheaper than that spell, it's quite effective for
farming greens.  I can't argue with wanting a full spell book, I'd like that
too, but I have resigned myself to that not happening, as Levitation,
Everlasting Breath, and Greater Remove Curse seem like they are quite
unlikely to happen, and no way in hell would I pay the prices people ask for
them.  If I get that kind of cash, I'll save it and some more, and get
Torpor.
