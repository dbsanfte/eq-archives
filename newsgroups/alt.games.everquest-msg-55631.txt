Defense and Offense both cap at 5 times level (oddly, not times level plus one)
Defense is the important one, really, although there's no reason not to let
offense go up too.

Weapon cap for priest classes is 4*(level + 1), casters have it even worse
at 3*(level + 1)  Again, this isn't a critically important skill, unlike
defense.

Caps at 75, and hard to see how it isn't there already, seemed to go up
real easy.  Key to both this and defense is to get hit.

Here's what I do, snare and DD a mob till its down to about 1/3rd, then
slap on a DOT, DS yourself, and go toe to toe till it runs... unless it gets
me down to 2/5ths hp or so, when I back the heck off and -make- it run
with another nuke.  This isn't the most efficient way to kill stuff, perhaps,
particularly not as you level up and mob damage gets -much- higher
than your DS damage back, but it is a good way to get some defense
and dodge skills, and its a change of pace from just nuking em to death.
