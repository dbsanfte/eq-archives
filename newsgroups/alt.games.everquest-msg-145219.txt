2 rangers tanking because you were getting adds, or?

I MA'd a HoT raid for about 5 hours a while back, including the named (a
pickup raid of some of my guild, and lots of other guild lower level
people). We didnt have many clerics (3-4?) and 1 druid (oh and 1 shaman.. me
heh) but I didnt die once, and we had no wipeouts.

I dont think its a *huge* difference between monks and rangers in tanking
ability.. I've seen a rogue tank HoT stuff heh

Hopefully i can carry it further someday and tank doze too :)
