Well, there is a New Plane of Hate (hateB), they did some re-adjusting
the Monk Mitigation / avoidance in favor of the player. Those are the
ones that stand out in my head.
Comming up are, changes in Group exp to be benificial to the group, a
new zone in the lake of Ill Omen, and..... In the planes of power they
are going to do away with some flag requirements to get to tier 2
zones and just use level requirements.
