I did BW from 51-54 at giant fort.  There is also a small ruin with undead
mobs that can be single pulled and faily easy and there are no roaming mobs
to worry about.  If you are looking at the ramp the giant fort, it is to the
right a little ways.

I also did entrace/exit to Chardok, but it was often camped.  Around 54 I
moved to SF with my cleric/monk combo and exp'd there while collecting
shards.
