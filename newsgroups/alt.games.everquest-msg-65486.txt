It is so amazing to see responses that misinterpret the original post as
much as this.  Read it again!  Maybe it's my fault in the original post but
MY GUILD has nothing to do with any lawsuits.   If you go the Everlore and

I don't mind what Verant has done but I can't help sharing the frustration
all  my friends having upgrade troubles now.
