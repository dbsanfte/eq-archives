I am very sorry for you and for your friend.  My older brother (1 year older
than I am) died of it at the age of 26 back in 1994.  He, a cousin of ours,
and I were about as close as possible, so I have a good idea how you might
feel.  I have a substantial vocabulary, but I cannot think of any other word
that evokes such raw emotion in me as "Leukemia"

I have been a registered candidate to donate marrow since that time.  I have
apparently never come up as a match, but I will never refuse if I do happen
to be contacted.  Donating is painful, but from what I saw my brother
endure, it's a cakewalk compared to the disease itself.
