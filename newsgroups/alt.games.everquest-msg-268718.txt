Ebik's quest isn't necessary to leave the island. The only 'necessary
quests are to talk to Gaven and choose a basic class and to talk to the
ambassador and then the Duke to leave. However, doing *all* the quests and
gaining as much experience as possible (including tradeskills if you're
going to do any) is *very* much recommended. Not only will you be geared
better but you'll know the game much better.
