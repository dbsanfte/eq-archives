Regarding attacking a soulbinder to raise skills..... DON'T do it to work on
melee skills; they not only won't give you any skill-ups since they con
green, but they also hit back occasionally, and do a fairly good bit of dmg
when they hit.

They're only good for 3 things: Binding souls, spellcasting skill-ups, and
using up Magician-summoned arrows or throwing knives if you need the space
its taking up and would rather use it up than destroy it. (Since I don't
think you can get Archery or Throwing skill-ups from green mobs,
either.....)
