See, Fear is too much of a wuss to take a stand against his followers
invading his area until they kill his main minions. Hate is, at least,
consistent enough to turn against his children should we invade his
realm, and only reward us with phat lewts if our hate should prove as
strong than his, enabling  us to kill him for a while (if any of us
had stronger hate than him, they'd be the god instead of Inny). 
However, after accomplishing something like this, he can't really
trust those followers to have faith in him the way they used to, so
bye bye faction.
