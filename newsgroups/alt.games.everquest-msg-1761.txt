This is one of the funnest things in game for me =)

Its like a big surge of adrenalin (sp?) when your crossing =)  I've seen a
few undead right on the north zone walls before, that is quite scarry =)

One time I wanted to see if I could follow the path through the forest, at
night, with no sow =)   Got about haflway then a ton of undead jumped me, I
ran and ran, and ended up at this house where I was promtply double hit for
175 each time, and died =)
