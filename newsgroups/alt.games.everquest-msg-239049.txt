We're going to have to agree to disagree, Ben.  I'm of the opinion that Sony
is far worse for nerfing both items and classes.  I also question what you
said about Sanya; the quotes made in her posts weren't ABOUT DAOC, they were
about EQ - which tells me that you didn't read her comments fully.  If
you're going to accuse her of being false, be prepared to cite.  And if
you're going to say that she's worse than her EQ counterparts about saying
one thing and doing another, I'll refer you to any number of EQ class
boards - with a cite on Absor lies on every page.
