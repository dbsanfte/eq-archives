Seems odd, I am running with an Athlon XP 3200+ and 1GB of dual channel 
PC3200 ram, and a 9800 Pro with 128MB, and only ever see any lag if there 
are a whole lot of people around, or I've had EQ2 up and running for a long 
time (overnight in trader mode for instance, I suspect some memory leak 
issues there).  I have my settings at balanced, the default that was set 
when I installed the game.
