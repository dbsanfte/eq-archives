Got a copy of Word of Vigor last night, imagine my surprise when I
saw the 750 mana sticker on it!  OK, so it turns out its not just a
group
Invigor as I'd assumed, but an upgrade to the group heal line, that
happens
to include group invigor.  After some research, I wish I'd been right:

Assuming for the sake of arguement a full group with everyone
sufficiently
damaged to absorb the full value of the heal:

Word of Healing: 500 HP per, 600 mana cost, for 5 HP per mana spent
Word of Vigor: 590 HP per, 750 mana cost, makes 4.72 HP per mana
Word of Vigor: 620 HP per, 750 mana cost, makes 4.96 HP per mana
Heroic Bond: 360 HP per, 420 mana cost, makes  7 hp per mana!
Word of Health: 100 HP per, 180 mana cost, all of 3.3333HP per mana

Just a side note: Word of Health off my greaves, undefined HP per mana
(can't divide by zero)

The two Vigor stats are at lowest level and at highest level.  Vigor
also includes a stamina boost, but in non underwater situations I
very rarely get called on to zing anymore anyway.

Now if you are in a very serious AOE damage situation, I imagine
the Vigor approach has an advantage as you see more healing
in a short time.

On the other hand, my assumption that everyone is sufficiently damaged
to absorb the whole value of the heal is likely to be false much of the
time with Vigor, while the already more efficient Heroic Bond approach
also is more likely to get fully utilized, keeping a near 7 hp per mana
ratio while Vigor's number might be plummeting towards 3 or 2 per.

This assumption isn't helped by the fact that whenever I'm FM or
forced to stand due to "aggro when you sit" mobs, but mobs are
otherwise under control, I'm chain casting word of health off my
greaves, so we aren't seeing the gradual degrade of people from
smaller AOEs and incedental "one hit" aggros.

Heroic Bond also has the benefit of refreshing everyone's Heroism, so
you won't have to stop and mem HB and waste mana casting it when
its not needed as a heal, and I suspect (although I have no evidence
as yet) that it aggros less, like the old days where we'd use Center
as a heal rather than (what was it, Healing?)

PS: As an aside, be wary of range here.  I lost my chanter last night
when I decided on Word of Vigor instead of Remedy... turns out
he, and only he, was out of Vigor range when it went off.  Worst
part is, although everyone was somewhat damaged, I'm sure they
all would have lived, it was the chanter I was trying to save!
