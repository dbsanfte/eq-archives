I've been playing for a fair while now and have only just noticed
this. I'm getting a slight little jerk in the display as I move along
or pan around. At first I thought it was intentional as it coincided
with the footsteps sound and I thought maybe they are trying to give
it a kind of "bob" as you walk along.

But it also happens if i'm standing still and just panning around.
It's most noticeable if I go into a small room and stand still and pan
the view around 360 degrees. As I move the view around it will be
smooth for about 20 or so degrees, then it will "jerk" ahead a slight
amount. It's very consistent, if I stand there constantly panning
around the room I will get this slight little jerky movement about
every second.

It's noticeable too just walking along, but barely. You really need to
be near something close or looking down at the ground to notice it.

Anyone got any ideas ?

System is Athlon 2G, 512 ram, 64m radeon 9000, winXP. Have no other
problems with other 3D games or apps. It's not a game stopping
problem, in fact it has taken me 20 days of play to even notice it :)
