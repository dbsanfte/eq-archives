No idea on a software one.  But if it's just one character, post your 
race/class here and I bet a bunch of people will have suggestions.

Here are some:
Angwen
Brendothi
Chemid
Fiya
Jubb
Matra
Niplie
Rendon
Sren
Tobel
Vika
Zent

Or just listen to your favorite song and take the first part of one word 
and the last part of another word together, change a vowel or two, then 
shorten it enough that your friends can type it.

My plan is to use 4 letter names for all my new characters so my friends 
have less to type.  If you start the name with V or Z or X it's less 
likely to get refused by the filter since few people start names with 
those letters.
