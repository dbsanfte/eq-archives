Oof, well, things MIGHT hurry themselves along, partly my fault, partly
just bad luck.  I posted the proposal on alt.config just to get feedback
and any criticism from them on the formatting. However, I'm informed that
there is a "hijacker" there...ie, someone seeing what groups folks want to
create and then rushing to create them before the interested party can. I
don't really know what that MEANS...can they ruin it somehow? I'm not
sure.

But as for waiting a month or two...well, I won't be playign in a month or
two, so it'd be up to someone else then. :) I figured i'd just DO this
thing since folks kept talking about it and no one was actually DOING it.
Yes yes, you may all pat me on the back now.  :P
