Funk it, forget the boat and get yourself a port to Tox forest.  Might
be kinda hard to do from qyenos, but you should find a few selling
ports in North K soon enough.

If I remember correctly, Paineel is devoted to Cazic-thule.  Provided
you can get your fatties into the front door, the ogres might be able
to buy/sell/bank there.  If nothing else, just killing stuff in the
Warrens will raise paineel guard faction, perhaps there's some quests
to work at from there.
