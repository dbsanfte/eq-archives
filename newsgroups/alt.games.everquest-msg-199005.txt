I just noticed this last night (hadn't logged on the magician for a while
apparently).  I don't actually use a pet window, even on my magician, but
instead use it as a game timer.  Alt-F1 brings it back up, and it never
disappears on a non-pet class or on a pet class as long as you don't lose a
pet.

It's annoying, but very minor.  Some people might even prefer it that way,
but I certainly hope there is or will be an option to choose which behavior
it exhibits.
