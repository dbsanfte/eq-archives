Didn't say anything about making the MOVIE available through purchase
of action figures. We were talking about, in our example, making a
"making of" disc available through purchase of action figures, and
only a limited supply free to those who don't purchase anything (The
"random draw" to bring the example closer to the selective application
to get into the beta).
