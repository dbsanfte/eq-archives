On a side note here: I have never even blurted out a verbal
explicative accidentally, so I don't put much weight in the "speaking
before I could think" argument, either. Someone once in a chatroom was
whining about how she was fired from a grocery store for shouting
"FUCK!" when she dropped a can on her foot in front of a holiday-rush
crowd. She insisted that it wasn't her fault and she shouldn't have
gotten fired for it. Sorry, if your habits are such that shouting
explicatives is a reflex, you need to grow up. Professing that you
aren't at fault because it was a reflex is just a cop-out excuse. Even
exercising the slightest amount of self-control can prevent such
so-called "slips". Making excuses is simply an attempt to justify not
bothering with such self-control.
