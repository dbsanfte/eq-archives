While the one time I went on a plane raid we did the corpse shuffle,
it seems to me that COTH was tailor made for this, save all that mana
from rebuffing everyone, get the mana pumps pounding and you
should be able to get from one isle to the next in under 15 minutes.

Alternately, take a party no larger than what is it, 24?
