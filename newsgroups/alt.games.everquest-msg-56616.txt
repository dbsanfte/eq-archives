Idiot warriors are easily outtaunted.  And admittedly there are plenty
of idiots in this game.

A compentent warrior will lose aggro only when he chooses to lose
aggro.

There's only two factors at high end raids that makes this game even
remotely challenging:  Mob positioning and aggro management.  Warriors
who routinely raid end game mobs understand aggro management (or they
don't raid much since they'll be dead a lot).  Find one of these
warriors and try and steal aggro from them when they decide they don't
want to give it up.

You'll find the task very difficult if not impossible.
