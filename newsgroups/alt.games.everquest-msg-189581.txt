Yep, at level 49 they can regen mana faster than C3, and they don't have to
go to the expense or inconvenience of going to a "C3 outlet" to get it.
Necros can also work on the HP issue by focusing on HP gear and the proper
AA's.

But at level 49 magicians also get an awesome mana regen capability based on
the fact that the level 49 Earth pet (and lvl 50 Monster Summoning) pet can
be reclaimed for more mana than it cost to cast them.
