But *waaaaaay* too much work to try and factor leveling into it, and
cutting it off at say, 55, can reduce the overall flexibility of a class
who might get some incredibly powerful and class definining ability later
on. Too many different increments for too many different classes...rogues
would jump several ranks in melee damage from 9 to 10, but nobody else
does, as an example. If you want to make a lower level list, be my guest :)
