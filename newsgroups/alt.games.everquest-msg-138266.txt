Last night in Shadowhaven, some pitiful soul was oocing for help.  I gave
her every str buff I could, no go.  Levitate, no go.  She was bound in WFP,
and silly me, I didn't think to rebind her, and duel.  So a cleric comes
along, cleric buffs her up, I buff her up, and enchanter tosses runes on
her.  Cleric duel, and casts his DD knockback spell on her until she is
knocked across the zone line.  It was really quite amusing.
