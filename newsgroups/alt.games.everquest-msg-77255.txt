When you registered, it didn't make any changes on your own
computer, instead it set a flag on your account (stored on
VERANT's computers) saying, "so-and-so is now enabled to play
these expansions".

So if you log on to your EQ account (using your username and
password, which I presume you still remember) from any computer, 
anywhere, that has any copy of Everquest installed on it, 
you'll be enabled to run Kunark and any other expansion 
you've enabled your account for.

So you're welcome to get a new computer and install a fresh
copy (*anyone's* copy) of Everquest onto it, then log on
and start playing.

The only catch is that if the copy you buy/borrow to make
the fresh installation doesn't have the Kunark files, they
won't be there for you to zone into.  But most likely, the
patcher may well attempt to download the "missing" files for
you, as it would for any file that it thought you had but it
couldn't find on the disk.

If nothing else, find someone who already has EQ + Kunark
installed on their computer, and then copy their entire EQ
directory over to your new computer (using a CD-ROM or
direct network connection -- this would be insane via floppies).
This is perfectly kosher, and will work just fine.
