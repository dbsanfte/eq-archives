It's stupid, but with proper preparation, there is not much danger of losing
it to a ninja looter.

For example, when we killed Ragefire a while ago... the group with the cleric
doing the quest in it had a level 60 Ranger, a pair of level 60 Rogues, a
level 59 warrior and a level 58 wizard.    We told him if his group didn't get
the kill, maybe he didn't deserve the epic. ; )
