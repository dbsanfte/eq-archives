Thank you, my friend.  I think I've quickly adjusted to the new setting
and figured out who the bad people are apart from the good.  No message
group is complete without at least one.  Actually, if you were to ask
around from where we, the new people, are from you might find some
people have negative things to say of me here and there (not that I'm
proud of them or like to look back on them).  I wasn't calling you a
smart ass and what not.  XD

My thick skin is still growing, I think, though I think over time I may
have grown a thick skull.  As long as I have people like Ulujain around
I'll continue learning.

By the way, I think my quotes haven't been working the last few times!
=(
