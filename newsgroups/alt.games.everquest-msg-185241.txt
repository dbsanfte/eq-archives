You got a point John, I don't think EQ is the game for the OP.  Or maybe 
  enchanter isn't the right fit for him/her.  You have to have a certain 
mentality to really get into playing EQ.  You have to be determined to 
find what you need or you'll never find it.  Nothing in EQ that is easy 
to get is worth keeping.  EQ is a difficult game to learn and until you 
learn certain things about game play and find all the resources on the 
net, it's 10 times more difficult.
