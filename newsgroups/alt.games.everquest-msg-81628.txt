I teamed up with a beastlord the other day.  We had an enchanter, a wizard,
and a beastlord in our group... all about level 15.  The beastlord was the tank,
obviously.

As an enchanter, mez was nearly useless, because the beastlord's pet either
got taunted off, I think, to another mob (which I was trying to mez) or the pet wasn't
targeted to the same mob that the beastlord was tanking.  I don't know which or
if maybe both.

If a beastlord is tanking, he can't really see what his pet is doing.  And if the pet is able
to be taunted, then this would seem to mess up the group-playability for beastlords.

Anyone else have this same experience?  Are there any strategies that work better?
