Well, I'm only a L55 with Run2, so with Instrument of Nife up I seem
to about match an equal level/gear Warrior for DPS vs. undead.  I'm
a long way from being able to crush the basement of KC solo.  :)

Heh, the mere presence of a mezzer implies nothing about competence,
in my experience.  Also, keep in mind that before LDoN I rarely
pulled for groups, and I've learned that in tight quarters there's
more to pulling than just dragging mob(s) back to camp.  It's not
rocket science, but my positioning of mobs seems to have a large
impact on how well the rest of the group performs, especially in
the first few seconds after engagement of a multi-pull when I'm
getting beat on my multiple unslowed mobs.  Some folks do quite
well even if I don't position the mobs all that well, others can't
seem to target anything that isn't presented to them just right
(or, for melees, can't get themselves into melee range when others
are already crowding around the target).  Prior to this it never
occurred to me that those sorts of details would matter so much
when fighting mobs that are, essentially, xp-grind fodder.

Hmmm, so the point of the ramble is that for my groups so far
single pulls have worked best, partly due to decidedly non-uber
gear, and partly due to the less than stellar skills of the
players (including my still improving pulling skills).
