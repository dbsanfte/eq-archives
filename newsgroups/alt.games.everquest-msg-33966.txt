What is EB?

Well maybe there is lot's of druids in CS, never checked what class
people where, many where anon by the way, part of the trip was trying
to get as far as possible alone, and i got to SS without no help,
monsun who killed ziglark did that because he wanted to not because i
asked him, and i do not know him, this was the first time i met him.

Grouping and getting a teleport in is of course an option, but i don't
know any wizards or druids that high, and to use there services i
would like to pay for it, and i can imagine that a port or tp into CS
is not cheap.
