I paid 500pp for this spell in the Bazaar as it seemed an uncommon
drop (many of our proper guild Shaman never bothered with it and now
I see why, heh) as I was under the impression it would stack with
normal buffs [*] but alas it doesn't stack to very much effect at
all.

HoS overwrites the STR component, Alacrity overwrites the haste
component and I imagine Guardian would overwrite the AC buff although
I never tested this aspect.

[*] Previous pet caster experience was with my Necro and their pet
buffs are very much worth it.
