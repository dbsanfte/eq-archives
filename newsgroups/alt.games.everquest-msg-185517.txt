Greetings all! Im hoping that in the vast wilderness that is A.G.E there is
someone that can enlighten me as to where the tradeskill item, Essence of
Moonlight, can be found. My wife, bless her, has consented to attempt to
make some Imbued Mithril Chain armor for my newb HE Cleric, and shes given
me a grocery list of things that I need to get for making the temper.
Morning Dew is easy, with my druid. Just sit around G-fay long enough and
Ill have plenty of that. Swirling mist is a little harder, but at least I
know where to get them ( Twilight sea, and najena Ive heard ). Essence of
Moonlight however has me stumped.

If anyone knows where I could find this elusive item I would be grateful!
