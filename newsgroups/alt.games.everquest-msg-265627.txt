That's because the system that they just put into place is, near as I
can tell, the one they've been shooting for.  What we've had before now
was just a place holder.  Granted, they could have put it in a
*leeeetle* earlier, IMO, but it isn't just random change.

I read what Ben wrote, and it confused me at first, until I started
substituting "guild" or "coalition" for "social structure" in his message.

Well, since this is what they've been telling us tradeskills will be
like for a while now, I hope that their infrastructure can handle it!

You're not the only one chomping at the bit.  I've been in a holding
pattern at Artisan level 8 waiting to get back in and push through some
Outfitter levels.  Lack of tradeskill devices and fuel have made that a
wee bit difficult.  I'm hoping to get through several levels, tonight.
