Alright, I've been saving for  Jaundiced Bone Bracer for 8 months.. I'm a
level 52 shaman, I have 12k.  My next statement might get flamed, but I'm
saying it anyway.  I have absolutely no luck in groups with items and rolls.
Two Froglok Tunics dropped the other day in a group, I got a 1 on one of the
rolls and a 117 on the other one.  A melee won each time.. thing would have
replaced my crystallized shadow tunic anytime.  Anyways, is there anywhere I
can solo to make money quickly?  I do Ice Giants in Permafrost, and thats
decent, but I was looking for something more.  12k in 8 months is a bit
rediculus.  So, suggestions?  I also have a 46 enchanter, if anyone can
think of a good strategy him to solo or for the both of them to work
together (two accounts).
