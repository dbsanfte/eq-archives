If they ask for the whole spiel about sex, yes.  In all cases I've
encountered, or discussed with others, the first questions are either along
the lines of "where did I come from" or, for those children who know a
pregnant woman "how did that baby get there."  Telling them that Mom's have
a special place inside their bodies that's just for growing a baby is
usually enough at this point.  AS they ask more detailed questions you
provide honest, factual answers to their questions.  IF you get through how
the baby grows, and how the baby comes out, and that Mom and Dad each supply
a part of the cells that make a baby, and that Moms and Dads bodies are
built to work together in getting the cells there, tell them the actual
activities involving the penis and vagina -- it's only biology.

The whole spiel about sexually transmitted aids is not that intensive
either.  One person is infected During intercourse fluids are exchanged --
with a side note that this is special fluid and not blood or saliva.  This
means that the other person can get the virus (HIV) that leads to AIDS. Good
time for a note on abstinence and safe sex here too.

I'm curious as to just what it is about sexual reproduction that you find so
complex or involved that children shouldn't know about it or can't
understand it.
