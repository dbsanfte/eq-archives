Revenge Of The Vera Gemini
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

You're boned like a saint
With the consciousness of a snake

You're the kind of girl
I'd like to find
Face like an angel
But you're boned like the devil

Your eyes have shifted from me
Everyone saw what you did
You have slipped from beneath me
Like a false and nervous squid

Oh no more horses horses
We're gonna swim like a fish
Into the hole, in which you planned to ditch me
My lovely Vera Marie

You planned to leave me cold
But you'll never get your wish
On the 24th of May
I'll gather up your reins

You filled me with a vengeance
And you touched me with your breath
I'm gonna pull you from this dance
You're gonna ride so easily

Oh no more horses horses
We're gonna swim like a fish
Into the hole, in which you planned to ditch me
My lovely Vera Marie

I was your victim
I was well deceived
Hell's built on regret
But I love your naked neck

And evil lies that you told me
Could make me believe your two-faced
Because two faces have you
And they're both gonna go

Oh no more horses horses
We're gonna swim like a fish
Into the hole, in which you planned to ditch me
My lovely Vera Gemini
