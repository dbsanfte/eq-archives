The difference between these two is what happens after another
command. 

If you /pet sit, then /pet attack the pet will have NO command after
the fight.  However, from a /pet guard here, then a /pet attack, the
pet will go back to the guard spot after the fight.

> /pet follow and /pet guard me

/pet guard me is a good way to have the pet jump on anything that
doesn't like you...  I killed the hotkey for this one straight a way
and rely on /pet follow and /pet guard here much more.

If you or he are getting wacked, you really can't get him to back off.
