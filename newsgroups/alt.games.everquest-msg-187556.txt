Absolutely correct. Contact your ISP and ask them to refuse USENET
traffic from alt.net. Won't help with the people who reply, but will
kill a very large chunk of USENET trolls, the prophet included.

If enough ISPs refuse to carry alt.net NNTP traffic, alt.net will become
a small NNTP intranet and cease to be a problem to the rest of the
world.
