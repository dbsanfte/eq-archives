What annoys me the most is that the collection quests fill up my quest
journal. Currently, I have about thirty collections and this forces me to
try and rush-collect, i.e., buy the remaining one or two items in a
collection to free up slots. If I had a separate collection journal, I would
just let the collections rest there until I came upon the missing item by
chance or was offered a good deal.

And the way the market is at the moment, most collections contain items that
are typically sold for much more than the collection reward is worth. If I
recall correctly, I was rewarded about 20 silver for a plain spider
collection, but you often see plain spiders cost more than that.
Fortunately, I only paid 10 silver for the gray spider I needed, but still,
it seems like an awful lot of trouble for very little.

As things are, I'm tempted to never start another collection and simply sell
the items on the market. But then again, I'm in it for the fun of it, not to
rip off other players, and I still hope one day to get a really worthwhile
collection reward.
