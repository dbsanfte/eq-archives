Well, where I was sort of heading with this was that maybe increased mapping 
or geographical "awareness" skills could be quest rewards for certain 
classes.

I know I've seen that kind of thing connected to gear upgrades in some 
FPS's, but I don't at the moment recall seeing it in any RPGs.  (And I know 
after saying this someone's going to point out one that's glaringly 
obvious.)
