This would be good for tailors, camp the spiders and you can collect lots of
Crystalline Silk which is a little easier to skill up on than Wu's.  Might
be good to have your chanter friend here.

Also check out Tenebrous, with both of you, you would be fine there.  A lot
of Acrylia drops there and she will need that for tailoring from 150-200
aprx.

You might also try the Drachnids right outside of the tunnel in Fironia Vie
that leads to Dreadlands (I think) Its the tunnel that has the POK book in
it.  They drop a lot of silk and would be good exp at your level.

Not much for tailors, but TOFS is also fun at this level, each floor gets a
little tougher.

Droga is also good, but you definately want the chanter with you.
