I'm fascinated by this discussion, but forgive me for butting in with a
newbie question, or request for clarification, if you will:

1. The scout targets the mob and presses "H".
2. The tank targets the scout and calls /assist
3. The tank is now targeting the hailed mob and can begin to taunt.

Is this correct?

I'm asking because I'm a guardian myself and have never really used the
/assist command.

I've often wondered why my group members keep hailing the enemy, but now I
know :-)
