The old face look is linked to the face tag in /facepick. Change the
hair, hair color, eye color and your old face will stay the same.
Change the face (basically, the eyebrow and lip markings) and the old
face will change with it. If you're geeky about it like I am, you'll
notice that the new face markings are very similar to the old face
markings of each particular face (I am old face brunette with marked
eyebrows and red lips, and new face with marked eyebrows, red lips,
and white hair).

Hitting the random face generator won't change your old face, since it
only changes the hair and eye options.
