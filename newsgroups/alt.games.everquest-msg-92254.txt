Well, probably the best newbie guides are at eq.castersrealm.com, under 
the class sections.  I would strongly suggest that you go www.eqatlas.com 
and print out maps of your starting city, and every zone connecting to it.  
Also, tell us your character name and your server, and you will most 
likely have someone from the newsgroup send you a tell and help answer 
specific questions.
