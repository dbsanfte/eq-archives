Keep spreading the word about how much PoTorment sucks!

I won't mention that I did much of 59 and 60 and a bunch of AA there
single-grouping an empty zone....

Non stop pulls are pretty easy to come by there.  Start by single-pulling
the birds.  As the bird gets close, all casters step back to avoid the AoE
silence.  You learn this after one of those...  Head a bit further in and
set up camp at the base of the hill.  Pull the 2 guys up top - or single
pull if you're nervous about doubles - or root one... kill one, kill
other.  Send up puller to get assorted wanders that are left, right and
forward.  Send puller further forward to get bugs for a pull or 2.  About
now the birds have popped behind you.  Single pull them again (and yes,
one type of bird is *very* low exp.  Oh well).  Make sure puller stops a
bit short of the group to avoid that scary AoE silence.
Lather, rinse, repeat.

I <3 empty zones and casual but non-stop pulls.  I'm glad the entire game
hates Torment, but at my level(s) it works quite nicely and since I'm not
in PoV/PoS contesting spawns the kills come fast enough to make up for the
perceived (?) lower level of all the mobs.  But, as I'm decidedly
non-uber, I could be way off base.  /shrug
