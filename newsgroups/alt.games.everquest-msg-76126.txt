I ended up starting a second druid after my first hit 30. I didn't stick
with it, but my original reasoning was that I just had a great time getting
my original druid up that high so why not do it again? ;) Now, I'm back to
my bard. He just hit lvl 40 and I'm wondering if I'll ever get through the
level in my lifetime. :(
