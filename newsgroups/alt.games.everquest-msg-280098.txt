As you well know, a cleric goes good with anything.  Cleric/warrior would
leave you highly dependent on having other people to group with, as they
lack many elements (snare being the thing that leaps to mind first) but at
the same time would be the most powerful pair.

You might consider throwing beastlord into the mix.  I've seen beastlords
duoing with other beastlords at all levels of the game, and they seem to do
pretty decent.

You also don't have monk in there.  Monks have finally come back into a
semblance of balance in EQ and make a worthy "high dps, more heals required"
tanking option.

All that said, if you don't have any plans or goals of getting to the higher
levels and just wanna "goof off", I don't think you're going to go too wrong
with almost any pair.
