Wow, such a harsh black and white world.  It's entirely possibly for all 
ground spawns to be broken in such a way that they randomly spawn under 
the world.  So sometimes they'll be above it and sometimes under it, but 
they're still broken in the same way.

It's much greyer out here than you seem to indicate.  Also, believing 
something, being wrong, but expressing that opinion doesn't mean you're 
lying, it means you're wrong.
