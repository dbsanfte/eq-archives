99% seems ignorant about the costs of spellcomponents. Especially classes
that have none or litle spells that require reagents. As a druid only used
items are batwings and fishscales so yes i tend to forget about spellcosts
every now and then. On the other hand Lying is not good either. Better is it
to bring it up that you only have a certain amount left and that you are
next to broke and ask if you can loot the bodies without split on or get the
dot reimbursed. As long as you do your work good ppl won't mind donating or
lewtting you have extra looting rights.
