I really doubt this, but I just read an old post from Allakhazam's site
concerning Ocean of Tears. It mentioned that if you were on a mob's hate
list and running for your life, if you jumped into one of the little
boats and right clicked on it until you got the "You have the con,
captain" message, (or whatever it says) that you would be cleared off
the hate list.  Could this be true?
