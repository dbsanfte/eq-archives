You know, druids are pestered as often as enchanters (I should know)...and I
can't REMEMBER the last time enchanters were bashed for any reason, though
I've ignored clarity requests just as often as I've ignored SoW requests.

It makes me think that the idiot druid bashers are VERY MUCH AWARE that SoW
isn't that important...they just want to whine for no reason whatsoever.  If
SoW were important they'd treat druids as they treat enchanters.

So buy some damned sow potions, lamers...and if any of you assholes are rude
to my druid, you'd better hope I forget your name when you ask my enchanter
for C2 or SoS. Muhahaha
