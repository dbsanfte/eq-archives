I'm sure connection speed plays a factor in how fast you zone, but it's not
as important as the overall system speed of your PC.

I have two friends that live in an apartment complex with a shared T-1.
Without fail the one on the slow machine takes up to a minute to zone and
the one with the faster rig always zones in less that 45seconds.

On my machine (1.2 Gig T-bird, 256megs ram, UDMA 66 drives, static DSL
connection and everything pretty much tweaked out) according to my logs, I
average a 22 seconds per zoning. I haven't played with any of the datarate
stuff in EQ either... it's default.
