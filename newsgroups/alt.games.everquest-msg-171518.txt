True, online only.

$12.95 a month US Dollars. If you buy 3-month, 6-month or longer
packages you get a small break on the price. This fee includes
unlimited play, and all patches/updates are free. You still have to
pay for any expansions you do not yet own or that come out in the
future.

EQ is run by Sony (ie big corporation). If you cannot trust your
information with them, then you cannot trust anyone. There is always a
risk putting your information out there, but I don't know of anyone
who has had a problem with EQ information being stolen or used.
(unless they trusted someone they should not have and gave out their
login information...a *BIG* no no)

Well 400k+ subscribers and growing may or may not be compelling to
you. Most people who play EQ get hooked. It isn't affectionately
called "Evercrack" for nothing. If your willing to take a
chance...play for the free month and see if EQ is for you. At most you
will be out the cost of the game.

No

Yes

Joys and tribulations. Online gaming can be extremely fun and
frustrating. The anonymity of the Internet brings out the best and the
worst in people. EQ is no exception. You will meet great people and
you will meet jerks if you decide to play. I personally have found
more great people. (say 100-1 great vs jerk or so)

If you don't think EQ is for youand you want a fantasy (ie Dungeons
and Dragons) type game with single player and multiplayer Internet
options you might want to try Never Winter Nights. It has a complete
single player game, as well multiplayer. The MP in NwN is free and
does not require a subscription.
