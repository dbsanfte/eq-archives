Some streakiness is a feature inherant in true randomness.  In
other words, if you are doing a random number between 1 and 10,
you should see two 6s in a row just as often as you see a 6
followed by any other number.  Three sixes in a row just as often
as any other three digit number, and so on.  But there are 9
other possibilities for that second digit, 99 other possibilities
for those two digits; streaks happen, but they aren't Likely.

If you see strings of one type or another more frequently than
mere chance would predict over a very large sample, then the
system is indeed less random than it might be; you shouldn't get
66 more than about 100 times in 10000 rolls, 666 more than about
10 times in that same 10000 rolls.  But at the same time if you
shouldn't see those strings any less than about that often,
either, and since you can do the same strings with any other
digit, you should see ten times as many strings as that; 1000
pairs, 100 triples, 10 quadruples and so forth.
