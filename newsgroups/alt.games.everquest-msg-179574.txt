And this is a bad thing?  My main is a 42 bard and I don't think I
have any class specific abilities that anyone would be willing to pay
me for.  I don't think Warriors have any abilities that someone would
be willing to pay for.  I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but at
least you have something.  I don't mind that my bard doesn't have any
class specific abilities that someone would be willing to pay for
because if I need any plat I can just solo 5 hill giants in Rathe. 
:o)  For the record I can solo them doing the charm/swarm kite.  I do
not tank 5 hill giants.

Also, I really would suggest starting a different class.  I've only
played five different classes but the approach to the game is very
different with each class.  I just started an ogre beastlord and it's
a lot of fun.  Soloing has it's advantages and from what I've heard,
the Beastlord can easlily solo a yellow con even in the early 30's (is
this true?).  I grouped with a beastlord a few weeks ago and they are
great in groups as well.
