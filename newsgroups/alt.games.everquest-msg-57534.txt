Whoah, they improved the female barb head a lot. It was very long
jawed and strong looking (on the first new model shots) She looks
pretty good in these especially in chain.

whoah!

Im hoping that is my new wood elf druid look, cute! ;)

The iksar looks nearly the same to me as the old model.

AHAHA male dark elf looks the same too.. same stupid newb outfit,
why'd they make a new model and evidently have to redo the texture and
do the same dumb ones for human and male dark elf?

Ogre doesn't look quite as "giant dancing baby" as it did in the first
shots I saw.
