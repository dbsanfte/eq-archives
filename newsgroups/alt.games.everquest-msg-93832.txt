I still believe that there have always been, and continue to be, race
and religion faction caps in the game. And I don't think it's a "bug" at
all, but intentional. (Probably in keeping with the roleplaying portion
of "The Vision") Prime example is Trolls in Guk. We're the historical
racial enemies of the Froglocs, so of course, we start out KOS to the
live and dead sides. People in our guild who screwed up their live side
faction have fixed it on the dead side. I got to thinking, "Hrmm.... if
I could fix that faction it would make getting down to LGuk Dead Side a
lot less of a pain in the arse."  So, without touching so much as ONE
live frog, I proceeded to kill the Ghoul Lord (and I'm guessing he's a
pretty GOOD faction hit with the live frogs) no less than FIFTEEN TIMES,
along with all the undead frogs in the hallway. (This was on a couple
consecutive camps to try to get the SMR for one of our rogues.) People
camping with me wound up being well loved by the live frogs, with
tickertape parades in their honor being held in UGuk by the adoring
amphibians. I went to check my faction:

Live_Frog_01 Scowls at you, Ready to Attack.

Chuck you, Farlie. That's when I decided to go gank their King for his
stupid crown to use in my raid kit.

Stooooopid fucking frogs. No wonder my people eat them.
