I did my pocket cleric's epic in 9 days, start to finish, while never
missing a raid.  Nothing required more than a single group of 65s, and most
was soloable.  It is one of the easiest epics, and is easily the most useful
epic.  You would seriously have to be a fool to not want it as a cleric
main.

You probably should play something other than cleric if you don't have the
minimal amount of patience required to get one of, if not the, biggest
impact items a cleric can own, with minimal effort and people throwing
themselves at you to help.  Then again, you might want to re-think that
whole "in a guild" thing as well if you don't have that much patience.  =P

Yes.

Yes, or at least a very very very strong suggestion, depending on the guild.

*refusal* of anything is a firing offense.  But then, that's why some people
think "uber" guilds are made up of asses.  =)  (The irony is, the uber guild
thinks the person that refuses and gets booted is an ass...)
