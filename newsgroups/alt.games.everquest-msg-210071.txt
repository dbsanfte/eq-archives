    If you have the time to leave the chain and cast a heal on someone else,
you have too many effing clerics in your chain and should tighten it up. The
original poster is talking about clerics in the CH chain, not clerics in
general, and he's right. MA must live, everyone else is secondary. On our
most recent Enlightened kill on the weekend, most the raid died except the
last warrior, because the clerics kept him alive at all costs. Had he died,
we would have wiped.
