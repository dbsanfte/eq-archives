Thank you for all the advise from those who resonded.  I totally agree
with you guys about LoIO, I just kind of ignore everyone and there
shouts and have been solo there from 18 to 20 then I did get with a
Sarnak Fort group and got to 22 in 2 days, I am SO bored with LoIO and
really need to go somewhere else.  I am going to SOuth K next, but
since I have not been there yet I don't know what to look for.  

Where shoul I go there and is it easy for me to solo or should I try
to get into a group?

Thanks again for the advise.
