I play on the Rathe and 'for donation' used to be the euphemism meaning 'for
sale' - used to be if I said "will make a generous donation" - I'd get lots
of responses.  Now, it seems, when I say "seeks Taxi to SK vicinity - will
generously donate" I rarely get a response - if I say "...will pay 50pp" the
taxi offers pour in.

I wonder if the term "donation" is becoming archaic in the world of EQ...
