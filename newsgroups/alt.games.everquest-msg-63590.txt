Hehe, i only use my hotmail address in here, and since "kursus" is a danish word, it get caught in just about every dictionary spam match, so i get a LOT of spam anyway, if a bot get my address in here in wont even make an impact on the spam.

You know you get spammed when you have the inbox protector (whee, 
useless spam filter if i ever saw one) turned on, and after a week of 
not logging in get a mail from hotmail that your over your 2 MB mail limit.
