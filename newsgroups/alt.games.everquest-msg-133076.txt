Soft touch, no question. I have a hard time refusing polite requests, 
and that's my undoing (unless they are for plat or items... those I 
don't have a problem at all refusing), but demands? I take a special 
pleasure in mocking those who demand anything from me.

One thing that really bugs me is someone asking "any porters on" over 
guildchat, me ignoring it, and then having An_Imbecile_Guildie_01 going 
"Hanrahan is on"... First, I'm not a "porter", I'm a Druid. I'm only a 
porter if I'm porting, and if I'm not porting, I'm not a porter, and 
hence I don't reply. I profoundly resent people in the guild who assume 
that: Hanrahan(online == available for ports), especially since I'm yet 
to receive, say, an invitation to a super-efficient XP group, as opposed 
to a desperate single melee needing a healer.

Bah. /rant off
