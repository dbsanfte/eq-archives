No.  
You can munge, you can filter, you can use disposables.
There's never a need for a FAKE address, except to make it impossible
for ANYONE to send you mail.

Nor did I say it was, except in the specific case of fake name +fake
address, in which case it is evidence of their being, and choosing to
be, totally anonymous.
It's not evidence of their intent for being totally anonymous and no one
said it was.

Why should I consider your opinion on something to be worth anything, if
you won't even be identified with that opinion?

That is exactly what Ross was saying; for the most part posts from the
totally anonymous are of lower quality than those from people who are
willing to be identified with their posts.

I'm not totally anonymous since I use my real address.

As I said (and you snipped)
Spam is irrelevant - I get about one piece of spam every 4-5 days.
That's not what gets sent to me, that's the one of hundreds or thousands
that slips through the filters.

If you can filter out 99.9% of the spam, it is irrelevant.

>I don't know where you get the idea that it's  not. 

It's not relevant at all concerning using a FAKE address.

You can munge your REAL address and not receive spam.
You can use your REAL address and filter the spam.
You can use a REAL but TEMPORARY free e-mail address (hotmail/yahoo/etc)
and abandon it once the spam density becomes too high.

There's no _NEED_ to use a fake address.
