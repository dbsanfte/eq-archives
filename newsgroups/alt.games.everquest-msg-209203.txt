Ok, Uvan, you earned this.  Lean back and enjoy it.  I don't often indulge
in a diatribe, but I think this one was earned.  This is from memory, not
cut and pasted from logs, but I've done my best to recreate the
conversation.

So I'm waiting for a friend to show up and do some smithing for me when a
friend asks for some help shardfarming for a cleric epic.  I think a moment
about the toons this would be the most fun to do with, and pull out
Soulfrost, my 62 enchanter.  Since Frosty is the one who's supposed to be
meeting the smith, I leave my main, Rhian (64 wizard) parked in Felwithe
with an /afk message "/tell Soulfrost to get my attention, I'm helping with
a cleric epic" so my smith won't talk to me for a half hour and wonder where
all the infused mithril plates are.

I run through OT, /wave at the General as he chews up some newbs, and hit
Skyfire zoneline.  Hook up with my clerical friend, we decide to work over
by BW, run on down there.  She and I buff each other dizzy (as is customary
when two buffing classes hook up), medd up, and go to town.  I kick out an
animation, slow a Chromodrac, get dispelled at (didn't stick), let Zobober
get aggro, wait until he's hit with Boil Blood, and haste him - now SoV is
in the second slot, and the Chromo will just dispell his own DoT all night.
Works like a charm - or better, since it lasts more than 12 minutes.  (Ok,
enchanter humor there.)

I'm working it for a good hour or so, chewing through the chromos with some
help from the occasional chanter or cleric nuke and a heal or two, when I
get a /tell from Uvan.  "Cn u help me plz."  Hm, name doesn't ring a bell.
/who Uvan comes up dry; he, she or it is not in zone.

/r "What can I do for you?"
"I need help plz."  Points for being polite, if not for spelling.
/r "What help do you need?"
"Cn you quad me lvl."  It took me a second to realize this conversation had
started to my wizard; I glanced over to that computer to see he'd sent tells
to Rhian saying, essentially, "Cn you quad me lvl."  However, since my
command of d00d is less than fluent, I opted to confirm.
/r "Are you asking me to quad a level?"
"I need to go on a guild raid bad, I'm only 50, lvl for raid is 51, cn you
come to TD and quad me a lvl.  Only take 15 20 min."
I have a soft spot for folks in this plight, but I'm already rather busy -
at the moment, I'm rather busy helping my animation and the cleric chew up a
spermie.
/r "I'm sorry, kinda busy already.  I'm helping a friend with her epic.
Can't your guild help?"
"I want to go on raid, plz help quad me lvl."
/who all Uvan
Uvan - Level 50 Druid - Wood Elf - Tenebrious Mountains
/r "YOU'RE A DRUID??"
"Plz help quad me lvl."
/r "A level 50 druid is asking a wizard to come quad a level onto him?  Have
you no shame?"
"Plz Plz PLZ"
/r "You're aware the Druid's Grove would crucify you for even asking, and
I'd lose my Wizard Union Card."  I glance at my health bar to see I'm at 60
health and the cleric is getting pissed trying to keep me healed.  I fire
Eldritch Rune and move away from the wurm to let my pet taunt off of me.
Sorry, Madi.
"Plz PLZ help quad me lvl."
/i Uvan

After I stopped laughing and could type well enough to explain to Madi, she
forgave me my distraction - she was giggling herself.  At least Uvan served
a purpose, breaking up the tedium of the camp.  The truly funny part is, if
he'd just gone and quadded by himself for the amount of time he was begging
me, he likely would have gotten the same amount of XP anyway.
