Ahhh, we knew Absor read the Tower, and now we know they can actually
consider the points put forth there.  (post 50 firepet tuning to the
contrary).

Alright folks, calm down. 

First - charm pets are interesting simply because they give us the ability 
to give you better pets in situations of our choosing. Obviously we can't 
improve pets that you can summon any time, any place to be as good as 
situational pets. 

Second - you all have to allow us to test things without breaking out into 
sudden fits of panic. Heck, this one didn't even get into testing before 
you guys broke out in hives. 

Third - I've been told that this one had already been axed for many of the 
same reasons you all have pointed out here. 

/em sighs 

Anyhow, we do appreciate your feedback. That's important to us. But the sky 
isn't falling. Not yet.

Although I can't agree with him - any level of overreaction was worth it to
try and make sure we didn't get another Frenzied burnout or MGB added to
our AA list.
