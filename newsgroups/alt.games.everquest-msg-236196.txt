*shrug* it actually happened to me once.  I can't remember what the exact 
dealy was, it was something like I managed to zone while holding plat at 
the exact moment that I closed my inventory, and on the other side of the 
zone, I had 12 plat in my inventory, and 12 plat on my cursor.  Now, I 
could see how, if I could really be troubled to figure out what exactly 
I'd done, I could make a huge profit off that, so I sat and thought about 
it a while, and eventually bugged it and destroyed the extra plat.  Or 
maybe I managed to zone with a bank window open due to lag?  I can't 
remember what I did, but it was zoning from bazaar to nexus.  And note, 
this was like a year ago, so it has nothing at all to do with current 
bugs. :)

But what I did about it is beside the point!  I took advantage of an 
exploit!  I should be banned or have all my exp from later in the day 
rolled back!  Um.  No thanks.

And do you really think they're going to try and figure out whether I 
deleted the duplicate plat or the real plat (assuming they have some kind 
of duplicate plat detector)?  Do you think they're going to go through and 
say, ok, we roll back everyone except people who /bugged, /feedbacked, 
/telled a GM/guide, or emailed one of the six or so likely sony help 
addresses?  Naw.  Either they screw people who found it by accident and 
tried to deal with it honestly now, or they let the bastards who exploited 
it get away.  Or they bring the servers down now before enough people 
figure it out well enough to exploit it good and proper.
