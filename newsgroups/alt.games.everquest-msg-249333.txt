I've tried *all* of them. And if I had to pick then I'd vote sharvhal & 
shadeweavers thicket as the best newbie zone. Nobody is KOS, unlimited 
newbie mobs under the city. Past level 5 you can go to shadeweavers, 
theres lots to kill (and easy kills), easy to navigate zone, interesting 
quests, merchants selling food & water, and a banker available without 
zoning, and of course the pok book, and a zone in to PC if you want to 
make that step.

Oddly enough its largely empty. I doubt most players, even the vahshir 
have even tried it.
