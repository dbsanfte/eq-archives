Hi

I installed luclin today, although the player models are a bit different,
the textures on the rest of the land (only checked out areas around
freeport) dont seemed to have altered that much at all, i though the game
was giving all new textures, with an all new 3D engine, and to be honest by
game looks almost identical to what i was playing last night (before luclin)
somebody said i should visit luclin first, is there anybody who has some
good screens of luclin (that match the ones of the back of the box?) as
except for the additional land (luclin) im beginning to feel well ripped
off.

Thanx
Toy
