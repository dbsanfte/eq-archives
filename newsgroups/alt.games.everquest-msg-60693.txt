I totally agree.  I can't believe how many people do this even after I tell
them not to.

Absolutely.  He's the tank, not me.  I'm starting to wonder why I even HAVE
a weapon at this point.  Probably because I'm still to chicken to give it up
together.

Lol, it's hard enough to get them to keep pace even without sow sometimes.

Some people will NEVER get this I think.

Yes, and though not as powerful I might ask to pull with a disease spell if
more than 1 are close and both will come anyway.  Good to get this spell off
with no-one around as my "Back up!  AoE disease incoming" macro is only
understood by a select few.  True, not the best choice for grouping but
usually effective.

Shock of Poison....drool...

You really need longer battles to show the true power of a necro.  Often
times I find that small groups of like 2-4 is when people really notice what
you can do.  When there are several peeps beating the baddie we can never be
fully utilized.
