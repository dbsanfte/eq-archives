It never bothered me in EQ1, but in EQ2 it is something of a 
turn-off...their zoning does kind of reach piss-taking levels at times, 
especially in city travelling. I feel they shoot themselves in the foot 
in this respect, though I can understand them wanting to keep lag down, 
I've noticed WoW handles the total lack of zones with no impact on 
latency that I've seen.

Either way, the lack of zoning in WoW is a breath of fresh air, 
especially when placed alongside the exceptionally speedy login.
