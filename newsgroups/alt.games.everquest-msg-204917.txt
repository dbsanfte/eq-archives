Are those mutually exclusive?

You get your meditation mana regen rate while on a horse so long as your 
are not moving, and you are not engaged in melee, even while you are 
casting spells.  You so lose the ability to just duck out of casting a 
spell, you have to dismount and /duck in order to actually interrupt a 
spell in progress, or move enough so that when the casting time is up, 
you will get interrupted.  You also lose the movement speed advantages of 
any buffs or run speed AAs while mounted.
