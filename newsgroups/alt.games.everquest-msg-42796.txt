Ah, this may be true.  Unfortunately we only have two real choices...be
strong, or be a pussy.  Either way others will want to hurt us.  It's my
feeling, proven out by US history, that being strong shuts people up a hell
of a lot quicker than being a pussy.

Khadafi - bomb him and he shuts up.
Hussein - pretend like we're at war with them*, and turn into a pussy at the
end and let him live.  Now for how many years so far has he very publicly
made us a laughing stock?
Embassy bombings - pussed out totally
Cole attack - pussed out totally
Declaration of War against the US - I vote fight...it's obvious that being a
pussy just gets us deeper into trouble.

*I very much appreciate our servicemen & women, and they did a hell of a
job, but the Gulf War was little more than a training mission what with the
way Iraqis were BEGGING to be give up.
