No real PH for Quillmane I believe he is on a random timer I heard he is
suppose to spawn once every 24 hours. But he does have the ability to spawn
just about anytime I have seen him or I should say heard he was up 2 times
in a 4 hour period when I was hunting in SK, but that's been a long time
ago.
