There's the opposite to that too. I play a bard (a good one I hope), and 
people keep telling me how to play and what I can't do. I've played to 
52, there's no need to tell me that I can't do crowd control when I know 
I've controlled 4-5 mobs. 
Or a cleric that once told me to stand next to him and sing mana song 
while tanks beat down a single mob outdoors. OUT-flippin-DOORS! I do 
have snare, I do have fear, pathing here is fine.
Grrr
Sorry, just venting too
