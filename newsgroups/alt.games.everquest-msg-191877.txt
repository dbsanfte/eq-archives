    According to the last parses done at EQClerics, we're within 10% in
terms of damage done to a same-AC warrior. Given that the total change in
damage taken due to Riposte, Dodge, Parry etc. is supposed to be 12%, and we
do have some Dodge skill, I'd say that based on that parse set we DO have
plate mitigation. That was a limited data set, so more data is required, but
it is interesting. I wouldn't have been surprised to find out that, prior to
today, characters with identical AC and defensive skill scores took the same
damage over time from a given mob regardless of armour type. After today,
cloth and leather classes get the shaft.

    I doubt it'll be that bad. I'm guessing this is just a change in how a
mob gets from point A to B when aggro.

    I'll tell you after tonight. This one is a real kick in the teeth for
me, since prior to this I could partner with a charm class and not feel like
I was leeching XP. Now, if I can't heal without getting major aggro, the
charm class will just go solo without me. And given how fast an unaggroed
mob regens HPs in the solo zones that are of issue, at least two of those
solo classes won't even miss me.

    Add up damage done to the killed mob by the group/raid that gets kill
credit. Determine what portion of that damage was done by charmed pets
controlled by the group/raid. Use that percentage of total damage done to
determine what percentage of the XP is removed, up to one third. I'll bet
that's how it works, or is supposed to work. So the standard charm XP 30
minute AA's will become 45 minute AA's.

    I could see three possible changes here. One, a rooted mob will not
attack the closest opponent, but rather will attack the closest PC or
non-charmed pet opponent. Two, someone that is not on the hate list cannot
run past a mob being engaged by a charmed pet without taking a swing or two
(prior, if you hadn't done something to the mob, it would stay on the
charmed pet). Three, if a soloist pulls two mobs, he will not be able to get
the second mob off himself and onto his pet without some serious
manipulation. Before, if you ran the second mob past the charmed pet often
enough eventually it would aggro on the pet. Only the third item hurts a
soloist in any way. The first item actually makes it less likely that
someone could join a soloist for XP, as now there's no safe way for a melee
to join a charm soloist.

    So, really, these changes don't hurt the soloist as much as they do
people trying to group with someone with charm. Charmed mobs take your XP
away, cannot take aggro as well, and will cause the healers in group
inordinate aggro when they try and heal them up from Enrage/riposte damage.
Even if charmed mobs, on the whole, increase the total XP per unit time a
group can get, the perception is now that they steal XP in addition to
making camp unsafe and they won't be wanted. Meanwhile, the charm soloist
isn't really hurt by many of those changes. Only the change not announced in
the patch message, that the resist mods on the post-60 charm spells have
been eliminated, hurts the soloist to any degree. Good going, SOE - instead
of screwing the soloist and making them want to group, you've managed to
accomplish the exact opposite.

    SOE has screwed up every illusion introduced into the game in the past
with faction issues. Since they can't remember when they make a new illusion
to check the faction issues, they've eliminated them altogether. I can see
an exploit, though. We'll try it out tonight, to see if it works. If it
does, there might yet be a good use for charm. Charm a mob, have an
enchanter with Project Illusion cast a playable race illusion race on it,
set it loose. Hopefully this will make the mob be KOS to all other mobs that
players are KOS to, and it can be used to clear other mobs. Sounds a lot
more complicated than just using the mobs as pets, but in cases where
there's tons of mobs in camp at all times and you want them dead fast
(Corinav event), I can see it possibly being handy. I wonder if this could
also make a mob be KOS to PC's that wouldn't otherwise be? Like, charm a
town guard in a good city, turn it into a troll, set it loose.

    Hide overrides Invisibility, but doesn't get rid of the Invis icon. If
you move while Hiding and don't have Sneak up, Hide drops. So this change is
just to tell someone that now they really are visible. There's no simple way
to deal with this one, since people would even complain if Hiding
automatically got rid of all Invis effects (I needed that buff in case of
dispels!).

    Sure sounds like it. Time to max my languages!

    More like "six times less useless". Anyone that actually wants to
progress in PoP still has to kill gods. This just allows people to get into
zones to do XP there. One of the complaints about them was the components
were reasonably rare. So you couldn't get people to do the quests six times
to get everyone in a group keyed up. Now, one time through and everyone is
keyed.

    There was at least one door in High Keep that couldn't be opened by any
method in game. I imagine that door is history.
