That's about as close to a reasonable alternative response as I've seen. 
If you are very busy or think the person is unnecessarily wasting your 
time, set the fee as high as you would need it to be to make you feel 
your time was well spent, regardless of how ridiculous it might sound, 
and politely tell them that under the circumstances you will only do it 
for that much. If they have a problem with that, you have an /ignore 
list. No angst. No worries.

However, in the interest of full disclosure, I've recently begun trying a 
similar approach when it comes to dealing with inconsiderate motorists on 
the road each day (meaning not letting my hackles get raised). I must 
admit that it's not working out quite as well as I'd hoped. :/
