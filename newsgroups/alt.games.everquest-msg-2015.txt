I died from that *once*. The sad thing was that I did that after a year 
of playing EQ -- reinstalled my computer, and forgot that I didn't remap 
my keyboard. Kinda funny to see a 46 bard do that :)

Running with the level 2 AE song under Kelethin, when it starts raining 
merchants painted for war.
Camping a place with my monk (51) and druid (30), forgetting which 
computer I'm facing and jumping into the fray with the druid. No Sow, no 
armor (well, Tizmak)
Dying to a bunch of deep green mobs in Paw (before the upgrade), because 
I was lost and didn't have gate memorized. I couldn't find a spot to sit 
down to mem gate
