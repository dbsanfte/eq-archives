I went to PoH today with my guild and a (sort of) ally guild and we dropped
Innoruuk :)

That was the most extraordinary thing I've EVER experienced, seriously!
Being catapulted across the room by Inny's grav flux was as fun as hell,
especially since it wasn't hurting much at all (100 dmg hehe)

For a "newly improved and buffed Innoruuk" he was kind of weak, I was
expecting way more of him. Maybe thats why we succeeded, we expected him to
me 10 times worse than he was.

Overestimation rules! :)
