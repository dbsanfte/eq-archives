Had my enchanter visit the Warrens last night (for
some reason, my halfling druid of Karana is KOS
with the undead Heretic guards, how strange.)
Rather disappointing, in my opinion (but then,
someone had just trained a pack of kobolds to the
zone boundary as I entered. Being the nearest
available target and already aggroed, guess who
they picked on?) I probably won't be back, just
too aggressive for a soloing enchanter.

My issue, though, is their version of the "ruined
your own land; you won't ruin ours!" While I was
looting my corpse (third time using the safe "fill
slots and zone before placing equipment" method),
I heard, "Scumsuckers like you have ruined your
own lands." being repeated over and over. I was
considering a /petition on language when I
realized that it was the *kobolds* speaking.
Shocking! I did end up filing a petition, saying
that it was rather unfair having mobs use language
that could get a player suspended. About a half
hour latter, a guide in the form of an ogre (and
speaking in ogre RP) said that in the context of
roleplaying relatively mild names like that were
acceptable. I thanked him for the clarification.

This makes me wonder now... would I get in trouble
for calling a gnoll or a wolf a "son of a bitch?"
The "scumsucker" was aimed at an Iksar; perhaps
the kobold was complimenting the scaled warrior on
his alcohol tolerance?
