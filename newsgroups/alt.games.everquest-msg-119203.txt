I've not seen anyone actually give you the citation yet, so here it is.
This is from the Developer's Forum at http://eqlive.station.sony.com,
the official EQ site.

"2) How much experience does a pet take from a group is it still 1% on
average (Various player tests have indicted that a pet takes the same
amount of experience as a player)?

A) A pet will take a fair share of the experience (as if it was an
additional
party member) IF the pet does more damage than all other group members
(individually). If any party member outdamages the pet, the pet only takes
1% of the experience."

That was later amended to clarify that the pet has to outdamage the
*entire* group to earn more than the standard 1% share of XP.  In
other words, assuming 1000 HPs (and no regen), the pet would have
to account for 501 HPs damage before it would take more than the
1% XP it *always* gets when XP is gained.   That's true regardless
of the number of people in the group, including solo situations (a
group of one.)
