One of these days I'm gonna have to work/talk my way into a high-end
guild just so I can see first-hand this odd seeming "life" you folks
are leading up there in the nose-bleed section.  The mobs I've fought
with Kaev on the way to 55, and the gear of the people I've grouped
and (rarely) raided with, just don't give me any way to relate to
some of the comments I read here.  Or maybe I'll just abandon Kaev
and stick with the low-end game, not sure I could ever make the sort
of time commitment that seems to be required at the high-end.

Well, ok I can understand that, but I don't see how it relates to
"break mez properly".
