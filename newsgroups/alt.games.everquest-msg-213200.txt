I've had the same crap on my ADSL connection for so long I've forgotten
what it's like to be trouble free.  Try setting the magic .ini parameter
(?datarate? can't recall, not at home atm) relatively high (9.0), this
will eliminate some of the LDs.  When you are playing keep half-an-eye
on your lag-o-meter, when it shows you starting to LD make some chat
text happen (hail yourself, send someboy a /tell, doesn't matter just do
something pronto) and it will almost always prevent you from being
dropped.  As for the Bazaar, sometimes my trader stays up indefinitely,
other times I get dropped five minutes after I leave the room (can get a
good idea of when connection lost by checking chat log).

I have no IRQ sharing/conflicts on my machine.  Personally I think its
at my ISP, I have noted occasional lag connecting to their name, mail,
and news services with similar (and similarly random) frequency while
doing other things online.  They, of course, blame Qwest, but I see
similar lag with our service at work and we have an ISDN connection
here (same ISP).

Heh, other than the hail/tell during active play I just grin (or rather,
grimace) and bear it.  Every provider involved blames somebody else and
I see no good way to trace the problem (I don't think it's SOE though,
as the problem does not appear to be limited to EQ).
