Yeah, which would be a killing point were I to consider joining a
guild with the rule Archer refers to. Saying you can't even ask for
help from the guild on 1-groupable stuff is quite harsh...

Don't even need a full group. Did all but 2 fights with just me at
level 51, a 65 warrior, and a 63 cleric. One of the two was the first
spirit fight I did and was severe overkill, the other was the (old
version) Grimling War part, which I did solo at 49.
