THe ZEMs are used to market the expansion to existing players not the
general public and they are very effective in getting people to move
into the new zones. Not a major selling point but its the only thing
that will work for a certain percentage of the player base and builds
the excitment of the new expansion. ZEMs aka xp, are a huge incentive
to buy an expansion just like the generous loot tables until they get
"fixed". Remember PoP and Windblades?

One last point,  if they (ZEMs) arent being used to sell then why the
pattern of nerf the old zones twink the new ones? Like I said not a
flame just an observation of a consistant pattern.
