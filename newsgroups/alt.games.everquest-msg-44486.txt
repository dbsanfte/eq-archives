I wish it was that way on E. Marr.  I've got a werewolf talon sitting
in the bank ready for the crafted BP quest...but sitting in EC I see
crafted BP's going for _less_ than the cost of the 3 gems that the
centaur wants in addition to the talon.  WTF would I want to do the
quest (rogue...everybody in my guild on the raid with a warrior and
even warrior twink got a talon...I was an extra "hold this" bank
slot :-)  ) and actually  LOSE money on the deal?

I'm resigned to just keeping it in case somebody else wants to twink
a warrior...
