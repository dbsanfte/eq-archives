So long as the universe had a beginning, we could suppose it had a
creator. But if the universe is completely self-contained, having no 
boundary or edge, it would neither be created nor destroyed it would 
simply be. What place, then, for a creator?
-Stephen Hawking, English scientist

Question with boldness even the existance of a god; because, if there be 
one, he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of 
blindfolded fear.
-Thomas Jefferson, U.S. President, author, scientist, architect, 
educator, and diplomat

If you want to get together in any exclusive situation and have people 
love you, fine- but to hang all this desperate sociology on the idea of 
The Cloud-Guy who has The Big Book, who knows if you've been bad or 
good- and CARES about any of it- to hang it all on that, folks, is the 
chimpanzee part of the brain working.
-Frank Zappa, American musician

If there is a God, he is a malign thug.
