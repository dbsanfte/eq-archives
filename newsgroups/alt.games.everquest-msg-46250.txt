I remember what happened when I overclocked my Voodoo 1 card with Quake.
The only thing it did was cause these weird "sparklies" to appear on the

I wouldn't recommend overclocking a video card. It's not likely to be a
significant increase anyway, and you'd risk burning out the card.

New GeForce 2 64meg cards are only $99 now. Maybe you should upgrade
instead.
