My own experience on EMarr:

LGuk - filled with high-level people solo-camping.  Hours spent shouting 
for group with no luck.
DSP - filled with low-level people with an anon guildie standing behind 
them throwing in help when they need it.  Hours spent shouting for group 
with little luck.
Someone also mentioned whichever Solusek has the dogs in it.  Forget 
which one that is :/  The entryway nearest the druid rings in Lavastorm, 
at any rate.  Got a partner there the first day and we got creamed after 
one dog, then I had to go, the second day I got a group, we went in and 
started laying waste to all around us, and ... about 10 kills in 
everybody had to go.  D'oh.  Too bad.  Not sure what the exp was like, 
but the loot?  Wow.

I'm going to try Iceclad and Crystal Caverns and maybe Eastern Wastes 
next time I get some time to group.  But lately I've not been all that 
much against Verant 'encouraging' grouping ;p
