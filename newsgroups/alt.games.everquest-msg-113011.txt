They shouldn't.   Nothing makes bards regen mana faster
(or it least according to verant nothing is supposed to).

I don't know how much they'd sell for ( a LOT), but there is no
way you'd get a gnome mask for 'em.  Gnome masks ended
up with a bard or rogue anyways, and what does a bard/rogue
want with some FT III shoes?
:-)

The mask is worth MUCH, MUCH more...sorta like how  nuts a
amulet of necropotence is.
