    With regards to this specific asshat, you should have suggested he
actually PULL mobs back to the ML, as opposed to zerg ever onwards. A few
long runs back to the group with three mobs nuking him all the way might
have taught Chimpy the value of at least checking to see if everyone is
there.

    With LDoN I've been doing a lot more grouping for XP with people I
wouldn't otherwise group with. And it's amazed me how bad some people are at
dungeon basics. Imagine the embarassment of being in a group with three
Time-flagged players and three Elemental-flagged players, and nearly wiping
on "normal" difficulty because neither the wizard nor the necromancer were
snaring. Un-be-freaking-lievable. And this was after they'd both been warned
twice, too.

    I've had other people go zerging forwards to pull, no matter what was
going on. We're doing a "kill the boss" mission, and the necromancer
(different people) tries to split the boss out of a room of four guards and
the boss. Doesn't get a Feign off, dies, goes LD. We have a ton of time to
wait for her, but as I say "Let's wait", the wizard says "I might have a
trick to pull it!" Well, he dies from the boss and two adds he pulls, and
since he was standing right beside us, they chain onto us. So it ends up
that the SK and the rogue kill the boss while the shaman contributes slows
and some DPS, and I offtank both the adds while healing the MT. We won
because we had gear that stupidly outclassed the dungeon, not because we did
things the way they should have been done. Sigh!
