Hello Rodger...many thanks for the tip..went to bazaar found the "Ribbon" 
price was 3600..was also told to look for "Wild Lord's Gauntlets" found 
these for 350!..needless to say they were purchased...works well ..,while 
I,m on the horse..dog seems to lag so far behind..at least now he can catch 
up and watch me die!!!lol....speaking off.......was playing "tourist" 
yesterday..heading to zones that we new to me...was in North Karana by the 
bridge to  the South version...well low and behold there was a
"dragon"..specifically called a "plains dragon"?...did my little "con" and 
he was "indifferent"
walked over had quite a look..very neat graphics..wife comes in with 
coffee..I get confused(no there was no Tia Maria in hit!)...hit "melee" 
button instead of opening my spell book!!!!well well well....straight left 
for 1500..then a right cross for over 2000!! and I,m on my way to the 
"funeral home"....well after my first encounter with death(which started 
this game fantasy) I learned to buy extra "get out of limbo" tokens from the 
"guild hall ghoulies"....next time I,ll learn to leave them in the 
bank!!!!lol...Peter
