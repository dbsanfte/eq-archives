I've picked up several "Chipped <random gems>" in Crystal Caverns;
based on the item info, they *should* be doing some fairly nifty stuff
(one adds 1 AC and a bonus to save vs. cold; a couple more claim to
add 2 to Dexterity and another 2 to Agility). They aren't lore, and
claim to be all/all. No equipment slot is listed, and, indeed, they
don't drop in any equipment slot. The problem is, they don't seem to
have any effect - I've tried putting one in a main inventory slot, in
each of a variety of bag types, and (unsuccessfully) in every
equipment slot, all to no avail.

Are these things broken, nerfed, non-stackable, or otherwise
"unusable", or am I just doing something wrong?
