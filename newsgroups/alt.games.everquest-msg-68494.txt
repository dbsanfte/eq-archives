Could a lvl 35 Druid conceivably solo GrimFeather? I've killed him once,
but I admit that I let the tower guards do most of the work. What I'm
afraid of is Ensnare not sticking the first time, and GF eating me alive
before I have time to cast again. In fact, I had trouble outrunnnig him
even when he was Ensnared, and me SoWed...

On the other hand, I get a bit bored in NK sometimes, and grow reckless,
and the idea of trying him has been lurking in the back of my mind. :)
