Not saying the idiot farmer didn't deserve it. (That's not exactly
"playing the game" in my book.) I'm just saying I wouldn't flaunt it
publicly if it just "happened to occur".  Not sure about what any
"official" ruling would be on that, (rights of a pet vs. player, et.
al.) but if a GM or guide saw it, I could certainly see
servers/circumstances and/or specific guides where it would get your ass
reamed.
