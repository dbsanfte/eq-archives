/rant ON

400 people and every goober and his twink have their pets and familiars out
and flapping...

J-boot spam... that guy should be banned for 'zone disruption'

/shout and /auction spam... duh, guys... that's what the /bazaar command is
for

75% of Vendors are too lazy to find an open patch to set up in, so they're
all on the corner nearest the bank/s... well, if I can't find you in the
crowd, I'm not going to be ABLE to buy from you... SPREAD OUT A LITTLE!!

/bazaar list limited to the last 100 items... so if you've been there a
while, your stuff no longer shows up if the search isn't specific enough

/rant OFF

Actually, it's pretty good if you can deal with the hassles... there's some
nice prices around if you hunt, while people who've had junk for too long
price it to move fast.

I've managed to spend about 6k so far... nearly cleaned out all my spare
cash! :o)
