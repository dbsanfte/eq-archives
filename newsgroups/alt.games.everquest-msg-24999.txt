For each of us, the game is what we make of it. If you're able to
manage the voluntary suspension of disbelief enough to role-play at
all, surely you can muster it to the level needed to ignore those who
don't roleplay.

You've identified the problem with GM events - the players. The events
that I've seen have been well structured and planned, and often are
designed to move the world along. The problem is the idiots you
mention, who show up for no other reason than disrupting the event.

Perhaps you're playing a different game than I am? Yes, much of EQ is
static, but there is always change happening as well - several large
changes have been directly tied to GM events. There are story lines
going on in EQ, if you but watch for them.
