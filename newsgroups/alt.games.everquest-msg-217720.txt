You exclude yourself from your own groups?

You should grow up a bit, yes.  If all followed your path you would
have only chain classes grouping in one dungeon, plate in another,
etc.  At first I suspected you might be just a common troll, but it
now appears that your social inadequacies run far deeper than the
ordinary sort of "hey lookit me i'm an ignorant teenager and i'm
cool" stuff.  Pretty sad really, but I suppose I can pretend there's
hope.  Seek help, please, it will make the world a better place.
