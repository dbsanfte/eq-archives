Just wondering anyone really cares if someone inspects you?  I hate it when
people ask to inspect me, I would rather they just look it saves me the time
of having to type "sure".  Has anyone ever told someone NO you may not
inspect me?  I'm proud of the equipment I'm wearing, whether I'm in summoned
leather or full SS armor.  If it was/is that big a deal turn off your
inspect notice in the .ini file that way you don't see the msg anyway.  I've
had mine turned off for over a year now and not one person has inspected
me(that I know of).  If you don't know your being inspected it wont bother
you.

As a side note, I do ask people if I can inspect them because I know it does
bother some people, I just cant understand why.  Are people ashamed of the
armor they have.  I just wonder who started the whole asking thing?  Its not
like they are checkn out your dingle berries or your whooohaa.

What does the rest of the collective think?
