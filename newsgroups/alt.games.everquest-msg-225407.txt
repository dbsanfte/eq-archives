You'll never see me give up HP/Mana for +Cha, but considering I'm at
276 int unbuffed, max at 280 (I have so many other things to spend
AA on before IE or PP,) and that I have +6 int aug in the bank, I can
easily give up in for CHA.  I'm also planning on rolling on +Cha augs
if any drop.  In fact I need to do something about those dumb GEBs
I'm wearing, replace them with little to no int, but +HP.

I still had < 150 int when I was 50, <200 int at 60 - The only time it
ever got noticed is when some stupid mage twink asked what my int was
in OT.  Yeah he had 200+ int, but why did he keep getting aggro then
running in circles making the melee's job hard?  
 
As for raids, There are very few fights I'm in these days that I can
actually get rid of my entire mana bar and a rod shot.  Either the mob
dies first, or I'll get aggro and summoned.  This is why I'm not worried
about pushing my int cap up - and why I can lose up to 32 int and still
max with VoQ on.  I will gladly trade int for +HP, important saves or 
FT.
