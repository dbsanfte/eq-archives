Here's a concept...maybe you can understand it, maybe not:

I want the OPTION to keep MY belongings secret because <insert drum roll
here>:

WHAT I'M WEARING IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

I think the concept of "none of your business" is pretty danged simple but
apparently it's over your head and Verant's.  Want to know what I'm wearing?
Why?  If I like your answer maybe I'll allow you to inspect me.

It has nothing to do with game mechanics or graphics.  Thousands of things
DO look identical to other things.  So what?  Why is it YOUR business what
*I* am wearing?  Don't you have enough to worry about with your OWN gear?

And yet another disclaimer before some moron states this very obvious thing:
Yes, you can turn off inspection messages.  Yes, I'm glad that Verant put it
in there, and yes, I'm using it.  That has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with my
complaint.
