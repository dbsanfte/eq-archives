Okay, stop right there. I fear we're going to start hearing about your
high paying job, your beautiful wife, and how you are both amazing
ballroom dancers. Just save it, as it's been done before. 

Regardless of how you feel about yourself, or your friends, your gross
generalizations could not have had any purpose but to incite anger and
disdain in others. Also, you can go ahead and drop the God complex
("simply put, I am the high ground"). If the "high ground" is being a
self-centered, self-righteous, egomaniacal snob that has to perform an
"intervention" because his buddies have decided that they no longer want
to be around him, then I'll hang out underground with the Dwarves,
thankyouverymuch.
