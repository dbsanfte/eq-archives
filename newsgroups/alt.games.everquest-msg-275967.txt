I thought 2 separate zones were a bad idea to begin with.  I think the
separate barter/bazaar zone would go down as the shortest lived zones
having lasted only one month.

Another great idera, no more running through pile of sacrificed toons
in Nexus.

Not sure if that will help.  I still get an occasional prevented from
finding message if I use find trader but when I right click I can get
an idea where to find the trader.

Not surprising as many of the items are used in quests and usually are
worthless afterward.  Glad I was able to unload them to npc before the
patch as it probably won't be sellable anymore.  Now to see how many
traders wonder why theirs won't show up in bazaar anymore.

I bet the people over at www.eqtraders.com will be very happy to hear
about this </sarcasm off>

The way it should be the first time. =P  Now if SoE would fix the
frequent serrver down issue that kept me from sending or recieving any
emails.

THANK YOU!!!! A guildie was running electric bill just to keep his
toon logged 24/7 in the guild lobby so people don't end up 5 zones
away and lost.

Including the auto switch check box I hope.  I got tirerd of trying to
change and forgetting the auto is off by default and I end up trying
to fight mobs with a pair of opal encrusted stiens. =P

I needed that too, some maps were too light and practically invisible
against textured background.

Less lag too =D

That'd be an interesting one to watch for.  Now if SoE can explain
raining in dessert...

I smell a possible exploit, a cheap way to get out of unwinable duel.
