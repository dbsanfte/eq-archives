    There are two Portals in OoT and I think a couple in Timorous Deep. They
go to, surprise surprise, the two docks in OoT and the Evil/Good docks in
Timorous. I think that it'll turn out to be faster to port to a dock and run
to your target island than to wait for the boat, then wait for it to pass
your target island. The only hitch I see happening is with KOS folks -
you'll presumably have to un-invis to talk to the port NPC, which means
you'll be visible when you hit those docks.
