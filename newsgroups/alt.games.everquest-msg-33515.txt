Hi ..

I just want to vent my frustration at groups who pull Gnoll Elites and other
highish level Gnolls to the entrance (Qeynos side) of Black Burrow. I was
trying to get through BB from EverFrost and managed to get to the zone
change area when I was met by loads of angry Gnoll Elites who attacked me
instantly, I'm not a lowbie at level 16 but my Wizard found it impossible to
get through to Qeynos Hills due to the shear volume of traffic there. Also,
having healers and buffers *right* next to the zone change area isn't fair
to others that simply want to get out of BB. If you must pull to that area,
have some consideration for others and leave room to get through!!!

Otherwise it might be worthwhile for the patchers to take a look at Black
Burrow.

Thank you ...

Stevie.
