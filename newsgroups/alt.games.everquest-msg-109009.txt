    First, I am not affiliated with the Christian Right, and would generally
call myself liberal.

    The point I want to raise today is that it has become obvious to me that
the economy of Everquest in many ways matches incentives with some of the
most savage and deprived neighborhoods and countries throughout the world.
After 18 months and 4 characters on Tholuxe Paells and Fironia Vie, I have
realized that I succeed only when I commit murder.

    Now, before you all reach for your Flamers, let me explain. I love
heroic fable, legend, and fiction with a passion. I believe in the
phenomenon that JRR Tolkien named Mythopoeica; that we have in our cultures
and in our selves a memory or longing for the heroic tale, something that
all of us recognized and respond too when we see it, or hear it, or watch it
unfold. But that is not Everquest.

    In Everquest, I are not warriors for right, or "the people", or perfect
state, or the great king. I am not much more than a welled armed thug. How
do I advance? By killing. Who do I kill? Grendal? Hitler? The soldiers of
George III? Jack the Ripper? Not really....

    As much as I and my guilds have tried to do otherwise, our best bet is
to form a small well-armed gang of reavers and find the homes of some
mentally disabled creatures of unusual shape and color, and wait until one
of them walks outside to stand foolishly in the firelight. Then the fun
begins.

    The best tactic for looting and pillaging these desperate creatures is
to torment one of them to run away from the safety of their home, then to
gang up at about 6 on 1 and slaughter the poor bastard. This way, I can
advance.

    Suppose I want money? Well, how about walking through an enter cave
complex of dog people, butchering the helpless, and gathering in their loot.
Then I can sell the booty at fair prices, and takes nothing of my skill or
daring to acquire.

    I could try to learn an honest job. I could go straight. Learn tailoring
or brewing or baking or the making of metal crafts and jeweled treasures.
But what is the point? The time it takes to work hard and industriously to
learn the skill is thrice the time it takes to learn to kill. The materials
are horribly expensive, or already in the possession of someone else. Then
when I add value, the legal merchants give me nothing, mark up my goods by
1000%, and wait for some plutocrat to wander in and by my work on a whim.

    I can make weapons and armor, if I can kill enough to afford the skills
and materials. These I can sell, because in a world full of thugs, only the
tools of thugs have value.

    Will I stop playing? Probably not, only because I cannot get past the
simple wonder of the depth of the virtual world of Norrath. But if only, our
victims were really bad, if orcs actually raided Freeport, if the goblins
attacked Rivervale and I had to rush across Kithicor with dozens of real
heroes to stop the Pickclaws from taking over the Thicket. If the Deathfist
orcs had intelligence and tactics beyond losing their tempers.

    If I could sell a pot for a decent price. If I could buy ore cheaply in
the mountains and sell it for a premium in the Karanas. If bear pelts sold
for good prices in the desert, because their are no bears there......If
animals ran when struck with arrows, making hunting with a good bow and
arrows, and good skills a real accomplishment..

    If only I were king of Verant.....
