True, most of the time.  Sometimes, I do though, and, even then, I still 
don't have gate memmed, largely because I run faster than the mobs anyway.  
Even with a summonning mob, I almost always make it to the zone, just takes 
longer.  Of course, at level 65, it's a lot easier to be cavalier about it, 
as, I keep enough buffer for at least one unrezzed death, usually two.
