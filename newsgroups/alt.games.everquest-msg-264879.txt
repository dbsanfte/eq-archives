I know quite a few EQ1 players who had a main and a couple "serious" alts,
on the same server, usually in the same guild.  So it is pretty easy to get
to 3.

All it takes from there is finding that you have two RL friends who are
playing, that you'd like to make an alt to play with, and they are on two
different servers, both different from your server.

Many people will never hit 4, but a lot of people will easily run into that
limit.
