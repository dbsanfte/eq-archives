 Maybe. Like I said not really sure on the starting values anymore. I
just see STR as a waste since it's an easy stat to raise through
equipment and buffs. I think I'm hitting 221 STR unbuffed. Add a Shaman
or Druid and it maxxes fairly easily.

 About the same here. I think my STA is 201. No Primal yet though.
Golems are being stingy.

 I don't think starting points make or break a character. However, they
can make growing up slightly easier. If he would have said he had a 40+
monk I would have said just keep what you have. However, a level 4
doesn't really lose much by starting over.
