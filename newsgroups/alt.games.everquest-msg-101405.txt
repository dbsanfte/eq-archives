Since English happens to be my first language, allow me to help
you with that -- you could pare it down to:

   "The people I've heard from generally say that the Ro
   Armour is not worth the hassle".

This way, you make it clear that you are basing your statement
on a limited sample size, instead of leaving the impression that
you can speak for the "general opinion", well, in general.

If I don't take that sort of bullshit personal attack from 
the emotionally-disturbed Bizbee lying down, I'm sure as hell not going 
to take it from you.

I've posted here for nearly two years, son, and I've been one of
the most prolific posters of helpful, informative, fact-filled
posts here.  For example, feel free to tell me who was I "trolling"
when I posted stuff like this:
  http://makeashorterlink.com/?V3FA5179
  http://makeashorterlink.com/?P20B1279
  http://makeashorterlink.com/?N28B1279
  http://makeashorterlink.com/?K26B3679
  http://makeashorterlink.com/?Z3CA2179
(And I wrote the material at the link in the last one, son.)

I strongly suggest that you either document your boneheaded 
accusation, *NOW*, or retract it and offer an apology
ASAP.

Do I sometimes disagree with people, or take issue with
something they've said?  Sure.  But who doesn't?  That hardly
makes me a "troll", nor someone who "only" posts from a
"contrarian position" to the "most reasonable" comments".

But when faced with personal attacks, like the manure
you post above, I'm going to defend myself.  I've spent too
much of my own time helping people out in this newsgroup
to let a childish outburst like yours go unchallenged.

And you've been posting here, what...  Oh right, since
last month.

If you're unable to take a gentle retort like the one I
posted in response to your original post here without
getting your tender feelings so bent out of shape that
you can't refrain from going off on a multi-post rant full
of personal attacks, then I submit that perhaps you're
too touchy to engage in Usenet in the first place.

So sit down, pull up a chair, and start browsing those
Usenet archives, wading through the 3,160 posts I've
made to this newsgroup, so that you can try to support
your puerile accusation that I "only" post here from a
"contrarian" position here to "troll".  This ought to be
*highly* amusing.
