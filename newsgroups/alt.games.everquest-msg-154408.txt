How do you figure?  The last thing I'm gonna do when I tank is
to show the mob my back, if the mob's actually dangerous that's
about a 50-50 chance of a stun every five seconds or so.  This
advantage would allow them to disengage/flee (which is part of
the job when pulling) more effectively.

Um, and my suggestion fails to do this how?

I'm not sure how you're understanding my suggestion.  The effect
would be that a mob attacking the Monk from behind would be no
more effective than a mob attacking the Monk from the front (while
the disc was active), which would go a long ways towards mitigating
Martin's complaint about being slaughtered as you try to lead the
mob into your raid's ambush.  When you are attacked from behind you
do not get your "active" defenses (dodge/parry/riposte/block) and
you can be backstabbed and you are <far> more likely to be stunned
(even by a blow that would not ordinarily have <any> chance to stun
you).  But if you try to lead a mob while facing it you are much
slower.  This would let a Monk lead something to ambush, it is
certainly not at all out of line with the abilities of the movie
characters that the Monk class is so obviously based on, and it
DOES NOT ADD TO THE MONK'S TANKING ABILITY.  Sorry for the caps,
but I am utterly boggled by your assertion that it "restores their
tanking ability".
