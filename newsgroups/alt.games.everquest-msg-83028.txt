Yep, I believe you get 8 character slots, you just need a person to transfer
the items, unless you want to put them on the ground and risk losing to
someone picking it up or decay

> - how many accounts can you have ?

As many as you pay for. There is a CD key, it can be used for 1 account.
Every time you want a new account, you need a key, plus there is a charge of
10$ per month, or 25 for 3 months

> - is pvp possible ?

Yeah, there are 3 or 4 PVP servers, different types of rules

> - is it full of dupes and hacks already ?

Nope, there were a few dupe bugs but they were barely even known and they
fixxed it right away

> - is it possible to solo ?

for your lower levels, yes, but depending on your class, you will have to
start to group, which isnt always too hard to find. Necromancers, druids,
and magicians can solo the longest, but if you decide to play, do a little
research and figure out what class best suits you

> - are there persons in the game who can kick/ban you / censor what you say
etc.

Yep, guides and GM's. they dont really even patrol, at least not unless they
got too much free time. but, if a player reports you for something, they can
get on your case quickly

> ?
> - do you have a stash /how big is the inv (compared to diablo 2 exp) ?

Your bank account is the same size as your inventory (8 slots). In those 8
slots you can put in bags or items. Bags come from up to 2-10 slots inside
them, and can hold different sized items. You can also store your money in
there so you dont get weighed down.

Hope this helps
