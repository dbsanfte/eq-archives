Wizard+Paladin
- fear kiting undead: wiz snares, pal fears and melees
- taking down casters: wiz stuns and nukes, pal stuns and tanks

Wizard+Rogue
- aggro kiting: wiz snares and spams SoTF, rogue shreds from behind

For the kiting examples, the wizard is only out the cost of a snare or
two, so mana outlay is minimal. Rogue backstabbing is very effective and
has little downtime. Undead fears are low cost, as is paladin melee. And,
of course, almost no healing is required at all.

Wizards solo pretty poorly against most casters, because of their low hit
points and mediocre anti-caster abilities. Paladin here provides tank
mezzing, excellent anti-caster abilities, melee damage, and whatever healing
is needed.

Couldn't help you much with locations. I haven't kited enough with my
wizard yet, and (for the aforementioned reasons) avoid soloing him in the
caster-heavy dungeons. Lower Guk, perhaps, with Wiz+Pal combo seems like
an obvious win though. Giants in Rathe Mts for the Wiz+Rog combo...?
