Have you visited Kerra Isle yet?  How about the island in Erud's Crossing?
You can take the Nexus portal and travel to GFay.  Then head over to
Steamfont and head out to the gears by the mino caves (check eqatlas for
maps) and there are 3-4 static undead that you can single pull that will get
you up a couple levels pretty quick.  Plus, with Steamfont, you can pop into
AkAnon for training and spells.  When you get to 16 with your new spells,
try East Karana.  The gorge hounds will do you well for about 5 levels.
