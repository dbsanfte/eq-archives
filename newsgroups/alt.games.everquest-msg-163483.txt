Yes, it is true, it is just a Request for Comments.  However, it is the
generally accepted guideline for netiquette.  I hope that helps.

All other things aside, it is common courtesy to use the accepted norms in a
newsgroup.  Some newsgroups encourage topposting.  Some encourage binaries.
Some encourage HTML (I would think anyway, never actually looked for one.)
In this particular newsgroup, bottom posting and/or interleaved posting is
the generally accepted norm.  There are certainly dissenters, as there will
be anywhere.  You may choose to do as you will, and people will judge your
based on your actions.
