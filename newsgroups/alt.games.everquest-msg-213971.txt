I just started a bard last week and I love it! Just hit lvl 21 and I'm
now beginning to understand about bards and carpal tunnel ;).
Something I do to save from switching pages so often is map an
inventory slot with a large container in it. That way you can right
click the container and you basically have an extra 8 or 10 slot
window for swapping weapons and instruments and can save your hotkeys
for other uses. Still need the primary and secondary windows keyed of
course, but this then leaves you with 7 slots for other things. If you
were trying to keep from changing pages at all you could get an extra
slot by simply leaving the bag open on the side of the screen out of
the way. You would then have 8 slots you could key elsewhere, just
make sure you don't accidentally close the bag if you went this route
:).
