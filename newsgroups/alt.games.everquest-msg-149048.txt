Well I'm not ready to give up just yet.  :-)

I think I understand this whole link spoofing thing quite well, so I'm
somewhat confused by your confusion!

Please allow me to put things into my own words, and maybe you can show
me what I'm missing:

You seem to be saying:

"My friend saw some really unusual items being advertised un /auc.
How can an Everquest player make up items like this and put them
in things like /auc's?"

Others are saying:

"The players are not making up those items.  The items already exist
in the official, one and only, Everquest item database.  It has already
been shown how to create hot keys to do /auc's for these items."

Can you tell me what I am missing?
