Well... Given that Hanrahan seems to have hit a wall on what he can 
achieve solo, I'm toying with the idea of starting a Paladin, as I've 
never played a melee class. I would like to recycle my Bard's name, 
Parsifal, but I don't know exactly what the situation is after the 
changes with the name server. Will the name be immediately available to 
me after deleting the Bard, or will I have to wait?

Also, I don't have a whole lot of money for twinking... What would be 
the one single item, for around 1k, that would make the biggest 
difference to a young Human Paladin? Also, given the race restriction (I 
only play Humans, basically), what would be the deity you'd recommend, 
in terms of good equipment available?
