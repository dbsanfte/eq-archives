Root dot doesn't work so well for a bard :-)   My ranger wife can root, but our
current DoTs are so weak that it would take too long to kill the mob that way, and have
a high chance of breaking the root before the mob is dead.   Once I get chant of
Frost and Chant of Flame, things may change, because I could twist those two plus
curtailing chant (also a DoT of sorts).  I could see snare plus those three DoTs working
very nicely....  just lead the mob on a merry-go-round of death :P
