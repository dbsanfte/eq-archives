Would it be any different if say this happened :

A girl was out walking around.. It starts to rain, and a nice bloke pulls
over, and ask the girl if she would like a ride cos of the rain.. The girl
accept that, and gets in the car. They drive over to her place, he comes in
for a coffe, and they have sex. Then the guy decides to give the girl 200$..
And the girl takes the money.
Is that selling sex? Could she be convicted as a hooker for this? Mind.. she
did not ASK for the money..or did any claims for needing money for sex..

Like if i say : hi i am giving away my acount.. And the one gets it GIVES me
money in return.. If i am not ASKING money for it, but i get money even
though.. (Like if you /shout In desperate need of a sow please!  .. And a
guy replies /tell dumbass Ok.. come here and i will give you a sow .. You
needed the sow, and thus you give the guy 10pp for it.. could you then
/petition Hey.. i got a sow from someone, and i gave him 10pp for it.. that
is not legal.. )

Get my drift? :)
