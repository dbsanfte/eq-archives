Here's what I think goes into it:

(1) It's a big zone with a lot of camps. The zone can run with very
few people stepping on each others' toes with as many as 100 people.
The more people you have in the zone, the more likely you are to have
a few bad apples who begin the disruption. As with any social
endeavor, there are far more people who will contribute to disruption
than actually start it in EQ.But, once one starts it, they come out of
the woodwork.

(2) The level range is awkward. It's actually reasonable to start an
XP group of Iksar in LOIO as low as level 4 or 5 to hunt Sarnak
Hatchlings, low level goblins, and skeletons near Cabilis and
theoretically possible to level from 1 to 50 without ever adventuring
OUTSIDE of Lake of Ill Omen. But, the bulk of the XP to be gotten
there is from 18 to 28, which is the transition period between
"everybody bashes and some of us cast" and "everybody in the group has
a specific job." It's where you first have to start setting out ideas
like "one puller per group and that puller shouldn't be the enchanter
(even if it does help you get pet aggro.)" In a lot of ways, it's very
much a training ground for how to group until you have to start
worrying about raids.

(3) Proximity to Cabilis. I would also call this Faydark syndrome. A
lot of the less mature players gravitate towards playing Iksar. For
whatever reason, Cabilis is packed with beggars and malcontents.

(4) Multigroup Camps and Interlocking Fields of Fire. There are very
few camp spots in Cabilis that can't support more than one group,
particularly if a group pulls slowly. OTOH, a well-organized,
well-equipped group could pull all of the goblin caves, the back of
the sarnak fort, or the entire courtyard of the sarnak fort. What
happens when you get a more efficient group hemmed in by too many
people pulling from the same pull of spawns is that the camps tend to
drift and differences of opinion tend to arise over which spawns
belong to whom.

At least, that's my perspective after leveling 4 characters into their
upper 20s there.
