Great! I bet there will be alot of wizards standing in the Nexus spamming
out:

Noobie says out of character: Buffing See Invisible & Infravision for

Because this spell buff will obviously be in demand, because its so uber and
needed. I bet there will also be dozens of characters shouting out "Looking
for See Invis & Infravision buffs!"
