Seems like all the decent dungeons on Bristlebane are bring-your-own party.
I went to dalnir.  Was impressed with the experience, had fun, made a level.
Came back next day, no one in there. Came back later on, no one in there.
Never anybody in there when I do /who all 29 30 just to be curious.  Oh
well, guess I gotta work on my friends to come with me to places like that.
