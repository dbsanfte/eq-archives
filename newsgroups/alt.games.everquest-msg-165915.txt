If I were to use a naughty program like EQW, which of course I don't,
I'd guess it might look like this in the file which is probably
called 
eqw.ini

[Positions]
640by480X=240
640by480Y=92
800by600X=125
800by600Y=13
1024by768X=-115
1024by768Y=-96
1280by1024X=-243
1280by1024Y=-224
1600by1200X=-403
1600by1200Y=-312

That would be the X Y corner pixels, like  125 out
13 out from the upper left corner, I'd guess. Notice that they can be
negative.
