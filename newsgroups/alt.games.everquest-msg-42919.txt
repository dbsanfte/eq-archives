I have had a Voodoo card in my machine.  In fact, I'm running on a
Voodoo card again, and it's quite happy.  I also tried using the
Diamond drivers for the V770, but it was as unhappy as before.  I
would love to remove all the Voodoo drivers, but haven't seen any way
to do so easily.  Would Voodoo drivers for a totally different card
affect the performance of a V770, they shouldn't but video cards have
become a black art in and of themselves.
