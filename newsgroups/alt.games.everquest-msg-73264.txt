  It's my understanding that very few sites out there actually have
trouble "paying their bills" with the money they make through
advertisements.  Yet most of them have some sort of optional pay
service, ask you to click their banners, or ask for donations, ect.
The reason is that in most cases, it takes a lot of time and energy to
run these sites.  It's almost a job (for the bigger sites, the amount
of time/effort necessary to keep it running is probably at least equal
to a part time job).  Most people wouldn't do it if they were doing
"just because they love it."

  Go to eqatlas.com and read the whole spiel the guy who runs it made
about running his site.  "Donations" in the case of EQ web sites
should be presumed to mean "optional payment" rather than "life
support for the site" because in most cases, somebody somewhere
probably is making a profit (however minor it may be).
