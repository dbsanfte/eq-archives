Unable to field a team to do Scarbrow back in my 30s, I shelved this 
project.  Last night I got the bug to look into it again, grabbed my 53 
chanter buddy and decided to give it a go.

Guildmate caught wind of what we were up to and brought along a 56 SK.

Didn't feel like looking up the details, so we guessed that perhaps the 
lookout was looking at the spawn site for Scarbrow; set up enchanter 
over to one side, SK back about where we guessed the spawn would be, and 
I handed in note and ran over to chanter.

SK had instructions to snare Scarbrow, pull them all away a bit, then 
FD, so the oracles would head for camp and we could single Scarbrow.

Looking around, saw orcs coming in from the north, opposite the lookout 
direction.

Band of three of the charged, the other three hung back, Scarbrow 
included.  I tell group to circle around and help me on Scarbrow and his 
two buddies, I snare Scarbrow just as the second trio rushes forward.

Contrary to orders, SK and Chanter run into camp and aggro the other 5 
mobs.  Well, I pull Scarbrow back away from camp and kill him, then run 
in and start helping out.  Chanter has run off by now, SK is playing 
with about half the orcs and the others are following chanter around.

We take down the two that stayed, and then have chanter train us with 
the rest, which we peel off and kill one at a time.

I'm sure there were easier ways, but heck, any landing you can walk away 
from.

Go back and loot Scarbrow, hand in his drop plus my old ring and get 
ring 5.  Still lame.

Grage, 55 Berserk, Luclin
