heheh, maybe, but i also remember first time i explored dragnors cauldron,
5th level dwarf pali (my first char in beta), totally lost, found this new
zone, lost everything i owned that day, had no idea how to find the zone
again even if i woulda had guts to go back

then again, i didn't trash the char either, bummed a rusty sword and went
back to killing
