Fungus Grove crashed while we were in mid-fight.  It came back fast, but
we'd all been restored to old saves--I lost about 90 minute's worth of
hunting.  :/  (My corpse had an hour left for rez on it when we crashed, it
had 2 hours 48 minutes when we came back, though we were all where we'd been
before.)

Bah, I say, bay!
