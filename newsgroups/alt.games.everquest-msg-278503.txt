I have read many posts regarding that some of Valinayles quests are 
broken. The bug seems to be in hailing him and not getting a proper 
response.

At about the same time, I have have not seen Lord Gydak, or his PH's to 
be up. I have camped him repeatedly, and PH's were on about a 15 min +/- 
timer. Now the PH's just don't seem to be up anymore. I have sat there 
while sneaking, and have seen many other players run into room, up to 
chair, back to spawn point, wait around and leave. (irevelant, but fun 
to watch while breaking boredom)

Anyone have any info on Gydak?
