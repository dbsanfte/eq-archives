    IIRC you haven't wasted any xp in hell levels. The progression that they
use to figure xp per level doesn't scale smoothly, hence you got a pileup of
XP in the 'hell levels'. By removing them, all Verant will be doing is
smoothly out those xp humps. You will still need the same xp to go from 1 -
60.
