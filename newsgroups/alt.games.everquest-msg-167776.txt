When that kind of thing happens to me, I logout for awhile and do
something else. Then I come back later, get my corpse and go about my
merry way.

You don't venture into enemy territory where that can happen without
backup. You buff yourself and mem PvP spells before zoning. If you
still die despite your best efforts, you try to help your mates secure
your corpse. If all that fails and you suck, you logout and get your
corpse later. Or play an alt for awhile. I guess there is also the
option of begging for mercy from the enemy, but I've never stooped to
that myself.

I've played on Rallos, and Tallon. Rallos is too hard core with item
looting for my taste. Tallon became cross-teaming hell. Sullon is just
right.

That's not true either. Plenty of people train on other servers, PvP
or blue. It's almost impossible to catch a crafty trainer.

I do hear what you are saying. I can understand that why you don't
like the idea of people being able to "legally" train you. In practice
on the server, I don't find it to be such a big deal however. You just
learn to deal with it. Rooting the guy trying to train is always an
option. Turn the train on the trainer. Make a train of your own, if
that's your style. Find a different zone to hunt in where the enemy
teams are not training. Get some friends and bind camp the trainer to
teach them not to mess with you. There are plenty of options.

Good did have it hardest at the start for sure. But there are plenty
of tough high level good players now. Good team attracted people
looking for extreme challenge, and so they ended up with some top
notch players, imo. That's changing lately though. I've noticed some
of the lower level goods to be putzes. Maybe that's because good is
more established now, so there is not the challenge factor to scare
off the losers.

I see that you haven't been on the server much since it opened. Try
rolling up a newbie evil DE now, and then come back here and tell us
how easy it was for you. FYI- nektulos, and nerriak itself are
favorite PK grounds for all kinds of high level neuts and goods. I saw
one 50ish good warrior on a horse sit on the nektulos newbie log for
entire days harvesting the less than 10th level DE crowd.

Rightly so too. If anything, neutral should be nerfed. Take a look the
PvP stats, neutral is way on top, and has been since the server
started pretty much.
