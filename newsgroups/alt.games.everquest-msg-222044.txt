I went into the Bazaar the other day and bought the Club of the Ice Ocean
for my HIE Paladin but when I tried to equip it got a message saying it
couldn't be used by members of my Diety. Yet when I checked the weapon there
was nothing mentioned on it about Diety. So I tried it on my other
characters and they get the same message. I was wondering if there is
somewhere I can go to get a list of what items can't be used by what
Dieties, as I don't want to waste a couple of hundred plat on another item I
can't use.
