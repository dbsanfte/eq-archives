I will give that a go thank you very much.  I just checked the leather
padding and it is selling for between 25 and 50pp each, not too bad
really considering that it takes fairly low skill to make it. 

In answer to your question I am a level 65 halfling rogue. My PP is
maxed but I feel it is unfair to the others in the group if I PP the
cash from the monsters. To be honets I havent even tried to PP any
mobs in LDoN hehe. 

Just looking for some new ways to make some cash for myself . 
Thank you very much for the feedback everyone!
