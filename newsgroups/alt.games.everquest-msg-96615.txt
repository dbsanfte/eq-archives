I have been thinking about the coming changes (as reported on the test
server and in this group), and I have seen an interesting pattern.

Most of the changes proposed will make the lower levels less painfull
and annoying. On the surface this looks like a bad thing, but look at
it from a different perspective......

Over the past 3 years EQ development has concentrated mostly on the
mid-end game. Kunark, Velious, and now SoL(to a lessor extent) have
added mostly high-level content. Most class balancing has been done at
the 50-60 level. The only low level content that has improved is the
Iksar and Vah Shir low-mid level zones. EQ is long over-due for some
"re-balancing" and re-evaluation at the lower levels. 

I am willing to bet that at least 30% of all new characters created
are alts and get PL'd to some degree whether through twinking or the
aid of higher level characters. Making the lower levels less tedious
and less annoying through earlier access to Res spells, or respawing
with all of your gear intact is an incentive to play through those
levels instead of PL'ing past them. 

Why are so many of us acting like grumpy old men/women who want the
younger generation of players to suffer like we had to?
