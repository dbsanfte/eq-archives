Im generally happy to have someone leave a camps room for a safe heal spot
so long as that keep everyone actively informed...say in a dungeon thats
useful (by safe spot I do not mean the other side of a zone line), or to
zone an overpull and return immediately. ie I consider that actively
working. I dont like people who call camp on widely scattered groups of
mobs (Upper Guk seems populated by people on this line 'Camp Check'
'Scryer, knight, spiders and crocs' is not an unknown conversation).
