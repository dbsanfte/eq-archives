This looks nice for me, and I used it a few times, thanks.  What are
the other alternate views?  There seem to be 4 or 5 that get cycled
through.  Some have cameras that chase you, others that have immobile
cameras, etc.

Yes, but it feels weird and jerky to me.  I tried a pure mouse look
view (where left/right acts like side steps), but it was too difficult
to control.  If there was a way to turn off just the up/down mouse
sensitivity it might work.  I'm tempted to map keys to look up and
down now so that I can just use the keyboard (ie, without moving my
hands off of WASD, and using the number pad interferes with typing
and is uncomfortable without moving the keyboard to the left).

But I'm getting further now.  I may even earn a coin before I run out
of food.

Some other questions:
- What's "aggro"?  The only definition I've gotten is "aggression"
  which doesn't mean anything in context.

- What's a LORE item?

- The guildmasters often have words in brackets when I hail them, but
  when I use those words they won't respond.  Some do respond, but
  many don't.  Ie, the paladin guildmaster in Kaladim has [training]
  but he won't talk about it.

- What is the base/1/2/3 in the maps?  Are there some maps that are
  layered?
