   I normally don't do the quote within a quote within... 
thing, so I many apologies if I've gotten any headers
attributes messed up.
   Anyhow...I understood the original poster just
fine.  The point was that since Biz inspires so 
many people to flame him, the problem lays with 
Biz, not the dumbasses who respond to him.  Or
something like that.
   Not that I agree with that.  Just cause he's
a lightning rod for stupidity doesn't mean he
creates it himself.  Or something like that.
