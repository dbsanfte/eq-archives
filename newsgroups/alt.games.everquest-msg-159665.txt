Funnily enough, the langseax has seemingly gone up in price.
They used to be 20pp, this is what I paid for my first some 3 years ago and
always stayed there...last one I saw (and this was the1hd variety) in the
bazaar.

If you have 10pp to your name then get yourself to the bazaar and look for
some 1hs weapons, the likes of Beserkers Axe and longsword or Walrus Tooth
are all pocket change prices now. As well as that, bronze armour often sells
for next to nothing now.
