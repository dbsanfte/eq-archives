one thing i found is you can buy alot of foraged stuff for cheap (and 
some not so cheap) just make yourself a wood elf or some class that can 
forage, also you have PoP? I found on the PoT there is a merchant that 
sells fishing grubs, i know that doesn't sound interesting however... 
fishing grubs+ flask of water= brewing to about 120 with about 10pp in 
it.... also there is one merchant i'm told on kerra isle that also sells 
them but never been there myself...


just choose a tradeskill out of your own enjoyment and go with it.. and 
never expect to make back the money that you use...
