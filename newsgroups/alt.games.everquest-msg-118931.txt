I log on with my Druid (level 52).  Check my friends list and see that
someone is on, a Necro (level 51).  He is very excited.  He has been
spending most of his time in Everfrost camping Ice Giants.  Now he has all 3
spawns to himself - been doing that for about an hour.  He is having trouble
keeping up with the spawns, so I am on my way over to cash in... er help
out.

Right when I get there, a shammy shouts out that he is claming the back IG.
Funny since my friend is pulling the back IG and I dont' see anyone else
there.  Shamans, never the brighest people in the world.  Kill giant, loot
and set up for the next round.  Said shaman arrives to see the giant die and
somehow thinks that we just stole his spawn.... and begins to plot his
revenge.

Next giant pops.  Friend sends in pet, darkness and fears and I blast away
with my DD.  Sit and med up.  Shaman is there and starts casting on our
giant...
/em confused
Is he trying to KS us.  I guess its possible, but don't think that he has a
chance.  The 2 of us should be able to outdamage him easily.  Throw 2 more
DDs just to make sure we don't lose the kill... now very LOM.  Hey, why is
that giant not running away anymore..... hmmm, where did the pet go.....
why is the giant chasing the necro around.... and moving very fast.  Better
ensnare it.  Phew!! that was close.  Snare wore off??? That is funny.
 Root - wore off.  Doh! OOM now.  Necro runs for zone with a giant in tow.
Giant coming back soon, so I better med up.

Here he comes.  Snare root and med for DOTs, should be easy - he is almost
dead.  Snare, good!  Shammy cast and snare wore off.  WTF!!  Repeat, run
away and repeat.  That SOB is canceling my magic.  OOM + 1 mad unsnared IG =
run for zone.

Med back up and go back out.  Pleansant words exchanged with butthead.  We
are reduced to 2 giants and shammy takes one in back as I wait for an answer
to petition.  Don't expect anything to happen about spawns, but the
deliberate act of trying to get us killed is just as bad as training someone
intentionally.  Bannable IIRC.  Sit and wait.  Get my answer, GM didn't see
anything so nothing will happen, even my log files no good =(.  Nice GM, but
no action taken.  Shaman logs off.  Another interesting day.
/em vent off

Moral of the story... If you see Yenenx, a barbarian shaman, level 54 on
PREXUS.  Guild is LOST PROPHETS, give him a kick in the ass for me.
