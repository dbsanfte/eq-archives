i found out that a friend plays the game if i could go to the server where
my friend is i would love to but not naked, i have most of my cleric quest
armor and there is no way im going through that again, if i have to pay 50
dollars let me keep my freakin stuff ( 50 bucks is more than the game
itself ). very bad call on verants part i must say.
