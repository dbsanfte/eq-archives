  It DOES do something to prove a KSing issue.  /report is essentially a
server-side log checking function from the way I've had it described to
me... it's authenticated so if you /report something that appears in your
text box, the GMs can confirm that it DID happen.  If the person admits they
KSed, or maybe if you can verify that you got aggro first using a report,
then it will serve as proof if the GM is competent enough to check the
report logs.

  Of course, if action is taken against a person on the basis of a /report,
you probably will never hear anything of it since a GM isn't going to send
you a tell saying "Hey, by the way, that guy who KSed you a while back, we
suspended him for a couple weeks."
