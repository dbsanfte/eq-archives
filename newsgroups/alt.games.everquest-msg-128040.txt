I am not sure what your current class/level is, but here is a list of
quests I enjoyed doing.

Warrior Crafted Armor Quests. 
The gems are pricey (figure on spending close to 1Kpp to make all of
the pieces), but the quest is a lot of fun. It will take you to many
different old world zones. 

Bard Lambent Armor Quests
More expensive and a little harder, but fun as well.

ShadowKnight Dark Forge Armor Quests.
You have to be a masochist to do this one prior to the changes in CT.
It took me two solid weeks of killing with a tracker parter to
complete a set. I don't know if it is any easier now, but looking back
it was a blast for me :-)

Gem Inlaid Gauntlets.
You will find your self travelling a lot, but this is a very fun
quest.
