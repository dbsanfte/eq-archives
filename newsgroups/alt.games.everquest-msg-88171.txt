No it does not.  The only thing that affects success rate is skill level vs
trivial level of the combine.  That is it, nothing else.  If there is a
secondary stat for a tradeskill, which Verant has made conflicting
statements about, then it affects the chance of a skill increase.  The
higher of Int or Wis is used as the primary stat in determining if a skill
increase occurs, then, if there is a secondary stat, it increases the chance
of a skill increase.  For smithing, Verant has confirmed that STR is a
secondary stat, but in at least one quote, it does nothing unless it is
above 185.  It has been stated that Dex affects tailoring and fletching, but
more recently, that has been recanted.  In the end, anything is possible,
Verant is leaving it pretty vague.  This information comes from various fan
faires from statements made by the guy at Verant in charge of tradeskills
development.
