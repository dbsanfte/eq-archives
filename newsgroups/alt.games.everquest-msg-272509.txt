My main is a ranger, and I'm sometimes the puller, sometimes not. It all depends
on the situation. If the group is looking for specific enemies, or we're in a
large area with room to maneuver, then quite often I'll do the pulling - easier
to find the right enemy, and I get a chance to do some damage to it while
running back to the group.
 If we're just sitting near large groups of enemies killing anything and
everthing, or we're in enclosed areas like dungeons, then the main tank will
usually be puller, because there's no need to look around for the enemy, and
there isn't enough time to use many ranged combat arts before it gets close - I
may as well just go into stealth mode, let the mob get aggro on the tank, and
then whack it from behind.
