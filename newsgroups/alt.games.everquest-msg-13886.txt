The reasonable argument to dispute this is that it is a basic game function
that every player is entitled to use.  If you have a problem with this,
blame it on VI not the player.  If a player pays his share just like you and
that feature is available to him, tell me why his/her use of it should have
any impact on you at all?  Are you that selfish?  If you don't like to
inspect others uninvited, don't do it but don't take it out on the people
who enjoy that feature and like to make use of it!  If you don't like to
smoke cigarettes, then don't do it but get mad at others for smoking.  Why
is it rude to use something coded into game?  I understand your concern, but
then we must ask where do you draw the line.  Next you will be complaining
of people using the shout channel, then you will complain of people using
/afk, then you will complain of people using /say in an area that you are
sitting in, etc.  I don't see how anyone can arguethat using a FEATURE of a
game they PAY to play can be rude.  I am sure Verant would have gotten rid
of it if it was rude or it had no use.  I am sure if you are a veteran of
text-muds, you will learn that this feature has been available to players
since the beginning!  In text-muds, you look at people to see their
equipment and it tells them they are being looked at.  Someone looking at
you might be annoying, but they are a paying customer ENTITLED to do it.
Pro-lifers annoy me, but they are entitled to their own opinion and belief
and I don't make a list of people that I will no longer associate with
because they demonstrate in the street and go against my own beliefs and
hound me.
