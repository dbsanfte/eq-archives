Come on, you must know the point she is making.

I was in Oasis a few days ago, killing crocodiles.
I bit off more than I could chew, but not so the
crocodile, who left me with one bubble of health
and almost no mana.

Halfway through the fight I had a necro chasing me
around, hitting "Sow and a heal, plz", repeatedly.

I was also getting tells from some warrior at the
docks, asking me where I was. He was getting
pissed off because I wasn't answering him.

I SoW everyone and anyone, if I can, no matter how
they request it, (pls, plz or please, its all the
same to me), but this was distinctly annoying.

Can you not see how some druids would get a little
shitty with it?
