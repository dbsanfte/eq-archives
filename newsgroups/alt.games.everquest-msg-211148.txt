What exactly is odd about wanting to windsurf, shop, play hockey, play 
everquest, etc etc etc with people with whom you a) have common 
interests and b) aren't irrationally threatened by you, and c) don't 
irritate you by hurling childing insults at you...

Sure if you spent all your time in character, I guess it wouldn't 
matter, but most guilds spend most of their time out of character, 
discussing everything from baseball to work to the news... and the 
ignorant bigotry of the players behind the toons is regularly on display 
for all to see.
