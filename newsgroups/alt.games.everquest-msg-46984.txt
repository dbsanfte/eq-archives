Has anyone established the connection, if any, between skill ups
and int and/or wisdom in tradeskills such as smithing and tailoring?

If so, I'm wondering if it's really worth continuing to pursue tailoring and 
smithing for my bard.  Right now her tailoring is at about 38 (I think), and 
smithing at about 80.  Tailoring materials are very time consuming to obtain 
and vanish so quickly in my sewing kit.  Skill upping in smithing is costing me 
about 8-10pp per point; and doing that in Freeport is a pain because of all the 
zoning needed to buy the molds, ore, and water.  She's lvl 15 and is my main,
so she doesn't have much money.

Her intelligence and wis are fairly low, around the 80's.  Am I beating my
head against a tree?  Should I develop an enchanter or something instead that
has a higher int/wis to do tradeskills?  How much difference would it make to go
from about 80 int to 120 int in skill up rate?

Thanks
