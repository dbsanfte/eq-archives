Go is hard for computers using the Deep Blue approach for several
reasons:

1. The tree is very wide.  There are typically a couple hundred legal
moves per ply, compared to 20 or so for Chess.

2. The tree is very deep.  A typical Chess game lasts 30 or 40 moves
(60 to 80 ply).  A Go game lasts a couple hundred ply.

3. Tactics can involve large areas of the board.  For example, there
may be a stone on one side of the board that I need to save, but
can't, because trying leads to an unfavorable ladder.  Any future
development in the path of the ladder could change the ladder to be
favorable to me.  So, a move in one corner of the board could change
the life/death state of a group of stones on the other corner, by
changing the result of a 60 ply ladder.  This is way too deep for a
brute force program to handle.  A program to handle this would have to
recognize patterns and have special cases for them.

The only area where computers might do well currently in Go is the
very late endgame.  Elwyn Berlekamp has worked out the theory of the
late endgame and that may be able to be programmed into a computer.
However, getting a computer to the late endgame is the current
problem.
