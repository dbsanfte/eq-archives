I believe that in the novel, "Ender's Game" by Orson Scott Card, the army
which is required to destroy the overwhelming alien menace are remote
control robotic spaceships controlled by people in teams with individualized
tasks who have been trained for years in their jobs.

Warrior
Paladin
Shadowknight

Ranger
Beastlord
(holy fuck i'm tired who are the other light damage deaing melee)
Rogue

Cleric
Druid
Shaman

Wizard
Magician
Necromancer

Bard
Enchanter

I don't have a freaking clue how you are going to design and build an army
of robotic soldiers carrying munitions which can be controlled by PC's, but
you had better get on the ball. I believe the "rewards" card system is
designed to measure rebellious tendencies in the population.

I don't think I need to remind you not to pay your taxes this year as you
are no longer under the soverignty of the United States of America, or the
world government which has been formed and I'm sure they are doing some sort
of horrific acts in trying to resurrect their leader somewhere in Europe.
You may be under the sovereignty of the state of California however.....I
would not want to face California in a war let alone the United States or
the combined forces of the entire North American Zone.

How do I know he's dead, because he tried to kill me using a Satanic ritual
designed to make me have a heart attack and because I had invoked the power
of one of the two prophets mentioned in Revelations 11 that made me
impervious to attack and made everything I predict come true.

Incidentally, I previously predicted before a few people while in a mental
hospital that the end of the "world" would occur in 2004. So that must mean
that I am a prophet of God, as a true prophet of God is 100% accurate.

World War III is about to start and my mom is telling me to go to college to
take a class in Introductory Social Psychology, I am about to have her
committed involuntarily far away from here for dementia. I believe I just
did something that you would normally need a doctorate for, cultural change
based on introduction of a new technology, namely the female breast.
