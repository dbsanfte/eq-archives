I didn't think of that... when I solo I have my cleric logged in also to
prevent downtime.  The problem with Velk tho, even a bard <g> can deal with
a spider pounding on him.. and he doesn't need to keep re-charming it, he
already has enough agro to run it back to his group.  He also has the
ability to position it, so with the rogue able to BS theres no way I can
outdmg the whole group

Well I told him "Your breaking verant rules.. this is outright killstealing
and actionable"  and his reply was something like "nope im just pulling in a
different method - from a distance with songs - its you stealing my mobs"
(such utter bs, you know full well if a spider is pulled, you only need to
go to the zone once to see the exact spawn spot of every mob in there)

Well I've seen the castle train in the past, and having done tents a few
times I've pulled them too for exp, but I don't see where they are agrod to
make them stealroll through tents, and run into the main zone area (if
somebody had gone past tents, agrod them and died then they would just
return to where they started)

I didn't wanna wipe tents out, which is why I didn't agro castle stuff (I'd
have just ran through tents, opened the door with the shitload of sentients
in it and ran with it chasing me into the main zone area.. run speed 3 would
stop me getting pwnt before I made it, least the intention)

Well thats where his "what you gonna do now?"  "what you think u can do"
comments were coming from.. by level 60 you know well enough if you piss a
monk off bad enough, he can pull the biggest train you've ever seen

Velk imo is still easily doable, disc, mend, sow and a DA potion.. the
trouble is, I don't wanna wipe out an entire zone just to get him back.
Sure theres innocent victims in a war, but not a whole damn zone :)   For a
60 monk I have a really good rep as far as trains are concerned
