I'm still really undecided on that question... Every time I think of 
something that seems to be a clear example of 'true evil', a closer 
analysis shows it to either be something else entirely, or to be a 
function of difference in perspective on the issue.

}I certainly believe that the behavior of individuals and institutions

}self-interest) and thus found to lie somewhere in the vast grey area
}between them.

Eh, it simply can't be that simple, because altruism and self-interest are 
only opposites if you're short-sighted.  Altruism, in the long term, tends 
to lead to massive rewards.  Sometimes, even in the short term.  So isn't 
being altruistic actually in your self interest?

The closest thing, in my mind, to true evil, is ignorance.
