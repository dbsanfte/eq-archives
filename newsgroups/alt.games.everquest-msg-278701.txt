You are so backwards in this perspective that I really can't imagine
changing your way of thinking.

For warriors at elemental level, there is *one* sword.  For warriors at Time
level, there is *one* sword.  Yeah, they can be a lesser warrior and settle
for an alternative *lesser* sword, but then, the spells I had cast on me at
65 are still just as effective at level 70.

Define "anywhere close".  Virtue still gives me a lot of hp.  Vallon's
Quickening still puts me at the haste cap.  Focus still maxes my stats. 
Wizards still crit for nearly 10k with the old nukes.  Hell, I get kei on my
pocket cleric because it lasts longer and I don't *need* Clairvoyance.

Your argument is straight.  Your perception is highly skewed.  =)
