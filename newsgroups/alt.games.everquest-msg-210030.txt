Upcoming for August 6th, 2003 
It's been a little hectic around here lately, with all the Live, Legends 
and expansion work going on. We're busy in that good way, where you get a 
lot done every day but tomorrow there's just as much to do. 


New adventure unearthed in Lavastorm! In the depths of the Lavastorm 
mountains there is only one ruler. But even his burning breath and power 
have their limits. Rumor has it that there is wealth and danger in 
locations even further below the boiling lands than Lord Nagafen can reach. 
These tales have been spreading like ripples on a calm lake, and their 
point of origin appears to be an upstart barbarian named Morden. Some say 
that he's already delved these fabled caverns and taken what there was of 
value. Other say that he couldn't have carried it all off by himself. But 
most say that he's a rogue, a teller of tales, and not to be trusted. Will 
you discover the truth and brave the heat, or will you sit beside your cozy 
campfire and listen to stories? 


We will be adding platinum to the Shared Bank. In order to allow folks to 
transfer money between characters on the same account in the same way that 
they can now transfer items, we will be adding a spot in the Shared Bank 
for placing platinum. 


New filters and chat message options will be added. We have separated pet 
melee messages into their own category. You will be able to send them to 
whichever chat window you want, or filter them out completely in the 
Options window. We have also added the ability to send /random messages to 
any chat window you'd like. There is no option to filter these messages, 
however, to prevent any loss of the information in cases where it is needed 
(meaning, you can't claim that you didn't see the /random that you lost 
just to force a re-roll). 


New fletching recipes will be added. We're adding a few new fletching 
recipes. The resultant items will only be usable by Rangers that worship 
Karana, and will be comparable to their Tunare counterparts. 


Guktan Illusion will be implemented. Yup, the long-awaited new illusions 
will be available. While the old Illusion: Froglok spell is just as popular 
as ever, folks have been asking for an illusion based on the new Froglok 
models. After our next update, both will be available. 


Adding summoned Burning Affliction items to the Magician's arsenal. Four 
new summoned items with the new Burning Affliction focus ability will be 
introduced. This rounds out the Magician's ability to create summoned focus 
items. 


/memspellset command will be added. This new command will allow you to 
memorize the spell set you indicate (using the corresponding number) from 
the command line or from a hot button. 


Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user interfaces 
for EverQuest, these are the interface files that we expect to change next 
week.
