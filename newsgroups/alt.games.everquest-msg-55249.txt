>West Commonlands until someone kills the Overlord mob. Refreshes every 3
>hours or so.

I went to this one and had nothing but trouble.  Absoultly everything in the
zone was camped and the zone crashed multiple times. (and on multiple servers
from what I hear)  Not sure about the overlord bit because I didn't stay in
there long enough to find out. (but i assume that's correct)

>Northern Desert of Ro every 3 hours as well. Ends when someone kills the ..
>Preacher?

Went to this one as well.  didn't have any crashing problems but once again,
everything in the zone was camped.  There was a lag that made it so you
couldn't see if an enemy was being attacked until you were almost on top of it
(a real pain for us melee classes)  It doesn't end when you kill the preacher,
that's just the beginning of the end.  You kill the snake and that's the end
(everything re-sets basically)

I don't mind GM events but they need to limit them. (limit as in level)  The
north ro event was for the lower levels and from what I saw all the higher
level characters owned the zone during the event, totally ruining it for us
lower people.  People tried to keep them (the higher levels) from killing the
priest but (of course) they didn't listen...not to mention the entire zone was
camped.
Man i hope that didn't sound like i was whining because I wasn't...ah well.
