Supposedly 3 more IIRC, push it to 13 and go all over the milieu's
mysticism. Path of Daggers was ended horrendously seemingly splitting
one book into two - which I got told by assorted acquaintances was a
publishers decision - whether it was or not the problem is the books have
got a bit out of sync - Winters Heart was a thunderous roll through to its
climax, but the next got a bit limp again making me think the plan for 13
books is a) true and b) stretching the story to require significant
padding.

Still, even unfinished thats a heck of a lot of medding....
