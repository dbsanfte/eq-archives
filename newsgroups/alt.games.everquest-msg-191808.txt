You could try the Plaguebone Thiefs in the port in valley of DL, they are
fairly tough and a bit of an under con, but your group should be able to
handle them. seem to give better exp than the same level live mobs. My 51
warrior can solo them but needs buffs to do it and heals, so i normally 2
box them with my 55 cleric along, probably best if the druid snares,
enchanter fears and then cast and beat it up from behind. Only problem is
there is normaly someone camping them on my server most of the time.

Type: Plaguebone Thief
Race, Class: Skeleton, WAR
Level Range: 36 - 40
Is aggressive. <can be single pulled with spells, but will agro if you get
too close when pulling>
Is undead.
