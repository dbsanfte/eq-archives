 That's what I'm wondering. All I was thinking as I read was "It's
about time they did something like this!". I don't know how many times
I've been in a group getting decent xp, a new guy joins (hybrid usually)
and *poof* there went any xp I was getting. I mean it would just stop.
I would have to leave and find a new group. That sucked.
