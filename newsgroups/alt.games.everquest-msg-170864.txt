Scryer's Tresspass, level 52
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3697&source=Test

50 mana per tick for 10 ticks (1 min)=500 mana
recast 2 min 30 second + 5 seconds casting time... almost 26 ticks

500/26~~ 19.23 mana per tick, if you  are fighting casters and can get your
taps off instantly.
Compare to Wandering Mind
6 mana per tick for 20 ticks (2 min)= 120 mana
recast 2 min 30 second + 5 seconds casting time... almost 26 ticks

120/26~~ 4.61mana per tick, if you  are fighting casters and can get your
taps off instantly.
And Theft of Thought (note theft of thought returns increasingly lower
amounts of mana for higher level mobs, even if they are blue... it is
estimated ToT by a 65 enchanter vs a 60 mob generates about 40 mana)
Instant mana tap, 400 mana. Recast 2 min + 2 second casting time, 21 ticks
more or less
400/21~~ 19.05 mana per tick
Mana regen:
Breeze                      2/tick
Clarity                        7/tick
Clarity 2                  11/tick
Gift of Insight            1/tick
Kei                          14/tick
Tranquility               16/tick
Voice of Quellious 18/tick
And the big gun of mana regen
Gather Mana: 5000 max mana (do people have more than 5k mana?)
instant, recast 144 min
3.47 mana per tick
hastened gathering 3 gather mana
5000 mana, 101 min, ~ 5 mana per tick
Other classes
Cleric: Blessed Armor of the Risen             6/tick
Druid Protection of the Glades/Cabbage   6/tick
Beastlord Spiritual light/radiance/purity/dominion 3/5/7/9 per tick
Necro Mind Wrack: 300 mana over 4 ticks, costs necro 600, recast 60 sec +6
second cast 27.27 mana per tick, but costs the necro mana.
Necros have various 'twiches' as well.
Bards... well.. they are bards. I think Lance went over the list of what
they can do quite well earlier.
I left out all the other casters self mana buffs... but aside from the mana
taps enchanters don't get them anyway

this ended up a lot longer than I thought it would be.
