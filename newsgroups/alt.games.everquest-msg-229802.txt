Ubisoft distributes their own European version of Everquest. This version has
its own patcher, and hasn't got testeverquest.exe, so you can't play on test
with it.

Ubisoft also runs three European servers, Venril Sathir, an English lagnuage
server, Kael Drakkal, the German server, and Sebilis, french. Both Ubisoft and
Sony customers can play on this server, however if you bought the European
version of the game or movelogged to one of the new Ubisoft server (after those
of us who started new characters on those servers were assured there would be
no movelogging to them, *grumble*) you are a Ubisoft customer, and your monthly
fee goes to Ubisoft, not Sony. But if you installed the US version of the game,
you'll still have the US launcher with access to Test and the ability to buy
expansions online (I assume, I'm a Sony customer playing on a Ubi server so I'm
not quite sure about this).
