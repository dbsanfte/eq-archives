Are you sure about that?  It's listed in hardcover, softcover, and 
library binding at amazon.com right now.  I think you may be confused 
because the book is the the 'Good Parts' Version of the S. Morgenstern 
classic.  Basically, it's written as if it's a slightly condensed version 
of a classic tale, with all the boring bits about whom is related to 
whom, and what draperies hung in which room, and which distant relative 
gave those draperies, and why they're important snipped out.  
If you've read much classic lit you will be familiar with this, the parts 
of the book that you just skim over because they are so boring.

an original script
