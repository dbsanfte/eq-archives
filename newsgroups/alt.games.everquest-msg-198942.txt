I'm guess he returns the cash if anyone donates more than the norm?
Somehow I doubt it. If you're gonna advertise 'for donations' deal
with the fact that there are idiots in EQ who'll take advantage of
you. Otherwise, set a price and deal with the fact that people like me
probably would have paid you more than what you were asking for. 

I don't pay for KEI but back in the days of druid ports, I'd pay the
10-20p if the porter had a set price or 50-100p if he was asking for
donations.
