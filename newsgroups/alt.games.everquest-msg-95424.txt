Missed this in my first reply...  Most (?all) wisp spawns in WC are
multiple, as many as four at once.  If you see a stationary wisp higher
off the ground than normal you can bet that there is more than one
wisp there.  Once they move off their spawn point they will split up,
be sure they've gotten far enough apart from one another to not chain
agro before you pull one.
