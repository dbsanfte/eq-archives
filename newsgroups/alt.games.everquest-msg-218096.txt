Honestly, I really felt that TheVision(tm) really really sucked.  Boats
sucked, spell book sucked, getting funneled into specific corners of the
rat maze for xp/gear sucked, looking for a bind sucked, massive nerfage
sucked, "Alchemy is Working" sucked, being able to walk a naked L1 from ZI
to King in LGuk during prime-time without even seeing a mob sucked.  Same
thing for SoLB, dealing with "camps" sucked, dealing with ebay farmers sucked,
dealing with lists sucked, dealing with /shout /ooc /auc spam in xp zones
sucked.  

Now, of course, many of these things still exist, and still suck.  However,
I personally *like* expanded bank space, soulbinders, no having to stare 
at the spell book, having an expanded rat-maze to move into (LDoN), maps
even.  The portions of TheVision(tm) that have survived are really the 
obnoxious content limiting portions of TheVision.  For instance: VT key, ST key,
VP key, Elemental Flagging Requirements.  So, IMHO, SOE has gotten rid of alot
of the more petty parts of TheVision but kept the really most flawed part
of it.

Seeing folks complain about the "sameness" of the LDoN dungeons is really 
a bit odd to me.  After all, how new was SolB after you'd been there for the
35th time?  Or, now new is that corner in PoV after you've been there for
an hour xp pulling?  LDoN IMHO really did a very very good thing in that
it provided a gear upgrade path for the "Time Starved Powergamer" and the
other casual types that doesn't involve Racing to a spawn, selling one's soul
to the Uberguild Local #205, and having some actually kinda nice stuff given
out with DKPs assigned by the system and not some dufus (or non dufus as the
case may be).  All in all LDoN really seems to be to allow Players more
choice in how to go about their in-game "progression" vs. getting slotted
into a particular track on the SOE Habitrail.
