Actually I'd think you were the moron taking it in the ass with a smile on
you face if you were selling at 25 plat while everyone else was selling for
50. There's no true need in EQ, only your want for plat, & the buyer's want
for your wares, and the value of your effort is determined at time of sale,
not at the time the effort's expended. Get the most you can for your effort,
I guarantee the buyer will get the most he can for his money.
