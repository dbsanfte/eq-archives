I agree. The ideal is to get to a point where there are dozens of viable 
templates.  The trouble however is that balancing templates is much 
harder than balancing classes, because changing a skill to balance a 
template could result in a new and hitherto unknown template suddenly 
gaining dominance.

Classless systems also usually result in virtually every template having 
key abilities: healing for example, etc. This isn't bad per se, but 
reduces group dependancy which may or may not be bad depending on your 
point of view. On the plus side, a group of 6 players... almost 
invariably are a viable group... while 6 of several EQ classes 
frequently are not.

My own preference is to do a skill tree system, like Diablo2, or AC2. 
but with larger and deeper trees, and with some branches over lapping, 
or generic that all classes can take.

It still leads to min-maxxing and templating, but it ensures that the 
player base doesn't boil the system down to 2 or 3 archetypes with 
master templates, and still allows some rebalancing to take place 
without disrupting the entire player base. And it ensures that there are 
at least as many templates as their are base classes.

In a class system the degree to which your character template is gimped 
is directly managed by the developer team. Depending on the team this 
may be a large or small problem.

In a classless system, bad choices, or even suboptimal ones can render 
your character completely ineffective at high levels. You really cant do 
that in EQ.

That is a good feature, and something AC2 did first, so if you 'felt 
gimped' or didn't like the way you were turning out, or thought you'd 
been hit too hard with the nerf bat in the last patch you could roll 
back a bit and try a different approach. Unrealistic as all get out, but 
a very positive game feature.
