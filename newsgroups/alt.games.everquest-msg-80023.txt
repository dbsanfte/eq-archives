I just finished building my new AMD 1600 System with an ATI Radeon
8500 card.  This is the first time I've been able to use my Luclin add
on since getting it for Christmas.  I love the way everything looks,
but a bit frustrated that I keep locking up two minutes into the game.

I've downloaded the latest drivers EQ suggested when I started up the
game.  I have no old video drivers installed, because I wiped my hard
drive and started fresh.

I have a three day weekend coming up and I'd love to get to the bottom
of this problem so I can make up for some lost time.  Any help or
suggestions would be very appreciated.  Thank you.
