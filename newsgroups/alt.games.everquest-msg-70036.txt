Well, I'm at SRo now, over by where the grass begins, by the derv camp. I
was helping a friend to stay alive and then noticed it was really too late
to be going anywhere else. But I got whacked by a crypt mummy that nearly
killed me, had to  run to the zone once. He whacked me as I logged back on.
Somone else told me to try Unrest, but from what I've read of that place,
I'd be dying twice as much.

thanks.
