It says I have to do this for 3.5 years, I've already decided it's a lost
cause but I don't really have anything better to do, so I guess I'll do it
until someone kills me or otherwise prevents me from doing it at which time
all freedom on earth will have been abolished in the guise of freedom.

Hell I was fooled, I thought everything was great, but it's just a deception
we are in the calm before the storm phase. If you notice at the supermarket
you don't even need a card now to get the big "rewards"
