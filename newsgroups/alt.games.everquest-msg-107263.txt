Wrong. The "hello" part is just a greeting. The "what can I do for
you?" is a canned response that gives NO indication that the guide
ever read the petition.

*Make sure you show the petitioner you read the petition!*

Would you like to call a help line, get a recording that tells you to
describe your problem, so you do, then you get a real live person who
just goes "hi, do you have a problem?" Think that is good CS?

When they give the impression they aren't reading the petition... yes.

CONGRESSMAN:  "These reports undoubtedly prove that your product makes
    people die. You are selling things which make people die, but not
    only do they just die, they also become addicted to your product
    for tens of years before they die, thereby supplying you with
    obscene amounts of money in exchange for letting them die."
TOBACCO REPRESENTATIVE: "Yeah, so?"
CONGRESSMAN: "Only us governmental officials are legally able to kill
    people and take their money."
