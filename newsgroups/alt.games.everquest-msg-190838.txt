I'm not a druid (and no, I don't play one on TV either) but I'm still
trying to figure out how you got a succor spell that takes you to 
skyfire? I was under the impression that succor was the same as evacuate 
is for we wizzies. (i.e. that it takes you to the safe spot of the zone 
that you are in, not to some other zone.)

And I don't think you treehuggers get translocates, do you? So I can 
only assume that you were casting the druid version of the skyfire evac. 
(For wizards it's called Tishan's Relocation. Marker's Relocation takes 
you to EJ.) If that's the case, then yes, you can leave a person behind 
on any evac, and sometimes the person who gets left behind is you. It's 
happened to me. Quite embarassing, really.
