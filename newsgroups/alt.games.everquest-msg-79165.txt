Yeah, that wis affects success in trade skills as opposed to int. That
either of wis or int affects trade skill success along with the main
stat (some vagueness there though) Instead its all just for skill
increases. Of course players swear up and down that everything from a
strength buff while doing jewelry helps to a charisma buff while doing
smithing.

"As of May 13, 2001, the following information was confirmed directly
to Niami, by Yakatizma (tradeskills developer at Verant) with regards
to stats and tradeskills. This is the MOST recent information we have
available, despite at least a dozen different message board threads
from folks trying to pull information from old threads, other sites,
etc. When we/I know more, it will be posted here, but please, in the
meantime, accept that this is as recent/accurate as it gets. Debate it
all you want, as Verant has been known to be wrong before, but please,
folks, don't expect me to re-re-re-restate this information in every
new message board thread that you feel like starting. ;) 

INT & WIS: whichever of the two is higher will affect skill increases
when practicing ALL tradeskills. The higher either your INT or WIS is,
the greater the chance you have for a skill gain while tradeskilling.

STR: higher strength will give you an added bonus to your chance at
gaining skill increases while smithing. 

DEX: higher dexterity will give you an added bonus to your chance at
gaining skill increases while fletching or tailoring.

CHA: higher charisma, along with faction, will affect your buying and
selling prices with merchants.

Stats have no impact on your chance of success or failure when
practicing tradeskills. (Only your current skill is supposed to impact
your chances of success or failure when creating an item.)

Yes, this is subject to change/debate, but until otherwise corrected
by Verant itself, this is the last official word we have on the
subject."
