The huge problem I would have with this is that it was already hard
not to outgrow your skills.

Recreated my original bard as a kitty a week or so ago - just gave
him some minimal hp type stuff, since good armor prevents defense
raises, and to good a ratio weapons hurts offense/weapon skill raises.

Even so, It took to level 5 for 1hs and offense to max and 7 for
defense.

I truly think they overdid it, and are fixing these xp bonuses
however.  They were taking down many newbie and low level dungeon
zones today.
