I got where I could browse the web and I read this does work under XP, 
which is what I am running.  I'll find out tonight if that applies to me.  
Athlon 1800+, 768meg RAM, GF4 TI.  I'm a little worried about my Audigy, 
but I'll yank it if it's a problem and replace it with one of the various 
Sound Cards that are lying around.
