Am I correct.

  According to the official rules  and Verant

          No one owns a camp site.  Just because a group has camped the site
before you or your group arrive.  I does not mean the "own" the camp.   They
can ask you to leave, but you can choose to ignore there request.

           As long as you do not "kill steal"    (Attack a mob after someone
else has engaged the mob in combat)
They can call you names and complain but they can not make you leave.

     Some players consider forcing a camped group to share the sight is bad
manners, others say not sharing is bad manners.

           MY OPINION IS:  If a site is camped it is generally a good idea
to just let be and look for another spot to camp.

     If all the sites in the zone are camped and you are having a hard time
finding anything to hunt profitably and efficiently,  there is nothing wrong
with forcing a camped group to share the camp.  If they do not like it then
they need to camp a less popular site.  I think it is foolish for groups or
players to sit around for hours  waiting for a group to invite them or for
the group to give up the camping site.

                  Again one should try to avoid conflict but  I think it is
bad for the game for players to act as if they "own" a prime spawn. This
allows the law of supply and demand to balance things out.  Prime spawns
will be multiple camped.

           I am new to this game (1 month) so I may not know what I am
talking about.  I am basing my opinion on my limited experience. If you
agree or disagree, I am interested in your reasons (i.e. why it is bad for
the game or good for the game)
