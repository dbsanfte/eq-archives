I just got the Everquest Trilogy release for my son. It's the first
online-only game that I've ever bought. I've been trying to install this
thing for about five days now... with no luck. The Patcher is verison
1.0.30, and it always hangs up on this file:

   EQLS_window_pieces_02.tga

Everything before this file downloads and installs just fine. When the
patcher gets to this file, it sits there and does nothing. The system
doesn't freeze, and I can close the patcher, but I CANNOT get this file.

I've tried pretty much every trick I know, including updating the GeForce FX
5200 Ultra driver, uninstalling the game, running regcleaner, doing a manual
registry search, etc... , all to get a clean uninstall so that I can start
over. When I do, the same thing happens!

Can someone tell me what to do? I'm about ready to give up, although my son
really wants to try this game.  :-(
