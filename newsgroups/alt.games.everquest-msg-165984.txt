Just one more thing: If their name gets changed, *I* didn't ruin their
day. They brought it on their own damn self by willfully ignoring the
naming policy.

In fact, I'm not even the one who changes the name. All I do is bring
it to the attention of those who are responsible for changing the
name. THEY decide whether or not it's in violation and warrants
changing. So don't give me this childish crap about how I ruined some
snot-nosed brat's day because HE felt compelled to name himself
"Toaasterr Ovvenn".

It's called "accountability", people. Shifting the blame is childish.
No, I'm not a 100% by-the-book stiff, but what I'm saying is if you
choose to break a rule, accept the consequences if you get caught on
it and don't try to blame anyone but the person who made the choice to
break the rule in the first place. YOUR actions, YOUR blame.
