You're playing a non-healing class.  What did you expect?  Don't remember
when you had to heal all the pure casters in your groups on the way to level
52?  It's all part of SoE's grand plan to have all the different classes
contribute various aspects to groups.  They don't generally encourage
soloing.  Not to mention, enchanters are fairly tough to solo; not
impossible, just tough.

Now, if you need to heal yourself as an enchanter, I'd advise that you start
working on your bandaging skills.  Maybe buy some healing potions, etc.
