 I doesn't even have to be a different key. If F3 has a pet I should be
able to target it by hitting F3 twice. Once targets the player and the
next toggles to the pet if one exists. I don't play a pet class but I
think that's how it presently works for pet owners. They hit F1 to
target themselves and then again to target their pets. That doesn't seem
like it would be hard to change for all group members.
