My take on bards:  the ones that prefer to go solo usually end up solo. 
They'll join our groups but quickly become restless and move on.
Bards that enjoy grouping are so *easy*.  They'll pull if you want, or not. 
They'll play the mana song or healing or buffage or bardspeed or whatever and
DPS too.  
They don't have a lot of group requirements.  They are just fun to have around.
 :)   
Personally I can't figure out how they do it.
