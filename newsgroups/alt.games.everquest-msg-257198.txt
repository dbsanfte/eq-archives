Yes, that may be true during the OOW era, (I have doubts I will mention 
in a moment).  But do you really think it will continue to be true after 
the next expansion, or the next after that?  You're asking me to believe 
that they are going to stop developing bigger and better weapons, thus 
taking the major driver for mudflation out of their hands...they've 
never shown that sort of restraint before.

Lets examine my doubts, then.  Epic 2.0 is supposedly something 
questable which you can either do straight up or via shortcut improving 
your current epic.  For most of the player base, the current epic is 
achievable with difficulty, requiring some high level friends but not 
particularly well geared ones.  Only about 1% of the population is 
getting into Time and high end GOD gear.  Since Epic 2.0 is supposed to 
be a draw for the next expansion, I find it hard to believe it won't be 
achievable by say 20% of the population; the people who are level 65 and 
can field a raid sized force of people that level.

But say they require a raid sized force of 65s in high end GOD gear. 
Now fast forward 6 months, when most of that 20% we talked about before 
are level 70, and the high end OOW stuff is being cracked by the 1%. 
That 1% got their epics upgraded to 2.0 5 months earlier.   Are you 
telling me that the weapons they see dropping off the very peak of OOW 
stuff aren't going to be an improvement over what they already have? 
Forget the next expansion, if every high end warrior is weilding his 
epic and that isn't going to change no matter what happens as the top 
end guilds (which are apparantly the only thing the Devs really think 
about) progress, that would be pretty stupid.

Not that SOE are above stupidity, but this sounds like the kind of 
stupid that will cut off the money spigot; SOE prefers the kind which 
function as a carrot or a stick.
