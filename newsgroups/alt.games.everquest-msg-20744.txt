Dude, you have no idea who she is. She has a kid. Just lost her husband.
She's moving. Why on earth do you want to get involved? 'Cause she
plays EverQuest?

You have no idea what she looks like. You don't even know her.

I suggest putting EverQuest on hold for bit. Take a break. Get a few
dollars and go to club. Dance, drink and mingle with the real world.

We've got faith in you.
