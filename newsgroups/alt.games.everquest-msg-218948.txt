Now while one tactic would be to balance out the rates of nuke
and heal usage, this theory doesn't actually require that the two
be linked; its interesting to note that as long as neither ever
reaches FM or OOM, its irrelevant whether they stay lock stepped,
or whether the nukers go crazy on every other mob, while the
healer gets to rest a bit on those mobs but has to heal
significantly harder on the even numbered mobs which don't take
nuke damage at all, or something even less structured than that.  

This means that as a nuker, you can probably ignore the healer
and nuke as you see fit as long as you never flirt with OOM or
FM.  Nuke only the ones with low resist to your most efficient
nuke?  Good idea, let the healer sweat out the resistant ones,
the group actually comes out ahead, as long as you make it easy
for the healers when the more swattable mobs come along.

But it also means that communicating your relative mana levels to
the group instead of just to the puller may be wise; if the
nukers see that the healer is starting to struggle they can turn
up the heat for a bit, if he's having it too easy, perhaps its
time to catch up on mana for a while.
