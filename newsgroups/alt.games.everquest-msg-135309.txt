Thats irelevant.  I said if the shaman doesnt have mana, the pull doesn't
happen.  I didn't say the raid is held up long, just that it IS held up, and
not just because of clerics.

Ok James, you have 1 shaman on a RC raid who just died (or cast AE focus)
and has ZERO mana.  Do you still pull RC that very instant, or do you wait
till your shaman has the mana to debuff and slow him?

Your 2 mages just died for some reason or another, there are no mod rods,
and they have just been rezzed so totally oom.
Does your guild still engage The emp/AL/whoever at that point in time or do
they wait until the magicians have some mana to get a mod rod supply going?

You said first, "magicians self buff is the same mana regen as clerics self
buff"

But then end it by saying clerics are bottom of the heap alone if you don't
include other class buffs (modrod, c3).. bottom of the heap alone, but at a
same mana regen rate as mages? :)   Btw necro and chanter mana regen is both
dependent on mobs being there (to either lifetap or ToT).. so if solo and
oom, this isnt really an option.

If I am in FG with my cleric and monk, the cleric never ever drops below
90m.
If Im in FG with the shaman and monk, the shaman has to canni every 2 or 3
mobs (after a while of fighting that is)

(no attitude intended with my post.. but im sure your used to how i write by
now heh)
