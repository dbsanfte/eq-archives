As a ranger, my toon finds snare pulling very handy.  Once the beasty
has been snared and aggros, he can practice hitting him with bows and
arrows.  It's moved up his archery skill quite a bit and usually
manages to take 1/4 to 1/2 off the beastie before it comes running up
to play.  It's a dandy opportunity to DoT them, too.

He usually dispatches any blue with a few whacks of dual wield/dual
attack and nary a point of damage taken. 

If he's taking on something with talons, like griffawns, he snares it,
fears it (panic animal spell) and then practices with the bow until he
gets bored and then melees it into puree.

The simple answer is that snaring them upfront reduces the likelihood
of snare being resisted during the fight, precious time to cast taken
away from smacking them with sharp objects or big rocks.

Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any shall note itï¿½. Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle.
