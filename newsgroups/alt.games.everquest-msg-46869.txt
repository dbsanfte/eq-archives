I've found several pages that list the different commands (some pages
have more than others).  But I recently read  a thread that said he
had his pet with Notaunt and the other person had taunt on....
I have not seen any command for taunting:

What is the command, whats the pro's and con's of using this command?
Are there other commands similar that are maybe a little more obscure
like the taunt command?

as usual, Your time is appreciated.
