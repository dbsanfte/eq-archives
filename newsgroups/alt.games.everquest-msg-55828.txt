With all the silk I was able to acquire this weekend, I decided to crank my 
tailoring up.  I have a friend who collected some MQ pelts and made the 
studs for me, and I had collected quite a few in NK recently, so I worked 
on Studded Leather Masks.

I was working with a 192 INT and was at skill level 52.  I was using 
EQtraders' guide and was under the impression that the masks ( and all St. 
Leather ) trivialed at 56.  I went 3-for-4 in skillups right off the bat, 
getting me to 55.  No trivial message.  After that, I did at least 25 more 
combines and did not get a skill-up, nor did I get the trivial message.  I 
sent a tell to my guild buddy who has been tradeskilling, and he said his 
info said that they trivialed at 55, so he went on to cured silk.

I looked at your page ( /point lokari ), and you have the trivial listed at 
57.  Something just seems wierd with mine apparently stopping at 55.  I 
know it's possible that I just didn't get a skill-up, but I am doubting it 
until I see someone else try it.

There is no question that the Random Number Generator in EQ is a bunch of 
shit, with the way skill-ups almost always come in bunches.  Because of 
this, I made sure I didn't rush through all the combines to make sure they 
didn't fall on the wrong side of the RNG curve.

If anyone else is close to this skill number in tailoring, when you do the 
studded leather ( assuming you go that route ), please let me know when you 
trivial the masks.  I'm really curious as to whether I had a really unlucky 
streak or if the masks stop at 55 and just don't give a message.
