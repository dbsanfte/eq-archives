Well, I have 4 cats.... 3 indoor, and 1 out.  All are fixed.(or broken
as it were).  I have my cats fixed for several reasons.  We have male
and female cats in the house..., Male cats typically do not spray when
they have been fixed. (I say typically, because, the outdoor cat we
have Used to be indoor, but he refused to stop his practice of
spraying.... well everything)....
Substitute for responsibility... sure you can twist it that way...  In
reality its like reading a Religious text.  Each person will get their
own interpretation out of it.  My twist on it is... I am doing the
right thing... cats are not breeding, My house don't smell like cat
piss.... and well... the indoor cats don't have a strange desire to
get out every time the door opens.
