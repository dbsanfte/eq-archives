This is one of the parts of my epic I still have to do. But as it is
right now getting people to come kill random seahorses until it spawns
is not really an option. They'll come kill one up things like Ulump
but a boring camp like this guy...

So I am asking, will ANY seahorse spawn him? If I can go in and solo a
spot or two until one spawns and THEN call for help, it would be
really convenient.

Any other suggestions are welcome as well.

Thanks....
