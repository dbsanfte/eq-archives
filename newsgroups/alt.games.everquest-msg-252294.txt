Ah, I see.  Well, at any rate if they'd ONLY raised the cap, and not 
added in ways to make it more efficient at the same time, it would have 
made time between kills longer.

With those changes, it would almost be worthwhile to solo a warrior, if 
it weren't for the fact that long before they did that they raised the 
grouping exp bonus to the point where I doubt this closes the gap back up.

Splendid
