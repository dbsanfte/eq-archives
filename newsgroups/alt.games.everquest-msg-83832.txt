I don't think so.  It's just that there are so many bears there and a large number
of newbies = tons of players looking to get paid 9 copper a pelt :)

Also, the pelts can get covered up by other items in the inventory, and can
accumulate hidden there.  There are techniques for uncovering those items,
but it takes some plat.  Essentially you buy up a slot with cheap, player-looted
stuff in it, like bear meat.  Once the merchant is out, sell him one of the pelts you
want to buy, like a ruined.  If that item appears in the slot, you may be lucky
and will be able to buy all of the pelts of that type off of him.  If you don't have
one of the type you are looking for, you'll just have to take your chances on what
the merchant will choose to put there.  If you don't get what you want in that slot,
you may have to buy that or other items out to uncover more slots.  When you're done,
you sell back all the cheap stuff (at a loss, of course).

But only "merchant dive" after the server's been up for a couple of days, becuause
I hear their inventories get reset on reboots and patches.

I got a stack of mediums off a merchant in Everfrost once. I was so happy
because I was poor and knew I could resell them for a lot more than I paid.

In EC they are common.   You can often get spider silks from EK, because
the crag spiders drop up to 6 at a time.  You may have to merchant
dive there too.
