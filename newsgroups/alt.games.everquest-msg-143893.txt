    And you know the kicker?

    The merchants in OT outpost are rip-off artists. You could have got even
more cash than you did.

    Go to another merchant if you can. You'll get much better prices. My
shaman sold her first round of Brute loot at OT, and the second set in Grobb
before buying new spells. The difference was quite large.
