   You've gotten the answer this question, and I'm happy for
you.  But... please reconsider if you are planning to use it to
spam your group with a cutsie message evertime you cast a spell. 
It might be funny as a clumsy cat around an aquarium the first
time you spam it, and maybe even the second and third, and what
the hell, I'll even give you a fourth.  But it will get beyound
tedious around time 20, I promise you.
