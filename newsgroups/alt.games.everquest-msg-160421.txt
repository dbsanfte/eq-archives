Wizards get "level bonuses" for their DD spells, so the red con
isn't that big of an issue, at least not for the AC.  (He's only
level 35ish.)

My wizard could *solo* him at 34 even though it was red, so I'd
guess a 30ish group with a tank to keep it off the wizard and
provide some damage would be good enough, especially when you
consider the ability to snare/root/fear is there in a wizard,
cleric, warrior group.
