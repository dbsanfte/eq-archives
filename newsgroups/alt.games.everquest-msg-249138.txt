	I think there are two interleaved discussions here.  

	One is "How has POK transport diminished the game?"  I have 
trouble understanding how it has; surely holding down the W key and
pointing the mouse for 1/2 an hour at a time does little for player
or any other kind of interaction...

	The other is "POK itself by allowing players to ignore important
RPG elements such as faction has diminished the game."  I have no trouble
understanding that at all, and  absolutely do wonder why my dark elf
can walk up to a cleric of Tunare and buy spells in POK.   But what did
people do before that?  Didnt they make level 1 alts of the appropriate
race to work around faction issues?  How many people have a level 1 DE 
just to buy hate stones?  

	And for all the damage it may have done POK offers an important 
social construct:  that of the town square.  Having a central meeting place
for people to gather is very important to encourage social interactions.
So there might be a mitigating factor to the other effects.

	It's always been a great disappointment that there's precious
little role playing or attempt to willingly enter the fantasy world.  Then
as now, most people are only concerned with leveling and getting better
gear.  Admittedly, 10 or 12 weeks of killing rats 5 years ago
doesn't give me a great deal of perspective, but the types of interactions
people choose don't seem to have changed all that much.

	Tha's a different problem.  Sony only cares about revenue; they
care nothing about quality whether that's quality of code, customer service,
or content.  They make cookie cutter levels becase it's less expensive.
They'd still make cookie cutter levels if you had to run there.

	Dunno.  I've been playing for a year and a half now, about 16 months
longer than I did the first time.  Will I get bored after I get into
a time guild and kill all those guys 10  times? Maybe, but I can't answer
that question right now.
