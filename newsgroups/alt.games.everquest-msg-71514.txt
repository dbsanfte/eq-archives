Funny, last I checked a shaman was a priest, unable to wear "caster" gear.

I guess we can go with your definition though.  Means this game is quite
caster heavy, then, with a grand total of *3* classes that aren't.  And all
the discussions about casters not getting good gear upgrades with Kunark
were obviously wrong, as caster-rangers, caster-shamans, caster-clerics,
caster-paladins, caster-bards, etc., all got good equipment upgrades.

Nah, I'll stick with the accepted "caster," "priest," and "fighter"
designations.
