Long, timed spawns like that can actually be easier to deal with so long
as they are in a spot where folks are not likely to sit and wait.  Since
you take out the placeholder, only you know when its due to spawn
again.  You can pop in a few minutes early, take it out immediately and
get the heck out of dodge till next cycle.  I took that route to get my
Barb Shaman his horns and it worked wonders.  Of course being in front
of an EQ enabled PC every 8 hours like clockwork for 6 days was a bit of
a challenge between work and real life obligations but horns are hard to
come by and worth the effort involved <G>.
