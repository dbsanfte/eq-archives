Hot damn!! This was a fun read. Go, Jerv, go. If you folks want to get
really serious and slough the dead weight of illusion follow the
swastika back through time to its birth in the Indian Ocean. When you
get there I'll be scraping the barnacles off another tablet for you.
please do try to keep things in context. If you can endure that you
might then have the fortitude to delve into the South China Sea. God
is Love which fulfills Law.
