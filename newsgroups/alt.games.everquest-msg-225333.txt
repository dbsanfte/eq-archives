 >Sometimes you just die :-P

And, you know, I'm *fine* with that. I'm not pissed that
I died, I really expected it, to be truthful, because
the level range requested was 55+ and I'm not quite there
yet. Just my own reluctance to put the mission in danger
by being incompetent, that's why I'm asking. Just to be
*sure*.

 >First off - level is at least as important as resists, if
 >not more, for determining if you resist an AE.

Noted. And understood.

 >Second - even with decent resists/HP for your level, you're
 >going to get hit by the AE.

Yep, knew that.

 >How were heals for non-MA melee to be handled?

There's where I think it happened. Had two healers in
my group. Myself and a 65 pally <?? I think. He was one
of the non-guildies that were there and I didn't really
pay attention to what class he was> were the only other
two members. One cleric, for whatever reason, died even
earlier than I did. Almost immediately, in fact. I was
kinda all agog over just seeing my first 'real' dragon
up close and missed just exactly what was going on with
her. :P The level 65 in our group was, IIRC, third tank
and up front and getting a lot of damage done to him.
Our remaining cleric was, most likely, concentrating on
keeping him alive and missed my steadily declining HP.
I haven't done any of these before. So far, the raids
we have been on have been a little slower paced, the
mobs we were after weren't so in your face, death on
a dragon's breath kinda mobs. There has always been
plenty of time to say 'Hey, I'm getting a little low
here.' This was just so FAST!!

And, at the same time, my little level 53 butt was
expendable and keeping the tank alive was the most
important thing, so I can understand that, too.
