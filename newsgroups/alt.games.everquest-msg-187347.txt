Dead language?? I'm not talking Latin here. I was talking about Farsi.
And I wish I had learned a little more when I had the chance because,
here in L.A. they pay almost 100K for people that speak and write it.
Far from a dead language. And I never objected to DT's name. I only
was pointing out that if you change the context of the name it could
fall under the guidelines of a bad name.

Nuff' said.
