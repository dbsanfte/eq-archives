Get thee hence to the Jagged Pine gnoll caves. (Evil gnolls, not the
good ones with the bank.) Compared to other mobs of their level, they go 
down faster than a hooker when the fleet comes in. Also, they armor and 
weapons they drop sell to vendors quite well. My partner and I often 
cleaned up there to the tune of three or four hundred plat a night. The 
ZEM isn't too shabby and until 57 or 58 the xp comes in pretty fast.
