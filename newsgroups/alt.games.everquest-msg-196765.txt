They are definately not all on the same faction.  My troll was OK to
the guys on the DSP (or Maru Seru) side but KOS to the guards on the
other side.  I was lucky and the guards weren't right at zone in. 
They started running at me and I was able to backout in time.

There are two entrances to the zone from DSP (it is a Y type
entrance).  If the guards are clustered at one, then you can use a
non-KOS character to drag the body to the other zone in point.  The
other option would be to drag the body across the zone to the zone in
at Maru Seru.  The guards at this entrance are generally back a bit
from the zone in point.
