Thanks to you and Wolfie for telling me about the Lucy site.  I'd never even heard of
it.  Looks very useful, though.

   I just a couple of levels ago tumbled onto the notion that Celestial Remedy is a
Good Thing.  Lots of healing and draws low agro!  But I had it a couple of levels
before I figured that out.  *sigh*

Yeah, but they might notice if I get myself and everyone else killed.  Good clerics
don't let that happen, right?

In the bank.  And the brutes are wonderful.  Unfortunately, they are often camped,
even on FV.  Not that it really matters.  Lenny and I spent a level hunting
gargoyles, and got about a stack and a half of eyes.  Plus we started out hunting
sisters in OOT.  And our guild was pretty generous in equipping us, so we haven't
really had to buy much yet.  We have about 800 plat banked, which on that server at
that level is doing pretty good.  But it doesn't hurt to have too much bank!
