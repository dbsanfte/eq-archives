They don't have to be allergic.  Maybe they have asthma
(VERY common) and the shortness of breath caused by
the hot sauce triggers an attack.   Maybe it's something
else.  All that matters is you committing a major felony in
response to something that's -- at most -- a misdemeanor.

You're not being turned into a victim by ANYONE other
than YOURSELF.   If you put a $5 bill in the fridge would
you expect it to be there hours later?  How about a $10 or
$20 or $50.

Take *personal* responsiblity.  If you're not willing to lose
something, don't leave it in a unwatched, unsecured location.
If you do, you only have YOURSELF to blame.

To put it on-topic:  you're the idiot who decides to train
someone because they're taking 'your' mobs.  That's okay
for some people, but most people -- and the GMs (in
this case the police/DA) -- are going to think you're
over-reacting.

But, hey, if you're willing to spend 5 or 10 years in prison
over losing a $2 lunch you're not willing to secure yourself,
who am I to argue?

You're right.  You're the type that breaks a $50 for a drink at a
bar, leaves the change on the table, and gets all pissed off when
you come back from the restroom and it's gone.  It's the SAME
thing -- if it means something to you, don't leave it laying around
for anyone to take.  Duh.  Most people learned that in the 1st or
2nd grade...
