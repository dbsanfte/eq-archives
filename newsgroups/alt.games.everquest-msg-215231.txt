No, a drum is not a drum.

All drums let you use your percussion skill to modify most percussion songs.
This is always a big boost over not using a drum while playing that sort of song
("humming the tune" I call it)  But in addition to this, most drums have some
degree or other of bonus modification.

These effects are easy to see using a song like Chant of Battle.  Note your
Strength.  With no instrument, start humming Chant.  Now look at your strength.
Now equip a common drum, like a storebought "hand drum".  Look at your strength
yet again.  Now try it with a good drum, and your strength should be even
better.  Marginally so with a Combine Hand Drum (store bought in Katta
Castelum), much improved with a Walrus Skin Drum (usually about 500pp in the
bazaar)

This improvement will translate to faster selos, more resists from songs like
Elemental Rythms, but most importantly, to damage from your percussion based DOT
chants, which don't start until level 30.  Up until you have a few of these, any
drum is pretty much as good as any other, yes your bard with the best drum is
the best runner, but "faster than mobs" is really all you need, and resists
matter little at low levels.  Once you get enough chants to twist, though, your
drum quality is the single most important item you will own.

That said, there's precious little difference between a Walrus Skin Drum, which
is a fairly common drop in Sirens Grotto, and thus usually on the market quite
cheaply, and a Selos Drum of the March, which drops sometimes off Naggy and
tends to go for as much as 10Kpp if you can find it for sale at all.  Save up
for a Walrus, and don't worry about the March the upgrade is extremely small and
the cost is prohibative, unless you happen to win it while killing a dragon.
