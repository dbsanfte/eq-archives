It is just as odd you act like an extra unpaid employee to police verant's
rules. Rules may be rules, that doesn't mean it is your place to make sure
they are followed.

It was relavent to figuring out what your problem was (the rest of this post
was good enough I guess, you just don't like the name).

I noticed that after, my mistake, if you post in a public place like usenet
though you're open to responses just the same.
I'm assuming you do not use "Lokari" as an in-game name? since that too
would be a violation of the rules.
