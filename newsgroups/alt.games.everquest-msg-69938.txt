Pretty much.  From the Nov 7th patch message:

"Fixed a bug that allowed corpses to get stuck inside walls while
creating a phantom corpse at the zone line (on your client only)
with which you could not interact. Now if a corpse ends up in a
location that is not 'valid' the corpse will be moved to the 'default
coordinates' of the zone. Also, the /corpse command will now
summon your own corpse to you anywhere in the zone as long as
that corpse is on the default coordinates. As a rule of thumb, if
you died near a wall and cannot find your corpse where you died,
try /corpse before petitioning."

I'd say since the necro can locate the corpse somewhere in the
zone but not see it, it didn't work as the patch intended it should.
The reason for the /corpse command change was so you wouldn't
run around (and /petition) looking for a corpse that had been
moved by the game engine.   Now, if it fell into a invalid location,
the corpse is moved but any /corpse summons it.

I'd be not, since the engine didn't put them there by mistake.  I'd
wager it's impossible to drag your corpse into an invalid location.
The only real way to know is if you drag it, then it suddenly disappears
out of /corpse range.

Besides, you bind the rogue up top.   He can then drag from anywhere
to the ditch, go hit something and die, spawn at the top, run down and
drag them up from the top of the ditch.   It works perfectly well.
There's no reason to do the recovery at the ditch.  In fact, it's fairly
more dangerous to do it there than to drag them up top and fight
back in.
