Agreed. The person whose idea of 'paying for a port' was giving me 2
silver (immediately before he headed to Gfay to auction off stuff,
which my alt saw) was the fastest ever addition to my NoHelp list.

If you can't pay something 10 pp, say you're too poor to donate and
just ask nicely. It might take you longer to get the port, but you
won't offend the porter.
