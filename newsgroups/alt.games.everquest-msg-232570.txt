Greetings.  I can't get www.magelo.com support to respond to this one:

Many moons ago, I installed Magelo Update.  Then I uninstalled it a
week or so later.  After that I couldn't load any www.magelo.com
pages.  Attempting to do so results in the browser acting like it
doesn't know what file type the page is.  Forcing it to read the page
as an html file produces a half page or so of unreadable alphanumeric
characters no matter which page I try to load.  Other web sites are
not affected.

I did as the www.magelo.com faq recommended and cleared the browser
cache and deleted cookies, updated the browser (MSIE) and OS (Windows
XP), but this didn't help.

What's strange is that I copied my My Documents directory to another
computer and now I can't load magelo.com pages with that computer
either.  It produces the same symptoms as the other one.

Anyone know what could be doing this?
