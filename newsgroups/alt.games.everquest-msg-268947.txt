The definition of inane has obviously eluded you.  When you acquire a better
grasp of the english language, feel free to continue this conversation. 
Though it will be obvious at that point that you shouldn't, because it would
be "inane".  =P

Your attempt at wit has all been done.  Along with increasing your
vocabulary and reading comprehension, I hope you also learn the concept of
originality and thinking for oneself rather than regurgitation of some
derogatory witticism that was already old when you learned it from it being
used on you.
