Ahh....Tell me something, what the FUCK is it going to hurt to tell
how much RAM you have? They could quite legally find that out
themsleves more than likely if they wanted to, but little whiney
pissants like you would pitch temper-tantrums over it...

So, again....what harm would it do to tell them how much RAM you have?
What vital profile into your life is that going to give them? What
critical secrets? What risk is it going to put you at? Are you really
so paranoid as to think they have some sinister plans behind asking
such a simple question that could, quite honestly, help them target
the system specs of the majority of their users which would, in fact,
help US?
