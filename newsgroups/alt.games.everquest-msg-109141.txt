To an extent, but there should be some correlation.  If a mob cons blue,
then I should be able to take it down more often than not (assuming no
adds).  Mabye not an exact measure (this mob has a combat prowes of 812, or
something like that), but a good idea of the ability.

I should not be in a position, like I found myself in in Dreadlands.  I con
a plaugebone thief.  It says blue, so I swap to my ghoulbane, put up my
buffs, and throw an arrow at it.  Two bubbles of the theif's health later,
my LoH is spent, and I'm getting a lovely view of my corpse while I'm
waiting to return to my bindpoint in shadowhaven.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
