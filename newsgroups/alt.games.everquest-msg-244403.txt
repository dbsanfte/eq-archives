In response to the line Marry Poppins quoted:

>>do that would make high end groups want them?
Being a fun person to hang out with.  All my groups these days are based
around enjoying spending time with the people in the group while earning xp
and/or adv points.  I do have a list of people that I will not group with
again based solely on their personality.  If you can tell a few jokes or
just have some interesting conversation, then people are more likely to want
to group with you again over some other higher dps class unknown person.

In response to Marry Poppins:
What is your argument?  Yes there are classes that do more dps than monks -- 
rogues and wizards being the primere classes for melee and magic
respectively.  Yes there are situations where monks are not the best class
for pulling mobs and there are situations where they are.  What of it?
