Suspicious man attempts to lure young girl into car 

 Police have released a composite of a suspicious man who allegedly
attempted to lure a young girl into his car earlier this month.

On several occasions earlier this March, a suspicious man parked across the
street from a school bus stop at southwest Alexander and southwest Alicia
Streets in Aloha tried to lure a 10 year-old girl into his car. 

He told the girl, "I know your Mom, it�s O.K. to get in my car."

The suspicious man is described as Hispanic, in his late 20�s to early 30�s
with a mustache and bushy eyebrows. The girl also said he was wearing a
white baseball cap.

The vehicle he was driving is described as a red early to mid 90�s Toyota
with a narrow black stripe running along the mid-section of the car from
front to back. Detectives say the narrow stripe is possibly rubber door
trim.

Similar reports of a suspicious Hispanic man sitting in a red car near
schools or playgrounds have been reported in the last few weeks in North
Plains and Hillsboro.

New roadside memorial goes up for slain Tahoe girl

CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) - After repeated vandalism, a new roadside memorial
has been installed for a young Lake Tahoe murder victim. 

With the help of a crane, a 1-ton metal cross went up Saturday near the
spot where the body of 9-year-old Krystal Steadman was found two years ago.
The cross features a heart with Krystal's initials. Toys also were left in
her memory. 

Three previous memorials at the site along U.S. Highway 50 west of Carson
City were desecrated. 

"This memorial is made of solid steel and concrete, and I'm confident it'll
survive," said project organizer Gary James. 

"Krystal had such a short time to enjoy life, but had to endure such pain
and misery ... To me, the memorial is not only for her but for all children
that have suffered untimely deaths." 

James is a friend of Krystal's father, John Steadman of Gatlinburg, Tenn. 

Krystal was killed at Lake Tahoe in March 2000. The man charged with her
murder, Thomas Soria Sr., committed suicide in the Douglas County jail in
January 2001. 

The first memorial to the girl disappeared in October 2000. The second was
vandalized a month later. 

Earlier this month, vandals damaged a cross made of wood and train rails
with a chainsaw, and tossed toys into a nearby canyon. 

Stormy Stone, 9, of Carson City, was among about 30 people who watched as
the new memorial was installed. She left some of her favorite toys. 

"I wanted to come to support the family," she said. "This memorial is
special to us." 

Krystal, a fourth-grader from South Lake Tahoe, Calif., disappeared after
Thomas Soria Jr. lured her to the apartment he shared with his father in
Stateline, where her mother was visiting friends. 

The child's nude, battered body was found the following day along Highway
50 about 20 miles away. Authorities said she was raped and tortured before
her throat was slashed. 

Soria Jr. is serving a no-parole life term for his role in the crime.
