I will concede the distinction and allow for the possibility that you
are correct...

Except if you don't happen to be listed in one of the categories that
it is illegal to discriminate against.

Then let's make the LAW reflect the way it SHOULD be...

And those exceptions defeat the entire argument of yours..

How can there be equality under the law if there are exceptions??

Ahhh Sorry, I shoulda picked up on it anyways...

If there is an anti-discrimination law and one can prove
discrimination for WHATEVER reason, not just the reasons that other
people have listed, then you have the law to protect you.

OK Let me put it another way and hope you can understand this...

Are there possible catagories of discrimination that are NOT listed in
the current anti-discrimination laws..

Of course there are..

So, what happens to a person who is discriminated against, but he or
she doesn't fit into any of the listed catagories??

He or she is SOL..  

And THAT is not equal protection under the law...

I stand corrected.  I should have been more clear insofar as I was
referring to the United States.  It has been quite a few years since I
have lived in other countries so.....
