My experience with Grimrot seems to go with the above, although I'm not
100% sure about killing at a particular time. I killed a PH Putrid
Skeleton at 12pm (midday) gametime and the Live Grimrot popped just
before 8pm, was killed at 8pm (with help) and another popped about the
same time (3hrs later). Killed that one at 8pm (after calling guildmates
in to get someone who needed the Scythe).
Was absolutely amazed when a third Live Grimrot appeared 3 hours
later!!!

About a week later was there when a 51 Pally killed the PH, came back 3
hrs later and the Dead Grimrot popped at night time in game. Luckily for
me the Pally wasn't online at the time, so I was able to kill him, was
easy too, was green to me at lvl 40.

BTW Live Grimrot killed me at lvl 40, first time. Needed a Druid to
assist with healing me to take Grimrot after the CR.

Oh and one more thing, kill Raiders and Bandits that are dotted about
the Karanas while you're waiting for the next pop. Then run the Red
Bandit sashes to Qeynos for faction, plus Bone chips can be handed in in
Qeynos. Got my faction up to Ally with the Preist of Life, by doing this
during a total of 3 weeks camping Grimrot, evenings and weekends.
