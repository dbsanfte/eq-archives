I'm sorry, I don't see anywhere in the text you quoted where I said
"YOUR statement".... However, your explaination in your first reply
did convey the message. Perhaps not in those exact words, no, but
close enough.

SOrry, the "view" Dan and yourself are referring to is a bit of an
extreme stretch. Druids and Shamans are religious leaders in their
societies, just as Clerics are in theirs. There's no way around that.
They fill the role in their societies that clerics fill in theirs. Any
view that denies that is plainly ignorant of the facts, either
willfully or otherwise. Paladins are to clerics what rangers are to
druids and beastlords are to shamans. If you want Paladins to get a
CHeal type spell, you may as well try to wrangle ports for rangers and
top of the line shaman slows/hastes for beastlords.

Sorry, how can "Yes, paladins are closer to being clerics than druids
and shamans" and "No, paladins aren't closer to being clerics than
druids and shamans" NOT opposing each other?

You know, you really are clinging rather desperately to this "WAAAAH!
YOU INSULTED ME!" tripe. Drop it.
