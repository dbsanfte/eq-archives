Hi Tracey,

That's good to hear. I am hoping that after the buzz of trying  the
new EQ2 and WoW has died down a bit then folks will realise how good
EQ and DAoC really are. I'll probably stay with WoW until I hit the
level cap and have done the high level instances, and it is an
enjoyable game to be fair to Blizzard, but I certainly hope that more
folks do come back. I'll certainly be keeping my eye on changes in EQ
and DAoC and will probably re-subscribe periodically to check things
out.

BB.
