Here's my method...

Make a hot key like this:
/sit off
/pause 15, /cast 3 (Cana slot)
/sit

The cast time of Cana is fast (1second), so waiting 1.5 seconds will give
time for the spell to go off properly.

1) Cast Regen on self.
2) press cana hotkey
3) open inventory and watch for the health to jump
4) press cana
5) rinse, repeat

You are sitting for the mana and health regen timer and you can add those
extra 20 pts of mana each click, also.  Makes the medding process much
faster and looks funny to all around you (unless in bear form, of course).
