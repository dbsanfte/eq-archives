This is probably the best feature of EQ!  The world changes all the
time!  Nothing is constant.  Why else subscribe to online game?  If
the game did not change it would just like any other 1st person RPG.

Being in sofware dev. for last 7 years I can tell you that the test
env. will find at most 70% of the bugs.  There is a huge difference
between few hundred of testers and thousends of users, users usually
do things that you do not expect!  SOE did best thing they could have
... release a patch for what was missed in testing.
