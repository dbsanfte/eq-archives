Some friends of mine went to the new Hate plane last night.  Revamped
Maestro dropped a 1hs, prim/secondary, delay 20 dmg 15, 10 to a bunch of
juicy stats, 85 hp 85 mana, effect of Poison Shock, WAR PAL RNG SHD.  My
warrior-playing roomie saw the link on my screen and he's of the opinion
it's better than the warrior epic - well, better than half of it anyway.
Me, I'm a wizard/enchanter, what do I know?
