Yes, you go to mountains of rathe over to the area behind the main HG
area where it goes to the ajoining Drake area with a spinx up on the
drake mountain. Behind that by the zone border is a new structure,
kind of an open fortress with many high con dark elfs (up to level 63
or so) The guy who starts the quest is over on the left, the captain
someting.. the npcs by him such as the half elf tell you to talk to
him.

You talk to him and say things like "what dark lady" and then he says
something about do you want to help us in brackets. The thing is you
don't say it exactly the way he says it in brackets because that gets
no response. You have to say it all screwed up using I in the first
part but changing the pronoun in the second to us or something.. I
forget exactly but remember when seeing it again. Then you give the
note he gives you to Xel something who is the lady in the FBR with the
mage pet nearby who does not respond to hails. 

She then gives you a note to take to Izera in sro, a dark elf in nice
looking chain with her bottom hanging out and that dark elf in sro
gives you nothing in return because it seems broken there.

Oh, and you are max allied to primordial malice if you've ever killed
that dark elf wiz people kill in neriak somewhere, or any of those 3
necro women near each other a bunch. Gix and dorn also raise it now,
not sure if they always did.
