Personally, I've always thought that EQ was Monty Haul-ish.

And with 60 experience levels to reach, plus AAXP beyond that(who knows what
will happen with the new rumored expasion), I really don't see where making
it easier for players to make 1-10, plus making 1-30 a bit easier for the
casual player, makes things any worse.
