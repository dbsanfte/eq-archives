That's not a troll thats a frustrated user.

This happens to nvidia too.... hmmm.... if someone said their nvidia 
wasn't working ... would you call them a troll too and then help them 
get it working again (since most people with cards going back all the 
way to geforce2mxes can still play fine so its not strictly nvidia 
causing "the problem")... or would you tell them its because their 
nvidia card can no longer run eq and that they should immediately pickup 
a 9800...

Oh wait, we already know the answer to that.

/ducks

j/k ... not looking to start another debate on that topic... but you do 
seem a touch biased -- the *original response* you gave this guy would 
have been appropriate and helpful for the nvidia poster a while back too.
