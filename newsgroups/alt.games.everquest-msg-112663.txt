You're simply using what I used to refer to as "the poor man's
teleport". No, it's not an exploit or any such thing. If you're willing
to take a death to save the trip (and particularly if you can mem your
spells faster than it would take you to zone three times) then by all
means go for it. Back before any of the new "dumb down pre-level 10"
changes, I made the run from Qeynos to Kaladim with my monk to bring
some stuff to my wife's new Dwarven Cleric. (Man, this is going back a
ways.) I did the entire run naked, since monks fight hand to hand
anyway. When I got there, I got the things out of my bank, made the
delivery, saluted her briskly, and attacked a guard. I was back in
Qeynos a few seconds later.

This method will become less appealing later on when you see how much
experience and unrezzed death will cost you at higher levels. But for
now, enjoy!
