Perhaps the break was in the time of LDoN. Perhaps it was PoP. People
didn't have to cooperate with the larger group, just within a pocket.
I think LDoN and the pop teleport model really changed the nature of
the game more than I liked.

I think another nail in the coffin is zero CS and the rise of the
scam. Back in the day, our server GM would have gotten a casino scam
shut down in nano seconds, or a scaming buyer getting an ornate for
30k COPPER pieces, would have been keel hauled. Now it takes this
ticket and a few days. Give me back our server assigned GMs!!!

Even today, the boats are mostly gone. Most of Timourous deep is a lot
harder to get to. Mudflation is rampant, BUFF-flation is a big problem
(dood_01 says, "porting out for an HoV, a C3 and a SoE"), and the
player base is more about minimaxing a character than developing a
reputation and a personality.

I hope he is clued into the changes to the way the game is played and
not just the changes of how it is played. The culture of EQ is
different from the game mechanics.
