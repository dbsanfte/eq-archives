I am reposting this, which is a post I made on the Paladin's Of Norrath 
board. I've gotten only one response there. Since there seems to be a 
higher volume of traffic here, I'm hoping to get a bit more feedback. 
The response there was to simply wait until I'm level 25. Curious if 
that's the take here or not.
--------------------------------------------
  First off, here is my current buildout:
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...um=1068593

As you can see, other than my Truthbringer armor, I don't have much in 
the way of magic items. My sword and hammer are both unmagical, as is my 
shield.

All the character buildouts I've seen (including the one on this forum) 
start at level 25 and up. I'm only level 12. I feel like I must be 
missing something considering I don't have a magic weapon, magic shield 
or any magic trinkets to speak of.

I'm interesting in collecting some magical items, but I'm not sure how 
to go about it. I'm currently on the 30-day trial so I don't have access 
to the bazaar, I am buying the platinum edition tomorrow though. But, I 
don't want to *buy* my stuff, I want to earn it through doing the quests.

How does a newbie to EQ figure out what he needs? I've looked at 
alakazam and some other good EQ sites, but they don't really break the 
items down by class/level that well. Plus, they assume you know what the 
heck you're looking for. The problem I have is that if I look at the 
list of weapons for Paladins, for example, there might be 600+ items. 
How in the world am I supposed to sift through all that to find the one 
weapon that is appropriate for my level and is available within the 
first 3 expansions (since I'm on the 30-day trial) ? I'm just finding it 
all very overwhelming at the moment.

So, any advice anyone has about what equipment/weapons I should have at 
my current level (12) or just a resource that doesn't assume you're a 2 
year veteran with a few level 65 toons on a few servers.

Thanks!
