    The WC druid portal used to have big problems with people not moving
from the port point. So some small race would port in, end up stacked on top
of a large race, and would bounce up and down in "fall mode" on top of the
large race character until someone moved or deflected them. They would then
take falling damage computed on how long they spent bouncing in mid-air.
Killed more than a few people.

    That would make too much sense. =/ There might also be some oddness in
the engine that precludes such a calculation, like every trip down a
staircase would be visually displayed as a series of falls or teleporters
would kill/heal people if they jumped on them as opposed to walking onto
them. The teleporters one sounds like the most likely reason, as there's a
few of them in the original game.
