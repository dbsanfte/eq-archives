This is high on my list. I have about 35 of the threads, and no biles.
We're currently getting the biles for a friend, and after that, we'll get
them for me.

Yup, my CHA is rock bottom.  I've followed the discussions on how much CHA
affects charm / mez / etc, and I still haven't decided how much faith I'm
going to put into it.  I will probably be trying to keep my INT at around
200, then try to raise my Mana, HPs, number of ( useful ) focus effects I
have, then CHA.

I haven't decided which skill to take over 200, yet.  When I do, I will
eventually go for the GM trophy, but getting there takes more cash than I'll
have any time soon.  That's a long-term goal.

I'm working in this as best as I can.  I have all the ones that I think are
necessary and constantly look for the rest at reasonable prices.

afford it.

My play style doesn't lend itself to having a lot of cash.  I like to
tradeskill, I like to help others, and I like to explore.  I don't like
doing EXP camps for many hours on end.  I still do them when I need to, but
prefer not to.

There are people in this newsgroup that enjoy thinking about upgrades and
enjoy helping others make decisions like the ones I asked about, and this
gives them the opportunity to do so, while helping me out.  It's a win-win
situation.

No one is doing "research" to reply to my query, nor did I say I wasn't
interested in doing any research.  Helpful people are taking a glance at a
profile and replying with what they already know.  They reply with
information they already have because they want to, not because they are
being asked to "research".  There's a distinction there, and really not that
hard to grasp.
