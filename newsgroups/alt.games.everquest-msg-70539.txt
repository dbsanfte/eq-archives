Much snippage done.

Incidentally, Dan, this ALSO seems to be Jazz's reaction to everyone who was
screwed over by this. Apparantly, Verant's fuckup is also the consumer's
fault, in addition to Microsoft's. /boggle @ people who can't simply admit
that Verant did something very, very wrong

*shrug*

Oh, and Jazz? I've just spent over a thousand dollars of my wife's money to
get myself moved down here, us married, and continuing to eat/be online, and
we can't afford to buy Christmas presents for our friends/relatives. Tell me
exactly how buying new computer parts/OSes is a viable option?

I challenge you to do it without making yourself look like a complete
jackass, because frankly, I know you can't.
