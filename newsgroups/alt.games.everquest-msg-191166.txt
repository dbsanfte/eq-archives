Over the past 3 years, I have done research on the psychology of
MMORPGs. You can find my past research at: http://www.nickyee.com/hub/

A new issue of "The Daedalus Project" (a regularly updated collection
of findings and articles) is now available:
http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/

Also, two new surveys are available for current MMORPG players. There
is a short multiple-choice questionnaire that should take about 3-5
minutes to complete. And there is also an open-ended survey on a
variety of game-play issues and memorable experiences. You can find
these new surveys at: http://www.nickyee.com/mmorpg/main.html
