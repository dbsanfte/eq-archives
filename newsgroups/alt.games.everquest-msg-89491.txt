You chose a Dark Elf

Dark Elves are evil and proud to be evil. More, you are a necromancer. Why
would you want to become a friend of these stupid druids. If you want to be
the good guy, play an high elf paladin or a wood elf ranger ;-)

Seriously, the best help i found for factions is in Allakhzam site. But the
described factions are not sorted by zone but alpha. A good way to see on
which faction a NPC is, is to kill him... but i think its not what you want.
