>Why is it awful?  It'll outdamage the Lammy past L50, so anytime he doesn't
need to work at gaining/holding agro it's superior.  Seems to me to be a
situational call, depending on the mobs he's fighting and his role in the
group/raid.  Best efficiency would probably be achieved by keeping all three
weapons and using Wurmslayer/Lammy or Lammy/Centi depending on how difficult
it is to hold agro when he's tanking.

Aye my job for the better part is always to pull/agro mob.  Usually the MA
in most simple guild raids, but second-of-choice in larger more complicated
raids.

>Of course, a better solution would be to get a high damage 2hander and
switch between that and the Lammy/Centi combo as appropriate (in which case
your advice to ditch the Wurmslayer makes great sense), but he didn't
mention 2handers in his post.

Right now I carry around a BABS. 24/39 I believe. Not too shabby.  But I
think I could find something better.  I also prefer not to have/carry proc'
weapons.  Should I stick with the Centi Longsword and Lammy combination? or
go ahead and get a wurm (use it every so often or when called)? Any
suggestions as for an awesome 1hslashing weapon?  Any ideas and information
please!

Thanks again guys,
