Speaking of which, I wonder if the following mobs have been attempted: 

Kazon Stormhammer
Antonius Bayle
King Ak'Anon

I do think city raids should be more of a feature of EQ... Just make the
guild trainers and the quest-givers spawn fast enough not to make a raid
too much of an inconvenience for newbies. Of course, merchants are
already safe, since they are not worth fighting, and won't aggro on you.
