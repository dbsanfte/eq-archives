Yeah, I really thought it was my ISP or something similar, except that
I have 3 different ISPs which are all working for everything except
EQ.  I've gone so far as to even change my ethernet card now, to
ensure that I could put it on it's own non-shared IRQ.  (Guess there
was a reason to keep those old pieces around.)  
The more I think about it, the more convinced I am that this is
related to the last patch.  I haven't been able to play since then,
but since that happened as the WTC was coming down, I just naturally
assumed that it was network related.  Also, my ISP was down, and I
wasn't sure of the quality of the two additional ISPs that I signed up
with to test.  After 4 days of testing and troubleshooting I'm about
as convinced as can be that the problem is with EQ somehow.  The only
thing I haven't tried is to find one of the servers using their second
connection.  Guess that's next.
