That part ties in nicely with some of the other posts in this thread where
people are bitching about clerics wanting reimbursement for rezzing.  How
often is a cleric *NOT* in a group past level 39?  I mean, unless they're
working on tradeskills or something, I imagine they are pretty much *always*
in a group fighting. When some poor dead bastard comes running up dragging
his corpse and needs a rez, it can drag the entire pulling process to a
halt.  That's now as many as five *other* people that you are shutting down
while you get your rez.  Still think clerics should do it for free?
