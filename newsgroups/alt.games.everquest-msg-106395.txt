 It's a no brainer really, if they wanted to stop twinking they would have
designed a game with one character per server. The biggest question though
is, why? What's wrong with twinking?

The only people who object do so out of jealousy, so screw'em. Jealousy
isn't just envy of someone with better gear BTW - it can be envy of someone
with equal or lesser gear who the jealous person perceives to have not
worked hard enough for them. It doesn't even have to be of items, it can be
of skills and abilities too.

If you play the game like a pissing contest all the time - you miss out on a
lot of the fun. Anyway, each to his own.
