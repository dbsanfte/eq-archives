It's an informal, player-invented term, so it can mean
anything anyone wants it to mean, but usually it means
hitting a skill of 200.

Verant gave names to skill levels from 0-100, but left
all skill levels 100+ to be called nothing but "master".

So players decided there ought to be a name for having
reached "double master" level (200), and started calling
it "grand master".
