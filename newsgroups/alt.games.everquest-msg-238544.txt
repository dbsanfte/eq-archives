No offence but I've had friends tell me stuff like that and I've never 
taken it as a come on of any sort, and they've never meant it as such. 
Now I can't really talk as when I was a lame-ass young teenager (note I 
say 'young' as my teenage years are in no way far behind me) I would 
have had trouble with this concept, however the clues that they aren't 
meant as a come on are always very very subtle. This is why keeping 
online flirtations as just that is a good idea, as the clues just don't 
come across online.
