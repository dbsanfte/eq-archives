Ok, this may sound kinda silly but...

I've seen several casters weilding an item that has an in-game graphic
of what appears to be an open book mounted to a staff. Overall, kinda
cool looking, IMHO...and perfect for my vain little human mage. 

My question is....WTH is it? I know there are several items with this
graphic, some are NO DROP,  but I'm sure there has to be a couple out
there that are droppable/tradeable. 

Any help, wild guesses, thoughts and ideas would be appreciated!
