Jeez. I was a *half elf* ranger and I used to bind in Oggok. How
much harder could it have been for an Ogre? I take your point that
ogres required much more preparation given faction issues, but at
a time prior to the insane mudflation of modern gear Ogre racial
advantages were also seen as pretty huge, and faction was meaningful.

I *did* have a dark elf necromancer too, and really... Faction was
a good thing. Bemoaning that Ogres were harder to play than other
races is whats led to the new EQ1/EQ2 style of 'Any race, its just a 
pretty graphic anyway' approach.

Yeah, well, exactly. Its not like elves had super faction with Trolls
or Ogres. I'm not sure picking the hardest possible example in EQ1
'traditional' (say, Ogre Shadowknight, love that 40% xp penalty!) and
using it as an example is a great idea... I (personally) prefer a game
with variety, and difficulty. It shouldn't just be a case of 'balance
it all by making everything as easy as possible', especially not when
there are easy options available too.

And no, before you stare at me like a lunatic, I am not suggesting
racial/class penalties were valid very long after release ;) The great
nerf bat came down on hybrids and said 'you shall be balanced with the
pure classes!' and it was sucky, verily ;)
