Having gone through what is now a standardized progression of zones doesn't 
mean that a player will be incompotent at playing their class.  I wouldn't 
say they leached thier way to 50, they grouped and earned 50.  I'd define 
power leveling as using a more powerful character to assist a less powerful 
character in gaining xp at a rate that wouldn't be possible without said 
assistance and with no benefit to the more powerful party.  If someone logs 
into Greater Faydark kills some skeletons and orcs, then goes to PC, MS, OT, 
DL, PoJ, PoS, then BoT or some other route of zones in which a pick up group 
could be found. then that person may be ignorant of the breadth and depth of 
zones and mobs extant in EQ, but it does not mean that they are neccesarily 
an incompotent player, unkowledgeable about game mechanics, or that they 
didn't enjoy playing EQ up to the level that they have earned.
