As a furry lover, I have to say EWWWWW!  I really cannot stand the Kerra.
This is the only model I preferred in EQ-L.  They look like chimpanzees,
not cats.  I know cats. I live with two and I"m a biologist and artist, so
I understand form and bone structure and musculature.
Those...those...*things*...are not cats.  THeir ears are shaped like bears
and set too low.  They have chins for crying out loud. Their noses aren't
shaped right, and their eyes are set too close together. The only thing
they got right was the sharp cheekbones and the fur.  They look like
people who have that rare genetic disease...y'know, the guy from Beauty
and the Beast TV show.

Guh...you set me off there.  Kerra SUUUUCK in EQ2!  I really don't get it.
The ratonga's have rodent heads. The iksar have lizard heads. So why can't
the kerra have cat heads?  Instead they get this freakish feline/human
hybrid thing that just looks fugly.

*stomp* *storm* *fume* *pout*

I've noticed that human males with facial hair tend to look very nice, but
the clean-shaven ones look a bit beady eyed to me.

I think the direction they took with Half-ELves was unique, to say the
least, and I like it in most cases. Unfortunately they look almost nothing
like I imagine Foxeye to be.  Whereas the high elves do. Sooo...unless I
get a surprise once I receive the CD myself, I"m going to be coming up
with a story for why Foxeye is now a high-elf.  Which is no biggie, since
I already had to explain her being immortal now. :P

I love the look of the entire row of violets...not just the flowers, but
the leaves, stems, and all...probablyroots as well. Wood elves evidently
have soil for brains. ^_^
