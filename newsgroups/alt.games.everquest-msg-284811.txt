However, in this case, the term "lag" would seem appropriate, as it applies 
by definition. The graphics subsystem falls, or "lags", behind in rendering 
the images (or changes in the images) to the screen, thereby causing frames 
to be dropped. Tomato/tomato and all that.

Don't mean to be argumentative. I just thought it was an interesting 
distinction.
