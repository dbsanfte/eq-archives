My point was that if only the people wealthy enough not to need to work 
had kids

Since when did having kids mean that you weren't allowed to have an 
intimate romantic getaway with the girl of your dreams?

  and leaving them in day-care every friggin day, even
> when they aren't working? 

1) Kids often have friends at day care.

2) A day care situation like that is usually pre-paid so the money is 
spent whether you send them or not.

3) If they're in a good daycare you might be enriching them far more 
than if you kept them home.

I agree that parents need to be involved in their kids lives 
wholeheartedly, but day cares and unincluded vacations aren't a valid 
litmus test for good parents. Keeping the kids home all day while 'Mom' 
serves up TV and MacDonalds is hardly an improvement.

I am suggesting there would be a serious shortage of children. And all 
that that entails for the future of the nation.

I actually don't even recall that. If I'm responding to your posts its 
because they're interesting or controversial, not because I have some 
bizarre need to harrass you.

No. I agree with that sentiment (always) "that it is important to be 
involved in your kids lives". However I think the implied conclusion, 
"if you're going to put your kids in daycare, don't have kids" is both 
unrealistic and flat out wrong.
