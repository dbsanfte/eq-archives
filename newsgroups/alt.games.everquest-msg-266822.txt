G) Certain "special rules" servers like the Zeks and Firiona Vie, work 
with wildly different access to items.  Perhaps excluding them from the 
pool would be necessary.  Then again, does EQ2 even have special rules 
servers?

Another advantage to this scheme; it makes server contraction (a widely 
speculated upcoming event for EQ1) simple; you only keep as many servers 
running as you need.

Too, you can take a server offline for maintenance without interfering 
so much with any of your players; they can move to a different server.
