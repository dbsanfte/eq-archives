No sure that I'll be getting to England any time soon, either. It's always been
like that as far as I can remember, though as I said it's relatively mild (from my
perspective), so it may have developed over time and I just didn't realize it. And
I don't have all that much age for it to have developed with, really. Although I
suppose in my late 20's I've probably already passed my peak vision.
