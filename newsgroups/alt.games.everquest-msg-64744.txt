To my knowlege Diablo II does not have 2-3000 players playing simultaneously
in a single instance of the "world".  Norrath is a PERSISTANT world. Diablo
is Static/Random.  Norrath EVOLVES, Verrant is constantly adding new stuff
(much for no additional charge), new content to make the world more
interesting.  Diablo is very good and fun but does not change much each
playthrough just some randomized maps and random items.  Diablo expansion
provided a single higher resolution mode, 2 new characters, some new items,
and some minor GUI enhancements.  This upgrade to Norrath Includes a new
Graphics engine, Higher resolution textures worldwide, new zones, new class,
new race (all told over a dozen new race class combinations), new spells,
new items, new skills, new advancement options...

Do I need to go on about why this might be more complex than the upgrade to
Diablo?

As to the free service,  Diablo II requires slightly less maintenance  than
the persistant world of Norrath.  And it was your choice to accept Verrant's
monthly charge for EQ,  there was no gun held to your head.  If you resent
the fee so much, quit paying it.  It is a pay by choice service.

It is not a "non-argument".  If I am unhappy with my burger, I POLITELY
complain to the cashier/manager, and GIVE THEM TIME to prepare me a new
burger.  I do not go whining and complaining to total strangers that they
are ripping me off, and treating me like shit without giving them the
opportunity to fix it.   Burgers take a few minutes to fix.  Computer games
take a little longer, so I must be a little more patient.

One further difference is that I am a chef, so I know how a burger is made
and what they need to do to make one.  I am not a software designer so I am
NOT going to try to tell them how to do their work.  I will let them know I
am not happy, and then give them time to fix it.  If they dont, I will
cancel my account.  If you think you have the right to tell them how to do
their job you obviously think you could do it better, that is why I said "go
do it yourself".  They will deliver what they promised if we give them the
feedback and time necesary.  Posting trash talk to a NG is not feedback.

One point to this expansion was to provide new content for longer term
players.  Had it been released as a separate game it would have failed in
that.  The new game would have attracted many new customers to it, but many
would stay with the old so now they would have the expence of maintaining 2
separate sets of servers.  Trying to develop new content for both, and
eventually they would lose more customers that they gained because their
resources would be spread too thin.

By upgrading to have some "uber requirements"  (not really, I can still play
basic EQ on my 350, with a voodoo banshee and 64megRam which is not that
great a system, tried it 10 minutes ago) they are making this game
competitive with games that are coming out today, They are once again trying
to "push the envolope"and give us an even better game.  Yes some people will
have to upgrade to continue playing  IF THEY WANT TO.  It is their choice,
Verrant is not forceing anyone to play.  It is their world their servers,
their software and they are selling us the right to use it.  And they are
trying to provide us with a game we will enjoy and want to continue playing.
Our recourse if we dont like what they are doing is to NOT PLAY/PAY.  This
is the ultimate arbiter because if enough people are dissatisfied they will
quit, and Verrant will go out of business.  It is called Capitalism and is
based on reward for merit.

Boy would I love to be your employer because you obviously never have any
errors in your work, and you never make mistakes and every deadline is met,
and every job is done perfectly the first time you try it, and you must
never need training, and you never hurt yourself, and you never get
sick......  Boy you are the perfect employee.

/sarcasm off

People are NOT fired for making mistakes or having errors,.... they are
fired for NOT being able to correct them.  Anyone who is an employer will
tell you that PATIENCE is the first skill a boss has to develop.  human
beings make mistakes, good employees know how to fix them.
