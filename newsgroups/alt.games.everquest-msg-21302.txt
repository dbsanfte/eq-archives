Unfortunately, the drachnids are pretty stingy with silk in my
experience. And they're a PITA to hunt for exp, due to their
self-buffs (they're rangers) and their widely varying levels,
at least in FV.

I bite the bullet and head to EK when I feel the need to gain 
another tailoring point or three. I have heard the heart spiders
are nearly as silk-rich as crags, but have never tried them.

And I always carry steel boning and mask patterns. You never know
when you'll find a load of HQ cat pelts at a vendor.
