I have found you need to switch the log file on each time you log into the
character.
Not sure if they are going to be looking into this or not - in EQ1 you were
able to switch it on and it stayed on (files could get quite large however).

If you're not sure of your sponsor, here's a link to their website:
http://www.leagueoflevity.com/, you might see a familiar name in the roster.
 See you in game =)
