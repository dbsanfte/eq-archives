U2
Walk On

And love
It's not the easy thing
The only baggage
That you can bring
Not the easy thing
The only baggage you can bring
Is all that you can't leave behind               ( when you enter Paradise
:-)

And if the darkness is to keep us apart                ( trib :-(
And if the daylight feels like it's a long way off      ( 8th eternal day )
And if your glass heart should crack
Before the second you turn back
Oh no, be strong

Walk on
Walk on
What you got, they can't steal it                ( salvation ! )
No they can't even feel it                         ( ain't that true ! )

Walk on
Walk on
Stay safe tonight                                    ( darkness of rapture
in 6th night Mt 25 )

You're packing a suitcase for a place
None of us has been
A place that has to be believed    ( heaven true ;-)
To be seen

You could have flown away
A singing bird
In an open cage
Who will only fly
Only fly for freedom

Walk on
Walk on
What you got
You can't deny it
Can't sell it or buy it

Walk on
Walk on
You stay safe tonight

And I know it aches
How your heart it breaks
You can only take so much

Walk on
Walk on

Home
Hard to know what it is
If you never had one

Home
I can't say where it is
But I know I'm going

Home
That's where the heart is

And I know it aches
And your heart it breaks
You can only take so much
Walk on

Leave it behind
You've got to leave it behind

All that you fashion
All that you make
All that you build
All that you break

All that you measure
All that you feel
All this you can leave behind

All that you reason
All that you care

It's only time
And I'll never fill up all my mind


All that you sense
All that you scheme
All you dress up
And all that you see

All you create
All that you wreck
All that you hate
