Nope, I didn't.

I did petition when the fiber cables getting cut was announced and I was
going LD every 20 to 30 minutes...  Reason:  VI knew they were having
problems.  I was trying to play and got killed 2 times for it because of
LD...  the rep simply said "we are not responsible"...

As for the LD keep fighting, I was reminded of back prior to the first PvP
server being set up...  LD meant you were dropped back then.  PvP folks
would disconnect if they got in trouble to keep from getting killed so the
"keep fighting" code was added.  I'm not asking for a lot when I say, on
'blue' production servers, simply put back the old code...
