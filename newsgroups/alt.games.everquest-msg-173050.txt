Been a while since I did any parsings.. infact, it was the last time
somebody started a debate on here about it.

Well since then I've upgraded a weapon, and today finally got around to some
exping (and a good time to parse again!)

Main hand -
Fangs of Vyzh`dra
Skill: Hand to Hand  Atk Delay: 19
DMG: 17  AC: 15
DEX: +10  STA: +10  WIS: +15  HP: +75
MANA: +100  SV FIRE: +15  SV COLD: +15  SV MAGIC: +15

Glowing Mithril Ulak
