Rangers get dual wield at 17.  Could be this was a true newb who didn't realize
he should be using 2 weapons.  At 57 my ranger always dual wield, only changing
to a slow weapon if I get agro.  
On the more relevant side, I put a ranger on my *ignore* list for standing back
and shooting arrows in a *hard* dungeon where we needed DPS *big time*.  When
asked why she wasn't in meleeing the mob she said she needed to work on her
archery skill.  She certainly did, she sucked at archery.  (She also wasn't
buffing, or backup healing when I was LOM, and she kept *forgetting* to snare
the mob and damage shield the warrior and keep chloroplast on us.   We'd be
sitting around medding at half health and she wouldn't heal even then, tho she
said she had full mana.  She said she didn't have it memmed.  Absolutely
*nothing* pisses me off like rangers who don't do their job - they make all of
us look bad).
