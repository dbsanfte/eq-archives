Other respondants have given you class specific descriptions of this,
but its not strictly for necros.

Step one: snare the mob (druids, rangers, necros, SK, wizards and Bards
all have snare capability naturally, while several other classes can weild
weapons that proc a snare effect as well)

Step two: Fear the mob (necros, clerics, SK, bards, and enchanters can
do this naturally, rangers and druids have fears that work only on animals,
and several other classes get a limited Fear capability in a skill called instill
doubt or fear proccing weaponry)

The mob now walks away from you slowly while you kill it.  Usually this
is done via Melee... beat on its defenseless back.  But its also possible
to Nuke or DOT or use arrows... point is it moves slowly and doesn't hurt
you while you do it.
