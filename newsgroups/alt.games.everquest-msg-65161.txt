My guess is that Verant would like to see EC and GFay revert somewhat to
plain old newbie areas.

The beauty of these zones from a buyer/seller standpoint has been a
combination of factors:  ease of access, extremely low threat level from
creatures/NPCs in large and/or siginificant sections of the zone, ready
access for many buyers/sellers to bank services.

The bazaar, to my understanding (I am in Europe and won't see Luclin before
the weekend at best), matches or beats EC and GFay on the access to banking
thing, pretty much matches them on ease of access to the zone, and it seems
it will want to match or beat them on safety issues.  If the zone weren't
safe for all newcomers, the zone may not take off as the new market for the
EQ universe, and especailly not as a zone where people could be expected to
leave their char unattended for substantial chunks of time.  That
peer-driven incentive for people to buy the expansion would then be lost.
Not that it's by any means the most convincing argument for buying it, but
it is (or soon will be) one of many factors in the decision process.

So if there are any wandering, even semi-powerful mobs, a la Sergeant Slate,
I'll bet the only way to mess up zone faction, if there is any at all, would
be from things done within the bazaar zone itself.  Pure speculation, as I
mentioned above, but I'd guess this is what they'd do.
