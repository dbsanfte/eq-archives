Boats were not a problem as an idea. Boats were a problem because they 
moved slower than you could swim, had endless bugs dropping players in 
the middle of the ocean when they zoned, and waiting for the boat took 
too damned long. If the boats showed up every 5 minutes instead of 30, 
got you to your destination -safely- in 5 minutes, and had a working 
bartender and poker game to join... it would have been fine.

  yelling for binds,

Today most people are bound in the plane of knowlededge or at wayfarer 
camps, so the relevance of soul binders in erudin, qeynos, and free port 
as a 'necessary convenience for high level players' is questionable at 
best. There would be no trouble getting binds from another player in pok 
or at a wayfarer camp today, so the soulbinders are largely irrelevant 
to the highend game.

To each their own. Many things have been an improvement, but many of the 
problems that they've fixed could have been fixed in much more 
intelligent ways.
