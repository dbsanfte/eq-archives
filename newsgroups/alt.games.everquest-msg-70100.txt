Us poor aussies have been well and truely stiffed when it comes to patches
recently.
Basically SOE/VI have been patching every week night since the release of
SoL to squish the many bugs it introduced. While these patches are scheduled
during the quietest time for the majority of players, for us poor aussies it
means basically no EQ during our evenings!
This is unacceptable.
To resolve this untenable situation I hear by declare shananegans on SOE/VI.
Im going to start a petition to threaten them with a class action if they
dont do something to solve the situation.
They MUST solve this terrible problem no later than 5 minutes after you read
this message.
Their consistent patching has forced me to play Diablo2 again. Damn I really
hate them for that one.

Ahhh I feel so much better now.
Any one got some cheese to go with that whine?
