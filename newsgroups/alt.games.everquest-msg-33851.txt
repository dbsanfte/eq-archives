You will find that over your life as a necro that you will almost be
forced to solo most of the time. There are three main types of
feelings towards necros in the game. 1 People are jelous of your
ability to solo and gain levels leaving them in the dust. 2 People
just dont know how usefull of a utility class a necro can be. 3.
People that have hunted with a well played necro and welcome you into
the group.

You will find that there are not a lot of people that know and do play
their necro to its full ability. Thus expanding the group of people
that dont like necros.

A well played necro can snare, dot, dd, life tap, heal others, give
mana, add an extra sudo tank, and mez. 

It takes a bit of practice but very often in my guild during any hunt
or raid that we do I end up doing a bit of everthing while in a group.

Its sad but like druids necros are jacks of all trades but masters of
nothing. Its how you play that jack of all trades that really counts.
