Nope, the Cougars were snared and I was wolfform.  They never got near
the zone line.  As to the Bard comment, everybody's been slamming
Druids for so long, hell I've had more trouble with Bards than Druids,
and I'm pretty sure I got trained by this particular Bard, I dodged
his BS a couple times as well.

No, he didn't, see above.

Hey, I was in a bad mood, five unrezzed deaths (3 to lag, tho one was
pretty suspiciously like being trained, one to bad luck, and one to
lack of caution) made my Druid's weekend a wash for xp instead of
gaining a level as I had hoped.  You expect me to be more rational
than you are?  (pointing to your complaint about making levels in PoP...
<making> levels you're whining about ferpetesake!)

Yeah, yeah, Cel already told me about the shawl part.  I was kinda
surprised to see mobs that tough anywhere in Iceclad.  Shame you
guys had to be so quick to ruin my rant, I was just getting started.
:-p

My main has been a Half Elf Paladin since a couple days after I first
played the game.  That said, a disproprotionate number of the jerks
and morons I've run into in EQ have been Half Elves, mostly either
Bards or female toons (oddly not often both).  Either that or I'm
prone to remember those particular jerks more than the others.
