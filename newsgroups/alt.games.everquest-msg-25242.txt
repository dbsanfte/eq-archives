Actually, I don't expect ANYTHING. That's why I pointed out that I
don't blame Verant for EQ not being a good roleplaying environment.

I think it's very difficult to construct an online world that lends
itself well to roleplaying. A world in which characters can never
really die, and mobs constantly respawn is by its nature unrealistic.
You can't permanently reduce the population of Blackburrow with a
concerted attack, because you know the gnolls will just respawn. This
isn't Verant's fault, it's the nature of online games. 

I was never complaining about any aspect of EQ, just pointing out the
difficulties that I perceive with the roleplaying aspect of the game.
