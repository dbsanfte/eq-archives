I have to admit, this article really made me angry. What a stupid,
frivolous lawsuit this woman is filing to further clog up the court
system! The mother of this young man, by her own admission, *knew* her
son had serious, preexisting neurological and psychological problems;
yet, she still wants to blame a game for his death and is going to sue,
no less! Gee, it's just not possible that he committed suicide because
of chronic illness, depression, schizoid personality disorder and the
chemical imbalances in the brain that go along with them. It couldn't be
that not enough was done to provide him with the professional help he
obviously needed, could it? Or perhaps that he was one of those people
who simply refuses take care of their medical needs? (Playing EQ despite
the fact that it triggered seizures for him certainly indicates to me
that might have been the case; the day I fall on the floor in a video
game induced grande mal fit will be the day I uninstall EQ, for crying
out loud!) No, none of those are reasonable explanations; it's Sony's
fault! I suppose it just goes to show that people will do anything to
deny their own responsibility (and maybe cash in and make a few bucks as
well) in a tragic situation.
