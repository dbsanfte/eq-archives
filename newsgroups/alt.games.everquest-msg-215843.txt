It's strictly linear, not compound.

That's an oversimplification.  Working in a group any particular ding
may not have any noticeable effect on how fast you gain xp (and thus
your next level would be noticeably slower than the last).

Hmmm, let's see.  You lose agro at exactly the moment you cannot move
or attack.  Not gonna make that robe happy, not even slightly.  Also,
as a Warrior you have taunt, procs, and your damage output plus hit
frequency.  No "at will" spells to make up the difference.

And if you're not a raider?  Or you're only rarely a raider?  Where
are you gonna get this 305 unbuffed stamina?

*shrug* My old main is a non-raiding Paladin.  He'll probably never hit
the cap.  His pathetic starting STA is and will be a permanent handicap.
*** _Not_Everybody_Who_Plays_EQ_is_a_Raider_ ***
In fact, as far as I can see, _most_ players do not raid to speak of.
Basing your advice strictly and rigidly on the assumption that every
character will be a heavy raider with "uber" gear and scores of AA
levels makes it valid for only those characters.  What about the other
99% of the player population.

"Arguably" is a worthless piece of shit of a word.  Whoever devised it
is surely damned for all time. As for the rest, there is no greatness
in EQ, just a bunch of people goofing off.
