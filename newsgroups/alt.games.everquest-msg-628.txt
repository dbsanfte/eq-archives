  My Dark Elf SK is looking for an armor upgrade but I don't know what to get
him.  He is currently in Rygor armor all except a hero bracer, crested helm,
and dwarven work boots.  Are any Dark Forge peices better than these or should
I stick with what he has now?  Also are dark mail gaunts bette rthan Rygor or
Dark Forge gaunts?
