After doing the runaround and visiting all the people and places, the quest
tells you to re-read the book.  The text of the book (or somewhere in the
citizenship quest) even says "you need to keep this book to complete the
quest", though I don't know when this text was added.

AFAIK, you cannot complete the quest if you've destroyed the book.  You'll
probably just delete it from your journal when it gets full.
