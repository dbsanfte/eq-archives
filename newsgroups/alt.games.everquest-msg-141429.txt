}Unlimited snake skins are sold by a vendor in Field of Bone near East
}Cabilis.  I'm sure they are there to provide the component for an early
}iksar shaman spell, since there are no snakes (I think) anywhere on Kunark.
}I wouldn't be surprised if there was a similar vendor near Shar Vahl, since
}I can't recall seeing any snakes near there either.
