If you like flames, besides the usual cesspits of soc.men and 
talk.origins, rec.writing.sf is a perpetual flamefest... so much so that 
I actually had to stop reading the newsgroup because I couldn't take the 
heat. It's amazing how every possible discussion in a science-fiction 
newsgroup *will* eventually degenerate into a "Heinlein was/was not a 
Fascist" flamewar, and from there, of course, degenerate further down to 
a gun control flamewar.

Pity, because it's a wonderfully informative newsgroup otherwise. I 
really got a kick of having some of my posts replied to by real, famous 
SF writers.
