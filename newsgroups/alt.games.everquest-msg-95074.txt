I agree.  I went to Lava till level 18 or 19 I think.  The lava snake
thingies are awesome exp when you cant find anything else high enough there.
After that I went to do Aviaks in Lake Raithe and then South Karana,
although in trying to do the same with my daughter right now it seems a
little tougher - I guess you have to be determined!  After 22 or so I was
grouped and killing Gnolls at the paw spires in SK for the longest time -
great fun. After that its off to Cazuc Thull and excellent grouping fun.
