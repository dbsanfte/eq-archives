While I don't think what those soldiers did is right, it is nothing to get
upset about, they are at war, war is hell, any one of those guys would have
killed a US soldier and thought nothing of it, and look what happened to
Nick Berg?? not sure if that is his name but they beheaded him, all our
soldiers did was intimidate and take a few humiliating photos.  Why aren't
the Iraqis outraged about this beheading the way the Americans were over the
photos?
