When you say "ever other piece of software" do you include other
graphics intensive offline/online games? It is remotely possible that
whatever other software you have run does not reach for the limit as
much as EQ2, so substandard performance (wrt EQ2) might not be
noticeable otherwise.

I presume you have:

Looked at what programs you have running all the time on your computer
(i.e. taskbar)?

Checked for programs that constantly or periodically access the
internet or some remote site?

Do you connect via dialup or broadband?

You might want to check the system config (the old way was RUN,
MSCONFIG?)to see what programs get launched on boot up. You might be
surprised at what is being loaded. Having a multitude of programs
running eats up memory, system resources, and cpu cycles which might
impact performance. Using the msconfig (I think it can be launched
through windows as well via system tools), you can switch them off,
all at once or one by one, to see if performance picks up (of course,
you have to reboot to see if the change has any effect).

Having something that goes out into the internet to check for updates
can be problematic especially if the program is not nice to the other
processes. I believe that a friend's computer had some kind of HP
program (that he didn't know was installed) that checked for updates
online and once that was shutdown his system ran EQ much better.

Although unlikely, given your basic system, if you have dialup and use
an internal modem (i.e. a Winmodem or similar "soft" modem) then it is
possible that anything that eats cpu cycles will also affect data
transfers possibly even reducing transmission rates below what EQ2
needs to operate efficiently. If you have broadband (dsl or cable) or
use a hardware-based internal modem or an external modem then this is
not a consideration.

Hope this helps.
