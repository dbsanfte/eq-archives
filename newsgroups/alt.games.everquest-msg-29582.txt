Yes, they are transportation tools. The donations and fees that many
druids and wizards like for their services can be considered
countermeasures to prevent druids and wizards from being treated as
nothing but taxis to serve everyone's traveling whims. 
The fact you're obsessing on - that those classes occasionally have
the nerve to want payment for their time and mana - is only indirectly
related to the fact that that Everquest's traveling system is
*different* from the system in games like Asheron's Call.
