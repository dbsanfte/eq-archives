The ONLY thing I would add the Adventurer Stone to is The Intricate Wooden
Figurine you get for your Planar progression. The Stone itsself is an
Augment so it can be added to the figurine. If you add it to anything else
other than the Figurine, be prepared to get laughed at by higher level
players when and if they ever find out.
