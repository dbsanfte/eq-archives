OK my bad. I was under the impresion that the original poster was a Cleric
since everyone was sujesting the Basic focus items for a cleric and not the
focus items you would want as a necro. Affliction Haste, Affliction
Efficiency, Burning Affliction, Extended Range.  And yes Necro's do get
invis. I was saying that I took my level 1 necro to do the quest to see that
it was still doable, thus needed the invis pot.

You are corect on the pot name.

Cloudy Potion - Insta click 1 use Invisibility
Swirling Smoke is the Insta click Gate potion. Had just bought 2 for my SK,
had my mind filled with smoke after laying out over 2100p for them. I could
have got the 10second Shaman ones for 3K 10 dose, but being on a RED server
that insta click gate has saved my life a couple of times.
