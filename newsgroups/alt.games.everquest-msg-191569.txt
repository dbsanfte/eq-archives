Static spawns - cave of seven tundra yeti's in NW corner of Dreadlands (see
eqatlas map).  There are two caves of three each and one hidden in an alcove
(go in invis to make sure of location).  All can be pulled one at a time
without aggroing any others.  They are on a 22 minute timer, so you'll
probably kill all seven and spend a good amount of time waiting for the
re-spawns, but they are safe, steady xps up to 44-45.  You can also camp the
Hulking Golras on Golra Island in the Timorous Deep - three spawns on a 12
minute timer.  The big problem is going to be Halara, who sometimes spawns
in place of a regular Hulking Golra and is quite a challenge.  Every
encounter I had with her pre-44 was close.

Out and about - Drakkel Wolves and Frost Giant Scouts in the Great Divide,
Dire Sonic Wolves in Tenebrous Mountains.

Do you have your Sol Ro focus items yet?
