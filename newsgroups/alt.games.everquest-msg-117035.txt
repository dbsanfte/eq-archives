Tell that to the poor schmuck in Mississippi who was
actually jailed for sodomy when he mentioned in his
divorce proceedings that during his marriage he
had occasionally performed oral sex on his wife.

That's not an urban legend, somewhere around here
I have his name, the location of the court, and
the date of his incarceration.

You most certainly can be arrested for verbal
admission of having committed an illegal act
in the past.
