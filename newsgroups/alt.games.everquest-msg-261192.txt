Its part of an age old customer service trick to reduce workload:

Make your customers jump through hoops.

Every hoop you make them jump through filters out 3 groups:

1) The group that doesn't know how to jump through the hoop.

2) The group that can't be bothered to jump through the hoop.

3) The group that realizes he will be able to solve the problem himself 
with the amount of time he'd be spending jumping through CS's hoops.
