Simplicity -

Best -

1- Bazaar
2- PoK Travel Abilities
3- Monks Damage points nerfed


Worst-
KEI/C3  Whats the point ? Do people need every possible advantage they can
get even if Verant has to invent one ?

Prices/ Bazaar
 I seen a Dark Reaver being sold for 1500pp. They need to Cap an item just
to save players from searching through all the morons who no nothing about
weapons and armor.

Horses
ROFL, I wont touch that one. Most worthless addition ever in EQ. They were
put here for egomaniacs period.

Lvl 10 exp.
 What, is it that hard ? Many an expierenced player leveled his Toon the
hard way. Is it fair to make it easier now ? This basically made level 1-10
worthless. Why dont we just start at level 10 and be done with it. The best
part of EQ was the learning curve.

Ressurrections
 What a crock these are. Now it seems everyone can rez. Kill em totally. The
first time I got a rez was level 42, and I felt like it was cheating. Now
you have egomaniacs boasting " It only took me 3 weeks to hit level 50, so I
am good" They fail to mention the 744 rez's they got. A rez seems to make
people play without regard to how hard a CR can be. Again, I guess thats an
old school mentalitty, call me lethargic.

New Weapons
 Um, so why quest your Epic now ? It's probably a newbie weapon anyway.
Either fix the Epic Factor, or stop dropping uber weps.

Number 1 complaint !!!!
 " Oh, you have #$%$ problem ?" "You need to go into your EQ files and type
*&^%$# in and it will be fixed"
 I pay money to play this game. How bout you pay me to fix it ?

 Where is Verant heading with EverQuest ? They are making it way too easy,
forgetting all the players who worked hard on leveling, and questing. Was it
really that hard of a game ? I have come to the conclusion that its about
money, and new players. "Forget the players who started with Beta and
basically made EQ what it is today!!!" How bout we start the game with an
Epic, and 100k in pp. Is that where we are heading ?
