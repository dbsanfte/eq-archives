Yeah, we have only 2 bards in the Guild.  1 is usually available to
us, but this was one of the rare nights he wasn't.  The other is
generally less so.  One of our enchanters is leveling a bard on her
2nd account - not sure how far she is.  After 50 it takes a lot
more committment to get them leveled.

Ahhhh - so its the fact they are air.  I have *never* seen my pet 
feared on a dragon.  I have seen him run from a Black Reaver, but
only if he is knocked out of melee range when he's blind.
