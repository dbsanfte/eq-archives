I think you're becoming my bete noir. I dont mean that in a nasty way,
or anything, just that I think every single position I've ever seen
you take here is diametrically opposed to the feelings I have about
EQ. Its illuminating, in a way, to realise two such different players
could obsess about the same game to such a degree ;) Amazing that EQ
has even managed to cater to us both for so long.

I loathe pop. I love its interesting encounters, Agnarr and the like,
the extended scripting, but I hate the 'video game' nature of it, the
linear progression ,the stratification of the player base by huge
differences in gear quality and physical seperation of them into zones
where they dont encounter one another. POK, POP flagging and the
ever increasing disparity between 'raid' and 'non raid' gear kill EQ
for me.. and I say this as a member of a high end time conquering
raiding guild.

POP turned EQ into... space invaders. Forced its conception of the world
on you and made EQ story and player irrelevant and into a 'beat the levels'
fantasy space invaders.

Scars of velious *easily* ranks as the best EQ expansion in my opinion.
It was open ended, the difference in gear quality was substation but
not overwhelming and players still mingled when they levelled and
raided. I remember 3 raids together in TOV, I remember the ubers XP'ing
alongside the casual in Velketors, I remember the incredible world
of the dwarves dragons and giants that screamed character and story without
forcing *plot* at you, let players develop their own prejudices and
preferences, let them actually interact with the world rather than
just observing, consuming it. Even faction had consequences. In leet
speek terms 'Velious Pwn3d d00d!' ;)

Funny. I can see why you like POP. Its just a completely different
game philosophy though... its narriative, consumable, level based
computer gaming. Icky ;)
