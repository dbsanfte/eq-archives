A good start would be to turn on your anon/role flag,seems to be 
a requirement for "high end" guilds.  :p

I myself transfered from SolRo to AB a year ago,players on AB seem to
be more mature.
After the recent merge with the UbiSoft servers its quite crowded now,
its not uncommon to see 150 players in PoK,or 350 Bazaar traders now,
quite nice,I love it crowded.
Maybe if you re-think about your plans to join a "high end"guild and
would like to have some fun,there is at least one *very* active open
raid organisation now,though atm we are doing lower PoP stuff up to RZ
most of the raiders are experienced and long time players.Join channel
ulopen on AB,if you like to find out more.
