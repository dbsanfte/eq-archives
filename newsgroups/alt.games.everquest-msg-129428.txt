Isn't this what infatida I did and caused? And besides the Hezeballah, and
the extremists, (and some right wingers in Isreal) no one wants the utter
destruction of one or the other.

Pali's need to learn better "PR" techniques. When they were playing david vs
Goliath, that was their great photo opp.

They need to go back to that, and comparing their abuses with South Africa
and the presecution of the Jews by the Nazis.

Its also a bad a idea to take your young bright, motivated people who could
go into government and work for a better society, and have them be so
passionate as to blow themselves up. Give me a 100 like minded individuals
and put them into the "spin" and see where they are in 20 years.

It didn't help that Israel's top pick to replace Yassir was the one behind
the bombings in order to get Yassir whacked and he could take power. My pick
for Pali President? That prof of Middle Eastern Studies from
Georgetown....Al-Salwari? She would eat everyone for lunch....
