Speaking of being pissed off, apparently Altopia doesn't give a rats ass about abuse of this nature:
(From: http://www.altopia.com/polfaq.htm )

[Quote]

Q: What is your policy on off-topic postings?

A: We do not have a policy against off-topic postings and we rely on users to operate in a way that
they feel is appropriate for Usenet and/or the groups they are participating in.

Q: What if I don't like one of your customers or what they are saying on Usenet? Will you delete
them for me if I complain enough?

A: No. Also, if you feel one of our customers is using the service for illegal purposes, please
contact law enforcement and not us.

[End quote]

And yet:

[Quote]

Q: What is your policy on cross-posting?  (REVISED 12/3/2001)

A: Cross-posting ability is not to be used by customers for the purpose of "cascading", "flaming",
or "trolling". We may disable the cross-posting ability of a customer if we believe they are
cross-posting with one or more of these purposes.

[End Quote]

Regardless of the last quote, there is no "abuse@" address to be found on their site.
(I have not, as yet, tried to send a message to Altopia at support@alt.net )

So, to (the person really behind) "white_propheta" I ask:
Please, stop posting your off topic messages.
If I want to hear your thoughts on religion, I'll look for you in a religion oriented group.
If you want to post song lyrics, go to a music oriented group.
Politics? You know where to put it. ;-)

Again:
Please, stop posting your off topic messages.
