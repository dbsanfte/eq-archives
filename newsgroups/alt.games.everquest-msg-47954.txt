While this is an interesting analysis, I don't think the parrallel
is truely accurate.  Further, I think the person writing the
analysis is burned out on MMPRPGs, and only playing them
because its his job to do so, leaving him somewhat jaded.

While it is -possible- to play EQ in a strictly rote, repetitive
exp grind mode, leavened only by the quest for self improvement
thru loot garnering, this is far from the only thing you can do.

Consider, as the author does, the casino gambler.  Slot
machine players are really engaged in a grind; they continue,
perhaps, to play the same machine in the theory that this
-next- time the payoff will be there, while if they switch
they will lose all that built up karma.  But there's little in
the way of thought other than that.  This is similar to the
EQ player who fights a standard path of similar always
blue mobs with a set party composition.  Just keep grinding
away.

Now look at the blackjack player.  He has to make actual
descisions based on his cards and the cards visible on the
other player's hands.  Its possible to improve your game,
to do better, even to (thru extraordinary ability) to beat the
house using more than luck.  (oddly, casinos will kick anyone
out that they discover using these means)

Roulette is similar to the slots, but whole books have been
written on strategies for playing... even though its relatively
simple to see that there is no long term winning strategy, the
human mind still looks for one.

In Everquest, though, there are a large number of player
controlled factors at work.  True strategic and tactical
thinking is possible.  Yes, for some mobs, some fights,
the thinking isn't very deep: once you have the basics
of pulling, tanking, aggro control, healing down, this is
a working strategy that can be repeated fairly safely.

But lots of other strategic possibilities exist, from kiting,
fear kiting, root-doting, charming... actually about a third
of the spells and skills available can be used to initiate
new variations of one sort or another (the remainder are
upgrades to existing spells and skills)

If you continue to think about what you  are doing, try new
things, fight new mobs, with different group structures,
different approaches, then you can hardly compare EQ
to a slot machine... or even to blackjack or poker or
even chess.  There's little in the pre RPG world to compare
with the possible variation and complexity in EQ.  The
fact that leveling and getting new loots are carrots simply
gives you goals.  At higher levels, with better (or just different)
loots you gain new options, and can face new mobs.

Just as often, you see people getting bored at one stage
or another switching to an alternate character.  Is this
because the other character is even more uber?  No,
patently false, even twinked out, that character is by
its nature less powerful than your main.  If EQ is a slot
machine, why would anyone do this?  Its not, its a strategy
game, and the other class gives you a different set of
strategic and tactical tools and limitations.  This isn't the
eqivalent of switching to another slot machine, where
the same strategy of putting money in and pulling the lever
will yeild the same results as the first (albiet in a smaller
denomination coin, perhaps)  but one of going from poker
to baccarat, only in each case with far more variables.
