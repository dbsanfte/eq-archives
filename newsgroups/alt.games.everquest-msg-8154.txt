My main character is an Iksar so I never realized how tough it is for
non-Iksar to raise their faction with the Troopers/Crusaders, etc.  Is
raising faction with Iksar the most difficult of all the races?  I
seem to recall hearing that Barbarians are really super-hard, if not
impossible, to be non-KOS to you if you're evil; is that true?

The Iksar troopers/crusaders can be pretty hard even on other Iksars,
too, if they do something to piss them off.  I saw some poor Iksar SK
get killed by one of the guards (I'm guessing the SK tried to attack
the guard, I don't know, though), and right before the Trooper killed
him, he said something like "I really hate Shadow Knights like you!
Shadow Knights like you bring out the worst in me!"; then about three
times afterward when the SK went to try to retrieve his corpse, the
guards went and killed him again immediately, so this poor player had
like four corpses laying at the entrance!
