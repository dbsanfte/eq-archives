It is the "-" key, but the one on the numeric keypad of your
keyboard, not the one on the main letter/number keypad.
When you hit the right one, you'll get text in your chat
window that says something like "You have taken a screenshot".

If you still can't get it to work, you can go into the
Options/Keyboard settings and find the screenshot key and
remap it to something else more convenient.
