    They're milking the existing player base that wants to move servers to a
server that isn't crowded at their level of play. My server has four
elemental planes guilds or guild alliances on it, the most of any server.
And the elemental planes are really designed for two to three guilds to be
in them at once, tops. Most other servers have only one elemental planes
guild, and a small few have two. We're taking bets as to which of our
elemental guilds are going to move to the new server, where they'd likely
have the entire planes all to themselves.
