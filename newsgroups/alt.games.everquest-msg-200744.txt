The original poster was commenting on the solo power of his necro at
level 28 (just prior to his next spell circle). Your first post
contained the following line....

"My druid was soloing multiple reds at a time at that level."

I then responded to you asking how it was possible to solo multiple
reds at that level (28) with the available spells. The fact is that
you were not soling multiple reds (definately not 32-35 Zels) at level
28, as you asserted in your first post.

I don't refute your calculations. I refute your claim that you were
soloing multiple reds at level 28.

You finished your post by also mentioning that you had KEI. While this
may make it possible to solo multiple reds at 28, it is not the same
as doing so with only a "pair of focus effects".
