My point is that Druids in particular are the "catch all" class, but the one
specialty we DO
offer over and above the others - except Wizards who specialty is really
their blasting power - is Porting.

As I said take Clerics; sure, they can buff, and fight a bit, but what they
do best
and what they're sought for is healing. Now put in say a Hospital in every
zone
with NPC's that do Complete Heals for free, how would your Clerics feel?

Pretty pissed I think.
