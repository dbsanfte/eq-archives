1. If you see the message "Basher falls to the ground" the spell
failed.

2. If you DoT'd (Darkness line has a DoT component for instance) the
mob, it won't forget you. The next time the DoT pulses and causes
damage, the mob will remember you cast it and still agro.

3. Even when FD is successful (eg no "Falls to ground message") there
is still a change the mob will remember you if the mob is over level
32 (or 35? I can't remember)
