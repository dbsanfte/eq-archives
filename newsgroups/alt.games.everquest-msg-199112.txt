Martin,
Do you hold to the break point theory of stats ?
Where getting a stat above say 75 can have a large effect ?
If you do then starting stats can make some difference, at least to a 
young char.
The stuff I have been seeing about the effect of Charisma on spells 
makes me think that my enchanter could have used some more at creation :-(
