That's certainly a big part of it. Of course, sound was also bad with
the on-board audio I had, but not as bad as with the SBLive (I
changed, though, because the on-board audio made a humming noise ever
time I moved a window on my screen - some sort of RF problem).

No kidding! And, like I noted before, the card works flawlessly in
everything else on my system. So what's the deal with Verant?

Frankly, a fix has been overdue for a year now. Verant really needs to
hire some folks who seriously understand audio - there's really no
excuse for such an extreme problem to have existed this long.



There. That out to give the folks who think I'm a VAK a serious case
of temporary blindness.
