Eoneolla Halfarrow.   (my rangers name)

Eon = Time
Eolla = reference to Yamaha Eolla, Tournament recurve bow currently in
production, also old old japanese reference. IMHO The BEST tournament
recurve ever made. Hoyt can kiss my Arse.

Halfarrow = name of an Indian archer in a book I read when I was like in 5th
grade (cant remember the book name)

aka Archer of time
