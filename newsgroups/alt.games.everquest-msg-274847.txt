It is most cost effective, yes, to buy orange because you can use it with
good effect longer, but, all other parameters equal, the white stuff is best
for your current level. There's no reduction in the effects of white items
as there is with the yellow and orange ones.

Therefore, buy orange and keep it until it becomes blue. In other words,
don't "try to keep everything as close to orange as possible".
