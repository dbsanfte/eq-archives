I was in Crystal Caverns farming Velium (sigh. I dont want to *Speak*
about how dull this is. I hate it, I'm courteous to people who still
get xp and work things out with them, and I help people out - lets leave
it at that)  the other day and I went LD. Right as the room repopped. 5
miners and Foreman Rixact on me. Now, I had one miner selected. I was on
2 bubbles of health. Pretty certain I would have made it if I was there in
control with some judicious root seperation but LD and just standing around
for 2 minutes I was certain I was going to be dead.

I came back in the middle of a pile of corpses, unlooted, including Foreman
Rixact with his Frozen 2h sword, and a little health left (not much though ;) )

This is the first time I've ever heard of a LD chracters AI being smart
enough to actually change targets once the one being beat on was dead. I had
a damage shield (20 pts) up and a regen BP on, but even still... bizzare. Any
ideas?
