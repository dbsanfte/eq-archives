Generally, when I used to levitate across from the hidden valley, I would 
not touch down until I hit KC, could actually land on top of the KC wall.  
The giants also see invis, as do some of the spiders.  I never once had a 
problem with aggroing any mobs while I was floating across to KC.  After 
that, it's a short run to the FV tunnel.
