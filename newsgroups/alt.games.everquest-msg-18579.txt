Just today ... my lvl 2 gnome necro is running around the newbie garden
(next to the druid ring) in Steamfont with a skeleton holding a scythe in
tow .

lvl 31 Warrior: "Can you port me to Toxx?"
me: "Would if I could.  I'm a necro.  We can't port.  I can find your
corpse, though. <g>"
lvl 31 Warrior: "plz plz plz plz plz"
me: "Necros can't port!  And even if we could, I'm only lvl 2."
lvl 31 Warrior: "yes you can"
me: /ignore <Warrior>

I turn and continue hunting, then see .....

Soandso says out of character: 'Necros can't port, <Warrior>.'

<sigh>

More sad than frustrating, really.  I tend to run all of my characters
anonymous ...  wonder if turning off /anon would've helped in this case?
The pet should've been a dead giveaway, though ......

Que, sera sera, I suppose. <g>

Crash
