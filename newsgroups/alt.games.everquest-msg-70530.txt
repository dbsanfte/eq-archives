Using root for CC is very viable in some places, Velks not being one I'd
care to do though.  Our regular gang of 5 or 6 doesn't include either an
enchanter or bard so we've been using root tactics extensively and
actually do quite well with it.  Places like HS Seb and the like where
you aren't supposed to go without good CC are the best, but its high
tension fighting.  Velks on the other hand is pure tank CC, them spiders
laugh at root heh.

The key is that you don't take a mob if you have work to do and someone
else can take it, and once you do its yours.  When root breaks and it
comes to you it helps to have stood up at the yellow message and already
started casting before it gets to you in a spot you have decided you
want to root him next.  It isn't done willy nilly, its a controlled
tactic if you do it a lot.  You don't want your dress wearing folks
doing this, shaman and cleric preferred though druids work, they just
get hurt more.
