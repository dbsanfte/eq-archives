LOL Or the "fetch me from another zone, pick me up somewhere other than 
the ring cause I can't be bothered to find it, port me, then run 2 or 3 
zones to the nearest city to bind me and hey, since you're here and 
we've already established that you're a human (or elvish, or halfling 
/grin) doormat, I need buffs too" crowd. Going anon or ignoring people 
who send you tells isn't arrogance; it's self defense. Arrogance is 
assuming that players playing druids are there for your convenience and 
downtime reduction.

And, BTW, I seldom have SoW memmed. Wolf form, yes, but not SoW.
