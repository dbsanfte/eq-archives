Not only are they annoying, but they get HORRIBLY LOST AND STUCK ON PATHING.

There was a wizard and enchanter doing north wing in HS, and the stupidass
drake kept going back and forth from the zone in to the north wing door the
whole damn time.

There was a raid doing Zlandicar in DN, and I had about 4 of the flappy
bastards harassing me at the zone in.

Fortunately I got to take out some frustrations sunday in ToFS, 7th floor is
FILLED WITH THE BASTAGES!!!  So I killed them all.
