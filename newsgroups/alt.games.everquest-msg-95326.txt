My case exactly (except I'm only lvl 14). I've found this thread really
useful, it's hopefully prevented me from making a whole load of mistakes.
I'm cringing at the potential damage I could cause! I would hope that if I
was screwing up, someone would tell me what I was doing wrong and how I
should behave. Is there any kind of "Idiot's Guide" that covers these sort
of group tactics? I'm now wondering what other potential cock-ups are there
to be made. :-)

Thanks for the enlightenment folks!
