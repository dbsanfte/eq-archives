Disagreeing that druids need to be improved does not make anyone a
"druid basher."  I have nothing at all against druids.  I played one
to the high forties, when I began to see the writing on the wall and
opted to play other classes.

There has to be a downside to every class, so let me ask you what you
propose the downside to a druid should be if the class were given some
raid-specific ability making it very useful for raids?  Not being the
best at anything isn't a very good downside when you can do
practically everything and are second-best at most of those things.

Hughes' assertion to the contrary, you have only to look on your
server to see how many high-end druids there are.  It's probably the
second most popular class after warrior.  I very much doubt *all* of
those druids are playing the class because they love it for
role-playing reasons.  So hmmm, let's see here, what other reason
could there possibly be?

And if we make druids more useful on raids, how then do we respond to
the warrior or the cleric who wishes he could solo better?
