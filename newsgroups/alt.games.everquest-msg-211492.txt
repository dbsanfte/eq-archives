All governments legislate morality in one way or another, this is part of 
how social order is preserved.

Who cares if all religions do not condone it?  That has nothing to do 
with whether or not it should be made into a legal issue, or, for that 
matter, whether or not such behavior should be considered moral.

In this day and age, the primary purpose of intercourse is enjoyment, 
regardless of who it is you are having said intercourse with.  Even most 
married couples do not have sex with the primary purpose of precreating, 
certainly not here in the US.

I refuse to even speculate as to why a person is homosexual, I don't see 
that it matters really.  If you take a look at the animal kingdom in 
general, you will find that homosexual behavior is not limited to people.

Who am I, or anyone else, to say what a person should or should not do in 
private, so long as noone is harming anyone else involuntarily.

So, basically, you don't want legislation against it, but you want all of 
society to condemn people who have behaviors that are not up to your 
"universal" moral standards?
