No, the reason Bizbee has me killfiled is that when he
challenged me to provide evidence that he sometimes flames
the undeserving, I actually posted it.  He then instantly
killfiled me.

The other reason is that he can certainly dish out the
flames, but he's absolutely unable to accept any
criticisms himself, so he hides behind his killfile
whenever anyone dares to do so more than once or twice.
He's a classic example of the cowardly bully.

Ever notice that whenever he accuses me of being
a "fucking pinhead", he never actually explains
the accusation or provides any examples?

On the other hand, whenever I claim that Bizbee
is missing the point, I explain exactly *what*
point he is misunderstanding, and how he is
missing it, in detail.


> he just doesn't get it. Ever.

I don't mind Bizbee being this dogmatically ridiculous --
I've come to expect it.

But I'm starting to get pretty weary of the fact that
every time Bizbee launches another "Dan is worthless",
"Dan is a fucking idiot", "Dan has never ever 'gotten it'"
screech, no one ever feels an urge to stand up for me
and point out that I do, actually, make worthwhile
contributions to this newsgroup and am not in
fact completely clueless.

I can ignore a spoiled child repeatedly calling me a poo-poo
head.  That's what spoiled children do, they can't help it.

But when the adults in the area never bother to tell
the child he's out of line, or let the recipient know
that they disagree with the child's declaration,
one can start to feel pretty damned unappreciated.

If y'all actually agree with Bizbee, as your
silence seems to indicate, just come out and say so
and I'll get the hell out of this newsgroup.  I can
take a hint.

Listen!  It's the sound of a mind slamming shut!

This is also yet another marvelous example of Bizbee,
ironically enough, not "getting it".  What he's not
getting, as is too frequently the case, is the
issue of what I am, and am not, actually talking
about.

The fact is that my point about the proposed
"/faint" emote has nothing to do with any argument
for or against people practicing FD (or other "noisy")
skills in the "middle of a crowd".

Did I ever say that someone "needs" to practice "incessantly"
in the "middle of a crowd"?  Why no, I didn't.

So why is Bizbee suddenly snottily saying that he'd
"like to hear" me "explain to us all" why someone
would "need" to do so, when I never said anything of
the kind?  For the usual reasons, of course:
Because Bizbee has poor reading comprehension, and because
he's more of a "fucking idiot" than those whom he
accuses of being such.

For the *third time*, here's my point in such
simple terms that even Bizbee should be able
to grasp it for a change (or maybe not, he can
be remarkably slow at times):

1.  People who FD a lot now do so because the
    game gives them an incentive to do so:
    If they want to have a high FD skill the
    next time they *need* it to survive an
    encounter with a mob, they'd best do it
    a lot outside of combat to practice the
    skill up.

2.  Contrary to Bizbee's bone-headed "I'd
    like to hear" rant above, this is entirely
    apart from the issue of whether it would
    be more polite for them to do so apart
    from other people whom it might annoy.
    I never made any comment about that one
    way or the other.

3.  Non-FD'ing classes who might get the
    proposed "/faint" animated emote would
    not have this game-induced incentive
    to do it over and over again, and thus
    would be less motivated to do so
    than an actual FD class is now.

4.  It could be used specifically to annoy,
    or for the user's personal amusement
    without realizing that it might be
    annoying to others.  But the same
    people can (and do) already use the
    other several dozen animated (and
    non-animated) emotes in the game
    that way; having just one more
    added to their arsenal won't change
    a thing, especially after the
    novelty value of a new one wears
    off after a few days.

5.  Hell, at the very least it'll add
    a bit more variety to their acts,
    which might help relieve the monotony
    of non-stop "dances with so-and-so"
    emotes.

Short form:  People won't (ab)use the
a "/faint" emote as often as people (ab)use
their FD skill, because they're not motivated
by the game to practice the hell out of it.

Now, was that so hard to understand?  Oops,
I forgot who I was dealing with.
