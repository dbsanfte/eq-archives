Well, it would be nicer if we could dig for oil without fucking up the 
environment and depleting a limited resource. :)  I agree about the 
nuclear power, personally.  Although solar and/or wind and possibly 
hydroelectric would be infinitely better than either of those choices.  
And possibly that one where you put a thermocouple near the base of a 
volcano...

I see my humor was lost on you, till the end there. :)  Yes, I was talking 
about a bloody mary.  But also, if we could have an electric or alternate 
non-petroleum engine that had the same degree of fashionable chic as a V8, 
life would be improved. :)
