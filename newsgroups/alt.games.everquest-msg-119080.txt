No, because there's at least some sensible backing to the overall
Christian philosophy. The life choices preached do improve society in
general. It's the rabid zealots that are the problem. The "rabid
humanitarian" vegitarians are a certain sect, just as the reorganized
LDS are a certain sect of Christians. I can disagree with one sect and
their methods and lifestyles without disagreeing with the entire
religion.
