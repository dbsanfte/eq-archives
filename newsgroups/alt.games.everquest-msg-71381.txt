As somebody who almost exclusively (almost) plays melee characters,
HOLY SHIT!

It's about freaking time!

I'm not even upset about "only in starting cities," either.  If I really
need a bind in Kunark, I'll wait until a guildee is porting there anyway,
and I don't go to Velious unless I definately have something to do,
so getting a guildee to bind isn't much of a problem, either.  What's
always horrible is getting ready to go to EC and stepping off the boat
at 3 AM CST and there being nobody in Freeport but 3 level 2 monks
just starting out :-).
