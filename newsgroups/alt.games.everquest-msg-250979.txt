Perhaps he's planning ahead for the DX10 patch.   You know it's 
inevitable.

Perhaps he does other stuff with the machine besides EQ.

In either case, I'm interested too.  Been thinking of upgrading to an 
AMD64 so I can get a motherboard with this 'cool and quiet technology' 
I've been hearing about.  So I can keep the trader up all night and not 
listen to a @#$! noisy fan.

Of course, I may be better served to upgrade the cat to a hairless model 
so the fan wouldn't get plugged up so fast....
