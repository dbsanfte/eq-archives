I tried this route earlier today and was stranded on Sister's Isle
because there was no translocator npc there.  I had presumed, when
I left FP, that there would be a guy on the Sister's dock to send
me on my way.  I looked all around the island for him, thinking
that perhaps he had chased some KOS person away from the dock, but
I never found him.  Eventually the boat came along and I completed
the trip to BB in the usual fashion.  Why didn't Verant make these
npcs with neutral faction?  Seems a simple enough idea.  :-(
