There's a discussion of this on the Paladins of Norrath forum.

The general consensus is that this "side-effect" of the graveyards
was intentional, in order to add a new sort of strategy requirement
to raiding.

Anything that changes the same-ol-same-ol is probably a good thing
in itself, a game this old needs some novelty to keep things
interesting.  And the PoP expansion has a *lot* of novelty, which
is nice.  The developers are getting creative.

Plus, and here's the interesting part, it means that if your
group/raid can't keep up a lively pace and rez effectively
on the run, it'll quickly dwindle down to too few people to
continue.  Thanks for playing the Plane of X, you'll have to
start over from the beginning, making room for the groups/raids
that are more able to keep up with the zone content.

And while it doesn't eliminate it, it certainly puts some
limitations on the old "camp a Cleric" technique of trivializing
some otherwise dangerous spots.  You can still camp a Cleric,
but when he returns half the party's corpses may be back at the
zone-in already...

Finally, it puts a major crimp in some of the exploits that
have been used for years wherein people would purposely leave
a corpse somewhere (or have one dragged across the zone by
a non-KoS PC), to be rezzed later in order to make certain
things easier than they were meant to be.
