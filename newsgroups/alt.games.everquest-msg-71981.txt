I didn't say RD puller.  Yes, I've seen it done.  No, I don't want the necro
in my group pulling.  :)

Paladin for DA to survive the HTs long enough to get DT'ed (cleric works
too).  Druid because the main place for a DT-eater is Fear and you always
have plenty to spare (ranger also qualifies).  I'd never send a bard to eat
a DT, but then my guild has always been historically bard-light.

>> CR (monk/rogue)

Surprising good in some instances.  Monk and rogue are still the old
standbys, though, as a monk will actually live through the first failed
feign.

>Cleric/Bard

Bard maybe.  I've seen bards get eaten for no discernible reason other than
they were bards.  A good cleric isn't all that much of a taunt.  Even the
best enchanters and rangers taunt like it's going out of style.

Should have added "Fear Kiter" for ranger/necro/sk.  And yeah, bard should
be in with the kiters.

Since you didn't actually disagree with any of my categories, I must not be
very bad at it either.  You should go try DAoC (what is this "dig" supposed
to mean anyway?).
