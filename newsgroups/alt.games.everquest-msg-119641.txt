Hello, Some friends and I have started playing EQ again after a long
layoff.
We have started a little band of Dark Elfs. All untwinked, no PL
allowed.
We have a Cleric, Wizard, Shadow Knight and a Necro (me).
We think this is a fairly balanced group. We hope to pick up a
chanter, but that is still up in the air.

Any advice for this team? One weak spot, the cleric has never played
EQ or any other RPG. However, since we are all (now) level 4 he seems
to be catching on.

If we were to add another char, what should it be?

As a Necro, what should my role be in a group?
(I am doing research on this, I was just looking for hints)


Thanks
Rodjk
