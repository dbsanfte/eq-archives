No.  Your freedom is not eroded.  As a consumer, I have the right to ask
that offensive matter is not carried on networks that I pay to support.  If
the corporation decides to carry the offensive material, I have the right to
move to a new provider.  The content is still available on the net with out
being condoned by my provider.  Your freedom would not be infringed (you may
have to work a little more for it) and I am appeased as a consumer,

No one "grants" freedoms, we sieze them and hold them jealously as a
society.  When the government tries to revoke them, the outcry can be, and
should be, deafening.  When corporations self censor, it is capitalism at
work.  The corportation is doing what it can to try to keep as many
customers as possible.
