You have to "zone" between Kalimdor and the eastern continents, and you 
"zone" into instances and also the tram between stormwind and ironforge. 
Apart from that its all continuous. Tedrassil is just part of the kalimdor 
system, and you could swim across if it wanst for fatigue.

You can swim around the whole continent if you so choose. The regions within 
the continents are purely for content, the engine doesnt recognize them as 
zones.
