>OMG u consider that a test of someone that plays the game?  hahaha HAHAHA

Since you failed to answer even one of them, I'll have to assume that it is
a quite reasonable test for you. If you like, I can come up with hard
stuff, but we both know that you wouldn't be able to answer a single one.

Just go away.

>u really do think im 12 dontcha!  ;)

Based on your apparent intelligence and typing skills, I'd put you at 7.

>u should really reconsider ur overuse of the word moron... as an "insult" it
>comes across rather flat... especially for the 20th time  =]

Moron.
