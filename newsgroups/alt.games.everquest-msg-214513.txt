I think they should have simultaneously boosted their DPS

I love being grouped with a bard, there haste, mana / health regen, mez,
charm, slows are all good, as well as adding melee damage AND being one of
the best pulling classes in alot of zones.

Monks I would probably (and maybe not unfairly), as one of the least useful
classes, rogue > monk for dps, and all a monk is is dps, so its kinda sad.
Sure they can FD, but I have yet to see this put to good use other than to
avoid aggro in 57 levels (+4 alts). This may be due to the lack of monks at
the moment (or apparent lack anyway).

Bards and infinintley more desirable (to me), than monks are, at the moment.

And at least a warrior can tank / offtank if needed, and a druid can bring
a fair amount to a group, without being completely overshadowed by other
classes (nice dots on high hp mobs, can add nice damage with charmed pets
(situational), reasonable nukes and good heals and buffs at higher levels).

Monks need some kind of boost for definite, almost as much as warriors need
better aggro control.
