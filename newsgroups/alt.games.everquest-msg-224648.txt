They are. I will paste the terms of the offer below, but the part to take
note is that "Your everquest account must be in good standing order
throughout the special  phase EverQuest II beta". In other words, if your
not paying your regular monthly fee then no soup for you. I would be really
suprised if there was anything more than a week or two between the
Legends/Lords/RegularSubscriber phases to, ie, they are using the very last
"stress test phase" where most MMRPGs go open beta as a carrot to be divided
up and rationed out to us donkeys.
Terms:
-Offer open to residents of US and Canada only
-Your EverQuest account must be in good standing when you register Lords of
EverQuest
-Your EverQuest account must be in good standing throughout the special
phase of the
EverQuest II beta
-You must sign and adhere to all of the terms of the EverQuest II Beta
Agreement
-You must download the EverQuest II client when SOE makes it available; if
you cannot and need
to order disc(s), you will be responsible for all applicable shipping and
handling charges
-The "special phase" of the EverQuest II beta, for purposes of this offer,
will be a beta phase that
will be after the phase of beta for "Legends" subscribers, but will be prior
to any "public" beta
phase
- One subscription extension and beta invitation per valid EverQuest account
