So, looky, looky.... the whiners get their cheese.
:-)
Read that last paragraph carefully folks. You all wanted class action
lawsuits to get back your four dollars and fourteen cents for not being
able to use your Win 95 based POS computer since Dec. 4th, and now
you've got it. But read that last paragraph one more time. A little
parting shot for the whiners from VI. Should you actually decide later
on to go out and spend the 10 bucks on upgrading to Win 98, and then
come back, your uber characters will be *gone*. Time to start over.

I wonder how many people (aside from a handful that only just purchased
the game for the very first time this month and found out it wouldn't
run on their Win 95 machine) are actually going to take Sony up on this
offer? No way to find out, I'm sure, but even for all the whining,
bitching, and moaning, when the reality of that "... your account and
characters will be permanently removed from EverQuest" statement sinks
in, I'm betting there won't be more than a dozen people that actually do
it.
