I created a Halfling ranger today to mess around with, and to eventually 2
box with my chanter.  What is some decent armor I can buy/quest for him?  I
do not wish to spend too much since it is like my 10th alt =P  Also which
weapon should I get?  I currently have a 1 HB and 2 HS but with slow delays,
but ok to work on those skills.

TIA, Danny
