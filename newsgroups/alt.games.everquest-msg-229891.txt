And, therefore, I stand corrected. I'm big enough to admit that.

Yeah, I guess you have.  I never traveled around the world killing people 
in foriegn lands, never watched burned bodies that are still smoking, 
never feared for my life in earnest, never had the chance to see someone 
wounded in combat, never been on jury duty on a case involving damn-near 
rape of an 11 year old girl, never been sued for someone else breaching  
a contract, never worked, and never had any friends.  Nope, never spent 
much time in the real world, not me.  

My point, however, was that language - both that you "approve" of and 
that you don't, is real world communication.  (And, the question was 
rhetorical, but that is a moot point now.)

And I know I snipped alot, but it wasn't anything important to my reply, 
so it went bye bye.

<lots of snipping here>

COOL!  I've been ignored!
