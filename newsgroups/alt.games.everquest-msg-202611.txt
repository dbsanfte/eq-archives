Just a thought: when you installed RoK, did it get installed in the same
directory as your base Everquest?  I've read of instances where people
installed EQ in E:\Program Files\EverQuest, and then had the expansion
installed in C:\Program Files\Everquest.  Check to make sure that's not the
case.

It could also be that every single zone has been patched since RoK was
released, and you really are running into a download limit.  I'd contact
Tech Support and explain your situation; I'm sure there's a workaround.
