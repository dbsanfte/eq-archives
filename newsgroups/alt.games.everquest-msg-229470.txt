Thanks all, this helps... I was just letting charmed pet kill as I
gained mana back for my next quad. Still the exp was not bad for
downtime exp. (Always keep a 30% mana buffer, try to never go below it
unless needed). In the future, I think slapping a Swarming Death on
mob will be my approach in PoN. At least from what I have read, that
sounds like a good stratagy. Thanks, this does help me a bunch!

BtW - Ding 55 Whoot!

(Aww, what a nice little bear. "Pets Gaber" Ok boy, attack this that
mob and take that death touch for me. Good boy! Hehe... Wow, who said
he doesn't have a use.
