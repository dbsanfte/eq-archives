I have a 56 Druid on FV with zero AA XP.  My plan was to get to 60 and then
work on AA.  To be honest, I did not see anything in AA that looked like it
would give me more bang-for-the-buck then leveling would.  Now, with PoP
soon to be released, I am having second thoughts - I certainly don't want to
wait until 70 to work on AA, LOL.

What to do, what to do?  Suggestions and advice are cordially invited.
