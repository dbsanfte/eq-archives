That film was worse than the last two, so it must get a B. I never had my
own style, I tended to copycat others. My ony real gift in filmmaking was
probably editing and visual sense and I thought I had a good eye for talent.
The people who made these films lived happy idyllic lifes with no problems,
a bunch of spoiled punks who don't know that pain and extroverted depression
is needed to create art. I may have designed a better world, but not perfect
because there is no pain which is needed to be a true artist. I don't know
what school we all went to, probably San Francisco? This just isn't what I
wanted to see, the movie I want to see is still down there and I want to see
it, right now. And if that one sucks then it is a perfect world filled with
overeducated pansy ass muther fuckers who play Everquest and drink beer and
have sex with their genius supermodel girlfriends all day and let computers
and robots do all their work, that is not a world that I could possibly
endorse or live in, I'm sorry. I need to go to my job at the factory on
Monday so I can make 12.60 an hour and save up for a Realdoll.
