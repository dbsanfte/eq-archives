Funny how this is completely opposite to your original post.

You had no reason to lie in your original post.

But now that it's been picked apart and your actions, described by you,
make look like a whining child, you're back to change your story and
insist you actually did all the things people have said you should have
done.

Gee I wonder which version is real?

Funny how this never made it into your original post or any of your
subsequent posts in this thread.

In fact the only mention at all of you saying anything at all to do with
harassment was in response to Dark Tyger;

DT:  KSing in itself isn't against the rules in CoH, however, harassment
is.

YOU: I did send an email after terminating my account, explaining the
whole episode in detail. They answered that because I had terminated my
account, they were marking the petition as having been resolved.
