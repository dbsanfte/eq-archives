>outrun the mobs to the bridge and zone into Iceclad

Yes I tested out that route several times to get familiar with the escape.
But it is a risky get away move do to roaming KOS mobs in between.  I do
like to look around a zone before I go in there with gunz brazin.

It was no fun to fall in to the Pit Trap in Black Burrow gunz brazin.  I was
young Pally than.  Lost everything I had on me.

>I would suggest you just head back to Crushbone, you are pretty safe there.

Ya been there done that, for the Gatorsmash Maul Quest at lvl 28.  I though
Dvinn would fall to peaces with few hits.  He is in low 20s you know.
Wrong.  If I was screwing around he could have killed me instead!  Around
that time it became clear to me that by grouping often my shammy was getting
too dependent on others.  Only certain skills developed.  Soloing became
harder and harder.  So I have been soloing for some time now to get my other
skills up.

You know, the very first time I zoned in to CB with my young Pally, Dvinn
was standing right in front of me.  He gave me two quick punches and my
health was down to 10%!  I almost died that day.
