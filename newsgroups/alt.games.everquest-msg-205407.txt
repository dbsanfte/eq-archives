I looked at a bunch of various haste spells/songs, via Lucy, and found
that the Slot for what Lucy displays as "Increase Attack Speed ##%"
varies quite a bit, and we already know that even when those spells
stack only the higher haste effect applies.  I then looked at the two
Xx Vah Shir Bard Songs and their effects were listed as "Increase
Haste v3 ##", presumably because they are keyed differently in the
spdat.  Sadly, the effect for Spirit Quickening is listed as "Increase
Attack Speed 20%" _not_ "Increase Haste v3 20%".

Combining empirical data reported elsewhere about haste stacking
with my couple minutes of second-hand research suggests that the
the slot used for an effect only affects spell stacking while
effect stacking is handled internally by the game engine.

[Somewhat OT:  while I was hunting around I came across the spell
Battle Cry of Regrua (usable by no class) which does 3k HP while
granting the victim the apparent benefit of a +20% movement
increase.  I say apparent, because the movement increase is in
slot 2, which is where (for instance) SoW has it's increase, so
that in effect this is a very mild snare as I assume that anybody
fighting a mob that can proc/cast an unresistible 3k DD will long
since have taken the Move 3 AA, and possibly a movement buff as
well if outdoors (would this prevent using JBoots clicky?).  This
Regrua must be a real sweetheart.]
