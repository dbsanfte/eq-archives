Idle threat, still counts. Can't yell fire in a crowded theater or say you
have a bomb when boarding a plane, even if you don't have one.

On a funnier note. "Imahuntingfish" was making a general pest of himself on
RZ and got petitioned for stupid name violation.

I wish I could remember the GMs name, but they changed it to something like
"Irmahog". Apparrently some GMs have a real sense of humor about this stuff.
This guy spent about 20 minutes complaining in /shout about how much he
hated his new name which was like throwing blood in shark infested waters
when I am around. I'm not saying I lied to get his goat, I was RP'ing, yeah,
that's the ticket.

Irmahog; "wtf! i hate my nu name!"
me; "What's wrong with being named Irma?"
me; "Irma is a fine name. My grandmother was named Irma!"
... etcetera

It was one of the best laughs I have had in game.
