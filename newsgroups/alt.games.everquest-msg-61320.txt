Wow!  Some people actually *do* learn languages!

Hehe...but seriously, thank you for the offer, but I'm on the Luclin server.

And if anybody out there is on the Luclin server and wants to trade
languages my main character is Deaana, she's a druid and can port herself
(only herself right now) anywhere she needs to go to meet you and exchange
languages.

Blessings,
Cousin Raven
