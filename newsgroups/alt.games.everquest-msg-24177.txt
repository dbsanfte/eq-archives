All hafling druids follow Karana (we have no choice.) Wood elf and human druids
have the option of following Karana, but most follow Tunare instead (better items
for Tunare worshippers, I'm afraid) Human paladins have the option of following
Karana, but most end up following one of the other deities such as Rodcet Nife (in
Qeynos) or one of the Marr twins (in Freeport.)
