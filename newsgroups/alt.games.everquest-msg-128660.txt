With the Needlites (ignore the mutants, not worth it), run in to the room
invis.  Turn left immediately and make for the corner.  You can start
prepping there and bring up your pet.  There are seven spawn points in the
room.  From your camp site, working along the wall to your left (facing the
room) there are 3 Needlites. One in the middle, one in the far corner, one
in the middle of the wall (ahead and slight right), and one hidden in the
drop just as you enter the room.  Only the one in the middle and the far
corner are linked, so they can all be single pulled.

Actual spell lineup is:
Allure
FD
Banshee Aura/Shielding/Focus Death
Screaming Terror
Tap (I forget the name)
Leach
Blast of Poison
Darkness

The Needlites are on a 20 minute timer.  Darkness pull one with with all
shields up and pet buffed (don't worry about pet armor, they almost never
attack pet).  They hit fast (10 or 11 delay) but relatively light (3 to 18
dmg).  You may be able to BoP one on the way in (if you pull from the far
side of the room), tap, tap, tap (or BoP if no real damage) last Leach.
They should try to run out to the hall, but with darkness, they won't get
there (make ure darkness sticks).  Med for the next one.   Draw the pair
last because you may get the far wall spawn with a bad pull.  To pull the
pair, ST one of them and the other will come to you.  Darkness, tap,
BoP/tap, rinse, repeat.  The drop wings and legs which sell for 2plus plat
each.  I had 1-2 stacks of each for each level.

The middle spawn will sometimes be the Queen (about every 3rd or 4th room
pop).  She drops a Giant Needlite Wing (back armor) or the uncommon (1/3)
Needlite Stinger (7/24 [?]) piercer with a 2 pt disease add'l damage).  The
Queen hits slower (about 25) and harder (up to 33).  You can use the same
tactics with her, but she will sometimes make it out into the hall.

Watch out when looting the corpses.  If the dropped near the wormspore on
the cieling, con the corpse, if it has 7 minutes to go, loot it, if 30 secs
or less, ignore it.  Why?  the damn wormspore will suck you dry if not
careful.  They seem to hit more often if you are damaged.  If they do
attack, just get back to the corner and FD.

Good Hunting (I walked out with 4 Giant Wings, 2 Stingers and about 7 total
stacks of wings/legs) as well as 4 levels (24-28).  Moved to SolA and am
trying to work there, but being an Erudite, I need to get shrink potions
(luckily, my Shaman makes them for me).
