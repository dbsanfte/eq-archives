Every so often I do stroll through Playerauctions to get an idea of the plat
value of items.  Today I looked at a couple of servers and saw very, very
few bids.  For example, I saw a total of 8 items bid upon on the Seventh
Hammer server, and only 8 had bids attached to them.  Of those, 1 was an
account, 4 were for plat, the rest were items (one Fungi tunic and a couple
of low-end items cheap).  Does this mean that the bazaar has put an end to
the "he who has the most money is uber" players?  Please say it's so.
