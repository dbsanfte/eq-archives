I've been a raid shaman, monk and necro now. Without a shadow
of a doubt being "3rd shaman" on the average raid is one of the
most dull experiences there is.

I've heard that some PoP encounters need multiple slowers, and
the AoE's and Quiscience at least give shaman something to do,
but my shaman never got close to that level.

Also shaman group buffs come very late, which is annoying. Later
shaman mana regen means that a single shaman can realistically
buff a raid, although two would be more reasonable. Then there's
also the possibility of MGB to speed things along, but none of
our shaman have bothered.

AFAIK cripple has a minor role when the mob has a proc. Other than
that it's just a "what the hell" debuff. Note that the enchanters
have cripple as well, not to mention a quite decent slow.

The shaman DoT's are actually plenty powerful. However they tend
to have immense agro and resist problems. So in theory shaman can
pump out solid DPS but in practice they are restricted from doing
so. The JBB quickly fades in raids, the doggy swarm AA is really
fun to watch but not terribly powerful.

Sounds about right. Usefull, but not the most satisfying job i've
seen. There's also curing curses and DoT's on your group. And the
uber shaman i've seen seem to sling quiscience around with a gay
abandon.

Assuming the raid has two shaman it would be a lot better if you
were a cleric and a little bit better if you were a druid for 
far superior DD and superior healing. Not to mention superior
buffing, Bot9 beats the pants off Fot7 in value.
