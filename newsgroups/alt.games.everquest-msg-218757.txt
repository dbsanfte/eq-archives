Overall, in my experience, druids are better than shaman at healing, and 
not as good as clerics.  This is strictly from a healing perspective.  If 
the group has room for one person, and needs both a slower and a healer, 
then, sure, the shaman is the obvious choice, but, if they have a slower, 
and need just a healer, the druid is the better choice.
