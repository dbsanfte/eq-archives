Steel laced aged snake whip is now required level 60,
glad I could sell mine 5 minutes before the servers were
going down for patch for 2.5k.
The buyer and the Tailor folks will not be glad as me,nice
way to piss your customers off Sony.  *shakes head*
And it was really necessary to tag a required level 25 on
a 22/7 weapon(Aged etched scale snake whip)?Oh my
at level 24 this weapon would be much too powerful,making
you godly,rofl.
And no ,I dont have a high level tailor.  :)

While we are at it,another stealthy nerf I really like is the now 
ultra low drop rate of gems and jewelry from Wisps in JPF.
2 years ago,I remember,every 5th or 6th wisp dropped a gem
like a emerald,golden amulet or black pearl,while now, doing 
the whole level 50 meleeing wisps(with a Ranger in JPF!,please
no comments on this :)),I got exactly 1 golden amulet.

Maybe the time spent on this crap would have been better
invested in fixing  the graphic engine,add some higher level 
stuff to Ldon or to free the hoppers in Mons Letalis.  :)

Thats all so sad,EQ has a lot of good points,but with an attitude
like this to the players they will loose more and more customers.
All these little things add up and make it easier to leave the game,
for me it means I will surely not play EQ2 as next MMORPG,when 
I have an alternative now.I dont know how Blizzard treats its 
players but the logical choice now is to give them a chance before
playing another SOE game.
