Sounds like you did something wrong.  It does take forever but no increase
in 3 hours?  Sometimes it takes me as much as 10-15 mins between increases
but they DO happen...at least, pre-SoL.  I don't know about after...you
might /bug it.

But yeah, chances are you're gonna have to do more unattended concerts...you
simply don't use those skills often enough for them to go up on their own.
Look at the bright side...I actually have to be at the desk for a couple
hours to increase the conjuration skill for my wizard. :p  When I worked my
bard I was THRILLED that I could go afk. :)
