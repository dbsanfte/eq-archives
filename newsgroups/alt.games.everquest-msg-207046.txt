This gets better as you level. Clarity will certainly help. Even so, I
used Augmentation all through my 30s and no one ever complained. At
53, you get Aanya's Quickening which lasts 24min instead of 16min.
That makes a huge difference.

I only slow when there is no Shaman in the group. Even then, only the
tougher mobs get slowed. If they're gonna be dead in less than two
minutes, it hardly seems to matter. I only use the lull line for
travel.

God, I really *LOVE* AoE mez. What a group saver. Also a great train
stopper. This one really makes you feel like an Enchanter.

Happens to the best of us. Be sure to keep a MR buff up. Will help
resist when you "accidently" find yourself in the AoE.

I almost never cast any damage dealing spells. Damage is someone elses
job :)
Stat debuffs seem almost useless. I haven't used one in ages. I'll
tash tough or named mobs when they come up, or mez / tash / charm, but
other than that, tash does not have a permenant slot in my spell gems.

I never used Berserker Strength. Never gave it much thought till after
50. By then, I had Berserker Spirit. I have that one up constantly
now. 200hp damage absorber - I almost never need heals.

In tank light groups, Berserker Spirit, root mob, step in to get
whacked (damage is absorbed) and pet takes over. And keep that pet
hasted. They may not be much on AC or HP, but they put out an
impressive amount of damage when hasted. Even so, I rarely have a pet.
I like to have the option to charm instead (remember, on big pulls,
charm is better than mez for CC. Can be a group saver.) But if there
are no tanks in the group, Jojobar comes out.
