it's never happened to me before, but it did happen to a guild member last
night.  he fell from the wizard spires in Gfay.  i didn't even know you
could climb up those things...anyways, he was apparently waiting to get
ported so he decided it would be a good idea to climb one of the spires.  he
fell off and suffered 20k damage.  he's a high level cleric, though, so he
just rezzed himself.
