    You shouldn't. Massive mudflation is bad.

    Really? I look at the items from Time and they excite me a lot. And I'm
an elemental cleric with 4400 HPs unbuffed and special mods coming out the
wazoo.

    It's also an incorrect assessment. You're saying that upgrading between
expansions should be huge. We're talking about items **in the same
expansion**. And if your theory was applied as all the droolers at FoH's
site want done, by the end of the expansion players would be obscenely
powerful beyond recognition. Elemental players are already silly powerful -
we kill Creator in Ssra, and Klandicar and Sontalak in WWastes with a single
group, for example. The more "silly powerful" you make characters, the more
previous expansions get trivialized and the more people start slumming and
taking content away from people further down the food chain. Really. Those
mobs drop some nice, valuable items, and when someone says "It'll only take
a few people and not a lot of time" it becomes very enticing.

> Velious was a cool expansion, and so was Luclin

    Yet, from top of Velious to top of Luclin the top drops only increased
HPs/MANA by 25%. You're upset that the same stats are increased by 10%
**between the fifth and sixth stages of the final zone alone**. Between
top-end Luclin and top-end PoP those stats are going up by over 60%, and
instead of one useful focus the items have **three**. Yeah, shitty stuff,
/boggle.

    Read above. Do you not have a high-level character? Have you seen some
of the silly things characters can do nowadays? I'm a cleric, and I can solo
the first two mushrooms in The Deep. At the same time. With melee. They hit
for over 200 damage. At the end, I'm at over 80% mana, and only because I
have to nuke runners.

    25%? What game are you playing? I'm going to get 1 K HPs unbuffed and
360 AC (currently 1441 unbuffed) just by upgrading from elemental-level loot
to Time loot, not being a lootwhore about it. THAT is 25%. I'll be at about
5300 HPs unbuffed then. A well-geared casual cleric (with Skyshrine armour,
and Bazaar-buyable items) would be doing well to hit 2600 HPs, half that
total. I don't think it was Luclin that was responsible for most of that
difference.... Here's my Magelo profile, BTW, with the "I can dream" alt
