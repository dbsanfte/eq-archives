What is up with you people?  Three patches in three days?  And all at 6am
Eastern?  If you have to do it, stagger them at different times!  How about
one at 6pm so the rest of the world knows what we early people go through?
I paid to play this game to relax not get POed because you wanted to
inconveince the morning people rather than upset the evening players that
have never had to put up with this!  Share your lack of being able to "Do
Things Right The First Time" with the rest of the world and give us morning
players a break!!!!!!!!!!!

Sorry to all about the rant but I just had to let it out and my dog is tired
of hearing it.
