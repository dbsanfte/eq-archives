My girlfriend who used to play had an interesting way of 'begging'. Being a
woman she had that natural inclination of striking up a conversation with..oh
just about anyone as in:
her "Is that another person there?"
me "yep"
her "Im going to talk with them"
me "Why? you dont know them"
her "So, this game isnt just about killing things"
So she would proceed to strike up conversations with anyone who crossed her
path, inviting them to fish with her or whatever. Anyway, after a while she
would just go up to the ones in expensive looking gear and give them the "Your
gear looks amazing! you look fantastic, i hope one day i can afford stuff like
that, alas im just a poor paladin etc" line of bullshit.
She ended up with a full set of banded, kite shield and fine steel long sword
along with other assorted nicknacks and plat. Somehow i dont think this tactic
would have been quite as succesfull if her character was male.
