I wasn't around for the first 6 months of EQLive, but from what I hear, it 
had even less content that EQ2 does now. EQ2 doesn't strike me as lacking 
in content, though those who have already hit max level have understandably 
run out of stuff to do in many cases. That's to be expected though, I'd 
say.
