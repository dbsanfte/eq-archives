Recycle time of Forage skill is 1m30sec,so how many fruits
and vegetables do you get per hour?
And what about the time it takes to buy all the other components?

I dont say you cant make plat with MTPs,only that there
are better ways,as mentioned before,have a look at
Shadeling silk.

And dont take me wrong,I like trade skilling,all my mains
have most tradeskills near 200 or one above,just for fun.

But the money lies in the ingredients,not in the endproduct.
Reason is there are some quests,for which you need
several high trade skills,and strangely enough MTPs
are a skill up item,so the market is flooded with them.
