That included significant time swinging at air ("your target is too far
away"), the results of the parse posted by K64 do not match the log (at
least not the whole log, 41 hits goes less than half-way thru it).
So I'm not ready to just accept his numbers as they are.  But to answer
your question, I believe my DPS is 22ish against low blue-con mobs
(solo, self-haste only, using my 2-hander to max damage output), which
is tough to compare to a fight against a yellow con mob (I miss a lot
more against higher cons and do smaller hits).  I'll try to remember to
parse some log data when I get home, including Lance's log, you've got
me interested now.

Just keep in mind that Lance's most recent log differs a lot from the
first posted result of over 40 DPS, regardless of any "nerf".  Lance
fought a yellow-con mob, not a low blue, and the 40 DPS included the
effects of another spell (Mark of Karn?  not very well versed in high
level cleric spells).
