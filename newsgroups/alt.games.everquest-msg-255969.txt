Lots of ways.  Maybe you were using one of the alternate camera
views.  Maybe you had them targeted and could see the target ring.
Maybe your groupmates were telling you which way to run.  Maybe
you were two-boxing and could see them on your other computer.

I'm sure the GM has encountered all these and more.
