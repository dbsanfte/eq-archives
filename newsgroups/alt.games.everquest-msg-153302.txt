Bah - we got zilch from the old folks but used to do jobs like weeding and
lawn mowing for the neighbours for whatever they thought fair. There was a
ginger farm down the road and I used to clean up in ginger picking season as
it was 80c a bucket* whether you were 13 like me at the time or 30 like some
of the others.

My parents went overseas (skipping bankrupt proceedings) when I was 15 so I
left school and became a formwork labourer, which again had no junior wage
but you had to work like a dog of course. Lotsa money for the age: 350 AUD
per week in the mid eighties.

One thing I discovered early is if your willing to work hard then money is
never hard to come by, well, at least not in Australia. By the age of 17
though I also figured out getting paid for brawn instead of brains is not a
very good idea so then forged my parents signature to join the Airforce
before my 18th birthday.

It was a good move.

*they were damn huge m-fu*king buckets I can tell you... : /
