I think you are overlooking something.  Normal relationships go through ups
and downs.  Relationships, even good ones, do require some effort from both
parties to maintain.  Throw EQ in there at the wrong time, say during one of
the downs, and one partner stops trying to maintain the relationship, and it
might end where it would have otherwide recovered.

Also, it's not a matter of happiness.  There are a lot of people playing EQ
who don't seem to be particularly happy while playing.  They were when they
started, but now it is something else.  Just because someone does something
a lot doesn't mean they are happy doing it--look at, say, compulsive
gamblers.  They are often miserable, but just can't bring themselves to
stop.
