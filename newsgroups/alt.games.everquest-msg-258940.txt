So you'd say nobody is entitled to say a heart attack is painful unless
he actually experienced one?

Oh come on. He was just suggesting it would not hurt competition but
make it more sporting. After all guilds that share a bit of knowledge on
events could eliminate the more annoying things out of scripts. And you
still have your competition. Sadly you fall back on insult an mockery
here. You could just tell us the proof you obviously have that such a
sharing of strategies isn't a viable option.
Oh and before you ask I do raid. On a very low level compared to you
though.

Elitist dick, sure. The rest - definitivly not.

You already mentioned that you have to wait till the encounter is
unlocked again to try again. So it isn't about death but about wasted
time.
But imagine the simple encounter. It is a unslowable mob who spawns
minions somewhere into the fight. There could be a npc in some pub
sitting and whinig about a battle he has participated. His face
contorted with agony and mumbling 'damn..he didn't even slow down
slaughtering all of us...and all those minions...they were all around
us...nobody saw them coming...'
It would not spoil the script that much, wouldn't it? And it would bring
alot of atmosphere into these encounters. At least in my book.
