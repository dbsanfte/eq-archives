As far as VII and VIII, I hated the techno-fantasy setting. There was
very little fantasy outside the magic system in either of them. Other
games that I like also have technology elements (earlier FF games,
Might & Magic and Wizardry 8 for the PC, ect) but the technology
elements always came secondary to the fantasy elements, not the other
way around as was the case in FF VII and VIII. It's supposed to be
Final FANTASY, not Final Techno With A Smidgen of Fantasy. Plus there
was the fact that the magic system in VIII sucked ass. And then
there's the Guardians. Yes, the little cutscenes for them are
impressive, the first 10 times you see them. But after the 100th time,
you just want to get up and go get a drink. And with some fights
requiring summons 5-10 times because they're your most powerful and
efficient spell, it means that the fights could drag on for 20 minutes
or more, just because of those damn cut scenes you can't skip. The
shorter cutscenes and the more fantasy central setting was part of the
reason why I liked IX better than the two before it. Why I didn't
think it was great was the second major beef I had with VII and VIII,
and I'll outline that below.

I don't like FMV. I liked it better when there wasn't so much detail
that you could see every flat looking emotion on the characters' oh so
stiff looking waxen faces. A good game should make you use your
imagination as well as capture it. Give me the opera scene in FF
III/VI or pretty much all of II/IV over any cut scene in FF VII or
VIII any day of the week. It almost seemed like as Square spent more
attention on the graphics end, they totally forgot how to tell a great
story and make likable characters. In both FFVII and VIII, both the
major characters were unlikable angsty jerks. I ended up liking the
supporting characters more than the ones I was supposed to be
following. This is probably part of the reason why I took exception to
the FMV. Watching a 5 minute long cutscene focusing on a character I
didn't give two shits about was a downright snoozefest. As for the
pre-rendered backgrounds, they're just like the FMV. Pretty looking
eye candy that you can't do jack with. Plus, I HATE isometric
backgrounds where the view is constantly shifting from area to area.
No, I don't like RE or its clones either. Give me a good, consistant
top down, three quarter, first person, or over the shoulder view any
time. At the time FF VII came out, I had to play video games on a 13
inch screen. Going through some of those doors in towns was a pain in
the ass, because you shrunk down to 3 pixels tall and it was like
threading a sewing needle while looking through a telescope. FF IX was
better with the characters, but it still had the same pretty but
untouchable shifting viewpoint backgrounds. 

I started playing the series with FFI on the NES. I've talked to quite
a few others about the series, and I've noticed that many people who
started playing FF with the NES, Gameboy, or SNES titles generally
weren't too pleased about what happened to the series after it moved
to the PS. People who's first FF game was FFVII, who had never even
HEARD of Final Fantasy or Square before Sony's marketing blitz, seem
to drool in anticipation of every new title, no matter what the
quality of the game itself is like. 

It makes me really sad, because I used to be as big a Square fan as
anyone. Back in the days when console RPGs were ultra rare, Square was
the cream of the crop. Their graphics were never the best, but the
great settings, stories, characters, and music (they still have this,
I'll give them that) more than made up for the deficiency in eye
candy. Everyone held their breath in anticipation when a new game was
released in Japan, because it may or may not make it to the US. But
the glory days of FF are over, and Square is just another company
catering to the eye candy junkies at the expense of gameplay and
milking its one major franchise for all its worth.
