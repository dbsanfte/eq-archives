Retaliation in kind has potential for SEVERE reprocussions. Sinking
down to their level could give enemies that lacked resolve just the
excuse they need. It could push borderliners over the edge against us.
It could cause allies to back away from us. These aren't "worst case
scenerios" of potential response. These are very realistic
projections.
