If it was a music industry then it would be musicians being payed to play
music.  Instead it is corporations buying copyright to music from the
musician and then profitting by copying that music a bajillion times and
selling the copies.  That is why I call it a copyright industry.  I don't
have a problem with them making a buck, but I do have a problem with calling
them musicians.  And I especially have a problem with giving them the right
to start blocking parts of the internet through threat of multimillion
dollar lawsuits.
