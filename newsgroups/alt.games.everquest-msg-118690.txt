Any loot hassles I have ever had have been because loot rules were not
specified or newcomers to the group assumed what the rules are. And actually
folks reaction to loot can be a good way to figure out who you want to
befriend on a new server. Better a scrap over a 15pp item than 5K one.

Every loot method has it place and time.

For a new server for a common drop in a sought after camp a first in first
out works well.
Then every one knows when its their turn they get a shield. Newest person to
join group is last on list. As long as the trainer is permacamped the
rotation can continue for weeks.
At least it did on TP when it started and a few of us set up the SBS drop on
a FIFO basis.
