Yes, slight exageration on the part of the OP. ;-)

That's been our experience for sure in all of the trials leading to Kod'Taz.
Not just any Pallys or SKs, they'd better have good numbers and know how to
use what they've got, but it's very doable. This is based on my direct
experience in game with pallys and SKs who've made it all the way through
each of the 6 trials on the way to Kod'Taz, without doing the Smith Rondo
raid. Now, inside Kod'Taz, that I can't speak to, haven't been there yet.

This is my main reason for enjoying the hell out of this expansion and it's
also one of the points on which most players are going to differ. If your
idea of fun in EQ is to sit around in an HoH basement grinding, or clearing
your way methodically through an ldon dungeon that does not repop once
cleared, than GoD is probably not going to be for you. But if you like the
tension, the challenge, the responsibility of figuring out successful
tactics that work in the absence of multiple online guides and walkthroughs,
then you might enjoy GoD quite a bit.

The only substantive complaint I've got is the CR, it's a bitch and way more
difficult than it has to be. With mobs constantly repopping behind you, a
wipe mid mission effectively means game over. That's disheartening, and
decidedly NON-Fun. Stupid decision that needs to be be rethought in light of
experience.

All in all, I give GoD a big thumbs up and I welcome the challenge. All I've
been doing is guild-raiding and GoD expeditions since release, I can't wait
to get back in after I finish this post and go do another.
