Just to put this to rest, for those not familiar with the area, please
refer to this map:

You will note that there is a notation of where the shadowed men camp,
which is at the border of the sand and grass at the very westernmost end
of the zone. If you follow the trail, be it from Kith to EC, or vice
versa, you will not be in any danger from the Shadowed Men, nor will you
see them unless you follow the zone wall, which some evil types may be
tempted to do to avoid guards. In any case, travel with care.
