I took screenshots of some items, and a screenshot of the new item list
index. I'm too tired to stick em on da net now, and i dont really want to
because it will ruin the excitement of drooling at new magical items when
they are fresh out of the oven. I wish i never saw the items but i thought
they where part of the patch update when i saw them and i studied them in
good faith. Hell for all we know those items have always been there as test
LDoN items for GMs or Guides and not for an upcoming expansion at all.

[POSSIBLE SPOILER]
Those items where nice, and nice upgrades for the majority upper end 'casual
gamers', but nothing to be dramatically overwhelmed by if you are
Upper-EP/Time/GoD equipped. The stuff i saw only had 1 aug type7 augument
slot and not the usuall 3 augument slots (type1/type2/type3) we have seen
from classical LDoN armor (atleast those which i saw) BUT some items did
have nice FOCUS EFFECTS already on them without any auguments attached
(neat).
