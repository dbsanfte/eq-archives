So, last night I log on to Xegony and look for a LDoN adv w/ my 55 Iks
Shaman.  Immediately I get a tell from a guy asking if I want to do a BB
adventure.  I say sure, why not.  I get there and group is full once I join
(mid 50's group Paladin, Warrior, Cleric, Chanter, Shaman and the leader is
a twinked to the gills Berserker.)  Should have been a cake walk given the
classes we had I'm thinking...then I think wait...a 57 Berserker?  And he is
our group leader?  This is gonna be bad.  So anyway we get the adventure
(I'm all about giving everyone a shot to prove themselves) and head to the
dungeon.  Get inside after buffing everyone, make pet etc...  Pally pulls
and it's a yellow mob to most of group.  Odd, I think as most mobs are blue
to me in dungeons, so I say "wow, a yellow, don't see those in adventures
everyday" to which the twink/pl'ed 'serker says yeah, they only happen in
hard adventures.  WHAT?  No one said anything to me or the rest of the group
about this being a hard.  The Berserker then says yeah, it's the only way he
feels that he'll be able to keep up the speed leveling that he has been
encountering while still working on his skills.  WHAT???  I ask what his 2HS
and other skills are at.  He says pretty good, around 50 or so!!  Oh shit.
This is getting more ugly by the second.  Then he says, don't worry, he has
uber twink gear and is pretty much raid buffed.  I try to explain to him
that his gear and buffs ain't gonna do jack for him and that he NEEDS to get
his skills higher if he really wants to contribute to a group.  He tells me
he thinks we'll be fine, ok, whatever.  To make a long story short my Shaman
out DPS's him, he starts whining about Berserker being a horrible class cuz
a shammy can out melee him.  Everyone tells him to shut up and at this point
HE decides he wants to kill his toon soooooooo he pulls an entire room onto
the group and pretty much wipes us (rogue and I make it to exit w/ less than
5% health left.  We tried contacting his guild to have someone put him in
line, but they all seemed to be twinks as well and didn't really think that
he did that much wrong.  On the plus side, we booted him from group and
finished the adventure w/ 2 mins to spare (somehow).
