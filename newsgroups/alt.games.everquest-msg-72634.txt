Christmas in Norrath!
(Camping Santa)

Christmas in Norrath would differ by far,
Than singing of Wisemen that follow a star.
When Santa arrived his whip making a crack,
Some ranger would shout, "I've got him on track!"

Then quickly shouts would cross the land,
Let every guild come lend a hand!
We'll mez him, stun, ensnare and dot:
Unleash wizards with fires hot!

The battle with Santa should be a breeze,
Wait! What was that... An AOE Sneeze?
But still it should be over quick.
Then the reindeer began to kick!

DASHER! DANCER! PRANCER and VIXEN!
COMET! CUPID! DONDER and BLITZEN!
They took out the first line of tanks with their hate,
Who knew they could quad for 648!

Despite heavy losses the battle did turn,
One by one Santa's reindeer did fall down and burn.
Then we circled round Santa content with ourselves,
But those sounds from behind us?
Egads! Swarms of elves!

Each carried a cane that cast peppermint shards,
And we found that had muted most all of the bards!
Pets were dispatched to deal with the elves.
Those that could lifetap restored themselves.

We finally focused on saint Nick.
Clerics!
Complete Heals!
Cast them quick!

The battle raged
This would be a tale!
Santa Death Touched a GM!
We all went pale...

A battle so grand it took all we could muster,
and finally Santa lost all his luster.
He stumbled and turned then fell into a heap,
Then all gathered round to see what loot we would reap!

One knelt down slowly and we saw him glower.
No weapons, no armor, no items of power,
Just a scroll wrapped in ribbon?
We were all feeling sour.

So we untied the ribbon and unrolled the scroll.
We read it aloud so that all there could hear.
"HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT." 
And we thought killing Santa was not really bright!
