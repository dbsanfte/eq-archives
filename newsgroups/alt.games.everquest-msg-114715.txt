www.allakhazam.com
http://eq.castersrealm.com
www.eqatlas.com
www.eqmaps.com (free if you click on the "by zone" link)

At least one of the above sites has lots other links but these are great
places to start.

As to the keyboard/mouse thing you mentioned in a later post, thankfully
over the years they've made the game more keyboard-friendly.  It's not GREAT
yet, but you get used to the annoyances.

You can probably remap your keyboard just like it is in Diablo.  I'm taking
a guess there...I've never played D, but I'm able to use close to the same
KB in EQ as I've used over the years with others.

Yeah, give it a month.  If you don't like it, dump it.  Absolutely!  One
suggestion:  GET THE HELL OUT OF EVERFROST.  That place sucks as a brand-new
player location.  Make a halfling of any class.  The town isn't TOO terribly
confusing, and vendors, bank, and newbie zone (Misty Thicket, you do NOT
want Kithicor right away!) are easy to find.  Once you get used to the
interface & game go back to your barbarian.  Oh yeah, and print lots of
maps. :)
