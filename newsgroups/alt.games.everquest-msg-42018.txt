I volunteer for the Birds of Prey Foundation, in Broomfield Colorado.  They
regularly release rehabilitated raptors to the wild.  I have quite a few
pictures of some Golden Eagles that were released last year, and some of Red
Tailed Hawks that were released just a few weeks ago.  I also have several
of Bald Eagles that are still in the flight cages where they are kept and
cared for prior to being ready to go back into the wild.  So if you want
some, I'd be happy to dig some out and email them to you.  Particularly
after I get my broadband connection this coming Tuesday.
