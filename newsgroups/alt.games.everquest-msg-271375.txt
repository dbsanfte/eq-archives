/shrug 

I don't have to read minds to know that a new player, playing a warrior, 
who isn't interested in grouping, and thinks he can compensate with 
buffs is setting himself up for disappointment.

Then for heaven sakes *don't* play a warrior. You will never accomplish 
much. 

Yes, with perseverence, you *will* be able to solo to 70th. But you will 
do it agonizingly slowly, and you will do it in the most boring places 
in the game.

You are *already* living on borrowed time. You are upset now that you 
can't readily get a temp at 14th level, which you feel you need in order 
to reduce downtime, in order make your play time meaningful. 

And you haven't even begun to experience the game yet. Very shortly, 
most mobs that con blue to you will tear you in half. You'll be dead 
before you knock them down to half.  Your life will consist of wandering 
from zone to zone looking for those odd mobs types that don't have a lot 
of hit points, and who don't hit too hard or often. And even they, will 
eat up half or more of your health bar each. Forcing you to sit/bind 
wounds to regain health after every fight (You will take easily 1000+ 
damage every fight, and will need to recover it, before moving to the 
next one.)

You will only be able to challenge a dungeon after it greens out to 
you... and even then if you get a couple light blues or greens on you 
they easily kill you. And corpse recovery will be virtually impossible.

You will be the king of running away. You won't be able to survive adds, 
runners (which cause adds), c-healers will be unkillable by you, slowers 
will shred you, long term disease dotters will send you back to pok.

Yes. I suppose if you don't plan to group, I needn't fear how bad you'd 
be at it. 

Then again... if you don't plan to group - don't play a warrior -, 
especially as a new player in EQ. This isn't some patronising 
condescending, holier-than-thou pontification -- I'm not telling you 
can't do it. I'm telling you, that based on what you've told us:

1) Your new to EQ and thus don't have hoards of fiends, experience, and 
twinkable gear
2) You like to solo and don't like to group
3) You feel you need temp in order to make any sort of reasonable 
progress with your low level warriors.

The conclusion is inescapable: Don't play warrior. You won't enjoy it.

Its like watching a man choose his carreer...

1) I'm new to the workforce
2) I like working with animals
3) I like working with my hands
4) I hate paperwork
5) I hate math, don't understand compound interest, and got through my 
grade 11 math final by cheating with a programmable calculator.

And this guy ... he decides to become a tax accountant.
