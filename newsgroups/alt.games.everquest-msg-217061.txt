I'm hoping that I'll still be able to be a blacksmith / Paladin.  If I have
to take a specific Tradesman class, it'll be a real downer, as SWG's been
busy proving.

Tried one can of New Coke and immediately switched to Minute Maid Orange for
the duration.

I could tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi; I can't tell the
difference between Coke Classic and Pepsi.  (Oh, important thing when taking
"the Pepsi challenge" - note which drink is COLDER.  All 3 times I took the
test on fairgrounds the Pepsi was noticeably colder than the Coke.

As I recall, they were saying a while back that there'd be an "advantage" to
playing both games.  Based on recent changes to EQ, I think they're telling
the truth, and I think I know what the advantage may well be.

Consider:  Originally, we could drop things (including coin) to swap it to
another character.  Then, they stopped coin transfers but we could still do
it for other items.  All the while, they were decrying transferring
equipment between characters on the same account.  Recently, though, they
first added the two new bank slots, and then they added the plat slot.  Now
they're actively supporting inter-character twinking.

Scenario 1:  I log into EQ, fill a backpack with useful stuff, put the
backpack in the new slot.  Oh, and some cash in the plat slot.  I log the
character out, start up a new character, log in, and my newbie has a good
selection of startup gear.

Scenario 2:  I do the exact same thing, but I log out of the game totally,
then log back in.  No biggie, the game has the stuff in bank storage; it
can't be lost.

Scenario 3:  I do the exact same thing, but I log out of EQ, and log into
EQ2.  And lo an behold, my inter-character bank slots in EQ2 are filled with
a bag and some plat from EQ.

Assuming the same database of gear in both EQ1 and EQ2, there's no reason at
all that the characters cannot share equipment.  And the new coding that
specifically allows that via the bank slots might be the very way to do it.
Even if database changes preclude doing it with equipment, it still could be
done with plat.  According to your note EQ2 is supposed to have item decay?
If so, there are still ways to do it that would allow inter-game item
transfer, such as using an empty field from EQ to hold decay stats for EQ2.
The field would be transferred back and forth, but would have no effect in
the one game.
