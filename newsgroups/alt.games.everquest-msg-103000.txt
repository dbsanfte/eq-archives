There are 270million people in the USA. Stupid lawsuits like the one
mentioned here are a drop in the bucket. Filing such a suit is not
"normal" by any stretch.

It is one thing to look for answers. It is another to go hunting for
corporate dollars.

There is dealing with grief, and then there is making a buck off a
warm corpse. The woman in the article should be ashamed of herself,
for:

A. Not getting her child the help he needed
B. Blaming a computer game for the results of a lifetime of mental
problems
C. Talking to a lawyer
D. Cashing in on the death of her child

Judging by her reaction, we can see why her kid was so screwed up.
