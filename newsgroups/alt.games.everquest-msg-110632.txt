There are powergamers there taking advantage of it being an
underpopulated server. However many of the low - mid level
people are their to relax, socialise and RP and you can run
into some very interesting situations.

However the population and the very restrictive ruleset make
grouping *far* more difficult. So a lot of the time I ended
up soloing...at which point your options for RP are rather
minimal.
