There are lots of places you could hunt at this level.  Some that come to
mind that haven't been Mentioned is CT (cazic thule), KC, Kael, and Seb.
Then you got the planes and luclin.  Kael also has several nice drops.  I'd
strongly suggest you go to the bazaar and look up each piece of equipment,
and do a little research on where it drops if its a nice upgrade for you.
Think long term.  You should be finishing up that 5th shawl quest because
that ups your cha up suddenly by 5.  To finish it you need bile wurms off
shard wurms which you can tell if it has it if it glows in night, which also
helps to see if you turn human ( who would of thought night blindness would
help ).  you also need those no drop silks in velks, and hunting at decent
camps while doing them is also very possible.  TS or top shelf would be a
great place to get decent loot and get these silks.  Don't just get those
silks from your own group, let everyone know in the zone you need them if
they just rotting.
Let me just say that for a chanter your charisma sucks, but for a gnome
maybe its not so bad.  The biggest upgrade I can suggest to fix this
situation is the trophy, but you need one trade skill in 250.  So think long
term.  the trophy is primary secondary or range 10 int 50 cha with others
stats.
Personally I think your thinking way too short term, at 52nd you totally
outgrow this 100 and 200 plat upgrades.  You need to start thinking about 1)
get all your spells 2) get enough plat so that if you want a 20 K item or
that KEI you can afford it.
Finally, I don't understand why someone should spend the time to micromanage
your char.  If your not interested in doing the research yourself, why
should someone else do it?  There is definitely alot of information out
there regarding where equipment drops and the stats on the equipment.  Find
out what you want and then find out where it drops.
