My Evolutions just arrived from the US yeterday (not sold here in Oz yet) so
I finally caught up on PoP and LoY. I felt like a 5 year old kid in a candy
store when I first "booked" into the Plain of Knowledge and looked at all
the destinations I could instantly zip to without waiting for the Luclin
Spires to fire... ahh - the luxury.

: )

Plus checking out the game jacket cover and loading screens I felt a little
bit less jaded at the EQ marketing department as well: anyone who makes such
overt and gratuitous use of impossibly large breasted High/Dark Elfettes
cannot be all <that> bad...

*grins*
