Okay, lemme say this again - the mob was NOT hurting me. There WAS no 
down-time.  Try playing a shaman.  At a certain point, you can fight one 
bear at a time and hardly take any damage.  But add two or three (or 
five, which I had on my tail once - ouch!) and I *might* start having 
difficulties.  Pulling in the Halas newbie zone is tough.  When I started 
out, I was getting trains 2 out of the 3 times I tried - even when I 
pulled them back into the trail a bit, the aggro range of some of those 
things seems to be fairly wide - especially the spiderlings.  Anyway.  
Yes.  Point being, I wouldn't have had downtime - but if I have to go out 
and pull again, I risk downtime when more than one attacks, and I'd 
prefer to have the most # of strokes between pulls so I *don't* risk it 

OTOH, yesterday was a lot of fun.  A vengeaful soloist/composer/something 
or other attacked me yesterday in the newbie zone - somebody came up and 
asked if I wanted help.  I said "yes please" and they started whacking 
away too.  And we beat him!  Most people probably won't appreciate it, 
but that felt REALLY good.  Then about 2 minutes later, I saw one 
whacking on *him* - I reciprocated the offer, he agreed, and again we 
beat it off.  The exp on these guys was really good, and I joked that 
with one more, I should be able to ding 7.  2 minutes *later*, *another* 
one showed up - but the guy who'd helped was gone, the newbie area was 
empty... I started to run, then figured "screw it!" and turned around and 
started fighting.  I was out of mana and down to half health, but I 
finally, finally beat him.  All on my own.  Now THAT felt good.

Later on in the day a very kind friend of a friend TPd me out of Halas (I 
was getting bored - the area just before PF dungeon was too full of 
yellows and reds for my taste, with very few blues, and the gnolls at the 
entrance to BB spawned WAY too slowly) over to Butcherblock mountains.  I 
was about to attack a goblin when all of a sudden I saw "Corflunk hits 
YOU for 15 points of damage" - I turn around and yes, there's that big-
ass ogre that scared the crap out of my mage several times when running 
through the area.  I started to hightail it to the guards, and he beat me 
down to less than half health, when I saw in my screen that someone was 
casting a spell - I stopped, figuring I'd sacrifice a little health if he 
wanted the thing and let him taunt it off of me - but instead, as I 
offered it to him, I saw "you feel much better" and my health returned to 
100%.  Wow!  I turned around and conned Corflunk, and the game *claimed* 
it was an 'even fight'.  In reality, I had to be healed 3 or 4 times 
during the fight, and eventually, the guy who was helping ran out of mana 
- but by that time, I finally had Corflunk down to about 5% of mana, so 
he gave it a few kicks to help finish it off.  When it finally fell - 
again, that felt REALLY good.  I fell over myself thanking him, and he 
was very kind - all he'd wanted to do was to see me win and the ogre die.

And a hint for other 'newbies' - if you build up one skill, and then 
someone gives you a nifty weapon that's made for another skill, go ahead 
and practice that new skill on stuff that's fairly easy to beat - but in 
case of emergencies, make SURE you keep your old weapon (or something in 
the same skill class) until you've gotten that new skill up to par - I 
would have KILLED for a 1HB weapon while fighting, because I'd go for 4, 
5, 10 piercing attempts in a row and not hit Corflunk once.  If that 
healer hadn't been around, I would have been forced to either drag him to 
the guards to kill, or died quickly.

And a final question - WHY is there a goblin shaman following this 
Corflunk guy around?
