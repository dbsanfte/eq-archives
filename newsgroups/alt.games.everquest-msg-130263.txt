That's very true.  People want to be able to express their opinions
indefinitely, but don't want to hear those that they, subjectively, deem to
be offensive.  It's a very hypocritical.  But there are those people out
there that truly believe in all forms of freedom of speech.  I personally
believe that no form of speech should be restricted at all.
