Ok on another post someone suggested using Google to search for items like
these and I thought it was a great idea. So I went to Google typed in
recondite+glass+eye and got two matches.  Unfortunately they were both posts
from people wanting to know what it was for.  So apparently no one knows
yet, or if they do, they are not telling.  Either way, I have one too so I'm
hoping you get an answer.
