I stand corrected. Solomen is, indeed, the "final" mob in the epic. But
he's supposedly a no fail turnin. I'm referring to Arantir (sp?) the
hidden one in Halas that poses as a shammie merchant girl most of the
time. You have to deal with him at least three times over the course of
the epic. The broken stage is the second of these interactions.
