No whining from me, thanks much.  Remember, I was sitting (well, floating
... I love Spirit of Eagle) getting mana back at raptors when I get the idea
to check.

Interestingly enough, of the druids that popped up before the 'Too Many'
message, a lot were in places where I assume they were grouped ... Old Seb,
Chardok, PoI, PoD.  Wasn't there an earlier thread (about the time the
Harmony nerf was news) from several who play druids about how no one ever
wants a druid in their group?  Doesn't look like it to me.  I kept my yap
shut at the time because I was just 52 and hadn't grouped a lot in my
travels with the druid.  Since then, I've acquired my Seb key and can
honestly say that I've never really had a problem finding a group in Seb.

I dunno.  Maybe it's just CT, but the only time I find people railing on
druids is when they quad in populated areas like the Ulthork tree in EW.

Or here in A.G.E. when someone brings up something druid-related. :-) <ducks
