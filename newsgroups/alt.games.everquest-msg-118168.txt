IIRC, you don't get FV faction from the outcast type Iksar. You should try
the Sarnaks, tho. For BB, I think killing BB goblins will help and I do
believe that CB gives Kaladim Warrior guild faction; which faction list are
the dock guards on?

Sorry I can't be a bit less vaque, I haven't been in either of those areas
lately.
