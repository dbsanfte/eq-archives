That really is the best solution. Either be the Master Looter or let
the ML know that you're broke and would appreciate getting the peridot
cost up front.

Your average pickup group player is cheap, unless you remind people
very few will go out of their way to cover the peridot cost. Get used
to it and either be prepared to cover peridot costs on your own or
take actions (like being the ML or finding a regular group) so it
won't happen. 

If you want to farm for plat, check out SolA. Easy mobs from 20-30th
lvl (goblins) that can drop fine steel weapons and a few plat. If
you're a good race there's even some gnome vendors in there to sell
to. You won't get as much plat per kill as off of a giant but you'll
kill a lot more of them. ... especially if you pull out your AoE
spells.
