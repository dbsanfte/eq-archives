If you are a melee class under L60 and do not have a ridiculously high
STR and/or lots of Vengeance (or other +ATK gear), main hand weapons
can be reasonably compared by "magic number" vs. delay:
(2*dmg+bonus)/delay
As you gain levels and level appropriate gear beyond 50 your average
hit will surpass your magic number hit.  I've seen high end Warriors
using:
(3.5*dmg+bonus)/delay
Monks might do better than that, as they have a better damage table
than other melees, but I haven't seen any numbers posted.

+Bane damage is added to the weapon base damage vs. the appropriate
target (i.e. my Black Handled Bonebreaker is 35/30 vs. undead and
31/30 vs. other mobs).
+Fire (or whatever) damage can be resisted in whole or in part, when
it is not resisted it works like +bane damage.
Procs are harder to evaluate, unless you can find a parse by somebody
else you trust you probably ought to parse it yourself.  Weapon proc
frequency is affected by DEX and level, and some weapons proc less
often than others.

You can probably find good info on class boards for weapons that are
popular among particular classes (Paladins of Norrath, for example,
has lots of info on Paladin usable weapons).
