Is that what I "seem" to have said? Really now? That's very odd. Because 
that isn't what I said at all.

Good for them. Presumably they can understand the difference between an 
unregulated free market with many participants (e.g. 100) and an 
unregulated free market with 3 participants... because you evidently 
can't. It *seems* in your world if there's more than a couple 
participants the *only* possible explanation is heavy regulation.

Some Ebay categories are good examples of a functioning unregulated free 
market with hundreds of independant sellers of the same goods where in 
those categories pricing based on supply and demand functions nearly 
perfectly. (Many sellers, high substitutable, goods are sold at the 
maximum price they can be sold at to each seller, a textbook ideal 
market)

Of course, the state could be 'heavily regulating it to prop up failures 
and cripple the sucessful'.

Its funny that is what you'd recommend. You see it strikes me that it 
should be you in that course. 

Tell you what, you investigate ebay a little more and let me know how 
much state regulation you find propping up failures and crippling the 
successful. When you don't find any: sign yourself up.
