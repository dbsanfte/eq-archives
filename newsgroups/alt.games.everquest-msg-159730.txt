Both times we were a little understrength and someone looted one of the
medallions off the Acolytes the first time while we were fighting the other
one, and the second time I was doing the right click 'You cannot loot this
corpse' thing on Bloodpriest Loukond  (was not in the group that got xp) and
suddenly got the message 'someone else is looting this corpse' and some
necro popped up... he'd been invis and spamming /loot... which doesn't make
you appear apparently. (I had foolishly destroyed the 2 medallion's of Zek I
had already, figuring we'd get all three when we did it again).
I guess the good news is next time I convince people to do it we can just
wait for the bloodpriest and whack him, don't have to drag acolytes around.

Yes, I'll have a BLT sammich with mayo, mustard and a side of DEATH
