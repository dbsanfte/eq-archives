At high levels clerics get Stun Command, which is a targetable AOE stun
that also does no damage.

Indeed this is why I never use any damage stun unless I"m forced to by need
for chain stunning a caster.  "save the chanter" stuns -must- be the non damage

one, or a non damage root or flash of light... lucky I"m loaded with non damage

spells like that.  My druid is pretty much limited to snaring the mob if he
wants
to be sure he isn't going to overlap a mez and break it...
