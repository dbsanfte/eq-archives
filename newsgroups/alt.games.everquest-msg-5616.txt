Not to be a pest, but if there is a new plane it will be the Plane of
Disease.
BTW, Bertoxxulous rules! You try RPing a cleric of the Lord of Sickness
and see how easy it is!  :)

A lot of these issues you bring up run rampant on the "carebear servers".
As for the PvP environment (which I personally enjoy) I've yet to see it.
If someone is camping, then "off 'em". I'm more of a PvP Teams person.
I think it is easy to gain a few levels (enuff to give you a headstart at
aleast)
before being faced with "PKers".

That's just my 2pp.  :)
