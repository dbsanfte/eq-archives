Wow, I'd have to really care a lot to do that.  Go in to my
newsgroup server thing, find and add that newsgroup, post
to it, then go in and delete it off my list...

Wouldn't it be simpler to just put "test" in my
subject line, and post it to the newsgroup I
already use?

Be another matter if I was posting binaries or something,
but a little text with a warning tag just doesn't seem like
much of a crime.

Of course, I also Jaywalk rather than walking to the corner
and waiting for the light, unless the road is so high traffic
that jaywalking strikes me as a real risk.
