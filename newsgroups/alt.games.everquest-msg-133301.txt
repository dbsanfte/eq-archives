From nexus, zone to SHadowhaven.  Cast Lesser Succor.  You
are at the Paladul line, zone in. Cast Lesser Succor.  You are at
the Shadeweaver line, zone out.  Cast Lesser Succor.  You
are at the Shar Val line, zone in.  Cry about your lost mana.

If you were clever, you bound at the Nexus, so you Gate back!

If I played my druid more, I'd get a list of all Succor points, as its
amazing how much time and annoyance this little trick can save
you.

level boosted up for the much better port set)
