Lately, since about one patch before the last one, I often have EQ crash 
when I camp to character select screen.  It pops up the window asking if 
I want to send the data to SoE.  Regardless of how I answer, it shuts 
down EQ, and I can start it back up again normally, no other errors occur 
as a result of EQ crashing.  I run Win2k, and prior to that, had not had 
any issues with EQ crashing.
