I had to go pull out the EQ maps, all three of 'em (came in the boxes), and
check thinking I had gone loony.  Nope.  The island to the west of Odus is
Kerra Isle.  The expanse of sea between Odus and Antonica is Edud's Crossing.
The island in Edud's Crossing, commonly called Wisp Isle, is most definitely not
Kerra Island.
