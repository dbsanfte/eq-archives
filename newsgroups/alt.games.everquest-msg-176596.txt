Excellent! - I'm over the moon to hear I have joined a game that is
still busy and vibrant. The more I move away from newbie areas, the
more I see this is true.

Thanks for the note - I will never again use the word mysupersales in
a post or an address bar. Besides, Allakhazam, EQAtlas and EQTraders
are now my Gods of information.

Thanks heaps to everyone who responded to my questions.

I have 1 more (hey, that's better than the 46.8 questions I posted
last time right?) for you...

atm, the only in game chat i have is "shout", "ooc" and "auction".
These obviously are not "Chat" per se. I don't have a guild (btw, I am
a casual player - is it going to be possible for me to find a guild,
if so where should I look?) so I am bereft of real chatting.

There seems to have been talk of chat channels that you can join...
but you seem to need to know the name of the channel. How do I find
out about this?

Thanks in advance and happy hunting,
