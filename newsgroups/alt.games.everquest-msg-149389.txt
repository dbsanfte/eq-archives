Cant resist this, Im so easy )

>One theory in sociology says:

"One hypothesis" to be correct, theories by definition are the results
of controlled experimentation, used to explain results of said
experiment to refine next series of experimentation. Hence The
"Theory" of natural selection is better know as "Darwin's Wild Assed
Guess" since it hasnt been subjected to any form of the scientific
method beyond the simple "Remove all blond haired people from the gene
pools and blond hair disappears" type of tripe. Dont even Get me
started on sociology hehe.

Unsupported by any evidence since our current civilization, due to
sociology, encourages stupidity buy sending those who chose not to
support themselves money every month in the form of welfare. Past
civilizations found these deleted from gene pool fairly easy as they
could not survive. Hmm perhaps we are part of an experiment.....

Only one of several explanations, personally my favorite is people who
like sex have more children but that has problems too. Also since
intelligence has not been proven to be genetic or else we all carry
the recessive gene. Seen a lot of stupid kids of smart parents but
thats anecdotal at best.

Not really but its better than talking about EQ for now.
