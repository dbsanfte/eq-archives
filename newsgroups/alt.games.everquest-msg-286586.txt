	Because, grasshopper, it might require a specific code path to
trigger either the leak (or to trigger it enough times to cause memory
problems) or to trigger the bug that causes the program to crash when a 
memory request goes unsatisfied (which is actually a separate bug).  The
effects of the leak could depend on the memory configuration of the host
system, the actual memory map (what's loaded where and when), or even the
precise level of OS patching.

	Interestingly enough, there are commercial packages that will
instrument your code to find memory leaks (purify is a famous one, but
even the basic freeware gnu compiler comes with a trick malloc that does
useful things).  So this might even be easy to fix.
