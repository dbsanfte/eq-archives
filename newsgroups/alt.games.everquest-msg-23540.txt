I had canceled the first time, a month into retail release.  I came back
earlier this year, more specifically in January, and the characters were all
still there.  The number of servers seemed to have more than doubled so
trying to remember what servers I had those old newbies on was a duanting
task to say the least.

Needless to say that pretty much blew me away that they had kept them that
long, the highest being a level 18 druid - who *still* didn't know that he
got med at 12 heh  (and yes, playing that druid all that way without med
pretty much drove me to quitting - kinda funny looking back - knowing about
med now sure made him a lot easier to play.
