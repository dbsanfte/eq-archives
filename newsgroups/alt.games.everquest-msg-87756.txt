I'm guessing you will still be able to time spawns from the last time 
something popped, and that this is just so that all the rare mobs aren't up 
straight after server up. So you can no longer camp by Dyllin's spawn point 
in Highpass and log on right after the patch to gank him. Well, maybe not 
him - he's not exactly high level.

Say you're looking for the Shardwurm Broodmother in Great Divide - she pops 
every 12 hours. Instead of her being there right after server up I'm 
guessing her first spawn will be at some random time within 12 hours of 
server up, then every 12 hours like clockwork after that, as normal.
