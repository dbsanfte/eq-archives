solo the front 6 entrance mobs to The Hole. pull with cancel magic and you
can get them singly.

stay there through 52 and 53.

it will take 3 hours of faction work in the warrens to get a key though. but
its worth it imo.

then orgres/trolls in neriak if you are a dark elf.
necro.eqcasters.com has a forum with the how-to guide

it will take 3 hours of faction work in the warrens to get a key though. but
its worth it imo.
