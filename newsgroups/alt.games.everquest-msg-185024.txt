The largest cost for Sony is not bandwidth. There is no way. The
largest cost for Sony for Everquest is payroll. I guarantee! Software
people still cost money, even in a shrinking job market. I count 6
senior managers. Extrapolating, thats 50 people per manager assuming
they are as lean as everyone else has been in the business. I get
about 300 technical emplyees plus maybe 100 more non-technical. Makes
the payroll somewhere in the area of a couple million a month. That
doesn't include stock options and perks.

I assure you that cutting 20 programmers will net (all included) more
than $150k. Maybe they already did that. Perhaps they already cut out
bagels in the break room, and fired the pretty secretary in the front
office. I assume they have more then a few hundred employees on
Everquest and the recent versions of software we have seen.

OC12 line with 622Mbit of bandwidth is about $30-$40k monthly. OC48 is
about double that $60k (~2Gbit) The guess is how many oc48 lines do
they use?

You can't cancel a OC-48 line overnight, those are on contract. You
want them to be at full or near full capacity before even getting
another line. Expensive to feed them as well.

As far as dial-up vs Cable, Cable numbers have stabilized. People drop
cable service as well as add it. There is no data to say that EQ
people are more cable hungry than normal users. I may agree that more
EQ users ARE getting cable but that is a guess on both our parts.

I do say that Sony saves little by dropping AFK users.

No comment. I assume you are not in management or a technical
business.
