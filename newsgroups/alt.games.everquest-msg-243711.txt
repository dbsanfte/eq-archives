Shut the fuck up if you don't know what you're talking about, Scott.
You obviously don't.

RP guilds can be found on other servers, Bob. Better RP than I've ever
found on FV, IMO. On Tunare, you'll find a pair of guilds dedicated to
RP called Wind Riders and Shadow Striders. They've been around almost
as long as EQ has. They're set up in opposition to each other, and are
a generally fun crowd. Their website is http://wind.jerhyn.com . Also,
they have an OOC chat channel. /join wrooc if you ever pop in on the
Tunare server (or you can check it from another server with /join
tunare.wrooc). Feel free to pop in and say hi.

Just note, they don't have uber guild raid events or anything like
that. It's a family RP guild. They put more focus on RP than raiding.
