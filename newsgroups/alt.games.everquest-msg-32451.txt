Well, because this was in Paw, where 3 often come whether you want
them or not.  And because we had to make do with whoever was available
outside.  And I think you are overestimating the effectiveness of
Root, at least of the one my 31 cleric can cast.

No, they were even worse when we had an enchanter :)  (BEFORE I
started telling them they needed to protect their cleric, I might add)

This I most strenuously disagree with and is in fact the point of my
post.  As I said, in my opinion the tank's *primary* job is keeping
the mobs off the casters, not damage dealing.  IMO losing the services
of a caster because he is engaged is far more detrimental to your
chances of surviving the encounter than a small amount of delay in
taking out the initially targeted mob.

Yes.  This was more or less what I was saying.

Not randomly.  Better to have only one caster-protector, sure, but
even if all of them switched the one they were beating on would still
have been way more pissed off at them than it was at me.  Get
everything off the casters, then switch back to the original mob.  Not
exactly rocket science.

But you're right about discussion being good.

I wasn't running "aimlessly."  I was running back and forth in the
pit.  The mobs have strange pathing and head out towards the double
doors before coming around to the other side.  A smart tank would have
followed me, stood in front of me and taunted as they came running in.
They instead just chased aimlessly after the mob and got frustrated.

And I don't agree that running is *never* the solution.  See another
reply I made in this thread.
