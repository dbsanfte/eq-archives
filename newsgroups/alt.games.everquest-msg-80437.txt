I am merely a big fan of LOTR but my partner is a raving lunatic on all
things Tolkien (listens to tapes of The Silmarillion in the car fer pete's
sake!) and keeps me well informed on every snippet about the movies (whether
I want him to or not) so I can tell you that

a) Ents are in the next one and the voice of Treebeard will be John Rhys
Davies who also plays Gimli.
b) can't say if it's the same for US but the DVD for the UK comes out in
August.
