The * Bayle servers are in various places around Europe. All the
others are in California. All of them are about the same in terms of
reliability, that is, very good. Occasionally a zone does crash, but
rarely an entire 'server'. Each 'server' is actually made up of many
computers running different zones, and like all hardware, it sometimes
fails. I have seen entire servers crash before, but it's rare.
