I was putting together a group to go back in when a paladin walked up
and said "who wanted the Ireblind Imp?".  I said me and he proceeded
to zone in and solo the damn thing.

We only had 5 people in the group at the time so I sent him a tell
asking if he wanted help, he said sure so that was that.

Got the piece I needed and now I'm one trial away from my Berserker
epic 1.0.  Guess it's all about the right class eh?

Thanks for the info and tips.

~F
