   Here it is, direct cut and paste from google.  I'm a little
hurt that Biz would refer to the sum of my internet modeling as a
"joke"... but that is okay.  The link still works.  The PG
warning about looking at it around kids or at the office still
applies.

/cut 'n' paste start

   I finally got a gig as an advertising model on a web site!  So
have a look at me if you want.  Note, this isn't a hard-core
site, but it's defiantly PG something.  You might now want to
click on the link if you are at work or if there are kiddies
around, or if you are of a sensitive nature and easily offended.
