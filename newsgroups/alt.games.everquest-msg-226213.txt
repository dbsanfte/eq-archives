    That's the one I described in another thread, the melee-only boss that
hits very hard and very fast. Combine that with no pauses for spellcasting
and you have a mob that's usually a very unpleasant surprise.

    Then people would preferentially do assassinations, since you'd be
guaranteed a shot at loot. I've found rare research items on bosses, and gem
table items. I think if bosses were guaranteed to have a planar gem table
item that people would be happy, but they wouldn't preferentially do
assassinations just for the extra 150-220 pp.
