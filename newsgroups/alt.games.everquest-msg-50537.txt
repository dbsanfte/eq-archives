Ok, the charred guardian shield.  One hundred percent magic resistant so if
your rogue is afk the warrior has to tank it, the cleric heal, druid damage
shield & backup heal, enchanter speed the warrior, and the mage sends his
pet (with same buffs) or wizard sits out.

The Clockwork EXG and her placeholders are roamers.  That's the ONLY roaming
clockwork so you don't have to kill a whole lot of your gnome faction at
all.  I think respawn time in SolA is about 20 mins, so that's only 3 hits
per hour.   If you set up on the non-clockwork side of the bridge, right
next to the bridge, you shouldn't have any trouble with adds until she
starts running.  At that point the enchanter should be ready to mez and mem
blur.

After you're done with her just go to SolB for xp.  After a couple hours
you've more than made up for the faction hits taken in SolA (regarding the
tink bag vendor, anyway...merchants in Ak'Anon faction doesn't improve in
SolB).
