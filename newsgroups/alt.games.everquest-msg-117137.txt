One quick note:

A guild capable of awaking the Sleeper doesn't care.

Think about it...if you can put a single-guild force together
that has enough Sleeper's Keys and enough classes and
damage to awake the Sleeper, you don't "need" another
guild.

You can kill Tormax as a guild.  You can kill Yelniak as
a guild.  You can clear Orc1 as a guild ( ;-)  ). You can
get to Greig and show him how pretty his corpse looks.
You can at LEAST raid Sshazzra, and take on a Ring
of Fire or Cazic Thule camp for loot.  You can take down
the Burrower Parasite.  This is all as a single guild
raid.

Why would the guild _as a whole_ care about what
a second or third tier guild thinks of them?  Individual
members can always claim they were against the
decision if they catch flak on a non-guild group, but
the bottom line is that a guild capable of taking down
the Sleeper doesn't _need_ the rest of the server
at all.  They have the loot, and the loot they don't need,
they can put together a raid to get it.

I'm not saying I agree with it, but it's not the same as
a single player ninja-ing  a CoF from Naggy at level
48...rep in EQ is what gets you into groups or pickup
raids or help from outside sources...most uber-
guilders have no need of any of that.
