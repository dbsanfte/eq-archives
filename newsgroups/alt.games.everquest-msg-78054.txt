Another option at 12 is to trot your DE off to Paineel and the Warrens
(actually doable before 12, but that's an okay level). Spend a few level
killing kobolds, collecting molars and selling your loot to the druid
merchant in Toxx. You'll eventually be able to bank and train in Paineel,
and then Stonebrunt becomes attractive at about 24. Plus it's always nice to
have a home away from home that's near a Nexus spire.

I did this with my human SK worshipper of Innoruk so I'm assuming it's
doable for DE Necros.
