Why do you want to join a guild anyway?  Just to have a chatroom?

I read through your whole tale, and I can tell what you don't want out of a
guild.  You don't want a guild that raids.  You don't want a guild with any
focus or purpose.  So that means you want a chatroom as far as I can tell. 
You know, you can keep IRC or ICQ open while playing EQ.  :)
