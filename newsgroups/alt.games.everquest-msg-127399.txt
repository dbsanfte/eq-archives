Ok.  I've been to -some- of those nations, and seen first hand what they're
like.  You talk about history and likelyhood.  Extrapolation is nice, but it
dosn't always tell how things really turned out.

Seemed to be an unnecessary point, though.

If you will look back, my statement is as a response to the suggestion that
the Islamic people are all evil and idotic.  My statement is an accurate
description of the state-run media and education in many Islamic nations.
Do you think you can run an article or advertisment sympathetic to America
in an Iraqi newspaper?  This is the isolation of ideas that many Islamic
governments maintains.

That's me, the big racist.  You got me pegged.  I wondered when someone was
going to play that card.

I thought that was understood.  Of course, since I was responding to an
attack on -all- arabs, I guess I forgot to put that caveat in there.  Next
time, I just won't try to defend them.
