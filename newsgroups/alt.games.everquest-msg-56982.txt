I don't see how this hurts druids...maybe for pick up raids, but I
haven't done one of those since Hate back in Spring 2000. 

I think it's a large help as a cleric...just wanted to hear others
opinions on it, especially since right now..there aren't more than about
4 or 5 really good group buffs that Verant allowed.

Now when Luclin comes out (and if they decide to include stuffl ike group
Aego), I can see the value of this increasing by a whole lot
