Technically, I suppose you are right, but there are things from RL you
can't take into the game... I may be opposed to hunting in principle,
but that attitude won't get me out of level 1.

On the other hand, the fact that wolves and bears are amiable to Druids
appears to me as evidence of a special bond between them, and killing
them seems to me like a betrayal of trust. Of course, I don't preach in
game (and I don't plan to play a Druid in the RP server), but part of my
enjoyment of this game is making it something more than the perpetual
pursuit of Phat Lewt...
