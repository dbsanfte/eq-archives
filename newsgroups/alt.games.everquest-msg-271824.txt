It must be servers, time of day, karma, who knows? I've met one rude 
jerk-of-a-player on EQ in the past three years. I haven't met a jerk yet on 
EQ2. Shadowbane brought two to my attention, one on Horizons, but the most 
irritating players were found (for me) on SWG. Again, it must be the 
conditions (server, etc.) not the game.
