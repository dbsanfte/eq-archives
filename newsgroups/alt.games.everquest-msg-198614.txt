Why? Someone built the Millenium Falcon. Someone designed the Storm
Trooper body armor. Someone maintains the firearms for the Empire, as
well as the Rebellion. Do they make good heros? No. Does everyone who
plays have to be a hero? No. You go be a hero. I'll be just as happy to
sit back and make a few virtual credits off your bravado. 

Note that 'essential to the success of the game' does NOT mean 'Every
player has to learn a tradeskill'. Far from it, from what I have read it
is very much meant to be set up with having some people as crafters,
some as 'heros'. So you go enjoy your 'hero' thing, I will enjoy my
'crafter' thing, and we are both happy. Why is your way the One True
Way? Why should we all have to play like you?
