Well I know that if your going from Freeport to OOT and then to BB....
that the landing in OOT is on the dock on sister Island...  If sister
Island is an issue for you... it will be on port in...   I got killed
there with my young Gnome Mage.  I had to get the message typed in
advace to get it out quick enough for my second trip.
