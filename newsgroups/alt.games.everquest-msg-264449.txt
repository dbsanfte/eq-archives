Didn't think you would; they don't stray into anything even related to
age or csipgr (at least not that I've seen.)

That's not quite the comparison I was making.

I participate in behaviours you classified as immature and uncivilized
(or juvenile and barbaric.)  Knowing that, how could you possibly
*not* think I was juvenile and barbaric?

Unless you're implying that I might not be honest about my behaviours;
but that would mean you're trying to call me a liar without getting
mud on your hands by actually saying the words.

Again I question the breadth of your experience.

And give the other no chance to redeem him/herself?
How is *that* mature and civilized?

I wouldn't say that;  rather, I'd say you're 'out of your element'
when brought out of said gaming group - as has happened in this
crosspost.

The conversation drifted towards biases based on how one posts to
usenet.  I posted my own experiences regarding such, as a relevant
contribution to *that* particular piece of the conversation.  

It's admittedly off-topic to both the newsgroups this thread is posted
to and the original topic of the thread itself, but so is the rest of
the conversation.
