My borther in law, my brother, and I all play this game.  My in-law has a 41
cleric, and 31 pally, and a 35 bst, and just started a inky necro on friday.
For the last 2 or 3 weeks, I have been saving all spiderling islk, spider
silks, swatches, threads, pelts, leather paddings that I have either come
across, or made myself for his cleric who told me "I am doing tailoring, so
save me your tailoring supplies you come across"  Well, I had no problem
with this, as I wanted to start a druid, so went out and even made a couple
days into supply gathering days.  I gave him over 10-12 stacks of spiderling
silks, 10 stacks of silk threads, 5 stacks of leather padding, 6 stacks of
HQ cat pelts, a bazilloin MQ & LQ pelts, even a stack of HQ bear pelts, 45
HQ hopper hides, and I even took my brewing skills out and made him over 20
stacks of heady kiolas out of my own money.

Last night he is playing his level 8 necro and says in our chat channel
"WOOT! I just sold 3 stacks of spiderling silks for 200pp in the Plane of
Knowledge!" ...

I said "WTF? I spend WEEKS gathering supplies for you for FREE (yes read
that FREE), and you take your alts WHO ALREADY HAVE SOME STUFF, and sell it
off for money for yourself?!?!??!!?!?"

He says "Thats different, the necro got these on her own!"

I said "It doens't matter, your alts should be giving your main the
supplies, especially if you ahve other people helping you with it for free,
your making lots of money off of the very same items WE could have been
selling, but gave to youinstead:

He says "How am I suppose to play my character if I cant get any money for
spells and whatnot?"

I said " You do whatever other player does, buy what you can and go fight in
places to make more money for spells"


ANyways, I got mad ... I figure if you have alot of people helping you get
supplies for trade skills(which usually takes a long time to gather) and
then you take your alts and go sell all the exact same stuff that your
friends are gathering for you, then your being pretty ignorant to your
friends.


I ased mt friend who helped my druid by doing the very same thing for me,
what he would have done if I told him I sold some of the very same supplies
off my alts while he was giving me his time by gathering them up for free
... he said he would never assist me again with anything.


What do you all think? Did I overdo the reaction ... and keep the answers
based on what is written above, not the well what if stuff .. there is no
what if stuff, the aboive came out of the my log files.

PS - On ym server the total cost of the supplies he got out of me for free
is alittle over 3500pp give or take, not to mention How much I would charge
anyone else for taking up  TWO weeks of my playing time.
