The damage cap by what I can tell below level 20 is 2 times the damage of
the weapon max. After level 20 you will average 2-2.5 times the damage of
the weapon and peak at the max output for the weapon. www.castersrealm.com
has a good weapon breakdown for max speed and damage. I do not know how
accurate the formula is just a guess from my exp with my Monk and Pally.
