Well for my casting skills, this was actually the reverse of my 
experience; as an SK, there are many caster skills I don't use much at 
all, at least so far.  Although I'm familiar with the plan of sitting 
somewhere safe and chain casting to get those skills up, I just hadn't 
bothered.  Well, stuck sitting 10 or 15 minutes at a time between runs 
due to the lockout, I finally got around to doing this.. including 
taking my divination from (1) to (100).

Combat skills, though, well thats different, there's no convienient way 
to make up for those... and for a cleric, missing out on low level 
maxing of the Defense skill is real trouble, at high levels, playing 
Tank can be downright dangerous even with mere dark blues at that point.
