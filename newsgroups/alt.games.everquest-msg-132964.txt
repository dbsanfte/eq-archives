Then she and I are in agreement on THAT issue..

Now, the only contention is what can a 2 yr old "handle"??

Lesa's 2 yr olds appear ready for quantum mathematics and Stephen
Hawking's View Of The Universe Theory As It Pertains To Time Travel

I doubt the average 2 yr old is ready for such concepts...

Why isn't there ANYONE who can debate w/o resorting to personal
attacks??

You think?  And, of course, you have PROOF of this, correct??  

Or are you simply stating YOUR opinion?

Actually it didn't originally stand for either...

But in it's current incarnation it stands for Excellence & Quality....

Excellence & Quality
--------------------------
Excellence is the result of caring more then others think is wise,
risking more then others think is safe, dreaming more then others
think is practical and expecting more then others think is possible.
===========================================================
Don't Follow The Crowd.  Think For YOURSELF!!
