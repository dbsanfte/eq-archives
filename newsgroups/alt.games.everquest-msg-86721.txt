I have been needing thicker skin recently too. I just turned 30 with my
druid, and have gotten stiffed  on ports already. After they promised to
pay. Then yesterday, someone is crying about their corpse and I happen to
run across it. He was offering 30 pp to bring it to mill (I was in LOIO) so
he consented me and I dragged it 5 feet at a time for a half hour to the
mill, almost dying once myself. All the while he is sending me tells , "
where are you dude" never mind that I am female LOL. Anyway , he is gone
when I get there and all of last nite. This morning he is on but ignoring me
when I send tell asking about if he got his body ok. Then I finally get thru
to him and he says he will pay me 17pp and I have to meet him at left ledge.
I cannot find ledge and tell him. That is last I see of him. NOw i am upset
