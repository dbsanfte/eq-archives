If their "ban an account" procedure is as inherently error-prone as their
"disband a guild" procedure, there *will* be some people banned who should
not have been.  Remember when they disbanded guilds that were below the
minimum size?  The basically produced a listing for each server of the
guilds that needed to be zapped, by guild ID number, and the GMs had to use
a command to delete the guild by number.

Result: typing mistakes gave valid guild numbers, and so some guilds were
incorrect deleted.

Hopefully, the procedure that identifies the cheating accounts also handles
the deletion, so it will be accurate, but if it is not, I will not be
surprised.
