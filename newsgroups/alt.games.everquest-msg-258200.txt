It has always been effectively impossible for a -player- to complete 
quests in EQ. Most interesting everquest quests are collective efforts 
requiring collaboration of the entire playerbase to solve. 

Even simpler ones like the cleric Ro armour which has several ground 
spawns. A single player would probably never find them all even if he 
spent a year looking. And some of those ground spawns are on 8 hour+ 
timers... so if someone does stumble on it and loots before the cleric 
arrives the cleric will -never- find it even if he scours every inch of 
every zone...

To solve quests you need hordes of people reporting item drops, item 
lore (identify info), npc dialog (at different factions), ground spawns, 
combine attempts, vendor sold items, the text on 'rolled up notes' and 
books, npc names, faction hits, etc etc etc.

Allakhazams has a lot of that stuff, but not all of it, and its not 
presented in a good quest solving format. 

To an extent allakhazams even works against solving unsolved quests, 
because it guides the majority of players down existing known paths, 
instead of letting them bang their heads against things, and possibly 
finding new information.

Too true. You also forgot faction issues.

Completing the quest is the reward. Don't -ever- worry about the 
result... that way the 1 in a thousand times its something you'd use you 
can be pleasantly suprised instead of spending all your time 
disappointed. That said I still think no-drop lengthy quest reward items 
should be usable for significant tribute or even adventure points... so 
at least their is always a tangible reward for completing them.
