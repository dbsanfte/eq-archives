It can be overdone tho, especially by kneejerk "I read a guide and
now I know everything types".  More than once my Paladin died when
some Warrior refused to run until everybody else did, nevermind that
with LH I have a much better chance to get clear (or to an easy rez
spot) than he does.  Eventually I realized that it was far better to
let stupid Warriors take their unnecessary deaths, "natural selection
at work".
