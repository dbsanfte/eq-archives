Hello everyone,

I have this random problem with the game.  What happens is that
suddenly I have an extra cursor in the middle of the screen that
flickers between a regular looking cursor and the hour glass.  When
this happens suddenly the game starts acting *really* laggy - the lag
meter doesn't change but it becomes really jumpy and makes the game
practically unplayable.  Last week it was really bad so I formatted
the HD.  Unfortunately it started happening right away.  So I checked
what DirectX I had.  EQ had only installed DirectX 7.0 and it requires
7.0a so upgraded to that.  At this point the game worked fine, so I
thought I had solved the problem although I was pretty sure I had the
correct DirectX prior to formatting.  But last night it started
happening again.  It only happened once and after I restarted the
computer it didn't happen again but I am at a loss as to what could
possibly be causing this.  I do not want to spend another week
restarting my computer a million times a night!! Here's my computer
info:

Athlon 1.1 GHZ
ATI Radeon 64MB
128MB RAM
Soundblaster sound card
56K modem (hopefully DSL soon)

Does anyone have any thoughts?  I'm ready to call in an exorcist!
