}Some of the third person views, after suitable adjustment of the camera
}postion, let you see the ramp well before you get to the edge.

They may also be higher level... Once you get to about level 10 or so, 
you're no longer in danger of actually dying if you fall.  So if you run 
back and forth across kelethin really fast 8 times, and fall once, you've 
still saved time overall.

And now it doesn't matter if you -do- die before level 10, just means you 
have a new express route to the bottom of the nebie lift.
