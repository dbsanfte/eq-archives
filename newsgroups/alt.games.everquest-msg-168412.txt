Oh is it? But you feel completely at ease insulting other people over
their playing time.

You would lie because you've been caught in a quandary. Say it too
high and you paint yourself with the same brush you used on the other
guy (a dork). Say it too low and everyone will assume you're a noob.
So, regardless, you're going to go for the best balance you can find.
*shrug*

Them's the breaks when you decide you can pass judgements on people
you know nothing about.
