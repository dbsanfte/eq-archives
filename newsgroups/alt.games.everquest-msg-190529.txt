First off, which server are you on?  There's people in here on just about 
every server who are happy to help.  Just be polite about it and don't 
act like anybody owes you anything.

Second, get thee to a bank!  There you can exchange your coins of lesser 
value for (much lighter) coins of greater value.  The exchange rate is as 
follows: 1 platinum = 10 gold = 100 silver = 1000 copper.  To perform the 
exchange, simple hold down shift and click on the denomination you wish 
to exchange, then click on the next higher denomination.  You can only do 
this at a bank though.

Check www.eqatlas.com for some of the best maps around.  If you have the 
Legacy of Ykesha extension then you can get realtime updates of where in 
the zone you are by using the cartography tool.  The route to the bank in 
Qeynos is a bit complex.

The next thing you're going to want to do is procure a magic weapon (when 
you look at the stats it will say "MAGIC ITEM" at the top).  If you use 
the auction channel to try to purchase one (/auction WTB a magic weapon.  
I have #pp to spend, please send a tell if you can help me out.(replace 
the # with however much plat you have)) you might just get lucky and have 
one given to you by a nicer higher level character.  Important tip: don't 
beg, it will get you adverse results.  With a magic weapon you will be 
able to eventually kill willowisps, which drop lightstones (sells to 
merchants for about 1pp each) and greater lightstones (sells to merchants 
for about 4pp each, but if you give them to a gypsy in north karana or 
somewhere in north or south Ro you will get 9pp each for the book they 
give back to you).  This will get you some decent money and some 
experience at the same time (really the best of both worlds).

As for where to go...  If you haven't gone past north qeynos, head into 
qeynos hills.  If you have, and the stuff is starting to turn green there 
(text shows up in green when you target something and hit 'c') then you 
might try heading to Blackburrow or into West Karana.  When you hit level 
12 or so, try going to the West Commons to hunt the Willowisps I 
mentioned above.

Other than that, try to get some gear that has raw HP on it.  And never 
pass up a chance for some free buffs (though begging for them is 
generally considered bad form).  I've noticed lately that on the Karana 
server there's enough MGB KEI, Aego and Virtue that if you timed it right 
you'd never have to pay for it again :P

Good luck to you, and if you're playing on the Karana server feel free to 
send me a tell, I'll come help you out a bit when I get a chance,
