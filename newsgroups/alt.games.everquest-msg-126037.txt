It's rough if you're not an Enchanter or a Druid with wolfform. There's two
options I think. First there's a dwarf who spawns in the back of the Mino
cave in Steamfont. If you're high enough level that you won't get attacked
by the minos you can camp him for positive Ogre faction, including Clurg,
with negative dwarf faction hits.

You can get your baking skill up a bit and make froglok pickles. Hunt
froggies in the swamp and make up a few stacks of pickled froglok. Go
invisible, zone into Ogguk and have a friendly druid cast wolfform on you.
Give your froggie pickles to the female ogre standing near Clurg for
positive factions.

During the Karanas plague there was a bread quest that you could run for
good ogre factions but I understand that's gone now that the plague is over.
