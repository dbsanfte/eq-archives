Lol - I, and any player with a clue, laugh my ass of at people
who say casters suck.  The massive damage output of a mage, the
incredible utility of an Enchanter, and Necros, don't get me
started - Best puller I ever saw was a necro (group jumps on
target - necro sends pet - runs off, brings back another, ST's
it and waits for the first to die, everyone jumps on it -
rinse repeat.)  One of the few true chain pulling situations
I've ever seen :).  And wizards, well, I have quite a few 
friends who are wizards (and now that some are epiced, they
are 2nd in line for mod rods - an epic wizard can make far
better use of that mana nuking than I can) 

Another great group I was in was Necro, Necro, Mage, Mage, Mage
in FG.  (Before anyone asks, the logs from that went away when
I reinstalled Win 98 a while back, but they clearly showed all
5 pets hitting the mob in a short span of time.)
