  I did.  Many people did.  The simple fact about Luclin and the DX8 engine
is this:

  They rushed.

  Neither the expansion or the DX8 engine were clearly ready for prime time,
but they were determined to make their self-imposed deadline no matter what.

  And we all paid the price.

  Mistakes happen, mistakes can be forgiven, but this one, in my opinion,
was inexcusable.  I'm leaving EQ for a couple months, until I get my new
machine built which should be able to comfortably support EQ, and until
Verant straightens out this whole mess.  I hope for you and everyone else
things "get back to normal" and you can enjoy all the great expansion
content soon.
