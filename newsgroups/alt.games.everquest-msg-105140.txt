I don't know if this has changed, or what. A friend of mine had his
last name removed by a GM, did /surname again, and got removed again.
This happened a couple of times. He was putting in stupid names,
"Koskthx" and the like. Eventually they changed his last name to an
underscore, "_". It's not visible to other players, but only to him in
the upper-right corner of his screen.
