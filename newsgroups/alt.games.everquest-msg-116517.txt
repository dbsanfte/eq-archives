Also notice this...

If I were to dual another warrior of a similar level we would sit there for
quite awhile...I mean I think I would die after the first couple of
hits....Someone dual wielding big arse swords and hitting me would most
likely kill me out-right. More and more realism although try to stay in a
fantasy world where everything is based on things that arent real...

www.archaean.com when that game gets back up and running whenever it comes
out it shall be great!
