Read back carefully.  "They" didn't mention a necro.  They mentioned a
"rezzer" and specifically said "for the rezzer to put EB on you."

Rezzing characters who can "put EB on you" are few and far between,
namely Necromancers and EB casters who have a Staff of Forbidden
Rites.  Both these cases are almost exclusively reserved for emergency
rez of a cleric in a really hard to recover from Total Wipe Out, in the
one case someone needs to lose a level of exp to provide the material
component, and in the other, you are looking at a drop off Vox or
Naggy (or both?  Not sure which drops it, and its not an always drop
item) and in neither case is it likely to be the sort of thing that a mere
CR in an airless zone would warrant.

can't cast EB to save my life... or yours for that matter
