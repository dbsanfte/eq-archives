Indeed. But then science hasn't even begun to address the question of
what caused the universe, and positing that 'it was a spontaneous
effect without a cause' is at least equally improbable and no simpler
a position than 'God caused it'. Thus Occam's Razor doesn't argue
against the existance of God. (Although it does argue against most
observed 'miracles', including large sticks from the sky.)

Its the best place from which to stimulate thought. If ones beleif
system isn't challenged one never has an opportunity or reason to
refine or even discard it. So many people have completely irrational
belief systems simply because they've never examined them.
