ok, I was being stubborn and defensive, and a little rude, and I was wrong.
I'm sorry

I still have an opinion though.  I see that you only need to earn the points
to unlock higher items, and you can only buy items at a camp that you have
earned that much points at.  When you buy that item, are you not essentially
using the points earned at that camp?  Given that, we've been arguing the
exact same thing.  You're unlocking the camp by earning a certain number of
points, and then spending those points on an item.
