Yup, the plan is to have an extremely small server. Team work will
absolutly be required, even more than now, to obtain the high end
goals.

Twinking/powerleveling will pretty much be non existant. Oh sure a
very small percentage will have two accounts and two computer, but its
obvious if someone wants to twink/power game so badly that they
actually have two computers set up to do it, they obviously like to
take the easy path, and will not waste thier time on the most tedious
and aggravating EQ server of all time.

with few things being no drop, it may also mean that vendors will now
buy they stuff they used to say "I will give you absolutly nothing
blah blah". And they may actually give decent money for them.
I doubt it, but still.

Brad said on the main board a while back that they would fix the
details with TLC/Quests/no drop issues "as they arrive", which means,
it will be rocky for a while.
