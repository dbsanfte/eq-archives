Huh? The mobs are just as hard in slaughter and collection, no? If you can
kill 90 in 90 minutes (or whatever number it is), you can do it regardless
of mission type. The only difference is how fast you succeed and your chances
of success.

I guess this might have something to do with it. They're pretty frequent in
my experience - sometimes you have to replace one or two people, but generally
folks continue just fine if you're killing and winning fast. I in fact
experience the opposite to you - win, fast, leave the nameds and XP, do another
one. Who cares about drops that are so frequent they cost peanuts in the bazaar
compared to a Vengeance IV augment or another 40hp slapped onto your existing
gear?

I guess it depends how you LFG. I send tells to folks I know are 'good', and
folks on my friends list, leave LFG up, and go duo or solo somewhere while I
wait. It can take 30 minutes to get a group I like enough to go, but its not
'dead time' at a wayfarers camp in the meantime, and frequently it takes far
less time.

I dislike LDON enough to make sure its going to be a decent group though, I
really prefer 'old-EQ'.

Mmm. I guess its a server thing. I encounter 'anything but collect' often,
but never (yet) 'nothing but slaughter'
