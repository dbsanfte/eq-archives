I don't know about your server but on Erollisi Marr, I rarely find the
sisters camped in OOT.  Good exp at same levels as sirens, but much much
better loot.

I actually have seen a few people leveling up here.  Some rl friends
that play, were fighting here, with a 16 druid and a 35ish cleric
overseer in case things went south for a while.  The giant skeletons
have a huge level range I have noticed while tracking stuff with my
druid.  As an evil you need to watch out for some of the mobs, I deleted
my little ogre shaman after running into one of the sphinxes, and then
dieing twice while trying to recover the corpse.  In a fit of
frustration said fuck this, and deleted the character.

This may be somewhat problematic for you, not sure.  You will have to do
a bunch of faction work I would think to easily take the boat out of
Qeynos go get there.  I haven't taken my necro to Qeynos yet, but I know
I am kos outside of the sewers.  I know you have done the troll so you
aren't above faction work, but you may find growing up in fp area, by
the time your ready to hunt wisps, they will be green by the time you
can safely take the boat out of Qeynos.  Maybe it's just me but Qeynos
boat seems much more cut off to evils than the one out of freeport.

I tried the tower at 16 I wasn't overly impressed, as I seemed to get
jumped by everything as IVU would drop at the most inconvient times, and
it was almost all green on entry floor, but tough to kill sans pet.

I have to agree here, just too many adds to make this feasable solo. 
Now team up with an enchanter, and you might be good.  This was why I
headed to Sister Island after my work schedule had me on afternoons, and
i lost the ability to group up with the usual friends in unrest, and
it's empty during the day here in the states.

Only thing i found with Warsliks is that it's hard to see potential adds
with all the trees.  My POS computer doesn't like the trees much either.

Well as a necro the goons should not be a concern for him, however I did
find that along the wall of the outpost, there is now an iksar I think
for the new sk weapon quest.  I got lucky in that he seems to have a
small aggro radius.  I was near him when i logged in and he is
definitely scowl to attack.  I found OT at 16 to be too hard for my
tastes.  Was usually going oom after every pull even with dark pact up. 
And god forbid if my casting pulled it off my pet.  All you can hope for
when a rhino is smacking you is that FD works.

I am probably going to finish 16 in Oasis of morons and then head to Rth
Mtns to try my hand at the basilisks again.
