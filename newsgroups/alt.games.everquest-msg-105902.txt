Aonalin, secretly known to himself as Beetlfuud, volunteered
to test the The Emperor's New Armor (tm) at L1.  Added to
the results produced by valiant cousin Beetmi we now have
a somewhat more detailed picture of the effect of armor
and Defense skill on combat.

Both characters are human paladins, they wear no jewelry,
carry no shield, have no buffs cast on them, and are either
naked or wearing full banded armor.  character stats are:
str85, sta100, agi75, dex75, wis80, int75, cha85

The following tables show Defense skill, displayed AC, and
the results of attacks on the characters.  All reported
attacks are by "a fire beetle" a L2 warrior-type mob that
scores 1 to 6 damage on a sucessful hit.

Armored results:
Def     AC        Hit    Miss   Hit%   Dmg/Hit   Dmg/Atk
----   --------   ----   ----   ----   -------   -------
20     201         480    617   43.8     1.47      0.64
1..3   154..160    650    177   78.6     1.90      1.49

Naked results:
Def     AC        Hit    Miss   Hit%   Dmg/Hit   Dmg/Atk
----   --------   ----   ----   ----   -------   -------
20      59         296    404   42.3     3.64      1.54
0..5    10...21    387    104   78.8     4.23      3.34

As you can see, there is no substantial change in hit%
between naked and armored for equal/similar Defense skill.
There appears to be a significant reduction in Dmg/Hit
associated with increased Defense skill.  And there is a
very large decrease in Dmg/Hit shown when the character
dons armor.

Comparing the Armored Def (1..3) results to the Naked
Def (20) results is especially instructive.  In light
of this I see no value at all in comparing displayed
AC between two characters unless their Defense skill
is near identical.  It's pretty clear that displayed AC
is pure eye-candy and does not enter into combat
calculations.

Below is a further breakdown of the Naked results for
low Defense skill.  You will see here a noticeable
decrease in Dmg/Hit associated with a relatively small
increase in Defense skill.  Note that the difference is
very close to 1/2 the difference between Defense (0..2)
and Defense (20).  Although seeing half of the change
in Dmg/Hit ocur over a fairly small portion of the skill
is not inconsistent with the many reports of large changes
in effectiveness when moving through "sweet spots" in
various areas of the game mechanics, the relatively small
samples (248 and 243 attacks in the two groups) keep me
from giving too much weight to this given the notorious
streakiness of the EQ random number generator.  Still,
I find that interpretation of these numbers far more
believeable than the conspiracy theorists "level" mantra
(I simply cannot imagine what they think Defense skill
does, to keep bleating about "level", especially when I
know of no indication from Verant or other informed
sources ever that level per se affects passive melee
defense).

Broken-down Naked results for Defense (0..5):
Def     AC        Hit    Miss   Hit%   Dmg/Hit   Dmg/Atk
----   --------   ----   ----   ----   -------   -------
3..5    17...21    191     57   77.0     4.05      3.12
0..2    10...14    196     47   80.7     4.41      3.56
