I want to thank everyone who added info to my MM query.  All went ok.  It
was a good thing I invited a friend I used to be guilded with since he
brought several friends.  What I thought was going to be a group of 6, maybe
8 turned into 16 people of all classes and races it seemed, all here to help
ME get my drums!
We hacked our way in.  We hacked our way around.  We only lost one person in
the castle, and that was right off.  She was also new to there.
Trains weren't an issue due to our numbers, and mobs were going down so fast
I hardly had a chance to do more than play chorus and cantana for the
casters.
We killed the mob that drops the drums but she didn't have them.  She didn't
spawn again either.  Is she a long spawn?
Didn't get my drums but had fun.

Off to work with 3 hours of sleep under my belt *whimper*,
Sean...
