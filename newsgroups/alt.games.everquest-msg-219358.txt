Enjoy? Not particularly. A better word would be "appreciate." I
appreciate the RSD-inducing upper levels the way I appreciate the
possibility of character death on raids. I don't enjoy dying on raids,
but I'm glad the possibility is there. Otherwise, the game wouldn't be
very interesting.

I appreciate that some effort is required to skill up. Otherwise,
everyone would be a GM.
