Not sure, its been long time... it would more help if you posted a
magelo. There may be some easy cheap upgrades.

If you can get it.. Nobles camp in HHK was always a good one.

Oh... DL then. Skele camp inside the pyramid at the far end of DL was
always a good one. I could get my necro a level or so a night there up
until 49 solo, about an hour a yellow. I know its not blow your mind
power-leveling.. but if two-boxing in the open should be an easy camp.

That's the nice part about the skele camp.. there are like 6-7 inside
it at any one time if pulling singles, and they don't social agro on a
spell cast.
