The best heuristic I've seen:

Religion teaches you how to be in the world, while a cult tries to take 
you out of the world. A religion gives its members guidance and support 
in how to survive and get along out in the world. Cults always try to 
isolate their members from the world. Cults want their members to live 
together, usually in isolation, and break off all contact with friends 
or family who aren't also members of the cult.

----

There are some faiths that I personally consider quite cult-like that do 
not fall within the above heuristic, but *every* 'faith' that does fall 
within it I do consider a cult.

More vague is the notion that religions provide people with a framework 
of beleifs on which to build their lives, while cults systematically 
build "extreme" dependancy and reliance on the cult, usually on the cult 
leader. FWIW Catholiscm may look to the Pope for leadership and 
guidance... but not to the degree that I am trying to convey by 'extreme 
dependancy and reliance'. You'll also note that there is nothing in most 
pagan, druidic, or wiccan traditions that trigger these heuristics.

I know nothing about Jehovah's Witnesses to say whether they'd trigger 
them, but what I do know about Scientology suggests the 2nd... if it 
qualifies as a religion/cult at all.
