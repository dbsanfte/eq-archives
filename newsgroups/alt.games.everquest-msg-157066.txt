>Anyone else remember some EQ "firsts" for them?

My first character had no maps, no knowledge of allakazham or this newsgroup,
no understanding of /loc.  And of course it was before you "repopped fully
dressed".
At around level 5 or 6 my Surefall Ranger had been playing in Qeynos after a
kindly guy in a robe took me there and "bound" me. I had never seen anything
but bugs, skeletons and these ugly wolf / dog creatures called Gnolls.  
I got lost one day and accidentally zoned into this huge plains area... very
flat and only a couple of guard towers and no one helpful.  I spent forEVER
there - mainly running from HUGE BUGS as I recall.  Finally I came upon a farm
house with... YES!!! human beings.  I was SO relieved!!  I ran over to them as
fast as I could, sure that they would help me find my way home.  I didn't even
get to hail them before I got the "BAM you've been killed by a bandit". 
Loading... please wait....
I lost my first leather tunic that day that I had saved and paid for all by
myself... and it was a long time til I trusted ANYONE that looked like a
regular person.
(But I'm over it now.  Really I am).
Second biggest shock was when I made my first "world tour", (the long way, on
foot and by boat), and found that THEY KILLED BEARS IN THE COMMONLANDS!!!!  It
was an awesome journey though, all my "stuff" safely in the bank in case I got
killed again.  I met some very kind people along the way....
