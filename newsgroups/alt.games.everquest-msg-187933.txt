    Ok im thinking it... nope can't work it out. Either 53+ only get ported
out when naggy spawns or when they use an ordinary zone in, or they get
ported out every few mins and can be constantly CotHed back? How's it work?
:)

    I was nearly on a naggy raid once and like most 52 people (i'd guess)
have seriously considered staying at 52 until I've been on at least one
naggy or vox raid. However, if its possible at higher levels... hm...... but
is it cheating? I guess I'll have to think about that. :/
