OMG! OMG!!! Top posting!! grab yer flamethrowers of mighty retribution!!

Sorry, I just saw a silly thread elsewhere that yet again degenerated into a 
battle of words of the relative merits of posting in top or bottom, instead 
of just talking with each other about the original post. When I saw this top 
post I just couldn't resist. Speaking of which, using Outlook now I realize 
my default is to top post!!! Somebody help me! How do I fix this stupid 
program? Don't be bothered... I will go fix it myself right now... hehe.
