Did you say something, "bob" <dlv88@comcast.net>?

All robes are just a handful of different patterns with a colored
overlay, the same way all plate is the same plate texture but with a
different color overlay. The dyes let you determine the color of this
overlay for a given slot, but the shade of what you wear in that slot
will be different if it is leather, chain, plate or any given robe.
The BCS is a flowing black robe texture with a blue/green overlay, so
the white dye gives you a black robe with red and purple details.
Similarly, the siren scale robe is a kedge robe with a blue overlay,
so the white dye gives you whatever the kedge robe looks like.

Basically, as a robe wearer, if you want to be white, you have to get
a robe without any details, which is white in the basic texture. I
recommend lucy for looking up what your robe will look like;
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=25603 is the entry for
blackened crystalline robe. You'll want robes where the appearance tag
is 'plain robe' in order to be white.
