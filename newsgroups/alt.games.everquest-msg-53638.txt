Yup...exp is slow...get used to it....unless you have someone powerleveling
you...which I think is no fun.

Move into EC for better exp...or try N Ro.

Do not fight greens unless you are after some item they carry...I find that
high blues get the fastest exp with the lowest downtime.

My advice on training points is to save them for Research unless you take up
a trade.
