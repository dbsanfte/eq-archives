You're at the evolution point at 29.  Bedlam + DS is the strategy for
sub-20s casters, and sub-30s melees.  Above that, a better strategy is to
have the enchanter kill the mob 99.9% and then blur.  You can do mobs that
give the max possible exp that way and leveling goes quick.  That strategy
can take you into the 50s easily.

Animations are rough in this strategy due to their general stubbornness. 
Being able to back off your pet before a blur is good.
