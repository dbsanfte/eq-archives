actually if the "staff" were to check the log. an error message is issued as
to (%T) being under the world, and the loc, in the case of it happening to a
player, the program "moves" (teleports abruptly) the player to a different,
and assumedly safe location, also reporting loc of the destination.

pushed? i am assuming you mean along the lines of bash or stun or some other
means i am not of a level to have experienced, but regardless the frequency
ratio is a bit lopsided.

Mana, yes i know they do have a limit, and enhanced mana regen, but it is
WAYYYY outside their respective levels in MOST cases being my concern.
