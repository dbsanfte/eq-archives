Ok, this is more of a "what can you tell me about X", but a little
explanation first.  I have a vah shir bst alt that is levelling up as a
no-twink, loads of fun (she's my "I don't want to talk to anyone, go away"
alt), but because she's been providing gads of swirling shadows and
leather padding free to my husband, I figure she's earned the right ot
have Foxeye buy her one piece of nice armor when she hits 30.  (It's
amazing how nice her armor is already from finding stuff cheap on vendors
and looting left overs from Hollowshade Moor wars.)  I was planning on
nathsar leggings, because they had the "naked graphic", and I think female
cats in panties are adorable.  But I just discovered today that *gasp*
they changed nathsar leggings back to leather!  THE BASTARDS!

So, err, I have to find another option.  For the short term, I think
feathered leggings (4ac 7sta) will give "the look", but my beastlord
deserves better.  I found two options, and I'd like thoughts/advice on
these.

1) Elusive pantaloons

So-so stats, but could be worse.  According to Allakhazam they drop from
Vas Ren ___ in Scarlet Desert, which are probably green/lb to my ranger.  
I've never even set foot in Scarlet desert.  Does anyone know whether a 59
ranger could solo these mobs?  Any tips on where to pull to, etc? I
haven't seem 'em yet in the bazaar...maybe they are cheap...but it's more
fun to hunt in new zones for drops than spend my money. I'm trying to save
up for a 100k item,so I need all the penny pinching i can muster.

2) Primeval Legs of Madness

Nice mnk/bst/dru/shm legs from spy master I'Kavin in PoH. (16ac 10str
10dex 5sta 5wis 45hp 30mana...recommended level 58, so these might be her
reward when she hits 50 or so). I have to assume they are expensive,
though.  Does anyone know a ballpark of how much?  If these are "so rare
you might as well not try", then of course, I'll forget about 'em.  Got
enough PITA goals right now.

3) What the hell...anyone know any other beastlord useable naked-graphic
legs that aren't awful awful stats that I have missed?
