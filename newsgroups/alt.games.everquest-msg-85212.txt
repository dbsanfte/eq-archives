Well I saw the repage so here goes....

Yes, actually the name doesnt actually owe anything specific to Pterry,
beyond the offering to him of a place in the Heavenly Vault of the
Literature Gods that is due His Celestial Humorousness in the normal
course of life.

The guild started originally on Torvonnilous and had a core of about 20
players or so from Cambridge and the second round of Ipswich...all East
Anglia and we're moderately weird, and Wyrd is more fantasy game so the
guild became Wyrd Angles, its has been suggested that we are not Wyrd but
merely Obtuse, this of course is an acute observation and the guild is
largely equilateral on what pun we should base ourselves upon. 

When AB opened the majority of players chose to movelog and we restarted
the guild there. It went from a stagnating guild of 10 regulars to a
thriving community virtually overnight pulling in mainly Brits but a
number of continentals and US peeps. I think we have others from other
timezones as well.

In short we're aiming to be about fun and community. 

We have not yet got sufficient high level characters to describe ourselves
as UBER, though members of the guild have been seen out on plane
raids. A couple of characters have left to pursue high level play in a
more suited guild...they have all left amicably, and with good wishes from
the rest of us. Hopefully as the guild matures then they wont feel it
necessary to go, but until we can support their play we aint gonna huff if
someone wants something we cant give in the guild, just so long as they
enjoyed their time with us.

THe guild website is wyrdangles.moonfruit.com and the guild charter from
formation is there. The guild is listed on www.guildmagic.com as well so
you can get an idea of the spread of characters we hold....and our
weaknesses.

There is an ezboard we use as our message board linked off the moonfruit
sit., there are some possibly useful demographics visible in the Polls
topics as well as some fairly pointless polls..but its a free access
webboard...fortunately there is money in the community chest so we dont
get popups galore on the guild message board.

Recruiting Officer is Daerneik; if you email him at daerneik@ady.net
you should be able to get a membership policy statement....I know he wrote
one....

Anyone online should be able to point you at an officer as well.
