Hi there, I'm kinda new still and thought I'd mention, when you go to PoK,
if it gets real slow or laggy, try using the top-down perspective, which is
mapped to F9 by default. It took me a while to figure that out, and now I
can move through PoK without lag. I sometimes will hit F9 BEFORE zoning in,
just in case.
Hope that helps,
Uuvai
