You wont make that much money with baking. To do it

Buy a spit and 7 large bags.

Buy stacks of BatWings from EC vendor and combine them in spit with Frosting
from EC vendor till trivial. then purchase fish from Freeport docks and
combine with jug of sauces till trivial, then back to ec for more batwings,
combine with fish to make fish rolls until trivial. No go back to combining
fish and suace and sell the results to vendor providing you cha is 115 or
above you will make a profit and also have an aching wrist

Fishing is a cheap skill to learn and makes a little profit.
