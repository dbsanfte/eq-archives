Of course not. Encounter balance and tuning is just as important as class 
balance in any scenario. Of all the complicated encounter scripts the EQ 
designers have created, it still just boggles my mind that they mostly 
revolve around the basic tank/heal/slow philosophy.

I just don't like the archetype system. I never have, mainly because no one 
has been able to implement it in a way that provides adequate delineation 
of skills and identity between all the various sub-classes. It just feels 
like the archetype approach offers little benefit beyond being primarily 
just a major convenience for the developers in tuning encounters.
