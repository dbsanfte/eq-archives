    To people who have the sort of gear to grind that XP out that fast, and
the time to spend, sure. But not for people who are levelling up a first
character, who would go on a Fear raid for the armour drops. How long did it
take most folks in your guild to level up from 52 to 55 the FIRST time they
did it? Try not to use arguments involving uber items being easier to
purchase now, as the items these folks would sell to BUY better gear have
been devalued all to hell and gone.

    Doesn't take a full set of armour. Even a handful of pieces can make a
marked improvement in a character, assuming they aren't the "gimp pieces"
every planar armour set has (cleric bracers, anyone?)

    So you're claiming that 12 people in pre-planar gear, levels 46 to 52,
can farm Kael Arena? And that furthermore these folks would WANT to farm
Kael Arena and force themselves to kill other specific mobs to fix that
faction should they ever decide to go to Giant faction?

    I agree with you in general - there are a LOT of options out there for
specific slots on specific classes that make Fear/Hate armour look like
junk. But for a lot of the slots, that planar raid is the best thing you
could do - and it comes faction-free.

    Historically, this was the progression: get top pre-Kunark gear, which
allows you to get Fear/Hate armour, which allows you to get Kunark armour
and weapons, which allows you to get Veeshan's Peak weapons and epic
weapons, which allows you to get PoG/Thurg armour, which allows you to get
Kael/Skyshrine armour, which allows you to get Sleeper's weapons, which
allows you to do the top boss mobs of Velious. That has been the standard
path up for top guilds. So, given a level 46-50'ish guild TODAY, what
progression would you advise them to follow?
