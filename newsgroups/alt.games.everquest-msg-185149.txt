I have been playing most of my EQ life on Quellious but have started a
Warrior on the Prexus server that I realy am enjoying. Question is I am
kinda in the dark as to the guild reputations on Prexus and was wondering if
anyone had a link to some informational sites on guilds. Guild Magic have
very basic information. Was just wondering if there were any others.

Thanks,
