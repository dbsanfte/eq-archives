I was in a leveling group last night, and was doing the most damage BY
FAR, of anyone in the group. Probably more damage than the other 5
members put together in fact. Tank would pull 3 or 4 mobs, and my
pillar AE would just rip them mobs to shit. I was consistently doing
3000+ dmg, for 300 mana. I was dropping the non-engaged mobs faster
than the tank could have meleed down a single pull.

When we go on plane raids, the group with the wizards is known as the
exp group. The group of wizards consistently gets the kill, no matter
how many tanks are beating on the mob.

In order to shine, wizards need to get a chance to use AE. The AE
spells are fucking uber. A wizard is pretty much wasted in a single
pull, heavy melee group.
