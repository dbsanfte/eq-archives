I have the linksys also.  The problem I find with the linksys is when
you need heavy band with ie. zoneing or porting.  If you playing a few
characters on the same network  I go link dead with all of them when I
try to port or zone all the characters.  I am not sure if Verant does
something in the program with the ports when moving to other zones.  

Everything seems fine with heavy surfing so I can not put my finger on
it. BUT I might go and get an SMC.

What model SMC do you have?
