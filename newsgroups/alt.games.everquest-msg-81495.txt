A few months back, they put a video on the EQ website.  It was two gorgeous
women in a bar talking about EQ.  It was hilariously funny, because it
looked like the people writing the ad copy had limited their research to
reading the back of the game box.  The video was pulled within a day or so.

I think this is part of the same ad campaign.
