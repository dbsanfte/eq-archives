What the hell were you hunting in Najena???? If your ranger would have
that much trouble, I can only think of one mob.... the widowmistress.
Aside from that, where would the downtime come from on your ranger in
Najena? My 51 warrior was in there for a few hours Saturday morning
gathering twink items for my necro and had almost zero downtime until
that spider bitch ganked me. And I didn't even have any bandages with
me! I realize that your ranger probably doesn't have quite my number of
hit points or AC, but you've got self buffing and healing spells to make
up for that. You should be able to wipe that zone out with your ranger
(widowmistress excepted) with no trouble at all.
