General reply to all of you... Thank you for the info...  :o)  I still think
it will be quite sometime before I attempt to enter The Hole...  LOL

Although...  This begs the question...  Now that I have finally reached
level 30 and my partner is level 28 Warrior, do any of you have any
suggestions where we might be able to fight, get xp, and not have to have a
full group?

We've been kicking around Stonebrunt to do the Wak quest, we did it only
with the help of another higher level Ranger who was nice enough to supply
us with Panda claws and more, but now that we each have a Wak, the zone
holds no real interest for a duo like us atm because the blue stuff seems to
always be surrounded by a) Green stuff that aggrows or b) Yellow and Red
stuff that kills us dead.  LOL

My partner is considering Iceclad, but I think we're a little low for that
unless we get a group up....

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance!
