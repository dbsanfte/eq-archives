Lepidus: Warriors are a group that has been very vocal about problems with 
their class. Are there any plans to give special attention to the needs of 
this class or any other?

Alan VanCouvering: We will be hosting a chat to discuss the changes we have 
in mind on November 24th. We will be doing something more than a just 
simple balancing pass. It's more of a melee combat system change. The goal 
is to make melee combat more interesting over all, to introduce a little 
more skill into the way a melee character is played, and to achieve the 
balance that we are always looking for.
