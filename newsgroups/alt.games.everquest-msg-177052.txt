Well the cleric is not set in stone at the moment but it's a very good
chance we're going to need one. I have thought about some of the posts
here and from various forums, and pulled some of the experience I had
with the game (I am a 3 year vet but I haven't played in years so my
knowledge is a tad outdated and old school). We're going to be doing
everything ourselves for the most part. The exceptions being some of
the Luclin and PoP areas. Our ultimate goal is eventually doing Hate
and Fear with just us 4 (our play time is severely limited so old
school Planes will be a big break for us). They have never done it
before (they are all new), but I have done one group Fear and Hate
breaks myself. I have an idea what group I'm going to need, but I
don't know how much has changed since I left. I know this chnages the
question somewhat. That's why I'm asking around. :)
