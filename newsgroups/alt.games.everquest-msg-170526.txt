Even before that, it's fairly easy to read.  I use it on Eiri, and she's 
just turned 25, and it certainly is *not* maxed yet.

Loc is for when I want to get to a specific place.  SH is for when I 
want to make sure I'm not going in circles - I can do that a LOT in the 
Karanas ><  Used together, they're damned useful - IE, I always overshot 
the SK gnoll spires with Nova, even using loc, until one day when I died 
there, I did a 'locate corpse' from the bridge, discovered which 
direction to run in, and the next time I ran, used loc to course-correct 
a bit whenever I went too far one way.
