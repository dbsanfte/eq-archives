  This may be surprising to you, but the people who are responsible for
developing the game aren't necessarily the same people who are responsible
for handling customer service matters, or allocating resources.  Perhaps
you've heard of staff members refer to the "dev team" and the "CS team" and
the "techs."  Also, just because you're brilliant at game design, doesn't
necessarily mean you're so good at handling customer relations... Absor
himself has said as much.

  The fact is, their failure to notify us about the boats being broken is an
act of incompetence, and there's really no excuse for it... and this sort of
thing happens pretty often.  Verant has a track record of knowing about
bugs, but making no effort to notify their customers or staff members about
them until the patch that finally fixes them, and meanwhile, their customers
spend hours and days trying to troubleshoot the problem, or end up getting
their items eaten by a quest NPC that are broken, or spend an hour waiting
on a boat that doesn't exist.  In this particular area, they DO exhibit
incompetence, or at very least a lack of consideration, and even many VI
staff members will tell you that they have quite a bit of room for
improvement in this area.

  I mean, no one here is even arguing with me.  Only three people here have
exhibited what you might call a contrary opinion, but none of you are
attacking my criticism of Verant as much as you're attacking the attitude of
those of us who are criticising Verant.  Yeah, a lot of people get really
beligerant and do get a bit too free with words like "incompetence" (and
less flattering terms), but when nobody is willing to step up and respond to
an anecdote about how bad CS wasted a paying customers time with an actual
justification for their action (or inaction, as the case may be), I think
that is a clue that big words like "incompetence" might be applicable.
