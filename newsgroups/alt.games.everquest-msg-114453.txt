I generally don't put people on /ignore, because if they're idiots,
I want to be able to hear them coming.  For example, there's one
persistent spawn-stealer/train-starter character that I've been
running across for over a year (and was victimized again by
just two nights ago).  Luckily, she's a mouthy broad, and by
announcing her presence in the zone, I was able to take some
preventative measures before the trains came through.  If I'd
had her on /ignore, I'd have been caught off guard.

I suggest a new "list" command, which works similar to
/friend and /ignore.  If it were up to me, I'd name
it "/shitlist".

Ideally, it would raise an alert whenever one of the
people on your "/shitlist" appeared in the zone you
were currently in.
