Hmmm, what part of Oregon were you driving in?  It certainly wasn't the
Portland area.  What's worse, every year the drivers in Oregon forget that
a long spell of dry sunny weather (yes, we have it here from late July
through mid-October) followed by a little rain creates very *VERY* slick
roads.(*)  No less than 3 fatal accidents the morning of the 6th between
here (Portland) and my dad's place in Neskowin (on the coast).  We won't
even mention Portland drivers and a little bit of snow ......... it's
embarassing.
