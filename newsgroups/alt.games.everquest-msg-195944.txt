At high levels it's quite scary what an Enchanter or Shaman can
"tank".  The Enchanter will use AA/spell Runes to give themselves at
least 1500 HPs of a buffer before the real HPs get eaten into while
the Shaman can use AA or spell based root and Quiescence or Torpor to
self heal over time while someone else taunts off them.

One Supernal Elixir from the Cleric or similar small heal is enough
to top either up completely even through a few resisted slows.
