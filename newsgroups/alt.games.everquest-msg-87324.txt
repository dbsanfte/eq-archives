Warrior, Shaman, Cleric and Bard.

Ok, that's a combo that's worked well for me, but what the heck...

Warrior does damage and absorbs damage.  Period.
Shaman does all the groovy shit shaman can do.  He can be a tank,
slow, haste and back-up healer.
Cleric heals and stuns with the might (snort) DD thrown in from time
to time - unless you go after undead.
Bard - fills in any gaps and backup damage dealer.  Snare, mana and
heal songs, haste and AC, crowd control, etc.

Just my take on this one, you will see MANY other ideas.  With 4 folks
you have pretty good flexibility so don't lose too much sleep over it.
=)
