The thing that bugs me about it, is even riposting an attack will cancel it.

I had to run through DL one time when Gore was up (the dragon, she hates
me).. I figured scale of wolf and I'd be good.. I passed the tunnel and was
about half way between the portal and KC, when a spider came and whacked
me.. I riposted his hit, and of course it canceled scale o' wolf.  bs imo..
i made no attempt to hit the spider.
