Hmmm, an Australian guildmate of mine mentioned that there wasn an
undersea cable cut that is affecting ISPs in Australia.  Is it
possible that your connectivity to the US is poor enough now to be
making it impossible to connect?
I would recommend trying to connect to the Test Server, by running the
Test Everquest Icon, it will download a few files first, but if you're
able to download the files, it means that you at least can connect to
the patch server.  If you can connect to Test, then try connecting to
servers hosted at the two different Verant sites.  I know that
Innoruuk and Sullon Zek are at different locations, so I would
recommend testing against those.  Unless you're unable to connect to
any of them (and don't forget to try and create a charcter if you can
get to the character select screen), it's still worth troubleshooting
further.  If you can't even get to the character select screen on any
server, it's time to give up I think.
