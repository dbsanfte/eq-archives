Exactly.  So, assuming I've never played everquest before and haven't read 
a review, do I automatically assume EQ2 is like "Without Remorse", or, 
given that it has a 2 in the title, and that might be significant, do I 
assume it's like "The Two Towers"?  Speaking -only- for myself, I have a 
tendency toward the second bias.

}But games are different, EQ and EQ2 are Very different games with very

}full story of Norath with out having to look it up.

Aye, and how will I know how different they are when I've never played 
or read up on either and walk into Electronics Boutique looking for a 
game?

}Why were the kerans sent to the moon.

As I recall, Nathyn Illuminatus, who is secretly that Katta guy, led them 
there to escape the colapse of the Combine Empire.

}How was the hole created.

An earth-shattering KABOOM! That came about in a war between the Erudites 
and either the Kerrans or the Heretics, can't remember.  Vaguely 
Hiroshima-like story though.

}Why was Highpass Hold built.

So there'd be somewhere other than Oasis to group in your late teens early 
20's. 

}Who Built the Druid rings ( and please don't say Druids)

Dunno.

}Who built the Wizzard Spires.

Combine Empire.

}Whats the deal with the Iskars and Sarnaks.

Both created by the Shissar, they've been taking turns enslaving each 
other for eons.

}How about Vah Shir and the Grimmlings.

They're KoS to each other.  It sounds like mostly a territorial dispute.

}And why does killing spiders in DL affect your Mistmore faction.

Well, I'd imagine Mayong created the drachlings or something.  But 
associating Drow and Driders just doesn't seem very suprising somehow.

}Who was Najena and why was she bannish.

Got me there.

}Why did Karnors fall.

VenrillSathir went mad, or something like that.

}Why is Burning Woods burning

Because it's not in Eastern Wastes this week.

}Some of those are simple but I'm willing to bet you'll have to look
}them up. So please don't try and bring story into a EQ discusion.
}Most don't care.

That's what I get without looking.  How'd I do?  The thing you miss is, 
that the game is sort of like a side effect of the story.  If you change 
the storyline, the game will be different, and you will know it, I will 
know it, we all will know it.  It's sort of like how I can tell I'm in 
Illinois and not California without knowing the details of either state's 
history in depth.

}Brother, most people Install EQ and boot it up and start killing.
}I got to get to lvl 60 and be Uber.
}And they have no idea there is a story and don't care about story just
}stuff.

I suspect that you may be right.  And that has always disappointed me.  
There's so much else to do in this game...

}But I'm getting off track. It's basically proven market research that
}consumers like new technology. If this wasn't the case we still would
}be fawning over our 386DX PC's.( wow a Math co-processor)
}Just because you like something doesn't mean the kid next to you likes
}it.

True, I don't disagree with you that new technology has a wide appeal.  
But even of just the custmers who go in and see two boxes on the shelf, a 
certain fraction are going to be like me, and get Starcraft even though 
Brood War is already out, or Diablo even though Diablo II is right there 
in a huge display.  Still haven't even tried Diablo II, but I'm playing 
Diablo again. :)

It occurs to me... there's another very good reason I do that.  When the 
sequel comes out, it usually sells for $50, which I consider a large sum 
for a game I don't even know if I like.  But the first one is usually 
sitting right there or over in the sale bin for a mere ten shekels.  I'll 
gladly pay that to find out if I like it.  And if I do, by the time I get 
done with it, the sequel will probably also be down to ten shekels. :)

This is especially true in this case, since EQ has apparently reached the 
status of shareware, as we're seeing in another thread.  "Here's a free 
account key, here's where to download the game, if you like it, after a 
month you can start paying us $13 a month for it."

That could be profitable for a long time.  That could draw in a whole 
bunch of people who just want to try it and get hooked.  And could lead a 
lot of those already hooked to start second or third accounts...

}But you even say "  I will have asked a friend or read a review, and
}that may infulence my purchase in one direction or the other."
}So you might acutally go to EQ2 if a friend tells you it's better than
}EQ.

No, actually, I can almost guarantee I'll never try EQ2.  Not because I 
think it will suck or anything, just because after the way EQ has totally 
occupied my life, I'm -not- signing up for another addiction.  Period.

But if EQ2 -had- been out, and if I'd known more about what the game was 
like, I'm pretty sure I would have gotten the one that a larger fraction 
of my friends were playing.  As it s, I screwed that up, and ended up on 
different servers from them all.  So I had to make new friends.  Oh, the 
agony. :)
