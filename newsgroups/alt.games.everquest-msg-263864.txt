Apparently, it can be hard to recognize an authentic British accent.  I
remember reading some Brits on some forum who were surprised when they read
that Jane Leeves (Daphne on "Frasier") was the highest paid British actress
that year--because they had thought she was an American trying to fake a
British accent.

(Although to be fair to them...she is from a different area of England than
Daphne is supposed to be from, and the accents are different between those
two areas, so basically what we have there is a Brit trying to do a
different British accent).
