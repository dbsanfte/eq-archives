My opinion;

New humans, yukk (dropped my Human SK as they look so bad)
New Erudites look like freaks, one of the most impressive looking characters
is possibly now the worst
New Iksar, not so bad but have lost some of the leaness and now look more
cute and less fierce because of it.
Barbarians, oh well, If you wanted to play Conan now you can, personally I
liked the idea of the Barbarians being Celts. The hands on hips pose makes
me laugh everytime.
Elves, thankfully, aren't too bad off. faces have suffered a little but
things could be worse.
Halflings, hmmm, prefered the old male, prefer the new female (stick crafted
boots on female halfee warrior and her feet turn gunmetal grey, you can
still see he toes, lol)
Dwarves are better wasn't a bad model before but the new ones look great.
Trolls, Look better but not so imposing, could be bigger IMO.
Ogres, Good size, poor detail. Giant Babies with fangs (I think someone here
said) The old ogre was great, there was nothing so disgusting in the game as
when a female ogre did the dance emote :ï¿½)

The new armour is a definite improvement (althought the best looking armour
on any of my characters is the Fine Steel plate on my Bard <shrug>) At least
in the armour respects I don't have a bad word to say about it (well maybe
the new DE female helm, looks silly without the little horns) but in
everything else I think DAoC is better looking. Still, it isn't really looks
that count which is why I still play EQ and not DAoC.

Before anyone suggests I should turn the human model off then I wouldn't
have to see it, yes I could but now I have seen it I know he looks like the
village, inbred, idiot and know that's what most others will see, sorry, he
had to go.
