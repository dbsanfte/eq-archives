KEI isn't at all needed, all it does is reduce down time; at no point in
several runs into various tier one POP zones have I been even close to OOM, and
my mana pool is a shallow one, 126 mana and no more than 300 mana in gear.
Contrary to what you may have heard, though, Size does matter... a 300 point
heal, regardless of how efficient or inefficient it is, can be woefully
inadequate to the task.   At 51 I'll get a heal twice as large and perhaps I'll
stop griping for awhile.

I did an entire level in a POJ exit group, sometimes as sole healer, sometimes
with a backup (ranger with same size heal as me!) and at one very welcome
stretch, as backup healer with a cleric main healer.  Being allowed to simply
slow and keep debuffs up, heck, even slap in some DD when the mana looked good,
thats Living!  I'll note, by the way, that I started that camp with KEI -and-
POTG, had C2 for some of it, and did a good stretch of it with no mana boost at
all; at no point was there more than a 30 second wait for me to get mana back,
and even that was on multiple pulls; successful single pulls were never a
problem insofar as mana regen goes; give me an outdoor zone so I can be on a
mount, let me canni and stoicism myself all I want, and its hard to really pull
my mana bar down much.
