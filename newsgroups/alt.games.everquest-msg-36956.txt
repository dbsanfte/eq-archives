Because if people have been playing the game for a reasonably long
time, then it must be because they get some kind of enjoyment out of
the game.  Now, this is supposition, the game designers wanted people
playing the game for a long time, or one would think considering the
subscription based model.  So to get people to play for a long time
they would try to make the game enjoyable so people wouldn't become
bored or frustrated with the game.  Considering that number of people
that have been playing the game well over a year, it's safe to say
that the game designers succeeded in their goal.  Since this isn't an
easy task (examples AO and AC, neither of which seems to have the draw
or retention rate of EQ) it is safe to assume that the game designers
for EQ are relatively intelligent.  Or at least intelligent enough to
succeed where others have failed.
