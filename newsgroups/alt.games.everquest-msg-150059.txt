You're reading more into the events than I wrote.  He
didn't spawn the dragon "into the midst of the folks who
were there to help", everyone was already in position.  Except
for me (at the spawn point) and the Druid (at the trigger NPC),
everyone else was hiding back in the tunnel.

As I thought I made pretty clear, the dragon ended up
"in the midst of the folks" because the enchanter sat
to mem a spell, not knowing the dragon had just been
triggered, so Faydedar ran from his spawn point over
to where the enchanter (and thus everyone else) were.

Again, I don't know where you got that, but it wasn't from
my account.  The Druid *was* the raid leader.  And no one
gave him "explicit instructions" not to trigger the mob.
His biggest mistake was merely not getting affirmation
from everyone that they were ready.

To be fair, two people had told him to go ahead and trigger
the dragon already.  And no one had told him *not* to, because
even though we were still doing last minute preparations, we
presumed we didn't have to give a "not yet" call as long as
we hadn't signaled "all ready".

It was just poor communication, nothing more.  Lord knows
that happens often enough in this game.  And although
it could have been done better, obviously, I don't lay
any blame.  It was a comedy of errors.

The only true lapse was the Rogue not moving the mob as
repeatedly (and frantically) requested.

It would have been nice to win, but the consolation is
that the spectacular failures make for more entertaining
stories.  :-)
