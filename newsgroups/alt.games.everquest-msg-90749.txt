Warriors do have some probs, it's true. High level casters can camp and solo
the Ice Giants in EF for pp, wizards can TL for cash, druids can port,
clerics can make a fortune with rezzing. But the Warrior has one distinct
advantage, tons of hp and AC. When a caster gets aggroed, they can quickly
die in the confusion, low AC and hp, seen it happen a dozen times. Sometimes
a mob just wont taunt, or the caster hits the PEEL key but lag prevents the
melees from seing it until it's too late. Lost count of the number of times
I've fled to zone in KC, sometimes without SoW, and made cos of my AC making
em miss, and hp absorbing the dmg when they do hit.
From what I've seen the Uber loot mostly drops in places where no-one can
solo. So all classes need each other in those places, for a stable balanced
group.
Most casters seem quite grateful to watch my char get beat on, coz it would
over pretty if I was not there.
