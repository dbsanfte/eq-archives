Yeah thats what i did, start a druid, doing very well with him so far.
Although im only at level 36 with my wizard and not experienced manaburn 
i just like there is no point anymore to wizards.
I think verant have got themselves in a muddle with wizards.
The problem is there lots of other classes who can cast reasonable 
spells AND do something else too, with wizards all they have ever had 
was powerful magic, they cant melee, no pets and so on.
Now that verant plan to destroy wizards i can imagine they probaly wont 
even add them to eq 2.
i think wizards have been the biggest challenge for them to balance.
After playing my druid to level 22 i have to say im shocked druids have 
survived without a nerf.
Snare is the most twinky spell ive ever seen, i have had a saying since 
level 1 with my druid, if its snared it died.
Im level 22 and have yet to die with my druid its been that easy.
