I think Stark was talking about the part how mage pets always hit the mezzed
mobs breaking the mezz.
Can't remember how many time it took me to learn how to use the pet to back
off before the mob dies and to use /assist.

I guess it really matters if the mage knows how to use the pet; if not...
enchanters really hate us.  :)

a few have put me on their no breeze lists already..hehe..

Later and stay safe.
