 I have been pondering that lately. I hardly visit Kael anymore and if I
needed to run through I could always just train if I had to. The only
benefit of being on Giant faction would be for Belt of Dwarfslaying.
Other than that I see no reason to stay Giant alligned.

 Well I haven't been keeping track lately, but the last I read was that
WF was not an alternative to the epic, meaning you couldn't use the
Whistling Fists as a substitute for the Robe. I haven't decided if
that's a good thing or not, yet. Personally I think it should be since
it would probably reduce a bit of competition for
Raster/Pawbuster/Betrayer.
