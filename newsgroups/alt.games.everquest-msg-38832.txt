Lot's of other folks have already pointed that you seem to have missed
the humor of the original post, so I won't do that.

Others have mention the possible lack of humor on your part, so I won't
do that either.

Since it's already been done.  I refuse to jump on the band wagon with the others.

However, I will run along side the wagon, pointing out what they're doing.
