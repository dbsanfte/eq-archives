There's a relatively low level wizard spell (29ish?) O'Keil's Levity.
(Yeah, you have to love the SOE people naming stuff). It's a levitation
spell that lasts for over an hour, gives you a +30 or something large
like that to FR, an unfortunate 5 pt. Damage Shield, and something else.
Kind of a poor man's DMF or SoE.  That's a pretty good spell,
particularly with the FR and lasting that long. If it doesn't wind up
getting overwritten by Circle of Seasons, this will be in most of my
raid lineup spells.

Sadly, as with most things wizardly, it's self only.

For sale in PoK.

Also a much higher level one called Elemental Cloak with some good
resists, but I seem to recall already reading that it get's overwritten
by about everything.
