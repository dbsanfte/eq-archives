    We have a druid in our guild that would claim otherwise. The usual
story - went to PoG, got no faction messages at any point, was KOS
afterwards. It seems to have happened to enough druids that I wonder if one
of the following isn't true:

(1) All druids are too engaged in cyber /tells to notice if they take
faction hits.
(2) If a mob is "sufficiently far" away, then even if you're on the hate
list you don't get the faction message. If the druid cast a buff on a KOS
person while PoGs were attacking a raid group on the other side of the
plane, for example, he'd be added to the hate list and never know.
(3) If a mob takes sufficiently long to kill, it re-assesses its hate list
and doesn't give a visible faction message even though it does change the
normal factions. PoGs are frequently offtanked, and a raid on the far side
of the plane could take a long time to get around to killing them.
