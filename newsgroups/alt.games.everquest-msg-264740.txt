   Might be my way of having a mid-life crises?  Cheaper than getting a red
sports car and newer model boyfriend.  Or maybe playing a cleric on EQLive
was bringing out the Pollyanna in me, and now I am reverting to my true
evil self.

   I dunno about that.  After all, patches are generally adding to a game
that one has already bought.  One doesn't general pay for patches (though
one might argue that some of the expansions *cough*GoD*cough* were little
more than glorified patches, at least as far as the under 50 crowd goes.)  

   I still maintain that if I pay fifty bucks for a game, it ought to be
playable.  Not bug free, not lag free, but at least I should be able to
muddle through.  Now, if someone come in and writes fifty posts about how
much EQII sucks because they killed three rats and never got the Infected
whisker of Fortitude so quests are broken, then ya, I might be inclined to
wish that they would shut up, also.

    Thanks!  Actually, I sorta like those kind of posts myself.  I remember
when ever there was a patch, it would seem like there would be some bozo or
the other in here demanding that Verant give back their money for the time
the servers were down.  Good times.

   Maybe you should have some hot chocolate.  Chocolate makes everything
better.  And if it doesn't, well, at least you still have chocolate!
