Yeah, that's all more or less correct. :) Though at 52/53 (just dinged last
night.. haven't played with level much), I'm noticing that light blues are
VERY easy to solo. Generally speaking, a light blue con will do less than
20% of my health during the fight, and rarely any more than 25%. Reduced
downtime from fighting real blues by doing light blues is definitely good.
;) The way I look at it is this: Take what you can get, 50+. :)
