The first time I heard of this sword was on a raid - a guildie had one & let
me borrow it.  I brought the quest up on my other comp and decided right
then that either the quest, the weapon or both would be nerfed hard and
soon.  It was just too powerful for the effort/risk.  I ran out the next day
and got one.  Verant ran out the NEXT day and nerfed the crap out of future
quest drops.

I'm just glad they're not big on retro-nerfing items.  Sure, they do it, but
not often.  ;-)
