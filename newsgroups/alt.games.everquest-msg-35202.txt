Hi All,

I am a level 30 wizard and have a problem regarding specialization.  Is
there anyway to see what level my specialization is for each skill?

My problem is this - I'm sure I have only specialized in Evocation but I
can't progress beond 50, at my level I should be able to go up to 200 -
right?  The only thing I can think is that I have trained in another skill
that reached 50 first.  But when I look at my skills the only other
specialzation that I have is Abjure (30).  All others are free to train in -
so I guess this means that I haven't developed those specialization skills
yet.  Evocation cost 7gp to train but if I try to pay I am told I am at my
limit of that specialization.

If the worst comes to worst and another specialization has reached 50 first
I have heard of a quest I can do to remove my specializtions.  Can this
quest be achived at my level?

Any help would be much appreciated,

Thanks,

Lex
