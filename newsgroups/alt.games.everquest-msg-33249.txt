Einhorst and Ulrich McMannus at the Barbarian village in West Karana
drop medium bronze like it's going out of style. They are frequently
camped by level 30-something necros who would probably be glad to 
pawn it off. However, there is a Barbarian(!) merchant right down 
the river who will buy it from them so they aren't likely to hold
onto it for long unless you make arrangements.

Of course if you're a roleplayer you might blanch at the idea of
buying from Barbarian killers...
