I'm curious, why the extra crowd control? It's the furthest thing from
my mind if I'm forming up a (normal) LDoN group. Give me a good solid
tank to pull and keep the mobs bunched up for Tigir's and the rest of
the group is pretty irrelevant. I'll take good players I know from
whatever class and we'll make it work easily. 

I'm also starting to think that DPS is overrated. The worst DPS group
I've ever been in for LDoN; 2 shaman, 3 paladins and SK (in Mir with
almost no undead) really wasn't noticeably slower to finish than the
most uber DPS group. What that group lacked in DPS, it made up in
pulling speed since it could easily handle 6 mobs at a time.  

Does anyone really care if it takes you 50 instead of 40 minutes to
finish a LDoN? Especially if you didn't waste 20 minutes trying to
form the perfect group. 

Just to comment on the original question posted in this thread. While
I've usually held out for a good bard to pull if we're gonna do LDoN
hard, we did one last night with a monk pulling and a decidedly
non-uber group of friends (shaman, cleric, druid, monk, bst, pally). 

I think we got lucky in that we had a Mir collect with almost no
casters but the monk's pulling there was flawless.  Single pulls with
almost no downtime in between, just a few instances where he had to
work on a feign split and we had to wait. We ended up finishing in
just under an hour. 

Rgds, Frank
