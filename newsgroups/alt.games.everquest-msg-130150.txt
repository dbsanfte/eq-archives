You sure it's a P3 450? Or maybe a P2 450? You didn't say how much RAM 
you have so I'll PRESUME at least 256. If you are then stop right there 
and install Win98SE or (ugh ME). XP is a resource HOG.

If you've gone back to WIN98 or ME you shouldn't have a problem with the 
TNT (generally) using the MS drivers. If you have, first thing I'd try 
is downloading Nvidias reference drivers and giving them a go. Either 
way you'll probably get about the same performace (is the ATI 64 or 32 
meg?) HTH
