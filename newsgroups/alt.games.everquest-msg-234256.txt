Inspired by the racent "Six Warriors" thread:

  How do the different classes stack up in, say, single-class
groups? All other things being equal (level, equipment, AA's,
race, etc.), how fast do the classes pile up the bodies, and 
against what type of mobs?

  Melees I expect to be at the low end of the scale. I can
see rotating pull duty so that main tank duty is on a different
player each time, and mobs will, if chosen well, drop before they 
can take off 50% of the MT-of-the-moment's hit points. Then the MT 
can bandage up while the rest of the party continues to fight.
Everyone stays at around 50% of max hp until they get their First
Aid AA's, but they can work that way. But slowly, single-pulling.

  Pure casters - well, consider a wizard team: One roots, another 
snares, then there's a countdown:"Begin casting nuke on my mark...
5....4...3...2...1...FIRE!" Again with well-chosen mobs, you can 
single-kill, and the kills are much faster than melee fights.
Wizards fastest, then clerics. Unless the mobs are undead, then the 
clerics pull even on mana efficiency.

  Six druids? Stack 6 of any dot, you can take things down that
would con red to any one of the team. Deep red. At 51, you can handle
Elysians in a reasonable amount of time, with no downtime for mana
regen.

  Pet classes, on principle, should own. Beastlords will
have a fast pull cycle; mages faster, due to their higher damage output
using nukes in addition to their pets. Necros will be even with
mages against 100% living mobs; as the percentage of undead in their
diet grows they will pull well ahead of all other classes.

  And then there is the prospect of 6 bards a-swarming...
