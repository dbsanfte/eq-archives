Precisely, because it's only lucrative if only a few people do it.

It won't make them special, it will make them useless. The whole point 
of artisans is that there are fewer artisans than there are consumers of 
their products. If everybody could craft everything for themselves, 
where would the market be?

For what it's worth, my highest tradeskill is Fishing (200) followed by 
Pottery (120), so it's not like I'm defending my own turf here.
