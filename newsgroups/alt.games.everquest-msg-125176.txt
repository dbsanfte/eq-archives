    If I've been hunting a while, I might have hundreds of small coins
(copper and silver). That gets heavy fast. What some players will do is act
as a "banker" and offer to trade, say, 10 plat for 108 gold with someone
that's getting overloaded with gold. The player with gold can stay in the
field hunting longer, and the person trading the plat gets 8 gold profit.
Sometimes enterprising players will go to a zone where fine steel weapons
drop, and offer to buy them at 2 to 3 plat each. Same deal - the buyer sells
them to vendors for a profit, and the people hunting can stay in the zone
longer before having to go sell.
