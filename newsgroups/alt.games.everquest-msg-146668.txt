There are multiple kinds of mods, and are probably taken differently.

From what I've seen, based on limited testing, parsing, and general
hearsay:

Tradeskill mods:
Extensive testing on eqtraders leads to the assumption that mods do NOT
stack. I believe (can't find cite) that VI have stated (fan fair?) that
mods do not stack. Unsubstantiated, so take that as you will.

Skill mods:
Like dodge, 1hs, etc. Almost impossible to test. Maybe a rogue with
multiple backstab mods could parse max backstabs? I dunno. Nice to think
they would stack, but guessing they probably won't

Caster focus effect mods:
Don't stack.


The other question is whether mods can take you over your class skill
cap, and/or whether they can take you over the global 252/255 cap for
tradeskills/skills. Again, tough to prove, but eqtraders testing on
+tradeskill mods at 252, and casters testing on +med mods at max
meditate, seems to indicate they do not put you over the cap.

Kind of useless that the Grandmaster tradeskill trophies have a
+tradeskill mod, yet they're intended for people maxed in that skill
already, making the mod completely useless. Either way, the mod is
negated by the dirt cheap and commonly available Geerlocks anyway
