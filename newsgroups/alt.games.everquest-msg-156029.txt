I assume this was at your back the whole time?

I may be wrong, but monks aren't supposed to tank, are they? At least
not mobs like that one, anyway? Seems to me that, although they still
may have some tweaking to do, it is coming more in line with the way
it should be. The monk pulls (FD facilitates pulling remaining one of
your specialties) and the warrior or other plate class picks up aggro
and tanks (Ranger too? Hmm...another discussion maybe).

If you are not extremely good at monking, as you appear to be, you
*shouldn't* be able to pull a mob that uber, should you?

Just my 2cp worth.
