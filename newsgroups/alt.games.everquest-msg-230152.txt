	I've been trying to level up a new alt or two in the last 
few days, and I've run into something that's a real PIA.  In at least
two of the zones I tried to work in, Misty Thicket and Marus Seru, there
was a high level player busily slaughtering the guards.  In Misty a bard
killed the wall guards as fast as they spawned, making it necessary to
zone to POK to escape goblin and orc trains.  And (get this) a troll SK
had the entrance building from NL to MS camped, and when I ran through
with a train of zelniaks spent the next 10 minutes chewing me out in
tells for...training him!  Reported me to the GM, reported me to his guild,
told me how he'd fix me for starting this, and so on... He was of the
opinion that since I knew he was killing guards I had no business running 
to that particular zone line.

	The guard killing I've mostly seen up until now was people
invising into a town and killing the "interior" guards, not people
camping newbie zones and making life difficult for young chars...  Am
I wrong in considering this, well, UNconsiderate?  Or is this a
commonplace thing I've just missed before?  Frankly I think it kinda sucks.
