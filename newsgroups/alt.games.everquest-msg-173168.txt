Is there anywhere I can get diamond, Blue diamond, & Jacinth drops charm
soloing as a 54 enchanter?  I'm extremely strapped for cash, and I want
to make my jewelcraft trophy, besides which I prefer to go out and get
stuff myself.  I've already got some black saphires, I just need the
other ones.

I tried going to sebilis this morning but there was only a warrior there
and a separate group of a shaman and a paladin, the shaman was just
pling the pally so I couldn't join them, and the warrior didn't want to
do anything without a healer.

Thanks.
