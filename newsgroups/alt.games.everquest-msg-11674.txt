Hey, if Tirra brings the parts, can someone just hit the combine button
for some Wu's armor? My tailoring just hit 50, and the poof rate is just
terrible. I want to dress my favorite Monk- Jakys- and I'm not doing too
good. How much should a master tailor charge me for his hitting the
combine button? Would someone be willing?
