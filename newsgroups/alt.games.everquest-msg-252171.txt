I can't resist.

Its organized so much better than any other site I've seen.

I mean, the Lucy that everyone always crows about is Filled with 
information in a "WTFIT"format, its basically raw data with no 
explanations.  I'm sure people with a head for this sort of thing can 
translate it in their sleep and won't even have a clue what I'm 
referring to, but personally, I only go there when I'm really confused 
about something, and to date I think its helped clear things up exactly 
never.

Now I do have to admit that looking at Castersrealm for spell data 
simply because I can understand it there is a lot like looking for a 
quarter I lost in the back of an alley out on the main street because 
the light is better over here... but old habits die hard, and a few 
years ago Castersrealm was undeniably the best resource I'd ever found. 
  Sad that its fallen so far.

Splendid
