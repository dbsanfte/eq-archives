More or less. Although, I think making a post that simply reads "test"
is a waste no matter where it is. Why not test by, you know, actually
contributing to the newsgroup? Copy it to notepad if you're that
worried about it, that way you can copy-paste it to try again if your
"test post" fails... But it's not like there are many usenet servers
that are unreliable enough that test posts are even necessary. *shrug*
