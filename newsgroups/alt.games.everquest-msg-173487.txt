I've done the same thing, but didn't pay attention to the relative levels of the
mobs I was working with; with three or four mobs that hit that hard chasing me
around, I'm in "controlled panic" mode and not looking at little details.  It
wasn't till writing this post that it occured to me that relative level might be
a solution to the question.  If I can charm white and under then this opens up a
lot of new pets as I level up.

A hard cap of 55 is limiting, but not all that onerous, there are indeed quite a
few 55 and under mobs in zones up to at least POS/POV, and I've heard they exist
in BOT as well.  My cleric isn't doing any charming, of course, so I have no
direct experience with these issues.

I actually prefer to use charm as CC in groups, versus mez.  If they are trying
to hit my charmed pet, well, no harm done, they can't break charm no matter how
hard they work.  On the other hand, if they are screwing up on mezed targets,
this can be bad news.  Also, the charmed pets add DPS, while a mezed target just
sits there.  A charmed caster can be particularly useful, expending his mana on
his hapless mates while my group is all immune to it; I only wish we weren't
immune to pets attempts to heal or buff us; I'd particularly love those guys
that can cast SOW indoors to hook me up.  Too, once the mob is charmed I can go
back to contributing to the group normally, no need to keep mez in the cycle, I
just have to be sure I can swap back to the pet whenever charm breaks and
recharm or mez (target mob much closer to death, charm might not be worth it
anymore)

In a moderate overpull, I mez all adds.  In a massive overpull, I'm back to
charm, though, as a way to control even more mobs; get a pet and have him tank
mez as many as possible while dancing bard mez on any more that I can juggle;
I've controlled (using the word in the same sense as a controlled skid) as many
as seven mobs this way in chardok, while everyone screamed Evac at the
unannounced AFK druid... we killed off an eleven mob train while he stood there
looking on.

Oh, another stupid charm trick I just discovered; charm a pet type mob and invis
and the mob will poof instantly.  Not sure how universal this is, or if the
pets' master needs to be dead, when I tried it the rest of the train was already
dead, I'd accidentally charmed a pet instead of a real mob, hid to break charm
so we could finish it off... and poof, gone.  More experimentation in order.
Most pets I'm encountering now are so low level that the mana free charm would
do the trick, so I might end up memming both.
