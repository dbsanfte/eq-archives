Certainly it would be nice if they fixed this problem, but in the
meantime, the primary purpose of the GMs is to help people with issues
caused by bugs and violations of the rules of the game (which includes
things that, unlike ninja looting, cannot be coded around). Ninja
looting is something of a bug, and certainly against the rules, and
therefore is precisely one of those things a GM should help with.

The best solution would be to add something like a /permitloot
a_player_01 command that lets a_player_01 loot the corpse you're
targeting if you have loot rights, and keeping the corpse locked until
maybe a minute or two is left on the loot timer (so people can loot
abandoned corpses that the people with loot rights don't want to
loot). Or so I think, anyway.
