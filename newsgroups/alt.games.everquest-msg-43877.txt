The problem is that 2H weapons blow monkey muffins for damage output.
You're talking about damn near 40 to 60% *LESS* damage from 2H weapons
of similar "calibre".

Arm a monk with a pair of primal/priceless warhammers.
Then arm him with a primal brawl stick.  Log the results, I can
garantee you the brawl stick damage output will absolutely suck.

Maybe after they've bumped the ratio of 2Hers in the game up this may
be different, but right now 2H == shit damage.

Oh fuck no!
Slam increases the amount of movement of the mob.
Mob placement is one of the most critical aspects of killing ubers,
push a dragon up a flag pole and you're almost garanteed to lose.
