*Shrug* Print out all the spell lists.

Another thing you can print out off a website.

The ink and paper used to print out all the information that you'd
find in that little Prima guide is trivial cost compared to the price
of the guide itself.

Also note that, as others have said, there have been HORRIBLE
inaccuracies in the Prima guide.

Personal preferrence, I guess, but I don't see any point in throwing
money away on something that I could get for almost free. A printer
and a little web searching will save you lots of money and ensure that
your information is up to date, not to mention more in-depth than you
would get out of the book.
