Hello,

Been lurking for a few days. I'm pretty new to the EQ thing and I've 
just gotten my 1st character (A Half-Elf Rogue) to level 12.

I would like to play a casting class but they seem quite a bit more 
complicated to play than a melee class.

My question then is, what casting class would you recommend playing 
first? As I mentioned, I'm new to EQ and most struggle with the 
interface and keeping up with the action and information.

Many thanks for any tips or help you might be able to provide. I have to 
admit that reading this group has made me seriously doubt whether I'll 
have the ability to play at the high levels of this game. It seems, 
frankly, out of my depth. Oh well, guess I'll just plug ahead and see 
how I do.
