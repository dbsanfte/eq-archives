Ben, you really should consider putting down the pitchfork and dousing the
torch.

The right wing frothing of the mouth makes it very hard for anyone to take
your stance on the subject seriously.  You come off sounding like a man with
a vendetta instead of someone capable of intelligent debate on the subject.

We had a good conversation going (which you seem to have abandoned), so I
know you have the ability to discuss it rationally.  Deep-six the
passive/aggresive road rage.  I'm happy for you that you're passionate on
the subject ... but then again the Heaven's Gate folks were passionate about
their comet, too.  Passion can be taken to too much of an extreme.
