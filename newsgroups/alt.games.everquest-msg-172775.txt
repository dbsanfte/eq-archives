how i did it:
1) looked up the format of the links (something like a byte with value 12,
then 6 numbers, then some text, then another 12 byte)
2) snagged magelo update to get the item ids of my items
3) used some editor (i forget which, honestly) to edit my hotkey files and
stick the links in 'em.

i couldn't find the item ids or anything in my logfiles, but i may not have
done whatever it is that makes the raw stuff show up.

hope that helps.
