Predictably enough, I disagree. Player progression would 
certainly be slower, no question about it, but it wouldn't be 
much slower than it was back in '99. And, no matter what the 
economy is like, those who put in 80 hours a week progress faster 
than those who put in 5. There is nothing to be done about that, 
as it's not a bad thing. Time and ability should be the defining 
variables for player progress, not real-life cash.
