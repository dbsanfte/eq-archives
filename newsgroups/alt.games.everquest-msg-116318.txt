You think you would get it?  That's what it seems like you are implying.
Hard for me to believe, but if you get it then it was obviously NOT
unreasonable.  But I think you know already that that would not be
reasonable and you  would not get it.  What makes you think that if porters
can turn down pocket lint that you can demand infinite payment for rez?  Or
are you just trying to impress or threaten us?  I won't say there's plenty
of clerics, but there's enough that you cannot intimidate the community with
threats of no rez.  Go ahead an hold your breath.
