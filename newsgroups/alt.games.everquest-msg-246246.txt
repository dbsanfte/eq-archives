I just started looking into my macro setup for the first time and have been 
trying to figure out a way to set one to target a group member, and heal 
them.  I am a Pally so I am usually the main tank or assisting tank.  I 
want to be able to heal other party members quickly in emergency (mainly 
the casters).  

Here is a idea of what i have been trying.

Line1: /target group #
Line2: /pause 1
Line3: /cast 1

Anyone ever tried anything like this and made it work?
