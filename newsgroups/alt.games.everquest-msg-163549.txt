	But they should have been.

	Same reason people climb mountains: because it's there.

	No, you'd have whatever NoDrop toys Rallos Zek drops.  They might not be
better weapons but they'd prove you did it, and the guy LFG in Velk's didn't.

	Yes, since 99% percent of munchkin guild members there would be a lot
fewer of them around if the toys stopped escalating.  This is not a bad thing.
