I can understand what you are trying to say, now. I think you worded it
badly in your first post. Don't worry about the flames, some people here get
het up if you disagree with them or state something they see as wrong
(whether or not it isn't) My rule to this is normally the moment they want
to add an insult into the discussion don't bother replying to. They just
proved themselves not worth the time.

Anyway, what you are saying is (I think) that normally a mid - high level
group (40 - 50) will take an equal level Warrior over an equal level SK when
looking for a Tank. Warriors have more health and are therefore better
tanks..but, if that Warrior is a Dark Elf and that SK is an Ogre, chances
are the Ogre will be better for the job (obviously equipment comes in there
as well)
Before Jim Monk does his Green Grocer spiel again, of course an Ogre Warrior
will have more HP than an Ogre SK (all things equal) but when recruiting for
a pickup group your choices of class are rarely also of the same race.

Any 50th level Ogre or Troll SK's want to post some details about themselves
and I'll compare them with My 50th DE Warrior.

No further comment on the taunt ability, apparently my experience at playing
both SK and Warrior just makes me ignorant.
