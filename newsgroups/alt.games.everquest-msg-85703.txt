I almost never use it either. but have been using it more recently on raids
into ToFs, lvl 4 i think.  I have incredible difficulty in targeting
Shadows, especially when there is more than one of them. Yes I do use f8
aswell as clicking, but still have trouble, so will use AOE Mez as an
alternative. I'd rather not, so any tips on targetting appreciated.

What I could really use is a key that allows you to toggle through mobs that
are close to you, or even better those that are agroed on Tank or even group
as a whole. I haven't been able to find this out so i guess there isn't one?

Cheers

Kev
