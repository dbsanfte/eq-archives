Aye, okay.  But I'm not a cleric, see, so I wouldn't know that.  Nor, for
that matter, have I ever consciously met one.  Actually, that's quite odd,
now I come to think about it...

You'd like to send me a copy, maybe?  Bearing in mind PoP isn't otherwise
worth my while because, as I've mentioned elsewhere, I'm level 13 and likely
to stay there for the forseeable future...

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
