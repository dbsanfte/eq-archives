Took my cleric into that cave, conned a couple things and they bleu and
indifferent (lvl 52) so i advanced further. all i found was lava and some
thing that said it was locked and I didn't have a key. When I started to
leave I got to close to the elemental and the whole area agro'd. Took me
from 2k hp to 5 hp by the time I got a gate off. Looks like a place for easy
xp but no loot (checked it out ltr with my mage).
