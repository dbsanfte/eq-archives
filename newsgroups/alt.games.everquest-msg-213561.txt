Many a time I've been in ToV (used to do small doze farms) and Aary wouldn't
be up, but at least half of nToV was.
And hey, if hes that much of a problem and your desperate enough, just go
train it to vyemm

He's also 40% slowable, which is an unmeasurable difference in his
"gimpness"

But when I did nToV at level 60 in velious gear, that stupid dot hit me
every time.
When I go back at 65 now (rare occasion we do Vulak) its a big if, as to the
dot even landing.
Anyway agro control only needs one person cured, not the whole raid

So put a fuckin BoC on him.  Not sure where I said about using a 55 MA for a
noob guilds ventures into nToV, but if it needed to happen, it would be
done..

Nope, no level 65 buffs at the time.
And all you need to do is survive 1 round of melee, healing covers
everything else.  Trust me, it happened.

There was a similar disbelief when (triton?) used a druid to tank rhag2. I
mean, a druid!  impossible.
We've had a magician tank mini aten and Aten H R, a cleric tank the aten
goos... monk tank idol/AoW

Anybody with more than 2700HP could do it..

Well actually your last email was going on and on about aary and vyemms
melee....
