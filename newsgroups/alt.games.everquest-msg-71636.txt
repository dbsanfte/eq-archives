Yeah, I've reported the director to the Department of Commerce on the grounds of
"false labelling" :-P

Really, although Aragorn and the rest of the Dunedain were called "rangers" and were
experts in tracking, they were closer to an EQ warrior than an EQ ranger, I think If
nothing else, bows are the trademark of a ranger, and Aragorn doesn't knock a single
arrow. Boromir is absolutely nothing like a ranger, for all that he wore mainly
leather and cloth armor: he is the LotR archetype of a Warrior.
