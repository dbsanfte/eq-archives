Hey, I've got the pretty much the same issue.  I got a new computer for 
Christmas and installed EQ and it crashes randomly and often. ACK!  Have 
you tried the things they have on the eqlive website in the knowledge 
base.  They don't work for me maybe they will for you.  IT'S SO 
FRUSTRATING. Maybe if we make this poast big enough people will see it. 
  So I'm looking for help, too hehe.
