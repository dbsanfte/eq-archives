OK, interesting.  Next question: anyone know how they determine who actually
gets these?  I have the option of getting the title, and I canceled my EQ1
account around 10 months ago (and it was on monthly billing, so actually
stopped around 9 months ago).

A friend of mine who cancelled before me by about 6 months does NOT have the
title option.

We are both using the same Station accounts we used for our EQ1
subscriptions.
