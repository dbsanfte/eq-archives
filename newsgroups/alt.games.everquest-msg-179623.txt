I have two machines.  

1. 600Mhz Celeron, 384MB RAM, cheap Pine 64M PCI video (no AGP slot on this 
one) w/ SiS 305 chipset

2. 455 Mhz PII, 384 RAM, ATI Radeon 7500 on an AGP 1x bus

The "slower" 455 PII computer runs EQ much, much better.  The 600 has 
noticable lag in even "easy" zones (forget the bazaar)and the mouse pointer 
moves slowly and jerkily across the screen.  

Now what I want to know is what difference is likely to be the largest 
contributor to this performance difference.

1.  PCI video vs. AGP video

2.  Celeron vs. Pentium (is a 455 Pentium really that much better than a 
600 Celeron?)

3.  cheap video card vs. better ATI card.

4.  something else altogether that I haven't considered.  

Ideas, and opinions appreciated.
