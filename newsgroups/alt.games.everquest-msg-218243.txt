It is possible, but as has been said already, if any of your
instrument skills or singing skill is low for some reason, you may
have problems with missed notes. Having said that, here is how you
would do it:

1. Right click on a blank hotkey
2. Give it an appropriate name. Maybe '123' if you are setting it up
to twist the first three songs in the spell jem window
3. The first line would be: /cast 1
4. The second line would be: pause 30 (this should pause the hotkey
from doing anything for 3 seconds, the casting time of all of our
songs. if this is incorrect, its because i'm not in front of my eq
machine and can't test it)
5. The third line would be: /cast 2
6. The fourth line would be: pause 30
7. The fifth line would be: /cast 3

In case of a missed note however, you would have to wait for the last
song to try to play before pressing the button again if you want to
pick up the twist again.

Instead of setting up my buttons to cast 3 songs at once, I have a
series of hotkeys set up for each of my spell slots, labled Song 1,
Song 2, etc.. up to Song 8. The hotkey setup for each is:

First line: /stopsong
Second line: /cast <# of spell slot>

This way, I only have to press each number once to activate a song.
Much easier than 1,1,2,2,3,3,1,1,etc... Too bad I didn't think to do
this until I was in my late 30's =)
