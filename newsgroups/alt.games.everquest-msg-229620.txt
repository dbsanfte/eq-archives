I think that that is going to be the sweet spot.  L24-L25.  Most
casters will have gotten there next round of spells, and will also be
within a decent level range to snipe off the L6 'fresh meat'.  

I'm sure that some are just playing to see how high they can get, but
I think the people that are serious about the PK aspect may not bother
going much higher than 24.

It'll be interesting to see how it plays out.  It is definetly a new
dynamic in EQ.
