if you hold down the CTRL key and click on a stack of items, you'll
pick up ONE item from the stack.  very handy.

likewise, if you hold down SHIFT, you'll pick up the whole stack.

these also work when buying stackable items from merchants.  hold
down CTRL when you click "buy" to buy one; hold down SHIFT and click
"buy" to buy a whole stack.
