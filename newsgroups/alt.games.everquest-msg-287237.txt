That's exactly what we did. We went. to a competent, professional detective
agency in London, paid them over 400 quid to debug our. house. They used
scanner devices which go to over 1 GHz and would pick up. any nearby
transmitter in that range, they also. checked the phones and found
nothing... but if the tap was at the exchange, then they. wouldn't find
anything, would. they?

CS: >Doesn't this suggest to. you that there are, in fact, no bugs to be found?

You can assume that they've done this sort of thing. to other people in more
"serious" cases, where they would. know the targets would suspect the
presence of electronic. surveillance. So they will have developed techniques
and devices which are not readily detectable either by visual inspection. or
by electronic means. What those techniques might be, I couldn't. guess.

In this case, the existence of bugging devices was clear. from the
beginning, and. they "rubbed it in" with what was said by the boy on the
coach. It was almost as if they. wanted counter-surveillance people to be
called in, who they knew would. fail to detect the bugging devices, causing
loss. of credibility to the other things I would have to say relating to the
harassment.

I did all the things someone in my situation would do. to try to find the
bugs. In addition to calling in professional help. using electronic
counter-surveillance, I. made a close visual inspection of electrical
equipment,. plus any points where audio or video surveillance devices might
have been concealed. Of course, I found nothing. Normal. surveillance
"mini-cameras" are. quite noticeable and require visible supporting
circuitry. It seems to me the best place to put a. small video surveillance
device would be additional to a piece of. electronic equipment such as a TV
or video. It would be necessary. to physically break in to a property to fit
such. a device.
