The first time I went to the Grey, my video card went way crazy. I was
told this had happened to other people and was a known problem. This
was about a month and a half ago.

Since then I have updated my drivers for the card and turned down the
graphics demand as much as possible. My question is this: Will my
current card (NVIDIA GeForce 2 MMX 32 meg) be able to reliably handle
the graphics demands of the Grey? OS is Windows ME if it makes any
difference.

A secondary question is what caused the problem in the first place?
