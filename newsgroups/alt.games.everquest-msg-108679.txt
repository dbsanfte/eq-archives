I think these have got to be the worst few slots for a wizzie to fill (at
least to get INT or mana bonus).  The only one of the three I have filled on
mine is the shoulders slot.  I have a coldain prayer shawl in it.  It is a
NO DROP, quested item.  The first two levels of shawl aren't too hard to do
if you are high enough level -- about 35 or so.  That's all I have so far.
After that, you have to have some solid trade skills to proceed.  So far
there are 7 levels of shawl, where each level has that same number bonus to
AC, INT, WIS, and save vs cold.  The 7th also has flowing thought 1 and
there are (or were) rumors quests would be built to advance the shawl
further still.  Because of this, it seems that one of these shawls may
easily be your best long term shoulders option.

Check out the quests on Allakhazam.
