My pet tanks blue mobs all the time.  Not quite sure where you get that 
idea.  If I pull 2 mobs, and they are not rootable, I sick my pup on one 
while I occupy the other one.  I can easilly keep us both healed up.  Not 
doing that with PoP mobs, they would chew my pup up fast, but plenty of 
other dark blue mobs out there that we can deal with.  Cazic Thule, Ssra 
Temple come to mind off the top of my head.
