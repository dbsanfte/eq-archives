Good points, but since I refuse to buy PoP and do a lot of play in
those zones faction is an issue. I simply hate faction grinding and
will only do the Vel stuff because of HoT and others. 

One thing that is worth mentioning is that humans have only one real
drawback and thats vision. Secondary stats are good and allow you to
concentrate on primaries which you do anyway. 

All in all its just a matter of what you want your char to look like.
