Good move.  But here's what you don't know.
With a bolt spell, you don't have to target ANYTHING.  Just stand on the top
of the stone tower in NK, look toward the wilderness, and cast away.  Cast
until you are out of mana, then med full, and repeat.

Yes you will get skill increases in Channeling, Evocation, and Specilize
Evocation like this.  The only catch, even though your bolt isn't targeting
anything, it has an enourmously long range when dumb fired... and it will
cause damage to things that it actually hits... and they will aggro on you.
So make sure you're up high... and facing in a safe direction.

As for why you're not seeing increases so far... see below.

Yes.

I think I have shot myself in the ass with a bolt spell... but I took to
running right after casting.

What is your spec evocation skill now?
Did you train Spec. Conjuration?
If you didn't put at least 1 point into EACH and EVERY specialization, then
all of them are capped at 50.  So, you probably need to go back to the
training hall, and put a point into Spec Conjuration, to lift the cap on
Spec Evocation.  If this is the case, make sure you go back to bolt casting
until Spec Evocation hits 51 (assuming it is 50 now).

Yes.

No on 1, yes on 2.

> Does anyone here know for sure?

Yes.

PS: Useful Social for this kind of training:
Mem frost bolt in slot 1, and fire bolt in slot 2

Social name: "TRN EVO"
/pause 28, /cast 1
/pause 28, /cast 1
/pause 28, /cast 1
/pause 28, /cast 1
/cast 2

This will cast 4 frost bolts, followed by one fire bolt (to let you know
that you need to hit the button again).  Note: I might have gotten the
lengths of the pauses wrong... they might be 32 instead of 28... if you get
the "you have not recovered, yet" message in this social, then raise the
duration of the pause.
