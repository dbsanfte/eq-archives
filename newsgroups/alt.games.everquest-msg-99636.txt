IF someone disagrees with Ben THEN insult intelligence.

Ignorance is curable. I learned from my mistake.

Stupidity is the inability to learn. Such as the inability to learn from
other people's viewpoints (I don't mean mine only. I mean *anyone* who you
disagree with in this group since this is the standard response from you.)

Or perhaps you never went through that phase in adolescence when the egotism
of the infant (which is characterized by difficulty in seeing the other
person's point of view) is replaced by the egoism of the adolescent (who is
capable of integrating the other's point of view, and who is often highly
sensitive - conforming behaviour, embarrassment at the behaviour of parents
etc)

But I think I think its option C. That you are just an egotisical, arrogant
person. Why, if you are so intelligent, you feel the need to point this out
to most who disagree with you and resort to name calling?

Thankfully many of the a.g.e commmunity, many of the people you insult the
intelligence of, are intelligent enough to know that an opinion is an
opinion. One is not right and one is not wrong. You, the person who claims
that you are comparatively more intelligent than the average bear, are not a
member of this club.
