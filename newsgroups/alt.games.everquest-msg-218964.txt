Whoa, slow down there, it's only the spark of an idea.  It might be
more constructive if you take the spark and see how it might be
fashioned into something workable.  Anyone can destroy, lets try to
create.

In another post I mentioned some ideas that might balance it, like
the buffer and the buffee have to stay in the same zone.  That
pretty much eliminates someone selling the cast in PoK, it also
eliminates someone giving out a few buffs and then going AFK in
the bazaar.

If necessary it could even be limited to groups, as soon as you
disband the spell could poof.

: If you change it so it only lasts as long as the person is
: grouped with you then you drastically alter the shape of raids;
: now a single caster of each class can't share out the buffs over
: the entire raid; thats the opposite of MGB, which most raid
: buffers see as a holy grail of sorts.

Whoa, hold on there!  I didn't suggest *current* spells should be
replaced.  You could have two versions of a spell, one of them
being the regular timed version.

: And when people LD, what
: then, they are dropped from group or raid... now you have the
: nightmare that pet classes have, where they suffer mass loss of
: time every time they LD, only multiplied by every person you are
: trying to keep buffed.

Not a problem if you keep the timed version of spells.  Also when
you disband (regularly or through LD) the spells don't necessarily
need to poof immediately, perhaps they could revert to the timed
sort.

: Add in some way for the caster to turn the buffs off and you
: might have something.

That would probably be a necessary feature, or perhaps just make
them zone to clear the spells (assuming you helped balance the
idea by making them only work while the buffer and buffee are in
the same zone).

: But what exactly?  Well, currently you cast a buff, spending say
: 15% of your mana pool, and it lasts 15 minutes or more.  You med
: that lost mana back in 30 seconds, or perhaps a minute.  So
: really it only cost you a fraction of a % of your mana over the
: 15 minutes.  You'd have to make the mana cost extremely small for
: your version to match up with what we are currently spending.

If SOE ever did something like this, they wouldn't necessarily have
to get it balanced perfect on the first try.  The best approach I
think would be to err on the side of caution, and then improve the
balance in favor of the players until a certain level of usage of
the feature was achieved, then stop.

: Want to see a buff that works this way, though?  Try a bard.  Now
: it would seem their buffs work the reverse of the way you
: suggest; 18 second duration and no mana cost.  But the
: combination means that to keep a given buff on your group, you
: sing it every 18 seconds like clockwork.  Since you can sing at
: most 5 songs this quickly, you are essentially spending 20% of
: your casting potential on each buff you keep going.  Want to keep
: something else up instead, or damage or debuff the mob(s) you are
: fighting?  Drop one of the things you were keeping on the party.

I'm not familiar with bards, that's interesting.  Of course in a
sense it proves my idea isn't totally hopeless!

: Clearly bards do just this, and it can work; but its a very
: different magic system than what any other class is currently
: using.

Yes it is.  As a purely intellectual exercise please help suggest
how this spark of an idea could be made to work.  :)
