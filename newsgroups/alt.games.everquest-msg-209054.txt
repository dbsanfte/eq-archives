Not being disrespectful but I do take issue with a couple of your
points.

Things do break and in ways none of us can imagine. THis is why things
are tested to the extent they can be before release. This was not
done.

This round of problems most certainly could have been prevented. It is
not impossible to improve your product by competent testing. 

I dont know who makes the decisions at SoE but someone is in need of a
royal public ass chewing followed by an equally public appology to the
customers.
