As a different character grouping with necros, I have seen them run
around or instantly fear when they are jumped directly. Good grouping
necros don't do that- they yell for help and have someone pull the mob
off them.

When grouping and enchanter with a necro, ask the necro not to use DoTs.
DoTs ARE the best tool of a necro, but they do not mix with mezzes. This
combo can get the necro and chanter killed very quickly. The only time a
necro should use a DoT is on the primary mob (the first one picked to
die by the main tank).

As a necro, the rest of the advice made a great deal of sense. I've
spent half my existence in groups so far, and it's quite fun.
