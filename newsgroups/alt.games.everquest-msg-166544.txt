I dont' think he's coming off as "conservative" or "liberal". What he's 
saying has absolutely NOTHING to do with that. If anything he's thinking 
"capitalist" or as someone pointed out "feudal". BTW I've never heard of a 
conservative *government*. I've heard of a conservative *party*. And I 
sincerely DOUBT they are "the historically worst". I'd vote for either 
despotism or dictatorship myself.
