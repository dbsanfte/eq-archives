   This whole turn this thread is taking reminds me of the one I got involved
with quite a while ago where Carolynn's Mom was defending calling someone (maybe
me, I forget) a nazi because in her family it was considered a "cute" term.  

   Getting back to the context of this thread, well, the hijacked portion of it
anyways... I have to say that I wouldn't be too thrilled to find out that on of
my guildees was defending Hitler in /shout (no /ooc on FV) in any regard, even
with the standard "Yeah, I know he was evil, but" disclaimers.  The sheer weight
of the cruelty Hitler inflicted on millions of helpless people complete
obliterates any trace of any admiration that any sane or sensitive person should
admit to in a public forum.

   I used to think that Godwin's Law pretty much just applied to cases of
references of Hitler and Nazis being used as an ad hominem fallacy, but this
thread is leading me to believe that even contextual references to these topics
are just as effective in closing down the usefulness of a thread.
