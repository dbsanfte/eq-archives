Bring the resuse time down to one minute and mages are nothing
but rod whores again.  1 min reuse/ 3 charges/ 2750 mana (it
changed from 3250).  If I cast this, then eat my 3 charges before
casting again, and I have  200 spec. Con.  the cost down to cast is
1305.  With KEI, PoTG, Spiritual Purity, and medding full time,
I can *just* get 1500ish mana in 3 minutes.  No mana to maintain burnout
on pet, no mana for nuking, no mana for DS.  Might as well just 
'bot a mage and have done.

Short of eliminating the spell entirely and giving us something
useful in it's place, this is pretty decent.  It gives everyone
on the raid who uses mana 1080 mana to use in a 10minute period
(rod/5min/rod/5min/rod).  The vendor bought replacement gives
mages from 4.3 to 5.4 per tick (depending on gear/aa/spec) net 
mana regen back.

The reason I use 10min instead of 15 is because any fight that
last >15 minutes, thereby requiring a second mass rodding, is 
not likely to be very doable.  I really hope they are tuning
those marathon encounters to the 10-12minute range.
