    Hmm. You had room for an SK in the group? All your clerics have range
foci, then?

    Yes, it does. =)

    !!

    Seven clerics? Wow, now I'm amazed you lost. Our CH chain for Xegony is
five clerics, plus we'll have someone running between offtank and CH that
can do Divine Intervention when required.

    The order in which the waves come is random. There's two waves that
you'll be very happy to see done - once you're past those, about the only
thing that can cost you a win is a MT/CH screwup.

    "Almost"?

    There's a trick to doing tank switches on her, if you need to do them.

    Our necromancers have used Essence Emeralds in the past to keep the CH
team fed. Our first kill, CH was chain-casting for one hour before she died.

    Yaulp Won't Do. The gap in healing will kill the tank. Get them all
cheap drogmors for this fight.

    I hate being on a horse, too. But sometimes you have to summon Elmer (my
horse) and get to it. Gaps in healing will kill the tank - she hits
capital-H Hard.

    It doesn't hurt that the AoE isn't quite working right. ;-)

    Your gear is very nice. Your shoulders *are* the best in the game
outside Time, and you have a very nice focus set. But Monual, you need to
get out of PoM, sit down in Earth, and grind out AA points. You're about 160
points away from having the "essential" AA's for a cleric. The one that
really bugs me is no Healing Adept. How do you expect a tank to last when
your CH isn't a real complete heal? Here's the list of what I think is
pretty much required, which you don't have: MC 1-3, CA 1-3, CS 1-3, ND 1-3,
HA 1-3, HG 2-3, PP 1-5, IE 1-5, AHA 1-3, AHG 1-3, ID 1-5, LR 1-5, RC 2-3, UD
2-3. Even deleting the CA, CS, ID, LR defensive stuff, that's still almost
110 AA points to get done. Just by getting ND and PP/IE you'll get more than
if you stayed the same amount of time in PoM farming that BP. Nose to the
grindstone, lad!
