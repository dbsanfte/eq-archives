LOL, I remember back when people said EQ was a pile of shit game when
it first came out. Broken quests, mad crazy bugs, holes in game play
all over the place. But it's still here.

Never assume something till you give it time. If that was the case EQ
would have never made it.

Personally I think EQ is slowing down, People do get pissed off when
one night you can solo dark blues and the next day you can't even take
on a light blue. And some people not a lot mind you but some have
left.
I know on my server at least 5 strong guilds have called it quits.
But EQ will last at least a couple years more before they call it
quits.
 
Customer Service ( if that's what you can call it) is shit.
Tech Support are idiots, no matter what the problem is they always say
it's your video drivers.
In game support...Hell, I can make a new toon and get him to level 35
before a GM will get to me.

But I still play it. Must be the Masochist in me.
