East karana should make good hunting at your levels, and not overpopulated.
Just set up camp a bit south of the bridge near the water, and pull the mobs
down near the water to fight them... that way you wont get adds. You would
need to bind at high pass or qeynos, which makes for a slight run. NK by the
gypsies is also a bind spot if you are brave.

You could also hunt the chessboard at butcherblock, but that is a more
popular camp.
