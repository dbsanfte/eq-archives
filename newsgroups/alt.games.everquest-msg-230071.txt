/rant on...

I am always leery of the 'guild comes first' mentality. Really, where 
does that get you... it should never be a choice between being a 'part 
of something bigger than yourself and be miserable' or 'having fun'.

Why play if its not fun?

As soon as the guild starts to tell me what to do, what to loot, and 
when to loot it the enjoyment factor drops to zero. If I'm not having 
fun why should I care if the guild is doing well? Because if I'm not 
having fun I'm two short steps from quitting playing... and that will 
suck a lot more out of 'the guild' than missing the odd raid for some 
me-time, or buying an item somebody else thought somebody else should have.

Its not that I am selfish per se; I like helping others, I will go out 
of my way to help people get equipment, flags, corpses etc... I just 
don't like my enjoyment of the game being involuntarily subverted to 
someone elses enjoyment of the game. Or worse... a non-persona 'guild' 
entity.

I've seen guilds nobody seems to enjoy ... from the officers down to the 
recruits, everybody is working for the guild almost as a personal 
sacrifice... and 'the guild' itself as a 'non-entity' certainly isn't 
taking pleasure out of it... they become self perpetuating misery 
factories. At least corporations put bread on the table... if you don't 
enjoy your job, you can always say "Its work, i don't have to like it, 
as long as they pay me."... with a game... if its work, and you don't 
like it...what is the redeeming quality?? In my case I don't let it 
become work by refusing to let anything suck my enjoyment out of it, and 
thus can keep liking it.

If a guild that *claims not to have a loot council* says "You can't 
spend your points on this because its not to the best benefit to the 
guild," my response would be "Keeping guild members happy is the best 
benefit to the guild. If you are going to deny me my earned awards out 
of some notion that I'm not benefitting the guild, I will deguild now, 
and be an object lesson in just how much less I could be benefitting the 
guild."

If 5 more hp, 3 more dex and the odd proc on the MT is worth losing a 
regular, competent player (and probably half his closer friends) to you, 
then I'm happy to do the exchange, because I will never be satisified in 
a guild that thinks the former is worth more to the guild than the latter.

/rant off

At the end of the day I would never really kick up a stink like that. 
But then I would never involve myself in a guild that I had a whisper of 
suspicion would treat its members like that either.

To me a guild is at its best when the members are enjoying it. If that 
means letting some dim bulb buy an item that's not optimal for him... so 
what... we got the item once... we can do it again, and by all agreed 
upon rules we said he could claim it. I would never seek to renege on 
agreed upon loot rules, especially over some vacuous (and hypocritical) 
claim my redistribution was better for the guild. If I'm sowing 
discontent, and undermining the agreed upon terms of engagement then I'm 
doing far more harm to the guild then a piddly sub-optimal item 
allocation ever will.
