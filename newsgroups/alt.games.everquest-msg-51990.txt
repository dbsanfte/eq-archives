Sang,

Nice point here. The difference between ease of soloing and soloability.
Can't agree with you more. So the question is what is the
Sang-sanctioned list for each ?

From what you have said so far I am guessing that on the ease list Druid
is king and on the soloability (I.E. Max output by optimal payer) Necro
is king. I figure that in the top few of both lists Enchanter and Shaman
will feature.

Also It would be nice to see 2 lists, twink vs non-twink. As I am sure
that the addition of regen items etc makes a huge difference.

My guesstimates (For non twinks)

Soloability                    Ease of Soloing
1) Necro                       1) Druid
2) Enchanter                   2) Necro
3) Shaman                      3) Shaman
4) Druid                       4) Mage
5) ?Mage                       5) ?Monk
6) ?Bard                       6) ?Enchanter
