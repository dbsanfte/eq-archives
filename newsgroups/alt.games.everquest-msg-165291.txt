As others have said, in a group your combat skills
generally won't matter.

If you really want to get them up, find an existing
group (with a good tank and preferably already having
a cleric) and ask them if you can practice your melee
skills on their MOBs. Tell them you can also send a
heal their way if there's an emergency.

You won't get any exp, but the group will find their MOBs
going down fractionally faster and have access to an
extra healer in case of emergency. And you can practice
your offence and 1HB. (Even get your 2HB up as well,
since there isn't too much risk.) This is a strategy for
skillups that I've seen a few people use, mostly melee
classes. Of course the melees doing this generally can't
offer the emergency healing angle and are rather more
likely to accidentally KS the group (if its DPS drops for
a while for some reason).

For defence... well, defence is not quite so easy,
unfortunately. For that, something *has* to pound on you.
