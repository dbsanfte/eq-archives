Still can't answer with an intelligent argument can you? You're arrogant
about it too, yet more signs of your ignorance.

I've read up on WW2 and been educated in that particular history. I also
read through a lot of information about Vietnam and Korea thanks, the USA
got their arses handed to them in both wars. I know about black Americans
and I know black Americans that hate being called 'African' just because
they are the colour of their skin. I have read plenty on Afghanistan and the
Al Queda and books with titles like 'Global Network of Terror' and 'Soldiers
of God' do not suggest an objective read that covers both view points and
presents all the facts. I don't need to read propaganda, I try a little
harder to get my information.

I don't know why you are recommending books about the Balkan conflicts to
me, I never tackled that subject but I will if you want to add that to the
argument we are having. I doubt you know much about that one either. Just
because I'm not American, doesn't mean I don't know anything about it. I
have family in America and many friends, and it seems to me that you are the
one in the dark.
