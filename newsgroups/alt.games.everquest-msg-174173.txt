Already you show a misunderstanding of USENET.  A message board is a
central server that messages are posted to and recieved from, a
newsgroup is a collection of servers.  I post a message to mine, it
gets replicated to the others, and people use their server, which is
almost certainly a different server, to read and post replies.  While
from a user standpoint they are quite similar, from an implementation
standpoint they are completely different.

IF you pay attention to RGMW, this does not apply here.  Where it does
apply, it is almost universally due to the poster's primary language
being something other than English.  You should consider when flaming
someones poor English skills, that they may have grown up with a
different language.

Translation- Hey you!  All my self-worth and poorly thought out
opintions are boring you!  You are so superior to me!

Not hard at all to translate.

A bit of an internet history lesson- There are several resons for that
style of writing.  

Firstly, it tends to be more compact than proper english.  That isn't
much of a factor today, but when it was first developed, 300bps modems
and slower were standard.  Every character you could shave off your
messages made a difference.  Think of this aspect of 1337 as primitive
data compression.

Secondly, to an extent, the indecipherable nature of such text is
exactly the point.  Such text generally defeats attempts at automated
content filtering.  This allows people to discuss things that would
normally be blocked by censorware.  Think of it as a low grade
encryption, more secure against computerized decryption than ROT13,
but immediately readable by humans.

Third, to some it is an artistic outlet.  They for some reason prefer
the asthetics of it.  I don't, and find it makes serious discussion
painfully slow.  But, for casual conversation I don't see a problem
with it.  So little emotion is carried through when typing a message
out that little things like replacing certain letters with a similar
number/special character can help convey more than just a literal
meaning to the text.  Think of this as a more complete and flexible
version of the smiley.

Get to know those you insult, only then can you strike out with truly
artful trolling.
