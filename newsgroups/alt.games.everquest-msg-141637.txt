Unfortunately, no one has any rights at all beyond those to the mob(s)
they are currently engaging. Sony/Verant do not recognize camps for
the most part. You have a right to any mobs you can pull on your own.

Having said that, common courtesy would dictate that they let you grab
one now and then when they see you running from hut to hut LFP -
especially since you were there first.

Oh, btw, if the weapon yo gave his pet was some 6 dmg/xx dly piece of
junk, you weren't doing him any favors, and may have actually bugged
him. His pet will hit naturally for better than that. Not having spent
much time with a pet class (other than a chanter and we all know they
don't really count as pets), someone correct me if I'm wrong here.
