I must be old.  The only way I've ever heard "tastes like chicken" used 
is in joking reference when trying some new or unusual item - ie there's 
a restaurant called "Pounders" that lets you make up your own stir fry, 
and some of them have some pretty wild offerings - rattlesnake meat, 
shark meat, alligator meat - and ... yeah.  "Tastes like chicken" is the 
usual joke people use once they've tasted it.

Oh, and I'm Canadian too ;p
