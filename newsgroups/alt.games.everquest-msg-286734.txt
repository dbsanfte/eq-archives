This is true. I frequently employ private detectives to spy on people
(there's a good reason for this and I'll tell you if you guess
correctly) and one such detective showed me the latest technology only
last week. A small rucksack. One strap of the rucksack has a tiny hole
in it that you wouldn't notice unless someone pointed to it. That's the
camera: the wires lead into the rucksack itself where there is a video
tape recorder little bigger than a Walkman. I don't know if that's what
Roger Cook uses but it certainly explains why it is that the subject can
look straight into the lens and not realise (s)he's being filmed. Now, I
say "latest technology" and I think that's the technology that the
police use as well as the retired police who become private detectives,
but no doubt the security services have far more sophisticated
equipment.
