I have been reading this ng for about a month now, and I also peruse a bunch
of different message boards and I have ONE major question.

If you have a problem with the way Sony and Verant run and play Everquest
and you do not enjoy the game and can do nothing but bitch and moan at how
the *Giant Corporation* just pisses on your head and down your back,
destroying all fun you have playing, Why are you still here and playing?

I have heard the same pissing and whining from people that I picked up at
the casino's when they lost their money.  "Damm Indians stole my money."
this is a direct quote from a fare I picked up.  I asked "bad night at the
tables?", he proceeded to tell me he lost $5,000 at blackjack.  I asked
"Well did you at least have a good time?."  He said "No." and Well being who
I am, I told him, "Well Sparky, I may just be a cab driver but if I do
something that costs me $5.00 and I do not like it, I may try another $5.00
to see if it was just me or a bad turn. If I still do not like it, guess
WHAT!!??  I am not going to spend another $4,990 to see if it gets better.
So shut up and stop whining, nobody put a gun to your head to make you play
spend that much cash."
You people who don't like it keep spending you $10.00 a month but continue
to whine,  WHY?

The answer is simple you do not like it move on, or find the joy that is
here in playing with friends and family.
