I've managed to shed that habit, I carry little with me other than fish
rolls (space saver food) Fizzlecutter 5000 (space saver drink) peridot,
pearls, bat wings, fish scales, arrows, and resist gear... open general slot
for Tboots and a second open slot in case I end up with some form of
quest loot, A herbie pack I looted ages ago, and a couple deluxe
sewing kits and three tailored backpacks.  Now I'm going to ditch
one of the backpacks for the box, which will lose me four slots
that have mostly been filled with looted runes words and pages that
noone close to my level cares about any more.  Yes, an EEbag would
be better, but I just don't care enough to camp the bag, or heck,
to camp EC looking for one!
