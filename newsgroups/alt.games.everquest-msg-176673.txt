The CD Keys are permanently attached to your account, which means you could
sell only your account name and password and the buyer (with the sofrtware
on his computer) would get a notice saying that the account had to be
re-activated with a credit card the first time he logged in. Upon doing
that, the buyer would have your account, including any characters
(characters are deleted 3 months or so after an account goes de-activated).
The CDs aren't even needed if the buyer has the software, but the buyer
wouldn't be able to run characters from your account to PoP, even if (s)he
had PoP installed, because the CDs get attached to the account and you don't
have PoP in the Gold edition. CD keys are usually requested from the seller
because even if you sell the account and the new owner changes the password,
the CD key holder can call Sony and GET THE ACCOUNT BACK. This because Sony
does not recognize the sale of an account as valid and considers it a stolen
account.
