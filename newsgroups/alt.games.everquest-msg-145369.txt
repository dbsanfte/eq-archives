I think you will be pleasantly surprised at what happens when you are not
one of them.  When I started my enchanter, I did no twinking, and just went

PoTG, KEI, Aegolism.  Was given several pieces of twink gear, and generally
had a grand old time.  I did not accept anything expensive, wouldn't have
