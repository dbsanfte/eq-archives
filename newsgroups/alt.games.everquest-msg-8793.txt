Hmm.. I'll have to look up the info on Ignite.
Your comment leads me to beleive that Ignite reduces AC as does Flame Lick.

I replaced Burst of Flame with Ignite in my line up.

Also, thanks for the suggestion about Fearing the Grimalkins.. I was
thinking of going back to LoIO and gathering up some cat pelts to have a
Quiver made.

Root is a bit helpful when multiple mobs aggor, but it can't be relied on. I
can rarely cast successfully when I need to make a run for it.
