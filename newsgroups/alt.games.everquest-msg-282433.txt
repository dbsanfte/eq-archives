PK, let me get this right:  So, they *all* read his post, then called
you up, individually (or maybe in desperate groups), and asked - nay,
pleaded! - for you to speak on their behalf, did they?  The *entire*
East Coast and Southeast of the USA mobilised a large proportion of
their over 30's (got to be half a million plus) and summoned you,
their hero, to fight the good fight for them?  My God, you have
totally flipped out of reality!  Here's me thinking you are merely
Captain Faned (sorry, "Feigned") of the Internet Semantics Bureau,
Analogy Division, and in reality you are spokesman for millions of
loyal followers of alt.games.everquest over there in America - Holy
Shit...  And there was me 1) thinking you were just pompous and 2)
that the newsgroup wan't as frequented as it used to be :D

Ah, heroic *and* you are so noble with it, too.  You wanted to let the
matter slide, but with the entire east coast *and* southeast of the
good 'ole USA looking to you, you had to wear your underpants outside
your tights once more...  There's many a presidential candidate would
like that number of loyal followers.

Faned - take more meds, get a life and bugger off mate.  That's the
most hilarious bit of self-delusional crap I have ever seen in Usenet.
