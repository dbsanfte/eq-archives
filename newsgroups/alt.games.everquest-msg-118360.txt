I have NEVER agreed with Biz..........until now.

When i read this father's post I was going to respond, but after reading Biz's
post, I don't need to write a whole message.

To Father:

It is YOUR fault for not knowing what your kids do, get into, or talk to on
the internet.

You have no one to blame but yourself.  Try being a real father that is
involved with your children's daily life.  You can't save your daughters ass
for her whole life.....and you are way behind right now.  I would suggest that
you go visit some of your friend's houses and see hoe they interact with their
children.  I think you will see that you are lacking some parental skills and
should keep the blame, not try to put it on others.
