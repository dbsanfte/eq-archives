The same reason they don't allow the EQ client to run in windowed mode
directly, because they're afraid of people alt-tabbing out to edit the
client's memory.  This is, however, a fairly invalid reason as first, if
people really wanted to hack, they can just get or write a memory editor
that works over a network and edit the memory with a second computer or
alt-tab since it still works on many computers, and second, memory hacks are
dead because hacking anything important that is still client side will get
you banned, and there isn't much left client side anyway.  Verant knows this
and the hackers know this, so hopefully Verant will just allow the client to
run in windowed mode and put an end to the need for EQW.
