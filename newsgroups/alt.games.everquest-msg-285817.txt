Since I always clicked my mounts off in the past when moving (slower 
than Run3, a least when you factored in the steering and acceleration 
things) I never noticed this one:

If you're running a mount and  you step in water, even crossing a 
stream, the mount vanishes instantly.

My plan of leaving lev off while traveling mounted now has its own 
problem, like a vampire I have trouble crossing running water!
