Err... you realize hailing the Loremaster isn't how you get the shawl 
quest?  You hail the Grand Historian, and that starts a script where the 
Loremaster says something like [seek to perfrm duties for the crown], or 
something like that.  But without the brackets, actually, because it's 
Velious.  So probably you finally targetted the Grand Historian by 
mistake. :)
