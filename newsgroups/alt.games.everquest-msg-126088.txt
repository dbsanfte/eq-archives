Almost every low level monk i know/talks to me for advice etc, is
borderline/over weight.

I had many weight problems when I was leveling up, I couldn't afford the
uber 0.1 weight stuff, or multiple tink bags etc... its not the same anymore
at 60 (although I do go overweight when pharming, its not really an issue)

I got mine at level 60 (admittidly it was the very large one, from Lord
Yelinak).. but the only other mobs I've seen that drop them (as ultra rares
too) are high 40's Wyverns - some 60's would struggle to solo them.

When I was pharming them, I ran my twinks through SS to my pull spot so they
could loot the lore stuff, anyway with my level 60 cleric sat there on the
other comp, I decided to fight one with my level 53 troll SK.

Aego, HT, several Cheals, and 10 solid minutes of fighting, the mob wasn't
even below half life... these mobs have almost zero regen too.

So hows a 50 monk going to kill these mobs for a coin purse? :)

agree there.

One thing thats a problem for me though (well it was, paying for rezzes isnt
an issue now) if I took 100pp out the bank to pay a cleric for rezzing me,
and they refused to accept the donation.. I was now screwed with my weight.

Well if you die they are stuck on your corpse.. then what use are they? :)
Being bound in the bazaar means all of these items are easily at hand for me
anyway though... tho I don't think I've ever once bought a coffin.
