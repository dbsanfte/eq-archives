I still play angband, masters of orion , masters of magic....

Good games never really die. The problem is that Eq has always been
primarily eye candy. The game mechanics where pedestrian at best with the
occasional flash of accidental tactics. The game mechanice remind me so much
of rolemaster, 1000 of tables to look up , big hefty dice to roll, and the
end result being a roll of 96-100 ends in a dead mob and anything else go to
the next round of combat. It was however the first eye candy of its type and
thus had the first draw. That was pretty much the only reason it got the
subscriber base it did.

I fully expect EQ2 to have every bit state of the art eyecandy. I expect the
game to be visually stunning .I also expect the game mechanics to be very
diffrent from eq. I however expect exactly the same answers given to some
questions that need to be answered a diffrent way.

I expect that wow will probably win but it is by no means certain. They just
recently added no drop equipment as quest rewards which is probably going to
start down the damn no drop loot path (a mistake of monumental proportions)
. Also many seem to be screaming long and hard for trivial loot code and non
consensual pvp (2 other possible mistakes of monumental proportion). Wow has
very little content I have heard about that requires grouping (the main
mistake in asherons call).

I dont expect to buy Eq2 , I expect that sony is gonna give it to me about a
year after it releases with a free character transfer from eq.
