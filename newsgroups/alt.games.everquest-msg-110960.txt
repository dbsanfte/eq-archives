That doesn't quite apply for necros though, my level 16 necro (whee.. FD is
fun) is essentially my "caster crap I don't feel like selling" mule and I
can say that the difference from him having full cloth armor, that robe off
the Muglwump in the Warrens that some guy let me loot (back before I had my
druid even) and a pair of 2 int rings, as opposed to having a bunch of
cheesy +hp/mana items (frozen mantle, some 5hp gloves off a spider in Lfay,
some 10 mana cloak off the Reishicyben and a few pieces of flayed skin,
we're talking serious crap here) but which add about 100hp and 200 mana, is
very much difference, with necro's hp-> mana ability in coordination with
lifetaps and lifedots (dot lifetap, eg Leach), hp are very important, plus
the fact that I can off-tank with my pet a bit (yeah, I know them robed guys
can't take hits heh)

That said though, I don't even know why I have fear memmed any more on him,
I haven't cast it in 4 levels (fear in dungeon  = bad mojo), I guess I just
had an extra spell slot (now that's a rarity...), I haven't had a chance to
try out the new level 16 spells yet though (except to play with FD and to
buff myself), I would imagine I can chuck fear in favor of one of those.
