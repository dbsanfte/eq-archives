Ask yourself how many people will hold onto a game paying $10.00 a month and
not intend to use it ever again. With Verants new policy lets say I am a
nice guy and let you use my account and you change to password I call Verant
the account is Banned. Break down and buy the collectors version $9.99 and I
believe you still get the first month online free if you don't like it
cancel the account. It's going to take a real moron to let you use his/her
account.
