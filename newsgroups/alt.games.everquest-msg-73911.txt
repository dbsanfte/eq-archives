my 14 enc hasnt used a pet spell since lvl 7, and it took that long for me 
to say "screw pets, stupid bastards" because i used cb belts to level up to 
7... i personally say the best tactic is to tash from max range, run back 
while the spells are recycling, stop, cast root, dot, nuke, nuke, root, dot, 
nuke, nuke, etc... sure, theres downtime, but its easy enough.. btw.. i dont 
think i even have my 8 or 12 pet spells.. and i dont miss them at all...
