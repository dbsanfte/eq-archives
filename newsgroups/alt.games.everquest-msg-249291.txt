I love my gatehammer. It is a worker's sledgemallet, I use it to get a
port out of bad places, if I attack a mob it procs and gates me to
Overthere on top of a boat. If it is a bad mob, I hit counterattack
disc, to ward off the blows, and attack, most of the time I will proc
out and find myself in the Overthere, safe and sound with my Dragoon
buddies.

I will then run off the top of the boat. if I messed up, I used to
fall into the boat and run up the sides without a care. Now, if you
fall in, you are trapped. No running up the sides and warping out of
the boat.

When using your gatehammer, DONT FALL IN THE BOAT!

I have not tried to enter a boat in the water the same way, you used
to warp up and into the boat by swimming up from below. I hope boats
come back. I used to jump off them to get to some of the camps.

New collision engine, new problems.
