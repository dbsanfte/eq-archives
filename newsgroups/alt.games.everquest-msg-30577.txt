Hi,

I just killed Zhal the Vile last night in NK, and I looted
a "Bag of Troll Guts" from his corpse.

As far as I can tell it seems to be a quest item.  I have
looked around a bit on-line, but thus far I have not found
out very many details about the quest.

What I have read suggests it involves a Bard in South Qeynos
and another NPC named Fabian.  But the web site also stated
that the quest was broken, or incomplete, or something.

At any rate, I have not found out much about the quest or
exactly who to give this item to.

Does anyone here have any information on this quest?

Has anyone here completed it?

Many Thanks,

 - Mike Dorr
