Ever since my cat hit "Auto-Attack " while I was talking to my Bard
Guild Leader, I don't think the furry SoB deserves the good stuff.

On the plus side that same cat managed to reprogram my wife's keyboard
and delete the excel document she was working on in about 3 secs :-).
This happened shortly after she complained that I play EQ too much.

On second thought I think I will pick up some premium wet cat food on
the way home tonight. :-)
