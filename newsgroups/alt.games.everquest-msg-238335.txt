Wasn't there somebody here a while ago who claimed another player was
a "kiddie porn stalker"?  This poster claimed he heard this other
player saying some sick things to some other players.  The poster
claimed that he confronted the player and that the other player
allegedly started harassing him in-game after that.  The poster then
posted the alleged pervert's character name and server on the
newsgroup.  

Then the original poster posted a retraction admitting he made the
whole thing up because he and the other player were real-life friends
who had some kind of falling out and that the other player had
supposedly shouted in-zone one night that the poster was a "stalker",
so the poster made the "kiddie porn stalker" post so the other player
would know what it felt like to be called a stalker!
