I'm sorry, you're right.  I didn't mean to say that we should NEVER get
anti-gates.  I'll take 'em.  I'll take any spell that VI want's to give me.

What I meant is that Anti-Gates are NOT the solution to the wizard
undesirability issue.  And that if VI is only going to put in one answer to
this problem, then I would rather have something else, since this sure ain't
going to do it.

And the way they've described them (short duration, long repop... so you'll
have to have more than one wizard) means that unless I'm on an assassination
mission, with my pick of help, and perfectly timed castings... these aren't
even going to be in many wizards' spell books, never mind memmed... since
there are much better uses of mana.

Actually, that's not true... every wizard I know will have them in the spell
book... heh, we're compleatists by nature... I know elves that were looking
all over the place for "Heat Sight."
