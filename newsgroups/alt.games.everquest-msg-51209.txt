Maybe this has been posted before.  But anyway, I am a 25 ranger and
interested in the best 1hs that can be attained at or near my lvl.  I
generally group with a 29SK and 29 druid, but solo is fine as well.
Currently I use PGT and crystaline fiber(nice but not great).  I am thinking
a couple of good 10 dam plusses to str, dex, sta type stuff(haste would be
nice:) ).  What do you think?
Thanks
