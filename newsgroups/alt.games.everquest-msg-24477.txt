Not true.

You can always start a new character in zones near the new 'lowbie' areas. I
started a new character specifically to try my hand in The Warrens (and
soon, Stonebrunt Mts.). I like the fact that these are zones I never
explored as my primary. And with the new loot rules, my lowbie Enchanter has
a better chance of getting some goodies in those zones.
