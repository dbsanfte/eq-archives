The other posters put most of the answer together, but let me summarize it
all in one post. Here's how it works.

You have ONE pool of Adventure points that can be spent at ANY adventure
merchant. There is no such thing as MM points, or EC points, all points
earned at any dungeon contribute to a common pool of points. If you hit
alt-V and then click on the "View Stats" button you'll see one entry called
"Adventure Points Available:" and that shows you your total.

When you want to buy something from one particular camp, you are limited in
what you can *see* (and therefore what you can purchase) by how many of your
adventure points were *earned* at that particular dungeon. The more points
earned at a particular dungeon, the higher up in the list you can see (and
therefore buy) at that camp.

Here's a hypothetical. Suppose you've earned 350ap at MM, 300ap at Tak,
300ap at Ruj, 100ap at Guk and 500ap at EF, and let's say you haven't spent
any of those points ever. So, you have a combined total now of 1550ap. This
is the number that shows up as "Adventure Points Available" when you Alt-V
and "View Stats".

You read on the 'net somewhere that "Incorporeal Chain of the Spectre" sells
for 1492ap at EF. Woohoo! You've got 1550ap so you run over to EF eager to
spend it. Unfortunately, because you've only earned 500 of those at EF, when
you go to the EF merchant you can't even *see* the chain offered, you're
limited to seeing only those items that are 500ap, or just slightly above
that. So you can see items selling for around 650 or 710, for example.
You'll notice that anything above 500ap is greyed out, and items 500ap and
below appear white and selectable. This is because the UI is telling you
that you have enough AP earned at that location to buy a 500ap item, but
nothing higher. They tease you by showing you things that are just out of
your reach in order to make you drool and hesitate and maybe go back and
earn more points.

Despite what many people may erroneously tell you, there is NO WAY for you
to consolidate your points and spend them all at EF to get that chain. You
will never be able to directly see, let alone buy, items substantially above
what you've earned at a particular dungeon. In order to do that you just
have to buckle down and go out and earn the points at that dungeon.

Let's say you go out and earn another 1000ap at EF. Now you have a combined
total of 2550ap, 1500 of them earned at EF. When you now go visit the
adventure merchant at EF you find that you can see *everything* on his list
(because the prices all top out at 1492). You can now buy that chain. You
select it, hit Purchase, confirm, and you now own the Chain and still have
another 1058ap in your pool. Notice that you can *still* see everything on
the list at EF, including the other 1492ap items, even though you only have
1058 to spend and only 8 of those were earned at EF. This is because once
you've exposed items for sale at any merchant and can see them, you will
ALWAYS be able to see them (and therefore buy them), you never lose your
height in the list. Once you've reached the top of the list and can see
everything for sale at a particular merchant, you are said to have
"unlocked" that dungeon. You'll never have to do EF again if you don't want
to. You can go out and earn 80 million ap in Guk and spend it all on
anything offered at EF. That's because your adventure points all go into a
common pool and you've unlocked EF forever.

Now go back to the earlier hypothetical prior to earning the extra 1000ap in
EF. You have a total of 1550ap but only 500 of it earned in EF. You want to
buy that Chain at EF and you know that you have enough AP theoretically, but
you can't even see it offered for sale, so you're out of luck, right? Well,
no. There's a trick you can use to still purchase it. Here's how it works.
This works on FV, where almost nothing is NODROP, I don't know if it works
anywhere else.

Go to any merchant and buy any NON-LORE augmentation. For example, Broken
Cryptstone of Fortitude, 100ap at MM. Buy 15 of them. This will cost you
1500ap. Now find a friend who has "unlocked" EF and give him these augs.
Your friend then can go to the Gnome at the SRo wayfarer's camp and just
give each aug to the gnome. The gnome will say something like "Ok, you
didn't like that, go buy something else" and will "refund" 100ap to your
friend for each aug turned in like this. When your friend is done turning in
all 15 of the augs, he'll wind with 1500ap that he didn't previously have.
He can now go to the merchant in EF and buy the Chain and then give it to
you. Like I said, this works on FV, but I can't verify if it works anywhere
else.

That's pretty much the whole, complicated story on LDoN adventure points.
Let me know if I've left anything out.
