Everyone I've seen transfer servers has found a guild or whatnot to
chip in on re-equipping them as good, if not better, than they were
before. As for keeping the same server...*shrug* What's the
difference? With the transfers, they bounce between servers. Guy A
leaves server C to escape his reputation, Guy B comes over from server
C to escape his. Net result is no change. May's well keep them nailed
down....

Besides, I don't think "soulmark" history travels from server to
server. This is their file of warnings, praises, etc for all the
account's characters on a particular server. It'd be stupid not to
move it with the character, but remember who we're talking about. ><
