Nice for the resists and AC but even a BABS is better for melee at:

Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword    2HS   24/39    2.5 wt

Easy to get, just go into runnyeye and kill all the pickclaw destroyers until
you get one.

Yuck. Dump that veil ASAP. You are a tank you need AC. Get a fine
plate visor at a minimum.

Yes get plat or velium fire opal rings.

That bracer sucks dump it ASAP. You are a tank you need AC.
Kodiak suck to. Get fine steel at least.

Lots of better AC cloaks out there now.

> Feet:  Charred Boots - AC 6, Agi 3, Poison 5, Fire 5

Low AC here you need better.

Pain in the ass quests. Random mobs. You NEED a tracker to do these.
If you don't have a tracker friend, forget it. But they are decent items.
