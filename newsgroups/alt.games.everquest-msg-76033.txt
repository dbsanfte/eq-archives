Well, as usual, I am confused. I just checked on Allakazam and found the FV
forum/discussion, but still feel like I'm standing on a dimly lit porch. Can
anyone tell me what the server is about, or give me a link so I can read all
about it for myself? I would love a RP server, but I would also like to know
what the restrictions are.

TIA
