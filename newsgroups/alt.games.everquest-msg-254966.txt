Woops.  Should have worded that better.  No, it wasn't directed at you.   As
you said, you did your errands before the others got down there anyway.  
Not even apples / oranges on this one...

One thought on this.   I've had several group leaders say to hold buffs until
everyone gets there.  I see the logic of this.  However, Virtue takes a *good*
chunk of mana and I have a *extended enhancement* shield.  I would just as soon
get a few people done while we wait....
