Stop being so damn smug DT. Just because *you're* ok, then everyone with
a problem is causing it themselves because they're intellectually
deficient donkeys running a 386?

Is it their fault?
They programmed it, I have changed nothing except DX8.1, so undoubtablty
it's somethgin they've done.

Are they *at* fault?
For causing *my* problems in isolation, maybe not. You can't test every
single PC combination. What you *CAN* do is test a wider variety of
common systems. 
AMD probelm? Oh yeah, what a rare, obscure piece of outdated equipment
that is.
Memory leak and the ever expanding swap file? Due to my steam powered
mouse no doubt.

Hell, even the 'You do not have luciln installed in the correct
directory' message fires off randomly, totally ignoring whether it
should or shouldn't.

I agree that some online petition is pointless, but so is your 'I'm
alright Jack!' facile comment.
