I'm told its 19 hours, but can skip, so could be 38 or 57 or... well it 
could be a very long time, in theory.

I didn't have a timer as to when he'd last been killed, so I was just 
"winging it"; the zone was empty and I decided to camp out and wait as 
long as it took.

Took 13 hours, as it turns out.
