Oh and while we are compiling our wish lists I'd like my necro to be able to
wear better armour. And why should I have to regenerate mana at
all? What's that about? And why can't I have 100000 hp so I don't have
all that boring time between fights? And why can't I play whatever level I
like? Why have I
got to play through those boring 59 levels first? I just want to win the
game.

Go play quake or something if you don't like this game.
