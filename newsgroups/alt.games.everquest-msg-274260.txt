Well, yes, of course.

I was simply commenting on the fact that if one installs and runs the game
from the original 1999 CD, it won't work.

Sure, you can get a new patcher off the Internet, but you have to know
where to find it, and more than that, you have to know to look for a new
patcher in the first place.
