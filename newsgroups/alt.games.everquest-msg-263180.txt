Here's a repost of something I did in July - I think it's what you're
after:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I stumbled over this little gem a week or so ago. If you're goofy like
me and have got flags in all the wrong order, this thing will help you
sort out who to hail. Basically leads you right through it.

Get it here:
http://home.earthlink.net/~nilesn/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/popflagparser.exe
(yeah, it may wrap)

You'll need the .net framework though. Easiest way to get that is to
head to windowsupdate.com and snag it from the optional list of stuffs
if you don't already have it (I think XP may have anyways?).

Make sure you have logging on. (logs are in your EQ\logs dir)
Now, head over to the Seer and run through "unlock my memories,
beotch" and "guided meditation".
Open your log, hit ctrl-end to get to the end, scroll up and find that
part from the seer - both responses. Copy and paste them to a new txt
file.

Run the app, open that text file you just created, follow the
directions.  It will show you a check list on the right of what you're
flagged for and tell you who needs to be hailed.  Saves a lot of
farting around guessing.

Sounds like hassle, but that's all done in about 2 minutes and then
you're ready to rock! 

I just ran it from a second machine, snagging the logs from my game
machine while I was still in game (mapped drives) to save some time.
