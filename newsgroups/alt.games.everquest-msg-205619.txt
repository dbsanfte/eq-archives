Last night a Monk buddy of mine asked if we could experiment with a few of
his weapon combos to find the best combo. We headed back to the Arena in the
Bazaar and grouped up to see each others HPs and started Meleeing the crap
out of each other (I am a Ranger and did not use spells for the tests).

Suddenly I was hit by a blind spell and with my MR being at 105 was totally
freaked out that it actually landed. When the spell wore off I noticed I was
down to about 8 percent health and headed to the Gate and left the PVP area,
only to find that I sill had "WINGED DEATH" on me and my heals were barely
keeping up with the DOT.

Would I have lost exp from dieing from that DOT? Would it have made a
difference if I was in or out of the Arena if I would have died from the
DOT?

BTW I was fully aware of the risk of getting jumped in the arena, this fact
does not bother me at all. I am just concerned about the death from dot, and
the rules that apply to them.

Dave
