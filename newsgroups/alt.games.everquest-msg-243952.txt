Explore and Group often. Do *not* focus on levelling. Do *not* spend 
more than one level at any camp. Why? So that by level 30 or 40 when 
people start expecting you to exhibit some competence you will have seen 
more than 3 zones, 10 mobs and 1 tactic.

When you group avoid grouping with people higher level than you to much. 
They'll carry all the weight and you'll never learn anything.

Don't seek high level buffs, its a crutch. They're appropriate at high 
levels... at low levels they do all the work for you. Its ok to die... 
you learn where the limits are when you die...you learn how *not to die*.

Sitting in PC with 5 ubertwinks and their mains buffing the crap out of 
you gaining a level every 15 minutes is not teaching you squat, and 
you'll walk away from it 20 levels higher and not one whit wiser.
