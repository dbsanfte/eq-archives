Just to add a bit to the others who pointed out how Taunt works...
You can have a successful Taunt and not be attacked at all.  There
are situational modifiers to aggro selection that can and will
cause mobs to attack somebody other than the person atop the list:
- proximity (affect varies somewhat, undead mobs in particular
love to whack wheever's nearest)
- sitting (low level mobs mostly ignore sitting, some high level
mobs detest sitting more than anything except low health)
- low health (mobs just can't resist a chanceto finish off some
poor sap who's near dead)
- root (mobs will go with strict proximity when rooted)
- pets (mobs always prefer whacking a PCs to a pets)

At higher levels any other melee will produce hate faster than a
Paladin or Shadowknight, until, that is, you factor in the knight
classes' spellcasting.  Stuns are crucial for maintaining aggro
while tanking as a Paladin.  Cease in particular is extremely
valuable for a long time, for pulling, for aggro control, and for
caster interrupts (it can interrupt mobs of up to level 55).
