    If you truly believed that there was a vengeful, Old Testament-style God
that would watch your every action and thought and would deny you
everlasting bliss (and instead put you through everlasting torment) if you
weren't true to Him at all times, you might also feel uneasy about
"roleplay" worshipping anything else. Like a godless person like me would
know anything about that. :-)
