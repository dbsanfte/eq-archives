}I'm perhaps a little off the topic of this thread but I'd like to say a few
}things about my views on these points.

This thread is already way off topic for the group.  No worries. :)

}> The mere creation of the department is not a problem, as there _is_ a need
}> for better security.  Unfortunately, Bush isn't willing to do what really
}> needs to be done to protect the country.  Instead of dealing with
}> protecting our borders, he's shifting the burden onto the backs of the 
}> American citizens.  This isn't very conservative.
}No.  You mean the mere creation of a "Department of Homeland Security" is
}not a problem -- as a matter of fact, I would heartily agree with such a
}department.

Shoot, I wouldn't.  The very name screams black helicopters at me.

}The problem is the create of a "Big Brother Department" which
}is named the "Department of Homeland Security" in a rather transparent
}effort to conceal the fact that it is being given far too much power to
}interfere with personal liberties.

And the problem behind the problem is that there really is no way to 
enhance security without compromising said liberties.  And when you 
combine that with my personal contention that there really isn't such a 
thing as effective security, it seems like a rather pointless endeavour.

}> Not very conservative.  It's an expansion of government into the lives of
}> citizens.  That includes the war on drugs.
}The war on drugs is a joke.  They're not stopping shit, all they're doing is
}punishing random people for doing something to themselves, not to anyone
}else.  The government should not have the right to protect you from
}yourself.

Yup.  Total agreement.  They can have the right not to have to fix 
problems I brought on myself though.  All I see the War on Drugs doing is 
providing price supports for drug dealers.

}I would understand if they were to limit the use of drugs like
}PCP that can make people hurt others, but things like heroin and coke,
}although it's stupid to use them, should still be legal because nobody is
}hurt except for the user.

Ehh, I think there's some evidence that heroin might belong more in the 
PCP class.  Amphetamines and Cocaine definitely cause stimulant psychosis, 
which could end up impacting others.  But again, that's a big -could-.  
There are probably people who can -use- any drug, rather than -abusing- 
it, and I don't think it should be up to the government to tell us which 
we are doing.

}And... weed?  Please!  Marijuana is probably the
}most harmless drug in existence.  There has never been a single documented
}death from marijuana overdose... you'd probably have to smoke several pounds
}of the stuff, and I don't know if you'd even be able to smoke that much fast
}enough to have lethal levels of THC in your system.  If they're going to
}consider that a danger they might as well outlaw alcohol, tobacco, and
}tylenol.

Well, certain combinations of Tylenol are listed in the federal controlled 
substances act already, IIRC.  Personally, I think the CSA is highly 
bogus.  It was clearly crafted by politicians, rather than people who 
actually know a lot about drugs.  Example:  The listed difference between 
Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances is that shcedule I 
substances have -no known medical use- and schedule II has -a currently 
accepted medical use-.  And yet, despite mounds of evidence, marijuana and 
THC are listed as schedule I and PCP is listed as schedule II.  PCP may 
possibly be argued to be acceptable as a horse tranquilizer, but that's 
veterinary, not medical.  And that's just the most glaringly obvious 
example here...  And nicotine?  Nicotine isn't even listed despite meeting 
all the criteria for schedule I.  Unless it being a pesticide is somehow 
supposed to be a medical use.  Yeah, right.  

}> Not how they also have some hefty resistance from the right.

As I recall, this was in response to a quote from the actual Republican 
party platform...  Is there some other group out there that you feel 
represents the 'right'?

}> Which side has been the most activist with the social workers?

Debateable.  Both sides have different ideas about what the social workers 
should be doing, and neither has been particularly shy about telling them 
so.

}> Which side has tried to outlaw corpral punishment?

Umm... both?  That strikes me as an exception, where it -might- not be a 
bad thing, depending how the legislation is worded.  In many cases, 
corporal punishment would definitely qualify as abuse.  And I don't think 
that anyone outside of the actual family should -ever- have corporal 
punishment available as an option.  It's a very difficult question.

}> Which side has endorsed handing out condemns in high schools, 
}> regardless of what the parents want?  If you want to see the government 
}> dictate how you raise your children, look to the left, that's their 
}> forte.

Let's just say, then, that when the left (whoever they are... :) ) tries 
to dictate family values, they come a lot closer to the actual values of 
my family.  Passing out condoms in HS in no way inhibits me from telling 
my kids that contraception is bad and against God.  Not that I feel that 
way, mind you.

}All right... while I agree that the government should not regulate your
}personal life and while I do think that in some cases the government
}interferes in people's family life too much... with all due respect your
}family does *not*, I repeat *not*, belong to *you*.  Your family members
}belong to *themselves*.  While it's ok and necessary to punish your kids 
}when they're wrong and to raise them to have certain values, if you hurt 
}them you're not hurting an object in your posession, you're hurting a 
}human being.  I know I speak from a valid standpoint because my own 
}family life very nearly killed me.  I'm not trying to condemn Remington 
}for what he does with his family, I don't know anything about him... but 
}it is *not* "your goddamn family".

Would you settle for "our goddamn family, and not the government's"?  I 
did not intend to imply that I had sole exclusive control of my family in 
a way that impinged on their control of themselves.

Corporal punishment is a very difficult question that I don't think will 
ever be adequately worked out.  On the one hand, there's spanking your 
child for having tried for the sixth time to run into the Flaming Inferno 
of Death after you've repeatedly warned him of the danger, and on the 
other hand, there's administering a bone-breaking belt-whupping for asking 
"why?" to everything you say for half an hour.

And if you do decide that spanking is an appropriate part of your child's 
discipline, you've really no room to object if they grow up and get 
involved in BDSM, now, do you?

}It is your responsibility to raise your kids to be healthy because you 
}brought them into the world.  But they are not there for you, you are 
}there for them.  Period.

We are there for us.  But then, that's a statement of -my- family values.  
Which may differ from yours, and may differ from those outlined in the 
Republican Party platform.

}As far as the government handing out condoms in public schools... if the
}only way you can raise your kids properly is to withhold knowledge from them
}then you're doing something wrong.  If you don't think it's wise for your
}kids to have sex at their age then tell them that and explain why you feel
}that way.  But trust me when I tell you that if they want to have sex, they
}will... they're not going to be handed a condom and think, "Oh, well I
}wasn't planning on having sex but now I have to so I won't waste this!"  All
}that's going to happen is they're going to have sex without the condom if
}they can't get one or are too lazy to take the time... and believe me, you
}*don't* want that.

}> Judges should be prohibited.  That's what legislators are for.  The
}> Florida Supreme Court already had a hard enough time ruling on the law 
}> as it was, without actually giving them license to re-write it at 
}> will.

My point was more that if any decision, for or against this position, is 
going to be taken, it's a state issue and not federal.  But the first part 
of the statement I disagree with in its entirety.  If I want to marry a 
rock to a hamster, I don't think that's in any way the government's 
business.  If two people of non-opposing genders want to get married, I 
feel that the government owes them the same recognition they would give to 
any other union of love.  After all, by the statement they give, anyone 
with Kleinfelter's syndrome is inherently excluded from ever being in a 
recognized marriage, period.  It would be nice if gender were a nice 
simple binary question, but it ain't.  It would be very convenient if 
sexuality was inherently tied to gender, but it ain't.  Grow up and deal 
with it.
