I was disconnected from the Veeshan Sever at 1:45AM on 9/1/01(Big
Black Screen)-Why and what do I do if I find myself dead?  I had about
4-5 MOBs chasing me at the time, so I am pretty sure I am dead.  Was
not a problem with my network or ISP, as I was able to go everything
else (web browse/mail/etc.) afterwards.

I am able to petition a GM and have me restored?  If so, how do I do
this?

Thanks

Steve Charles
