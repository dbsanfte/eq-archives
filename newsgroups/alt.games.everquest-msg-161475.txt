From a Rallos veteran since April 1999:

Upon killing a player, you can take all coin on the corpse, plus 1 item.
Item exceptions are: Weapon, Shield, Range and Ammo slots, containers and
items inside them, and items that are tagged No Drop.

You'll generally find that the PKers who are more oriented around killing to
cause grief carry no coin, and are largely decked out in no drop equipment.
Fact of life, I guess.

They tried this on Rallos wayyyyy back in the day, and it went over like a
fart in church. I don't believe it's in effect anymore; if it is, then it's
only in effect for "city" zones.

On Rallos, we prefer to choose our own enemies and allies, thank you very
much.

Bards are not the BEST offensive class in regards to PvP, but they're no
slouches if properly equipped. The nice part about Bards is that they get
Selo's very early. I believe Selo's still breaks Root spells, and makes you
run very very fast. This means that a Bard can generally choose his battles,
and is hard to corner. Resists are key, more on that later.

Charm and Fear no longer work against other players, and thank God. I
remember what Rallos USED to be like....

Most of the changes they've made to PvP have been for the better.  Not just
DD spells, but all damage-dealing spells only do 2/3 of the damage against a
player as they would against an NPC. This makes a significant difference at
lower levels, but not so much at higher levels.

And, they did make some adjustments to resists over 100 recently. Not sure
yet quite how they work, perhaps another poster can shed some light...

No charming or fearing, I'm afraid, but as a Dark Elven Necromancer(widely
regarded as the most fearsome PvP class), I don't relish fighting bards. So,
I would say yes they can be tough nuts to crack.


 I'm glad you're enjoying yourself and hope you stick it out. A few more
pointers:

-RESISTS ARE KEY. This is especially true if you are going to play a
non-caster(that includes Bards). I would say that MR is your first priority.
Then, since it's difficult to raise them both to 100 without buffs or level
50+ gear, choose between CR and HR.

-YOU WILL BE PKed. There is no one on Rallos, that I am aware of, that has
not been ganked(and ganked good)at least once. It will happen sooner or
later. Accept it. Pick yourself up and keep going.

-MAKE FRIENDS AND FIND A GUILD. The friendships you make on this server will
prove to be your doing or undoing. Having friends/guildmates you can trust
is more important on Rallos than it is on any other server in this game.
Period. You'll find that the more you are solo, the more you'll be targeted
by PKs. They are much less likely to attack a group. Make friends early and
often.

Feel free to look me up in-game if I can lend a hand with anything. Most new
players to Rallos stay for 10 levels and leave. If you can stick it out,
though, I can tell you from experience that you'll never be willing to play
anywhere else again.:)
