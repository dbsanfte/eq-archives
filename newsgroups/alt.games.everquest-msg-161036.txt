I'm mad! Really mad.

Since when it their policy to delete characters only because then want a
surname change.

Here is the conversation:

[Thu Nov 07 23:03:38 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'Greetings.  Guide Shuminah
here.  How can I help you?'
[Thu Nov 07 23:04:15 2002] You told shuminah, 'Hi I wonder if it possible to
have my surename capitalized? it's only two letters'
Thu Nov 07 23:04:36 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'No, Im afraid not.  What is
your current surname ?'
[Thu Nov 07 23:04:42 2002] You told Shuminah, 'Md'
[Thu Nov 07 23:07:10 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'Im afraid that it is not
possible for you to have a surname in all capitals..  Yes you may get it
removed but when you do think of a new name you will have to repetition for
it.   Would you like for me to send your petition to the GM for removal?'
[Thu Nov 07 23:07:29 2002] You told Shuminah, 'yes please'
[Thu Nov 07 23:08:19 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'Alright then I shall do
that.  Do you want a new surname or would you just like your current one
removed until you re-petition for it later?'
[Thu Nov 07 23:09:36 2002] You told Shuminah, 'I already know one'
[Thu Nov 07 23:09:43 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'Alright lets hear it =)'
[Thu Nov 07 23:10:23 2002] You told Shuminah, 'Aka'medic'
[Thu Nov 07 23:10:47 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'Hmmmmmmmmmmm'
[Thu Nov 07 23:11:06 2002] You told Shuminah, 'not good?'
[Thu Nov 07 23:11:35 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'No sorry =)'
[Thu Nov 07 23:12:22 2002] You told Shuminah, 'Medicus?'
[Thu Nov 07 23:12:59 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'Yes you may have that.'
[Thu Nov 07 23:13:15 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'I will let the GM know that
you would like your name changed.  =)'

Aha we were talking about a surname, not name. OK I continue:

[Thu Nov 07 23:13:18 2002] You told Shuminah, 'heh, thank you. still has
something of medic in it'
[Thu Nov 07 23:13:32 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'yes it does.  I take it your
a doctor./urse?'
[Thu Nov 07 23:13:36 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'Nurse*'
[Thu Nov 07 23:14:13 2002] You told Shuminah, 'No I think it a very
roleplaying name, also Hospik is Medic in dutch'
[Thu Nov 07 23:14:37 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'Oh I see..  Well it is
fine.. Great choice in names =)'

Ok so I thought it will be taken care off. When I logged in the next morning
my character had been deleted! OMG I have been screwed big time!! Anyway I
have sent an email to the GM's, I hope they sort it out soon because I have
a guildmeeting today.
