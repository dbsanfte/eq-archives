A bit of clarification please.

If I have a number of items equipped which proc - I believe that they
all act completely independently of each other - is that true?

So - for instance - If I equip something that procs 5 times in every
100 hits on average - and then equip a new item that procs 5 times in
every 100 hits - I understand that I can expect that with both item
equipped (and all other things like dex etc being equal) - I could
expect a total of 10 procs per 100 hits on average.

Please can you confirm or correct my understanding please.
Thanks in advance.
