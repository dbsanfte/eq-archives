Agreed. The reason those mobs hit for 1000+ and have hundreds
of thousands of hitpoints is because of broken mechanics like Cheal.

IMHO the high level game is broken and stupid. I should be able to
replace 1 cleric with 2 or 3 druids or shaman for healers at any level
of the game and in the lower levels that is true. I am sick and tired
of having to have the holy trinity with me whenever I want to go any
where or raid anything or be forced to play one of those classes
myself.

For most of the game you can go places with 3 or 4 people of almost
any class combination and you can do ok, you may not be optimal
but you can kill and get decent loot and exp. At the high levels this
gets more and more difficult.

Spells like Cheal are 'too' essential. The game being boiled down
to just a handful tactics at the high end is silly.

High level raids suck and are boring. I fucking hate them.

1. Pull mob.
2. Everyone assist MA.
3. Cheal rotation.
4. Mob dead, loot, roll.
5. Go to 1.

BORING!

And if one mistake is made? Total wipeout. Now spend the
next hour doing CR and rezzes. BORING.

I find it stupid that a raid consisting of 30-40+ people all
get wiped out because the MA, the cleric or the enchanter
dies. Stupid.
