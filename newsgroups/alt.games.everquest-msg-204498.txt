On Stromm you go to Kaesora, or ToFS, or the Orc Fort in EW, or
LGuk, or SolB, or ...  You know, places where gear drops.  On
mature servers pharmers go there and sell stuff with their mules
in the bazaar, alongside the mules of players who've outgrown
those drops.  On Stromm, for now at least, for every pharmer
after stuff to sell for pp there're a couple (or more) groups
out to improve themselves (or possibly absent guildies).

LOL James, you're almost as mean to Dennis as I am to people I think
have posted stupid shit, you've been training him to not answer you!
