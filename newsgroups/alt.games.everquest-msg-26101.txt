 I find that my "Fine Plate" is not what it used to be at lower levels. I
have slowly been changing it out for Lighter,  with better resistance. I
changed my FP Gauntlets for Blackened Alloy and saved a tremendous amount of
weight though I took a 1 AC hit.

 I banked my Dark Reaver when a guy sold me a "Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword
24/39 for (get this) 75pp. (hehe my lucky day).

I now use Iskar Scaled Gloves as opposed to my FP. (Gift from guild master)

 I am now in the market for a good Breast Plate. I know I will probably have
to quest for this and I guess I am prepared to give the time. I usually solo
and seldom group. So it will prolly be tough.

 Can anyone tell me a good Human SK Breastplate with at least decent AC and
decent Magic resistance's please?

Thank You In advance:-)
