I had a friend who was a ranger.  He and his girlfriend used to hang out in
the Qeynos area when they weren't doing anything else.  One day it was my
friend's birthday and his girlfriend and I decided we'd get him a pressie.
She had money, and being a rogue I was able to travel to riskyish places, so
she handed me a stack of cash and told me to make my way across the Karanas
and pick up a combine longsword, which we then gave to him.

I remember thinking wouldn't it have been nice to be able to have some sort
of "happy birthday" message engraved on the sword.  Not ALL items - just a
few, perhaps with a specific request to a GM involved so they can moderate
the use of the feature.  I also thought it'd be neat if you could have
"mobile" message boards.  These noticeboards that appear in pubs and
suchlike.  I think it'd be handy if you could buy paper and pencil, write
out messages and hand them to other players.  You could use that in guild
quests and such, I bet.
