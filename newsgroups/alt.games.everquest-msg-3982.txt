11:30pm- collecting FS in cazic thule as a lowbie just trying to make a buck
(and helping the high levels with their trains)...
12:00am - friend gives me a tell that he is nearby and wants to hunt.
            We decide on Befallen since it is about our level and can get
some decent loot
12:15am - run to merchant to sell FS
1:00am - after a few kills in swamp (finally got that NPC who plagued me
early on) and oasis, we run to nek forest
1:15am - both go LD about same time and lost 15 mins...Strange, we both had
a power loss on opposite ends of country (queue in twilight zone music)
1:30am - reach neriak where we spend another 15 mins getting a bind
1:45am - gather a small group and head to befallen
2:00am - hunt some wisps and stuff in No Ro while waiting for whole group to
assemble from various zones.  Finally enter
2:15am - everyone is ready, buffed, med etc.  (luckily one group member had
all needed keys)  Yawning big time now
2:45am - reach 2nd floor after killing low levels and awaiting spawns -
bleary eyed and falling asleep
3:00am - Finally hit the mobs we can all kill and get exp and good loot
3:05am - one member goes LD and never comes back
3:07am - another member dies
3:15am - waiting... waiting.... waiting
3:30am - too tired to go on.  Dead member logs and says tomorrow.  LD member
never returns.  Remaining members stuck behind locked doors and camp for the
night

So I killed maybe 5 mobs all night that were worth a point or 2... All in
all it was a very fun night and I look forward to tomorrow
