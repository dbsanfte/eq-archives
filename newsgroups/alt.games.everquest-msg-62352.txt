There is a way in Zone Alarm to overcome that problem, though I cannot
recall what it is. I used to use ZA before I got hardware protection,
and one of the good folks here told me how to fix that. You might try
doing a Google search for the answer, so that you can keep ZA active
while you play EQ.

If I had a Windows key, I'd be in big trouble. I'm sure there are ways
to disable it. 

My keyboard is an old Gateway2000 model with two sets of function keys
and *diagonal* cursor keys. I'm crippled without it. Sigh.

I've experienced a few lockups too, but I imagine that it's been less
than a dozen in the 2.5 years I've been playing. And I don't recall
any of them resulting in a death.

I'm a developer, too, but have also been a support tech. An important
lesson that any support tech knows is that if 300,000 people use a
piece of software, and most of them have no serious problems, but a
few people do have problems, the likely culprit is the computers of
those few people. It's not always correct, but it's the logical
starting point.
