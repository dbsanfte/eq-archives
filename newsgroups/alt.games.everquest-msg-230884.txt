That dexterity is important.

Seems his and everyone's point I have seen is that the effect on procs
of 30 points of dexterity is minimal.  But the effect of 30 points of
*any* stat is minimal.  So what?

That's an unfair comparison because agility is usually considered
worthless for anyone in any situation.

What I am saying is that while 30 points of dexterity may not make
much difference, 30 points of any stat won't make "much" difference. 
The *point* is that 100 or 150 points of dexterity or stamina *will*
make a difference.  It all adds up.

Stamina, to me, has been easier to raise than dexterity.

Most information in this game is sadly based on what "they" say,
imperfect scientific studies (parses), and personal experience.  In my
opinion, (yes my opinion; if you claim to "know" one way or the other
then you are full of shit) dexterity helps me get more criticals.  I
will see my dexterity swing over 120 points, from base hp-type gear to
dexterity gear with buffs.  I get crits *much* more often with high
dexterity.  "They" say that dexterity is important for criticals.

I searched around and found no parses or other studies that quantified
the affect of dexterity on procs and criticals.  If you find one let
me know.  So for now, I have to operate on what things "seem" like.

I don't know what that even means.  I have spent hours and hours
practicing weapon skills because I didn't bother with them early on. 
If it cuts that time down, I'm all for it.

It is useful when you aren't taking damage and don't expect to take
any either.  HP mean nothing in those circumstances.  And once again
my main point was that stamima is cheap.  It's on everything.  Getting
dexterity up is not as easy.  Don't try to turn this in to which stat
is more important.  Which will help you more will depend on the
situation.  Maxing stamina is very important.  But dex does help and
it isn't as easy to raise.
