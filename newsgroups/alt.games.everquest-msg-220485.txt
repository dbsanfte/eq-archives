Nope you're right.  I've just never come close to my encumbrance limit 
except in bazaar.  And also on the rare occasions I play early in the 
morning before my brain is in gear after going trader all night.  I've 
occasionally been known to arrive in Butcherblock before I realise why 
it is that I'm running so slow.  

Encumberance may well be a consideration for characters with low STR.
