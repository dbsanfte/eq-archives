Really?  I thought everyone started at 70 :/

And that wasn't my point.

In your view, in other peoples view, the game doesnt really start until 65+
everything before is a long tutorial.

Not everyone feels the same, for me the lower levels were some of the most
fun times, for sure.  But the hardest and most satisfying were at the higher
levels, becoming almost a god was great, but this has nothing do with buying
plat, and you haven't disproved anything I said above.

For someone starting out, there is no problem with them buying plat, you
could argue plat farmers would hold down camps etc etc, but people do that
anyway.

The option to buy plat helps EQ survive, not die.
