Sure, then again there is always that 10th person. =) I literally have
not had a virus ever on my personal machine. Spyware, yes from time to
time. If only because sometimes you need to use that program that
comes packed with spyware, because you are too cheep to buy a pay
version of it. =) If I suspect that I have a virus, I will format the
HD and install from scratch, using the files I back up regularly. A
little common sense and some preparation is all it takes. (And part of
that common sense is that I do in fact have an anti-virus on my
computer, that is kept up to date. Better safe than sorry.)

I'm not going to say that I'll never get a virus, but with the proper
precautions someone has to screw up by the numbers to do it. And that
someone may be me or Microsoft.

(Actually one exception to that never had a virus thing. I put
together a trash computer to run Win 3.1 and DOS 6.0 for working on
when I was in college taking CoSci courses.  We had to use floppy
disks (This is just about the time Windows 98 came out) to learn how
to use DOS and Win 3.1, even though it was obsolete by that time. I'm
not sorry that I did have to learn it, because on occasion I've had to
use that knowledge even on WinXP machines (the command prompt can
still be used to do things for those fortunately rare people who just
can not be taught how to use the GUI but can still type things in to a
command prompt if you go very slow and phonetically spell every last
character out for them.) so it wasn't a complete waste. However to do
all this learning we had to swap a lot of floppies around and there
was no way I was going to do my home work on my personal machine, so I
put together a trash box to do it. Of course there was a new virus on
those floppy disks every day...)
