Hand them in one at a time until you get the quest reward, that will take 
1 to 4 of them, depending on how many someone before you gave him.  After 
that, give them to him 4 at a time, not stacked.

Don't know the quest off hand, so it depends on what specific type of 
ore.

That is correct, no merchant will buy them, however, they may be useful 
for something, either tradeskill related, or a quest.

Did you look up while swimming at the ladder?
