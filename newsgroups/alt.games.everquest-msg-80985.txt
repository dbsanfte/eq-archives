Amen to that!!.
I have a 53 mage and 51 ranger, both I had to bring them up the hard
way.. but I have several alts and I twinked the DAYLIGHTS out of them.

Some folks can do the hard way each time they create a new alt.. but
not me. To each his/her own I say.

I heavily twinked my beastlord.. high wis items, and AC items
He is 27 now, but at 17 he was dual welding a centi war hammer and
wrathbone hammer. Gifts from his BIG brothers ;-)
