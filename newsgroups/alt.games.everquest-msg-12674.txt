    Right now I wouldn't recommend it. Too little can be made that's of use
to anyone for the cost/time of making it.

    And the time, too, I hope. My ENCH spent time on the weekend making
Viscous Mana (the level 12 spell) for my main's tailoring. 200 mana per
cast, so she could make 6 on a bar of mana and about three every four
minutes thereafter (Clarity up at all times, level 30 ENCH with 150ish INT
and 100-odd in plus MANA.) The one for pottery takes *600* mana per cast.
And since your friend's initial failure rate will be high....
