Why not claim banks are never robbed, and if I wish to support my claim that
they are in fact robbed, I have to rob one?

No, I have a better idea for a moron such as you-- 

To the Krew with you.

PS. One final shot, in your other post, you claimed that the hacker in Cuckoos
egg was only getting into EDU computers, and using one method. Read the book
next time before commenting on it. Cliff's notes may have gotten you through
freshman books and ideas, but this is the grown-up world you now try to play
in.

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."
