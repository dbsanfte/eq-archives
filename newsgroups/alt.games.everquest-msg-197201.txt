A) they almost certainly weren't 60, to start with.  61 is easy to achieve,
and with people knowing POP was coming with extra levels, many people were
already as close as possible to 61 before the release.  I'd bet that at
least half the first group to get flagged was 61, and more than likely it
was all 62s.   62 is "the wall" where it takes serious dedication to level
up further without a flag.

B) even if they were 60, they weren't like you or me or anyone else in this
discussion except perhaps Meemers if he shows his head.  They had been level
60 for a year or two, had everyone using Primal weapons for the proc, Vex
Thal loots, VP loots... really serious high end gear, in pre  POP terms, and
heck, still far more serious than what 9/10ths of the level 65 people you'll
meet will have on them now.  Cleric with FT 15 and IH III and MP III and
Spell Haste III items can make a fair substitute for a 65 cleric in crap
gear, particularly when his buddies are wearing 8K+ HP in gear and swinging
weapons with a ration half again as anything the average 65 warrior has
today, so on and so forth.  You don't see level 60s like that today, because
everyone that was that uber rapidly leveled up to 65, and anyone now
gathering that kind of gear is also going to be able to shoot up to 65 well
before getting fully kitted out.  Levels are a lot easier to get than much
of that sort of equipment.
