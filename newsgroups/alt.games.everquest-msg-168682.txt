Luclin pretty much evacuated Lguk on AR for sure... used to be too many ppl,
now it's just the big bosses or monks camping Raster.

My first introduction to Lguk I was soo exicited!  And those froggies!
Little did I know that between lguk ans seb, I be soo sick of frogs!  I can
see now why the Iksar hate them so much.
