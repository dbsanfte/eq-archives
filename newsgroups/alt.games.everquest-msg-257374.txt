    The epic quest (2.0) will require drops in the end zone of OoW, and the
epic will have stats better than other similar-slot items in the zone. By
the end zone of the expansion after OoW items with better stats will have
been found. That's how I'd plan it if I were a dev, to get maximum "omg
gotta get it" impact out of it.
