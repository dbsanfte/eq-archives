Actually she was booted from the game for violating her agreement
regarding her position as a Guide.  Once you violate a trust you can no
longer be trusted with power.  Beyond that another major factor was the
fact that many of the real Guides, the ones who devoted their personal
time to actually trying to help people were greatly insulted by what she
had done.  Not just the violation of the rules, but to portray Guides as
uncaring bastards who laugh at players rather than feel for them when
they have problems.  More than a few good Guides left in disgust over
her cute little attempt at fame.  Next time you read one of Tukka's
posts complaining about CS, think of Tweety.  Her efforts helped to weed
out some folks who really cared.
