There are lots of folks here, some may even still be reading this thread.  
Seriously, tell us your class, and we can probably give you some helpful 
pointers on where to go, and maybe even how to go about fighting the mobs 
there.  At level 13ish, it's still largely hack and slash, unless you are a 
pure caster.  Personally, at level 13, I would be in Paludal Caverns, 
killing mushrooms that are blue to white, until they go light blue.  Then 
move on to the next mobs that are blue, rinse and repeat until you are 
level 23, it takes very little time, even when you count in eating deaths.
