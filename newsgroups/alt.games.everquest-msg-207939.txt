The only reason I have any clue how to play an enchanter is because I 
have watched others doing so.  Playing mine to level 25 has taught me 
almost nothing about it, admittedly largely due to my soloing my way to 
25.  I did 99% of that without external buffs, I've had 2 KEIs, one so I 
could do massive amounts of enchanting clay, and one from a guildie that 
happened to be nearby, that second one is still going, as I have not 
played her much in a while.  You do get the spell lines that you will use 
later on, but, they are less than necessary for getting into the 20s.  I 
did most of my levelling in Paludal, killing various mobs with DoTs, 
nukes, and my pet, I ate a few deaths, but, it was taking one or two 
kills to make that xp back.
