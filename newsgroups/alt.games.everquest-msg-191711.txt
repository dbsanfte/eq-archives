1. Do not break a mezz. Ever. If you break a mezz, I will find out from your
raid's enchanter, and then I will hunt you down and break your knuckles.
There's nothing worse than having everything well under control, all the
adds are mezzed, you're running through the cycle again (refreshing mezzes),
when suddenly you get the message "a forsaken revenant has been awoken by
<insert idiot name here>" and there's the mob, pissed off as all hell and
beating you down.

2. NEVER DoT until it's clear that the mob that's currently being engaged is
the mob that is going to be going down to 0% health. Just because the MA
hits a mob, doesn't necessarily mean that that mob will be the one that you
kill. For example, in PoH, forsaken revenants, liches, rats, etc., are all
fairly easily mezzable. However, Spite Golems and Clerics of Innoruuk are
NOT mezzable easily. You need to land a tash, then hope to god you can
channel Dazzle through that Tash, because if you can't, you're a greasy
spot. So certain mobs tend to get priority for a kill, and if one of them
adds in the middle of a fight, expect to be changing targets since the Enc
can easily lock down whatever you're fighting.

3. Listen to orders. ALWAYS listen to orders. Unless you are part of the CC
group, the MA, or the SA, or you have something that is -really- important
(add, death in group, etc), you shouldn't be talking in the raid channel.
Encs are there to give notice of what's locked down, MA and SA are there to
announce what's currently being targetted, and if there's an add or a death,
they'll want to know, especially if it's a Cleric, Enc or Bard. Other than
that, believe me, it can wait until you're done with the 5 mobs that just
got pulled by accident.

4. Be patient. Raids take a while to set up, to get groups together, etc.
The break-in group always has to go first to establish control over the
area, then groups two and three. Trouble is, it's a bit of a problem to
establish these groups, because you know what? Player A may be the highest
level Enc on the raid, but if he's spent his whole time as a buff-whore, and
Player B's a level lower but is known for good CC, then a judgement call has
to be made.

5. If you've got a mob on you, DON'T START RUNNING AROUND WITH IT CHASING
YOU. We were doing PoH the other day, a bit of a pickup raid (our server has
something called the Karana Council of Guilds, which is basically a lot of
different guilds joining together for shots at different targets, mostly
smaller guilds with some larger ones mixed in so they have enough under 52s
for a shot at, for example, Vox or Naggy. IE, fairly decent sized guilds
such as AA, ES, and IOS) and a druid had a revenant on her. Rather than
sitting still so I could target and get a mezz off, she starts running
around. You know what? She died, because I couldn't target the damn revenant
to save her until it was standing still over her dead body.

Just a few hints for a successful raid, there's plenty more.
