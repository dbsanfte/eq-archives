Curious, do you have to limit certain graphical features usually to use EQW
effectively?  I've thought about using it, simply so I could change music in
WinAmp and look up maps on eqatlas while playing or quests or whatever.

My system specs:

Athlon 1800
512 MB RAM
GeForce 3 Ti500
Sound Blaster Audigy
60 GB HDD
Cable Modem Connection
