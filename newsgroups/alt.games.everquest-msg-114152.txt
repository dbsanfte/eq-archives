Some of the sounds in the game are horribly uneven for me, which I
attribute to flaws in the sound engine rather than the true recorded
volume.

Ding is actually very quiet for me. Almost a whisper. Certain attack
sounds (but only a few) are horribly loud.

Worse, the sound volumes don't seem to give a hoot what the actual
volume settings are. I had the in-game slider turned completely down,
and still the loud sounds would come out at normal volume. 

EQs sound has beens crewed up for me for so long that I usually just
play without any sound at all now. I turn off the sounds in the
Options area as the game is loading.
