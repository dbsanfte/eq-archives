My necro at level 55 has only put his training points into research.  At his
level, it's a little bit too expensive to fail a combine.  My primary
suggestion is that you definately hold on to any words that you find.  My
necro hordes words (8 backpacks full of purely necro words in the bank) in
case I need something researched.

You can always sell words for other classes in the Bazaar.  Or you can
research spells for them as well.  My necro used his Book of Dark Bindings
to research spells for other classes as well.
