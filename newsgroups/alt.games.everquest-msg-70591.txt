Try searching on Google:

Win 95 and Win 98 have a screwy bug where if the amount of physical RAM 
added to your AGP aperture size go over 800 (or something) Windows will 
just gobble up all your RAM to use as virtual memory cache. This means that 
if you add more than 512Mb (exactly 512Mb seems to be OK) on some systems 
they will start going out of memory and having random crashes.

The simplest fix is just to set min and max limits for vcache in 
system.ini, then Windows will never go above the max value so it won't eat 
all your RAM. The easiest way to do that is probably to just run cacheman 
(available from all good shareware/freeware sites) - you can chuck it away 
afterwards if you want, since it mostly just tweaks your ini files and 
registry to do its work, but you can also leave it running in the 
background to grab back memory every so often that Windows often doesn't 
want to give back - useful if you're running programs with bad memory leaks 
- it was the only way to play Anarchy Online for more than 10 minutes when 
it was released for example, not that you'd want to play it for more than 
10 minutes, mind you.
