Heh. that's what I end up doing a lot of times. or look up at the sky.
Some area's do really good though. Like The bottom floor in befallen is
very fast for me. And the front of Konar Castle. It might just be a
problem with the way the zones are designed. I'm sure they aren't BSP
tree's like unreal or quake would have. The LOD option doesn't seem to do
much frame rate wise. Maybe 3-4 fps in the test I've done. I was in
over there once on the ledge screwing with it and it will drop a few of the
far off mobs and plants and rocks. I really hope they get it going up to
speed cause it's really good in a lot of places for me over the old
engine. Too bad someone doesn't have some kind of bench mark for EQ
written. like using the tutorial.exe file and running though a zone 10
times and showing the time it took.

Take care.
