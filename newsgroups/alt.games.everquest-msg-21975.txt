Crash,
    If you hunt with a regular group and you're sure that they are going to
be online most of the of the time that you are then head your entire group
to highpass and hunt gnolls.  Bind everyone in the keep, then learn the maze
and start spillin gnoll blood.  They yield good exp for your level (if you
have a full group... a shade low for you solo'ing), you can start making
decent money there with vendors and bank nearby, and there's a shot at two
PHAT items nearby: Polished Granite Tomahawk and CDS (charred guardian
shield, guys?  Or is that the one from SolA?)
