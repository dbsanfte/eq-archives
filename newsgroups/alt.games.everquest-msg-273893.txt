Whether or not I violate the EULA or not hardly makes me a good or bad
person.  No one is asking for your trust.  I am selling the account.  I
don't play the account any longer, and have no interest in retrieving it.
Once it is yours, it is yours to stay.  I don't know how the retrieval
works, nor do I care.  What I do care about is making some money from
something I do not use any longer.
