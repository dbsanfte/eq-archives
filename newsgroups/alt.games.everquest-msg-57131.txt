You still don't get it do you?
I am NOT limiting the discussion to high end games.
The players who play at that level are competent--they absolutely have
to be to play at that level.

Find these people, put them in an normal non end game exp grind group.
Now get a SK who is at the same level of game play.  Ask them to try
and hold aggro.

A warrior dual weilding low delay weapons that (more than likely)
procs will ALWAYS win by virtual of the stupid game engine!

The game engine doesn't really give a shit if you just smack something
for 700hps or 7hps.  All it cares (well, mostly anyways) about in
determine melee aggro is the *FREQUENCY* of those smacks.

Last I checked SKs didn't get dual weild and their taunt was CAPPED at
180 whereas warriors got dual weild, with taunt cap at 230!  That's a
*50* point difference.  To give you an idea, that's *TEN FUCKING
LEVELS OF TAUNT* difference.

Combine that with the fact that proccing weapons are so stupidly cheap
these days practically ANY tank past level 30 can obtain one.  

Remember those SSoY?  Those that used to cost 5k+ pre-Kunark?  They
are sold for less than 600pps these days!  

Go in to Velk or Karnor or Sebilis or Chardok or any of the exp grind
dungeons.  Check the equipment on the warriors in those zones.  Almost
universally they are weilding some sort of proccing weapon.

Can't depend on a proc to go off?  Bullshit.
My twinkies frostbringer generally procs 2 times per fight against
those Velk spiders and those fights are very short!

Toss a snare whip or yak, and just see how "easy" it is for a SK
swinging his low delay 2H sword to steal aggro.
