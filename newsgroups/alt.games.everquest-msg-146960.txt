Iceclad Ocean.
The ideal place for quadding! Start with the Snow Cougars. One at the time
till you get the hang of it. At 30, start quadding! When they start getting
lblue, move to the Dire Wolves in the same zone.
I actually believe I went from like 30-40 in this zone.
Oh, and THEN, from the early 40's : Spec Island in Ocean Of Tears! EXCELLENT
place. Just remember to remove the Gargoyles there. They aggro, no matter
what level you are. They will be replaced by Skeletons that DON'T aggro, so
leave them alone.
4 Spectres pop there. One quad, and med up. By the time you're at FM,
they're ready for another round. And free bonus : short run to Sister Island
to sell the Scythes they drop. And you have the Oracle Island 10 seconds
away. Take him and his Pally Guardian out easily for the Robe of the Oracle.
Oh man, I did from like 40-47 out here.
Good luck.
