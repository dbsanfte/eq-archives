Its the little things that drive us up the wall.

Some people just cant tolerate the thought of EQ2.  Is it the end of
the world?

But for me, what has ruined the game is the character models. 
Generally I just leave Luclin models off.  But recently I tried yet
again to get accustomed.  Turned them all on.  Whoosh.  They are just
plain awful.  I know, I know...   Lot of you like them.  That's not
the point.

What ruins things is this...   I want to know what I look like.  These
days I have no idea.  If a friend has Luclin models turned on, what
the hell is he seeing?  Am I a sweet little lady gnome or an old evil
lady gnome?  Am I a slightly plump dwarf cleric or am I a skinny bandy
legged dwarf in peddlepushers?  Am I a heroic Barbarian maid or am I a
really screwed up disfigured wretch with boobs bigger than my head?

I have no problem with others making the choice of what they want to
see.  But I have major problems with how they see me.

Well off goes Luclin models yet again.  For about the 20th time,
having tried and tried, got to say...   they really are bad.

And for all of you who like them, well thats great.  Glad you do.  But
I dont.  And thats the point.  I want you to see me as I wish to be
seen.  This is our fantasy, right?

Struggling with getting my original characters back now, which is
another lovely feature of the new luclin models.  Change the luclin
looks and you totally mess up your original character.  Argh!

OK flame off...  LOL I feel MUCH better.
