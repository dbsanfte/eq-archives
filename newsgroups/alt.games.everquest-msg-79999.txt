And right there is my point.  Yes, I realize that Archers in our r/l History
have been more than effective with their bows, but the suggestion that in
this game a Ranger is able to do similar damage with an arrow that he/she
can do with their sword(s) is a bit ridiculous.

My Ranger is just fine with her abilities as they are.  She can melee better
than most excepting of course for Warriors and a couple others, she can use
her bow effectively to pull and crit with, and she can help out with spells
and so forth.

You're right that most of this new found Ranger lust is Legolas related.
And, before someone calls me a Legolas hater, I do have his Desktop Theme
and Screensaver on this computer...hehe  Yes, I saw the movie and yes I'm in
love with the little blond shit, but not enough to rip off his name or try
to make my Ranger a Superhero-like character from a book or movie.

Just my 2 cents.
