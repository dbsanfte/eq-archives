Just realised there was some context missing from the posting you quote
above because it's in another posting...

I don't like "gratuitous abbreviations" either; I tend to type everything
in full. "Thank you", "Welcome back", "May I please...", "Want a hand?"
I tend to do this even under time pressure (although as my main is a
cleric, *usually* there isn't much time pressure - grouped clerics tend
to follow the "hour of boredom followed by fifteen seconds of panic when
you *have* to get *everything* right" model of time pressure).

However, RJB was saying how he couldn't see how it ever saved time; it
does, sometimes, and I can put up with that in the appropriate context.
Unfortunately it's often done in an *inappropriate* context. This bugs
me, but I mainly play in pickup groups(*) and more or less have to live with
it. Whereas d00d sp34k costs both of us time, for no further reason than
to make "him" think he's k3wl and me recognise "him" for the idiot "he" is.

I wish everybody could take the time to type things properly, but I can
recognise that a desire to abbreviate does not automatically make someone
a moron. I'll respect them less for it, but I doubt that they care much,
and complaining loudly is at least as rude. Frankly people who *do* type
everything in full are a vanishingly small minority in my experience.

I suppose clerics don't get asked for random buffs as much as shamans
or druids, so my perspective is perhaps a little different...

Of course, some abbreviations are so worn that even being annoyed at
their use would be silly. I don't think I've ever been asked for a
resurrection, it's always a rez, and usually when looking for a group
I say "44 cleric LFG" rather than "44 cleric looking for group"...
this may be inconsistent, but heck, it's not a black-and-white world.

Oh, and OOM. But that usually falls into the 15 seconds of panic category.
