Not particularly. And frankly if you are in front of me, I'm rooting for 
your wife. =)

Theatre lines move pretty consistently. You're probably saving a bit of 
time, but its not like I'm waiting 40 minutes and your waiting 2.

Besides unless you announce what you are doing I probably wouldn't even 
notice. Ignorance is bliss :)

Again not really, same reasons.

What -does- bug me is people who see people they know and invite them 
into the line. With teens especially this can balloon into 20 people 
rapidly. At the ticket line its no big deal usually from a practical 
standpoint...I'm going to get a ticket, and I'm not likely seeing the 
same movie so it doesn't -really- matter... except in principle.

But then they do it again on opening nights when they form lines to get 
into the theatre after buying a ticket... one guy goes and buys a ticket 
at noon or something and then 'holds a place' in the line for everyone 
he's ever met.

This happens in nightclub lineups too, which bothers the shit out of me. 
Especially since they are manipulating the line length to make 
themselves look busy or popular. (In theory they are managing the in-
outs to maintain legal occupancy for the fire code... but any twit can 
see that in many cases the number of ins significantly exceeds the 
number of outs. So there is no way they are holding the line back 
because they are full.

The VIP line bugs me too. But that's a separate issue ;)

I'm pretty skeptical that he's got a of insider info about the tellers. 
And all it takes is one unpredictable twit to pull out a cheque book to 
stop a line in its tracks. 

Bottom line though is you are 'bucking' the system thats in place and 
he's simply asking you where you are so that he can take his proper 
place in the system. Your probably asking to much to expect a worn out 
grocery shopper to be in the mood to reinvent the queue system at the 
grocery store =)

As to you not committing yourself to a line until the last minute. No 
that doesn't much bother me either. Although I might be the one asking 
you which line you are in.
