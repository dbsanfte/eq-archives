Next time you have a problem like this, petition.  GMs look very
unfavorably on killing quest mobs while they are engaged.  So,  a level
1 can "engage" and "own" a level 60+ quest mob.  

For example, you have the ring and rapier(?) and 52xx gold for Hasten
and are running through the quest dialog with him.  Some Moron walks up
and slaps him, terminating your trade and interfering with your quest,
possibly costing you one or more items.  /petition.  If a GM is on, Some
Moron Gets a warning, logs are checked, you should get your Jboots, or
the items you had in your posession prior to hailing hasten.
