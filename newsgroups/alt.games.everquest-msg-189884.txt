Which would disprove the "top plus one" theory of Taunt.  OTOH, if the mob
did turn towards the warrior, then it would suggest that it had merit
(though not conclusively prove it, since we would still not know if taunting
aggro was greater than stunning agro, or even constant).

So, while it may not be conclusive proof (unless it was proof against the
assumption), it is far from pointless.
