Heard it was *the* place to go, went, wandered around the bloody zone 
for one day and one night.  The druid circle, supposedly 'surrounded by 
spiders', had none when I got there, and the spawn rate was about the 
same (and as random, making for much running around looking in all 
directions) as EC - but the drop rate on silks was *less*!  I headed to 
the newbie area finally and found all of one spider after running around 
most of the night.  So, I give up.  Did I not find the right place to 
farm (I was a little nervous about what else might spawn in there), did 
they change it, or am I *that* unlucky?

Ryou
