Just follow your plan of slowing instead of hasting and I'm sure
you can give new life to the joke.  :-p

I duo'd a little with a Shaman before I abandoned Kaev, and it worked
very well.  Better than duo with Druid, but both Druids I tried turned
out to be idiots while the Shaman was a very solid player, so it isn't
a fair comparison.  Paladin + Druid should be a very effective duo,
but, as with any other duo, bad play easily overwhelms all other
considerations.

I expect that Paladin + Beastlord would be a very strong combination.
