Decent exp for mid 40's?  That would mean low 40's level mobs.  Those
would have between 3700hps to 4300hps.  30% of that is over 1100hps.
Last I checked Ice Comet was a level 49 spell and the biggest nuke a
wizard had at mid 40's was around 625 assuming no resist.

Mid 40's hunting in DL, I can garantee you a mage of the same level
would have outdamage the wizard by several folds.
