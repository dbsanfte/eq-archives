No, he owned up to it after trying to avoid doing so (obviously with good
reason).  If he had seriously wanted to lie about it, he would still be
lying about it and in the guild.  Gives new meaning to "the truth with set
you free" and definitely convinced "Wiggo" to not bother telling the truth
next time, because he knows how that turns out.  =P

As far as pressure to have an app process change, it happens all the time,
constantly.  Some think it's too long, some thing it's too nosy, etc., etc. 
As a leader of a guild, you ignore it, or you decide that it's a valid
change and change the system permanently, you never make exceptions.
