There's one or two that spawn deep in the dungeon and through some locked
doors, I never bothered killing those, just stick to the ones you can find.

Go to Twilight Sea.  If you can't find the elementals there... um... yeah...
anyways, you probably won't even be able to kill half of them before
respawns.  You've also got a chance to spawn the rare/named elementals that
drop some decent loot.
