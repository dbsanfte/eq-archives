Is this true?  I've heard this before from other people, but my druid has
passed 50 in all of his specializations.  At least that is what the little
messages say when I bump up a level in each specialization.  I know
that all of them are at least in the mid fifties right now.  Just wondered
if things have changed, or if I'm missing something.  I don't know which
one actually passed fifty first (I sure hope it wasn't divination).
