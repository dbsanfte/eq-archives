Money is hard to come by at low levels, quests give little real
monetary rewards but it does all add up. Crafting a real money sink at
low levels too. I found it hard to get the cash to buy the materials
and the goods have no real resale value.

My advice would be to work all the quests in each Qeynos zone in turn.
You'll get a fair amount of cash and exp. Once about lvl 15 move out
into Antonica and the BlackBarrow.
