Don't worry about putting points in spell casting skills.  Unlike melee, you
DO NOT have to be in a fight to increase your skill.  Although it's boring,
this is by far the easiest AND cheapest way to increase skill....

...stand around casting the cheapest (mana-wise) spell of each skill until
you max the skill, then mem up the cheapest of the next type & do it again.
