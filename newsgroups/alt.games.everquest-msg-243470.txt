Nothing in this life is fair.. welcome to the real world.

What's fair about rewarding people with more RL money to spend than
you, regardless of game money? But people with RL money can buy gear
for sports, golf equipment, cars, trips, whatever they desire, you
can't. Are you going to toil against the system and wail about how
wrong this is? Tough shit.. that's life. Either accept it or go
insane. 'Fair' is and always will be an subjective term upon which
people will rarely, if ever agree upon.

>Besides that, you can't sell something you don't own

Hah.. watch me. And yeah you can.. even in RL.

>, and the player does not own the account or the plat.

As long as they have control of it.. yeah they 'own' it. Ownership is
a subjective term.. you think you 'own' that house you live in? That
land you live on? You 'own' it? In the case of living in America you
'own' it because there is a military and legal system that will keep
billions of people away from it at the point of a gun and agree that
you 'own' it. But do you really? Not at all. And if its in the best
interests of America.. they can even take it from you under emminent
domain laws. Ownership is just a sign of control.. and he who controls
the item 'owns' it. Until Sony takes direct control over it, sorry..
they don't.
