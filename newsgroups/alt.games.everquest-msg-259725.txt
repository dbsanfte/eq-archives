    Unless you have druids do MGB SotW not just once, but in two consecutive
attempts. :-/ Still didn't get him down last night, but we had 1 wizard and
2 rogues online total. Assuming the DPS decides to stop playing the WoW
stress test we should kill him.

    The main class he drives away is clerics. You need the right 54 if you
want to win.

    Yes. We'd be considered in breach, and be kicked out of the rotation.
Since we're a big guild, we still get use out of Qvic (well, out of
everything except Jewels of Focus).

    For ours, each guild gets two consecutive days for Txevu/Qvic combined.
Kill whatever you can, and then you're done.

    It's a bigger HP/MANA boost than a real piece of loot from Inktu'ta for
a Time-saturated guild. The real reason it's such bad time/reward is the ass
loots, like the low HP one hander and two hander. Those really need to be
retuned or dropped from the table.

    We have a few, and they're all wearing robes! ;-) The Cleave II is an
upgrade until they can get that Cleave III piece, which every melee wants.
And the HPs are an upgrade, aren't they?

    Not the way we have him positioned, and where our non-MT warriors stand.
They'd end up one pillar over, which is one pillar closer to the healers,
which is bad.

    Only has to happen the once to kill us all, and with all the tank
switches....

    I've been in the room when more than four have popped initially. No, it
wasn't pleasant.
