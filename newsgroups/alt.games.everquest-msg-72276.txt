Well, I -have- noticed that my druid isn't quite as hot these days as she
used to be with that stick she carries. And she has wimpy dd spells as well,
as someone else mentioned. I think I just needed to modify the way I was
hunting stuff. I got into a set mode for awhile there, almost a no brainer,
but now I'm getting killed, and some of it is stupid luck, as with the troll
killing the guards in my earlier post, as well as doing stoopid shit myself.
So far, going back to my earlier method that I used with gorge hounds seems
to be working. Guess I should be more adaptable, but it's hard for me to
change after I get a rhythm going. Yeah, and it's damn easy to die to that
same funky rhythm ;-/ I know, kill stuff the best way it can be killed. Not
everything works for every critter.

I'm not much of a grouper, usually. I grouped with a good friend for awhile,
and he and I were working pretty well together for a long time, until he
went to the 'greener fields' of DAoC. I have a problem with myself if
someone dies in my group and it's from something totally stupid that I did.
I hate grouping with people who get me killed, and I know that sometimes I
don't always play/hunt as well as I could. I don't like taking the chance of
getting someone else killed and hearing them mumble "stupid useless druid".

But speaking of HHP, is there any way to solo there, or is it pretty much
all a group thing? I've run through there a number of times, and I can't
recall ever seeing anyone killing stuff alone.

thanks for the input!
