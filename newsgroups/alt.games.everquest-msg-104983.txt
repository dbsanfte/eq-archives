Everfrost is not a particularly high density PC Zone.  Kiting CAN be done
anywhere just so long as you have the skill not to train another player.

Seems Ol Ben is not particularly Druid-friendly. On my server he'd be doing a
lot a walking. Either that or he wa jsut having a bad day.

Someone steals your MoB? Get it's Hps below 50 percent pronto, and say thank
you to the Ks'ers as you chalk up the experience as they finish it off.

If if happens more than once, and they are disrespectful? Petition or report
them, and keep about your business.
