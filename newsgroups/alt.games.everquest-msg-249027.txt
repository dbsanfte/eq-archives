Oh, I so wish... but no. The first thing that will happen is the
primary devs and artists will be pulled off EQ2 to work on another
project.

Next, the game will settle down into "maintenance mode" where the goal
is to reduce costs and increase margins. This will involve laying off
as many GMs as SOE thinks they can get away with.

It's not that the PEOPLE INVOLVED aren't good and want to be there for
the community, it's that SOE has made their plan quite clear with EQ:
get the money, turn it into a subscription magazine service and pump a
new game out before the player base all quit.

Remember when they promised that Legends wouldn't affect the number of
GM events on regular servers? Ever seen a GM event since (real GM
events, not night-spawning special events that had no human element)?

Oh it's easy, but this is a family newsgroup ;-)

Please, please, please someone as SOE read the above!

Thanks for stating it so clearly!

I just wish that SOE would put EQ on the list of games that need to
win. They keep patching the game in ways that make it seem like they
want to retain the player base long-term, but then they ignore that
same player base (recent protestations not withstanding).
