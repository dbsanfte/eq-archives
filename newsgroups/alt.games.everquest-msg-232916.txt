XP home does just fine with this sort of networking.  Just don't try
and stuff it into a domain..

Of course it does.  If you don't find it under Start -> Programs ->
Accessories, then just go to Start -> run and type "cmd"

Sounds to me like the OP's eth card never woke up from that original
Sleep.  I'd suggest shutting down the XP machine (not reboot, but
shutdown), then fire it back up and see if that doesn't get it going
