Most answers I saw contained a "what? really?? I never 
even noticed that..." reply.  If they don't notice it, 
it isn't bothering them.  How do they respond to 
something that isn't even coming to their attention?

> White lettering on white background

I usually get a friend who knows Japanese to help me 
out.  Many people who watch subtitled stuff watch enough 
that they can figure out what's being said anyway, so no 
great loss.  Also, if the movie is ANY good, one or two 
lines lost to a dark background is NOT going to kill the 
entire plot for you.  Well, no.  I mean not going to for 
me.

No worse than hearing the lousy voices dubs usually put 
in, and usually far less distracting.

Again, many times the people watching are educated 
enough to have a guess at what was said, of if they're 
not, they have been paying enough attention to the rest 
of the film that they can take a wild guess.  If not, 
well, you've missed a line.

Why are you so determined to make people that prefer 
something different than you look like snobs?  You asked 
people why they preferred something different than you.  
They answered.  You claimed they didn't answer, then 
said their answers made them 'high kultur' snobs.

I'm not saying those people DON'T exist (I've seen 
enough of them) but I've not seen many answers that seem 
that way to me in this thread.  Believe me, anybody 
watching subtitles to sound 'kultured' would be a LOT 
more obvious about it.

For you, yes.  For him, apparently not.  So what?  He 
isn't forcing *you* to watch it twice.

I, personally, LOVE reading.  I keep all my books.  My 
room is starting to explode because I can't throw them 
away.  I've bought multiple copies of several books 
because they fall apart from over-use.  Does that mean 
I'm 'working'?  No.  I'm re-reading something that was 
so enjoyable the first time, I want to experience it 
again.  Do you play EQ just once?  Or as just one 
race/class?

Not sure what this has to do with subtitles vs dubbed...

> Also, some movies do OK with subtitles. Il Postino worked.

Okay, good.  Now remember, all this started because you 
questioned someone's preference for *one specific movie* 
as subtitled, not dubbed.

I challenge you again to go find Kodomo no Omocha and 
take it all in the first time.  I had to watch it 3 
times to get in all the dialogue *and* the action.  
Fortunately, I was so entertained, I didn't notice I was 
bored the whole time.

Which, yes, sucks.  BAD subtitles suck.  But we're 
talking subtitles in general.  I don't like McDonalds 
hamburgers too much, but I do like hamburgers in 
general.
