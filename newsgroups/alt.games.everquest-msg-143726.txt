As for what the others have said, "Bravo, and good Info."  I, too, am a 
lvl 16 Rogue, and have had the good graces to join with almost all GOOD 
groups (and one or two GREAT ones!).  Yet, I've felt the pain of an 
either inexperienced group of individuals, clueless morons, or just poor 
players.  For the most part, don't fear or loathe grouping...learn from 
the bad MORE than from the good.  And, if you find yourself in a group 
that is, well, nothing but whiners and losers, bow out gracefully - WHILE 
THERE IS NO COMBAT GOING ON - and leave.  The very worst group I was in 
wouldn't even acknowledge that I had said I was leaving, nor the 
contributions of the two of us that were actually killing stuff, so I did 
a sneak-hide, hung around a few minutes for some XP, and then left for 
another zone..didn't say anything else, just left.

Some people are boneheads, but when you find that ONE great group, you'll 
know it!  

Oh, and make sure to hash out the looting schedule BEFORE fighting 
starts.

Just my opinion, anyway.

Balanof (aka Michael)
