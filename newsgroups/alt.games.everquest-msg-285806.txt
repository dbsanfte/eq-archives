Not necesarily.  Cancel Magic will remove your buffs from the first slot in
order to the last slot.  Therefore, if you are expecting a debuff such 
as malo,
you can arrange to keep your number one buff slot open, when Malo lands, a
single shot of Cancel Magic will probably clear it for you and leave all 
  your buffs intact.

I say probably, because it seems buffs have a chance to resist being 
removed, and the cancel will somehow float down the list trying buff 
after buff till it finds one that fails the resist, thus, sometimes malo 
stays and you remove whatever is in buff slot two or three or even a 
later one.

Big problem with this strategy is that there are quite a few short term 
buffs, procs, HoTs, long duration bard songs, and so on, that you may 
end up getting hit with, it can be a pain to keep slot one (or two or 
three or whatever) open for Malo to land in

In addition to the cure types listed, some debuffs can only be cured by 
remove curse, and I believe that with TSS yet another type of debuff was 
introduced, although I haven't played in TSS so I'm not sure about that.
