North to South Carolina?! Oh, nonono. The South starts somewhere around
Richmond, Virginia. 'Course, I'm basing this on the idea that the South is more
of a mindset and culture than a geographical entity. But right around Richmond
you can start finding grits and sweet tea with much greater ease, and...
well... the people become "southern" (if you've experienced it, you'd know what
I mean. If not, I doubt I could explain). By this definition, California is
absolutely northern.
