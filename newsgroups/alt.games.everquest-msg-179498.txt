This is a poor example.  Why not go for the gold with Slipknot
(Heretic's Anthem)?  Saber could probably do a better job than I on
this subject :-)  He could probably also argue much better than I how
most metal isn't satanic, but rather rebellious against mainstream
society and trying to put across a point.  Think of Eminem with a
buttload of guitar and sometimes incoherent yelling.
