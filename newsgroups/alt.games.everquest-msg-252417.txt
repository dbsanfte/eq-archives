Not really, if you want to argue a breaking of the rules.. than it is
up to SOE to enforce, and you report them. Enforcement does not
consist of offering someone $3,000, taking all the items out of the
house, burning it down, and then taking back the $3,000. Only morons
think this vigilante method of justice is in any way justified. Its
like two guys at a poker table.. one cheats, the other shoots him. And
what often happened was murder charges and a hanging. The plain truth
is that justice was never reconciled through the commission of a
crime, you only ever have more crime.
