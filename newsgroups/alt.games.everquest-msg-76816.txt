its not anywhere near selos. Most of the horses won't even match 55
sow. In fact so far, my druid with 55 sow has lapped EVERY horse its
ever seen anyone on. In fact when ever I see a horse running I
purposefully try to pass it and so far not a single horse has ever
been close to my speed. I'd imagine the bulk of horses I pass are
lower ones. I've never raced a 100 k horse, but I'm betting if I did I
could make its owner cry ;)
