You get what you pay for.  If you want service then go to a place that 
has service.  If you want cheap then go to Best Buy, WalMart, etc.

Was looking for a TV the other day.

They do have a problem of some sort in that regard.  CrapUSA used to do 
the same thing--rather ridiculous when there is nothing between the 
registers and the door except a Coke machine.  With Best Buy, since they 
can handle the transaction somewhere besides the registers in front it 
does make sense--you could buy a $60 DVD player to get a receipt and 
then walk out with a 50" flat-screen--but they really need to find a 
better way to deal with it.
