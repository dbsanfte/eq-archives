Minor Illusion is a very fun spell to play with.

Back in the days when you could drop coins on the ground, a favorite trick
was to drop a copper piece outside the local Bank, then cast Minor Illusion
until you looked like a coin on the ground.

Then you'd watch as folk would come by and try to pick you up.

It was also fun while disguised as a coin to spin on the ground, and watch
people's reactions.
