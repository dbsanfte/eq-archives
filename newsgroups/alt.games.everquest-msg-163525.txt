PnP RPGs are not played real time though. If a dungeon master said
I had to sit in a corner staring at my player's handbook for 10 minutes
and meditate I'd tell him where he could stick his dungeon master's guide.

Studying spells and resting in a PnP D&D game took all of 10 seconds
in real time. Player: "Ok DM we stop at the inn and rest for the night."
DM:<rolls for vampire night encounters> "Ok in the morning you..."

The error was absolutely in the design. It should have never even made
it past testing. Its stupid. It would be right up there with making players
empty their bladders and bowels and requiring the characters sleep
real time.
