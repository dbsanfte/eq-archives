Actually, I'm using Verizon as my DSL supporter.  I only use my AOL account for
e-mail out of pure bad habit :P and also because the rest of my family uses the
same AOL account for e-mail as well.

Dan, the computer I'm trying to play EQ on is the main computer in my network
router set-up and it has a firewall.  Do you think this could be the problem?
