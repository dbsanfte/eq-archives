I've always been partial to the gazebo in Unrest where there are three
static spawns and several wanderers.

I think a necro wedding in the Temple of Marr or Rodcet Nife would be
very high on the danger list, and pretty as well. A necro wedding in PoG
would also be spiff.

The base of the waterfall in Siren's Grotto is gorgeous, and deadly.
