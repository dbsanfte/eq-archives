I have the following on my account:
37 Monk
32 Bard

Monk:
1. Feign Death pulling
1. Adds a LOT of damage to any group
2. Not Gear Dependant (cheapest character to outfit)

Bard:
1. *Force multiplier.

*A well played Bard will make every other member of the group better.
Haste, Mana Song, Resist Buffs, Damage Shields, etc, etc, etc

I love both of them equally, but the Bard is killing my hands and
wrists heheh. If I had to pick one for your group, I would go with the
Monk. 

Why? ....Unless the player behind the Bard is 110% committed to the
class, he will most likely burn out at some point from all the work.

Cheers
