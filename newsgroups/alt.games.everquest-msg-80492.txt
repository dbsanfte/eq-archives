Thanks Andy, I appreciate it. And I did get the message, both from all the
helpful people here and from the GM at Verant about killing guards. And I
learned another valuable lesson (which at my RL age, I think I shoulda
learned before this) and that is to keep my mouth shut when I see people
doing stupid things. I've had people train me as much as other folks here
and I've never said anything to the trainer, though I badly wanted to. I've
had people ks from me and never said anything. I've never had the slightest
bad word, even in the form of a mild argument ingame. And I still don't know
why I did that night... not that, I suppose, it means anything now in any
case.
