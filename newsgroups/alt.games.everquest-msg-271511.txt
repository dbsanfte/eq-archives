So where do y'all think is the nicest place to have a home in Norrath?

Some of the villages are charming. Are all of the basic rooms as stark as 
the bare wood in a basic Castleview room?

I've also noticed that some of the high rent areas still don't have very 
nice floors and walls. For example, much of the wood in N. Qeynos is still 
kinda ratty. Of course, I haven't looked at any of the private rooms. Maybe 
they are plastered or painted.

Is it possible to stick your head in a room and look around? It says you 
have to pay rent but I'm still on my free week. What if I entered a room but 
then changed back? Would that keep me at my old rate without losing my free 
days?

Where have you moved to impress your friends and visitors? Anybody want to 
post their homes open for visiting on Antonia Bayle?
