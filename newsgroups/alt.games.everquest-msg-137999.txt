Few months back, well before the new UI, a feature was added to
separate melee hits off into their own window - one for my hits, one
for my being hit, and one for others' hits. People didn't like the new
UI not allowing the hits to be separated out like that (they could be
separated off from main chat still, but all went into one window).

What I don't like about its "return" is the fact that, if I want all
melee in one window, I have to filter it into that window piece by
piece instead of being able to just click once to have it all go
there.
