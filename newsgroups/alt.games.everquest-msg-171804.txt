Hi all,

tried to find a list of weapons and items for bards that act
additionally as an instrument. No luck at all, not on the wellknown
generalsites nor on the classpecific sites.

Does anyone know a link / list he could send me as I am very
interested in these items ? ;-)

Thanks in advance, a good start into the new year to all

Christian
