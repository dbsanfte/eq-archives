Here are the basic concepts I believe God wants you to know, he told me to
summarize them right now at my own peril.

1) Wants Christian sanctuary to form on West side of U.S. (Washington,
Oregon, California, Nevada) Basically if you are a Christian and you don't
want to deal with as much hassle about it then I would come here.

2) Does not want a civil war, just a safe zone

3) Intends to institute Theocracy with apostles, prophets, teachers, etc.
