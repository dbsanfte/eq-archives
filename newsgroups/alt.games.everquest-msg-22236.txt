Depends on what they like, how often/long they play, and whether they
expect to play in the post-45 game.  And most importantly, are they
planning to only play together, or duo sometimes and start/find groups
sometimes.

For duoing, anyone with damage output (be it a nuker or a melee) with
anyone with healing (preferred druid or shaman for their utility spells)
works well.  There may be some pairs that are somewhat better than others,
but it's far outweighed by what's fun for both players.

I'd stay away from cleric or enchanter if they're not going to group
much.  Both of these classes lose much of their power if they don't have
a group that they can turn into an unstoppable killing machine.  A Druid
would have more flexibility than a cleric when in duo or small group, and a
mage, necro, or wizard will have more firepower than an enchanter when
fighting mostly singles.

The only other advice is try not to overlap abilities.  If one of them
is playing a druid, then a warrior would be a better choice than a
ranger for a melee partner.  Likewise 2 wizards won't be as effective as
a wizard and a shaman.  2 Bards might be interesting though...

On a related note, I have some friends that have talked about starting 6
bards that always group together.  Since many bard songs stack, this
could be very powerful, or just silly.
