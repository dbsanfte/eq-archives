The thing that apears to be spell effects is the sleeping Dragon. He's just
a collection of particles which form a translucent dragon.   We've played
with him on Fennin too.  You can hit him while he sleeps and he'll stand up
and fall right back down without taking any damage, and cannot be killed in
this form.  Seeing as how his sleeping and standing form was present in the
guild's screens shots, they obviously had the patch installed.  Then when he
woke up, he was a human, while his sleeping self, was still present as well.
If the zone was fully working, as was stated, when the sleeper awoke, his
sleeping carcas shouldn't be just hanging around.  And seeing as how the
sleeper model is in fact present in the screenshots, there's no reason for
Kerafyrm to be using the default naked male human model.  I think that that
one screenshot alone is enough to discredit verant in this case.
