The reason the burnished wooden stave crits is because you aren't clicking
on an item when the damage hits.  That's the check that's made to see
whether a DD crits or not.

You can easily test this by casting rain spells and instantly clicking on
your velk boots.  You will *never* crit a rain while the boots are going.
