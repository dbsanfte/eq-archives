This actually isn't the first time this has happened.  I remember the
brigands and bandits in WK being bugged and requiring a entire slew of
people in their 20s to kill because they had enormous hit point totals
and disgusting regen.  Got the GM in and he ended up permakilling them
until they could be fixed.

I believe it happened when they were adding the new epic NPCs to WK. 
Perhaps with LoY, they're fiddling with SK and the same thing's
happening again.
