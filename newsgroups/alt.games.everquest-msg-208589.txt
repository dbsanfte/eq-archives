Also, those no int leggings had a lot of +mana.  I picked a random level 65
Wizard at Afterlife's site and checked his equipment.  His leggings had +5
int, +85 mana, and he's at the int cap of 355.

If he got those leggings, his int would very likely *still* be at 355, and
his mana would be way up (unless he's at a cap there, too!).
