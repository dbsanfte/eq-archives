So I am a Vah Shir Rogue, I am level 15, and I am on Xev.

No one will group with me in Paludal, everyone there wants bandit groups.
OK!

No one will group with me in Hollowshade, everyone there is a Beastlord who
will just solo. OK!

I cannot solo at all. OK!

See, if only one of these were true, the "OK!" would work. But they are all
true and so I am sad. :(
