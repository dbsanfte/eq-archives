Jump on his camp and take it.  There is no justifiable reason for someone to
camp a mob for that long of time.  Obviously the item is not needed by him
and all he wants to do is be a gready SOB.  Be sure not to kill steal from
him because that is indeed a no no with the GMs but if you can hit the mob
first it is all yours.
