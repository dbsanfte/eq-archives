   Depends what you mean by "many" of course.  But this is a very looked forward
to beta (why do I get the feeling that I'm using some seriously messed up
grammar?).  If you spend time on any of the EQII forums, you might find yourself
adjusting exactly what "many" means to you.

   I would certainly agree with the first statement.  And I lean towards the
second as well.  But only because "tacky" does not equal "unethical".  Yes, SOE
is a business, and yes, a business is in the business of making money.  But to
me this just pushes the "Give us your money!" mantra that seems to be the
driving force behind many of SOE's policies.  This fact is reinforced to my by
the recent, and to my way of thinking, exorbitant prices for doing non-naked
character transfers.
