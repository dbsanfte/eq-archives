What class? several different options but need to know what class hehe.
necro/sk fairly obvious, never got my necro past 25 but found if i needed to
break up mobs i could fear one let the other come at me run off with one
after myself to a safer spot, fd and fear would break on the other with the
mem wipe.. easy split if you have a bit of working room to get out of the
feared ones agro range and snare/fear the pulled one without it's pathing
right back to the other mob. sk it would be far easier i imagine since the
hp for error and can fd split a little more cleanly.
Cleric? not to often i fear kited with my cleric but not much probs breaking
spawns with one with the use of lull line, roots and atone and occasionally
the same as the necro method but instead of fd i'd scoot off the the pulled
one root it and atone it then go back to slaughter the previously feared mob
(only if i couldn't get a single pull using my lull line).
