Well, you only have to put it on the top if you summarize or don't include 
the entire original.  If you're the type of person who is going to quote 
the entire post (and there are times when this is a good thing) I think 
it's acceptable to top-post.   I don't put much faith in RFCs that don't 
use the SHALL, MAY, MUST verbage that I'm used to.  If you leave it open 
to interpretation, it will be interpreted.  :)
I really read this as:  

You should summarize previous posts, and then post your information below.  
If you don't summarize, I guess you can post anywhere.  

Where I to rewrite it it would look more like this:

When sending a reply to a message the poster shall either summarize the 
previous postings or include enough of the previous posting that the mean 
and references are clear.  When summarizing previous posts, the poster 
shall place new text directly below the summary.  When leaving previous 
posting for context, the poster shall intersperse new text with the 
relevant reference section.  The poster shall not top-post, unless it is 
to add a me-to comment, so that all other readers can easily see that the 
poster is an idiot.
