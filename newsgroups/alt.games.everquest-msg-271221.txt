I'm guessing that's supposed to be a 'bad thing.' I once moved out of a 
house because it had a bat in it. If there's one there's going to be 
another, and I just can't abide bats lol.

Our company requires us to travel and have a nationwide dial-up service 
and they picked AOL. They used it for just about a year and our constant 
kvetching about the poor service (slow connects, frequent disconnects, 
and such) resulted in us going to earthlink and I haven't heard anybody 
complain except the two who are stuck with AOL because their 'home town' 
doesn't offer earthlink. HAHA to them! :)

I'd always assumed most AOL kvetching was just ppl jumping on the 
bandwagon because AOL (along with MS) was an easy target and folks just 
liked complaining about them. After having to use them I've realized 
most of the kvetching isn't strong enough hehehe. Congrats on good 
service and being happy with them though. They've got to be doing 
SOMETHING right, loads of people use them and keep using them.
