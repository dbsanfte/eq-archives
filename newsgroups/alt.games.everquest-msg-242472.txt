People camping at zone lines can expect trains, but pulling a train right
through a zone (especially a pop zone), is pretty ignorant IMO.

Anyone can hand in parchments to any other class's hand in guy, you could
still of rolled, if he won then hand in to his guy.

Was your group dead? Do you not have Evac?  My wizard is only 46 but I would
of either evac'd  or nuked until dead, running from a group when they are
still fighting is wrong IMO. Besides which, after hailing mauvin why not
just evac from his room? :)

Yep you need a fair amount of dps for the execution trial, nothing excessive
really though.

A horse is probably the best upgrade for the price for outdoor zones, it
makes a surprising difference.

Nice, very good spell for wizards :) I think most get it late as the quest
is a bit of a pain at 39 :p Not sure it would have a great deal of use in
the exectution trial though.
