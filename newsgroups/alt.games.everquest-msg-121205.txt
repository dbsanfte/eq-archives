I wonder how many quest items from PoA would even be worn now (by the
average player able to clear PoA repeatedly.. a lot)   the only real
exception I can think of is the rare ranger cloak.

One thing I don't think is fair - the monkey quest one, 50% haste right
click (nice) 3 charges.. lame.  Ranger equivalent - 50% right click haste,
unlimited charges.  wtf?
