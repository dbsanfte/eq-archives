I'll trade ports for rez.

I always need to heal myself.  My pets occasionally need healing also.

I also die.  A lot.  Bad charm breaks, unlucky stuns, training myself,
getting gangraped by greens (h8 Grieg's End)... etc.  I've taken 3 unrezzed
deaths so far this weekend (one still might get rezzed, 2 are gone though),
one 96% rez otherwise.  At 6% per death, it's annoying (am 41% into 63) but
I can make 20% of my level in about 75 minutes, depending on the status of
the crapshoot that is the loroks of PoStorms.

I want to beat the wizards soloing loroks irl.  They'd be just as good off
doing the nophtans at the zone in, but they're killing my potential pets.
Although, my preferred setup is to grab a lorok for a pet, and then have
someone else who keeps the rest dead, I get the same exp off the trees and
bears as I get off the frogs, but less people hunt them (one type of
tree/bear summons and is pure melee, the bears flurry, the other type of
tree/bear is a druid and doesn't summon, in fact, the druid ones barely even
melee, they just chain cast spells that are relatively wimpy compared to the
melee they could be doing.... hmm... melee for 600 every half second or nuke
for 700 every 6 seconds....)

BTW, for Cel, I got a buttload of upgrades this weekend.  Mask of the
Hailstorms, ND1 and went from my crappy stat FT2 belt back to my stat-heavy
Girdle of Mithaniel.  Anyways... self buffed with Pot9 I have 2933 hp (2891
if I'm using mage focus ring, which is a HUGE help when using Command of
Tunare).  264 wis (270 cap), 186 sta, 16 standing mana regen (5 FT, Pot9 and
MotS).  Whee!
