My first real character never learned sense heading till around level 40 (the
slow, untwinked, unPL'd, don't know what I'm doing way, not 40 in 2 weeks like I
could probably do now) without ever using it.  Why?  Because it goes up very
slowly and is almost entirely useless.  I have a good sense of direction, and I
figured out some tricks.: drop a sword on the ground and it always points north,
wind always blows from east to west...  Then I dumped a ton of (otherwise
useless) training points in and got up past 50, and used it dilligently, past
100 it was sort of kinda useful after all... and it went up much faster past 50
skill.

My next alt bought a compass.  Very reliable, much easier than dropping a sword.

When I started over as a dwarf cleric, though, I found that sense heading was
remarkably improved.  Being born with a 50 skill will do that for you!

It wasn't till my alt after that, though, that I managed (with help from this
newsgroup) to figure out how to tie sense heading (or any other button I like)
to the left/right arrows.  Now all my alts max this skill out very quickly
indeed.

Further, it was still of only marginal usefulness until quite recently, when the
compass was introduced.  Rock steady and much more nuanced than the old sense
heading messages; now sense heading is only useful at low skill levels (where a
success steadies the compass for a bit) and to be ignored except that it
generates skill ups on the way to 200.

With the compass, my navigational skills have improved markedly, now rather than
having to follow landmarks and zone edges, I can often take cross zone
shortcuts, chopping my travel time in half.
