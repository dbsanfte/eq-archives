400 DPS sustainable for ~2 minutes.
200+ DPS sustainable indefinitely.  Less downtime actually works in my
favor.

I've cast mala *only* (zero damage, very low aggro) without even having
a pet up, while solo, on a raid and gotten exp.  Welcome to spaghetti code. 
Back before /raid eliminated the joy of trying to be Team KS, I learned of

things.  :)
