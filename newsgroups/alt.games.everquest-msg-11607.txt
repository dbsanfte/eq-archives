No Wis over 200 does not help you very much if at all.

However your formula is a little off.

(WIS / 5) * level plus some other factors that I'm sure others in the group will
be more than happy to help you with.  I would suggest going to Allakhazam and
using the mana calculator there to better understand your Wis:Mana ratio.
