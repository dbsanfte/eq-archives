Well, cost does have something to do with it, as long term, losing money on
each and every customer is hardly sustainable.  I do realize there are many
other factors as well however, but, bottom line is, if the cost increases,
and the fees charged don't cover it, then the price has to go up, or the
service has to stop at some point, unless it is being subsidized by some
other part of the business.
