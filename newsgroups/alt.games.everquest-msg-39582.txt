Not quite but nearly. Seeing str,dex,sta,agi all at 255 on a raid the
other night, with still some obvious upgrades needed, and with AC a
couple of points shy of 1400. I'll be using it at times where the extra
raw AC will push me over the next 'step' when I'm MTing, swapping in
smoething else all other times

Agi relates to damage avoidance. Raw AC relates to damage mitigation.
Trust me, L75 dragons usually hit the target

Yup. I wanna be like them. You know where they live? I wanna root
through their trash and send them letters from cut up pieces of
newspaper!

Got a link to the profile? I haven't been there for a while and wouldn't
mind seeing if there are any other things I'm missing/copying
