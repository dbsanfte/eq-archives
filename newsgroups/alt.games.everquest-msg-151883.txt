Not just nukes but the best nukes in the game.
No one can burn down a mob faster than a wizard.

Teleport Spells.
Plane teleport spells. No one else gets these.

Wizards are in high demand in the later levels.

Can Quad kite solo, fastest solo leveling method in
the game.

Difficult to play as your first class.
You must understand the game mechanics very
well and understand agro and how to control it.

Uhhhh. kiting at level one is not a good
idea. 14 is when you can kite decently.
However, you don't want to kite at the lower levels
using the porcupine method is much more efficient
and you build up you defence skill.

Can Quad kite solo, fastest solo leveling method in
the game.

You don't get mana regen until level 54 self
and 59-60 to cast on others.

Druids also get nukes. Not as good as the wizards
but they are respectable.

Teleport spells.

>   Cons

Druid is the jack of all trades but master of none.
Druids can melee a little at the lower levels (I meleed
most of my battles all the way to level 40) but not as good
as any tank, melee or hybrid class, they can heal decently but not
as good as a Cleric, the have decent nukes but not as good
as a Wizard or Mage, They have teleport spells but none to
the planes, They have DoTs but not as good as Shaman
or Necros, They have tracking but not as good as Rangers.

When ever friends start playing EQ I always recommend starting
as a Druid since you get a taste of just about everything. Then
choose a different class if they wish.
