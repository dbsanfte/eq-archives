In PA and NJ, and many other states, driving in the left hand lane at 
speeds matching or lower than that of people in the lane to your right 
is illegal.  The fact that someone could pass you on the right isn't a 
defense in states like this, which is, I think, what Biz meant by "in 
the right lane"; not "in the right hand lane" but "in the correct (ie 
not far left) lane"

Then again, it was a tiny bit cryptic, and since I don't know which 
state he's posting from nor what their laws are, he might have been 
referring to some other lane or some other law entirely.
