You type "/gu Ragefile!" and your guild raid immediately evacs to Skyfire
to help.  They don't even finish they fight they are currently in the middle
of.  It's not as important as getting the Cleric epic.  (Well, if they are
going for a game-wide first, then they stay...but guilds that can do
game-wide firsts have Clerics that don't need the whole guild to come and
help with Ragefire :-)).
