> couple of fights I managed to catch agro and well being a ranger it hurt.

Assuming you mean Kael, the thing that caught me out most was not
understanding ENGRAGE. ENRAGE = Auto-Riposte and was pretty much instant
death for my Ranger - yes, the mob will get an automatic riposte on *every*
hit you land, so if you are fast and dual-wielding, look out! I was told
after about the 4th time that if you se a mob ENRAGE you should (a)
immediately come off auto-attack and (b) get behind the mob because
auto-riposte only works if you are standing in front.
