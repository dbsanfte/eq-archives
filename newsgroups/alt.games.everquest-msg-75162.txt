Well, it is in their best interest to sell the more expensive one.  It is
certainly possible that the differences between the Ti200 and Ti500 are
minimal, and that possibly the Ti200 can be clocked at the same speed as the
Ti500, OTOH, it is also possible that there is more to it than that.  I
certainly can't tell one way or the other based on the website alone.
