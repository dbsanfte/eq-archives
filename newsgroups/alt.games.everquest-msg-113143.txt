IMHO there is something about druids. I have seen the same thing many times.
I dunnno
if its because a certain type of player elects to play druid or whatever,
but ive been ignored
plenty of times.

I try to counterreact when Im on my own druid, doing "drive by" sowing and
shit. But im
afraid its not enough to make the other druids realize the error of the
arrogance.
