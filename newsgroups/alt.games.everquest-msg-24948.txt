Our guild on Brell went through the same situation. We had people from 10 to
60 , we went through a big shakedown raised our minimum level to 40 and
eventually (now) we have a large group of people from the 45 to 55 range. We
have lowered our recruiting level back to 20 but now we seem to be getting
people 35 and up applying. Your guild has to decide what it wants as far as
levels, the "casual family thing" wears very thin very fast once people get
to a level to do stuff. You can either decide to stay a low/mid level guild
and resign yourself to losing everyone that levels above that or you can
raise level limits and try to get more higher levels. It took us several
months to get back in good shape.
