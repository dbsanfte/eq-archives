The individual DoTs don't stack, but if your Necros can keep it straight as
to who casts what, they can each slap a DoT on the mob right off, probably
without getting themselves killed.  One Necro who casts every dot he can on
a mob at the start of a fight will probably be dead around halfway through
if the monster gets hold of him.  (DoTs apparently generate a lot of points
on the hate list.)  Also, pets are completely stackable in the situations
where they can be used.  And in a large raid, you can have "surplus" Necros
play mana-battery.  It may not be their first choice (that would probably
be to solo Vox and win,) but it *is* something useful they can do if there
is no way they can do anything else.
