your are right. I thought about this too when I saw Legolas kill with one
arrow. A bow should be a one off kill weapon. I've never read or heard about
roman legionairs that are still walking with 27 arrows in their chest.
Technically though, a ranger can kill with one arrow already. Granted the
mobs are of very low level, compared to the ranger in question, but it can
be done frequently and easily. Just take your Shaped compound darkwood and
8dmg arrows and start picking off orc pawns. No challenge really.

I also always thought that getting your archery skill up is far to time
consuming as opposed to other combat skills. This too turns out to be
untrue. Last night, I spent lobbing 600 arrows at mobs from a very nice
group that let me target practice. Mobs in my level range, they never
touched me and I got 18 increases. Another myth shattered as far as I'm
concerned.

I do still feel however that it is a bit unfair that rangers have to pay for
their crits. There should be a reliable and free way of getting an unlimited
amount of fairly decent arrows earlier in the game. Tolans darkwood bracer
kicks in at 47, nice. Alternate advancement kicks in around 52(?) even
nicer. But in the mean time, you're stuck. I would like to see a line of
spells or questable items suitable for rangers between lvl 1 and 52 that
summon  1, 2, 3 or more damage arrows.
