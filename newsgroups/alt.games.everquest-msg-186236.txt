A good case for making fast and easy travel available to twinks.

My best solution for that is creating "porting NPCs" that charge
for the service.

True Newbies (tm) who should be encouraged to explore the world
won't be tempted by free travel and twinks can still zip around
the world in the blink of an eye.

I think you're exaggerating the case.

Okay, I don't have a good solution for experienced players who
decide to start a non-twink.  My best offer is teleporting pads
that you must reach on foot at least once before you can use them
as a destination from other teleport pads.

That requires you hoof it at least once.

Now I think you're *drastically* overstating the case.
