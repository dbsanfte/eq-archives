This has happened to me.  Except that my system locked while I was
zoning from Dagnor's to BB.  When I restarted the system and logged in,
it said welcome to Butcherblock.  Then I got hit for 10000 damage and
got hurt by non melee a few times.  I petitioned.  While waiting for a
response I looked for my body at the zone line.  Found nothing.  When
the GM came and I explained what happened, I got an xp cr rez and was
summoned to my body.  It was way up on a hill/cliff right next to the
entrance to Kaladim.  I figure I musta fallen from the top of the sky or
something.  Hasn't happened any other time, though.
