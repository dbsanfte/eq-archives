SK's are one of the most rare characters in the game, at high end.. but
anyway, just to show how off the mark your comment was :)

Heres my guilds monk roster, its kindof out-of-date so some people may be
missing from it, but you should get the idea heh........  were not known as
"the monk guild" for nothing :P

Thats what warriors with taunt are for... anyway depending where we are..
the monks usually deal with adds infight (ie if were fighting Aary in NToV,
any shitbirds that add will be engaged by monks)

If were fighting RC in umbral, all skeles, assasins, rock things etc that
add, are all handled by our "monk crew"

Btw I do actually have a SK
