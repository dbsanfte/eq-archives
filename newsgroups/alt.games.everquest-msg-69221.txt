 And what will they hunt there? If they whack orcs they will take
negative hits with Indigo Brotherhood in Neriak. I'm not quite sure why
an evil would trash good faction in Neriak just to gain a few easy
levels that couldn't be gained elsewhere. Coffins are now sold on Luclin
so maybe Neriak faction is not as important as it once was. I still
wouldn't waste my time on Faydwer though regardless.
