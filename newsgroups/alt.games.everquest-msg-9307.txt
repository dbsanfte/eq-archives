That's probably as specific as it gets, as from a magician's perspective
paladin would rank below quite a few other classes as wanted partner.

1. Necro
2. Another magician
3. Enchanter
4. Bard
5. Cleric
6. Shaman
7. Druid
8. Shadowknight
9. Ranger
10. Monk
11. Paladin
12. Warrior
13. Rogue

Wow, now that I think about it paladin ranks way down there.  They're
alright partners, buffs and heals are never bad, but they don't add as much
as other classes do to the pair.  The arrangement above changes around some
depending on need, but paladin will always fall below enchanters, druids,
necros, shamans and bards unless I _really_ need a puller type.  And if I
_really_ need a puller type, I'd prefer ranger/monk/sk over paladin for,
respectively, sow/track/snare, feign, feign/snare.
