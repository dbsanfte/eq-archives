I have to Shaman which I have an easy time soloing. Shamans are regarded as
one of the best classes for soloing 51+ mobs but I have yet to see that
because I am only level 46. At level 45 (Hell level) I was able to get a
yellow of exp every 2 hours in Overthere soloing which was faster than a
chain pulling group in Dreadlands. Shamans don't really become a powerfull
solo class until level 34 when they get there pet. With a Jaundice bone
bracer shamans really have an easy time soloing. A 263 point manaless DD
spells really helps :)
