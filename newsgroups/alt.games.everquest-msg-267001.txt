Where?  It's all over the west coast.  Checking at Gamestop.com's store
availability form, trying Seattle, San Jose, Pasadena, and a small town in
central California, asking for all stores within 200 miles, most of them
have several copies.

Spot checking a few other cities around the country, same goes for Chicago,
Atlanta, New York, New Orleans, Dallas, and Denver.

So, it looks like it is actually a pretty easy game to get...sounds like
there is just a local distribution problem hitting your area. :-(
