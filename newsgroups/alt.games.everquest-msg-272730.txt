Disappointed?  Hardly.  However, this does show some colors.

Y'see, there's no really new content here.  Their advertising points are:

Guild bank.
Guild hall.
In game email.
Barter system.
Mass corpse summoning.
The ability to wield potions from a 'bandolier'.

You have to do a little digging to find anything about new zones, and when
you do it's almost as if it's an afterthought.  25 bucks for this?

This 'expansion' could easily have been done for free as a series of
patches.  They've given this type of funtionality before as patches.  For
example, I see no real difference between the ability to mass summon corpses
and the implementation of soulbinders.  Soulbinders, IIRC, came as part of a
patch.

There's no one thing here that's as all encompassing as the graphics update,
and that was a patch.  Remember back in the day when they actually gave away
free zones like The Warrens, Stonebrunt, and Veksar?

Now, I realize it's not a philanthropy ... they're in business to make
money.  It's just become quite apparent that they're going to squeeze the
goose for as long as they get anything resembling gold out of it.

That's what bean counters do, and that's just about all they have left on
the EQLive side of the building.
