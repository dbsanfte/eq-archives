I never made any claims to 2 hours, and, as I mentioned, I'd have to look 
at the /played to know how long it really took.  I'd guess 4 or 5 hours 
without actually checking.  That includes detouring to do some quests for 
the newbie armor which included a lot of killing of green mobs.

While 1 to 10 may not be trivial for a new player, it is most definitely 
trivial for someone who knows how to play the game.  By comparison to what 
it used to be like, it is now trivial for a new player as well.  You have 
zero risk when you die, you cannot lose your equipment, you lose zero xp.  
You gain xp very significantly faster than used to be the case.  Short of 
adding the /testbuff command to the production servers, I'm not quite sure 
how they could make levels 1 to 10 more trivial, while still giving a new 
player a little time to get used to the interface.
