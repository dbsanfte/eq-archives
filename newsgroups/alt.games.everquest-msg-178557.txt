OK, I understand, but the real reason anybody would have to upgrade
their PC, not hardware mind you, i'm talking a complete new PC, would
be when the PC you have no longer does what you need it to do.
If your just running Excel or Word , then yes a P3 is fine, hell even
a P1 is fine for that, but if your a gamer you will most likely be
buying a new PC ever year and a half, with hardware upgrades in
between.
The problem is gaming companies are always trying to push the limits
on PC's and misc hardware. Just take a look at Quake 3, it's
ridiculous.
Real time shadows..do I really need this. Real collision particles, So
if I want to shoot up that coke machine in game, I can really shoot it
up..
I mean , it's great that they can do this but shit I'd need a P4 2.4
(or better) gig running 1024 Megs ( or more) with a Video card that
can run everything with at least 128 megs of memory. Crazy.
I have a P3 700 with 512 megs running a Geforce4 64 megs and I
couldn't even walk across one room in the demo.
I guess if you buy a AlienWare or Falcon you'd be set for a while but
you'd still be buying hardware for the next 2 year before your model
becomes 'Game Obsolete".
Now if the Game companies slowed the fuck down on these bells and
whistles your gaming buck would go a lot longer.
I personally do 3D CGI work and for me to upgrade my work rig would
cost the adverage joe an arm and a leg, shit, my Graphics card  is
worth 1 grand alone.But yeah i will have to move up later on, but on a
much slower scale. The other problem is that games are created on rigs
like mine, and get tested on high end PC's with the newest hardware.
And they expect the consumers PC to work just as good, but they never
do. Hell, I can run EQ on my 3D rig with everything turned on and at
the highest resolution with no problem at all, I can run through the
worst  zones packed with people , no sweat. But that's my work rig, my
P3 700  just chokes up .
Unill the game makers slow down you will be buying new PC one after
the other after the other.
