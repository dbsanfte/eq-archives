Load up your level 27 charm song and go to town :-)

Find to mobs similar in level (I like to start with low blues to get a
good rhythm going)

Charm one and the target the other and /pet attack

You now have up to 18 seconds of free melee damage. I like to slow
with Largo's, and dot with the level 30 curtailing chant. If the mobs
are very hard hitting I will slow the taget with Selo's Chain just
before charm breaks, so that I only have to deal with my angry ex-pet.
Stand back and be ready to recharm your pet. (Always keep selo's ready
for a quick escape if you get resists).

Monitor the health of both your pet and the target. when one is close
to death make sure you have the healthier one charmed. Soon you will
have one kill and one almost dead pet to finish off when charm breaks.

I like to have the following songs memmed.

Selo's (speed)
Hymn (Healing)
Chord's (AE DoT)
Charm 
Slow
Chant (Debuff DoT)
Chain (snare)
Vaires -Pixie Strike/Lament (temp mezz), War Song (Self Haste), Psalm
(Damage Shield)

If things start to get ugly just selo and hymn while you
chant-bellow/kite, until you are ready to re-charm.

I love charm kiting.

My favorite fights have been 

1. Baobob Miller vs Chandra Miller (she won)
2. Necro NPC vs his own Pet (Necro Won)
