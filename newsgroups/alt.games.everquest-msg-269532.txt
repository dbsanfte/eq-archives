This goes away at higher levels, though, you can no longer make all
the parts you need yourself but need to e.g. buy spikes from a smith
and washes from an alchemist, to make your maple strongbox.

You can still get all the raw material yourself, and have the
satisfaction of knowing you made actual thing you're using, but you
will no longer be self sufficient.  You won't need to actually work
together with anyone else, though, you just need to get the materials
from them.
