Heh, good question.  I would say, based on my Druid's experience,
that damage shields also do not break root.  My Druid doesn't
melee unrooted mobs anymore, unless he's desperately trying to
root an unsnared mob, and he's always got at least his 'coat' DS
up, and he's always getting hit when he melees, so if DS were
breaking root I'd sure notice it (mobs hit me one heckuva lot
more often than I hit them).
