I would'nt say that Necro is the best for a total
newbie. Sure, is the most easy soloing class with
magicians without any doubt, but there are major
faction and spell subtilities.
I would recommand either a tank (pure bashing as
rogue, warrior or monk) or hybrid (as ranger or
pally or SK) as a starting. If your friend wants
to do a caster and you plan on playing a lot
together .. playing a tank might make sense in
fact (and based on that, a nec isnt that good..
you d like better either a nuker or a healer to
team with)
This way, one can always figure out if he likes
better tanking or casting or both in EQ. Plus,
choosing a good race might be better to learn the
trick of trades in EQ, as the most busy cities in
the game are of good faction. Once you know how to
work faction, anything is possible. The most
difficult classes (to me ) in game are pure
casters : Enchanters, Wizards and Clerics. They
bring a lot to a group, but one has to spend a lot
of time to know how to work well .. and you can
(mostly) forget about soloing quite early in your
carreer...
Well, that's my 2cp anyway ... 8) Welcome in EQ
