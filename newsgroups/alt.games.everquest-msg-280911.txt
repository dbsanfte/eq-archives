Guild Wars avoids this problem quite nicely.  You and your friends can
meet up at any town/city the various characters have all previously
visited, and as all characters are the same race and start in the same
city there's always ONE city you can meet at  :)  Being able to meet
up with friends via a couple of mouse clicks on the World Map is a
very nice innovation.
