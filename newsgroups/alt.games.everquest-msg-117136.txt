Won't work for bags because you can't put a container in a container. 
However, you can have someone kill you in a duel before you log and 
leave them on your corpse. No rent items will last as long as your body 
does that way and, best of all, there is NO chance of someone else 
coming along and grabbing them. I have been known to do that from time 
to time to preserve no rent stuff I needed for quests, when I had to log 
before I could turn it in.
