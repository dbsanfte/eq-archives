You fail to comprehend how badly they don't test.  It wasn't "the one AA"
that I checked that didn't work.  It was most AAs (if not all) that were
combined that didn't work.  As in, they only had to test one, basically any
one, and they should have been able to discern that there was a problem.  I
personally had at least three broken AAs that were visibly and noticeably
broken, and I *didn't* "test".

You fail to comprehend something else.  I'm a fan boy.  I've played EQ since
it started and will probably be the last to log off when the servers go
dark.  I like the game.  That doesn't blind me to the facts.

There are a seemingly endless string of similar stories peppered throughout
the history of the game.  I think the one that convinced me that it was
worse than bad testing, but was in fact no testing, was when they broke bard
songs *entirely* one patch when the patch message specified some small
change to bards.  It was completely obvious that nobody had done even the
slightest bit of testing.  It took about 30 seconds after the servers came
up for the posts to start showing up on the boards complaining about the
fact that bards couldn't play any songs at all.

You can pretend all you want that they test.  I know from a preponderance of
evidence that they do not.
