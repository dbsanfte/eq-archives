I need to read some more systems out there, but does anyone have a bud
system where you offer up your points on an item?

You get say 10pts per raid so the first raid in this system everyone has
10pts warrior sword drops, all warriors want it so they all put up their
10pts, they roll off and warrior #1 gets the sword. Next raid all the other
warriors are at 20pts and warrior #1 is at 10. So if anyone puts up 11
points warrior #1 cant get the item.
Make everything even "it is going to rot who will take it" cost 1 pt.

I am sure there is someone out there with this system, if you got a link
would you mind posting it?

Also to the people who say "everything" has to be worth some point
structure, well that is fine, make everything worth 1pt, and worth some
larger number if something tangible can be show to have happened. Sure it
could be abused, but you can watch for abusers pretty easily and if the
"real" raids point amounts are significantly higher it would make little
difference over the long run as things start leveling out.
