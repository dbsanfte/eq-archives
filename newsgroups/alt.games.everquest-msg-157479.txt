These port for profit people kill me. Here's a little bit to ponder.

I'm sure it has been really great be the rapid transit agency to the 
world, but c'mon, not many other classes have an ability for sale. What 
was the last thing you can remember paying a Beastlord or a Monk for? 
Chances are...nothing. Get over it.

Plus, what areas were taken from you? The cities. Where all the lower 
level, broke players live. You still port to the major upper level zones 
to people that can afford to pay you in the first place. I say again, 
get over it.
