}Although it's tempting to write the "bad" glossary, like so:
}Peeps: Those tasty marshmallow treats shaped like baby chicks, available
}every spring.
}TP to WC: Someone just went to the john without their "important papers" and
}needs someone else to fetch them a roll.
}PST: Pacific Standard Time. Offers may vary in other time zones.
}PLZ: Please, LuZer.... a beg for help and an insult all in one.
}U: Unable to type out you.
}SoW: An adult female pig.
}Crack: What people fall in, exiting High Hold Pass via East Karana.
}Burned Woods: A zone that changes position weekly, depending upon the whim
}of programers, and evil necros who refuse to hand out pigs.
}I'm sure there's a lot more than that. But that's enough for now.
