I remember that working before I had static IPs, but it doesn't seem to 
work anymore. The second address that comes up is 216.160.96.254, which is 
one of Qwest's servers (my ISP). My computers connect to the router (which 
is merely acting as a hub now I think), then it connects to my modem, then 
the modem goes out to the Internet.

The reason I have static IPs is that they came with other stuff I wanted 
as well. I liked having a static IP for when I need to FTP to friends or 
reach my computer from a remote location to grab something, the IP is 
always the same. Also it allowed me to have domain forwarding, so 
www.thalunatik.com for example actually is my ISP given webspace. Now 
people can send email to blahblah@thalunatik.com without knowing it's 
actually my ISP email address they're going to. It's not really necessary 
for me to have that, but I like the personal touch I get by having my own 
domain :)  Also when I establish an ftp I can just use ftp.thalunatik.com, 
no need for IPs.
