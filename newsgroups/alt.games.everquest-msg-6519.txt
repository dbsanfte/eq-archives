Um, what are you talking about? I presume you're worried about the
level of your pet giving away more information than just whether or
not you can be attacked... but will it really be all that helpful? The
pet won't tell anyone if you're higher or lower than the opponent, and
if it DID become a problem, it could easily go the other way if mages
started casting pets a spell level lower to make themselves look lower
than they are if someone cons their pets.

I concur with Davian on this... it's aimed at newbiekillers, not at
the poor lil' twinks.

And I'd really like to see a high elf alone in Neriak, especially at
level five.
