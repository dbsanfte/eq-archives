No, you can get to an instance, -maybe- the original one, maybe not. 
I've literally seen my son log out and back in a half dozen times in a 
row trying to get to the instance where he lost his body (I told him not 
to stay in the tutorial past 10 for just this reason... right before he 
died)

I've been in a group, died, and had to log back in three times before 
rejoining them.

One of the Epic Dawn crowd (back when we were the Icarus Down crowd) and 
I tried to join up as newbies both by relogging and by repeatedly dying, 
never did manage it.

Is this a big deal?  Well no, its only the tutorial, and overall the new 
tutorial is one of the best things I've seen in the game.  But its a 
nuisance, and its a bigger nuisance to genuine newbies (not that there 
are a lot of those) who are of the "I want to log on with my friends and 
figure out how to play this game together" ilk.
