Both hands stay near the keyboard. This is a major advantage to some
styles of play.

eg. my brother plays a bard and has bound his songs (usually ALT-1 to ALT-8)
to his numeric keypad. With Num Lock on, he can steer with his thumb while
twisting with his fingers.

It's also a big plus to touch typists I assume.
