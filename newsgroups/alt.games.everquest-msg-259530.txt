This isn't a troll, I hope. I played tons of EQ then gave it up after a year
long trip away. I still miss it, but I'm slightly concerned about my nephews
who have got into Web based games called Tibia and Runescape.

At this point I have to admit to having a very addictive personality. EQ
occupied my thoughts as I woke up and as I went to sleep. I found it very
comforting. I still have friends in Europe and USA through EQ.

Am I being unfair? Is EQ and it's clones as harmless as, superficially, it
appears to be or will it detract from the bigger picture? I know that there
is no absolute answer to these questions but I want to know what you all
feel.
