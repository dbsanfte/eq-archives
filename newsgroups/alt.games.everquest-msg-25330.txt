I haven't actually tried yet.  I understand that there is also the potential
problem of a Lich that wanders the area.  I also understand that the drop is
rare.  The snowball was easy, I went in with a group of guildmates, and got
it at some point during the fight, wasn't really trying for it.  The hardest
thing for me to get so far was the Cauldron Shell for the one bracer I
needed.  I killed way too many Tidal Lords before I finally got that stupid
shell.
