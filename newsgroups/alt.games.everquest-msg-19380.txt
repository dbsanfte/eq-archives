I am not sure how to explain what i mean.  But I have this person on my
friends list who everytime i come on he asked me to leave my husband to come
move to texas to be with him.   I have never lead him on and I have never
been more than friends with him.  It seems that he can't tell the difference
between a friendly in game hello! and a situation that would lead to
something else
