Worse, by the time you actually use this spell a lot (49 for
pet canni) you have an insta cast reclaim item in your Sol-Ro
foci.

Useful for you to hunt wisps with from level 8-11, as your pet
can't innately hit magic until it's level 10+ and the level 8
summon gets you a level 9 (IIRC) pet.

I found that, with few exceptions, water was my best <29 solo
pet and fire was my best 29-49 solo pet.  Once you get your
sol-ro focus items Water has the same hp as earth, no annoying
root and more DPS.  Focused fire has about 80% of that HP,
but the innate DS is a HUGE bonus.

Don't rely on looting a weapon for the pet - go to East Freeport,
at Hallerd's Resales you can buy rusty 2 handed swords for a 
couple of GP each.
