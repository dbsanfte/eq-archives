I love the GEBs quest, it was really a lot of fun (except for camping
Foulgill).  I think every healer and finger-wagler needs a pair of the
boots.  Shoot, even I, as an assassin, take off my JBoots for long
fights to keep the power flowing (+20 in-combat is nice).  I started
another group on the quest this weekend, and we killed the Big Squiggly
for them.  Sadly, lacking a group inviser and being awfully close to
raid time, we had to postpone it until later this week.

Another thing to be aware of with Magelomus is that he despawns if you
take to long killing him.  You have something like 15mins after the
start to drop him or he will despawn on you.  Once you learn to bring
him to the door, the only problem is the time limit, which really isn't
a problem if you have two full groups.  I did manage to get knocked
into the lava once... one of my friends from another guild was watching
us fight and just about died laughing... From the door, I got booted
all the way across the entry to land in the lava on the far side.  I
guess the sight of a rat flying through the air was awesome, need to do
that again and get somebody to screenshot it for me.

I had no idea you could stand still and not die.  The way we do it
seems a lot easier, since there is no time limit.  Every platform in
the room submerges, except the elevator control (where we stick people
who haven't done it before), and the platform with the bottle you are
rubbing.  The trick to that is that you have approximately two seconds
after killing him to jump back to the center because the platform you
are fighting on submerges.

You'll get him.  This has become one of our stops daily to kill because
it is fun (and drops some decent stuff occasionally).

Good luck on your next attempt, and enjoy your boots!
