I've been refused admittance to the party because they had a tank already:
one warrior, one cleric, one wiz working the bandits; I may not be
considered main tank but I can put a hurting on them and I always protect my
casters.   It was funny to see the group running for the zone because they
can't handle an add or 2 five minutes after telling me to shove off.  Always
better to have more in the group, more damage done in less time.
