I lost my body, not a new thing, but I lost it good and gone this
time. All the wonderful twinks you gave me, gone. I'm sick about it. I
had the claws and shield in the bank, but every thing else gone. I was
saving cloth armor for newbie gifts, so I have some to wear now.

Story: Well it was a dark and stormy night. All things evil where
afoot. Bah!! It was stupidity, plain and simple. I was practicing my 2
hand slash on tiny unsuspecting critters and chased something for a
distance. Probably chased something else as well, don't remember, but
anyway... Orc Oracle jumped me, first I'd seen, knew it was a bad
thing. This things hp meter never friggin moved even when I could hit
it with my poor 2 hand slash, turned and ran, but where. Brought up my
track and no merchants/guards showed, deep shit. But I still kinda
thought I knew the direction and didn't think I was that far from
Kelethin. First major blunder, didn't bring up the loc command when I
was going down. Second thought, I play at odd hours which means not
many people on, even in a popular spot like Kelethin. Used shout
several times but no one could help. Need to rethink this problem.
Third blunder, check track more often when not set for major mobs.
This will keep me closer to safety. In other words don't practice far
from home. Forth blunder, hot keys are not set up for the charactor.
This will be fixed today, come hell or high water. Fifth blunder, I'm
sure it's there, just need to play more to find it and I know I will.

Bottom line. I feel horrible about this as I was going to play
according to your wishes/conditions and either pass the stuff to
newbies or return them to you when I no longer needed them. I will
make it up by replacing , as best I can. I feel like such a pain in
the ass.
