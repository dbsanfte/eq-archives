I think Bard is easily the fastest bet, I'm with Ben on this. The most uber
Bard that I ever knew was Mastermune, one of our Reso bards and easily the
captain of the team that led Reso into Kod'Taz. She wasn't even that big a
twister, she was just damned good at swarm kiting and pulling unbelievable
pulls out of her ass. One of her proteges, Narcisse, used to solo the first
GoD sewer trial (which is ridiculous and I would never have believed it had
I not witnessed it myself once on a BS verification test). Your guy is
probably at the point where he can start swarm kiting in Valor. I don't know
if this is still a preferred spot but I saw many in Valor all the time on FV
and they leveled faster than anyone I knew. And then there was a the Bard
Tactics exploit, which has since been fixed (I think).

Did you know that there is an all-bard guild (I forget their name now, Molto
Expressivo)? I used to wonder how they raided ...
