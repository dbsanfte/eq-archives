Sure, but these are the real changes being proposed, we're in a 
different area here, where someone suggested a much more dramatic change 
where warriors became, not just a little better at taunt and damage 
mitigation/absorbtion, but far and away the best.

This is ideally what will happen, warriors will be a bit better at one 
thing, paladins at another, SK at another, but all would be acceptable 
substitutes for each other unless you have something specific in mind. 
Currently most people do not see warriors as anything but a distant 
third, while paladins and SK enjoy the "either will do" thing we are 
talking about here.

But I think anyone who's been playing the game for a substantial lenght 
of time will recall a time when Warriors were the unquestioned top of 
the heap, and groups would only take Knights (still considered 
interchangeable) out of sheer desperation.  The current situation is 
nearly as bad for warriors, but at least thats only one class instead of 
two.

Splendid
