you know, after reading about how well things run over there on FV + how
well things go when good AGE people are grouped up, it really is quite
tempting to start up a FV char

i don't really know anyone on FV personally, but based on how things sound,
i bet i'd have a ball over there, and while we're on the topic of insane
pieces of greymatter and what thoughts they conjure........

if anyone .....certainly one who was crazy....proposed some kind of AGE
guild/steady grouping  on FV, hell, i'd join =P
