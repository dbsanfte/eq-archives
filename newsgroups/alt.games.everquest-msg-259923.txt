What is the detective series where the guy has a ghost partner? I 
saw one episode sort of accidently [it was called something about 
bog bodies, and when I first tuned in they were in a museum, 
talking to a couple curators and about 5 minutes in I figured out 
it was a program not a documentary, but it beat the heck out of 
the crap on american tv so i watched it...but they havent shown 
any more episodes=(
