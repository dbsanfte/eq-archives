There are some items with Flowing Thought I (nothing with II to X so far
although they seem to be in the code). I think the 7th Coldain Shawl quest
gives on of these items and I think I saw a screenshot of a drop of Innoruk
(the god) which had it as well.

Maybe some of the higher levels can help you here.
