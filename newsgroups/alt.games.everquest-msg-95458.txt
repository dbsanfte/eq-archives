The purpose of AFK is to serve as notice that you're temporarily away
from the machine. Note use of key word "temporarily". Any reasonable
person would agree that it covers quick breaks, changing diapers,
grabbing a beer, and that sort of thing. Far fewer people would agree
that it means "go to bed for the night".

Nothing wrong with that. If you're not actively working the camp, you
have no claim on it whatsoever.

>So now I just go afk with pet on spawn point... 

And in that case you're also not actively working the camp. An NPC
that you happened to have cast is working it. IMO, it's no longer your
camp should someone who is actually (perish the thought) *playing* the
game wants it.

Besides which, of course, the concept of "owning" a camp is entirely a
player invention, and not one supported by Verant.

>takes too much time and mana to resummon and buff pet

If you'll pardon the sarcasm... "poor baby".
