I think as long as you are not hunting  and the buff does not cost you
anything then go ahead.  I always buff people when I am just running around
turning stuff in or buying stuff.  It is a friendly thing to do and it will
help you raise your casting skills too.  As a Shaman, if I only waited to
buff and heal people or myself when I was grouped or soloing I seriously
doubt my skills would be where they are now.
