The game of the year should be game that breaks new grounds, not based on
your own preferences. And that game should go to Grand Theft Auto 3. If I
where to give the game of the year based on my preferences I would pick
Final Fantasy X (and fuck you final fantasy haters, go play Quest 64 of
something).

Ico is great but its just an adventure game and doesn't break anything new.
Halo an improved Tribes game. Max Payne "bullet time", seen it done with
other games before it was released. Star Wars Rogue Leader, how many times
have you played this game, it's the same with improved graphics.
