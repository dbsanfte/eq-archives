You can "buy" a secure credit card. Basicly what this is a credit card on
which you put a $300 (or other ammount) deposit. When the bill comes you
still need to pay the bill as if it were a regular credit card, only if you
do NOT pay the $300 deposit will be used and you lose your card.

I simple terms this means you can start building your credit again, and
still have a credit card with limited spending. Works great for small
purchases - like everquest :)
