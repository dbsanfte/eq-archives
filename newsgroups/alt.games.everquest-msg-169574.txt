I was hoping no one would mention BLs :-P

To be completely honest I think BLs are a bit overpowered. They are
godly soloers. Sustainable DPS with pet and self melee (BIG advantage
over pure INT/WIS casters). A constant stream of dark blues means a
constant stream of exp for a BL. Minor healing ablilty and utility
spells to reduce downtime. Their biggest weakness is crowd control,
which makes them mostly an outdoor soloing class. (much like a Druid).

Initially not wanted/needed in groups, the addition of the "Spiritual"
line of mana regen spells (stackable with all other mana spells) makes
them very much wanted in groups from level 44 on up.
