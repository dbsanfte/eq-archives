I do believe that Runnyeye is the current hotspot for your level, 20 to 25.
As a duo, you could very likely do well in the 25-30 hot spot, Hollowshade
Moor, particularly since Hollowshade is outdoors.

I would lean more towards Hollowshade as a duo.  Runnyeye, while a fun zone,
can be very difficult, indoors, lots of closed doors, easy to get lost, easy
to disappear under a sea of green skinned gobbies.  Something that looks a
little like these (We got very lucky):
