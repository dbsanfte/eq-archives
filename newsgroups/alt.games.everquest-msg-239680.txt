Then I would put all in STA... that is what I did... I have just made
various characters over time, couldn't remember if there were any left
over after you maxed STA.

How man HP for each point of STA... not sure on exact formula, but if
you browse the Monkly Buisness forums, you will see that the Majority
of the community agrees STA is the way to go.  The issue in the long
run is... there appear to be a limited # of items with a STA bonus on
them, that is why Most monks put their points in STA, so it will be
less of an issue down the road.
