The EULA doesn't say that.  It says (and I quote): "You may not use any
third party software to modify the Software to change Game Play".  MapX
clearly doesn't modify the Software; it only watches a log file.

Software like ShowEQ also doesn't modify the software but may or may
not fall foul of section 7 of the EULA, pertaining to reverse
engineering.  Even that's debatable.  MapX doesn't do any reverse
engineering so does not contravene section 7; the log file is
human-readable text.

Now, if you want to argue that it's still cheating, consider also:

- EQ Companion (http://home.inreach.com/kai/EQCompanion)

  This parses your logs and displays all sorts of useful information
  about your character as you play the game (damage per second, hit
  rate, proc rate, much much more).  Tells you nothing you couldn't
  figure out yourself, just much easier.  By your criteria, cheating.

- EQ Raider

  This parses your logs and gives you a list of all the characters
  seen, allows you to quickly form groups for big raids.  Nice time
  saver, but by your criteria, cheating.

- Copeland's Weapon Analyzer

  Shows very clearly which weapon combo is optimal for your class &
  level.  IMHO, a considerably larger advantage than knowing where you
  are on a map.  So by your criteria, cheating.

Do you argue that all of these should be banned?  Verant don't seem to
mind, and frankly, it's their opinion that matters if anyone's does,
certainly not yours.
