Dearic goes into a bezerker frenzy!

Sooner if you're fighting a red or yellow.

If you don't have a warrior as the tank, you'll have to just judge where 30
percent of life is. ; )

This can work fine.

Yes.   Complete heal can be the most mana efficient spell in the game.   But
don't even think of casting it on a robed one.   Using both of your hit point
buffs, including symbol, makes it incredibly mana efficient.   And it gets
more so, the higher level the tank is.  At level 60, my warrior will have over
4200 hit points when buffed.  5000 if a shaman is around.  And not being in an
uberguild, my hit points are on the low side, although thats getting better.

Even casting a bit early, a CH'ing cleric will generally get around 3000 -
3500 hp of healing on a cast.  For 400 mana.   By comparison, the 53 cleric
spell Divine light heals 900 hp for 350 mana.


> Did I say that long cast time scares me?

Scares me too sometimes, if the cleric isn't paying as close attention as I
would like. : P

I would recommend you use it though, to get a feel for where you have to cast
it, and get the timing down.   To get to the point where it doesn't scare you,
since it *is* what you will be using at the highest levels.
