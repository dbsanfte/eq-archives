My point:

Verant and Sony marketing SoL with horse enhancements etc... but those SoL
enhancements only the GMs (and a few extremly lucky individuals) will ever
get to see..! (Call it a design flaw if u will).

I haven't seen 1 single horse yet (and yes i have turned on the GFX). Most
people say they would rather that Verant implemented Ferrari's instead of
horses for that price. Yes i know Verant say "its a status symbol", but i
think Verant are missing the point totally. Is SoL a failed upgrade to EQ?
It's like saying that there is free platinum pieces on Jupiter... but
ofcourse you can't travel there...... (a game enhancement nobody can or will
get).

Some say they don't think horses are implemented in SoL, i think its just a
scam by Verant to get people to buy SoL. Some have also said "i don't think
the SoL graphics engine can tackle horses anyway..."
ROFLMAO @ Verant
