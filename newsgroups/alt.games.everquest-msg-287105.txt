I recall as a level 4 Warrior Dwarf, being asked by an adventuresome
fellow (HI Elf Wizard) to go with him to Kelethin, and Orc Hill.  I
had NEVER ventured out of Butcherblock before (it took a week to get
to level 4 for me, remeber that!), and I thought the forest of GFay
was dark and forboding.  Especially when I had a couple Orc's jump us
on the way.  I ran all the way to the tree city, and I recall it
vividly, thinking, great...now I can't get back!

Heck, that nasty ogre pair near the GFay zone in BB were terrifying!

My first efforts in Kithicor were amazing.  The place was wild, going
undead (just like the movies) at night.  I never tried a halfling
because I knew I'd have to go thrugh Kith to get anywhere!

Today I go through without a concern...

Yep, fear makes a game great.
