No sorry. That still make no sense at all. You are not taking anything
away from the soloer so nothing is lost. All that has changed is that the
soloer is now envious that grouper gets more experience. Are we all
in some sort of a race to level?

You also have to spend time getting in a group or getting a group
together to play.

The key there is 'well run' group. Some groups are indeed as you have
said, others get you killed. That is the trade off.

Like the group it all depends on what you hunt. Guard killing/kiting
has little to no risk.
