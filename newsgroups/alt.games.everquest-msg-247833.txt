I'd go to Innothule, track spiderlings to that fallen froglok, see
nothing, /target a_crab_spiderling, snare, and up it'd squirm from the
fallen froglok's corpse along with a bleeder larva or two. I'd pull a
lot of spiderlings out of that particular hole. In Xorbb, I'd sit high
up on a zone wall, visible, and wait till a dozen walled muddites
decided to come hit me.
