I hope someone can help me with this....

I'm in Freeport, and I found the guild easily, but I only found two vendors
with Necro spells there, and neither has Cavorting Bones. 

1. Where do I find that spell for sale? Or do I have to complete a quest to get
it? (I checked AT LEAST seven different websites, and none of them has that
information)

2. Which first level Necro spells are the least useful in the long run?

3. If a pet is destroyed, how long before you can summon it again? Can you
summon it again immediately, or do you have to wait?
