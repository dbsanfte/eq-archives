A week or two ago I was driving around in downtown Denver, lots of one way
streets, a number of streets that kind of wander around.  Got somewhat
turned around, wasn't sure what direction I was headed, couldn't see the
mountains due to the buildings.  So my first thought was:  a couple of /locs
and I'll know which way I'm going.  Maybe it's time for a little break.
