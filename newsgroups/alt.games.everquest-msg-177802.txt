First off, what wattage power supply are you using? If you are
using an Athlon + an Nvidia you better have something 350+++.
Both of those are very demanding for power. VERY.

Heatsink goo? Nah, that's minimal performance increase believe me.
Sure, fans are good, but in order for things like you explain to happen
you'd have to have like NO FANS.

Secondly, I would go over your bios settings. Goto your Nvidia brands
website (www.pny.com) if its pny. And check the FAQs on what they
recommend for video bios settings.

Lastly, update the motherboard/bios drivers.This is flash updating so please
read the instructions carefully.

Let me know how it works!
