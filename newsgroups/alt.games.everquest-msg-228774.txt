Mage pet canni is significantly more annoying than shaman canni, at 
least at the levels I've achieved in both classes.

Shaman canni: whenever not FM and not otherwise occupied, canni, 
whenever HP low, stoicism.  Use best judgement, don't get insanely low 
on HP unless you know there are no mobs that might decide to Low HP 
aggro you.  Risk?  Yes indeed, low HP can turn surprises into deaths. 
But hard?  No, not really.  And you can do it almost constantly.

Mage canni: kill pet, make new pet, kill pet, make new pet, repeat until 
FM, then make real pet, buff pet, gear pet, get party members to buff 
pet, finally ready to go.  Run LOM?  Repeat; and the First pet you kill 
doesn't really get you anywhere near what you spent on him back, since 
those buffs (except perhaps HP buffs by others) don't get you any extra 
mana back.  Further, during the time you are doing canni, you have no 
pet at all ready to go except for brief instants just after a cast 
finishes and before you slap the reclaim item (insta click).

With Canni V shaman have to work a little harder, running both that with 
its long recast time and Canni IV with its normal cycle; this also eats 
another spell slot.  But then  a serious canni mage is running one pet 
for reclaims ( at the moment, 50 MS pet for me) and a second as the 
"real" pet (53 air or 57 earth at the moment, either a lot more HP and 
damage output than that 50 MS pet... but more expensive relative to the 
mana I get back for killing them).

After 60 its possible for a mage to get Suspend, which would allow me to 
put a real pet in storage and canni more seriously, and then a better 
version of suspend which would allow me to put a pet with full gear and 
buffs on (I -think-) and then I'd be able to canni with little in the 
way of negatives in terms of having to rebuild pet after each canni 
cycle.  -Still- will be without pet while actually doing canni, though.

It does seem to me that mages -are- balanced with pet canni in mind, 
we've been given tools to make it work better, told (when complaining 
about poor mana regen options) to "look to the pets", and aren't 
normally listed as top DPS class in any of the lists I've seen. 
Competitive, yes, but not at the top, as you might think if having twice 
the mana regen potential of any other class was all it took to get 
there.  Mana regen is important, but considering our relatively low DPS 
off nukes, and our aggro limitations, we -need- to have our pets out 
there, fully buffed up and working constantly, to compete.  Pet canni 
kills pet DPS and our own DPS (busy doing pet canni, pets don't do any 
DPS and neither do we).

Mages already recieved a Massive mana regen nerf, the mod rod thing. 
Taking an item that could be used as fast as you could click it and 
turning it into one where you have to wait 5 minutes between clicks 
dropped mage (and cleric and anyone else standing near  a mage) mana 
regen into the toilet.  It took substantial retooling for SOE to make 
mobs balance remain sort of consistant with the massive lowering of 
available mana.

This change, though, affects only mage mana regen, so there's not likely 
to be any retooling at all.  Seems to me, instead, mages are just going 
to drop in potential output to satisfy a philosophical point; mages 
weren't being pointed out as unbalanced before, so what is nerfing them 
going to achieve?  The opposite of what most game changes seem to be 
aimed at; Imbalance.

Not that the same thing wasn't done to Monks already, nor (in an odd 
way) to warriors... but now SOE is trying (perhaps poorly) to redress 
those ancient wrongs and raise those classes back up to a rough parity 
with their competition.

Apparantly, though, they haven't learned anything from this lesson.
