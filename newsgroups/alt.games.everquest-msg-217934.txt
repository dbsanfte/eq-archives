Like that pathetic mother whose son suicided so decided it had everything to
do with EQ and of course nothing to do with herself. Let me see, now how
much of an influence is 18 odd years of bringing up a kid from an age where
they don't even know if it is wrong or right to smear shit over their faces
and play with their pecker all day? Now for the kicker - how much are
genetics involved in the chances of developing mental illness? So - Little
Johnny  smokes a 10 gauge and of course it is <nothing> to do with the
parents... Of course not.

Last I heard she was still milking the media bandwagon and has turned into a
fulltime proffessional victim. Who decides who makes worthy spokepersons
anyway? I would have thought bringing up stable, balanced offspring who
don't smoke 10 gauges would be a prerequisite for those telling everyone
else how to bring up their kids...
