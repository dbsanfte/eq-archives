Well Guardians of the Truth on MT seem to have a lot of euro players -
see the website at www.holycrapitslate.com/gtruth - there's a timezone
given for everyone in the members listing, most are GMT+2 (must be
central Europe, I'm in the UK and we're on BST, GMT+1 at the moment...)

For more info on Guardians of the Truth, look out for me on Morell Thule
as Elidar, Memnos or Frazzles.


There was a UK guild started on MT, United Kingdoms I believe, but I
never joined it since there were never many members on when I checked -
may have never got off the ground...

You loathe having fun, helping each other out on quests, and exploring
the wonderful world of Norrath? Maybe I've misread it, but if you loathe
all that and aren't a d00d, what on earth *do* you want from a guild?
