Well, it's true that I think my brother's EQ playing was getting out
of hand! But he was the one who called me last night to tell me he was
going cold turkey. He didn't think he could go through with posting
his usernames/passwords on the net, and so asked me to do it for him. 

But now I hear that he can recover his accounts from Sony? Hm, if so
then this isn't as irrevocable as he'd led me to believe... and he may
be back off the wagon soon!

Perplexed,

Mary
