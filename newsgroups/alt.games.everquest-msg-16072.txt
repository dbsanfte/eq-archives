I was AFK at the time and came back to see this Erudite Pally attacking me,
first thought "Oh Shit an NPC" then I recognise the name, then my ISP
enforces it's 2 hr kick and I go LD, I log in to see him dead, not sure if
he was killed by Goblins or the Server took over as I went LD and I killed
him (this has happened with a Bard NPC that aggro'd me once in Sth Q. Logged
back to find I'm at the back of Fish ales, low on health and with someone
asking if anyone had seen this bard, found out from an eye witness that I
stood there LD and let him beat on me a while then went at him and took him
apart, seems I'm much meaner as an NPC than I am as PC) anyway I was leaving
Runnyeye at that point so dragged his corpse to the misty zone.
