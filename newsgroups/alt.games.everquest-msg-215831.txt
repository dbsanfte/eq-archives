    Let me tell you a brief story.

    Once upon a time, my shammy partner and I, in our mid 50's, were duoing
eyes and frenzy in velk's. It was one of those beautiful camps for us, had
us pretty much on edge, and used every weapon in the sk/shammy arsenal to
cope with the mobs, and carried the chance of some very nice loot.

    Along came another SK, and asked to join our group. Now normally when
duoing, if we've got a camp nailed, it's about a 50-50 whether we'll let
someone else in. If they're from either of our guilds, no question. If
they're a friend, no question. But a stranger wanting the 3rd wheel position
is usually, I'm sorry to say, a liability. But on this occasion, we were
doing quite well and I was in bouyant mood from the whole situation, and was
about to suggest we invite him when my shammy partner said:

    "This asshole trained me and another guy the other night in seb"

    Zang. No effing way was this guy grouping with us. So straight off,
there's a "no-group" list in action.

    "sorry," I said, "but you have an appalling reputation, we can't group
with you."

    the guy laughed and said something like "but I'm so ubah!"

    And proceeded to train us. Naturally, with Evil on his side, his feign
worked and mine didn't. I died while distracting the train as my shammy
friend escaped ;)

    He proceeded to continually train us and the few other people in velk's
for around an hour after that. I know for fact he was petitioned by multiple
parties, but nobody could get a tell from him admitting to training, so to
cut a long story short absolutely nothing was ever done by SOE staff.

    So the matter ended there, you might think. Not quite. That guy went on
my friends list. Over the coming weeks I discovered by chance he had an alt
of almost the same level, and he joined my friends list too. Every time
either character joined a guild, the corresponding guild leader got a tell
from me, and from several other people I had found who were victims of this
idiot, explaining his past, his reputation, his actions. He never lasted
more than 3 days in any given guild - even the guilds with bad reputations
seemed unwilling to tolerate him. As time went by it got easier. If you can
give a guild leader the name of 3 guilds who have booted someone in the last
few weeks, they tend to see the light quicker. I'll never know if the tells
or the guys own stupid behavior got him booted from each guild, or if it
were a combination, but I don't care.

    I haven't seen either character on in a long while, but they're never
leaving my friends list, and they're never going to be free of their past.
Shitlists work just fine, depending on how vindictive and persistent their
keeper is.

Kind Regards,
James
