Capitalism is great at producing gigantic SUVs and tiny cellphones, and 
I'm not complaining, because I like my toys as much as the next guy (
actually, considering the money I spend on gadgets, probably a lot more), 
but it doesn't do anywhere near as good a job when you are talking 
public health, justice or education. To believe that one single system 
is the perfect solution for every situation *is* a religious position.

> What makes you think that I have not visited europe?

I'm sure I'd remember the "Man finds Socialist in bowl of soup" 
headlines... :)

> Maybe more europeans should visit us :) 

Absolutely. I lived there for five years, myself, and I loved every 
minute of it. Hell, I do so much promotion for the US tourist industry 
here, I should be getting paid.
