I have a 9 wizard and a 19 shaman. I have made some cash with the lvl 19
shammy, and used it to startup the wizard...

I bought the wizard a Dragoon Dirk, a Skull of Je'ntra, a Frozen Mantle, a
Black Iron Medailon, a Savant Cap, a int2 ring, a 5hp 5 mana ring, and two
simple onyx earrings with dex2. I also gave my Wizard a Runed Totem Staff
for 2HB.. my shammy looted that of a splitpaw gnoll in blackburrow.

The earrings and the rings were the only items bought with own-earned money,
and i have 7pp on the bank now. I do not plan to get the wizzie any more
money, i gave him some cash at lvl 1, and thats all he gets.

Is this what is considered twinking? I'm just wondering if i have a pretty
good lvl 9 Wizard now....i think its quite nice, he has a 141 INT level
now.....
