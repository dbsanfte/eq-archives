Very few such scenarios really.  Admittedly, I mostly work in the real 
time embedded environment, where it really is not possible to debug 
without affecting the system in some way.  You can limit the effects, 
but, you cannot eliminate them entirely.

In a nonrealtime environment, you can use a debugger that should have no 
discernable effect on the results.

Basically, anytime you connect a device to a system you are debugging in 
order to debug it, you are altering it, at least subtley.  The hope is 
that what is being altered is not significant.
