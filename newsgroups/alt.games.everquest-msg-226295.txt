Actually I think it's pretty comparable.  His point is that they're bundling
the demo with an unrelated and inferior product.

And the two products are not related, other than sharing a name.  One is a
MMORPG, the other is a RTS Warcraft clone.

If they had bundled it with LDoN or the "next" EQ expasion, then it would be
less of a problem.  Not that it's worth getting upset about now, but I do
feel it's more than a bit on the sleezy side.  Whats worse is the constant
spam advertisements to buy thier RTS that you have to click through every
time you log into EQ.
