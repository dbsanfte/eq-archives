Not in this case. As I understand it, there is a special case
for the monk epics that allows their haste to stack with spells - as
a result they no longer stack with ATK buffs...

Lawrence Poe at VI has talked continually of "slots" in the spell
stacking code that seem to take an arbitary value and then be of
an arbitary type...

so on one spell slot "1" might be set to "+45" of type "AC"
on another it might be set to "+3" of type "Haste"

However the spells would not stack because they are in "slot 1"
rather of what particular type they are.

Its either that, or they nominate some modifier as the "primary"
modification and work out stacking based on that. In this hyopthesis
I guess they changed the primary modifier from haste to ATK.

Sui, speculating wildly. Again.
