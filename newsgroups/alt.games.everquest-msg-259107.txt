No, James is right here. Organizing such a raid is going to be painful.
You wouldn't believe how depedant people are on their raid leader
concerning tactics. People are lazy. You can count on that when leading
a raid. So everytime you face the mob you have to explain what to expect
and how to deal with it. You can make it shorter the next time but if
you omit it you will have somebody who doesn't have a clue. And if this
can wipe the raid Murphy's law will see to it. ;)
