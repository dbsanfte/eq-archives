Well if their system isn't allowing you to log in, then it obviously IS 
'detecting cookie problems'.

Problem YOU had is that YOU weren't able to work out what had gone wrong.  
And yes, you might argue that you should've been given a nice, simple, 
easy-to-follow explanation, and you might be right.  But far as I can see 
you've burned any credibility you would've had by mouthing off and calling 
people childish names, and by refusing to accept that you had ANY 
responsibility at all for the configuration of your own machine.

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
