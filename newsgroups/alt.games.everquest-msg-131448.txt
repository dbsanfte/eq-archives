Just dinged 34 a couple days ago with my druid, and naturally Ive been
exploring the new places that I can port to. One of the new self ports I got
was Great Divide. My first cursory look seemed to indicate that this would
be a great playground for my druid feasting on the Tizmaks, and making cash
by finding the occasional Velium weapon. My first question is about the
Tizmaks. Is ther any reason that a Wood elf Druid of Tunare should be
concerned about wrecking my Tizmak faction ?

Second question, not strictly about Great Divide but somewhat related. I
have been told that in Thurgardim (sp?) one can purchase, from a vendor, a
Thurgardim Vellium Weapon that is in all respect the same as a looted velium
weapon, EXCEPT that the damage is one higher ( 7 vs 6 ) and that it will
proc Vellium shards starting at level 1.  Is there any truth to this, and if
so, what can I expect to pay for said weapon ?

Any information anyone can provide is appreciated!!
