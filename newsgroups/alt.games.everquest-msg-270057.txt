Maybe elite instanced quests, but certainly not -all- elite quests.
There are several elite quests I soloed in the Loch Modan region,
including Ol' Sooty (Who I came back a few levels later and tamed with
my hunter just for the sake of my ego. ;) ). Most non-instanced elite
quests are a lot easier with a group, yes, but they don't -require- a
group. I could have even soloed the quest for the named elite ogre if
I had been willing to wait a few more levels.
