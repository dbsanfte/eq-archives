Well, SNAFU... but I haven't seen this particular
complaint pop up yet.

I got the patch loaded, I can get thru the login
procedure up to picking a server to play on.
When I select a server, though, screen goes
blank as usual, then up pops a windows style
message box:

eqgame.exe

eqgame.exe has encountered a problem and
needs to close, we are sorry for the inconvenience

and some buttons to allow me to report the problem
to Microsoft if I wish.  Mouse arrow isn't operational
for that box but I can navigate it to some extent... only
I can't get to the blue line that would let me actually
read the report.

I went in and deleted eqgame.exe, patched it again,
and still exact same results.

Any ideas would be appreciated

Bergh
