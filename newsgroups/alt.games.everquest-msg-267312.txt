You'll want a minimum of one enchanter in each corner, bards work too, if 
you can kill MB fast enough for them to keep the spiders mezzed.

MB needs to be burned to the ground as fast as possible, his AoEs are a 
pain in the butt, so, the faster he dies, the less you have to worry 
about them.  Usual tactic is once targettable, bum rush him, with healers 
staying out of range of the AoEs as much as possible, and keeping the MA 
alive.  Good idea to have as much AoE healage as possible, and paladins 
in the groups for group heals, as you will keep your DPS up longer that 
way.

To get the charm upgrade, and, I believe, the AA, you actually need to 
talk to a dwarf in PoK in the other building near the PoT stone.  Hail 
him, and "tell him stories" or something like that.
