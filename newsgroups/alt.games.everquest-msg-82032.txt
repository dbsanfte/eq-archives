not.

Now for more Lord of the Rings DVD news. The Urban Cinephile website
recently posted an online interview with Barrie M. Osborne, who is a
producer on the DVD project. Here's an excerpt from the article which
pertains to the eventual DVD release of "Fellowship of the Ring":

"As for the DVD, Osborne promises it will be released just before the second
film is released theatrically, and it will have on it a longer cut. And at
some point, he admits, the 9-hour version of the trilogy ^- all three films,
end to end -- is also a distinct possibility."

We're also hearing that in addition to the longer cut, you can expect
numerous deleted scenes, audio commentary and extensive behind-the-scenes
material (all of which is arguably a given). The DVD will at least be a 2
disc (and probably a 3-disc) release. And, as you've probably already heard
(in recent comments by New Line's president for worldwide distribution and
marketing, Rolf Mittweg, on TheOneRing.net), the disc is expected to be
released in August, and include an exclusive preview for the next
installment, "The Two Towers".

Amazing news from CNN via David: "A friend of mine was watching CNN today.
They reported that the DVD version of Fellowship was going to be 4.5 hours
long."

Is THAT long enough for you all? And when does it come out?

According to this there's a book being released on Amazon in May which is ''
Published to tie-in with the launch of the video and DVD, this is the first
of three books" [read the synopsis, you'll see it.]

So look for the DVD in May, 2002. Thanks to Corsair of Umbar who noticed
that.

Now, this is a rumour from Kevin, who notes a different time for the DVD
release [July] but concludes that Bombadil's scenes were filmed: "I just
figured that I'd let you know that I recently got a chance to look at the
2002 release sheet for the LOTR Games workshop games. Now, Games Workshop
has a 3-5 (not sure) contract with New Line which says that the only models
they may produce in that time are models from the films. This release sheet
showed that in July, around the time of the DvD release models WILL be
released for Tom Bombadil, Goldberry, and the barrow wights. This means that
it is a definite that the old forest sequence, in its entirety, was filmed,
and that we will see Bombadil in the film."

Hope that helps.
