>Seemed like a good way to leave.

Well I just cancelled my COH sub. After I did it I posted something on
the official forums to say goodbye to all the people I grouped with and
what mmog to catch me on now.

Previously I've stated my last night on and arranged for one last go
but you are often just going through the motions that night and its
rather sad seeing a friend log off knowing he won't be back.
