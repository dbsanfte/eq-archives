}Hm, i *didnt* notice signing up for access and getting given a faq to 
}read up front. I also havent noticed any regularly [weekly] faq being 
}psoted to the list. Most other groups I am on post their faq weekly or 
}monthly.

Yea, it would be nice if subscribing to alt.games.everquest would 
immediately direct you to the FAQ.  It -used- to be, that when you joined 
USENET, your newsreader could be counted on to direct you to the newbie 
newsgroups, that covered topics relevant to all of USENET, such as 
topposting vs. not topposting.  But then AOL and Outlook decided to bring 
USENET access to the whole world without supporting this fine tradition.  
And now, that topic isn't agreed-on USENETwide anymore.  So if you wanna 
blame someone for your lack of a faq about topposting, blame AOL and Bill 
Gates.

}*Maybe if you did, and behaved civilly by asking people to read this 
}weekly faq, this group would look more like a comunity instead of an 
}alt.flamehole.convention sometimes.*

Hmm... did I hear someone volunteer to post the FAQ regularly?  By all 
means, go to it!  It seems rather silly to post it regularly, to me, when 
it is quickly and easily retrieved by a simple google search:
