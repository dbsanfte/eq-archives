Not sure what sort of guild you're in or how much backup you can call
on, so some of my suggestions may be of varying usefulness.

General suggestion: if you can get enough people together, do Kael
Arena for some very big cleric armour upgrades quested in Thurgadin.
It's doable by a single group of high 50's, 2 or 3 groups at your level
(but high level tanks are pretty important, and a high level shaman
will make it a lot easier).

Also, some Plane of Hate armour would be a good upgrade: in particular
the helm, legs & BP.

Forest loops are a minor upgrade, not worth sweating too much about.
The earrings of purity & cleansing from Chardok are very nice upgrades,
but you probably want a 55+ group to get these.

>  two velium Jasper rings 7 WIS

Golem tear ring (Chardok), diamond wedding band (Tower of Frozen Shadow).
Otherwise, these are OK.

>  Black alloy medallion 6AC 6 INT  6 WIS

Good.  Qeynos Honor Badge is nice, but you lose 2 WIS (gaining 25 mana
though, along with permanent See Invis & some other stats).

>  Platinum Ruby Veil 7STR 7 WIS

OK.  Most easily obtainable face slot upgrades would have less WIS on them
(e.g. Enshrouded Veil).

>  Silver threaded bandana (compliments of werewolf invasion) 2AC 1STA 2WIS
>  5 Mana

Very low AC.  Easy WIS upgrades: Nightshade Wreath or that 4 WIS piece
from Permafrost (both low AC though).  Otherwise, EM Helm from PoH or
Sebilite Scale Helm from Sebilis.

>  Bracer of the Revenant 9AC 5 WIS (the only piece of Cleric armor worth

Good.

>  Gauntlets of the Black 15AC 4STR 3WIS

Very good.  Other than Thunder Runed from Kael (rare), you won't see
much better short of some seriously uber stuff.

>  Platinum armband 3STR 3WIS

Crap, but good cleric WIS arm pieces are uncommon.  Nathsar Vambraces
in Chardok would be a good upgrade.

>  Polished bone bracer 2AC 3WIS 3INT

Get another Reverant bracer at least.

>  Adamite Epaulets 9AC 7WIS

Good.  Weight of the Gods would be nice, but you'll need a few groups
to do the Plane of Sky.

>  Chestplate of the Constant 20AC 8STA 5SvMagic

Lacking in WIS.  Frog scale tunic is good, but expensive, same with
Sebilite scale coat - both from Sebilis.  Phase spider carapace is very
nice, but rare in Dragon Necropolis (phase spiders at zone drop them,
dangerous mob though).  As a Brell-worshipping dwarf you might be able
to find a skilled smith to make an imbued BP for you - I'm told they're
very good indeed.  Could be costly though.

>  Mammoth Hide Cloak 7AC 4WIS 5SvCold

Pretty good.  Aegis of Life if you can stand a bad bad camp.

>  Fine Steel Girdle 9AC

Belt of Cenobite if you have friends who can track (Frontier Mtns).
Muci Girdle from HS north wing (pretty easy with a good low 50's group,
and great XP too).  Girdle of Flayed Iksar from Chardok (tougher to
get).  Girdle of Diligent from PoF.

>  Gatorscale leggings 7AC 4WIS 15 HP

OK.  Jarsath if you can wear them (not sure if dwarves can).  Gladiator
Leggings from Kael Arena are great.  Ethereal Mist & Thurgadin quested
are also very good.

>  Boots of the Reliant 11AC 6SvDisease

Another tough item for clerics.  Tribal War Boots from Chardok are very
nice.  Donal's have lots of AC but no stats and the effect (Tremor) is
largely useless.

>  Springwood Club 5WIS 5STR 5INT (who cares what the dam/del ratio is- I'm

Paw of Opolla if you can stand the camp :-)  Otherwise that's alright.

>  Testament of Vanear 10WIS 10 Mana

Charred guardian shield (Sol A), crystal chitin shield (Velk's).
Sarnak Battle Shield from Chardok is very nice, but no WIS.

>  Small Wisdom Diety 2WIS

Do the Coldain Shawl quest part 3 and you'll get a 3 WIS range item
with some extra stats.  Otherwise, Medicine Totem (need a tracking
friend in Frontier Mountains) is good.

198 isn't all that bad, really.  It took me until 59 to be reliably
over 200 WIS (though I have 400-500 extra mana with that as well).

For resists, by far the best route is to try to get some diamonds &
blue diamonds and get a friendly enchanter to make you some jewellery.

Good hunting,
