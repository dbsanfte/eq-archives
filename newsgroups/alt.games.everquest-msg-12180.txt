Turned out to be a limited play-time weekend :-(  being out of town for a good
part of it.  My original goal was to make and get out of 35 hell and move on to
new areas. (Been doing OT and FM since 30.) Started weekend only a bub into 33
because of three consecutive stupid deaths on Thursday night. Got disgusted with
my slowing progress and went back to the ledge for what time I *was* able to
play.  In a series of non-stop-pulling groups, I finished thirty three and got
through 24/25 of 34. Yes, I went to bed with only one blue bubble to go to make
35, because I'd rather start the next session with a ding before the first six
baziliion kills I make, only to check my xp bar and see that I've gotten a
quarter of a blue. :-(
  I was going to leave earlier, but I figure, fuck it. Without any extensive
travelling, learning my way around a new zone, getting stuck in empty zones with
no group, etc. I can keep my fat troll ass right here on the ledge for one more
(albeit long) level and make 36, then head out for bigger and better things. The
ledge in OT may be boring as hell, repetitive, and have some of the worst loot
in the game at this level, but it's non-stop xp and I know how to do it.
