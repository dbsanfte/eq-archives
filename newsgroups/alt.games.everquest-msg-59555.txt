The only difference between the examples given and DAoC is that DAoC
is not mature enough to have a stable high level population. That will
take 3-5 more months. Once it does happen the battles will be much
more even and like TFC. Still TFC occurs in a map that is too small
for real ambushes.  Ambushes will occur in this game and it's
something you need to take into consideration.
