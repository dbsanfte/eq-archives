One really reliable method for avoiding trains is not to sit on the tracks.
If you are sitting at the ME zoneline you deserve to be killed 15 times
untill you get it through your thick head to move elsewhere. The only reason
people ever sit there is because they train often from bad pulling which
means you are probably being hypocritical as well.
