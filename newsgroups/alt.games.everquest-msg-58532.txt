While I agree with you about not needing this change, I think there would be
a rather easy way to impliment this.  Just put a timer on each player that
starts at each exp giving kill.  This timer could start with an exp bonus of
10-20 percent for the next exp kill and slowly count down to 0 exp bonus if
a certain amount of time passes before the next exp kill happens.  This
would work solo or grouped and would encourage the fastest killing of mobs
to get more experience.  I could see it causing different strategies like
"killing salvos" where you would med/heal/buff up to absolute max, then
kill! kill! kill! all you can, as fast as you can, down to low health/mana,
and then breaking for med/heal/buff.

Hmmmm, kind of sounds exciting ;-)

Just one idea.
