    Never said you did. I saw you had the right Delta STA formula, and
wanted to expand on it a bit based on a formula I knew pretty well.

    I've heard 55 is another big HP level for them.

    How big is the difference? Can it be accounted for by rounding or
changes in STA? Because that would imply that there's a "low HPs" level as
well, as by level 60 you'll be at exactly 900+3*STA.
