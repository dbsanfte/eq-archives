No intent to even think about starting an OS flame war... more a
history thing than anything... and, while my memory is a bit hazy on
computer developements going back 10-12 years ago, I almost think the
original multi-tasking environment for a home computer might just have
been the Atari ST... I think Tramiel beat Amiga on release by 3-4
weeks... but lets be honest... Unix beat them all... )

Given a preference, I would love to see a Linux port.  Considering the
close tie-in to DX, I doubt it is really even possible, short of a
complete re-write on the graphics engine.  Would not bother me in the
least to buy it, either... I love the open source/GPL concept, but
there are things worth paying for.

Ah well, all apples and oranges anyway... 95's time has come and gone.
I don't blame MS, or VI, for dropping support of it.  Hell, I have
sound cards in a shoe box that have no driver support in 95 or 98, let
alone ME, XP or 2k )  Just too lazy to throw them out, which is what
needs to be done with them.
