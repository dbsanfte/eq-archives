Call me crazy, but I actually like it.  Let me explain:

Verant has staunchly maintained that they charge for the individual software
because of the development time put into making that game.
Conversely, they have said that the monthy fee is for the servers, routers,
networks, and staff to support YOUR individual game time in their game.  I
see an advantage here, and I have put this to Verant.  Please read on and
support my idea in this.  We customers can have a great voice.

I say that we should be able to play any of the games that Verant puts out
as MMORPG's for the same monthly fee.  All we have to do is buy the
software.  That means we can play EQ, it's 2 patches, EQ2, Star Wars
Galixies, etc... as long as we buy the software for them.  Think about it.
They're all billed in the same way by the same company and into the same
billing system.  AND since I am only playing one at a time, then their
statement that my monthly is paying for the hardware and support staff to
allow me to play I am still doing my part for any of their games I am
playing.  Period.

Thoughts?
