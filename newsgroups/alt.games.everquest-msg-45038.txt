I have to speak up and say that I have been fortunate enough to group with
Jakugg often.  What a superb player he and his EQ partner Tiru are.  He is
probably THE best group and raid leader that I have played with on that
server.  He always has a plan and strategy for whatever situation we end up
in.  That being said, He is activly developing a server wide multi-guild
raiding force of like minded players.  I have been in some of his
multi-raids and they have been my best EQ experiences yet.  Highly recommend
them.  If you are on Xev and of the appropriate levels (45-55), send Jakugg
a tell.
