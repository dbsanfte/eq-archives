Hrrrm... Chain stun *might* work, but why bother? I'd keep your first 4 up, 
then Mark of Kings and Mark of the Righteous and DB and DA.

Mark of the righteous is a cleric DS- we cast ours on the mob, not the 
player. This sucks in a way, because one cast only lasts one mob... Then 
again, it's good in a way because one cast is like DSing everyone on the 
raid.

Mark of Karn/Kings is good to have up because it overwrits most of the DSes 
a mob will have... Any cleric will tell you that DSes make them flinch.
