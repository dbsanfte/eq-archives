Yes, flame me.  I have been in and out of this group for ages and you are 
always here demonstrating your never ending negativity to the community. 
That's ok, you are of little consequence.  I could care less about the EULA 
or the rules you will no doubt spout.  I have an account, I will not be 
using said account anymore and I am offering it to someone who is going to 
use it.  It's the insufferable, I am better than you attitude that EQ 
regulars such as yourself that is the reason why I no longer play.

But since you took the time to snip my post, I will say again.  53 bard, 20+ 
Pally, and 12 ranger, all expansions through GOD, will never be used by me 
again.  ghostdog069@yahoo.com if anyone is interested.
