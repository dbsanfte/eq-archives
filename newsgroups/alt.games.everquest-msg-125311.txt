>Game sounds or winamp/CD music? If music, then what?

I never play winamp stuff while playing EQ. Since I play at night, I
never have anything loud, so I have game sounds and either listen to
whatever the TV plays as night music (more convenient than finding a
radio channel) or an Enya/Loreena McKennitt/Tori Amos CD or the LotR
soundtrack, turned really low. (I haven't been in the mood for NIN and
similar while I play for a while, but I do think  I need to get a hold
of some Linkin Park, at the very least. The TV night DJs tend to cover
my needs for that kind of stuff for the time being)
