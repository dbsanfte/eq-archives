I got to show off my appalling soloing skills last night... went to
EW, and the place was crawling with griffons. I was tempted to try to
get a pet but ended up just root dotting the griffons and got my last
two eggs *shows off her shiny new range slot item*

On a couple occasions, I had 4 regular and one elder griffon on track,
or 3 griffins within visible range - this led to the discovery of how
social the griffins are, as at one point I got two others going after
me. And since I was too much of a wuss to try to charm something, I
spent a LOT of mana dotting and had a lot of downtime, especially when
I had to evac twice - once because of the two extra birds after me and
once because the only thing stupider than rooting yourself while
pulling a griffon is to proceed to root the griffon on top of you
instead of just fearing it away...

I did kinda want to try the charm tactics and I regret not trying at
least once last night, I guess I might use them when I have to get my
blood wolf harness, or go after some other of the blue animals in EW
one night I can't get a group.
