It was in response to his ironic claim of who was disrupting the group.
It was not intended to be an accurate portrayal of the current situation
or group history.

Behind every troll flame there is a combination of motives. "People
perpetuate the BS flame war because they LIKE it" is only one of them.
Another motive can be to preserve the integrity of the group, indeed, a
sense of outrage at a troll's existence. Another motive is that of the
social climber, flaming trolls to increase the flamer's social standing
as they perceive it. 

Prescribing the "Just ignore them" stance is an attack in itself, and
you seem keen to separate that attack from it's less worthy motive; the
writer's amusement. That is of course, your way of adding gravity to
your favoured "Ignore the troll" method in the same way that the vocal
flamer ups the invective in their attacks. The end message remains the
same:

Troll, Go Away.

It's the same old story; troll meets newsgroup, troll trolls newsgroup,
newsgroup has fun bashing troll, newsgroup gets bored of troll, troll is
ignored, troll goes away.
