I'll grant that its speculation. However, given that there is little to 
no enthusiasm here about LoE, but a fairly decent amount of interest in 
the EQ2 beta I don't think its unreasonable.

It is clearly targeted at EQ1 players. After all, Warcraft players who 
in theory might be interested in LoE don't benefit from the EQ2 beta 
slot bonus because you also have to have EQ1 with an active subscription 
to play.

I feel its pretty clear that they are trying to leverage our enthusiam 
about EQ1, and our natural interest in its sequel to move copies of an 
unrelated product. LoE, for all that its set in a 'Norrath' is not 
Everquest.

value is a complicated thing. There is how much "I" value something. 
There is how much something costs. There also a market value. And each 
party is cogent of all these values.

The key chain would have little market value if it were purchasable 
separately, it costs next to nothing, and is highly substitutable. I 
value it worthless.

The EQ2 beta has some market value if it were purchaseable separately. 
Hard to say exactly what, since betas are typically free. It has a cost, 
but its by-product of software development and it should be completely 
offset by the final retail sale of the product; so its net cost is 
really nothing. The value I place on it is probably around market value, 
which for the sake of argument lets place at 10.00

The RTS has has a market value on par with an average new PC title, and 
it represents a sizable cost to produce. Yet I also value it very low. 
However I recognize that it has these other values.

For the sake of argument, lets assume there is someone out there who 
values the keychain to the same degree which I value the EQ2 beta, at 
say 10.00.

Whats the difference between me and the keychain guy?
Individually. Nothing at all.

However the collectives we represent are entirely different. And we each 
recognize that, because we both understand how supply and demand work.

The keychain guy knows that the keychain is considered worthless by 
everybody but him, including the folks at SOE, and so he is prepared to 
bite the bullet and fork out the money to get it if he wants it that badly.

I, however, am confident that the EQ2 beta would be worth 10 bucks to 
thousands of people; we've established that it really costs nothing... 
so why is SOE failing to deliver at that price point. 1) Its not 
substitutable... nobody else can deliver the EQ2 beta... so SOE has a 
micro-monopoly. And 2) They have decided to tie it to a product that 
everybody recognizes is worth around 50.00 even though virtually nobody 
who wants the EQ2 beta personally values it at that price. They are 
trying to convince us to buy something we value at 10.00 by giving us 
something we don't want for an additional 40.00, but we know that its 
not a bad 'deal' marketwise.  The folks at EQ know we don't want it, but 
that we do want the EQ2 beta so packaging the expensive undesirable 
product with the inexpensive desireable one is 'slimy' and 'distasteful'.

The keychain guy however has no comparable situation. He has no reason 
to suspect that SOE is deliberately trying to charge him 50.00 for a 
keychain. It was an 'honest incentive', and its just unfortunate that he 
desires the keychain and not LoE, and he recognizes that. He also 
realistically beleives that if SOE heard a lot of feedback saying how 
great those keychains were they would probably make them available for 
5.00 bucks, to profit off an unexpected demand.

So that was a long way to get to the answer... which I didn't fully 
understand myself until I went through it: The reason it is different 
isn't based on the value of the ties. It is based on the motivation of 
SOE. Noboy beleives that SOE is trying something distasteful and 
underhanded with the keychain promo, but they are with the LoE promo... 
because at this stage they know damned well that there is an unsatisfied 
demand for EQ2 beta slots, and rather than make them available at market 
value they are trying to leverage it into unrelated product sales via 
tieing.

If the EQ2 beta was substitutable you know darn well someone else would 
be selling it at the 10.00 mark.

How is forcing me to buy unrelated products and services to get the 
product I do want adding value?

If X2 has a promo where I can buy it and get any red tag DVD for 12.95 
that's adding value... If X2 has a 'promo' where in order to buy it I 
have to also buy a red tag DVD for 12.95 that's tieing.

A beta is typically free, or at worst has some CD shipping and handling 
charges. EQ2 is giving theirs away (which is normal) but you have to buy 
a 50.00 dollar game to get it.

Now DT and others have repeatedly brought up that I can still get in 
'via the regular public beta', and that's true. But normal betas are 
limited affairs that are essentially lotto'd out, so beta entry is *just 
a prize*. But the LoE deal changes that dynamic... no longer is beta 
entry just a prize... now there are unlimited beta slots; its a regular 
unlimited product with a (now irrelevant) free contest on the side. But 
the regular unlimited product part requires that I buy a 50.00 game.

Your comments on monopoly: Well that depends on your point of view.

SOE does have an exclusive monopoly on EQ. Sure they don't have a 
monopoly on MMRPGs but that is only relevant if the products 
substitutable. To a significant extent MMRPGs are not substitutable... 
many people here want to play EQ not 'an MMRPG' they would not be 
satisfied with AO, or DaoC even if it was half the price. Many of us 
have years 'invested' in EQ in terms of characters, equipment, and 
friends... switching to AC2 is considerably more than changing what 
brand of jeans you wear.

Your comments on vital: That I agree with 100%, and which is why product 
tieing here is just distasteful, not illegal... as DarkTyger has said 
over and over again... if I don't like it I can just not buy it. No 
harm, no foul. (And he's right... but just because I can choose not to 
buy it doesn't mean I think its any less distasteful.)

Overall I agree with your comments. However, the traditional tying 
example is banks forcing you to have your life insurance etc with them 
in order to qualify for a loan. Clearly numerous companies issue loans 
and underwrite life insurance, so there is no monopoly... yet it is 
still illegal to tie the two products.
