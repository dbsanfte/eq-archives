I always loved my father for his incredible ability to explain things 
exactly like this.  I don't know how he did it, but ask the man about 
anything, and I'd walk away with a much better idea how it worked.

Cripes, even "why is the sky blue?" he could answer so a 3 year old 
would get it.

I think one of my prouder moments was explaining molecular structures to a 
3 year old to the point that he could explain it back to me.  And a 
certain ex of mine is so proud of her 4 year old for being able to tell 
monocots from dicots. :)

Don't underestimate kids, man, they're smart.  Really scary smart.
