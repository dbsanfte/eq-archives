around 3/4 of my EQ friends and fellow adventures of these last years have
QUIT everquest

and several more are planning on it

they list several reasons(and i switch to standard punctuation mode to
communicate this!):

1- A65 war friend says he is upset that his guild + alliance does not let
him tank big PoP encounters, that those jobs go to the 3 tanks that get
favored. He isn't going to quit that guild because it would be the same in
any other guild, that the "support tank" role is a sham.

2- After everyone's level 10 twink has full SS, then what? THEN WHAT?! <g>

3- PoP fuxxed everything up.

4- 4 years of med+cast or /assist = something on the order of
'googleplexically' redundant (no words....no words....shoulda sent a poet).
As an enchanter, i feel my game is much more complex, but that's only
because i often am in a position of leadership; a warrior who's job is to
mash taunt and read dostoevsky while playing eq has the same "i'm important
b/c my job is complex" feeling simply because other people are following.

5- Me, and these aquiantances - friends, people who let me play their accts,
people i don't talk with, et cetera - not all, but *most* of us feel like we
took a wrong turn somewhere in the guild-department. We spent enough time
online and have the /played that people in the top 3 guilds have, yet we
don't fit in there. We are all good enough, and if we get something like 10
aa's more, or finish 64, or finish our epics (looking at my bard friend
now), we would be able to app and at least join the feeder guilds. How did
we end up with people that are NICE and FUNNY and HELPFUL but ultimately
just not good enough at eq?

6- On my server, Fennin Ro, our high end guild situation is quite lame. The
one guild that is most likely the "best" is soooo arrogant that they won't
work with other guilds and take down the big mobs. Big mobs don't die on my
server (bear in mind, fennin is one of the oldest) until way after they die
on the other original servers. The other slots in the top 10, except for 2
low-profile guilds, are filled by guilds that come and go -- this month,
people have xx, and it will suffer hard in a few months, and patter out in
the next year while people join xx2. Rinse, repeat, the point is there is no
great advantage to being high end and seeing things in PoP versus playing a
lvl 45 alt and exploring zones that no one uses, like dalnir, dragon
necropolis, and other zones that are relatively surprising.

7- Starting an alt is not really an option. We've experimented with other
classes and if they fit our style, we would play them. There is no point to
relive the past though. Except on Stromm, that was a ball until the sheer
numbers (100+ in every 1-30 zone) became frustrating.

I guess i'm done listing. The other reasons I haven't mentioned are ones
you've all heard before. After years of this game, it is fact that it's a
chatbox. That's why it's addicting....people are great. Thanks to PoP,
rogues can tank, monks dont need to single pull, clerics can melee, and some
people have probably survived 10k falling damage. Gratz.

This post is not a flame.

It is just a game, and no matter what you think (I once feared I would be
the only person left playing, that everyone would sell their acct.s except
me, and I would have all the loot and no one to gloat with), the time when
you quit will come. I'm not telling you to quit. I understand how great it
seems. However, I have done all the things I wanted to do the first time I
picked up the box. I did all the things I heard were fun. Know what? THEY
WERE. I had a ball. My game is just about done though. I never won a roll on
anything, that's what blows; the /ran system IS a hoax!

Some people quit because they are morons ("Sorry, I didn't like the UI" or
"I got to 8 and I can't get exp anymore!" or worse, "I just can't STAND
grinding exp anymore and finishing up level x!"). Some people quit because
they must (heh, suicide much? divorce? failing in school?). For others, like
my chronies, it is just "that time" and there isn't much to it other than
that. The reason for this post? I want to know if we're a bunch of whiney
loosers (you know I'm not 100% serious; this post is not a troll/flamer
thing) or if there's something quite justified, beit either the server we
play on or the fact that we've been playing since the beginning, that makes
this game less and less stimulating. What's YOUR secret? If 3/4 of your
friends quit, would you quit too? Are you (looking at the veterans here)
also finding yourself bored?

The game has as much of an end as it has a beginning; it's what you make of
it. I'm not going to soapbox or anything, thanking people and sharing
"wisdom" since I'm not done yet, I just suspect my game is ending and want
to know, uncool as it is to repeat myself, what other people in the same
situation as me are doing / will do.

I shrug unknowingly.
