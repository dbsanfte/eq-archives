If that's true (and I have to wonder if you've ever actually
*surveyed* them to find out how successful they really are at
evading legal troubles, and *why*), then the reason is *not*
that they were successfully using the unworkable "I'm only
selling my time" defense.

Instead, they're either paying off the local cops, or the cops
prefer to spend their time busting violent criminals instead,
or those "services" aren't quite what you think they are.

For two examples of the latter, some are rip-off joints
(what are you going to do, run to the cops and complain you
didn't get the blowjob you expected after you had given them
your fifty bucks?), or they're sting operations -- for many
years here in Houston, there was a sleazy-looking place
near downtown that had a sign out front, "Oriental Modeling
Studio".  It looked for all the world like a "massage parlor".
It was actually a police sting operation, and anyone
stupid enough to go in there and expect sex for money was
promptly arrested.
