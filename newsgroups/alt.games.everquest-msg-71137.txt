Nice. I changed the XML values yesterday and launched EQ. I admit to
being suprised when the patcher started to download and had an
estimate of 32 hours for completion. Obviously I stopped the patcher,
but it leads me to believe you can use the old textures which would
help my POS PC a lot. Changed options back to true, fired up patcher -
no download and straight into EQ.

Now i just have to find my old CD's again lol.

Cheers,
