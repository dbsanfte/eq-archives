More difficulty to get the item => it is more valuable at a given rarity
=> less time to camp the item. You do run NBG when in groups with your
friends don't you?

This makes no sense at all. If you want the item, in either case you buy
it or you camp it (I agree TCC and NO DROP items are unredeemably bad).

The difference is that with TCC it is a fun expedition with friends,
without it is usually a long long long mindnumbingly boring solo
exercise in sitting in one spot.

Before this issue came up, I never saw anyone praising EQ's ultra long
camps, saying that that was the thing that made the game fun for them. I
guess I was wrong, there must be people who have so little to do with
their lives that they are grateful for the opportunity to spend 16 hours
in front of a computer screen doing nothing.
