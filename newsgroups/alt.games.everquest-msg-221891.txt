I don't know. I think more people than not roll up an alt because they 
enjoy most of the available content up through the levels rather than 
solely to level them up on par with their main. Trudging through some 55 
levels of drudgery just for the endgame would be a crazy notion for most.

Mudflation is more a product of growing supply. When a new expansion 
comes out offering cool new gear, that stuff is outrageously expensive 
(non-no-drop stuff of course). After everyone and their brother has 
quested or looted it, everyone and their brother then *has* it and its 
value drops like a rock. I really think some sort of item decay would be 
a good idea to combat this. Item decay should be linked to use, not age.

If that were the case, then eliminating the low levels altogether would 
be a spectacular thing. Of course EQ was going to change. That change 
doesn't not have to be so mudflationary though. The gear should be harder 
to obtain, otherwise, it's no fun in obtaining it. There is also the idea 
of making much more of the gear in the game NODROP.

The trouble here is that the questing and hunting is being removed from 
the process. Money is all you need, and often the most efficient way to 
earn it is to farm greens until you snap. That can't be the best way to 
design it.
