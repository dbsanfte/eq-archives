    I've been kinda browsing that "Too Many Classes..." thread, and an idea
I've had bouncing around in my head kept popping up as a solution to the
balance issues that pop up in EQ. This isn't a fix for EQ, but rather for
future games, and I notice that Final Fantasy Online has a variation of it
implemented.

    In pretty much all MMORPGs, you choose a class, and your abilities are
derived from your class. People complain about balance because a character
represents a time investment to them, one they do not wish to discard to
migrate to whatever class is perceived to be "best". But what if a character
was capable of being any class, and chose which playstyle best suited them?
Final Fantasy does this with multiclassing - you can always go back and
raise your other classes on the same character. A reasonable solution, but
it leads to a lot of slumming and a ton of time invested to switch classes.

    This is my idea. The game has no classes. All a player selects at
character select are race, sex, appearance, and distribution of attribute
points within preset levels for that race. In game, your character has
access to all skills, and can cast all spells. Imagine an EQ character with
1HS, Evocation, Alchemy, all the possible skills. They would raise the same
way as in EQ - through use, as the character goes up in level. However,
there's a catch: the items you use restrict which of your abilities you can
use. Instead of your class determining the itemization in game, the
itemization determines what the character can and cannot do.

    Example: let's use the four types of armour in EQ (silk, leather, chain,
plate). Someone clad entirely in silk armour would have access to all of the
game's spells. As soon as that person put on a piece of armour considered
leather class they would lose access to some of the spheres of spells a silk
caster has, as they are now better able to take damage and handle combat. To
use EQ spells, a leather class would lose mage-level pets, some resist types
of nukes/DoTs, etc. This would continue up to plate classes, which would
have a very limited set of spells which they could cast. They could,
however, cast these spells at whatever level they are. So if a 29th level
character was in chain, he could cast any and all spells, up to level 29,
which are allowed for a chain caster. This allows for the pure casting
archetypes that exist in a game like EQ - wizard (silk), druid (leather),
shaman (chain), cleric (plate). The same limitations would be placed on
abilities. So, assuming you wanted rogues to be a leather class, nobody
wearing chain or plate could use Hide.

    Something similar would occur with weaponry, except I envision weapons
restricting the maximum level of spells one can cast. So someone with a
weapon with a poor DPS rating would be able to cast spells up to his current
level. Someone with a higher DPS weapon would be able to cast spells up to
his current level less 10, say. So as you are better able to deal weapon
damage, you lose some of the versatility and DPS from spellcasting although
you can still cast spells. Even the best-geared warrior type would still
have access to the lowest level of plate-allowable spells, and depending on
what weapons he used could shift himself to more of a paladin-type in
practice. I see the same limitations being placed on skills. So, for
example, a player with a high DPS two handed sword may only Hide like
someone 10 levels beneath his actual level.

    The "nuture" part of the game is obvious: obtain gear to allow for
various combinations of abilities and tankability. Obtain levels to increase
overall power. At higher levels of the game, have various "specialized"
spells and gear (like the best Mage-level pet, or the best plate greaves) be
quested, so a character will have to choose to invest some time in a certain
path if he wants to be the best at that path. Once a character achieves
higher level, there'd be AA-type abilities to be gained. The real advantage
to that is long after a player maxes their power level on a given path, they
can continue to invest time in the character by gaining versatility.

    So, doable/been done?
