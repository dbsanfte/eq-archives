Last night, I started the patcher, it opened the splash screen and
then sat there and did nothing. When I disconnected my modem to reboot
the computer, it suddenly decided it had run a file check after all,
so I left the patch window open, reconnected and logged in. 
Tonight, it did the exact same thing - just sat there and did nothing.
However, I started it once, tried killing it, restarted it and still
got nowhere and then tried doing what I did last night, and
everquest.exe kernel dumped on me. (About to do what worked last
night, now)
