Veeshan's Peak.  Full of 60+ monsters, some of which see-invis.  Can't 
gate or teleport out.  You'll need two clerics, one of whom will be 
required to die and rez out, to retrieve your corpse.  I can't think of 
anyplace that is harder to CR.  Generally, if you have a body stuck 
somewhere really nasty, a necro or SK can summon you out pretty quickly.
