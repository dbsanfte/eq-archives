Ben you ignorant slut!

You are the one who said what you said.  It was wrong.  You are therefor
wrong.  I know you can't believe it because you are always right, but it
turns out you were wrong about that too.  Let me lay it out so you can
see what you are denying a bit easier:

"Xavier">Nor is it for little twits to brag about how l33t they are.

"Ben"
And here you're just flat out wrong. That's exactly what the channel
is meant to be for, and if that bothers you you're expected to turn it
off.

So at this  point we see you saying something wrong, you know,
incorrect.  The channel was not meant exactly as a channel for twits to
brag about how l33t they are and anyone who thinks that it was is just
as silly as you are.  The fact that idiots use it as such does not lead
to intent to create a channel exclusively for that purpose.  Well in
your mind it does, but that as we've seen before is not a place where
facts thrive.  

If you meant what you said you were wrong.  If you didn't mean what you
said then you probably shouldn't have said it and so were wrong for that
too.  If you insist on being wrong you really need a thicker skin
because folks can and will point out you have your head up your ass. 
That my chummy friend is exactly what usenet is meant for. <EG>
