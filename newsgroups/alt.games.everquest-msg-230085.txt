I love having a master looter, except for most pickup groups. Often, in a 
group that is camping a particular area, anyone who leaves before the 
rest of the group has to request a split right then and there (something 
that groups generally don't like to do for whatever reason) to get 
anything, and just misses out on items unless the group has been rolling 
as they go.
