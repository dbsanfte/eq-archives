Just out of curiosity, have you made it to Feerott/Cazic Thule zones yet?
Fee is as dark and dank as Toxx, plus it has a wandering ogre guard, one
deadly zone line (oggok), one that's seriously confusing for most people
with the average beggar's experience (Rathe Mountains) and Innothule Swamp.
If you make it to Inn Swamp you have to know to hang a left and hug the wall
to find SRo.  If you hang a right instead, there's Grobb.   Oh, and if you
miss SRo (possible, it's not THAT obvious) you'll run into Upper Guk.

Toxx is certainly ANNOYING for any good race.  Fee is absolutely TERRIFYING.
