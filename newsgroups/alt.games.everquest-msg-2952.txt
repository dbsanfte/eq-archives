A shade over three months into it, I have two characters barely over 20.  And it
pisses me off fairly often.  I'm trying to keep that under control, but it's
frustrating. There's tons of people running around, much like you, who are
getting to the high levels really fast. As much as I want to, I'm hampered by a
number of things that some other's don't have to deal with.  Such as:
1. Very limited playing time compared to some folks, though certainly more than
some others. This isn't a knock at anybody. It's just a fact of life that all of
us have different amounts of time avaialable to play.  I wish mine was more, but
that's just how it is.
2.  Complete lack of experience in Norrath, and not have the experience of
having "done it all before" to know the best places to make money and level. I
get a lot of good tips from guild mates, here, etc. but it doesn't replace first
hand knowledge.  Hence, I flounder around a lot, waste time, level and earn cash
inefficiently. All makes for slower advancement, since cash = equipment =
leveling help.
3.  Lack of previous high level (rich) characters to ubertwink my low levels so
they can zoom through the levels with far less danger than I face, far fewer
deaths, lost time and xp, etc.
4. Confusion about playing styles and options.  Had I been able to stick with my
monk exclusively, I think I'd be waaaaaaaaay further ahead right now, but I'm in
a dynamic duo thing with my IRL partner, and our schedules limit the amount of
simultaneous time we have on line to play our "mains".  (I don't mind that, by
the way. It's worth it to be able to spend time together in Norrath at the same
level.)  I then picked a wizard to run as my back-up character. It took me 21
levels to figure out that I'm incapable of soloing the wizard without dying so
often I usually finish the night with less xp than I started.  And finding a
group is effectively impossible, unless it's guildmates, and even then I'm sure
they'd pick other classes as a first preference if truth be known.
   I finally gave up and started a warrior. The number of levels I made in the
"/played" time puts the others to shame. I only wish I'd known this two months
ago. I might be over 30 already too. :-(
