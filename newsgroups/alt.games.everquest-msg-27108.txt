IF you are in an FFA group, and aren't getting your fair share, stand
up, and get yours.  If they want you to med, find a new group.  Every
time I've been in an FFA group, the corpses have practically rotted
before being looted, OR, the pulling was so fast that co-ordinating
looting of bodies was impractical.

Doesn't sound reasonable.  Autosplit is a stop-gap, NOT an automated
looting tool.

See previous comment.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
