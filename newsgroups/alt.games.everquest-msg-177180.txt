Just a small comment, if you're going to die anyway then die in front
of me. Much easier to do the rez and still save the rest of the group
if I don't have to find your corpse by some mob that'll probaby aggro
me and now we'll wipe and the rogue has to drag corpses, rebuff, get
new members because someone always leaves after a wipe, go back and
find someone has our l33t camp spot, petition a gm, he says he won't
do anything, get pissed and log off.
