Define low level. Of all the classes, the cash challenged necro makes
out about the best with the Temple of Sol Ro necro quests. But you can't
start them until a bit later in life. (Low twenties I think?) The
rewards are excellent for the work they take, and some can be done solo.

At *very* low (read, pre-10) levels, assuming you follow every other
necro and get the hell out of Tox, you could go to Freeport and do the
Janem and Rebby quests in W. Freeport. This will get you some great
faction, with no negative hits, both with merchants/guards and with your
evil bretheren in the tunnels with whom you'll have to do business for
your spells and such.

I haven't started a new character since they were put in, but a ton of
new noobie armor quests have been put in for most starting areas.
Already listed on alakhazam's., IIRC.  You might try there to see if any
result in INT caster armor. The melee stuff is quite good for the level
from what I hear.
