So now they know that someone using screen name X, which is not an
identifiable real name, and who has a fake return e-mail address, and
whose *two* posts to Usenet under that screen name have been innocuous
questions, lives *somewhere* in state Y, which has a population of
5,296,486 people.

Yes indeedy, that sure narrows it down.

No doubt about it, this newsgroup is just chock full of lurking
stalkers who are here for no reason except to learn how to find out
what state posters live in.

Except, of course, the message in question *wasn't* cross-posted to a
hacker group. But perhaps if you keep harping on it you'll attract the
attention of some of the hacker group people. That would sure help,
wouldn't it?
