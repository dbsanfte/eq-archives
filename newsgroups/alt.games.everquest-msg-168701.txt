Hello! My wife is a wild EQ addict. (Not that I am much better....) Anyways,
for the Holidays I want to get her a cool EQ related present. Checked out
the RPG store and it is not really her thing. Was thinking more in the line
of those 3-D glasses but we have an older cheap-o monitor. I can't even
figure out what brand it is to look up whether it supports 100MhZ refresh
rate. :-) Anyway, some suggestions would be appreciated!

Jeff
