Incorrect.  Basilisks, Lizardmen, Cyclopses, and Giant Skeletons all
can spawn at HG spawn points.  It's amazing how many HGs can pop when
everybody in the vicinity makes a point of killing everything on/near
the hill except guards and mobs from the Hasten cycle.  Of course,
all it takes is a couple of dedicated slummers to make it nigh
impossible for level appropriate toons to get at more than one HG
every 10 minutes or so.
