Thank you much for the information.  I appreciate it.  The reason I
did not post on the EMarr forums is because this newsgroup appears
there as well, and frankly I'd rather not fire up my web browser and
head there since I'm at work. ;)  Truly though, thank you for the
information.  I will look into SoM, as PoP was my favorite era for
raiding and I'd love to get back to it.
