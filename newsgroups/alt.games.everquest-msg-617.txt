Some advice on playing a ranger post-50:

Equip relatively slow weapons with a high dam/del ratio.
The Wurmslayer is a good choice.  Yes, your overall
damage goes down slightly because the per-hit bonus
kicks in less often, but you stay low on the aggro list
and will get hit far less often.

Likewise, don't cast too many spells or equip weapons
that proc too often.  My Fluxbladed Axe in the offhand
procs occasionally for 150, but it's not often enough to
make me the top aggro.  I also like to Snare and Immolate
to drop the enemy's movement speed and AC, but I
wait until battle has gone on for a little while before
doing this.

Do you know how good rangers are at keeping enchanters
alive during mez time?  A warrior can Taunt once, wait a
while, Taunt again, and hope it's enough.  A ranger can
Taunt, Snare, Taunt, Snare, and break mez with a nuke.
That'll get the ranger to the top of the aggro list and keep
it off the enchanter.  The ranger will need a few heals until
the warrior gets to the top of the aggro list, but we can
sure tank better than enchanters.

Rangers are fun to play, despite our poor defense.  Finding
ways to work around this weakness is the challenge.
Hopefully the impending end of the experience penalty will
give us a better chance to show our stuff.
