I find that when I am porting I put up the simple phrase /ooc Porting to
most Locations. I have found that I will have 1 or 2 ports out of 10 that
are people who can not pay. A lot of times I click invite and the port
button as soon as we are grouped. Upon arrival I SoW and buff and am usually
paid quite well. I feel that people do pay what is in there budget for the
port. The only thing I find annoying about being a Druid is that at times I
feel like the Fire Pot room. If I am not in the mood to port do not get
pissy with me.
