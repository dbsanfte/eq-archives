Looks like most of the previous posts have things covered about the game
play - just a few things to note.

Time zone:  Not sure where in the world your from but a few servers have a
greater/lesser degree of norther or southern hemi players - this makes
grouping at some times of the day/nite almost impossible.

As people have said a new server is perhaps the hardest place to start your
EQ life - either people have spent money to transfer themselves to the
server and are trying to be No 1 or they are very new and may not understand
how to group with you or even how to respond, ive met many people who talk
in say without understanding that the zone cant hear them.

Personally I love newbie levels, they can be fun - try doing some quests and
get the hang of your character - check the web for its strenghts and
weaknesses - eq.castersrealm was my sorce of knowledge when i first started.

Like anything pratice will improve your skills - a skilled player is welcome
in most groups - when you start to group find people you like - chat to them
and maybe you will add a few friends to your list - i have some from lvl 1
that i still chat to - this i feel is the coolest part of the game.

Ive played every class with some success , wizard I found be the hardest to
find groups.

Dont wait for others to start one - find something you want to take on and
/ooc Mage 4 lfm at orcs, need a melee and healer pst works a lot - some
newbies want to group but dont want to take charge - even with my enchanter
i was creating groups at 50th because some poeple just stick on LFG and hope
someone will organise them.

My goal in EQ is to have fun, i can do that at any level - ive never worried
about being X lvl, enjoy what you have at each level - after 40 days and
nights at Dreadlands you might fondly recall wandering through freeport
newbie zone :)
