Well, they do if you have the foresight to /report the chat window showing
what happened.  The one time something similar happened to me, that was the
first thing I did, was /report it, then I /petitioned.  In my case I logged
in, and immediately fell for 10000 damage in Neriak 3rd Gate.  My corpse was
nowhere to be found, even with the help of a necro.  I did get the rez.
