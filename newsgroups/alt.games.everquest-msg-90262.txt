Here's something you can do without a group...

At level 22, after you've gotten the spell "Invisibility vs Undead",
take the boat from the Freeport Docks out into the Ocean of Tears.

Get off at the first stop (Sister's Island).  In one of the
little huts there, you'll find Styria Fearnon.  Target her,
and say, "Where is Sentry Xyrin?"

You'll get in return:

   Sentry Xyrin shouts 'Heeelp!!  The evil undead on this isle 
           are overwhelming!!
   Styria Fearnon says 'What?  Why are you so concerned
           for Sentry Xyrin? She returned to Freeport last night right 
           before..   Oh!!  Oh, dear!!  Right before the storm 
           hit.  If she did not make it back to Freeport, 
           I fear she has drowned or is shipwrecked upon one of 
           the nearby islands!! You must find her!

Now swim over to the "gargoyle" island, the very rocky one
Southwest of where you found Styria Fearnon.  If you arrive
there soon, you'll find Sentry Xyrin sitting around down near
the shoreline.

You can chat with her if you like, and she'll tell you about
the Potion of Marr quest, but that's not why you're here.

Wait for her to run up hill, she'll eventually go stand
between the Spectres that cluster around the pillar at
the top of the island.

Wait some more.

NOTE:  The Gargoyles which wander the island may be quite
dangerous to you at level 22, look sharp and avoid them.
The skeletons may be good for you to fight, but be careful.
The Spectres will be certain death, don't walk to close
to them (but at least they stay put and don't wander, so you
don't have to worry about one sneaking up behind you).

Eventually, Sentry Xyrin will despawn (disappear), and you'll be 
able to see a little bag that she dropped on the ground right
where she had been standing.

Cast Invis Versus Undead on yourself, /con them to make sure
they now read "indifferent" to you (because of your invisibility),
then tiptoe up between the Spectres (they won't be able to 
see you), and pick up the "bag".

It will be:

    Deepwater Harpoon
    MAGIC ITEM
    Skill: 2HS   Atk Delay: 40
    DMG: 18   WT: 13.0   Dmg/Sec: 9.25
    STA+5  WIS+5  
    Class: PAL 
    Race: ALL 

Now get away from the Spectres quickly before your
invis to undead wears off, they'd eat you *very* quickly
if they saw you.
