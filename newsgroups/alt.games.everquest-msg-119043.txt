And yet, despite all the stories like this, I'm still working on my Wizard's
"Druid Disguise."
Thanks to the newbie armor quests in Freeport, I have a nice set of reddish
leather looking sleeves, gloves, and pants to go with my Shardstooth Flayed
Skin and Bearskin Boots.  :-)

Surprisingly yet, no one's asked me for SoW or any heals or buffs yet.  I
have been inspected a lot lately, though.

Maybe I need to start going /anon...heheheh....
