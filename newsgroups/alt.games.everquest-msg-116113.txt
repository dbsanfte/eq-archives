I've been saying that for years.  I'll probably get flamed for this, but I
was actually hoping that the anthrax scare after 9/11 was real, though not
so much for some genetic cleansing as to get the wastes of protoplasm in
Washington DC out of the way.

Anyone who might want to accuse me of being a nazi, I'm not racist or
anything, but I think stupid people need to be lined up and shot, whether
they're white, black, jew, satanist, buddhist, etc.  Breed some damn
intelligence back into the species, or at the very least, keep the
non-intelligent from breeding at all.

I personally am willing to die, but only if I know that there's a million
other people right behind me.

If I weren't so lazy I'd probably try for a bioengineering degree and a job
at the CDC.  Oops, was that an ebola culture I just forgot about in my coat
pocket?

Why do I have the feeling that the men in black helicopters are already on
their way....
