But they're not telling you to do that. You can use IE for the time it 
takes to apply and never launch it again. You don't have to even go to a 
different website. I went directly to the application site by typing in 
the URL of the one I wanted to go to to apply and when it was done I 
closed out without going to any other sites. It was like walking into 
your house, sitting in the living room, and leaving when you asked me 
to. That's it. They don't require you to switch browsers. They don't 
require you to turn off your good sense. They do, unnecessarily we've 
already agreed on that, require you to use a lame browser for 2 minutes. 
After that though we don't have to leave the house unlocked or cut or 
phone lines or shoot out our windows or anything.
