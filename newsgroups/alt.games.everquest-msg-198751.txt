LOL, Yeah it's a bitch to get into that booth, The reason i got in
without one of those cards is because I work at Sony Pictures so I 
use my ID, but this is what you do next time...

Those cards are in the E3 Daily paper that they have every day,
So grab about 20 copies and tear out the cards ( Yeah you'll look like
a rabid fan boy tearing those cards out but hey you'll get in) ,
Then go back inside and and find a booth that has a few black lights
or stand by the doors to get in, they use black lights the see if you
have a real E3 badge. Then just look at the cards and you'll be able
to see if it says "Acess Granted"  on it. The Access cards are not
that random usually they'll be like 20 in a row that will let you in
then another 20 to 30 that won't.
