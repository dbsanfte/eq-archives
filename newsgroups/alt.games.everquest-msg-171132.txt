}Erm... maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're saying here, but... you think

}he's God?

Naw, part of the case against David Koresh was that he was a pedophile 
with delusions of grandeur.  They even, so they claimed, had him admitting 
it on tape!  But it turned out to be a tricky little edit with some well 
timed static.  Sanjian is saying it was not ok to run over his house with 
a tank, given that he neither got a ten y.o. girl pregnant, nor claimed to 
be God.

}> I'd have to find the specific case, but there's an issue now where a

Menorah is more common, but the -proper- spelling is in a different

This case just bites.  Can you find a reference on it?  Who should we send 
nasty emails to? (Once we have a more complete account, that is.)  By 
Christmas scene, I assume you mean nativity scene?  I could see banning 
rampant Santas, Frostys, and Rudolphs just because they're so tacky.
