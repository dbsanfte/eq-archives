You want to know what causes an engine like Luclin's to REQUIRE 256 Mb of
memory but really NEED 512Mb and yet looks no better than its peers?  Yes,
that's right, sloppy code.  Typical bloody PC game developers...lazy.

When you look at what is demonstrably achievable with a console that has a
fraction of that RAM and compare it to SoL it becomes painfully obvious that
there really is no excuse for this sort of performance.  Just so you know, I
do speak from experience of game development and I'm quite aware of the
differences in architecture between a console and a PC and all that that
means but it still astonishes me that Verant/Sony have the bare faced cheek
to suggest that this is a "next-gen engine that needs a next-gen machine".
Bollocks.  This is a workaday hack of the Turok engine (yes really, check it
out for yourself) that some overworked coder did his final build of and
realised with horror that no amount of optimisation would get this puppy
running in 256 Mb.  Notice how close to release Verant announced that you'd
need 512 Meg for the expansion? Probably because they were hoping and
praying that they could do something about it before release or, even
better, they'd only just found out themselves. This is a half arsed
graphical shell teetering precariously on the mountain of pre-existing code
beneath.

I love the game, I think the designers have done a fantastic job, but their
programmers should be tied to the back of a truck and driven somewhere, all
the while screaming "games always drive PC hardware upgrades, I don't have
to write efficient code" And, before anyone starts, it runs okay on my
machine even with SoL installed but then it bloody well should given the
spec of my machine.  I'm just sick of hearing people trying to make excuses
for god-awful sloppy coding that we, as consumers, shouldn't have to put up
with.
