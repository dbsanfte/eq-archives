(Sorry, this is a bit long.)
(Also, has anyone used this technique at any levels above 14th or
15th???)

   I believe I disagree with the 'soloing is slower exp.' part.  At
least at 12th and 13th level for my enchantress.  I've been soloing with
my pet (It's not really soloing if you use a pet, is it?) in West
Commons.  I'm mostly taking on Young Kodiaks.
   I cast my dot and wait for the YK to get close.  As it gets to me, I
turn on auto attack and run straight through it and a little past it. 
It has hit me once or twice and my pet has started attacking.  Once I am
past it, usually far enough that it has turned its attention to my pet,
I turn around and face its back side.  I move up to attack range and if
it stays on the pet, I have a better chance of hitting it.
   If it turns to attack me, my pet has a better chance of hitting it
and while the YK is hitting me, it's not hitting my pet.  Also, the more
the pet hits it, the more the YK hates the pet.  The YK starts flipping
back and forth splitting its attention between the pet and me.
   When the dot is about to run out, I decide whether it's efficient to
step back and apply another dot.  My decision is based on if the YK has
a third or more of health left and on whether I have lost a bubble or
more of health or if I am below 60% health.  
   Usually, once they hit about 1/3 health or less, they start running. 
I usually give chase with my pet to help finish the YK off.  (As slow as
I run, I usually don't catch it, but I try.)
   I then loot and look for the next YK.  On the average, I repeat this
3 times before moving to the wall to rest/med.  I've usually only cast 4
dots for the 3 YKs so I still have about 30% of my mana left.  Enough
for emergencies.
   If I'm below 50% health, bandage to 50%+.  Three minutes medding,
recast my buffs and the buff on my pet and med back to full.  Another 2
minutes at most. That 5 minutes is enough to bring me back to full
health.
   That's 5 minutes medding/healing.  Say 6 minutes to find and kill 3
YKs.  Say another minute for misc.  That's 3 minutes per kill and each
kill is almost half a mini bubble of exp.
   I gained an entire level in less than 3 hours of hunting.  I also
used the med time and the meat to work on my cooking skill and the
Grizzly Skins in tailoring Bear Skin Potion bags (they make excellent
10-slot containers).

   What about over pulls or adds.  I HAD to learn parking skills.  My
machine is slow.  I can't out run a mob to save my life (pun intended). 
Even with a SOW, I sometimes can't out run mobs.  So I park the adds
till I'm ready for them.  If I'm getting low on health and/or mana, I
park them and then gate.

   I hope I can continue to use this in the levels to come, possibly
continue it with Kodiaks added when ever found.  I know that I will
eventually outgrow this area.  Are there any areas where this will work
and still gain good exp. for levels above 15th???
