If I am not mistaken (it has been awhile) there is a way to spawn him faster.
If your DE talk to Kizdean Gix in the commons (inkie that kills newbies very
easily) he will give you a note once you play the hailing game with him. Then
go into befallen and find Skeleton LLrod (think that is the spelling) He is on the

first floor by where the Sk with key one spawns. hail him and give him that note.
I think you only need to be indifferent with him. I have believe that will then
pop
Your mummy a little bit faster. If your good aligned you can just kill gix (fast
as hell
and hits pretty hard like most inkies but is around 22 level i believe) he does
have a
HT though so keep that in mind. Or you could have a lowere level Inkie do it for
you.
If I am mistaken on this quest someone inform me. Been awhile since I looked into
Befallen quests.
