From LD... I'd wait about 10-15 minutes... THEN ask the group if we need an
extra, before /OCCing for a sub.

The example you've given isn't so cut-and-dried...
I mean... LD to re-log (10 minutes)...
waiting for the Necro to find and drag (another 5)...
waiting on the rez before figuring it's a no-show (another 10)...
scrounging a port/SoW (5 more)...
this only leaves about 15 minutes to get back to an area whilst nekkid, that
killed him whilst equipped... not easy to do solo.

Guildmate should have been aware the Monk wanted back into the group and
should have passed that info to GLeader.

If I was the Monk, I'd be a bit ticked my guildmate didn't make the effort
to keep my spot... but then I'd be cussing up /guildsay a storm demanding
vengenance on the MOB that put me down in the first place (so I guess my
intentions would be pretty clear) *grin*
