[snip excellent write-up of classes]

Good job!  That inspired me to do a sort of write-up specifically
about shamans, pros and cons of each shaman race.  I've started shaman
characters of each race (Ogre level 2, Troll and Barbarian both level
6, Iksar level 10); granted, I don't have any real high level
characters so I'm sure somebody with more experience could do a better
write-up than me, but I'd thought I'd give it a shot.

Barbarian

Pros:  

*--"Good" race, can travel freely to other "good" race areas.
*--High strength and stamina.
*--Can slam.
*--Can wear both medium and large armor.
*--Second highest wisdom (only Iksar is higher).
*--Good newbie quests (wooly spiderling fungus quest for level 5
spell, polar bear skin quest for free armor).
*--While I've run into a few KS'ers and other jerks (depends, I
suppose, what time of day you play--I usually try to play at an off
hour when I do play my barb shaman), I've also run across some very
nice, helpful players here.  For instance, when I first started, one
player gave me a large lantern (a godsend for a poor night-blind
Barbarian).  Another time, after barely making it to the guards with a
train on me and losing consciousness, another player bandaged me back
up.  Another player once gave me a backpack.   And just the other day,
when I was making my way back to the entrance (I was in the area where
there are all those forks in the road and stuff), another player came
up and asked me if I could give him a bind; I said I wasn't able to.
He then asked if I could tell him how to get back to Halas.  I said,
"I think it's this way, follow me" and (with the help of my map of
Everfrost) managed to lead him back to close by the ramp entrance and
told him "There where those lights are, keep going that way, that will
get you back to Halas".  Well, just for doing that, he gave me 5
platinum!  I was speechless.

Pro and con:

Newbie starting area--you can level very fast here; however, most of
the creatures will aggro on you (except for decaying skeletons and
wooly spiderlings, but those creatures will help each other) and they
will all gang up on you.  I've seen more corpses laying around the
Everfrost newbie area than any other shaman newbie area.  However,
Barbs are pretty tough, and if you're high enough level (maybe about
4-5) you can easily take getting ganged up on and get great
experience; I've often found myself battling four polar bear cubs at
once without dying.  I remember my (then) level 4 Barb warrior (which
I haven't played in a long time) once getting ganged up on by about
10-11 goblin whelps/scouts and gnoll pups; it was wild--it looked like
this big pyramid of creatures all surrounding me!  I did get a couple
of buffs from shamans passing by, granted, but I managed to kill them
all off!

Also, you have to watch out for those damned vengeful skeletons!  I
hate those things with a passion--they've killed my shaman three times
already and almost killed her off another time (barely made it to the
guard) and also made life miserable for my warrior.  If anything, I
want to get my shaman or warrior level up enough just so I can finally
get revenge on those $%@*# things! ;-)

Cons:

*--Night blind, so you will need a light source (you can get the
Serpent Sight spell at level 9 which will solve that problem; however,
that spell is not available in Halas, but I believe you can buy it
from one vendor in the gypsy camp in Oasis, I'm not sure, or you can
ask a human character to buy it for you at the Enchanters guild in
Qeynos (they won't sell to Barbarians so you will have to ask a human
to buy it for you--don't know if there's a way to get your faction up
with them or not).
*--Everybody and his brother plays one.  I did a /who all Shaman
(race) for each of the shaman races last night.  For Ogre, I got 7
names, for Troll, 8 names, for Iksar, 18 names, and for Barbarian,
(list of 50--LIST CUT OFF, TOO MANY PLAYERS).  If you don't want to be
one of the crowd, play a different race than Barbarian.

Ogre

Pros:

*--High strength and stamina.
*--Can slam.
*--Can't be stunned from the front in combat.
*--Decent wisdom (only 3 points lower than Barbarian).

Cons:
*--Evil race; need to work on faction before going to "good" zones.
*--Newbie zone (Feerott) sucks; it's a better zone if you're between
levels 6 and 10, but before that it is pretty lousy in my opinion.  I
think that's why my Ogre shaman is only level 2, because I was so
frustrated playing there; I've heard people recommend that Ogres go
over to Innothule Swamp to level, so I might do that.
*--Large size can cause problems in dungeons unless you have a shrink
spell.
*--Having that stupid butt-scratching.

Troll

Pros:
*--High strength and stamina.
*--Can slam.
*--Regeneration.
*--Terrific newbie area (Innothule Swamp).

Cons:
*--Evil race; need to work on faction before traveling to "good"
zones.
*--Lowest wisdom of all shaman races.
*--Large size can cause problems in dungeons unless you have a shrink
spell.
*--(Minor quibble) No vendors to sell/buy from in Innothule Swamp so
you have to zone in to town to sell off your loot and buy stuff,
unless maybe you go to that vendor that sells disease spells by one of
the hands there; I haven't tried that yet.  (Barbarians can sell stuff
to the merchants at the ramp at Everfrost, but still need to go back
to Halas to buy food/drink).
*--Having that stupid butt-scratching.

Iksar

Pros:

*--Highest wisdom of all shaman races.
*--AC bonus.
*--Regeneration.
*--Swimming skill of 100 to start with.
*--Terrific newbie zone (several of them actually).
*--Good newbie quests (curscale armor quest, scorpion pincer quest).
*--Look cool--or at least I think so! :-).

Cons:

*--KOS everywhere, including other "evil" races, need to work on
faction to go to other places; however, one could easily spend levels
1-60 on Kunark if they wanted to, there are so many places to hunt.
*--Can't wear plate armor; however, I understand that some of the
Iksar-only armor is the best around--I'm sure a high-level player
would know much more than I would about this.
*--Can't slam.
*--Newbies have to watch out for the froglok slaves (usually three of
them) that hang out in East Cabilis near the entrance to Field of
Bone; they will gang up on you and the guards will not help you.
(They quit attacking you once you're at a high enough level where
they're green to you, but I make it a point to always kill them
anyways whenever I see them!)
*--Lower strength/stamina stats than other shaman races.

Anyway, that's it.
