 I'd wager it's the opposite. If nobody could solo, a lot more would've
quit years ago.

 The way to get more people to group is not to nerf the
easy/solo/whatever experience. It's to make group xp the better payoff.
Forcing all the level 60 people into 4 or so zones (if they want decent
xp) isn't the way to go about it. After all, people grouped in the
'easy' zones before. So now you're telling me I'm going to get even less
xp grouping in those same zones? No thanks. I'd say my xp days are just
about over.
