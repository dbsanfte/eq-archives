Aye, I have been wondering the same thing.  Thought it may be something to
do with my region since my wife's computer is doing the same thing.
We live in VA.  I am not familiar with the technology, but perhaps we all
share the same login server???

I just hope its up soon, because my true oportunities to play are few and
far between.  At least when I am prepared to spend the time and attention
which this game takes. :^)
