Not always. You don't know for sure. they could just be having changes
because the players are demanding it. Who knows, it may of happened with or
without DAoC/AC/Anything.

They could of felt like doing something, they reviewed the melee classes,
changed some MOB resistances, changed a bunch of how the game functions
battle wise. So what? Would that get my vote to go over to EQ? Will it be
listed as a feature that some non-player would see that doesn't have EQ or
any other game

Features
-We looked over the battle system, changed some things that you won't see
effect you untill 51+.
-We added a role-playing server, things were getting dull.
-Euro server was added, our other servers lagged and still do.

Hrm....
