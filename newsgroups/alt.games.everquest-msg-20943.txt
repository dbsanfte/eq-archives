As stated numerous times in the past. I am one off the apearantly lucky ones
that did get rich from fletching.
I did as you did, dumping most of my assets in raising my skills. I am now
182 and had 1200pp in the bank (before I blew it all on ry'gorr and forgot
to retain some to keep my business alive) solely from selling bows and
arrows.

Granted, it's difficult to sell bows, but certainly not impossible. And
remember if you play your cards right, the sale of one or two Shaped
Compound Darkwoods can bring in a nice 1kpp in pure profit.

Another good point is that the higher level your arrows are, the more you
get of them. Meaning that the insanely expensive silver tips yield 10 arrows
instead of the usual 5, making them not so expensive afterall.

Anyway, it can be done, there is good money in fletching. You just need to
work at it, as with any business really.
Just go out and advertise your skill. I make bows to order, that seems to
work well. This way you don't tie up your capital in a bow you can't sell
and your customers get the exact bow they want.

Go for it
