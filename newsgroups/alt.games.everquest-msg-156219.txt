I'm playing hate kite with a druid friend and her pet... and I'm not
all that good at it yet.  I'm also using a 18 delay weapon, 21% haste
item, 25% haste spell... a lapse of a couple seconds range means
a lot of "cannot see" spam, it seems.

When I cast one of the Yaulp spells, I have to stand still briefly,
and the mob is still moving, so you'll see periodic instances of
range trouble till I catch back up... and duration on that is only
what, 36 seconds or so?  Yep, gonna be lots of range troubles
even at my best.
