Suggestion: Go to mistmore in Lfay first and play there for a bit. At
24 it might still be xp, I forget. Just staying there a couple levels
around level 20 was all my druid needed to still be kindly to ring of
scale, which is gorenaire. THEN go back to dreadlands.

Suggestion #2:

Never use wolf form in dreadlands, its part of the newer "lowers it
one or more steps" areas so it makes you scowl again.
