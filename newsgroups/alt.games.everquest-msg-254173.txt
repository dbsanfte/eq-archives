If it works like the old planes, you should be able to be rezzed back in
even without redinging (someone actually got the minimum level, went to pof,
died, died 3 more times somewhere else, and got rezzed back in to test
this... worked fine. He's a better man than me.)
But you wouldn't be able to zone back in on your own, and at worst would
have to wait for corpse rot to drop your body in the rot zone.
