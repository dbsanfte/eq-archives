NPCs keep a queue of items that have been handed to them. So, whomever
hands in the last item needed for a quest receives the reward. So, the
process is: you hand in ring, then friend hands in remaining items.
Since he completed the quest, he gets the reward.

If someone has already handed in the gold and rapier, you will receive
the boots once you turn the ring in, since you completed the quest.
That's very unlikely, though.

You can even multiquest between characters on the same account. ie:
character one turns in no drop quest piece and logs out, then
character two logs in and hands remaining items.
