Absolutely wrong before the last "fixing the casters' AI" patch
that corrected the disparity between NPC caster level and
the ability of PCs to resist spells.

A level 60 could easily be charmed by a level 20ish NPC
enchanter.  Yes, they had a better chance to resist than
a level 25 PC, but magic gear and such didn't really matter
like it should.  Level didn't matter like it should.  I would
venture to say that a level 25 PC could never, NEVER
charm a level 60 mob, EVER!  But NPCs in Befallen at
level 16 could routinely stick necro dots on my 60
rogue with 150+ resists and my level 53 rogue with 130+
resists with alarming frequency.

It's fixed, now...or at least better.  Having a level 60
almost die due to level 20ish casters nuking in Permafrost
is embarrassing.  When their spells are hitting for full
damage every time, it doesn't take as long as you think.
Now it's a little bit more fair when I run in to Vox's lair
to clear the trash for the real raiders to see 20 resist
messages than 20 full-damage nukes.
