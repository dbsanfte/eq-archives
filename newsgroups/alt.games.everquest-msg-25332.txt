There's a difference between what's going on int he IC world and the
games OOC representation of what's going on in the IC world. IC-wise,
there could have been a major strike on Blackburrow, and the gnolls
are rebuilding or have called in gnolls from the field to reinforce
the numbers in their stronghold.

It's this thing called "imagination". If you have so much trouble
RPing in EQ because of such things, how can you possibly not have a
hard time RPing in general?
