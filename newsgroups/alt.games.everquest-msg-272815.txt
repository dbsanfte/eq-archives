The only good test I'm aware of showed that it was not streaky.  A
statistician analyzed the results of a large number of trials, and the RNG
itself was fine.

The places where you see streaky behavior are not due to streakyness of the
RNG, but rather due to the designers wanting those things to be streaky.
Spells, for example, have a higher chance of fizzling if you just fizzled an
attempt, so you will see lots of back to back fizzles, or worse.
