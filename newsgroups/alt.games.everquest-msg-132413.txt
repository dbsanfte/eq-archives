I realize it's funnier to rip someone to shreds who doesn't
know everything about his class by level ~14 and then post
it to a newsgroup, but you could also consider having
empathy for the human being on the other end of the
keyboard/monitor and trying to help him understand the role
of his class within a group and become a better player.

Did you know what mez and root and blur and dot and dd meant
when you first started EQ? I'd wager for 99% of players, the
answer to these is, "no." Eventually, either you figured it
out by watching, or more likely, someone was nice enough to
explain it to you without assuming you were an idiot.

There's an often overlooked difference between ignorance and
stupidity.

(Worst case scenario, how is having an enchanter who doesn't
mez worse than having no enchanter? At least he's doing
damage. =p)
