Funny you should mention that.

In addition to the studio I actually live in, I have a house out in the 
country, where I store all my dead and dying computers.  And my ex-wife, 
at the moment, but that's another story*.

Anyway, until recently, that house -did- have a functioning computer in 
the bathroom.  It was only an 8080-based machine with some ancient 
version of Word Perfect on it.  I used to have some massive drunken revels 
out there, and it proved amusing to find out what inebriated people would 
type while in the loo.

That computer's since been recycled, though.  It's going to control some 
thermostat here in the lab now.
