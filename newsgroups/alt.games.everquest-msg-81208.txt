I dont think feeling a bit sad and saying "oh well, it was a violation,
what can you do?" qualifies as "going apeshit". Not unless you're *reeeallly*
very sensitive ;)

See, I dont see "thousands" of people every time I login, and of the ones
I do see maybe 1 in 50 has a "stupid" name, and another 1 in 20 has a name
that would fall foul of the naming rules.

Its just not that uncommon, and thats part of the issue - the inconsistency
of enforcement making it a tool for petty vengeance rather than a rule that
actually contributes to the high fantasy nature of the game.

I think she pretty much played it like she'd played final fantasy. Logged in,
soloed, explored, looked at the pretty sights. She's remarkably good at the
game, in terms of mechanics, but really regrets having missed so much of the
low level communal interactions now she understands what its all about.

If you come from a background where you've never roleplayed, never played a MUD
or multiplayer game, your background is TV and consoles, EQ is a pretty big
break with tradition.

You might not be able to imagine how she did it, but it doesnt change what
happened ;) I know for a fact she *still* doesnt read things like 
castersrealm or eqvault, which I occasionally browse now, because, well, she
likes to login , talk to her friends, and find more entertaining ways to spend
her time online.

Each to their own ;)
