What're your wis and int?  The 40pp I remember being quoted back early in
the game, it may have changed since then.  Whatever the figure is, it'll
assume

a) that wis/int is respectable, but it doesn't need to be maxed (along with
any primary stats, ie strength for smithing, etc.--I can't remember if there
is one for pottery)

b) that your charisma is good

c) your faction with the merchant is good (not apprehensive)

d) that you trained up the first 20 points with your trainer, and

e) that you're firing and reselling (I *think,* it may not be worth the cost
of the sheets)
