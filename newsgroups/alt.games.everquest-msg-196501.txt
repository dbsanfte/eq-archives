I don't remember that.  The only complaints I recall about removing
the book, other than tongue-in-cheek "we had to walk uphill both ways
through neck-deep snowdrifts in the blazing sun" stuff, was that it
made it too easy for soloing casters.  And that was only when they
completely removed the book, I recall nothing but cheers when they
first removed it for L35+ (I'm sure somebody musta bitched, but I
didn't see it).
