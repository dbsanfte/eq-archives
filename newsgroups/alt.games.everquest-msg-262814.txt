In a heartbeat. The bane of EQ, IMO, is mudflation and purchased pp 
exacerbates that. This would do away with both.

I would much prefer it be on a no-transfers basis.

Never been one for character transfers. I suppose cost has always been 
the primary factor though - that and the prospect of losing everything I 
have and re-equipping from scratch (again, unless I pay an even *higher* 
transfer fee).

Doubt it. That wouldn't make a big difference to me, as most of my gear 
is still droppable. Again, I think it should be a no-transfer server.
 
My only concern would be the fact that the in-depth knowledge today's 
player has on the game would likely cause huge backlogs at the good drop 
camps in the race by many to get back to raiding status asap. It's ironic 
that that is an actual upside to the mudflation and purchased pp problem 
on other servers. It tends to lighten the load at some of the decent 
camps as people leapfrog them in the first place by simply buying the 
equipment in the bazaar. :/
