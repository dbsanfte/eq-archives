It was my mistake when I wrote BB for Butcher Block. I just didn't know.

Got on a boat at the dock in Butcher Block. I had no idea where it was
going. While I was looking around for someone, the boat takes off. I stop at
the first island to buy some water and the boat takes off again. I'm left
there fishing for a day. Another boat comes along and finally takes me to E.
Freeport. I cannot find my way out. Get back on another boat which takes me
to an island of female warriors. While nosing around on the island, someona
attacks me out of the blue and kills me. I don't know how long my corpse
will stay there, butI can't go back there tonight. It's a real bummer
because I had invested a lot of time getting his quest armor. I have a
feeling if I don't recover, I'll have no chance a getting another set.
Sometimes this game is pretty cool, but if you can lose everything just like
that, I dunno. Not much fun tonight.
