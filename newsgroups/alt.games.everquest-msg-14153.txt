Yes, whenever you are in combat. It will only rise against something that
gives you exp (ie is actually some risk in fighting)

Your skill should be 15, if you put 3 points in it (1pnt will give you the
skill at the lvl the skill was available, 13 + 2 others...I think)
Dual wield works like this,
Everytime the weapon in you off hand can make an attack (dictated by it's
delay) then a skill test is made, if successful you attack with that weapon.
This is why people will normally place the faster weapon in the off hand and
a heavier hitting weapon in their primary hand. Also the quicker the off
hand weapon is the more tests are made the faster the skill will increase.
You may want to put the piercer in your primary every once in a while to get
your skill moving with that, not much good have a secondry weapon that only
attacks every so often and then misses :ï¿½)
