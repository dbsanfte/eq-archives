Contrary to the rumors that were flying, level 60 experience was not reset.
Lots of people logged in, finished up a half a blue, then dinged 61.

Considering you could even fill your exp bar beyond the maximum in 60, some
did not even have to kill something, just activate the expansion.  If you
were putting more than 10 percent to AA, you could be half way to 62
immediately after the patch, even.... depending on how long you had been AA
exping that way.
