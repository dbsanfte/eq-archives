Hmmmm... I've never gone straight for the nexus block for any prolonged
length of time.  I suppose anything is possible.   I did have one time where
I was swimming against the corner in the pool (north east if I remember
correctly) and walked away for a bit, when I came back I was under
a bridge with no way to get out.  Near as I can tell I some how "popped"
over to the bridge leading to PC.  I had gate and so I was able to get
back, but it was weird.
