Even that sounds more like someone claiming belief that there
isn't a name policy, than someone who's thumbing their nose at one.

Or at least, someone who started a character without knowing the
rules (be honest, how many of us read every "player conduct" rule and
regulation before we dove into the game?), and then only got belligerent
about it after other players informed them that they were pushing
the envelope, and why.
