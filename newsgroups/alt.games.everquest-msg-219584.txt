   Hehe.  Anyone else think of that old ad series where one character would say
to another in a crowded area "My broker is (? Merrill Lynch?) and they say...."
and then suddenly all actively around then would stop as everyone else froze to
hear what the broker had said? 

   I don't want to have that kind of power.  I would be too tempted to say stuff
like "Eat creamed corn for breakfast _every_ day!".
