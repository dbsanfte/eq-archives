I remember.  Way too well.  I went through like 10 different characters
up to lv 7 before finally settling on a shaman, played her to 35 before
Kunark Came out, after playing all day every day for 3 months at lv 35,
never able to get in groups, guk was crowded to the gils. I gave up on
her and started an Enchanter.  Things were much easier as kunark came
out when I was about 19th, so I got breeze, she's lv 53 now.  

I just started over on Firona Vie, no nothing.  It was fun up to about
lv 8, I'm lv 10 there now.  I did that in 3 days (real time, after work,
not played time).  Just not as satisfying as the old "oh shit!" days, I
still don't have any money and am scraping to finish buying my lv 9
spells, but everything is sooooo much easier.  Hell no corpse retrieval
until 10th lv. even.  I think meditate is working when sitting instead
of staring at the book too.  Sheesh they are making it too easy on the
newbies :)
