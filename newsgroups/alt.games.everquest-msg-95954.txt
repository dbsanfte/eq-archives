I can confirm that both a human and a barbarian (and a half-elf and a
high-elf) can wiggle through, since my friends and I have started
hunting there lately.

For anyone who wants to know how, you point yourself at the triangular
hole in the rock just under the water line, and then duck and unduck
repeatedly until the view "changes" a bit (you see more water).  Then
you turn left and a bit up and you should be through.

Takes a bit of practice and some form of EB would definitely help
(although it isn't essential) just so you don't feel under time
pressure.
