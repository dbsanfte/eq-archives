Nice that this ~finally~ posted. I wrote it two days ago... *sigh*

Well I have since gone there, and found that the lag happens about
once a fight or so and just hangs there for about 4 to 10 seconds or
so. Gives you a breather to consider tactics, but other than that it's
only mildly annoying. Gives no real advantage or disadvantage to
anyone.
