Nu uh. I missed it but you could do it from out of aggro range,
and most of the stuff in maidens doesnt summon anyway. If something
was above/below the usual limits rather than getting "your target
is too high/low" you could fire at any distance, and had a delay 0
bow.

Archery mastery 3. Trueshot. XP.

Sigh. I'm amazed they didnt get banned, but I'm envious of the AAXP
points.

Imagine solo clearing maidens.
