I visited there once.  Damn Griffin wasn't at all amused.  Fortunately, I
had bound myself in Freeport, so I didn't have too far to go to recover my

I mean, Geez, what did I ever do to him?  He was red to me, so I left him
alone.  He was not so "generous".  Not to self, "Give griffins wide berth".
