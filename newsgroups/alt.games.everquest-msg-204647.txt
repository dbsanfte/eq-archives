There used to be a bug when you did something that gave more than one
faction hit when one of the factions was at its max or min value.  I don't
recall exactly what the bug was, but I *think* it was something like you
would get no faction hits if any of the factions was at its limit.

E.g., suppose you are near max faction with "Knights Who Say Ni", but are
KOS with "Annoying Bridekeepers".  You are trying to raise "Annoying
Bridgekeepers", and are killing something that gives positive faction to
that an "Knights Who Say Ni".

When you hit max with "Knights", you would stop getting both "Knights" *AND*
"Annoying Bridgekeepers" faction.

If that was the only thing that raised "Annoying Bridgekeepers", you were
screwed, unless you went out and trashed "Knights" faction.  If everything
that trashed "Knights" faction also trashed "Annoying Bridgekeepers", you
were permascrewed, whereas people who started out KOS to both of those
factions could perhaps get non-KOS to both.

This bug greatly complicated faction work, because a faction you didn't care
about one way or the other could be very important, by simply being on the
same mobs/quests as factions you cared about.

Before people knew about this bug, a different theory on how factions worked
arose, which explained most of the observed behavior.  That theory was that
faction was stored as three numbers, rather than a single number: your
base faction (race + class + religion + spell modifications), your net
faction gain, and your net faction loss.  Whenever the server needed your
faction, it would add these three together to get your current faction.
Under this theory, if you did something to hurt a faction, and then did
something else to repair that, you were NOT actually back where you started.
You had increased both your net gain and your net loss, by the same amount,
so your faction in game was the same.  However, you had moved both the net
gain and net loss closer to their caps, and when you hit the cap on either,
you could no longer ever move the faction in that direction.

That actually would be a cool way to implement factions.  It would mean that
for any faction, you could trash it, and then undo the damage (assuming
their are mobs or quests that give the appropriate hits), but you could not
switch back and forth too many times.  Eventually, you hit a cap on net
gains, and then can only lower it (assuming the cap on lowering is higher
than the cap on gaining, which it probably would be).

I don't recall when Verant fixed the bug, but it may have been for Velious.
