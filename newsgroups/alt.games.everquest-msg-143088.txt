If you get any answers I'd love to know. I get LOTS of those blue screens (which 
MS politely now labels as "Stop Errors"). I get varying stop error references, 
but so far the ones I've checked for information on the net all mention something 
about an "IRQL that is too high". I've gotten the IRQL_IS_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL that 
you've gotten, also BAD_POOL_CALLER, and some others. I don't always see the 
exact message or the file it sometimes lists because for some reason MS made the 
error messages scroll to the bottom automatically with no way to scroll up, 
therefore I often miss the beginning of the error.

I'm using Windows XP. I can honestly say I NEVER had a crash of any sort while I 
was using my old Pentium 3 system and Windows XP. Unfortunately with a CPU 
upgrade often comes a motherboard upgrade, and in my case that meant a memory 
upgrade. So I am now running an AMD processor on a new motherboard and new RAM, 
and I get crashes a lot. I purchased a new hard drive recently hoping that a new 
install would help. My XP install was originally upgraded from ME without a 
format, then I upgraded all that hardware and used only the repair/reinstall 
feature, again not a format. I figured the OS stability was decreasing from all 
of this, but upon a brand new install nothing is fixed. The old drive used FAT32 
and the new one is on NTFS, so those don't matter apparently.

I get them randomly when playing EQ or other games. I also sometimes get them 
when just doing everday things on the computer. Until recently I didn't have 
anything specific I noticed would cause it. Just a few days ago, however, I 
decided to put up some simple pages with EverQuest pictures of mine ( 
www.thalunatik.com/eq ). I can write HTML but for something simple I find it 
easier to use FrontPage. Makes things like tables quick and easy and still gives 
me access to the HTML code. In any case I can notice a huge increase in the 
occurance of these blue screens when either using FrontPage or, more commonly, 
just after closing FrontPage. I don't know what the relation is, could it have to 
do with my NIC? It's a 3COM 10/100 3C905B-TX.

It's really frustrating, I'd love to know of a fix.
