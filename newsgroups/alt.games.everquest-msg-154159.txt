Hee hee on Xev for the first month or two after bazaar opened you
could always find this one guy in there trying to sell LSoEE for 32k.
As most people know LSoEE was one of the items that collapsed in
price, you could usually get one for 10-18k depending on the volume at
any given time. But this guy never changed his price one iota.

As far as I know he might still be trying to sell it.
