Dragon Steak
doesn't trivial until at least 170 skill (which is  a LOT for baking, only
it and pixie powdered cinnesticks go this high)
4 to all stats, takes dragon meat, off a rather largish, um, DRAGON, and
some of the Othmir baking ingredients.

And I would guess that you could make a bit of money on the foods that give
+resists outside places where that resist is in demand for a raid, EG fire
resist outside Naggys lair, cold resist outside Permafrost, and poison
resist outside Seb.
