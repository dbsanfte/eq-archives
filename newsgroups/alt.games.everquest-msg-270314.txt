My experience with AO was very positive as far as being a newbie.  The only
real reason I left AO was that I decided that I preferred the fantasy genre
for my MMO games.  Though cancelled, my AO account is still active.  It's
been a while since I've patched or hit the forums.

My suggestion would be to go to Jobe with your first character ... the newb
garden there is the most similar to what you'll be familiar with from EQ.
If your client doesn't come with Shadowlands, then it's six of one, half
dozen of the other.  The RP folks really play up the Omni/Clan chatter from
time to time.  Omni will have access to better gear, Clanners seem to have a
lot of fun working the 'Rebel' angle.  Folks who start out as neutral
generally don't stay that way for long.

You'll see some familiar stuff.  LDoN was lifted straight from the AO
mission terminal concept.  I was running instanced missions in AO long
before LDoN came along.

Funcom's CS is first rate ... the gold standard IMO.  You'll get a visit
from an ARK (AO's version of a GM) in your first few days just to check on
you .. make sure you're adjusting to the environment and answer any
questions you may have.

It's a fun game ... based on your posting history, I believe you'll enjoy
it.
