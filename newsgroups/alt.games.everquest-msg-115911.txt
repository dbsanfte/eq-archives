random on loot would never work for my guild, and I would never want it to
be that way.

theres a lot more to merit based loot you know (or at least there can be).

We have class forums and class leaders - the class leader gets a good idea
of loot/needs for the guildies of that class, both from self knowledge, and
wish/need lists we make on our member boards.

We also help ourselves (most of us..) by only sending /tells on loot that is
a REAL upgrade for us.

That doesn't mean send a tell and ask for a lesser item in the meantime,
thats a waste when nodrop loot gets banked.

A new applicant guildie really really wants a cowl of mortality - for
whatever reason, he sent a /tell on a dain crown and was awarded it.  As a
result, he's gone from next on the cowl list (a very high chance of being
next, anyway) - to somewhere near the very bottom.

Don't shoot yourself in the foot.. don't be greedy.. and you can have very
few complaints about loot
