Not necessarily, EQ1 still has a pretty large subscriber base (yeah I've
heard all the doomsayers out there saying it's going to be a ghostland
'soon' but I think it still has legs). I think Sigil will draw pretty
heavily from them and from the people like me who liked EQ up until the
most recent guild uber alles mentality they went for. And WoW isn't all
it's cracked up to be. I didn't last the free month and am back to EQ2
after seeing for myself the problems: overcrowding (not so big a problem),
lag (problem), some CTDs (big problem), consolish gameplay (big problem -
and why they should do ok). I know for sure they'll get a month out of me
and if Brad can do the same thing as in 99 I may stay for years (again).

"I believe everyody in the world should have guns. Citizens should have
bazookas and rocket launchers too. I believe that all citizens should have
their weapons of choice. However, I also believe that only I should have
the ammunition. Because frankly, I wouldn't trust the rest of the goobers
with anything more dangerous than string."
