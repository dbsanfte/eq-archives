Seems you didn't get my point:

That would be alright with me, I would prefer this to people asking newbies
to say "please" before they help them and watch them die while they
struggle to type please while being trying to run from a mob.

> neck, or killsteals you, or trains you, because of "roleplaying" reasons.

That's where I think you missed my point: How would a killsteal be any
roleplaying? Well - person get's the loot, people start ranting. Yes,
there is some point to that you offend the person of the other race/class.

But the point is _they_ started being a jackass - I would've been
just fighting my mob.

If lighties come onto _my_ homelands earth and start butchering _my_
kindred, that more than justifies calling the police (guards) on them
in my eyes.

Normally I go out of my way to find excuses to help the "good folks"
as well - but I will not betray my kindred to the point as to watch
others slaughtering my people.

But - Verant would not get the point of this issue - which wouldn't
even need a single byte of new code, just a slight change in the
guidelines for guides/GMs - so I will have to watch and grind my
teeth while I think of some imaginative verbal abuse that does
not fall back on "worldly cursewords".
