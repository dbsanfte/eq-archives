But how do you what the appropriate ingredients are?  The original
design was for players to figure out what ingredients made what items.
To do that you have to be able to cycle through individual pieces and
select what to combine them with.  I think this is a requirement or it
loses much of the attraction, it's all about the journey right?

However, it would be nice to be able to make a recipe once I figure
out the combination and save that to a button or command.  Then I
could practive that same combination over and over without being a
click monkey.  But the click monkey is necessary in the beginning I
think.
