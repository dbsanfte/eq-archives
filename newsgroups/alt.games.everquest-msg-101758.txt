Never underestimate the value of a good mana battery. ;-)  And DMF rocks
for many situations in dungeons where the terrain really sucks, plus
it's other bonuses. Beyond that, you still have some nukes to contribute
for the total raid damage outlay. (The best? No. And you can't use some
of your best because you'll annoy the tanks when the giant size creature
is suddenly a tiny skelly) but still some nice nukes. Far from useless.
