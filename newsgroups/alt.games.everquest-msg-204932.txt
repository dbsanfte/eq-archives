To figure DPS you would have to know the level, skill, and buffs
(ATK, STR, and especially Haste) of the attacker as well as the
AC of the defender.  Really, the only meaningful DPS numbers are
those measured in play.

If what you are after is to compare two weapons, try:
((dmg * X) + Y) / dly
"X" is a fudge factor ranging from 1.5 to over 2.0 depending on
character level, STR, and ATK bonuses.  Use 1.5 for am untwinked
Paladin under L50, 2.0 for buffed L60 Ranger, Monk, or Rogue.
"Y" is your level-based damage bonus, [(level - 25) / 3] for 1h
weapons and variable based on level and delay for 2h weapons.
*NOTE* this is for comparing primary hand weapons for melees,
for secondary hand weapons or for non-melees just compare dmg/dly
ratios.
