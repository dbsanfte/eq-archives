What the fuck?

The epic 1.5 is aimed at light raiding guilds  ie elementral level guilds 
that are supposed to be able to do these fights.

I just attempted the DN1 fight for my bard epic 1.5 yesterday and we had our 
asses handed to us. we had  3 groups from my guild and 1 group from the 
highest guild on the server (just gained access to Tacvi) and we died hard 
and fast.

Everything went fine until Vesthon depopped and the Abomination spawned 
(dracoliche model). Now this guy hits for 1300 and is slowable. He also has 
a huge AE rampage which has up to 6 hits of 500 damage. Standing at max 
melee range still puts you 20 feet inside the rampage.

Oh and did I mention he is a belly caster too?

Add to that having to cc 3 level 70 adds which are unmezzable (rootable 
thank god) and this is a very hard fight for people with our level gear.

How the fuck I am going to do the 2nd fight is beyond me as this is a much 
harder fight as the main mob hits for 1300 and AE ramps for 1300 with an AE 
with a 500 point dot and snare which is unresistable...

Thanks sony...I was really looking forward to the title of Wyrmkin. Now I 
will have to wait until I can persuade the top guild to do these encounters 
for me.
