At level 8, kill all the spiderlings you see.  With a sewing kit
you can combine 2 spiderling silks to make silk threads.  Why
do this? Free way to pump up your Tailoring skill.

Kill some spiders or buy some spider silks.  2 silks combine
into one swatch.  One swatch + any tailoring pattern will
make a piece of Raw  Silk armor if successful (tunic needs
2 swatches + tunic pattern).  All casters can wear Raw
Silk, and it's a nice upgrade from cloth.  It's not an SMR
or anything, but then again, you don't need much more
than Raw Silk for a while.
