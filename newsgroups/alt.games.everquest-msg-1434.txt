I can't get more than 24K baud connection where I live and playing EQ
can realy suc especially on big raids where lag is even more than
usual.  So, under Win98 there is the option to use two modems, if you
have two phone lines and your ISP lets you connect more than once.
Will it works great and I get 48K connections but with EQ it is
extremely unstable, often freezing after a few min.

Does anyone using dual modems with EQ and if so, how did you get it to
work.  Thanks for any help... Don't bother telling me about all of the
other high speed connections, none of them are available here unless I
get my own T1 line.

Thanks.
