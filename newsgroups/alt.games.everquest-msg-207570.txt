I had a similar thing happen after my Rogue died between zone lines and
had to have his corpse summoned by a GM. Since then it runs noticeably
slower for some odd reason. With the help of a few guild mates, we
tested a few scenarios and found the following. Naked, all other alts
easily outdistance the Rogue. Moderately encumbered alts can also pull
away from the naked Rogue. SoW'd, the speed differential is magnified in
favor of the other alts. I have petitioned this and sent email to
technical support, but nobody can see anything wrong. I guess I
accidentally rolled up a severely arthritic character! I've resigned
myself to waiting through the next few patches to see if anything
transpires, then delete and start again if not.
