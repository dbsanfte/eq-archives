Ok, I may be way off here but Rhand is from War of the Powers (?) he's
actually a villian (although in the final part of the second book shows more
heroism than the hero himself) and is loosely based on Micheal Moorcock's
(Unfortunate name) Elric, where, coincindently your Surname is from :�)

If I am right, then they are excellent books, great tongue in cheek fantasy.
If I'm wrong...well erm, anyone tell who I am thinking of.

When I first started playing I tried to make a character called Severian,  a
character from books I read when I was a about 16. I thought that the books
and character were obscure when it was pointed out to me that Gene Wolfe's
Book of the New Sun was considered a bench mark for Sci Fantasy literature,
oh...I had no idea :�)
