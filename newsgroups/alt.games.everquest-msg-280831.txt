Well, I rarely had any difficulty with that run at level 1, it's all 
about watching where you are going.

There were some problems with the boats at times, although I can honestly 
say I never had any of those issues.

Players could be bound at any city.  A few additional bind points were 
added later.

I think we all understand that you did not, or would not enjoy EQ prior 
to many of the changes.  I don't have an issue with that, I have 
differnet preferences.

You don't even have that choice anymore.

You are certainly entitled to your opinion, just as we are to ours.  I do 
honestly think EQ was better before they made it so easy.  I wish they 
had not changed EQ, but rather left players who were looking for 
something easier to go to other games.  I do still enjoy playing EQ, and 
I have tried some of the other games, and EQ is still better in my 
opinion, but it is not as much fun to play as it used to be for me.
