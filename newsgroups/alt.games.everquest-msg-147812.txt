We did this not too long ago to get to 7th isle for mage crowns.

You need a cleric/pally/necro and a necro/sk on the 7th island, or whatever
destination island.

You need to get grouped with the necro/sk.  Several ways to do this.  One,
have a wizard on destination island that is grouped with the necro/sk,
wizard jumps off, ports up to first island, invites people who need to be
moved.  Two, necro/sk dies on 7th island, gets ported up to first island,
invites someone, makes that someone leader, gets rezzed by
cleric/pally/necro back to destination island.  Probably other variations
possible.

Get yourself killed where you are, duel can be a bad idea, I hear it agros
all sorts of fun stuff.  We did it by attacking one of the npcs on the first
island.  Necro/SK summons corpse, cleric/pally/necro rezzes.  Remove from
group, lather, rinse, repeat, until everyone is there.  Camp out
cleric/pally/necro and Necro/sk so bridge will remain intact if you want it
for future use.  You can camp just the rezzer, as, if the necro/sk dies, the
rezzer can rez him back to be camped at the end of the raid.
