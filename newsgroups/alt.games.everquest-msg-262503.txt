Geeze, its not too good at it.  If I was the devil, I'd be walking round 
with a contract offering to sign people up in exchange for a mortal life 
of ease, with cash, food, sex, whatever.

Push some pixels around on a screen a few hours a night while chatting 
with my friends?

But since I'll be dead at the time, I don't see how I'll care.  Nor do I 
see how you could possibly know.  Seems to me every single afterlife 
postulate anyone comes up with is no more than a guess.

I'll guess one for you: When you die, you wake up to the real reality, 
which includes a display of some sort asking if you want to play again.

If its hell, then you can't, you have to go do your homework in 
celestial mechanics first.

But I'm trying to avoid my celestial mechanics homework, and besides I 
thought Suicide was a sin?  Oh wait, you meant EQ.  Well, still, I'm not 
pulling out on some troll's unsubstantiated sayso.  Get me a witness, 
say someone who died but got revived, and says that when he went towards 
the light it had a slashed circle on it with a nope, the lust in your 
heart thing was ok but EQ violated the little known 11th commandment, 
thou shalt not MMORPG

Inquisitions I fear more than any of your afterlife threats, those 
bastards were real, and really really scary.  Noone expects the spanish 
inqusition.

I'm confused, whats the difference between heretics and witches again? 
And since wicca is an officially recognized religion complete with 
chaplains in the US army, why are you attacking them but not, oh, say 
Zen Bhuddists or Santaria practitioners?  Or are those the heretics?  I 
thought heretics were people who believe 99% of the same things you do, 
only you differ slightly on some obscure point.

In which case I'm neither, I'm a hard core flaming atheist who disagrees 
with you on every point of your religion whatever it may be; Jesus was a 
nice guy, both wise and smart, but hardly a god, and the mockery that 
has been created in his name isn't deserving of my respect in any way. 
I don't, however, believe in Wicca either, so I guess I'm out on both 
counts.  Good news for my soul, if I believed I had one.  Since I don't, 
all soul based threats are falling on deaf ears.

On the other hand, with that inquisition crack, youu do realize you 
threatened me with physical harm because I was playing a game on a 
computer?  You, my man, are -not- with the peace love and understanding 
plan of your own lord.  Not even with the Eye for an Eye program (which 
by the way was an idea opposed by the people on the side of right...) 
THis is a slippery slope.  What if I decided I could only answer your 
threat of physical torture with the threat of atomic detonations?  Or 
reciting Vogon poetry?

> Everquest is the game of hell, programmed by SATAN !

Nah, SOE might be composed of lesser demons, but they didn't originate 
the game, and Brad himself can't really be the big guy, at best I might 
agree that he's Stan, lord of insufficient light.
