Brewing to 200 is easy! 

Minotaur Hero's Brew
WT: 0.4   Size: SMALL
Class: ALL
Race: ALL
 Components: cask, malt(3), short beer(2), water flask(2), yeast
In: brew barrel
Yield: 1
Trivial 248 

Easiset place is Thurgadin.  You can buy the Malt, Yeast & Water at
the merchant by the bank & then the casts & short beers are from the
merchant next to the brew barrel.  You'll need to make the first one
by experimenting.
