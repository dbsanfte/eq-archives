Thank you for mentioning this, as I was beginning to wonder if I was the 
only one who had noticed it. I had noticed that of the software I run, 
EverQuest 2 does tend to force me to restart the system after use, or 
after I use it a few times, as it seems to give my machine a fairly 
hefty memory hit.

That said, I doubt it's entirely EverQuest 2's fault. I believe my 
machine is suffering a few memory related errors, however EQ2 causes the 
worst of them.
