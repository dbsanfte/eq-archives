Well, I understand that the price will vary over time, so it is possible
that the price just changed without race being a factor.  It is, of course,
also possible that race does indeed have an impact.  Another consideration
is that amiable is a range of faction values, and one of your characters
could have been minimum amiable, and the other maximum amiable, and that may
figure into the pricing as well.
