Yeah, they are doing better than Funcom.  However, why can't they do
as well as Mythic?  If you add up all the downtime Mythic had since
release AND all the downtime during beta 4, it is less than Verant has
had this week.  I'd expect an expansion for an established game to
come closer to the Mythic example than the Funcom example.
