    I can't remember how many waves there are, but that sounds like a very
good first attempt for a guild not familiar with ring-style events. Remember
what I said about BP's bounding box when you actually spawn him - it's
deceptively tiny, so skeleton-form nukes are actually good in helping melees
determine if they're in range or not. Pets can help, too - Jabober will
automatically engage from max range, so you can follow the pet to where you
should be.

    There's a time delay before it goes again. If people are in the wrong
place when you recover from a wipe, you get spawned on - try and make any CR
you do fast and efficient.

    Best of luck to you in getting a shot at him. We were the first guild on
our server to drop AoW, and it took a fair number of tries. Even afterwards,
we had rough spots. I think it was three or so losses learning him, then we
went 3 wins 3 losses on the next six attempts. Now, unless we're trained by
onlookers, we win. Takes a long time to get down exactly how tank
transitions and healing/mana supply will work on a fight like that, because
a mistake kills so many people so fast (and you get maybe two tries at most
before the spawn is blown).

    A few days, until one guild or another gets some spare time to kill him.
He's at the bottom of the priority list, but he's at least on the list. And
he drops spells like Torpor and Sunstrike, spells that people kill for and
which we don't really see anywhere else (what with VP being bugged right
now).

    Because he's out of the way, people hate dying (and he's almost a
guaranteed death for someone), and the rewards (spells and a ST key) aren't
tangible and "sure" enough for some.

    Ayup, since the change to "sees invis" it's become a back burner target.
How far on the back burner? These days, when we're done raiding we do the
gnome quest in CT before thinking about ST or Sontalak. ;-) That gnome quest
rocks, BTW. The earring is a guaranteed upgrade for someone on the raid, the
XP doing it isn't so bad, it's relatively quick and not that hard, and while
you're in zone rangers can check tracking for any rares up in zone. Our last
time there we picked up the 10 WIS 100 MANA earring for a wizard, and also
got a 10/17 ranger axe off Toxiferous that will likely pad the peridot fund
nicely.
