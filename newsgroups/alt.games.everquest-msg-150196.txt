Back when I was in my 30's, my group needed a healer, so my guild leader
snagged her husband's gear (he was at sea at the time, so he didn't miss
it), ported over, and stuffed me with all the nice +Wis, and +Mana gear.
Granted, I still wasn't a cleric, but I was able to keep up pretty well.  Of
course, with gear like that, it's not suprising.

Looking at the Druid and Shaman heals in PoP, I think we're going to be
pushed back into insignificance.  I'm assuming that the encounters will be
scaled up to keep pace with the new spells.

Looks like it's time to go back th the bazaar.
