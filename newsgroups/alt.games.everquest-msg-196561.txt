Hahah, I was really trying hard to figure out what you could mean.

"I memmed the spell that lets you run faster than SOW but dies if you root...
and then root and run away."

OK, you didn't say that was the order of things, but it was the picture in my
mind.  I've almost never had a use for Scale, just today a shaman who had asked
me for a rez in Velks cast it on me, so I could get there faster and waste less
of my time.  Nice thinking, I suppose, but that meant that when I arrived, I
rezed him and gated out... with no SOW.  Not that its crucial with run 3, not
that I can't get one if I want one.. but its a little perk of the trade, getting
buffs like clarity or SOW from people who are about to be rezzed and so lose all
mana anyway.

I read a "how to" guide for shamans that suggested putting Cheetah in in place
of Gate as your escape spell.  I tested it out, it -does- work that way; quick
cast, overwrites SOW if you have one, and lights a bard speed fire under your
asterisk.  Having tested it out, I haven't bothered with it since, just as I
rarely have Gate memmed.  I rely on keeping SOW on me and memmed at all times
outdoors, and indoors, on root or flash of light and strafe running.

I didn't notice FM giants being particularly faster than my 26 shammy SOW, of
course I know how to strafe run and use a curvey course over terrain that
usually causes at least a little slowing on my pursuit due to pathing; at the
same time if I was running I'd either rooted the offending mob or was low enough
on health that I wasn't surprised at being caught.

No, thinking further, I pulled those giants out from inside the fort quite often
without snaring them and without them catching me any more than I'd expect; if
they were faster it was by very little, not enough to catch me if I had a spell
range running start.
