Howdy all, looks like GM events this weekend, below is a <system messge>
that came up at midday Aust time.

------------------------------------------------------------

[Thu Feb 14 14:33:51 2002] <SYSTEMWIDE MESSAGE>: Brenlo : Greetings
Norrath! Peril awaits you around every turn, familiar haunts are not
always safe and you never know where new Evil will appear! Today starts
a weekend of Adventure!  Let the fun begin!

------------------------------------------------------------

This was followed by the same zone wide message as in halloween event.

------------------------------------------------------------

[Thu Feb 14 14:35:54 2002] An uneasy feeling comes over you. The wind
starts to blow through the mountains with an eerie howl. You feel as
though you should leave this place, but your adventuresome spirit nags
you to stay.

------------------------------------------------------------

Then the zone repopped with Night Horrors etc, for about 5mins before
returning to normal mobs.

If it is the same as halloween event, Rathe mtns, WC, EK, NRo and
everfrost will all be involved So take care out there .   ;-)
