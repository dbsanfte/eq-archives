If you zone in from FoB you are on a big ledge above the main part of the
zone with all the trees; zoning in from Trak's teeth puts you down in the
jungle.
The Grand Staircase is a big stairway that is generally the only way up to
the ledge and the zone to FoB.

Best way to figure it out in person would be to create a newbie iksar, level
them to 3 or so (to avoid getting killed by the nasties in FoB) then run
them out to the back of the Kaesora ruins and over to the EJ zone line.
Once inside EJ, there doesn't seem to be that much stuff to kill you up on
the plateau, I made it about 3/4 of the way to the staircase with a 7 monk
before I got scared and turned back, only Mob I saw was a (very) red
mosquito.

Or just look at these maps:
