AS others said, he's by the wooden bridge to EK.  Walk to the bridge and
turn left to the wall.  He also dros a qeynos kite shield.  Kinda neat to
walk around with.  I give them to newbies outside qeynos.  His harm touch is
171 points.  I root and nuke.  He'll also make you kos to the corrupt
guards.
