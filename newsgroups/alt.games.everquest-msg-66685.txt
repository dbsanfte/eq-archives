And what have we learned today, boys and girls?
Don't call your characters '-nisse' :)

(Those Jon Blund segments should have been real stories instead,
though. East European 70's animation is kinda cool.)

Hehe. A friend had way more than 100 before dinging 50. He laughs
whenever I talk about reaching level 57. I'll show him. (Despite not
getting any exp whatsoever last night; we were trying to kill VS,
didn't have enough tankage, and when we tried again after KC had
crashed and a GM had stopped by and rezzed our casualties, we couldn't
stick a single nuke on him even in melee range. I don't know how 3rd
attempt went, or if there even was one)

Herr Nilsen had been across the pond and 'taken effect' of it, and was
somewhat of a jackass, while Pernille was just cute and all that and
tried to keep Mr. Nelson in line. That's all I remember beyond
thinking it was a weird Christmas show.

Heck, the very first thing I remember seeing on TV when we moved here
is 'Mot alle vindar', and now it's being rerun :)
