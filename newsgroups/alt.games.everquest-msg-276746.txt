I realised that this sub-question isn't covered in the FAQ (mainly
because I don't think it's F enough :-), so I'll add that I'm pretty
sure it doesn't matter how long the speech is, but traditionally the
folks who set up hotkeys for this do try to make the speech, um,
interesting.  Often the text is just explaining how the speech is
intended to improve your language skill.  One person I know chose to
use the five lines to recite a favorite limerick.  Me, I like to
think of the speech as teaching "commonly used phrases", where of
course the particular phrases depend on which of my characters is
doing the teaching.  Thus my Iksar uses things like,

	"This isn't food!  This is what food eats!"
and
	"How much is that baby in the window?"

while my Halfling prefers,

	"Is it time for second breakfast yet?"
and
	"Oo, nice smoke ring!"
