The conclusion. If you like these stories, let me
know.

Night in Nektulos, Part 3
Good Night
Gregory Gadow

The halfling barely suppressed a shudder as she
looked down on the corpse at her feet. "It's not
real", she repeated yet again. "It is a protective
shield around the goods my emergency teleport
spell couldn't carry. It is not my own dead body
laying there."

She knew this. The evac spell was the very first
thing she learned as a druid trainee.  It was
guaranteed no-fail but it teleported only the
basics and left everything else inside a force
field only you could penetrate. Problem was, this
field looked very much like YOU, and it always
gave Rosewhite the willies to do this.

Taking a deep breath, she said, "Well, best get
this over with."

She knelt down and reached for the things the
image hid.

"Earrings, left and right. Bracers, left and
right. Mask. Belt. Cap." She put her armor back on
as quickly as she could. "Skirt. Sleeves. Jerkin.
Shield."

It did not take long to retrieve everything, and
as she removed the last backpack, the protective
shield dissipated. This time she did shudder.
Worse than seeing her own dead face was watching
it turn to mist before your eyes.

As she stood up, she turned south, towards
Nektulos proper. Her normally soft green eyes
became hard malachite. In that direction, around
the corner, was the target of tonight's hunt.

>Some time latter<

"Bountiful rain, things finally going to plan!"

Rosewhite raised up her hands and drew fire from
the air. Guard G'Kel burst in to flame, his once
smooth skin now blistered and burned. With that,
he tried to excercise the better part of valor and
run. An earlier spell, though, made his steps
slow, as if running through heavy syrup.

"Not so fast, inkie", she muttered.

"Not."

*WHACK*

"So."

*WHACK*

"Fast."

*WHACK*

The guard fell under her staff, his last words a
curse and a promise of vengeance.

With a joy most unseemly for a servant of the Lord
of Hospitality, Rosewhite pulled the bronze
longsword from G'Kels hands and started rummaging
through his pockets. She found a few coins and
small stone covered in some runic script. Eh,
someone will buy it. She put the loot into her
bags and stood up. She knew that this was not
G'Kel's *real* corpse she was looting, any more
than it had been her own earlier. Still, there was
a bit of pleasure knowing he was out of the way
for a while and a much larger pleasure as she
anticipated getting to do this again. And again.

*DING!*

With a small whoosh of displaced air, a pixie
popped in to existence inches from her nose. It's
name tag proclaimed it to be a Messenger with the
Universal Messaging Service of Norrath, Druid
Division. Rosewhite held her breath. A personal
Messenger? That could only mean one thing....

"I'm lookin for a Ms... er, Rosewhite Blossom? You
her?"

"Yes I am. At least, that is what my mother named
me."

"Yeah, funny girl. I gotta message here from the
Home Office. Seemz like yoov been promoted, or
sometin. The text is, 'Welcome to 18th level.' I
dunno, maybe that means sometin to you."

"Oh, it does. Thank you."

"An I gotta give you deez."

The Messenger handed her a small paper bag.

"You know what to do wit deez practice chits,
right?"

"I do, yes, thank you."

The pixie pulled out a large clipboard and make a
check mark.

"Ok, I gotta schedule to keep so I'z scrammin.
Seeya latter, kid."

Before Rosewhite could say thank you, the pixie
vanished. She looked up and saw the early light of
morning struggling through the fetid mist of the
forsest.

"Splendid", she said to her self. "Six bronze
swords, a few research components, two packets of
oxide... Mr. Hammersmith will pay well, he's
always looking for dyes. And a promotion!"

Moving slowly -- six bronze swords are HEAVY --
she backed away from the guard post, pulled out
her Device and started memorizing the Gate spell.
Time to sell her loot and see Reebo in Rivervale.
And maybe a visit with her younger sister Petunia,
if the little rogue wasn't off somewhere stirring
up trouble. All in all, a night well spent.
