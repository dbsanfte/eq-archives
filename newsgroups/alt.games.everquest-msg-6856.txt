When you cast Eye of Zomm, the Eye appears right in front of you.  If
you are standing next to and facing a wall or door, the Eye sometimes
appears on the other side.  If it is a solid wall you are in front of,
the Eye can appear in very odd places.  E.g., in Blackburrow, an Eye
cast into a wall in the snake pit sometimes appears on the top level
near the tree with the trap in it.

I believe that in Kedge, there was a place to cast an Eye from near the
zone that would make the Eye appear near Phinny, and aggro him, and not
aggro anything else.  Phinny then goes to the zone all by himself, where
you have a relatively safe fight.
