*shrug*
You're correct, they mention the flag requirements change as "further
down the road" from tomorrow's patch.  Not that it'll matter to me
anytime soon.  I don't play Kaev anymore and my highest currently

"We want players to play with their friends and guild mates." is
given as the justification for the change.
