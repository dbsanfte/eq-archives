Mana song is only about a third of a bard's potential mana output, if his mana output is
really important.

Cantata, Amp, mana, mana, cantata, mana, mana, mana, mana, cantata, mana, mana, mana,
mana

will yeild much more total mana, plus a constant HP regen

This is, of course, a lot more work than:

Mana, turn it on, leave it on.

Further, if you really want just manasong, this is a singing based skill, which means
that there's no reason not to also put a weapon in each hand and pitch in on the melee;
yes, you're only doing 60% of what the other melee in your group are doing... but thats
still like having another half a person.

Thats not even touching on how many other far more useful contributions a bard can make
to most groups, if he is strong willed enough to ignore the ignorant demand for "nothing
but mana" which is all 90% of groups at that level are going to be aware a bard can do.
