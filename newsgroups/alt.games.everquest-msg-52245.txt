Aviak Rooks are still in the exp range for you, and very easy to solo at 26.
My warrior at lvl 29 thinks very hard about soloing an Avocet, but Rooks and
Harriers are dead meat and easy exp. The better exp is definitely outside
Paw though. At 26 you may even want to start going inside Paw and trying
there, need a good healer and preferably a chanter also.

Medding on the ramps at KFC is safe, but go above the first hut, otherwise
you may be eye level to passing Cyclops or Undead Cyclops. The only danger
is someone training those mobs up to you, happened once to my Mage, I was
afk when the cyclops killed me halfway to the penthouse. Watch out for the
werewolf also, that will be very red to you at 26, but the fun thing is
watching the Aviaks fight him on the rare occasion that he appears.
