I am the most excited about the Looking for Group feature.  I think it will
really enhance the game and make it a lot easier for players to spread out
and hunt in zones that previously have been "bring your own group" type.
Need faction?  Hook up with others that need faction instead of hunting
alone etc...

I also think Frogs will be fun.
