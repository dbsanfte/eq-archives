Ya know Biz, he sort of does have a point. These were very old posts. if 
he stopped top posting that long ago, you are blowing smoke from deep 
within your nether regions, as he obviously is a bottom poster, and not 
a top poster. One *could* assume that he learned to bottom post, and is 
no longer a top posting heretic.

And your willingness to keep harping on the subject, including spending 
the time searching his a.g.e postings for top posts is an awful time 
consuming endeavor, bordering on obsessive. Myself, I would rather go 
hunting in natimbi with my  favorite beastlord than sit at my computer 
googling for useless information. i happen to read the group for 
information, monual's stories [or other stories] and good stuff like 
that...in the last 3 weeks *i* had fun in germany playing eq with my 
favorite beast lord, and made him
