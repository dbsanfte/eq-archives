For class only... Beastlord or Shaman... for combos.. try Erudite Shadow
Knight or any of the "New" combos that came out after luclin.

Since you can still have one one character, these new combos are rare...
Same with Beastlord, there are fewer of them because you can't "try out" the
new class.

Yes, they said they were going to change that.

No, they decided not to.
