Consider this a valuable life lesson -- learning it in a game
costs a lot less than learning it in real life.

Three different times, I have helped out friends who had
fallen on hard times, and needed loans to help them through it.

One person got $9500, and only paid $1000 of it back.
One person got $3400, and didn't pay any of it back.
One person got $800, and only paid $200 of it back.

You'd be amazed how often so-called "friends" decide that
they'd rather keep the money and lose your friendship
than pay it back.

Never "lend" anything to someone expecting to get it back.
