Ooh.  Ah.  A lame class insult.  How droll.  Don't you
have some homework you should be doing?

Funny, it wasn't a problem the prior time I tanked Faydedar.
Or VSR with only 7 people total, none over level 57 at
the time.  Nor did it seem to be an issue when I helped
as a Paladin successfully tanked the new-and-improved
Innoruuk to the death after the Warrior dropped dead in
the first six seconds.
