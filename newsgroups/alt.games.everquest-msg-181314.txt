Hm, great answer as I wrote the lag went WORSE (as many other issues did
too) ... I never said it should run completely perfect as EQ will never do
.... and if their patches make their code even WORSE I think its their fault
?!?

Who has been an ass ? The "super-all-knowing-GM" that is there for support
and help and gave such an answer ? If they are too stupid to know solutions
for their BUGS (maybe you can read above why) then they should tell the
players ... and not in the wellknown arrogant way they do ... And their game
, their rules ? Hm, think you are not working as it should be clear that if
you cause problems by "patches/updates" in products you sell (yes, we pay)
you have to give support or at least you have to try to find a solution ...
And just to clear up : I just have described my problem and asked if it is a
known problem and if they have a solution for it (no usage of "harsh"
language ect....)... how would you respond to such an answer ? Maybe : "Oh
yes, Mr. GM-Sir ... but I never would leave this game because you are doing
such a great job ... please let me pay for it .... not important that I cant
play anymore in a reasonable way ... please let me stay with this game and I
wont try to get solutions for problems anymore" ? I dont really think so,
you would try to get answers to your questions too ....

I dont know on what server you play ... I never have seen harsh language on
my server (ok, I dont know how people use tells/groupchat) .... Just as a
few GMs have been on after their patches and the new Motd (and the BIG
problems like zoning-LD ect.), people that complained (not even using "that"
harsh language) went "surprisingly" LD ... I fully agree with you that the
game should be enjoyable for everyone ... but like I said I never had a
problem on my server before with that ...

Their forum ? Hm, according to the licence agreement its a server (!)
included in the game to help people getting support and to be able to
discuss gameissues (moderated by GMs) ... And if I answer a question with my
experiences .... why not ? ... it might help the player if I tell him how
long transfers from one server to the other took for me ... . Same goes for
people complaining about not getting response from support ... if I tell
them its useless as he never will get concrete answers to his question if he
has the same luck I had ... . I cant see how this is "disruptive" ... these
are just my experiences (that are btw caused by the support , not by me).
Think these answers are more useful for players that have questions as the
standardanswer by GMs : "your computer or your ISP causes all troubles..."
or the "pls call tech support" ....
