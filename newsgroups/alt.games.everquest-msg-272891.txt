So then what you meant was that there *were* places like that in the 
U.S. - the likes in which you've never lived, either.

What other reason is a person ever put in jail? People just aren't 
jailed without being reported by the authorities to have broken a law.

You've never seen it either. Even *if* it were to happen that police 
officers jail someone for no reason, a law is still reported to have 
been broken, true or otherwise.

No, right. You insist that someone should be incarcerated merely for 
doing something (something they have every legal right to do, btw) with 
which you do not agree. Seriously, that's a childish trait.
