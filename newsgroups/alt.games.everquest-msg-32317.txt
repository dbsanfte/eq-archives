I'd appreciate any suggestions on that respect. The Stein quest is great
for revenue (especially now that I don't even need to bother with Wolf
Form anymore... I'm amiable to everything in Oggok *as a human*), but
it's getting really old, really fast, and in Fennin sometimes it takes a
long time to find a buyer.

I've never whored my porting skills... I respond to requests, but I
never go around /shouting "TPing for plat!". The problem with that is
that every time I respond to a request I have to explain that, unless
for CR, I'd appreciate some money for my time.

Anyway, all tips on making fast platinum for a Druid will be more than
welcome...

/em sighs and thinks of Golden Efreeti Boots...
