Yes, I think it was something of a bug which became a feature
eventually. Its something to do with you no longer being an iksar,
being the base faction start off point due to wolf form, plus
having cazic as a god = your faction. The same is true for my dark
elf cleric. Wolf form does not get her to perfect but it eliminates 
the "dark elf" faction hit, starts her at a neutral point, plops
"innoruk" on top of that. This is why there is no way for her to raise
cleric faction in rivervale, with wolf form OR halfling form (one use
halvling form mask) The innoruk diety part makes them threaten anyway.

Dark elf doesn't start anywhere near as low as iksar, especially if
agnostic.

This also works for good characters. My wood elf druid was bored when
she discovered she was dubious to dismal rage, instead of threaten or
something, in wolf form. Quite a few bone chips later I am now allied
to dismal rage in freep sewer east, while in wood elf form. I'm up to
nearly non kos to opal darkbriar evil even, when out of wolf form.

Unrest is even more that way, in unrest wolf form REALLY makes you
neutral. The undead totally ignore you. Its nice in the new jaggedpine
zone also, makes the griffons indiff which helps a druid to lazily
kill them with no danger (until some fool trains some potatoheads)
