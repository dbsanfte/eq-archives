Hi,

I have a lvl 60 Pally who tends to solo a lot or 2 box with a Druid. Very
rarely groups cos I am in the UK and play on a US server and so play when
there are not many other people online. My question is - should I sacrifice
some AC for items that have Attack value modifiers? By my reckoning I would
loose about 30 AC but gain about +45 to attack with the items I am looking
at.
