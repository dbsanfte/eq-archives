I have no idea, and having asked some officers, neither do they. I
always assumed it would somehow agro IV or something. So you've been
killing them with no problems? Too funny. I guess whoever got the first
info on the encounter in our guild had someone pull his leg on this
then. We don't really do IV anymore but I guess if we ever do we'll have
to try killing the youngs this time.
