	The worn jug contains one of the quest pieces for the
charm of lore quest.  It's guarded by one of three goblin chieftains.
They should be pretty easy.  They don't even summon.  But they DO
cast a kind of death touch "precision strike" which goes like this:

	You have been pierced by a thrown dagger!
	Chieftain Whomever hits you for 8000 points of non melee damage!
	Loading please wait.

	Does anyone have a hint on how we might get this guy to
move long enough to loot the quest piece?
