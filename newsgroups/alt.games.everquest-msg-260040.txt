I agree, the game shouldn't be all cookies. I enjoy that I have to work 
to progress as a character and that death (in most games) carries a 
penalty. I wouldn't want an RPG where I started out high level just 
because getting there takes effort. I'm just saying that sitting there 
watching my toon take 10 minutes to trudge across a landscape is the 
kind of thing that I would want abstracted down. Likewise, if I have a 
map, I'm going to mark things on the map so I know where they are.

Exploring is only fun to me if there's something to explore. If I'm 
surrounded by gnolls in this valley and I go explore the next valley 
only to see it also populated by gnolls, I don't really feel like I 
discovered anything. Memorizing the geometry of the geography isn't 
something that gives me a thrill, unless there are new and exciting 
things to find as I do so. The only things to "find" in most of these 
kinds of games are new spawn points, which is certainly cool, but it's 
hardly terra nova -- all I have to do is follow the other players.  ;)

For me, an RPG (MMO or otherwise) has always been first about my 
character. This means I do things that allow me to enhance my character 
and will avoid things that have no positive result on him. In most 
games, "enhancing" is limited to an XP grind, which I find 
disappointing. I like CoH's gameplay but I don't like that the only 
thing you can do to "better yourself" is combat. I did a task force 
mission and was very disappointed that I didn't get any kind of badge or 
trinket that said I'd done it. I don't care if the trinket is 
irrelevant, stat-wise, I just want the acknowledgement that I did it.

The new CoH update will have a badge system that satisfies it for me. 
I'll have a lot of fun with that, even if badges have no effect 
whatsoever on leveling.

I would enthusiastically play a game that allowed me to constantly hone 
my character's abilities, reputation, appearance, and anything else that 
makes him *him* by exploring. If I explore every part of the map and get 
a "Great Explorer" title or award, I'd do it, even at the expense of XP.

It sounds like the pure "worldy" MMORPG is something born of a tabletop 
game, and would be very difficult to actually implement online, at least 
for now. I agree, though, that "worldy" elements would be appreciated.
