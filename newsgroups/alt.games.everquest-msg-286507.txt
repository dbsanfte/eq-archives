Click 'Forums' on the EQPlayers main page you love so much.

I've told you about the forums before, and how they helped keep people
informed during patches.  You refused to read them because you don't like
them.  Fine, as I said at the time, your choice, but don't complain that
Sony doesn't update us, it does, just not in the place you're looking.

People who care about the game post the updates on the forums, people who
get paid peanuts to boot servers and update status pages don't bother.
