We had the problem a ways back when we first started clearing Hate.

Hint: If your raid channel is /join dansraiders, have a seperate one set
up for /join dansleaders and only invite your chanters, officers,
clerics and actual raid leader into it. Next time they set you up for a
wipe, just call the "CLERICS CAMP OUT" command in the leader channel.
Then wait five minutes, come back and say, 
/1 Hrmmm.. Everyone seems to be dead. I suppose we should rez them. Are
you all ready to listen to the MA *now*, by chance?
