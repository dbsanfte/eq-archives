I'm curious about what weapons/items in the game are "duds" at the
level you get them but turn out useful later?

Case in point: The Packmaster's Lash out of the Warrens. 

My bard has spent half his carreer, on and off, in the Warrens. In his
teens, I started "making the rounds" of the named kobolds whenever I
was in the area. The Packmaster dropped his lash a couple of times.
When he had it, the fight was always close because that choking effect
made my HP drop like a rock. I couldn't make it proc, though, and the
damage was mediocre so I stuck it in the bank and forgot about it. I'd
have just sold it but I had this idea of collecting every whip in the
game.

Fast forward, to level 22 in Stonebrunt. My off-hand coldain velium
scimitar wasn't really cutting the mustard any more. While passing
through the Warrens and checking on the Packmaster (I still wanted his
boots) I remembered what a pain that choking effect had been. Swapped
the scimitar for the lash and in my next battle I got a ring of fire
around the kobold followed by a very satisfying drop in its life bar
over the next couple of ticks.

Since then, I have had more than one multi-pull situation where the
choking proc has been the difference between living and dying. I was
completely unimpressed with it when I first got it. Now it's my
favorite off-hand weapon.

So, after the long-winded anecdote, I'm curious about other such items
in the game. What sort of things have players found that they nearly
chucked as useless when they got it but found to be nice items at a
later level in life?
