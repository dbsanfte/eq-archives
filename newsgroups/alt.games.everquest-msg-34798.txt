 Perhaps. But it becomes a little harder when you only have 30 minutes
to do it (Or whatever the time is). Fighting a mob and your ISP dies and
you go LD. Mob kills you while LD. Can't get back on. Corpse poofs.
Unless you mean RL connections. The person could try calling a friend
and giving them their info to log on, but you can't always count on
being able to reach someone.

 Basically it's a dumb idea to twink before level six. Sure, the chances
of losing your things are low, but there's really not much benefit other
than +HP items to twinking that low.
