HOLY CRAP! I didn't know it was a 30 spell! Ok, silly question
time: Does it stack with the GB proc? Imagine this thing on a
GB, a paladin could trivially mow through spectres... Well, Ok,
not trivially, but... And then there's the uber pally swords,
Dawn something comes to mind, which has a hefty proc of its
own. Dawncaller, maybe?

Another question arises: Did SKs get a similar spell?

Rune
The real ubers will now belittle me for calling the Dawn
whatever sword 'uber'.
