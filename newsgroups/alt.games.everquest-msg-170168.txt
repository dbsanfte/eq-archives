It's an incredibly fun and exciting class to play. I find it the
perfect blend of in-your-face melee and casting. You don't need to
twink to be effective solo. I took my BL on FV to 44 in mostly
patchwork. I didn't start to upgrade my gear until 39 when I could
finally solo Hill Giants. The most effective Item you can give a BL
starting out is a Polished Steel Ulak (9/27 h2h with stats). On most
servers you can buy them for 10-20pp in the bazaar.

Pros:
1. Sustained DPS (damage per second)
When everything is flowing right you can keep your Warder, Health, and
Mana at 50% and fight almost non-stop with a constant supply of single
dark blue pulls. Compared to classes that have to sit and med between
pulls (Mages, Druids, Wizards, etc) BLs are amazing soloers under the
right conditions.

2. Spell cost. 
BL spells are amazingly cheap compared to all other classes. Only the
high level drop spells are expensive.

3. Race Selection
You really can't go wrong with race selection. The old saying "play
what you like" applies here. Overall I would personally rate the Ogre
as the best, because they cannot be stunned from the front. I am
amazed by how often I get stunned with the other races after playing
an Ogre. 

Race Breakdown....
Ogre = 15% exp penalty, Infravision, Cannot be stunned from the front,
Slam

Troll = 20% exp penalty, Infravision, Regen, Slam

Iksar = 20% exp penalty, Infravision, Regen, Forage, AC bonus
(@42points at level 60)

VahShir = Infravision, Sneak, Safe Fall

Barbarian = 5% exp penalty, Slam, NightBlind

Here are the only downsides I have found with the class...

1. No crowd control. 
If you get jumped by too many adds things can get ugly fast. Your
warder can usually tank 2 dark blues at once (dark blue to the warder)
if you have the mana to heal the warder. Any more adds than that and
you will usually have to bail. Basically if you solo a lot, you will
find yourself mostly outdoors. 

2. Level gap between Warders.
You get your first Warder at 9, then 15 (6 levels), 22 (7 levels), 30
(8 levels), 39 (9 levels), 49 (10 levels). Now compare this to the
other pet classes. Mages and Necros have "in-between" pet upgrades. 4,
8, 12, 16, 20, *24, 30 , *34, 39, *44, 49.....It should be no surprise
that the toughest levels for a BL are 35-39 and 44-49. In both cases
your Warder will be light blue or green to you for the last 2-3 levels
before your next upgrade. The level gap means that soloing BLs will
experience "hell levels" in their late 30s and 40s.

3. Finding groups
Most EQ players know very little about the BL class. Many think they
are watered down monks or shaman. This can make it hard to find
groups. Most players like to stay in thier "comfort zones" and only
look for the classes they are familiar with when grouping. This
situation is getting better as more people learn about the class.

I highly recommend the class. You can get a lot more info at the
