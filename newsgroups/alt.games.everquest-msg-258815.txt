I have recently quit playing Everquest in frustration caused by poor
connection.  I have played EQ for about 4 months on my dialup and
things were mostly good for that time.  About a mont ago I decided to
purchase LDONs and that is when my problems have started.  Since I
purchased the upgrade I kept going LD and could not hold a group.

Has it been noticed before that LDONs create additional network
traffic preventing it from being dialup friendly?
