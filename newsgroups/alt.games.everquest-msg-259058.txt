I still find the manuals in PC games worth reading, but then I still
find the manuals in my console games that come in DVD style cases worth
reading.  I find they contain useful information on how to play the game.
I'd much rather have bigger, more complete, manuals as well as proper
CD cases, but PC games manuals of today that I've read aren't a waste of
paper.  You still the see the occasional jewel case, but it's unfortunate
that more and more games are using cheap cardboard or paper sleeves.
Hmm... how do DVD-style case designs handle three or more CD-ROMs?

I'd rather have a box big enough for a complete manual and a single CD
jewel case big enough to hold all the game's CD-ROMs.  If a DVD case
happens to big enough, then that's fine, but if takes a big giant old
style box to get everything to fit inside, that's what I want.

I wonder if you'ld feel that way about games like Baldur's Gate, if
you weren't already intimately familiar with the AD&D rules.  Myself,
even knowing the AD&D rules, I still found myself using the Baldur's
Gate manual as a reference when playing the game.
