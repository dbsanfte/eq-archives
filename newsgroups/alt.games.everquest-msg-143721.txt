Quiet you, there's too many rangers there already.

What I don't get is why L50-55 DRUIDS are there. The eye? It drops way
too rarely to be worth camping, might as well just buy it (3 in over
500 griffons for me). There aren't nearly enough griffons/wisps to
quad - every druid I've seen there is root/dotting. Experience
quadding is FAR better. There are too many gnoll casters to get a
reliabe quad bunch very often (and the warriors have 4500hp, thats a
lot of casts pre-FoK), the potameids can't be snared.

The druids are fooling themselves if they think its a good experience
zone for them. As a ranger I kill two or three for every one a druid
gets.

IMO. :-p
