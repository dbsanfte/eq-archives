To an extent you're right.  That extent might not be all that large, though. 
Drugs are readily available to the people that want them (at least around
here).

Alcohol and cigarettes would suggest otherwise.  Both are taxed so much that
you pay more to the government than you do to the manufacturer.  Yes, there
is some "underground" in both markets, but it's not a big thing.

The ethical dilemma, to me, is that government is enforcing morals.  There
are suitable laws in place for the people that might do drugs and then, for
instance, go out and drive, that are not an enforcement of morals.  That guy
sitting at home watching Friends reruns and getting stoned isn't breaking
any law that I support.
