Then it's probably time to stop being antisocial and delete your
necro/druid.  Or keep them and start playing the game as it was intended to
be played.

As for mana regen, nothing has been changed in that regard (the med bonus
someone else mentioned is so minor as to be ignorable).  The only positive
item is that if you DO become social there's a decent chance you'll get a
mana regen buff cast on you, and/or a bard in your group to help.
Enchanters get their first mana regen spell at 16 and bards get their first
mana song at 20.
