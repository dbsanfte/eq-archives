Someone would give 5K for that?  I dunno where it drops or whatever,
and know even less about tank armour,  but if I was selling I'd ask
250 plats.  And be happy if I got it.  

Why would someone pay 5-15k for this?  Am I missing something or is it
basically just a twink item? Ac20 + 25hp = crap

Of course I only play casters, so nevermind haha
