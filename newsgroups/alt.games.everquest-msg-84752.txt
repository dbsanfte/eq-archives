Yep...makes you feel bad when the rangers are better at CR than
yourself :-).  From what I understood from a paly friend the other day,
a Mage (MAGE!) single pulled Phinny without bringing any of
his guardians.

I'd LOVE to know the technique with that...'long as it's not an exploit.
Because I remember the old exploit (which we never did, for the
simple reason that if we were going to get Phinny, we'd spend a few
hours in Tainted room for the guild druids, too), and that was pretty
cheesy.  But Vaalk said they got him to the Tainted room, and a 60
mage solo pulled him through a full spawn.

Anybody have any ideas on how he did this? I doubt it's "class-
specific" to the pull, but probably a trick or something.
