And?  That means rogues deserve the ridicule?  Whatever.

The quest isn't a joke.  It's easier than many of the other quests.  That 
doesn't mean it's a joke.

Phinny is a bigger pussy cat than Renux, so I don't know how you set up 
your argument like you have.

The thing about the rogue epic fights, they only benefit the rogue.  Both 
air and Chardok royals benefit at LEAST 3 classes epics.

No, I'm saying that even though it's a harder time to get up to Spiroc 
Lord, those rogues and monks and druids you bitch about having an easier 
time getting their epics were fighting the way all the way up there with 
you, and in the end, doing as much work FOR you as you are doing for 
yourself.

Thanks Perception 101.

Yes, and once, 2 on a single clearing.  Every level 50+ warrior in my 
guild has the freaking Golem Ball.  Oh wait, I take that back, I think 
one guy doesn't, because he's never been able to make it to fear because 
he keeps an odd schedule.

That's nice.  We had one slime blood in about as many Golem kills, soul 
leach maybe 2 or 3.

You're so sweet.  /hug /pinch cheeks
