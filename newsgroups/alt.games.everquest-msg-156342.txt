I can melee solo shrooms and velks spiders.  No down time, either,
as it takes long enough per kill that my minor mana expenditures are
made back up, and I can BP CHeal myself about every other mob.

If a cleric can melee solo something, then certainly a monk should
be able to do so, with their lower AC compensated for by better
avoidance and much better damage output.

If a monk can't solo either of these mobs at 60, then they desperately
overnerfed the class.  I'm a big proponent of monks getting adjusted
down a bit, but thats waaaaay too much.
