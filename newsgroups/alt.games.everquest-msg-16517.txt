Yes, but you aren't doing trade skills all the time.  I have an INT set in
the bank for that.

You might try to replace some of the platinum jewelry (necklace and rings)
with velium.  That will get you 3 more int.

Looking at my list, I have a few things that you might want to keep an eye
out for.  Golden Efreeti Boots.  Loam sleeves and legs.  Runed Cowl.

All this stuff raises INT, which isn't quite what you were looking for.  But
every point you raise INT in one slot means that much more INT that you can
swap out in other slots for stuff that gives AC or resists.
