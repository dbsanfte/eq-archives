The chanter with Tash.  Then the shaman debuffs when it's in range ( 
probably getting aggro ), then the chanter roots and the shaman works on 
slowing it ( mage pet sent in after the first attempt at slow hits ).  
After it's slowed and rooted, the warrior and rogue engage.

But, that takes more coordination than I the chanter could have probably 
handled.

I can't imagine that group not having the mobs rooted so the Warrior can 
keep aggro from the Rogue or Mage that is probably nuking her KEI'd heart 
out.
