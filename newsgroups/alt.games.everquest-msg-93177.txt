I was about to argue with this and say that it was sexist, then I
realized that it is pretty much true.. ahaahahha. 

I don't actually have a female guild leader in my guild, but everyone
in it who has been a "drama queen" and got very upset with what was
being said by people or left the guild over a single insult was in
fact a female.

Not all females are like this of course who play, but when one is they
would certainly make a bad officer or leader.
