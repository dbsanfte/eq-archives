I am running eq on an obsolete paper weight and i've finnally gotten to the
point I am ready to toss my computer out the window out of frustration
(mostly in kunark). After a year of " /group I'm gonna lag my way through
the zone I'll meet you on the other side" I've decided enough's enough, I
shouldn't have to fear entering a zone with tree's. (sitting in the desert's
in lvl 40's gets very dull). I drove a few guild mate's nuts last night
bugging them to help me sort out my choppiness in the game and after
fiddling with every setting in-game we decided my computer had to go (p2
333mhx 64 ram 8mb vid card all integrated and obsolete paper weight
materials) I'm not going to worry about my mhz just yet since I have to do
this in bits and pieces to be able to afford it. I figure the first things I
should worry about are more ram (probably another 64mb's) and a video card.
The ram is easy to get the video card on the other hand is where I am lost.
I have to spend under $150 canadian and still manage to get a half decent
card. I've been shopping around all morning while the servers have been down
and it pretty much boils down to 2 different cards for me and now I need
advice from people who have used them and can verify they work well with eq.
the first card I am leaning more towards is the Ati rage fury pro, it's only
32mb but that is a huge upgrade compared to my 8mb card now, the second is a
voodoo 5 64mb...only thing is with them having gone out of business I'm not
sure what I'll get for upgraded drivers or support and how soon I'll need to
replace it again. They are both selling for around the same price here and
the 64mb is tempting but I want to be able to phone them for support or
upgrade my drivers as time goes by and I don't think they will offer that
for much longer now. I'd love to be able to go ahead and buy a better card
than both of these but it's not affordable for me so these are pretty much
my choices (except for several cards from companies I had never heard of).
So I am begging and pleading for advice from anyone here that runs eq on
either of these cards. I've been following the voodoo5 thread above but it
isn't helping me much =)
