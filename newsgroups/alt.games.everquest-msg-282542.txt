Uh, then you can't gate back to your original bind point. Same problem.

Does druid track cover the whole zone? Even half of it?

I would agree on that point.

That's a pretty narrow (and I might even say selfish) view.

Let's keep in mind the original point to this thread is the fact that a 
person would go looking to impose on others to avoid running a zone or 
two away. That's the real issue here, not whether druids should mind
