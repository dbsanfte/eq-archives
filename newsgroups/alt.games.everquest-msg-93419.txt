I am the original poster and wish to state that my first posting was 
based on erroneous information:  I was led to understand that druids 
offensive cap was 200 while clerics had 175.  That is totally incorrect.

Now that I have gone to casters realm I see that when comparing 
clerics/druids/shamans that their defensive/offensive caps are the same 
at 200 each.  The weapon caps are 175 for both druid and cleric while 
shaman weapon caps are 200 -- not much difference.

So I retract any misleading statements I might of made.  Sorry.

And yes, clerics do need to every now and then break away from a group 
and do so solo melee for their own sanity.
