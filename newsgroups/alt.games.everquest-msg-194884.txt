Harvester, but its not a weapon. It goes in the secondary slot and gives +5
to Int and Deadeye as long as its held. (Deadeye = Infravision and See
Invisible combined) I think it has a Str bonus, too.

Quest can be found at Temple of Sol Ro, but you need to be at least lvl 25
to do it (and will probably need help for the Shadowed Men part). Check the
Bazaar to see if any are for sale.

Other than the epic (which isn't really a scythe - its 1hb), I don't know of
any scythe-like weapons that Necros can use.
