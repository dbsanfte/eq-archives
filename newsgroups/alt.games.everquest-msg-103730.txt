Actually, at level 24, the INT points over 200 would be worth more than the
ones up to 200.  For every 5 INT at level 24, you get 24 mana.  For every 5
INT over 200, at any level, you get 29 mana.  At level 30 is where the INT
over 200 is not as good as the INT up to 200.  This is all assuming that the
formula here is indeed correct.  Based on this, he should be going for more
INT items over 200, not worrying about getting to 200.
