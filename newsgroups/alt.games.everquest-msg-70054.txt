Hell, my Pally uses root to help pull the mob off the caster if he gets
aggroed (or, in any event, to allow him to walk away while the mob is
rooted).

Order of the Mallet

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
