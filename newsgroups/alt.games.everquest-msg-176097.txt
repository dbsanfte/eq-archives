Seconded. I solo my Necro extensively, and have not swung a weapon in
any seriousness since level 5. Seriously.
My weapon skills are all 0, except 1hP which is 14. On a 27 Gnecro.
It just don't pay as a necro to step up to ANYTHING. Hell, most of what
I kill is nearly out of sight for the majority of the battle. Plenty of
time to FD or gate, depending on level, when it turns toward me.
