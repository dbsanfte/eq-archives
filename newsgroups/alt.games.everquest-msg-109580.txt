Aww poo behbee your little lie gets caught out, time to move onto the
next one?

Considering your feeble "points" are nothing but lies and babble, if I
have a two pint head, yours is treading into negative territory.
Humiliation time agian.

More like you changed when you saw your pitiful lie go down the drain.

But, we will indulge the dumbass one more time. Here's the dictionary
definition since you've apparently never seen the word before this
thread.

role-play (rlpl)
v. role-�played, role-�play�ing, role-�plays
v. intr.

To assume or act out a particular role:


Wow! Act out? You mean... roleplaying can be defined as acting? What a
fucking shock!

Every instance of "roleplaying" in my posts:

>>Roleplaying is acting.

I was going to say even you aren't dumb enough to misunderstand that
one.. but that would be against all evidence in this thread.
Roleplaying is defined by me here as playing anything other than
yourself, in a role. What a revelation that must be for you!

>>Roleplaying isn't just your "thee and thou" rp nazi. Any time you're
>>taking the role of your character you're roleplaying. 
>>Basically everyone is roleplaying in some fashion except the worst of
>>the dewds, and an argument could even be made for them.

Nothing changed. Uh oh, did little Taras get caught in a fib again?

Koster is next, if you have the IQ to figure out how to look at old
posts you can see his definition of roleplaying. Where he, to your
disappointment, gives the exact thing I was saying before -
roleplaying can be broadly defined.

Could it be because Koster listed four different definitions of
roleplaying you think (using the term VERY loosely in your case) that
only one is true.

Here's a hint, sunshine. They are all true. All of them are
roleplaying. You may choose to tie yourself to only the narrowest
definition, but that just defines you as narrowminded, not the word
roleplay.

Back to me now. The last one before you pissed your pants and tried to
weasel out of the humiliating corner you had backed into by switching
to lies, fallacies, and ad hominem attacks.

>>I said that was a
>>reasonable definition of roleplaying, and the one that I was going
>>from when I initially responded.

"that" was the "roleplaying is acting" quote.

That's it! Not a single definition of roleplaying changing.

Poor little Taras lied again!

Maybe you didn't lie on purpose. Maybe you're just an idiot of
astronomical proportions. I'll let you decide which, if you have the
balls to even face up to your mistake. Somehow I doubt it.


>I suspect your definition of acting will become as
>nebulous as your definition of roleplaying, as
>soon as it becomes inconvenient to you.

Which is it, my little liar Taras? Am I changing my definition of
acting (already disproven) or of roleplaying (now disproven)?

I can't wait to see which lie comes next!

>
>You can't even be bothered to go back one post and

>about.

You don't appear to be able to hold your attention on anything that
long. A sign of mental immaturity. When you're older, ask me again,
I'll explain it to you.

>
>You are a clod of inordinate proportions.

This clod repeatedly shows your lies and mistakes for what they are,
dumbass.

I wonder what word he will desperately claim I am changing the
definition of next... "dumbass" maybe? Or how about "ignorant
fuckwit"? Both must be words he sees a lot of....

Only one thing is certain - he will steadfastly refuse to answer
anything, instead resorting to feeble easily disproven fallacies and
ad hominem attacks. When you're ready to try debating instead of being
an asshole (and yes, you were the one being an asshole in this thread
first), I'm sure I'll still be here, posting from google maybe,
because I'm moving later today, but I will be here.

While I have dictionary.com open:

Taras Bulba
n.

   1. A foolish or stupid person.
   2. A person of profound mental retardation having a mental age
below three years and generally being unable to learn connected speech
or guard against common dangers.
