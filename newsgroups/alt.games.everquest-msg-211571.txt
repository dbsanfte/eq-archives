Hmmm, let's see...

1) the post of mine you attempted to "twist" directly contradicted
you, no "twisting" there,
2) the overwhelming majority of what I see posted in response to your,
er, position here either directly contradicts one or more of your
assertions or points you to legitimate sources that do so, no "most
are twisting" there,
3) the majority of the responses I see look more well considered than
your original post, no "most ... without thought" there.

Looks like you're oh for three there casey, no joy in mudville tonight.
