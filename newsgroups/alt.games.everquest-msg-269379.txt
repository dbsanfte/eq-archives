While 'bot is short for robot, it has nothing to do with 'scripted'.

In EQ1 the typical bot is set on autofollow, and has a couple hotkeyed 
actions setup like: target the MA and heal when I push '2'.

Language evolves. If people use a word to mean a certain thing, and 
others correctly interpret what the intended meaning is then the word 
now means that certain thing. Get off your high horse about 'incorrect 
usage'.

And the word robot pre-exists even electricity, and certainly doesn't 
have anything to do with scripted video game characters... "except for 
'newbies like you who mutated it... " right?  You can't argue that a 
word doesn't mean something by invoking a historical definition that has 
itself only been extremely recently attached to the definition you'd 
like to use.

Now your splitting hairs. Pushing Alt-1 to heal me on demand is a buff 
on command scenario in my books. Requiring the use of 3rd party software 
is asinine. Everquest has enough built in functionality (like hotkeys, 
short macros, and auto follow) to render 3rd party software unnecessary 
to 'botting effectively.

Well that's rather moot. That nobody has *ever* referred to someone 
running a warrior and a rogue as running a 'buffbot' seems to have 
escaped you.

If the cleric is not being actively played, just stands there, does 
nothing but cast heal on demand, and buffs every other hour or so, then 
its a bot. Its not a sophisticated bot like what you can accomplish with 
Xylobot in AC... but so effing what? A simple bot is still a bot.

Thrash all you want about definitions, the prehistory of mechanical 
beings, and what people do in other titles. Most eq players diffentiate 
between 'two boxxing' and having a 'bot' available. The former implies a 
level of interactive play on the 2nd character that we wouldn't usually 
associate with a bot. But its a grey line... there is no fixed point at 
which the 2nd character stops being a bot, and players will draw the 
line each to their own tastes, for some the 'bot is whichever character 
they view as 'secondary'.

If that shatters your world view of what 'bot means, get over it.
