I think it's pretty clear that Verant hopes to make that area a population
center.  Even if it's a bit of a pain to get to, once people get there there
is *plenty* to do.  Like Lake of Ill Omen/Firiona Vie/Frontier Mountains/The
Overthere/Dreadlands, they're a huge pain in the ass to get there (for non
porters), but once you do you don't need to leave for 40 levels.

I think they're aiming for the same thing in Odus.  When Kunark first came
out, those zones I list above were relatively under populated (especially
compared to now).  Now they're extremely busy.  Of course, they're also well
designed zones... not having been to The Warrens or Stonebrunt yet I can't
comment on whether they compete.  But it definitely seems to be Verant's goal.
I hope they succeed, another populous area would be good.
