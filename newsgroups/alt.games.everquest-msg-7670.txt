The newbie area is definitely under-utilized in LOIO. I went there to get a 
sabertooth cat canine, and that's about it until level 22 or so.

But, the mid-20's areas are WAY camped. I did okay at the goblin mines for a 
while, until it started being the popular PL area. I did level 30 at the 
lake 
due east of the FM zone. I had to buy SoW potions in order to be able to get 
mobs. I'd sometimes be competing with 3 other groups there.

And, then there were the two level 39 bards kiting multiple bloodgills. That 
was the icing on the cake for me. While I had never even seen a bloodgill up 
until that point, these 2 idiots were kiting *in* the same area where high 
20's were fighting. Literally running in circles around me. Sometimes 
picking 
up a skeleton which would later get trained on someone. When I asked the 
first 
to stop, he ignored me. When someone shouted about getting trained by a 
bloodgill, the 2nd basically said "tough." The first two people to go on my 
"no favors, no ports, no rezzes for life list." :-)

Anyhow.. I wasn't the one saying that there WAS more exp in LOIO, I was the 
skeptic. I made another post with my findings. :-)
