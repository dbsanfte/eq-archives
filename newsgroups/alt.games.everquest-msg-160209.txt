VNC takes control of your desktop. If you were running EQ normally,
the desktop is surpressed. In other words to get to the desktop from
within EQ you have to "crash" the game in order to return focus to the
desktop. My guess is that when VNC fired up it dumped EQ when the
focus was changed to the desktop for remote control.

Have you tried running EQ in a window via EQW?
