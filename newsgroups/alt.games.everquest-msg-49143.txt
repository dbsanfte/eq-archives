The idiot factor ruined playing Diablo online for me.  There was no "ignore
them" - running a "traditional" party was next to impossible.  Cheat, kill
us all, type U SUK!!!!! :) :) :) lather rinse repeat.

*everything* I read about UO pointed down the same road, with the exception
of the hacking issue - and please, don't offer "well, if you're good enough,
you can outplay the PKers".  Yeah, "let's wait by the spawn point, kill
them, lather rinse repeat!".  Heh, kinda wrecks the whole idea of being in
this immersive online world <shrug> so I avoided UO, and Origin's ignorance
of the fact that people don't *enjoy* that.

Except, of course, from the sidelines and when it's lord british ;-)
