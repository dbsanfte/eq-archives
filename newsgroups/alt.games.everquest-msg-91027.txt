As this is the only post with GMT (sorry, I'm a Brit who can't be arsed 
working out what PST is to GMT), I'd reply to this one. If the server is 
having an emergency patch at 23:15, which is, er...now..., why couldn't 
I even log on for the last hour. I'd assumed it was already was ready in 
the post-patch-patch stage then.

And why does it get to double the ETA of the original patch before they 
call it an emergency?

And why can't they send a eqnews.txt out so that you know the servers 
are tits up before having to sit through the Verant and Station logos, 
and then the hassle of trying to log in?

Bugger this, I'm off to play DAoC.
