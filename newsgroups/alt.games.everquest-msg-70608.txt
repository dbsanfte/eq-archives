Geesh...you asked him why *he* went with Giant faction.  He's uber, so
of course he gives reasons relevent to someone in an uberguild.  If
you wanted to know about the faction choices for a non-uberguild, you
should have *asked* that question.

Are you OK?  There's been a change in your posting style over the last
couple of weeks.  You used to come across as a quite reasonable person
(except for being a total crackpot when it comes to wizards :-)).
Lately, you've been rather testy, and at times even a jerk.  There's
nothing wrong with being a jerk (hell...I'm often a jerk here), but
you seemed nice for so long, it is rather unexpected. :-)
