 I play a Paladin and although I have been given many SoWs, I have never
asked for any. I figure if I need a certain spell I would pick the class
that offers it, i.e. I love the Paladins emergency heal since I like to solo
and so chose that class. I do get the occasional "HEAL ME!" but make it a
point not to assist people who don't have basic manners and hope they'll
learn something about real life as well. One time I cast my emergency heal
on an idiot who immediately picked another fight he couldn't handle and then
ran back to me demanding to be healed with the mob actively beating on him,
well he ended up dead and I managed to escape. Then I got to hear some of
his obnoxious tells which seemed to assume I should only be playing EQ to
help him.  One emote/animation I would like to see is /you kicked
idiot<player> in the ass.
