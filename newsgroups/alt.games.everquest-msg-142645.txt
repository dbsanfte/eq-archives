At the risk of starting a class war (not my intent, really),
how is this any different from introducing "triggered" copies
of, say, Faydedar for the Druid epic because the Druids bitched
long enough and loud enough?

Faydedar showing up once a week not good enough?  Okay, let's
just make it so you can trigger a copy of him (and an easier
copy, at that) as a result of a trivial subpart of the quest.
Ditto for the magical introduction of Venril Sathir's Remains,
who is easier than Venril Sathir, and who shows up seven
times as often, and just happens to drop the required Druid
item...

And no, I'm not complaining -- if I had my way, I'd twiddle
a few other epic quests in the same way, including the Paladin
epic (dragon book portion) and the Cleric Ragefire debacle.

Except that I'd make the triggered mob *harder* than the
once-a-week version.  That way you could make your choice
between getting your epic pieces by waiting for a lucky
drop (or /random) from easier long-spawn (or rare drop) mob,
*or* a truly epic-level fight that you could engage in
whenever you had a big enough force ready/willing to help
you.

"Epic" quests should be *hard* (i.e., big hard memorable
fights), not merely tedious as hell (i.e. wait, wait,
and wait some more).
