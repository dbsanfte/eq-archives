}>(A) As others pointed out, you're conveniently ignoring the word 'if'.
}So you wait to plan until it happens!!???
}I can tell YOU have never been in the military...  :^)

True, I haven't.  My father was USMC, though.  He was put in charge, at 
one point, of guarding a file cabinet full of top-secret contingency 
plans.  He said itwas some of the most boring reading he's ever done.  
This suggests to me that they probably do not have a plan for an attack by 
a foreign power that has formed an alliance with the small furry people 
from Neptune.  Now, HIV may have slightly higher odds of becoming a more 
serious problem for US children, but I'd be suprised if PBS thinks it's so 
likely that they've madea concrete planned response yet.

Oh yes, and PBS is also not the military.  They tend to be a bitmore 
easygoing about things.  I can't say I'm suprised you couldn't spot the 
difference though.

}>(B) You're also ignoring that the first quote makes no reference to 
}>    muppets with HIV at all.  They may, after all, tailor their response 
}>    to this different audience.
}Yea, and they may climb on a cow and jump over the moon..

Stranger things have happened.

}Considering they lied the first time, why should they have any
}credibility with me/??

You still haven't established that they lied the first time, 
despite repeating it 53 dozen times.  In order for us to consider things 
on the basis that they have lied, you would first have to provide even 
ashredof evidence that they -did- lie.  However, that doesn't mean they 
should have any credibility with you, since you seem resolutely determined 
to not trust them.

}>Sounds like reassuring people that they will make a plan someday if they 
}>feel they need to.  And again, you've pointed out a fine example of 
}>statements that don't contradict.  Reading is Fundamental.
}Oh yea.. REAL reassuring..
}"We don't have a PLAN now, but IF it happens, we'll begin to form a
}plan and might be ready to start planning our planning sessions in
}12-15 years..."

I think you overestimate how long it would take by about a factor of 100.  
If it happens, they could probably come up with something in a couple 
months.

}Are you really THAT naive???

If by that you mean, not naive at all, then yes, I am that naive.
