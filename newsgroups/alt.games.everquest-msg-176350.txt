If you're going to spend that much time gathering cash just so you
could pay someone to PL you, why not just use the time to level
yourself? Shamans can solo from early levels since they can melee
early on, and they have offensive spells. I hope you're not being
lazy, and have to turn to this.

Power-Leveling isn't frowned upon by GMs and Guides as long as you
don't interfere with those around you. The biggest consequence with
PLing casters is the resulting feeble skills from complete lack of
development. It can be crippling to you once you've stopped PLing and
actually make the effort to fight on your own or with a group.
