Tinkering is not level capped, but is sort of weird.  It's fixed at 50
for Gnomes (who are the only ones who can ever improve it) until they
reach level 16, at which point they can raise it all the way to 250
like other tradeskills.

Alchemy and Research are also sort of weird in that they are level
capped but not relative to level 1.  I.e., they're not (level + 1) x 5
as for most other level caps; they're (level - 15) x 5 for
research (which is especially weird since it means when you put the
first point in you get the skill at 16, which is above your cap!)
and (level - 24) x 5 for alchemy.

I've never looked at Poisons but a quick check suggests that skill
is level capped in the usual way: (level + 1) x 5.
