This makes about a dozen times I've seen either of two versions of this
statement made in several forums. I've yet to see a direct link to a
Microcrap site to get the official word.

One statement always seems to be like yours saying the license changed
and you "can't" disable that function. The other, longer, one seems to
say that you can't disable that function *if* you want to sell the
product labeled as being "Microsoft XP Compliant", with that little
sticker on the package.

Somehow I doubt Sony gives a rat's ass at this point whether or not EQ
is certified as XL compliant. Unless of course it's already on their
expansion packages (not home to check) in which case they may have to do
it.
