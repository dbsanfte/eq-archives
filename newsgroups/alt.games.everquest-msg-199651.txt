Ok 1 will be solstice earing, as I already have 3/4 the pieces.
How would you rank the others though?  Im going to have to just buy 1,
looking where those drop... so if Im gonna spend xx I may as well get the
best one for the price

I thought that only mattered for pet canni..?  I mean, I don't really cast
many conjuration spells other than the first 10 mins of logging on the mage.

I saw a nocturnal phantasms for 30k, seemed a little excessive.  If I were
to buy that, It would go on jak anyway!  (thats the JC made helm, right?)
Problem with PoNB its just such a dire zone.  Unslowable mobs, big agro
ranges, crappy exp, oh sign me up already!

I saw an ice silk cap in the bazaar (a few pieces of ice silk, infact) but
it all looked horribly expensive for the stats on it.  I know the silks are
hard to come by, ice burrowers being ghey to fight and all that.. but the
price should reflect the stats!

I use ring of gallantry, and summoned ring, at present.  I have a spare PoE
ring I could swap for the gallantry (or wear both, and get the focus
elsewhere).  I did have a ring of winter, but Im damned if I know where the
hell it went.  It was on jak before he upgraded but when I looked in my
various banks, I couldn't locate it :(   What kind of order would you put
them in?

I had wristband of stratergy on a mule so he now wears this.  Still need to
pick up another, once I replace my damage focus.

Earthweave arms acquired.

Guess I shoulda posted here first, before trying 2 robe combines! /mourn my
lost items

See jak... I can put dain cloak on lall, and make jaks cloak of the brood..
assuming its not a big downgrade for jak (whos still going to be very much a
main, whilst mage is for off times)

White dragonscale was 40k in the bazaar.... ID3 is nice, but what about
jungle spider cap, thats ID3 for a lot cheaper.. and he's gonna be 60+ soon
enough that ID4 will be required!
Only problem with the cap, by god is it FUGLY.  WTB more non-visible hats!

I just sold one of these on my mule, for a friend. Oh well I didn't realise,
looking flash isn't that important

Saw one for 10k or so when I first looked, again seemed overpriced.  If you
think that sounds fair though, its not like I don't have the plat.

He has halas pies and grobb liquidised meat,for now.

What right clickes are available out there?  I took the suggestions here to
try Velk, he went down first time.  Me, Girlf cleric, a bot cleric, guild
warrior and random bots.

It was closer than I'd anticipated.. we fought him unslowed (got a lot of
contradicting advice on this, tried twice and then switched to heals, didn't
occur to me to be in melee range to slow tho)

Anyway he dropped an ENC hat with some weak right click, a WIZ range with
another weak right click, 2 other pieces of junk, and a spellbook.   Oh well
spellbook is some plat... the rest just stayed on the corpse to rot (did ooc
it, but I doubt the average velks player would know the way, or navigate it
safely)

Magelo Updated for now.
