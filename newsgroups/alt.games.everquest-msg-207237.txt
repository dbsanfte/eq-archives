Most likely the same reason anyone else does something punitive to another
person.  Either:

A) The right button was pushed at the wrong time, or;

B) The same button was pushed too many times in a row.

Given my time on Test, I'd tend to think that in this case the answer is
'B', but I wasn't there for this incident.

If the last time you played on test was back when 50 was the max, my guess
is that it's a fairly safe bet that the GM staff has turned over a bit since
the last time you were there.  That's not a criticism, mind you ... just a
statement of fact.  Finding someone who's stayed in the same IS job for 2+
years is somewhat remarkable anymore.  I've been in the same job for going
on 6 years myself, and I've seen a heckuva lot of folks come and go.

Heck, with 6 years in, I'm considered something pretty damn close to part of
the furniture in the office at this point.
