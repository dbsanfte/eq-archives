It is neither pointless, nor stupid to respond to
remarks made in a newsgroup.

What is stupid, is posting in a public forum, and
then complaining that someone has responded to
their remarks.

Replies are intended for everyone to read, not
just the person being replied to.

Do you have conference phone calls with hundreds
of people all listening in on the conversation?

If one person hung up, would that mean any
conversation about that person, or what that
person had said, was prohibited

Can you not see the difference between being in a
newsgroup killfile, and being on someones email
blocked sender list?

A newsgroup is public, and when you post to it,
you are inviting comment from anyone who can see
the message. If you want to confine replies to a
select few, then use email, where you have control
over who replies and who doesn't.

On Usenet you have no control.
