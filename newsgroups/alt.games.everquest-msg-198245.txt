Why would it be harder to make AA's at 65?   Imo AA's get easier, the more
you progress in the game.

I remember full well the days of 12,921 velks spiders per AA, the increases
in PoV, HoH etc.
Now, in PoE, I can make an aa in 30 mins or so.

Imo level to 65, then AA.  But I just like getting one thing out of the way
before I start something else (my AA % was always all or nothing... 0 or
100..)

As for HoV - do you have the spell currently?  If not, I wouldn't use this
as the reason for dinging..  its still a pretty rare spell, and on Prexus at
least is selling for 70k
