OK, this has been bugging me on and off for years, since they introduced 
mounts.

Unpredicably, sometimes people can open a trade window with you while 
you're on a  mount, and sometimes they can't

IT never seemed to be consistent, and wasn't really a solid enough 
nuisance to really work on.

Well yesterday I finally figured it out.

I'm sure I'm not the first, and probably others have told me what to 
do... but they never explained why and I never really got it consistently

Trading back and forth between my bot and myself though, both with 
mounts, I was able to see exactly what was happening, instead of just 
someone trying to trade with me and saying they couldn't, or me trying 
to trade with them and getting the 'drop stuff on the floor' message.

Looking at it, turns out that if I trade down low in the center, I can 
open a window, while anywhere else on the horse or the rider fails.

Even Under the horse, clicking on air, works, as long as its in the 
center under the rider

When I brought this up, other people told me their workaround; click on 
the stirrups, or on the  riders feet.

That works. lower works too, higher doesn't.

Why?

Because (and here's the revelation) you have to click on where the 
player would be if he wasn't mounted.  The mount is an illusion, really 
the toon is occupying only its original space.  That means its standing 
on the ground, with its shoulders at around that "stirrup height"

Further, it has to be that way, because some people won't have the new 
model turned on for that race; the old model has no horse and is just 
standing there.

People who don't have the new model on for you never have any trouble 
trading with you.  You never have trouble trading with someone who has 
the old model.

Because the old model is where they really are, not up on that big 
illusion of a horse.
