You don't think there's ambiguity whenever two people think they both had 
that giant in Rathe? Come on. Compared to a system that defines who owns the 
mob independent of human perception, EQ is ambiguity squared.

Heh, there's your ambiguity. Seriously, you're giving way too much credit to 
ideal human perception. People make mistakes, people are sometimes jerks, 
people are sometimes just tired, etc. I've seen so many cases where someone 
started screaming "KS" and I could just tell that the accused may very well 
have had a legitimate basis for thinking he was attacking a free mob. I'm 
not saying it's totally vague and unknowable, I'm just saying that EQ leaves 
room for ambiguity, especially compared to a system like WoW's.
