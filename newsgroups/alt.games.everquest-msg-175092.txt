Yeah unfortunately some players who don't group much make a group suffer
because they lack the ability to work effectively as a team.  Albeit there
are ppl who group and are just as bad, but in the long run to mmost things
post 50 you needs groups/guilds to help make it happen.

Too each his own but IMO soloing makes EQ too much like any game I could
just play offline.
