Of our four cats, three seem as thick as a brick. One, however, I think
shows definite signs of criminal genius.  Our little ritual around our
house is that when we get up in the morning on weekdays, I go to work
and my wife feeds the pets. When she comes back into the kitchen they
will stand by the empty food dishes and meow loudly and pathetically as
if they've not eaten in years. (They always have dry food and water, but
in the morning they get canned food which there is a fight over, though
there are enough dishes for all.)  Once this is done, pet food subjects
are ignored until the next morning. The cats all know the routine.

On the weekends, however, when I stay at home, sometimes I will be the
one to feed the cats if Georg is away, sleeping in, etc. One of our
cats, Spider by name, has caught on to this. If my wife gets up first,
the cats all meow loudly and are fed. Then if I come downstairs and we
are *BOTH* in the kitchen, the cats go about their business. However, if
I come down after they have eaten, and my wife is gone, or in another
room, Spider will run over to the now empty dish and start up the
meowing routine. This has happened a bunch... too much for concidence.
She waits until I'm alone and then tries to make me think Georg forgot
to feed them. The little shit has pulled this trick successfully at
least twice, and been busted a bunch more times when I yell into the
den, "Honey? Did you feed the cats?"

"Yes"

/em glares at Spider threateningly.

Spider drops her head, stops meowing and trots into the basement.
