    He hasn't claimed it IS someone else's fault he's lagging, or engaged.
His complaint is this: in a game about the fantasy era, it seems annoying
that not a single combat is initiated in "chivalrous" ways. It's all about
"I caught you with your pants down, prepare to die fast and hard!!!!" You
saying "Don't take your pants down, then" ignores that entirely. He objects
to the culture of the gacker, the very nature of PvP combat on the PvP
servers.

    Note: if your server actually HAD people on it, you'd find that "finding
a quiet place to XP" is a little harder than it seems. Especially if you
choose to play one of the several classes that cannot solo effectively in a
gear-poor environment like a Zek.

    And there's his problem - you want to kill JUST ANY PERSON, the more
helpless the better. The only motivation for your killing folks seems to be,
well, they're there. He wants MOTIVATED PvP, not some random gack-a-thon.
That's why I snicker when people talk about the Zeks being the "truer"
roleplaying environment - sure it is, if Norrath was populated entirely by
psychotics.

    Again, you must be on a Zek to say Skyfire is empty - it sure isn't on
my server. If nothing else it's farmed for the spell drops.

    You MUST be a good PvPer if you can tell if someone has DoT slots and
PvP spells memmed just by looking at them. :-/

    It is their fault for staying there, very true. But this is what people
want from a PvP system, and when it isn't met they get angry: motivated PvP.
They want there to be a REASON beyond "because I could" for someone to
attack someone else. They furthermore do NOT want someone to be able to
evade PvP if a motivation beyond "because I could" exists - no lipping
someone, then not accepting the /duel. Blue servers have the first feature,
Zeks have the second. I get the idea most people want the Zeks to have both.

    Um, how about because you spend every waking minute worrying about
getting killed? Because you play a solo class that can hide and gain XP
without anyone else? Because you don't mind never seeing any of the really
cool endgame stuff, but focus on gacking folks to gain a sense of
accomplishment?

    I remember you once posted the guild list for some of the higher-level
members of DB. I remember looking at that list and thinking it looked like
the "original character I don't play anymore because they suck so hard"
lists top guilds have. Then I realized why you were so proud of it: because
on your server, doing what you like to do best (kill folks), those WERE the
endgame classes. Again, these "weak PvPers" have a different endgame desire
than you: they want to do the top encounters like blue servers do. They see
PvP as an aspect of the server, not the entire point. They should know
better by now. ;-)

>Please, just learn what the FUCK you are doing in PvP. And I am serious,
>I am a known pk and even now that I'm not guilded in a pk guild

    Did DB finally get disbanded for good, or did you just move on?
