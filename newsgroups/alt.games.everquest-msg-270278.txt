DAoC has quite a few quests with interesting stories.  You can check out a
lot of them at daoc.warcry.com, which will let you search by level and realm
and class, so you can get an idea of whether or not there would be enough at
each level to be interesting to you.

I haven't tried the new expansion, but it should make quests a lot easier to
find--it adds a system like WoW's that marks NPCs that have quests for you.

I seem to recall you are not a fan of PvP.  You don't have to PvP in DAoC,
but if you do try the game, don't dismiss PvP.  The way it is set up you
generally can't be PKed unless you want to engage in PvP (I'll give the one
exception below), and the PvP activity tends to be organized, with goals
that fit in with the game's story.  I had a great time in the battleground,
for example, as my realm tried to take the central keep.  We had a trebuchet
and a catapault set up, hurling big rocks at the keep, and archers up on the
towers on the bridge over the moat.  They were sending out nukers to try to
get our archers, and I was playing a stealthing character, so was sneaking
around stealthed behind their lines, trying to find nukers who stopped too
long, to get behind and backstab.  Think of Crushbone in EQ1, but with the
Orcs being players, and that's what it was like.

The one major exception is the Darkness Falls dungeon.  One realm at a time
has access to it, based on which realm controls the most keeps in the
frontier.  When access to DF changes hands, those people currently in it are
*not* kicked out.  So, if your realm has access to DF, there might still be
people from other realms in there, so you could get PKed.
