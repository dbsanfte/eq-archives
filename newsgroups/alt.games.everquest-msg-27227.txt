I guess I needn't explain that I agree... mainly because I used to
possess zero (0) game when it came to girls.  I'm no casanova, don't
get me wrong, but after careful realization, and a load of hard work
(on myself) I found that my confidence was back (not just with
girls... but everything).  It was probably the most empowering thing
that has ever happened to me.  I am a firm believer that anyone can
accomplish anything if they put their mind to it... my mother, for
example.  She had probably the most horrifying family life I HAVE EVER
HEARD OF... she is fine, emotionally and physically, is a great loving
woman, and incredibly light hearted and funny.  She will admit
however, that it took a lot of work to get to where she is now.


Confidence is a big heavy stone.  It takes a lot of work to get
rolling, but once its rolling, its easy to keep going.
