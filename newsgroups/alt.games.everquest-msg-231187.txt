Another interesting aspect, is that virtual world currency could 
eventually used thus:

Suppose I want to move a million bucks from England to the US... bank 
transfers and wires of significant cash are all recorded, and carrying 
that much cash will likely be questioned at the border... but if I could 
purchase a million bucks worth of game currency, and then convert back 
after crossing the border the virtual game worlds could become 
underworld cash havens.

It would require virtual worlds to have large, stable economies, with 
sizable interchange with real world currencies... if that ever happened 
it would be come a very portable, highly liquid, virtually untraceable 
asset...
