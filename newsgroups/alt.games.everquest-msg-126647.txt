Bah, I thought OTT had convinced you to be a BadJew(tm).  You finally
decided that bacon is enough of a guilty pleasure without the added
spice of defying the word of G-d?  I've found that being a
BadAtheist(tm) is a lot of fun.  Prayer is a lot more fun when it's
something you're supposed to NOT practice.  :)
I actually know several practicing followers of Zoroastrianism.  If
you're looking for a religion that will confuse your friends, it's up
there.  Of course they really don't accept conversions, so you have to
convince them that you really were a Zoroastrian all along, you just
didn't realize it.
