MB is a A7A266 (Socket A, ALiMaGiK 1 Chipset, DDR RAM/SDRAM).

CPU is an AMD (K - ??) 1.4 GHZ (Don't have the exact specs.)

I just set the system up last night, so I have the problem as of last night 
(three times in a row!)

As a result, I am playing on my OLD system ( :( ) in the mean time. (Major :( 

I have a GeForce2 MX400 with 64 MB of SDRAM on my "old" system right now. I 
am thinking on ripping it out of this system and putting it in my new 
computer (it is a PCI card) and returning the AGP card to my supplier. 

Anyway, I am not having any joy here.
