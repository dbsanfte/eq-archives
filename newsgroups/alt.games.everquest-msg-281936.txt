Man, I love this idea.
I would buy an expansion just to have this ability.

Would be nice if just below their name
you would see the text summary you made of them.

Given a warrior you grouped with before named (Badasstank)
Looking at him you would see...

	Badasstank
    rude guy that kept
    going afk while MA

And the text color would be:
- red for negative
- white for neutral
- green for positive

And, I would really like to see this text be based on account
rather than person's name!  Wouldn't that be a hoot.

So, 3 months later you see...

	Supahnuker
    rude guy that kept 
    going afk while MA
