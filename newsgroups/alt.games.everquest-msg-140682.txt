Few comments beforehand
1. RvR in DAOC is fun. When there's enough people there. And when forces 
are about equal. Taking it in the hole daily from an army triple your 
size sucks

2. Combat Styles in DAOC add quite a bit to the enjoyment of the game. 
At least some variety over auto-attack-taunt-taunt-sit

3. Downtime is a hell of a lot less than in EQ

4. Soloing acually works. For 90% of classes. In some cases more 
efficient than pickup groups

5. You can build your character differently. In EQ a wizard is a wizard. 
In DAOC they have flavors

6. There's no camping in DAOC. If I'd have to camp JBoots or FBSS again, 
I'd hang myself

7. A non-SoW class actually has chances of running away from a bad 
fight, if he starts early

8. There's no twinking in DAOC. Ever see a level 5 monk in Fungi shirt, 
RBG and with a weapon that is sold on ebay for more than my computer is?

9. There's no trains in DAOC.

It's not quite that trivial at higher levels. Some say it hurts worse 
than in EQ. Regardless, it is geared more towards people that can play 
in smaller chunks of time. In other words people who can't stick around 
for a 5 hour corpse recovery after the raid failed.

> The interface - sucks - no where near as customisable as EQ's

LOL! Over the last half a year EQ has been shamelessly ripping DAOC off. 
Compare DAOC's interface to that of EQ half a year ago and see.

Actually this is a bad example, since this is the single prettiest and 
least informative/useful skin

Yup. Which were added to EQ over two years after release. Give DAOC two 
years?

You mean zoning takes longer than in EQ?

Possibly. My machine is slower, and it didn't bother me too much. 
Although going from some areas to some did get me stuck for a second or 
two

And that NEVER happens in EQ?! Well, not that exactly, but KSing?
