Not I.

The great enjoyment I get out of EverQuest isn't the zones, the mobs,
the (less than) fancy graphics it's the people with whom I play.

I am fortunate to be in a great guild (Jesters of Norrath) on Antonius
Bayle and it is these people whom I class a good gaming friends.

What, then, is the point of moving elsewhere?  If I did move from
EverQuest then it would be, perhaps, to something like AC2 and not
another Sony/Verant game.
