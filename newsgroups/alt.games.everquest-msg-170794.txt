Ahhh, that explains it. I knew about the AAxp, but didn't realize it was the
source of the titles. As I understand it, after the 51st season one has the
option of diverting specified amounts of experience toward either AA or
standard levels. So, someone with both a "Baron" title and 65 seasons truly
is an elder worthy of all due respect!

Thanks for the information, and I hope to see Nimok on the battlefields
someday!
