Haven't bothered with it yet but what is your AGP aperture set to?
Commonly, it is believed that half the system ram is the best setting for
this aperture...but, like virtual memory settings, this theory came around
when PC's had 64 or even 128mb of ram...not 256 or 512mb. If you have set it
to 256 then try it at 128. Setting the aperture to 256mb is often the cause
of minor graphic problems, I am not sure if this is down to MoBo, VGA card
or game but in EQ I was getting minor glitches the worst of which was seeing
thru walls when getting close to them.
