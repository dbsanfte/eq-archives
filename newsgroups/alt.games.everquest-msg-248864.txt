Ugh, The no drop flag is all that's stopping the game turning into a 
level 65 only arcade game. The only way they could drop the no drop flag 
would be if they instead enforced a minimum price on transfers. So you 
could buy anything but you'd need to have earned the money first. Just 
like in real life.

> 2)add graveyards and bindable spots to god zones.

Bad idea. Take away all the fun of high risk-vs-reward. Instead I've 
give necros a group summon corpse spell which summons all the groups 
corpses at once to shadowrest. So you could recover the corpses quickly 
and easily but without reducing the risk-vs-reward of the zones too badly.

/shrug

> 4)remove the essence emerald from necro res.

Hmm as a necro I'd like this... But for game balance I'd prefer that 
they reduced the cost back to the 200pp or so they were when they 
started from the 500pp they are now. Maybe allow 75% rezes on sacrificed 
corpses might do it by increasing the supply.

Why? How would you justify that?

How would that help anything? Beastlord clarity is helpful but hardly great.

Huh? No. I'd do just the oposite and reduce the limit to 4 and 
rebalance. Would make the game more fun.

Ugh no. Just the reverse again. Get rid of the stupid raid encounters 
and make someother way to get the keys. The VP is great. It's something 
where you can work on the bulk of it solo or in a tiny group when you 
have free timne over several months instead of having to get together 70 
people in a stupid increadibly boring raid to get a flag. I'd like to 
see a lot more stuff like the VP key.

Ugh. Again this makes no sense in the world.

I liked velious and kunark best. They had lots to do for all levels and 
addded a whole lot of story and made the world seem *big* and 
interesting. POP and LDON shrunk the world and made it more of a single 
encounter video game. LDON was fun though but I'm still not sure that 
the world wouldn't be better without it for long term interest in the game.
