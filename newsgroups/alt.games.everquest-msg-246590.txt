Well, Dorothy and I wound up starting new alts couple days ago and right now
they're sitting level 8. Richard's got his tanker at 5, probably higher
after soloing tonight. You will hit 5 in one evening's play. On a Saturday
you could easily get to level 8 without breaking a sweat. Even without the
sidekicking, groups made up 5-9 or so are completely viable for the kind of
missions we'll be getting at that level. A key level is 7, after whch you
can enter Perez Park and start using L10 Enhancers.
