I've read the procedures at everquest.com for creating a guild however
I have a question that i'm sure some of you can answer for me. I
haven't been able to find a solid answer in the news groups or on
sony.

After the Guild has been approved and you receive an e-mail confirming
this, it states you must petition a GM in-game to actually create the
Guild. My question is do all 10 accounts that were used in Chat to
start the Guild need to be present in-game or just the Guild Leader?
