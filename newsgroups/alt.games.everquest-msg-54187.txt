I had a druid in a similar fix around level 52. You need several items
to switch to for say a dragon you need cold or fire res for and the
like. This is what I did:

Bought a couple blue diamonds, had max skill jeweler friend make the
blue diamond electrum earrings which are good resses. You can just buy
them already made too but costs more

Buy the plat diamond or whatever rings that are 7 to all resses. The
velium diamond or something are plus 8 but the jeweler said they might
fail and since I had bought the diamonds for one k each, I was not
chancing it. Plus 7 all is fine. 

Have those in a bag with things like the venerable polar bear cloak
(plus 15 cold res, or oracle cloak which drops sometimes in crystal
caverns and gives 2 wis and cold res, so nice) and the kunzer cloak, 2
wis and plus 7 fire res (or was it more than seven) and a very nice
item, the froglock crown which is 12 ac and plus 20 cold and fire
reses or you could go with a blue diamond tiara but thats much harder
to buy or get made (is like 8 all resses.. but really for the cold and
fire mainstay dragons the froggy crown is best)

As a druid much of my regular equip had some cold resses on it but I
was lacking in other resses.

Oh and I did this quest around level 54:

Rough Silver Chain   
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  
AC: +5 Magic Resist: +5 Fire Resist: +5 Cold Resist: +5 Poison Resist:
+5 Disease Resist: +5 HP: +30 Mana: +30  
Weight: 0.3 
Classes: Cleric Druid Shaman Wizard Magician Enchanter Necromancer  
Races: All Races  
Inventory Slot: Neck

As a shaman though you'll have to MQ part of the quest with a druid or
ranger I think because the forage is no drop in this quest:

http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=1224

"Give the Ooze and Fresh Tree Sap (foraged in Wakening lands - no drop
item) to Pythic Urson in Thurgadin "

So the druid would give the tree sap first then you'd give the ooze
after so you got the next no drop item. Oh and you both need the
faction to do it of course.

That is a great item.. its part of my perm wearing kit now. I went
from having no real res stuff at all at level 51 to by level 55 having
206 wis with a constant 87 mr, 93 cold res and 90 fire res as my BASE
with my regular equip (and I think dis and poison of 70). Of course
for a druid AC is not such a big regular equip concern as it is for a
shaman. ALso I've got the velious skyshrine quest arms, cap and one
bracer which helps a lot as far as wis ;) I also have several other
items including a shield with poison res to switch to as needed. 

I believe the shaman epic also has lots of good resses and is one of
the easier ones to get if you are in a guild that can do the mobs.
About every shaman I see 50 plus now has that epic.

Ah yes:
