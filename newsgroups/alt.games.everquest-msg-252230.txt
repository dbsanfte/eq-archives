The lawyer, doctor, plumber, electrician, and grass-mower are frequently 
ripped off by non-paying customers.

However there are some key differences.

1) Doctors, lawyers, plumbers etc aren't stupid enough to accept paypal, 
as they know full well they cannot prove their services were ever 
delivered to paypal's satisfaction.

2) Doctors etc have key personal information they can use to launch a 
suit to recover their fees. Doctors have your medical records, plumbers 
and mowers have your address, etc. Many of these people have you sign 
work orders (a contract) before performing any services as well.

3) Their is no pre-existing EULA hanging over the whole situation that 
asserts that conducting your business is prohibited in the first place. 
e.g. A lawyer doesn't sell patents in in a country that explicitly 
states there is no intellectual property rights. A doctor doesn't 
prescribe treatments that are not approved by the appropriate regulatory 
body. Etc.
