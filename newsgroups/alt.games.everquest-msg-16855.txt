I ran across what appeared to be a high elf female NPC on the side of the
road between Kaladam and the docks.  Her name was Walnan and she first
responded (when I hailed her) if I was an elementalist. Since I was playing
a magician I figured close enough and said I was and so she responded if I
was interested in learning about "Magi'kot".  I said everything I could
think of to her and got no further response.  Does anyone know anything
about this quest?  (I checked at allakhazams site but didn't see anything
there.)
