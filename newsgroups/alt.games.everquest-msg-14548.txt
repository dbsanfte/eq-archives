Lord, and I just though people complained to give you and Tyger something to
do.  Seriously, though this is a good game most of the time, but VI is very
poor with customer relations, and causes a lot of its own problems with its
customers.  Also there are times testing seems to leave a great deal to be
desired or problems go undressed or are denied for long periods of time.
All of these things cause frustration and lead people to complain, the
chronic complainers, however, likely would not be happy if the game were as
bug free and playable as checkers, and guys like Morse Code and company are
simply part of the annoyance that comes with any large newsgroup.
