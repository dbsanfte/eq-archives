Are you kidding?  That robe is far too drab for 'flaming gay'.

}But, maybe it'll look better on a female,

Nope.  Not to me, anyway.

Eew, the bathrobe.  I actually prefer the GSD to that.  Robe of the Keeper 
was lovely, and my FBR is pretty nice.  I'm very much tempted not to 
upgrade at all until Zin can twink me out with something more attractive 
than any of the mid-range alternatives I see.  Maybe an Advisor Robe.
