I enjoy humiliating idiots. You qualify.

Listen, fucknuts, I am telling you what I was arguing. Your little
spin for attention is getting old fast.

Roleacting was defined by KOSTER to be your narrow definition of
roleplaying. It was NEVER my definition of acting OR roleplaying, you
pedantic jackass.

Okay, twit, try to follow along.

Still with me, twit, or have I lost your infantile mind yet? This is
half. This is where I call it acting. As far as I am concerned acting
and roleplaying are interchangeable terms. See the definition below if
you still have the idiotic idea they aren't. Furthermore....

>>Roleplaying isn't just your "thee and thou" rp nazi. Any time you're
>>taking the role of your character you're roleplaying. 

Here, twit, is where I clarify that I consider the broad definition of
roleplaying to be acting. Or are you too stupid to understand what
acting is?

acting
v. act�ed, act�ing, acts
v. tr.

   1. To play the part of; assume the dramatic role of: She plans to
act Lady Macbeth in summer stock.
   2. To perform (a role) on the stage: act the part of the villain.

So, twit, hopefully even your sad intellect has figured out what I
meant by both roleplaying and acting. If you need further education,
please, continue this retarded speil you keep spinning.

You've already lost, twit. You neither know what roleplaying is nor
apparently what acting is. Declaring victory when your house is in
shambles is as transparent as it is false.

That is, in the end, the only point you seem to actually be willing to
defend on topic, and its sadly nothing more than a flame.

Thank you for defining yourself as a troll, twit.

You, twit, are apparently not intelligent enough to keep up. It was my
mistake your mental state was higher than the initial two year old
mewling of "why? why? why?" I won't make the same mistake twice, and
you, twit, will be treated with the disrespect all idiots like you
deserve.

You don't comprehend anything, you merely whine. Twit.

Even when the point is spelled out for you you fail to answer.

So much for your pseudointellectualism.

Please tell you you aren't as dumb as you appear to be. NO ONE can be
that dumb. Here's a hint, dumbass, go look at Koster defining
role-acting. It is not the same as what I call acting, it is what
narrowminded rp nazis define as roleplaying.

If you are incapable of even telling who said what, you shouldn't be
allowed near electrical appliances let alone usenet.

I'll reiterate it for your idiotic moronic mind.

Roleacting: a word defined by Koster to represent the narrow thee and
thouish version of roleplaying
Acting: a word defined by me as a person playing any role at all.

Do I need a fucking drill to get this into your bloated head?

You tried to act like an impassionate intellectual, and were found
wanting. Now you're crying like a baby.

My logic has never changed, twit. The only thing that has is my
estimation of your intelligence given your utter refusal to listen to
anything anyone has to say. ie.. troll.

You *still* don't understand anything I said, do you?

Maybe when you're older.

Okay. I was wrong. You've graduated from twit to utter shitforbrains.

The point was, is, and always was, if your pitiful brain can handle
it:

People can roleplay more freely, ACT however they want, when they are
anonymous.

Holy shit! What a revelation!

The rest of this was simply showing you to be the dithering idiot you
are after you stumbled over the word "acting", which you apparently
have never heard of, and its relationship of "roleplaying", which you
have even less knowledge of.

I'll spell out your biggest mistake for you, dipshit. Your narrow
definition of roleplaying - roleacting, thee and thou bullshit, is not
the only definition of roleplaying. It's a narrow definition which has
nothing to do with my initial point.

Consider yourself educated, twit.
