I'd expect that in every big MMORPG.  Everquest has had eight, Ultima
Online six, Dark Age of Camelot four, with a fifth almost out, Anarchy
Online three, FFXI two, Asheron's Call one going on two, SWG one, City
of Heroes...  Is there any big[1] MMO that has been out for,
say, a year and a half, and hasn't had an expansion?  I know City of
Heroes has an expansion planned, I'm not sure about Lineage 2.

Not to mention that most succesful non-MMO PC games get expansions,
too - all the Blizzard games, The Sims, Civilization III, the Total
War series, Heroes of Might&Magic, Medal of Honor, Morrowind, etc.  It
just makes economic sense to do it that way, unless it scares off
subscribers.  I don't think it does, but I could be wrong.

[1] Over, say, 100k subscribers, so not e.g. AC2 or EVE or A Tale in
the Desert
