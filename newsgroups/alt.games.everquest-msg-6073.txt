That's a great question that I honestly don't know the definitive answer to.
My guess is that the directory grows larger each patch day.  As to whether
the files for each of your characters grows enough to matter that much, I
don't have a clue. :(

One thing, though ... I've got EQ, RoK, and SoV loaded.  If you have EQ with
RoK the directory is probably considerably smaller ... smaller still with
the $9.99 EQ-only box that's in stores now.  The directory will more than
likely pop the 1 gig barrier with the Luclin expansion.

Just don't buy a white one before Memorial Day! <g>  Or is it Easter?  Heck,
everything goes with jeans, so I never paid attention.

You're more than welcome.  Happy to help!
