Nope.  Can right-click to forget but many times can't right-click to get 
the menus to select a spell to mem.  Also can't right-click on the 
spellbook icon to either save a set or load a set.  Haven't had _any_ 
trouble until LDoN came out.  Even exiting the program and restarting it 
doesn't always recover them
