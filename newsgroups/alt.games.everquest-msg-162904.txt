Won't work.  How are you going to get the LD handler to DA you 
after a 12 second wait?

If you mean you'll be home free if you get smacked more than 12 seconds
after going LD, that won't work either, because getting hit
resets your LD timeout countdown.  So you'll have at least another
30 seconds starting from when you got hit and DA'ed.  Thus you're
still in the same situation as you describe here:

That would happen either way.

Nope.

Think longer.
