Actually a 'hard' aggro from the swarm is not really a big deal either.  Put enough distance
between you and the swarm and they all lock on your pet no matter what.  Will take
some experience to be good at this because the pets health will not register at that distance.

You have to know how long you can sit out there before your pet is too low on health and
you have to break charm or he goes *poof*.  But soft aggro is always more preferred.  Just not always possible.
