I've had that problem for months.

A friend installed Win2K and also experienced it so I believe it's Win2K
related.

Here's my setup:

Compaq DeskPro 600MHz/356MB RAM/9GB HD (5GB free)
Win2K Professional (with all updates)
DirectX 8
DSL Modem (Alcatel 100 - static IP)
Voodoo 5 AGP card w/latest drivers
No sound card  (using on-board sound)
LinkSys 4-port DSL Router with DHCP enabled (I haven't checked to see if
this is the problem)

Norton Auto-Protect disabled
Pop-Up Killer disabled

If anyone has a fix I would be grateful.
