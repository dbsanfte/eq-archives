I've got it well practiced by now... here's the routine

SoW helps shave a couple of seconds off the run into Bazaar :o)
I have the port spell slot hotkeyed... and Gate and Circle of Nexus are both
on page 1 of the spell book, no page flipping...

Hit the Nexus port as soon as I've finished looting the last IG...
Porting in to Nexus you always face south... and bazaar is due east, so it's
always a 90 degree left turn
right-click Circle of Nexus as soon as you zone in to un-mem...
Go to Stable merchant first to unload the FS and Gems (won't be encumbered,
no matter how many gems are sold)
Run back to closest bank window... mem Gate... THEN bank while Gate
refreshes
Shift click your plat into gold into silver into copper... then reverse that
to dump it all into the bank, starting with plat, etc...
Close the bank window and hit Gate while still facing the Banker, I reappear
outside the IG fort facing south, turn 90 left and I can see my Monk resting
and waiting for the next IG...

2 minutes max... and that's if I fizzle a port
IGs are on a 6 minute timer, and my monk can take one down in about 2
minutes, so there's a slight difference in the two gaps... and I bank during
the longer gap.


Damn, I sound like a sad no-life :o)
