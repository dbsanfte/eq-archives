Thanks, I'll take a look.  I think I have enough residual knowledge in calc
to be able to put a math-intensive text to good use (it's sad when you can
talk about "math-intensive" calc texts, as that means that there are
"non-math-intensive" texts...).  Trig, OTOH, I sort of skipped, so I'll have
to go back and learn that from scratch.  I guess it's kinda important, since
I'll be studying architecture.

Anyways, sankyuu for the link, I'll see what I turn up.
