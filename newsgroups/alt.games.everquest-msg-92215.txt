The word "fear" was added for those who didn't know that's the only kiting
option we really have while soloing.  It's not the only non-charm option we
have...root/nuke works as well, though I really don't recommend it (or
kiting, or charming) as a solo practice.  Grab any caster snare class,
preferably one with dots (ok ok, druid or necro) and partner
snare/root/dot/nuke.  Safe, reliable and fast.
