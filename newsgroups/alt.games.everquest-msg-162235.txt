Well, it's not quite that bad.  You get a 2% discount for bitching or
moaning twice on the same day, 6% for three, 10% for four, 14% for five,
and 20% for 6 or more (it is unknown at this time whether bitches and
moans will be grouped or counted seperately for purposes of computing
the discount).

There is an unconfirmed rumor that Class Envy will actually be free
to anybody who sustains a "Claim of Nerfing" rate of 1/week minimum.

Look for early price increases on "l337" and "uber" labels, you know
that anything highly desired is always "nerfed" quickly by SOE.

This was a typo in the original release.  SOE expects this to be their
top moneymaker, the actual fee will be $25000.00 on a per guild basis.
