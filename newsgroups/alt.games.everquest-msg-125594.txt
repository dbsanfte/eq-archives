Oh, imp camo is wonderful. Won't break at an inopportune time, and I
don't have to retarget myself to use it. I do have to mem foliage
shield or plain old sup camo for groupmates (imp is self only), but
it's more than worth having for me.
As for 50+ spells, whether a level feels like christmas morning or
just 'damn, only one useful spell' depends heavily on what you do and
how available any given spell is.  For me, that meant I forked out to
get circle of seasons but didn't get fist of karana till it dropped on
a raid and nobody else had use of it (I haven't used it myself yet and
don't know if I ever will), while a non-raider who quad kites a lot
will want fist before anything and not worry about seasons at all.
