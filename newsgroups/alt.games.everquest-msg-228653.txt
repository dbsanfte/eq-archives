I made my wizard on the INT approach - I put 5 into STA to bring it to 80,
and everything else into INT.  At 65 with full buffs, I buff out to 3600hp,
which with epic is enough to get a Concussion off if I get summoned on
anything but a raid mob.  On a raid mob, if you get summoned you're doomed
anyway.

But by maxing out INT and manapool, I never run OOM except on raid mobs that
take a while - I can chain off nuke-nuke-concussion-nuke-nuke-concussion all
day long, never get summoned, and do VERY respectable damage.  (Oh, how I
wish for Ornate pants...)

If I were to make a new wizard, I'd put 5 or 10 points into STR instead of
STA, and put the rest into INT.  Why?  Because while I don't have much of an
HP problem, and I have no serious mana problem - I often find myself
encumbered!  Almost every bag I own has weight reduction, I still walk
around within 15 pounds of encumbered constantly.
