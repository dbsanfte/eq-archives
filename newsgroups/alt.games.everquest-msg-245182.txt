My maths aer teh gud.

I know one of you hard core min/max figuring types must know the answer 
to this.

I am pondering my wizard spells and recent equipment changes, skills, 
etc. to determine my most efficient setup for both grouping and on 
raids. Here's the dilema:

I'm not positive how various equipment effects stack up with other 
effects, or if they even do.

I have typically stuck with fire spells except where fire mobs resist 
them. I purchased the GoD AA ability Ro's Flaming Familiar, which 
purports to add 15% damage to all fire based DD nukes.

I have been, for a long time, wearing a belt that has ID4, supposedly 
+20% damage to all DD nukes. (Dusty Girdle of Reformed Sand)

I have just recently been awarded a drop off Agnarr which is a neck item 
(Amulet of the Rain if you are curious) which has the effect of Fury of 
Druzzil, which gives +30% damage to DD nukes, but ONLY to Magic based ones.

Ignoring any bard song additions for the moment (which I don't think 
stack with flappy anyway) how is my damage going to work out with the 
following spells:

Strike of Solusek - Base damage 2740, Mana cost 640, Fire based.
Agnarr's Thunder - Base damage 2305, Mana cost 580, Magic based.
Draught of Ro - Base damage 950, Mana cost 255, Fire based
Draught of Thunder - Base damage 950, Mana cost 255, Magic based.

Assume I have the fire flappy summoned and am wearing both items. When I 
cast SoS, am I getting 2740 x 1.15 x 1.20 (or 3699)? Am I getting 2740 x 
1.35 (or 3781)? Or is it ignoring flappy and taking the higher of the 
two, the 20% ID4 item (3288)? This would give a mana ratio anywhere from 
5.13 damage/mana to 5.90 depending on how it's calculated.

Agnarr's Thunder, with the +30% item looks to ring up 2996 (base plus 
30%) for a 5.16 damage/mana ratio. So how the percentages are actually 
calculated plays a lot into this decision. I'd be willing to give up the 
ID4 item and free up that slot and switch to primarily magic based nukes 
if it was more profitable, but I'll be pissed to lose the big boom crit 
numbers of SoS, not to mention the 15AA I flushed into that stupid 
flappy. *grimace*

Of course, these same questions would apply to the choice between the 
two draughts for situations where the draughts are more prudent to cast.

So, what' the REAL math behind the magic here?
