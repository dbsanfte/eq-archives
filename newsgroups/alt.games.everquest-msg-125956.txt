 Well. I disagreee. AC is Random. If he wasn't you wouldn't see all
these threads about people wanting to know how to get him to show up. If
he wasn't random he would pop in the same spot everytime. He doesn't.
Good luck saying "AC" and then trying to run all the way across the zone
when he pops before someone else sees him up and takes him out.
