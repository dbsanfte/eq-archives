Nope, Grolj (and the others) were undead types. Much like Commander Rottgrime
and the undead marines. No hint of them in the bestiary on allakhazam.
I'll check to see if they're there again tonite.

And my troll was indifferent to them, just like he is to the rest of the
Outpost, so hard to tell if they were on Venril Sather faction or one of
the funkier ones, like Beta Neutral.
