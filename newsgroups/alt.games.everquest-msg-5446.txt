This is done very easily you give him your account he will powerlevel your
character the easiest way possible. by using his characters to buff and get
yours alive or go do some higher level quests like the corrupt guards quest
and your character turns in the Items for the exp Sounds great till you try
going into this towns and find yourself KOS. Another problem with this is a
character the has been powerleveled and his skills my not be advanced enough
to survive at the higher levels example a level 30 caster or healer that can
not  cast a level 12 spell. All powerleveling does is give you more hit
points and not the skills that go with the level
