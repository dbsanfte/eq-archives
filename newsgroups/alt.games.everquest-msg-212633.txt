    Check if it's mezzable and rootable. If it is, park it in the corner
while you wait for the big cards to arrive. If not, put a paladin offtank on
it with a shaman for healing.

    I wouldn't worry. Attend a few more games, accumulate those DKP, and
soon you'll have a hand that will be the envy of all other players.

    Remember, it's the player and not the gear that's important. Sam's a
guildmate - don't hold his poor hand against him! If you do, he could leave
you for the local uberguild to try and pick up better cards.
