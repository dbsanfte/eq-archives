There are WAAAAAY more than 20 quests worth doing.

??? Never heard of that quest.

Do you mean the amulet of the Grey wastes?
Its a quest in Katta Castellum that requires Shissar Guts.
It has EB on it.

There's a couple hundred quests right there.

> Coldain Shawl

Don't forget the Kael Quest armor.

That's another couple hundred quests right there.
(Only 20? Yeah right)

> Rallic pack
> Trueshot Bow (Rangers)
> Nostrolo's Tamborine Quest (Bards)

> Coldaine Prayer Shawl

You listed the Coldain Shawl twice.

> Xp quests (low level)
> Gnoll Fangs in Qeynos and Halas
> Crushbone Belts and Shoulderpads

> Rat teeth in kerran isle

> Cash quests :

That is an excellent quest. I made a lot of money on it.

Uh yeah. Too many to list but here are some I like:

Cleric Ro breastplate in the Temple of Ro. It has
a nice focus effect on it now.

Ulthork tusk quest in CS. Can net you nice cash jewelry and if
you are lucky a blue diamond.

Shield of Bane warding quest in Katta Castellum.

Treant fists Quest for monk gloves.
Whistling fist Quest for Monks.
Robe of the Whistling Fists and Lost Circle.

Spirit Wracked cords, quest in Chardok.

Twilight sea quest armor. Some of the armor is sub-par
for the level required to get but there are a few nice pieces
in there. I got a great shoulder item for my enchanter and
cloak and bracer for my monk doing these quests.


Lots more.
