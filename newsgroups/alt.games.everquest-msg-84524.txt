Go to eqclient.ini.
Under [Defaults] type, "UseUmbra=FALSE" (without the quotation marks).  See
if that makes a difference.

For me, that turned the game from barely playable slide show to mostly
playable again.  Apparently, whatever Umbra is, it makes your system draw
things behind walls, etc, that you shouldn't be able to see.  Hence, the
choppyness in busy zones.
