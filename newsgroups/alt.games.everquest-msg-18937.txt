Experience awarded is based on the level of the mob you kill.  So no, the red
one would be worth more than the yellow one.  Probably not a great deal more,
since it's only one or two levels higher... but worth more.

And the answer to this one is a big fat maybe.

Trakanon would be worth much more experience, however there is an overall
maximum for the amount of experience you can gain from any one fight.

If the goblin in question was low red, you might not reach that limit.   High
red you might.   Trakanon you would.   So, there is a chance that the goblin
and Trak couuld both take you to your limit.



That being said... the way to get the most experience is not reds, or even
yellows, but a steady stream of blues.  Sure, you may get twice as much for
killing the red than you would for a blue...  but once you kill the red, you
(and most likely your group) are completely beat up and out of mana, and have
to spend five minutes recovering before taking on the next red / yellow.
Whereas, with the low blue that only gives half as much experience, you put it
down like the dog that it is, go out, grab another and kill that, then do it
again one or two more times before you would have even finished healing up
from the red fight.   50 - 100% more experience, due to the faster kill rate.
