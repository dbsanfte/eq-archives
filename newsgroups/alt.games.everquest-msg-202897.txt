Because they aren't.  Even with all of the improvements to the class
they are poor soloers because:
1) they lack DoTs
2) they lack damage shields
3) they lack snare
4) they lack fear
5) they lack useful nukes
6) they lack invis
7) they are simply unable to damage mobs faster than they are damaged
8) they lack the mana efficient healing that could make up for alot

Sure, a L60 Paladin with substantial AA can wreak havoc on undead, but
he sure as hell doesn't get to that point via solo xping.
Without the substantial AA, and lacking "uber" gear, a Paladin in his
low 50s can xp about one-third as fast as a Druid, if he's willing to
live in LGuk and there isn't too much competition for mobs there.
A Paladin is a very survivable soloer, but he is NOT a very effective
soloer if you measure effectiveness as xp/time.  Rangers and SKs are
much better, and there is no comparison to BLs.
