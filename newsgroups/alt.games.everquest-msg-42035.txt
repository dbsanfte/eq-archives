Here's a trick I used to do with my Druid. Should work better with a Shaman.

Get a pet and buff it (especially offensive buffs).

/pet guard here

pull a hill giant

get it really mad at you. A good nuke followed by chain casting a low level
debuff usually does the trick.

Run back to pet, /pet attack.

Now let the giant follow you around closely and keep it mad so it doesn't
attack your pet (which it will kill fast.) Keep casting that low level (low
level = low mana) debuff.  If it turns on your pet run closer and/or nuke to
get it's attention again. Canibal + Chloro should give you enough mana for
this tactic.
