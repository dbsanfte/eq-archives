Re-read what I wrote -- Simply by the fact it's against the rules, it
affects me. Some snert runs along thinking he's too good to follow the
rules takes a little from my enjoyment. I get some satisfaction in
knowing that the issue is at least reviewed by the ones there to
enforce those rules.

What DOES burn me, though, is to see a lvl 50 or so with an OBVIOUS
violation, and the GM says that he's going to let it slide since the
guy kept it so long. I KNOW this would not be approved of by the GM's
bosses...
