It may not be true any more, but I'm an old-timer.  I seem to remember a
larger number of druids 3 years ago than now.

It may not be true any more again, I've noticed the druids around today
seem to be more togeather than they used to.  Basicly when I grouped
with them they used to do things like AE nuke (while I'm an enchanter
with mezed mobs) and ignore or refuse healing the MT or me, refuse to
cast sow, etc.  or just do other stupid things.

When they used to have new servers without transfers The first to lv 50,
or 60 was always a Druid - I'd say that qualifies as easiest.
