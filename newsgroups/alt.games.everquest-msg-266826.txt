Wow...guess being on one of the RP servers (Anotonia Bayle) on the first
Saturday night after launch is not a good idea. :-)  It was lagging out for
a minute or two at a time on the Isle of Refuge (basically, no commands
would respond, and no new mobs would appear).  When I left the Isle, it
got even worse...add huge graphics lag to the server lag.

How's it doing on the less crowded servers?
