: name.

2 words, 5 syllables (and 1 word even has 4 of them)... I would assume that
he may consider anything over 2 sylables as a big word.

: I might point out that most people don't bother learning the names of
: all the EQ servers, but I'd venture a rough guess and say that 99% of
: them are smart enough to know what server they play on. And they just
: play the game.

What happens if he changes servers by accident?  Does he forget where he was
before?  Does he search through the 34-plus servers tying to find the
characters?  If the character name is over 2 syllables, does he remember how
to spell it or even which character he uses?

So many questions...
