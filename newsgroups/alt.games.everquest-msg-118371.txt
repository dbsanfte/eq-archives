None of the behaviors you listed were anything that I would think humans
would be anymore disuaded from doing through anything other than cultural
influences. But by the same nature, if chimps could develope a language
amongst themselves, I'm sure they'd talk about how those uncivilized humans
go around smiling at each other all day.

I don't "lick my bollocks" in public because I've been programmed by society
not to (oh, and I can't reach).

There have plenty of women recently who have killed there own children for
more no more of a reason than they wanted them out of the way, this is
essentially what a hamster is doing when she eats her young.

Yes, humans act in a way similar to the lions sometimes, fortunately most
societies have developed in such a way to look down upon it (to put it
mildly) but cultures have developed where this is considered a perfectly
legitimate form of advancement (actually similar behavior occurs all the
time in the business world of the USA, what's the first thing a company does
after acquiring another company? LAYOFFS!!).

The dolphin example works against you, it is unfortunate that people behave
in this sort of a manner, however they do.

Something you might be interested in is that the Zoroastrians (I think it's
them, don't quote me) are so strict with their pacifism that they are
forbidden from eating anything that is obtained be killing. So something as
mundane to you as potatos they can't eat because they would have to pull the
plant from the ground to obtain the tuber.
