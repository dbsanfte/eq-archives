What exactly happens on missed notes with a melody?  I've heard several 
different descriptions.

The one I thought was the one in place is that the entire melody starts 
over from song one.

While this would be bad in some circumstances... the only circumstances 
I can think of would be when mezzing, where I wouldn't consider a melody 
anyway, or when fear kiting...

If fear kiting, I'd think keeping it to just fear and snare would take 
care of that problem, miss a note on the snare, start over with fear and 
then move on to snare, which should still be active from last cycle (hmm 
snare fear miss fear snare... yep thats in a four song cycle, if 
barely).  Miss a note on fear and you're even better off as you restart 
fear right away.

On "buff" cycles, having any one drop isn't going to be a big thing in 
most cases, only selos if you are the only move speed increase available 
in a hate kite, or resists if you are in a resists critical situation. 
But in the latter case, you probably aren't bothering with much other 
than the resists, because you already have to cope with missed notes.

On DOT cycles having any one drop isn't big either, just take a bit 
longer for the kill; heck, I usually run a 5 cycle which is really a 4 
and a half cycle because delays cause me to manage true 5 only about 
half the time.  I pull down to 4 (or worst case 3) only if I'm getting a 
lot of resists, because keeping the songs running means that reapplying 
them while they are already on means you get the benefit of the resist 
debuff to restick.

Nope, generally speaking I can't think of a situation where missed notes 
would keep me from using a melody really; I'd only want to go direct 
when things get tricky (ie fun) and I'm switching targets and doing 
several mission critical jobs at once; mez mez charm snare, something 
along those lines.

But perhaps I'm very wrong about how the melody deals with missed notes.
