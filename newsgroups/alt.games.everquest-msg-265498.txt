This is something I have taken issue with for years.  Where in the Christian 
Bible, or in the character of Jesus Christ, do we see greed, conquering, 
murder of a race of people, thievery, rebellion, or any of the things that 
were involved in the founding of this nation?  Jesus said to love your 
neighbor, not lie to him and steal his land.

Sure the founding fathers *claimed* to be Christian, but it seems to me more 
of a mask for conquering a land and making money off of it, rather than any 
sort of moral, "Christian" motivation to me.

Perhaps I'm simply jaded and cynical, I don't know.
