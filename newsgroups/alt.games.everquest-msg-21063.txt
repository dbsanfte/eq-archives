The downside is that instead of playing at off-peak time on a current server
you'd be playing at peak time on a european server which would probably
slow it down more than any network delays.

Also, it's nice to play with people from all over the world. Who would
want to play on a local server anyway?

I don't believe that the server being in the US is the cause of your
problems
anyway. My average latency to the servers is about 300-400 ms, which
causes me no problems whatsoever. If your delay is mugh higher than
that I'd suggest that you probably have some other problem. If you
already have that kind of delay, I doubt you'd notice any differnce
with a local server.
