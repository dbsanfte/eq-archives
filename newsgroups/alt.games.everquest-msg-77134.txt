Yep, Queen is a blast.  Our strategy is to have one cleric healing the 
main tank, all other clerics nuking.  It's the one time the bards load 
Denon's Desperate Dirge, and everyone uses every possible nuke they have.  
Clerics and shaman and enchanters and wizards and mages and necros and 
druids all nuking for all they're worth.  I've seen her drop in about 8 
seconds.  :)
