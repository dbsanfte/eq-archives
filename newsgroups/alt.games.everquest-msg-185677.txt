Not enough to put them into a league of their  own.

Fast xp groups want one slower in pop. And from personal experience when
theres  a shammy its hard to dump that mana.

Dps is reduced when you have a chanter and shammy in the same group. When
you start takin on 500mob hitters, that can make quite a difference to xp
and the clerics mana....  hehe, its still totally viable just slower.
