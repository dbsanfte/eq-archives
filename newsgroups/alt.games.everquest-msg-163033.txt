It does.  Fear is still kept up for emergencies, though.  I went
through the druid/necro routine (well, from a necro standpoint, I'm
not even sure what he's casting besides root when we work together ;p)
in another post, so I won't repeat it.  But you don't need a pet when
you're doubling up, trust me.  It's much more efficient to find a nice
spot in a dungeon and reap the rewards of the bonus exp.
