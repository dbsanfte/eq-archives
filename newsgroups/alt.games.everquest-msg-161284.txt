Beastlord epic seems to be a couple one group camps (the drops do not seem
uncommon, so perhaps camp is the wrong word) of blue to 60 mobs, and 8?
triggered fights that are between 1 and 2 groups in difficulty.   The scouts
needed to trigger the fights seem on a fairly long spawn timer, 3 days to a
week each.   But then theres not all that much competition for them,
compared to other classes.
