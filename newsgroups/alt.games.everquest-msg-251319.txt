I think the copper hammer is desirable because its proc is a high aggro 
one, not because of the actual damage it does.  I could easily be very 
wrong though, my most "melee" character is a cleric.

The fact that YOU are more interested in the stats doesn't mean that 
OTHER people aren't interested in items due to their rarity or their 
color or an interest in misspelled words in the text... what makes one 
person value an item at one price and another at a different one is what 
makes commerce work; the person selling values it at less than the cash, 
and the person buying values it at more than the same cash.

Given more than just two people in the transaction, the final value of 
an item is the... hmm, that oversimplifies things.  Its slightly more 
than the highest value that the person who values it second highest is 
willing to pay.

Reasons don't matter, question is, HOW MUCH?

If I want the item because its copper, and am willing to part with 5kpp, 
but Jim wants it because he collects hammers and is willing to part with 
6kpp, the person selling it feels that because of its stats its worth at 
least 7kpp... well guess what, the seller keeps it because he has no 
buyers at that price.  Add in someone who feels that the proc is 
important to his ability to keep aggro and is willing to pay 8kpp, and 
suddenly the value is something over 7kpp (but under 8kpp, because if 
its priced over that than our tank friend isn't buying)

If SOE controls the price so its fixed at 6kpp, then the person selling 
it may decide to just never sell, since its worth more than that chump 
change to him.
