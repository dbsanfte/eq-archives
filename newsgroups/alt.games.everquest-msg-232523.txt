  Hi everyone, I am presently working on my Ranger epic.  I need help =
obtaining a Jade reaver in City of Mist.  No, I am not about to spend 10 =
to 20k on one since I dont have that kind of plat.  I'm lucky if I get =
1K in the bank at times but when I do it's normally spell buying time =
and that deletes it even more.  So, I am calling on those in Drinal for =
help with my Ranger epic.  All I want is the jade reaver, all loot that =
drops can be for those that help me with this.  If  you have free time =
on your hand and are on the Drinal server, please send me a tell to one =
of my 3 characters.  I'm looking forward to be able to get this soon. =20

  Thank you all in advance
