Is it that low (1200)?  I have seen a big reduction in the damage
I take from low blues and light blues as I got my unbuffed AC up
over 1050 w/o shield (self buffed 1078 or 1110 depending, and
higher still with "real" cleric buffs of course).  Since these mobs
are low blue and light blue to me at 54, I figured that blue to 60
mobs would be a lot tougher, and 60+ raid targets tougher still.

At 60 I suppose you must be right, the lo- to mid-50s I see are not
nearly so tough unless they're seriously twinked.


Hmmm, well I'll have to defer to your first hand experience here,

I'm still just nosing around the very bottom end of where you're
at in the game, and only occasionally at that.  I'd say the best
solution would appear to be something like what Bergh was suggesting,
raise (or even eliminate) the "softcap" on AC effectiveness and
reestablish/reemphasize the AC/HP differential between Warrior,
then Knight (and Monk for AC?), then Ranger/Rogue (and Monk for HP?)
so that Warriors at least remain firmly in the saddle of their pony.
Sounds to me more like the combination of the combat system and the
available gear is broken, than the Warrior class per se.

Kaev <--- wondering if he might just as well stay mid-50s forever
