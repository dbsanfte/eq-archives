I am sorry. When someone like Lokari gets me worked up, I tend to get very
distracted.

Basically true. What you consider private and personal is often mundane to
others.

Kind of why they stopped burying the pharaohs in the pyramids--no security
system will defeat an 'interested' party if they know where to dig. The Valley
of the Kings, on the other hand, used unmarked graves with rock to hide the
loot--much of which has gone undisturbed even in this century.

I don't think the script kiddies are a factor here, nor can be. I am
sure...well, I HOPE that multiple wrong PW attempts will signal to the server
there is a problem that requires a human look-see. Most decent systems have
that built in. A script kiddie might have patience, but the brute force method
will probably bring about a reaction from someone with some kind of authority.
The odds of anyone getting in using brute force, if any kind of security for
wrong attempts is installed, is right around zero.

Of course, your username is sent unencrypted, so maybe we should fear the
script kiddies...

I agree. I firmly advocate self-protection. But part of any self-protection
scheme involves acknowledging that, over the internet, the best you can hope
for is to deter the casual attack. The serious attack will get through, and you
should plan for such.

My UO account name and password is different from my EQ ones and they are
different from my FA ones. When it comes to websites, it goes by how much I
care about the site. If I don't are if my account name and password are posted
to the world, it gets password level 1. (i.e. all sites get the same
password--who has time to remember 50 different passwords for junk sites?) A
little more important gets the second level password, and so on. The highest
level of security is my PGP keys, which are used only for that, and are not
written down anywhere, contain both letters and numbers, and are an acronym of
a phrase I made up.

My voice mail code is NOT my ATM code. The alarm code for work is different
still.

Why all the fuss? Because each and every one of those codes have a slew of
people who could look at them with a few keystrokes, and I can do nothing at
all to prevent it. You can't, I can't, and Lokari can't. We are all subject to
the whims of others when it comes to any security that counts on the actions of
the outside world. My solution is to limit my losses to one area, keep good
records, and be able to prove how much I really had in the checking account. 

Lokari's stance, on the other hand, is to blame you for giving you PIN number
out--even if you didn't--because there is no way that your PIN could have be
gotten unless YOU gave it out to a friend.
