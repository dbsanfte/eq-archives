Tried 6.0 and 7.0.... no go.

Perhaps this could be the cause. It is turned off, but it seems to send me a
whole lotta data (my cablemodem receive light keeps on flashing after I have
been disconnected, and stops about 30-40 secs later). Perhaps something is
messed up...

Any more ideas? should I reload patches or something? How is it done?
