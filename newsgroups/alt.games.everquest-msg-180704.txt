Sorry, don't know of any way to do this and I've often wondered why it was
left out. One possibility  that occured to me is that SOE specifically
disabled it because they didn't want people to start using it as a timer to
regulate in-game events. I have often wanted it around so that I could set a
timer telling me when to return to such-and-such place for the 90-minute
foozle spawn. Just speculation and probably not the real reason, but
something about it feels kind of Verantish to me ...
