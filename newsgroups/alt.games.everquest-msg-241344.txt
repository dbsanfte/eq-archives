Heh, nah, Rumbledor was my first main way back when. Draelen is still 
there on FV, though I haven't played him in quite some time now. I kind 
of ran into a rut with my guild. Didn't seem like anyone was near my 
level anymore, or if they were, they were off doing other stuff usually. 

I took a break for a few months to check out Horizons, but now I'm back 
playing on Saryrn mostly. It was nice to see you had "hit the big time".
