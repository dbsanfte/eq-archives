In response to 6. Sometimes people take serious exception to people telling
them how to play, even when done nice etc. Of course everyone giving advice
"has a 65 alt of class x" etc. so some of those feelings I can understand, I
sure wish that people would give advice constructively, and that people
could take it constructively.
