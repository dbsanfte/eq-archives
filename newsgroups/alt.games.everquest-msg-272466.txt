    Annie, get your list out! Right now, players logging into the Zeks are 
getting a poll on server consolidation. It's coming soon. I called March, 
didn't I?

    But will the game be "dead"? UO is still running, but ask anyone but a 
diehard UO fan and they'll tell you that UO is dead. Is EQ entering a 
UO-like "life support" phase is more the question, not if the plug is going 
to be pulled.

    Loral, something for you to keep an eye on:

    A dev posted his exact XP for a given kill in lower guk, in response to 
player questions about LDoN XP being nerfed. Using the standard XP formula, 
I was able to demonstrate that the ZEM for Lower Guk was 64. When the ShowEQ 
crew first mapped out ZEMs, it was 80 - a 20% reduction. The dev stated that 
LDoN adventures have the same ZEM as Lower Guk. Do you happen to have access 
to the patch message when the expanded group XP bonus was put in game, and 
the date of that change? I'm wondering why they'd reduce the ZEM of Guk by 
20%, and the only thing I can come up with is this was a global nerf at the 
time of the group bonus change. If that is the case, it would have been a 
massive change to the solo player.
