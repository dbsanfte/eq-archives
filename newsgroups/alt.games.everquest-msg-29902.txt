Pets were generating too much aggro.
So much so that if your meleers were smart to make use of the melee
bubble correctly, the mob will beat on the pet and only the pet.

Given that you can have giants in Kael with 30+khps tanking, complete
heal on a pet like that is insanely efficient.  AoW generates just far
to much damage too fast for any player character to ever hope to tank
him long enough for a battery of clerics to bathe them in complete
heals.

A 30khps pet however, can.

Unfortunately, you can also use the same 30khps pet against Tormax
making him damn near trivial with just 4 groups.
