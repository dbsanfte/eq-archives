Hello,

If you want to move the windows you will have been clicking on the top left
"box" at the corner of each window then moving the pointer. There is another
similar box at the bottom right of all the windows. If you do the same thing
( click and then move from memory ) the window will resize with your
pointer. Click again to finish the resize.

Hope this helps!
