Has anyone tried to pull past the doors in Paw since the last pathing
'fix'? Groups never went past the doors because unless you knew
exactly how to pull it, it was impossible to get in w/o getting a
major train.

/salute to any group that actually heads down there for exp.

there for you to hunt in undisturbed. Especially for people that don't
mind getting a bit less exp in exchange for dungeons where the good
loot drops.
