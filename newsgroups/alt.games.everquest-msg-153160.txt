Oh, absolutely.  And the new Chardok was done really well in that regard.  I
like the tunnels with a new set of mobs every few feet.  Just fighting your
way in you get exp.

That still amazes me.  People seem to think that Chardok is just the zone
in, zone out and fort camps.  Almost nobody goes in any deeper, which is a
real shame.  The exp is so much better deeper in.
