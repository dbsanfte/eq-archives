: Comments like that are all too often now days in EQ.

Huh? how should that have been punctuated?  It seems to be a sentence
fragment.  Did you mean to type "Comments like that are much too prevelant
in EQ, these days"?  Or was it something else?  Don't strain your glutes
trying to work it out.

: When people in my
: Guild started retiring and I had to find groups I could see that the
: intelligence level of the average player has really sank from what it used
: to be.

Based on your writing style, I'd have to say that it may be that you have
trouble understanding what is said around you.  That could account for your
perception that the intelligence level of EQ seems to have dropped (notice
the 2 'p's).  In reality, the intelligence level has gone up (it had not
sunk, as you claimed [note the 'had' with 'sunk', not 'has sank') and you
were not comprehending as much.
