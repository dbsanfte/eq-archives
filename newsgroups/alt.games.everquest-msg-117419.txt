Ah, then I take it that you "just hate" the collective membership of
most/all of the guilds who have awakened the Sleeper?  Or are you
suggesting that they didn't first pharm the snot out of the warders in
order to outfit their melees with primal weapons?  Especially in cases
like this one, where there was (apparently) an agreement amongst the ST
capable guilds to not wake the Sleeper so that all could pharm in turn?
Everybody detests ninja looters, because not only do they deny items to
others but they show themselves to be without honor.  How then does it
differ to wake the Sleeper in violation of an agreement, denying primal
weapons (and gnome masks :p) to scores or even hundreds of characters
(the game and our time in it are finite, reducing the drop rate quite
effectively denies the item(s) to many who would otherwise have been
able to get them), quite effectively showing the offending guild to be
a collention of spiteful loot-whores without honor.

Still, one can hope that the other parties to the now defunct agreement
will take the trouble to make virtual life difficult for the offenders,
as has been suggested elsewhere in this thread.  Perhaps then one or two
of them might learn a valuable life-lesson:  When you make a habit of
going about waving your dick in the face of others you become rather
vulnerable to having it cut off.
