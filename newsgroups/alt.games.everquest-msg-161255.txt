I am.

Two things to try:

1.  Adding all the PoP zones may have reduced your free disk space
(and thus your max virtual memory) to critical low levels.  Make
sure you have at least 250MB free on your disk before you try to
run EQ -- preferably even more.

2.  Create a file in your EQ directory named "nosound.txt".
Then run EQ.  If this fixes your problem, your sound card or
driver has some incompatibility with it.  You'll get no sound
but at least you can run until you iron out the issue (by
upgrading your drivers or whatever).

The sound engine upgrade that was released with PoP caused
a lot of people's sound drivers to barf, kicking them out of
the game.
