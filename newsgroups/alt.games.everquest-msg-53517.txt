No.

Only Sullon Zek is (partially) about that. In every other server there are 
very specific restrictions on player behaviour, for the benefit of the 
community as a whole. I don't see why GM events should be different. If 
someone doesn't want to join in and play by the rules, they should just 
ignore the event and go somewhere else...
