MT means Main Tank (as I have come to understand it), but Main Taunter, I
suppose, would fit as well as the one doing the taunting is going to end
up being the Main Tank.  Its always really good to have on person who acts
as the Main Tank, normally a warrior, as they have the most HP and AC
(generally).  Their job is to mash the taunt button until it bleeds to
keep the aggro on themselves at all times.
