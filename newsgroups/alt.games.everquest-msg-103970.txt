I've said the same thing myself to people who've sent me tells
asking for a rez and happened to be near my bind point.  If
you're expecting a rez you don't want to be putzing around
with either your spellbook or your inventory.   Both cause the
rez confirmation box to be missed and, in my experience, bug
you so that you have to log or zone to get the rez.  Neither
option is desirable, especially for a cleric that has to get back,
loot their corpse, get mana, rebuff, and get mana again before
the raid can continue.

Sure, they *may* have just killed the AoW and are waiting for
loot to be distributed or they may be waiting for a camped
cleric to log back in, etc.  But it's just as possible that they're
expecting a rez as soon as the epic cleric targets their corpse
and casts and aren't going to take a chance on missing it...
