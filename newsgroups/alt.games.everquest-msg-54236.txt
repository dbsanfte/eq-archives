You know, you and fucking Biz amaze me on this one. Are you *really*
going to sit there and say that Mesmer is equally (or even within a
1/1000 margin) as well known as fucking Freud?  Come on guys. Get over
the egos and dickwaving. This is a lost cause. Mesmer would be known to
a small subset. Freud could be quoted by most garden radishes.
