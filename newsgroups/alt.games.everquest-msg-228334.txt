Hi There Again

Here's another story from the SOE site. As a Halfling I have to agree 
with the closing statement <grin>

Time for a Change

I was hired as Community Relations Manager for EverQuest just over three 
years ago, in October of 2000.  I have to admit that the last three 
years have been the most entertaining three years of work I've ever had. 
I've had a great time getting to know the EverQuest community.  It's 
been a great pleasure to meet many of you at Fan Faire, through email, 
and on message boards.  Your enthusiasm for EverQuest is outstanding, 
and I appreciate everything that enthusiasm means.

Some folks have claimed that being Community Relations Manager for a 
huge product like EverQuest is a thankless job, and one that they 
wouldn't wish on their worst enemy.  I disagree.  I still have some 
great emails and letters that customers have sent to us, thanking us for 
the fun they've had in EverQuest.  I've had one on display in my office 
for over a year, and I'm very proud of each of them.

I've enjoyed every minute that I've had this job.  I want to thank you 
all for playing the game and for engaging me every day.  I appreciate 
that you take us to task when we're wrong and that you appreciate the 
things we do well.  Thanks.

I also wanted to thank the EverQuest Live team, past and present.  I've 
had the honor of working with some of the best in the business.  Thanks.

But I'm only praising the EQLive team because I have to.  It's just 
practical to butter them up, since I'm to be one of them now.  :)  The 
folks here at SOE have offered me a chance to be a game designer, and 
I'm going to give it a try.  It's one of those undeniably exciting 
things, to tell people that you make games for a living.  I'm incredibly 
pleased to be given this opportunity.

So my official title is now Game Designer, and you'll probably be 
hearing a lot less from me in the future.  With my well-honed Community 
Management skills, I can guess your next question:  "Who will be taking 
your place?"

We've been lucky in that regard.  We managed to snag one of the 
hardest-working, most experienced and silliest people in the company. 
Alan Crosby, also known as Brenlo Bixiebopper, is the new Community 
Relations Manager for EverQuest.  Not only is he a great guy, but he has 
a great name (the Alan part, not the Bixiebopper part).  Also, in the 
odd tradition of EQ Community Relations Managers, he also has a nice 
alpha-loot handle.

Enough from me.  I now yield the floor to Alan so he can introduce 
himself.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

Well thanks for the kind words Alan; you never say anything that nice to 
me in person!

I know that Alan (the other Alan) will be greatly missed and I can never 
hope to fill his shoes.  He has a wry sense of humor and a comfortable 
writing style that many of you have enjoyed for some time now. Thanks 
for all you have done Alan, and I know you will be successful adding new 
content to the game you have been so deeply involved with for the last 3 
years.

So a little about me.  My title for nearly the last 2 years has been 
Customer Service Manager for our EQ games.  Prior to that I was a Lead 
Game Master, a Game Master and at one point long ago, a Guide and Senior 
Guide.  I have been playing EQ since it released, and involved with its 
community since shortly thereafter.  I have met many of you at Fan 
Faires and through correspondence, and I look forward to getting to know 
many more of you in the weeks and months ahead.

So change has brought me here to share time with you, the EverQuest 
Community.  I feel that the greatest reason EQ has been so successful 
for so long is because of you and your passion for this game.  I 
encourage you to continue to share your passion with me, in constructive 
ways, and I will bring your thoughts, feelings and concerns to the 
EQLive team.  I guarantee that you will be heard. Please remember that 
we all have our own ideas of how the game should be and they may not all 
be implemented or even considered (I for one feel that Halflings should 
rule Norrath, for some reason the Dev team is not with me on this).

Thanks for your time and thanks for being a part of Norrath!
