Yes, never had a problem with my MoB attacking somebody else while
kiting in 49 levels. Definitely being done on purpose or they just
don't care.

As for quad kiting; are these MoB high green to the kiter? I find two
blues a handful. The only quad-kiting I saw was at the HG hill in
rathe mountain and he was level 55 getting no exp and just farming the
plat at the expense of those who were hunting in level. That's rude in
general and why we end up with dungeons like the warrens.
