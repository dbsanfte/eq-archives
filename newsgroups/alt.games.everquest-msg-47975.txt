At 25, assuming you're not a rich twink (and from your current armor,
I'm concluding you're not) then fine steel plate armor is just fine for
your level. Keep your eyes open when going through the auction zones
(assuming you have a little plat saved up by now.) You may find some
deals. Can Pallies wear Ry'Gorr? Never noticed. Some nice pieces drop in
Unrest (example is the Blood Stained Mantle, but again, not sure if
Pally usable) so you may want to try there. But otherwise, save up your
plat and get a full set of FS. Pretty good at 25 and don't pay attention
to the twinks. I was still primarily in bronze at your level, and had
only just started collecting my first couple pieces of crafted. (Not an
option for you, sadly. Great armor, but warrior only.)
