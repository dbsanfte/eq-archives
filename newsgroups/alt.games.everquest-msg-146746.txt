i do some soloing while waiting for grps in and around kc, what will have
the better DPS, 1 hander or 2, and when i am in a grp but there is another
warrior who is pulling or MA, should i use 2 handers then?  i just got a
stormwood battle staff and it seems to me to do more dps then my centis, and
i only have 2hb up to 150, i think at 210 or whatever it maxes at will do a
lot more dmg.
hope what i wrote makes sence, i am half awake, lol
thanks
