There is the basic assumption that if "I" know something, then anyone that
doesn't know it is an idiot.  Of course, there is also the foolish notion
the some significant portion of the people that play EQ spend time on this
site.  I'd be interested to know the number of people that actually use this
site.  Compare that to 450,000 accounts, and I suspect that the percentage
is very small.  It should also be noted that the players here are,
relatively speaking, sophisticated in their play, relative to the common
population.  That is a generality.  I know I certainly do not fit that mold
as I just don't play that often.  My wizard has about 5 days of play time in
over two years.  Of course, for over a year, I didn't play at all.

There's a lot to be gained from the more experienced players, but you have
to be willing to sift through a bunch of vapid arguments in order to scrape
together a few gems of information.

Cheers,
Eric
