This will probably happen on all servers at some time in the next few days
on each.  If you missed it, about one or two weeks ago, every server had an
event where Firiona Vie was in Greater Faydark.  Needless to say, this
attracted a lot of attention.  She then went to Felwithe, nearly crashing
both gfaydark and felwithe as over 50 people all tried to zone at the same
time =)  Anyway, Firiona went to her father, the King whatever of Felwithe,
and they were saying something about a mission to stop the forces of evil or
something like that, I don't remember exactly, I have a log from the one on
E'Ci if you want it. This event was more than likely related to the same
story line so I'd imagine it will take place on all.
