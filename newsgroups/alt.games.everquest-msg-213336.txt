One or two patches ago, they also corrected two things
in NK that were actually kind of amusing. One was that
every time Zahal the Vile was killed, another Regis the
Reverent was spawned, even if one already existed. It
gave you the chance to kill multiple Regises. (A guild
friend and I killed 14 of them one night. :) ) Now, alas,
there is only one Regis, no matter how many Zahals you
kill. Another was the Ezmirella, the gypsy woman, was
'trapping' willowisps. I saw them once, when I had camped
in the gypsy camp. When I logged back in, for just a
second, there was this mass of little blue twinkling
lights where Ezmirella stands. It was weird to stand
next to her when she was trapping them. There was this
fairly loud buzzing, like a pissed-off hive of bees.
And tracking was funny, too. You would see this:
