I would guess that the resources available for online games will be 
quite widely distributed across different wealth categories.  There are 
very few super-rich individuals as a proportion of the population.

Just as there are more ordinary stores than luxury-good stores, there 
will surely be more games for people of ordinary means than for those 
willing to pay a lot.
