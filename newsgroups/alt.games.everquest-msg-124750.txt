Naw, wimpy field.  I can't remember an exact number, but it wasn't enough 
to screw up the hypersensitive PDP 8 sitting next to the 'scope. :)  
Pretty sure it was an electric field under 20 volts... So as long as you 
don't move those magnets really really fast, it should be comparable. :)

Ok, the really funny part of this story:  The entire experimental setup 
was housed in a walk-in refigerator kept at 2 deg. Celsius.  So I'd take a 
thermos of coffee and a thick coat in for my 4 hour session... After a few 
of these sessions, it occurred to me that I really had absolutely no idea 
why I was sitting here freezing my butt off... temperature control didn't 
seem like it was the least bit important to the experiment.

So I tracked down the professor and asked him why the hell I was sitting 
in a refrigerator... "Oh, well, we have to keep it in the refrigerator, or 
the computer's video card will overheat."

Aigh.
