We could get it on the next patch: there's a trivial way to implement
it with changes to the client that would take about 10 minutes to
program, and need *no* changes to the server.  It would not be ideal
(it would use as much bandwidth as using /ooc and /shout do now...to
make a raid channel that saves bandwidth does require server changes),
but would at least make multigroup raids in areas where there are
other people not on the raid a lot less annoying.  This has been
suggested to Verant, with details, be a few people, but no response.
