Yep yep, that crack is so wide and so easy to cross that I
personally can't see using it as a 'sploit, although some
have said it is.

My Vah Shir bard CAN fit thru the crack, and I once ran a
level 1 barbarian over to do the same thing just to prove
to a 54 barbie warrior that it was possible.  Haven't
had occaision to squeeze an unaltered ogre or troll thru,
but thats the only races I can think of that I'll still give
benefit of  the doubt to on the squeezing thing, your wolf
form idea would take care of even that.

Didn't really think about the druid being there in terms
of buying and selling, of course he can port the group
to Grimling Forest, for the fastest possible bank/vendor
access in the game.
