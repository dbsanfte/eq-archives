Um, 2k is not cheap to some of us.  I do check out the bazaar, but, I
tradeskill a fair amount, and have a lot of expensive spells coming up, so I
don't really have any significant amounts of cash to spend.  There is a
tailor in guild who is attempting to make me some arctic wyvern pieces, but,
his success rate is still around 25%.  I need to get him some more velium, I
gave him a bunch of hides already, and the cod oil.  The good thing is that
means I get the pieces essentially for free, as he gets to skillup on making
them, and I provide the raw materials.  Also going to get him to make one or
two Acrylia studded pieces, as they are higher wisdom than the comparable
wyvern pieces.
