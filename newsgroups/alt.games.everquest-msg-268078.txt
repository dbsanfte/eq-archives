It seems to be a matter of nodes, for the most part.   The nodes appear to be
random, with an equal chance of each item coming up (with one exception).

Roots, herbs and good all use gathering, so theres a 37.5% chance a node will
spawn that can raise that skill.   (then adjust upwards because of the lower
demand for garden / herb nodes)
Metal nodes and gem nodes both use mining, so thats a 25% chance of raising
mining.
Foresting only raises from wood nodes, so 12.5%
Trapping only raises from den nodes, so 12.5% again.

Thats about the difficulty order in raising them as well.

Fishing is the one excpetion.  It's an exception because the nodes are
concentrated geographicly in whatever water the zone has, and because there is
super low demand, meaning they build up *tons* of fish nodes easily, which
other crafters compete for a shrinking number of wood / ore / gems.    So even
though it's only a 12.5% chance to come up on the spawner, it's the easiest
skill to raise.   Just go to the pond and by the time you clear out the
backlog, your skill is going to be maxed.  (1)

(1)  As a side note, it really sucks how many resource nodes in Antonica must
be being eaten up by the fish spawn.   Just swim along the coast by Qeynos for
a bit if you want to see what I mean.   The fish nodes will be stacked 4 deep
on top of each other for the entire length of the shore.  It gets a triple
whammy for suckiness, because 1) It is annoying to gather from that deep
underwater.  You can't reach them from the shore, so you have to keep diving
and resurfacing for breath.  2) Not everyone raised fishing to be able to
clear it.  3) It's geographicly about 10 mins of solid running away from the
other "main resource" areas.  It's so far that it's not really feasible to run
over and take a fishing break to speed up the normal spawn.
