Then just maybe you should post stuff like "yeah, I felt
horrible....*every* time I did it over and over again"
Hypocrite.

So's using exploits, but you didn't seem to have a problem with that.

Anymore.

Explain to me how the hell you're learning how to play with KEI and a
Virtue and a Fungi? F'n twink. It's people like you that DON'T know
how to play their class and get groups killed. The other person was
right, you should have just bought a character. It's exactly the same
thing. What's the difference between asking a friend to cast on you,
or a stranger to cast KEI on you, which is an obvious bug that you can
get it at all. Thank God they're fixing that. Oh damn, people might
have to learn how to manage their mana now. Or God forbid, we might
have to hold pulls for a second to let someone med.

HAHAHAHA. Again. I felt bad "all the times I did it". Lovely.

You need a reality check. Poor people buy food with their money
instead of EQ. This game is a luxury. No one who plays it is "poor".

Yeah yeah. Hitler probably said the same thing. So do television
evangelists the day before they build a theme park or get caught with
a hooker. Poliricians say the same thing as they're pickpocketing you
while kissing your baby.
