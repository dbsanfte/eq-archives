A barehanded Monk will always be effective, however for most of his or
her life, weapons will have better damage output. At the highest
levels, I think I heard 57-60, barehanded out damages any weapons in
the game currently. Check out
http://www.geocities.com/copelandeq/meleestats.html For Copland's
weapon analyzer, you can put your level and strength into the program,
then pick fist or weapon to compare outputs at your level. For
instance, a level 9 Monk with 100 STR, does 72 DPM. while a Fighting
Baton (8 20) does 198 DPM, a fist doesn't do this much damage until
level 34 (201 DPM). Obviously, 1hb is much better though the middle
levels. This is a valuable weapon, one of the best in the game for a
Monk, and you probably won't be able to afford one for some time, so
it really isn't an fair comparison. You can use a  Cracked Staff (5
32) to practice your skill. It does 84 DPM, making it better than your
fists at level 9. Since you have dual wield, you could use a cracked
staff and a bare hand, then just keep whichever has the lower skill in
your main hand then switch to keep both maxed.
