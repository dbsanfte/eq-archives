I haven't bought anything in the bazaar with my latest round of 
characters, and at 50th they are hunting in Karnors, Kael, and other 
zones and my SK is wearing ldon augmented Darkforge (SolRo armour 
obtained in early 40s), and drops from LDoN named, all of which they 
looted. And you can't argue that my group is 'carrying me'... as in my 
regular group -all- of us are playing like this, and I'm the MT. 

If its not appropriate to engage said mob with this stuff then someone 
should tell the mobs because they keep on dying against our 'crap gear'.
