I've fought in MS with lowbies a few times, but...
- The zone is really ugly
- Lightcrawler adds are death for the poorly geared soloer
- The zone may be the ugliest in the entire game world (I haven't
actually seen every zone, so it's possible there's an uglier one)
- Some really stupid people hunt there, most of them want to group
with you, many of them will train you (probably by accident) whether
or not you group with them.
- I (mostly) hate hunting in Luclin, especially outdoor zones there
- Did I mention that the zone is so ugly it makes my teeth itch?
