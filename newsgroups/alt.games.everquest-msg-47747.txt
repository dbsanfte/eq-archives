You may be able to find something on ebay as well, assuming you don't have
any RL friends around you that play.

Though as one fellow pointed out.. we hope you have a cable modem.. or,
well...

Install
Run
Go out to breakfast, lunch and dinner
Come back home and hope its done
Play EQ (finally at 3am in the morning)

<grin> ;p
