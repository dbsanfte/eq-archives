Actualy, the difference between a direct tell and /ooc is the color of 
text that it pops up in on their screen.  And whether it also pops up on 
the screens of a bunch of people you've already determined can't help you, 
due to their race or class.

They don't have to answer it in either case.  And if they feel obligated 
to answer, 'r no<CR>' is 5 keystrokes.  Even if you type only 10 words a 
minute, that's 6 seconds.

And sure, it's possible they'll then say 'aww PLZZZZ!' in which case, they 
have revealed themseves as someone truly worthy of /ignore, which can only 
to be to your advantage.  It is also possible they wil say 'oh ok, thank 
you for your time.'  I have to say, I see the latter case much more often.
