As if his load of bullshit was even true. Going out on a limb and
saying it really was his child posting, she's a damn good little
actress to get daddy so worked up. I'd go as far as to say this isn't
the first time she's pulled the wool over his eyes so completely and
gotten him to bail her out of shit, and that this isn't by far the
worst of it.

He's in for a shock when his little angel turns up pregnant and/or
fails a drug screening in a couple years...
