That's probably true, but at least with the various varieties
of skeletons, proximity clearly is a greater than usual taunt 
factor. I've seen it over and over: a snared skeleton being
pulled back to a group will turn from the puller onto anyone
else standing too close, even before they hit it.

This may well be specific to skeletons since I can't say that
I've noticed the same thing with other undead e.g. ghoul frogs
in Lguk.

Newbie Barbarians learn quickly to get far away when someone
is training the vengeful {composer|lyricist|soloist} by, 
because it *will* stop and turn on you if you're too close 
to it's path.
