Subject: I still only have the original EQ

I've been playing on and off for almost two years and still have only the
original EQ.  Can anyone recap the expansions up til this point and tell me
what each added.  I think I'll be going to purchase the first expansion shortly
as I feel that I'd like to have some new lands to explore.  Obviously, I'm a
pretty casual gamer and my main is only a level 30.  There are still a lot of
places I haven't explored in the original, which is why I never bothered to buy
the expansion.  Thanks for any info.
