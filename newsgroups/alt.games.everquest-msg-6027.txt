Someone's already answered that question. I thought it was Intelligence, Dex
makes sense as well.

500 is actually about right, it is a good buy, make no mistake but you'll
have trouble selling one for 1k let alone 2.5k.
I'd suggest using something quicker to help your skill, I used a Stilleto of
Bloodclaw that I picked up for 60pp (norm is about 100 now) 6/23 with a 20
pnt proc and 30pnt dot. The speed helped my skill no end...It's now 125 (max
is 130) and I can hit for 40 dam a time with the Spear.
