Actually, according to the class action suit, what they were doing was
pre-cooking them to 90% done in beef tallow (thereby adding "natural
flavouring"), then freezing them and shipping them to the restaurants, where
they'd be finished in vegetable oil (canola, I believe).

The only thing I like out of BK is the fish burgers.  Those are excellent
(except for the massive quantity of mayo they sometimes dump on them).

Best fries for me are from Joey's Seafood.

Me, I'm a happy omnivore.  What's life without pasta and meatballs in a
thick tomato sauce, generously sprinkled with shredded cheddar?  (And
because I like 'em, and I cook for me, I add anchovy paste to the sauce for
a bit of extra kick.)
