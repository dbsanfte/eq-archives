Weapons have a damage and delay. Higher damage=good. Lower delay=good. 
Divide damage by delay for relative power (at your level).
Armor has an armor class value. Higher=better.

For some quick cash, Id run the bard quest. Go talk to ton twostring in the 
freeport bard guild. (north freeport western end).
Rune the mail back and forth from freeport to kelethin.
Make some money, then go to the bazaar.
Flotsam is a good cheap weapon (if your class can wield it). Type /bazaar 
and do a search.

To get to the bazaar, take the POK book (look at your map with backspace). 
Then take the nexus stone (north part of east section), then bazaar is south 
exit.
