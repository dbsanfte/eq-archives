Yes I understand your question, and yes that is possible. I think that at
level 11 you start to lose experience when you die, but before that it is
possible to travel via the "poor mans gate" without experience loss.  At
level 11 you still might want to put stuff in the bank before making a long
run. It will save you a corpse run if you get killed along the way.
