It doesn't seem like I had received the original post. But I am going to
comment on it anyways.

1. If he is sent this mythical "no-pay crack" he would still have to buy the
CDs. What kind of person can afford a computer capable of playing EQ, the EQ
game itself then can't afford the $10/month to play it? I mean when I was 13
(back in the 80's) my allowance was $10/week!

2. And he wants the whole game sent to him ... to a Hotmail address... which
has a file size restriction of around 2Mb ... I mean EQ on my comp is almost
a gig. Sigh .. I bet this guy wouldn't even know what to do with the file if
it ever got sent to him!
