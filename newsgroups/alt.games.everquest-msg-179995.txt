The SEoC *used* to be a guaranteed drop from Inny.  Then they added it
to the loot tables of all the boss mobs, but then made it a random
drop off Inny.  Now, if adding to the boss mobs' loot table was done
to make it a *bit* easier to get, for folks who maybe weren't in a
guild strong enough to allow them to tackle Inny, what was the point
of then taking away the guaranteed drop?  In the end, the stupid gem
is just as hard (if not *harder*) to get now.  I too was on a Hate
raid recently (following a server reset, so all boss mobs plus Inny
were up = 12 shots at the SEoC) and, you guessed it, nothing.  Of
course my guild *also* stopped right on Inny's door step, with a
majority leaving because it was getting OH SO LATE.....late like 2:30
am est on a frickin' FRIDAY...so we ended up not killing him...agh,
must stop now....
