There is no such thing as a true newbie anymore. My friend never
played a MMORPG before. Total newbie. I gave him a couple medium level
items just to start him off, he's not super twinked but has a vellium
staff for example. So he starts a new character without my help and
within 1 day of playing has gotten more free gifts from strangers then
the "twinked" one from me. People were falling all over themselves to
help both his new characters, including telling him where to hunt,
giving him stuff and even power leveling him. 

This game requires communication and when someone enters a
conversation and asks "What is SoW?" everyone else knows they are a
newbie, half of them have high level characters and someone will twink
them. The number of true untwinked newbies in this game on all servers
is under a hundred I would bet, and for their sakes (or could it be to
get people to replay more characters?) Verant is willing to make
quests and give rewards  that players who have been supporting Verant
for 2.5 years can't do. Their class can do it but they can never
complete them.
