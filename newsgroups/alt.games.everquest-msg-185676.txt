Hi all,

	Thinking of starting up a second character (haven't been playing
long) and was going to go with a Palidin (1st one now a level 20
mage).

	What race would people recommend for the Paladin.  I was thinking
of going with a half elf.  Wanted human but was worried about the lack
of night vision.

	Any help greatly appreciated.

Regards,

Wayne...
