Since you're depending on pet/ds for damage why not just keep your
Enchanter runed to give yourself a safety margin?  You'll still
be "switching between windows in a worry", but you can do it less
frequently knowing that you have more time before you become a
stain on the landscape.  You could also pick up a little more
margin by cadging a long duration HP buff off a Paladin.  Seems
like you'd get xp so much faster that the small risk of an
occasional death shouldn't be a big deal.
