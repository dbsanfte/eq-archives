Those who rabidly hate PvP completely are rare. Don't confuse PvP with
PK, though. There's a difference. PvP is a fair fight between two
players that both pose a challenge to the other. PKers are those who
just senselessly slaughter anyone, even those that are so far below
their level/skill that they pose no challenge. They also kill for no
reason more than to piss people off, certainly not for the challenge.

I'll go on to add one thing: Turning in the PvP book on a non-Zek
server is only shooting yourself in the foot. YOu gain absolutely
nothing beyond the ability to attack the 1% of the players on the
server who've also turned in their books. On the other hand, you can
no longer be healed, buffed, or teleported by the 99% of non-PvP
characters on the server. If you want PvP, it's best to just play on
one of the Zek servers. Be prepared to deal with more immature
griefers and whiners than on the "blue" servers.
