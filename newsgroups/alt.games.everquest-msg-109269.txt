That is because your gnome necro, for whatever reason, has good enough
"Commons residents" factions but you've not bothered to raise the
"coalition of tradesfolk" freeport merchant faction that the center
innkeeper is on. You need to do the jenam and rebby quests in freeport
East to west which raises both tradesfolk factions. You can do the two
at once which raises that faction pretty fast.
