Does anyone know a way to generate the character 0x12 (hex), 18 (decimal) in
Notepad? It is a non-printing character which, when in Notepad displays as a
little box. I can open a Notepad file with the character in it and see the
box, but I cannot figure out how to actually generate that character from
Notepad.

Thanks!
