Hehe.... I was playing my Beastlord in GR in highhold and saw I cleric
do the same thing. He went DL and then started tanking goblin like a
mad man.  It was hilarious!!

I have been playing for almost 3 years that is the FIRST time I saw
anyone FIGHTING while DL.
Plus I learned that a DL character will also cast spells too.. never
knew that.. thought they would just swing whatever weapon your
holding.

It is prolly random cast of whatever you have mem'd..
So clerics.... make sure you have Divine Aura mem'd... hehe
might get lucky and it might get casted
