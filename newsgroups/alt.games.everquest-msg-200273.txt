First off thanks for the input, generally i've avoided CRPG's as they
don't add up to the Pen & Paper variety. Thank you for understanding
that this game can and is frustrating and when people get frustrated
they complain. The first char i ever had was a dwarf on Maelin
Starpyre and when the game finished loading (got into the game world)
i was greeted with a bunch of windows and a yellow screen my first
question was "i wonder if there are display issues with my grafics
card" (not that you care ;-) ) What i find continueally amazing is the
complete and utter lack of newbie friendliness the game exibits. I've
never played a game so unfriendly before.

However i can understand where the flamers are coming from, and will
frequent this newsgroup for a couple of days apologizing to everyone
i've angered as chances are i will come here for help later on my EQ
playing carreer and don't wish to be greeted by flames whenever i ask
for help (it won't be in the form of a rant next time)

Thanks for you understanding
