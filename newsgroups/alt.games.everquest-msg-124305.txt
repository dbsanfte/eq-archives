Slay undead 3 is fierce. I know a paladin with 140 AAXP solely
from soloing the *entire* karnors basement (all floors) without
break, keeping them all clear as they repop, including breaking
the spawns when he arrives.

Its ludicrous against undead.... "Heebee hits a skeletal scryer
for 6409 points of damage"

Blech! ;)

(ListenSui, stop complaining, the reward I get for 60 levels of
hell and taunting is that I'm allowed, once in a while, to let
all that accumulated rage loose and go ABSOLUTELY APE SHIT on
an undead scapegoat, ok?!)
