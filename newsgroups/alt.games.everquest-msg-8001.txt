My Bard twink was in there at level 3 to get the mask.  Wasn't hard at all,
just got an IU from a Pally at zone, and theer was a group killing bats, so
they weren't a problem, and I ran to the room, stood in the corner next to
the cleric, and the mask dropped, I looted it, got an IU form the friendly
cleric, and was on my way.
