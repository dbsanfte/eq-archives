Nope. It encourages this thing called "strategy". You should try it

Nope. You screw up, it's your own damn fault, wait for the timeout.

Get to level 35. Until then, suffer.

I mean, really...When meditating, you're supposedly focused on the
runes in your book until you reach a level of power where you can

are not going to be very aware of what's going on around you... Visual
obstruction is about right for it.
