Actually, it's not really optimal.  If you log the actual access
sequences of most programs and use that to derive an optimal disk
layout, you'll find that the optimal pattern requires dozens of files
to be interleaved on the disk for a given program.  If you do that,
however, you then find when you start defrag, it takes it around 30
minutes to become responsive, because your disk is *extremely*
fragmented, and it apparently uses some algorithms whose time
complexity is a function of the fragmentation level.
