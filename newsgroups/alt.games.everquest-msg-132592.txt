}> If I am thinking clearly and remembering properly (neither of which is

}new spawns are at the top of the list.  otherwise it's all right ;)

Hmm, the two times I've been in SRo playing a druid when the AC has 
spawned, he was about 7/8 of the way down the list.  I was killing stuff 
fast enough that I'm not suprised he wasn't all the way down, but he 
certainly wasn't near the top.

I also noticed that certain things I never killed (like those merchants 
and Andad Filla) never really made it to one end or the other, they just 
floated around the middle.
