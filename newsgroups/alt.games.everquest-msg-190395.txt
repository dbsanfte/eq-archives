Waaaay back when, this was a bit of an exploit. Once drunk wore off,
your mana pool stayed at full. It was quite common to see a swaying
caster sitting somewhere, and Master Drunkards were very common too.

This was post-beta, but I don't think it lasted much after that. I
think they fixed it just a bit before nerfing the Tumpy Tonic quest.
That far back and events kinda blur together.
