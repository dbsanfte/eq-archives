Maybe, if that's how your guild works. Giving the level 60 MT the BP
is going to do more good for the guild than a 52 cleric. If your guild
operates by "How will this most benefit the guild?" then the MT is
going to get an upgrade.

All guilds have to have a set of priorities. Having the officers
decide who should receive a drop seems more fair to me than
/random'ing.
