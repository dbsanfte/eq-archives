He did say "in the same zone or close".  Heck, I've offered to cross zone 
lines for a few lower-level guildies that I knew were fighting next door, 
just to cast SoW and a couple buffs.  Why not?  A guild is like a large, 
permanent group.  If you're not there to contribute your talents - what 
*are* you there for?

(Note - I'm not saying that if you're on the other side of the world 
you're automatically expected to drop everything and run for them - but 
if you're *not* busy, what's the big deal?)
