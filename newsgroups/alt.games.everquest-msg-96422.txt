There are 2 Werewolves in WK, one is 25th, he spawns everynight, another is
high teens (think I tried to to take him at 17 and he was white then, I
failed) and possibly spawns as high as 20. Whether or not the second, lesser
spawns every night and just gets killed I don't know, the 25th level one
aggro's everything so often dies if he crosses Treants, GM or  the Cyclops'
path (and now a high 40's necro NPC as well) otherwise he will normally kill
and clear bandit camps, seems to follow the bandit pathing to other camps.

You should be able to take the lesser one but the 25th level one will eat
you alive, if you want him, follow him  to a bandit camp and keep an eye on
him, they will weaken him, especially Brigands so you may stand a chance
after he has killed all of them.

The werewolf does not despawn from what I have seen, he spawns at 8pm and
runs havoc until killed, luckily he normally crosses the path of some NPC
that will hand his arse to him, during the day.
