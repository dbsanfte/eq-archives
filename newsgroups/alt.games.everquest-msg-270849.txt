There were Torigans Mines, Dulak Caves, Old Sebilis, Howling Stones, 
Chardok, Nurga, SolB Giants, The Grey, Greigs End, Kedge Keep, Karnor's 
Castle, Acrylia Caverns, The Hole, Natimbi.. and I haven't even 
mentioned a Velious zone yet...and there are half a dozen there... the 
list of good zones at 50-60 is huge...

Complaining about the 50s because you sat at the entrance to PoP is 
ridiculous. Its like spending your 40s at the entrance to Karnor's 
castle, the 30s at the entrance to City of Mist, etc...

You can spend all your time in the game playing at the entrance to a 
zone higher level than you... or you can play the whole game deep in 
level appropriate zones doing challenging and interesting things.

It sounds like you really missed out on the 50s.

There was much to do in the 50s too... but it looks like you got hung up 
on getting to the 60s instead of enjoying what there was that you could 
do in the 50s.
