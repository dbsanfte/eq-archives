  I think I'm capable of coming up with my own opinion, thanks.

  Ambushing and using superior numbers to your advantage is a valid tactic.
Cheating, of course, is not, but if the staff of the game is on top of the
ball, and the mechanics of the game are solid, it's not a big problem.

  I have played "open games" on a smaller scale (MUDs) in which PvP is
handled relatively well.  It doesn't provide the same kind of stimulus as a
pure PvE game, true, but many find the stimulus better and more exciting.
It's always a more rewarding feeling to defeat a fellow player than it is an
element of the environment (like a mob)... not necessarily because you've
caused the other player grief, but because it's a more dynamic challenge.

  Sometimes you'll get "ganked" in games, true, and it happens often enough
and annoys you enough when it occurs, the game won't be enjoyable... but
that's not the case for everybody.

  If you're strictly against the idea of PvP, I'd guess no amount of
argument is going to convince you it can be fun, so I won't try any further.
Suffice to say, though... I don't think you have to be a total griefer in
order to enjoy PvP.  You're entitled to your opinion if you think otherwise,
of course.
