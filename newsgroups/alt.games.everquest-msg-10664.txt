Interesting way of reading that bit.  Did he not mention a comparison to
necros because they are less soloable than druids and SKs or did he not
mention them because the beastmasters will barely be better at soloing
than SKs, not as good as druids so they come no where near the ability
of necros?  He never says anything about what classes are most soloable,
just using existing classes as a benchmark to give an idea of what the
beastmaster can do yet you read it as him saying that druids are the
best soloers.  Interesting.
