Only 4hp per tick atm.  I rarely get below 80% health when soloing, and 
the only reason I'm nearly dead when we pull something in a group is 
because those damned tanks have so much more HP than I do :)  Anyway, 
it'd *start* to help about now, although I'd rather have a better heal 
(necros need CH!!) to begin with, because if I get my health too low, we 
pull, and the big mean thing goes "ooh look, that necro's already 
almost-dead, let's finish the job."  Not sure why it suddenly started, 
I'd healed someone till I was near-dead before with no problem, and I 
was careful not to cast any spells until I got some health back.  So now 
I don't let the tanks suck me down past 10%, and I find a weak wanderer 
to ha--err lifetap for my own heals.

I'm actually enjoying juggling my HP, the tank's HP, and my mana supply 
*g*
