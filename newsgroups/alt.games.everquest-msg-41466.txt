Its seems that some people (not pointing any fingers...) didn't understand
what I meant.

Bush is not stupid enough to go half cocked shooting off missiles and
sending men and women to their DEATHS. He knows he needs to be sure about
his decision before he does anything.

That is all I meant, but yes I was making a joke at his expense.

I rather not have war but it is part of human nature to have change and
such.
