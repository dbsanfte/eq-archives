Maybe others, dunno, but not a.g.e.

This subject was an off-topic sub thread (imagine that! :) )  a few weeks
ago.  I said that I didn't get much spam.

Well, I checked my deleted mail since 11/23 at home and I have 9 unsolicited
corporate-type emails (legit businesses and
get-rich-quick-and-have-sex-doing-it type mail).   Now, this is at home.  I
forgot to check work (I check deharmon@bigfoot.com there too) but just for
the fun of it let's say I get 18 there.  A total of 27 in 10 days would be a
good guess.

I did a search on myself at groups.google.com and it only displays 1000
posts.  I'm a busy guy, that 1000 only goes back to February (man, I gotta
get another hobby!).  The vast majority are in a.g.e but I've posted in
daoc's a number of times, and a Microsoft site or two, oh, probably a couple
dozen times since 2/01.

I dare say that if *I* don't get spam out the yin-yang, I seriously doubt if
Usenet is where you're getting YOURS.

I think I avoid most of mine by not only saying "no, I don't want no
freakin' spam from you" on any sort of sign-in sheet, but also any site that
has no business having my email address - but requires it nonetheless - I
give them the president of AOL's published address (hey, I figure AOL is so
proud of their spam controls, I'm sure it'll take care of any added mail *I*
send their way :p ).

When's EQ coming back up? :p  Guess I'll go play DAOC and get bored.  Don't
know what I'll do then...that'll only be about an hour from now and I don't
go to bed for another 4 hours.

Oh yeah, the Jill Hennessy show is on tonight. *sigh*  She's older than the
average EQ player (32 as of last week per www.imdb.com), but DAMN is she
hot. *sigh*  I love imdb...it mentions she has a twin.  I'll take either
one. :)
