Anyone who has played EQ for a while knows that there is no perfect
loot system, there are reasonable and unreasonable ones.  But mostly
that applies to loot distributin within a guild, I can not remember
the last time I had looting issues in a group, perhaps I am on a more
"mature" server. /shrug

Here is how it works where I come from (be it LDoN or PoF XP groups):

Before the fray begins a ML is assigned, a person who will have enough
time to do the job.

nodrop item drops:
ML announces loot (really easy now)
all who can use, and to whom it would be an upgrade, /ran 100, highest
roller wins, winner does not roll on next loot until everyone in the
group gets something, unless winner is only one who can use next loot,
then it will be defaulted to him/her

droppable drops:
ML announces loot and loots it
At the end of the adventure (or when someone leaves in a regular xp
group), ML reannounces all the droppable loot he or she collected,
need will be established

primary need (as in main will use) will be rolled on first, /ran 100
highest wins, people who received nodrop loot are ot eligible to roll
on this
greed need (alt toons, bazaar, giving away for cyber, whatever),
everyone can roll (also those who received nodrop and previous
droppable loot), /ran 100 highest wins, sellables will be sold by MLer
(unless people want stuff for tradeskils in which case it will be
given to whoever wants it), proceeds will be split

tis does sound like those who get nodrop or droppable loot based on
need have an advantage, and in theory they do, but in all this time
only very few took real advantage of this, most who received nodrop or
droppable loot based on need will pass on greed rolls in favor of
those who have not gotten anything yet

I really can not remember the last time I had a problem with this, and
I have some 197 days /played

FARMING GROUPS!!!
Different rule for pure farming groups (i.e.: 4C)!
In farming groups all bets are off.  4C is one of my favorite spots,
always empty and lots of cash to be made while having fun!  Another
plus is that you don't need to be elemental to get there (sure there
are elemental spots that yield better drops, Tactics does too
especially if you grab Pig Boy as well when he is up, but again 4C is
empty all the time, while Tactics is camped solid by damn druids
soloing the piggy!).  Anyway, loot rule for farming group:
Droppable loot drops, ML announces, ML loots, then it will be /ran 100
as soon as there is a break in the spawns. High roller wins.  Next
item drops, previous winner has two choices, he or she can either
stick to the previous win, and is not eligible to roll again till
everyone got something, or he or she can put the previous win "back in
the pool", roll for the current drop, and then th previous drop will
be rolled off again.

If you put your old loot "back in the pool", and you do not win the
new loot, nothing happens, you keep your old loot.  If you do win the
new loot, then there is a roll on your old loot, and you pass your old
loot to the winner.

Sounds a bit complicated, but makes perfect sense once you did it
once.  Main reason for the pool is that when we head to a farming
group all rolls are for greed, and something you may want to use may
drop, so with the "back in the pool" you do have a shot at an item you
want to use (or at at item of higher value, or whatever).
