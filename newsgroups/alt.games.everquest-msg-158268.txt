I bought a bunch of the previously drop only hybrid spells 
in the pok library. You can tell which ones they are since they
are higher level (like 50 plus) yet all cost 4 plat 1 gold 8 copper.

Then I went to the bazaar and priced them all at 25 plat each. I went 
AFK with this afk message:

"All of these hybrid spells can be bought in the Plane of knowledge
library for 4 plat, 1 gold, 8 copper each if you think 25 plat is too
much."

I sold like 10 of them.

Funny ;) Other people were selling them for from 50 plat to 2k or
something, which was my main reason for selling them for less.
