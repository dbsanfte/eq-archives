There is a zone in/on Luclin that is called the Bazaar. The idea of the zone
is to replace previous trading zones (of course people will still use EC and
Gfay but not to the same extent) The zone has 2 banks each with 4 bankers
and an Arena for duelling.
What is meant to be implemented (and what I meant by "Bazaar Code") is that
it is planned for players to be able to set up shop like a merchant,
something like you enter items that you wish to sell and for what price and
people can come and inspect you for them, look at the item etc...I should
think people will still use auction but it should cut down on it. This is
something similar to what AO has I believe but unfortunately Verant haven't
got it working right yet and it'd be a really bad idea to release something
like this and not be 100%, lots of players losing plat and items in trade
bugs would not go down well and create all sorts of headaches for CS and
GM's.
I am looking forward to it's release but will only trust it to lesser items
for the first month, I can deal with losing 500pp in items or cash...losing
5000pp would put more of a dampener on my day, though.
