That reminded me of when my Barb warrior was in Blackburrow... a bunch of us
from different parties got bored at the same time, so we arranged a train
for fun.

We warned everyone what we were going to do, set a time, and shouted the
countdown of how many minutes before we set the train off, so folk had time
to plan.

Most of us gathered near the QH zoneline, one person picked just the right
gnoll, while standing up top of the ledge, and zapped him.  Someone else in
another location may have chose another gnoll as deep inside the zone as
possible and agged him as well.

About a full minute and a half later, up from the Gnoll pit come bubbling up
more dark blue fur than you've ever seen before in your life.  Most of us
stood and fought for a while at the QH zoneline area.  Half of us died.
Most everyone else zoned.  I had a few gnolls on me off to the side, and
somehow survived, as the main train seemed to bypass me while it ran
everyone else down.

That was fun.
