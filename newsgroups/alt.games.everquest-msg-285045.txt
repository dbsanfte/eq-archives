Actually, warrior disciplines have been in all along.  Its a sore spot, 
as not only were hybrid disciplines not in, but even the other non 
casting tank class disciplines weren't in.  We could all use those few 
disc tomes which overlapped warrior, and no others.

For SK, this meant Fearless and Resistant, both in the 50s, and neither 
all that impressive, although they do see some use on boss mob kills.

Yesterday, a slew of tomes were added to a vendor in the EC tunnel; some 
but by no means all of the disciplines everyone was missing are found 
there now.

For SK, in particular, Unholy Aura, and Leechcurse; levels 55 and 60 
respectively.

Unholy Aura lasts 5 minutes, and any HT you use during that time is 
roughly doubled; my normally just over 1000 hp HT at 60 landed for just 
over 2000 hp on a light blue mob I was experimenting on.

OK, thats kind of silly; a 5 minute duration is a joke on an ability 
which can only be used once every hour or so.  Worse, HT is among the 
more useless ideas I've seen, you only pull it out when its really 
needed, because it has such a long reuse timer, but then it turns out to 
be resisted about as often as a lifetap... so odds are, if you need it, 
its not going to work.  Compare that to LOH, which is never resisted!

If it had been a second HT it would have had much the same effect, 
doubling my HT output per hour potentially... but I'd have used HT more 
often, since I'd have one in reserve still, so it would probably have 
quadrupled my HT output per day.

But barring that, since using HT is an instant effect, if it had just 
come right out and doubled my HT damage permanently, it would be less 
annoying.  Click this discipline and your HT timer resets but you do a 
double damage HT.  Effectively thats what its going to be used as, 
anyway, click discipline, click HT, click discipline off.

Speaking of which, how do you click a disc off anyway?  I put it in my 
combat abilities window alongside my other discs, and when I clicked on 
it again after using my HT, I just got a message about the reuse timer. 
  It didn't show up in my Buff window, so I couldn't click it off there 
either.  Maybe it turns itself off automatically after the HT is burned? 
  That would be helful, at least.

Second ability, Leechcurse.  Apparantly while this one is up, every 
melee damage I do also counts as a heal to me.  This would be good news 
if I was a melee DPS class, but I'm a tank.  What would really mean 
something would be if every time I took damage it counted as a heal to 
me... cause damage taking, thats something I do well!.  At any rate, 24 
seconds worth of this lifetapping stuff, once every hour or so.

I tested this out on a light blue mob, unbuffed, I started the 
discipline when at 74% hp, and ended it at 78% hp.  Of course the mob 
was hitting me some during that time, so it probably added up to more. 
And I wasn't buffed to the gills or using a good weapon (just a MOSS) or 
anything.  But at the moment, I'm underwhelmed.

Consider the Defensive discipline; this thing is THE reason that 
warriors are taken over SK as MT on raids.  Reusable every 5 minutes, 
its actually practical for single groups, use on overpulls or on nameds, 
its probably going to pop back up before the next pull you'd want to use 
it on.  Lasts 3 minutes... so you could literally be in defensive 3/5ths 
the time?  Maybe I'm doing the math wrong there.  But compare 3 minutes 
every 5 minutes to 24 seconds every hour... and this is my 60 
discipline!  Meanwhile, what does it actually do?  Increases melee 
mititgation.  Yeah, you heard that right, it actually makes the tank 
better at doing the only thing he's good at doing!

I'm glad these are in, so I can stop feeling Combine Server warrior 
envy... but now instead I feel a more generic SK class warrior envy, its 
not just because only the warrior tome vendor was in the game, it turns 
out SK disciplines aren't at all competitive with the warrior ones anyway!
