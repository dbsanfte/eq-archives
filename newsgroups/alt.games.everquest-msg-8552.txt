And kiting away from others is how *I* do it.  The original poster either
ran into a dr00d (who have gotten me killed, who the Hell kites 4 cougars
into the igloos at Iceclad) or was dumb enough to sit in the path of a druid
already kiting.  To hate dr00ds who kite into/too close to people is
understandable.  To try to ban kiting is just envy.
