Somebody on the eqcleric forums did a parse of a warrior and cleric
with similar AC and no AA getting beat on. They found that mitigation
was the same (they were hit for roughly the same amount)(*) but
avoidance was much worse (the cleric was hit much more often). There
was some speculation that this is due to the laughably low cleric
Dodge cap.

In particular check JanSorensen's parse results at the bottom of
page 3.

(*) Well, OK, Jan's parse shows a 297 vs. 299 average hit. Close enough.
