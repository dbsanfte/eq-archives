I run on a Compaq Armada 700 laptop and I've not had much problem with it --
win2k system, 128Meg RAM...  Biggest problem I had was doing the adjustments
to the video -- mippmapping on to get an odd chirping effect out of the 3d
rendering.

Beyond that, I've hit only a couple problems with video in the game -- some
remnant traces but, when I logged off and back on and it cleared up.  the
other was running 'normal screen' mode.  When I zoned I'd sometimes have to
toggle through the screens (F10) to get the video straightened out (screen
would only show a block under cursor -- rest was outside background...)

Don't know if this helps at all but it can work with a laptop.  Try
adjusting the video and audio settings a bit.
