I'd say geforce 3 ti 500 but only because basically geforce and nvidia
are the true winners of the video card wars. Nvidia updates the
reference drivers constantly, they update linux and other unix drivers
constantly also THEMSELVES which are FANTASTIC hardware accelerated
drivers if you ever feel like multi booting to linux. 

How great the linux drivers and the drivers for win 98 for my now VERY
old tnt 16 meg agp card (which STILL does quite well in EQ, well
enough anyway) means that I'll always buy nvidia graphics cards and no
others. 

This tnt card is a freaking workhorse and still plays the newest games
well enough, how many other cards roughly 3 years old can you say that
about? I mean I play with all models enabled in Luclin and its
playable and looks fine with textures set to low (course I have 585
meg of ram and 71 meg set aside for graphics textures, evidently
either EQ or my tnt 16 meg AGP card must run in pci compatibility mode
so that actually helps)

For my money I could not see a better card to buy then the around $190
or so geforce 3. If its anything like my tnt 16 meg agp card it will
be more than fine for possibly 4 years. Meanwhile, as with 3dfx, ATI
could go belly up tomorrow. That is simply not going to happen with
nvidia. They are already getting smart and branching out with a chip
in the xbox and such instead of putting all eggs in one basket.

ATI is FINALLY being the first vid card chip maker to get smart and
follow in nvidias footsteps though (well, except for Kyro) and is now
going to let hercules and possibly some other companies make reference
cards with 8500 chips. Hercules in fact is discontinuing nvidia
altogether and going for just making ATI chip cards (probably because
they feel there is so much competition with nvidia ones already)

EQ has problems with both AMD cpus and geforce cards and also some ATI
set ups. It seems to be more problems they need to patch with EQ
rather than the cards though, or possibly problems with the person's
computer and heat/power which only are seen with an app which stresses
the system like everquest does.
