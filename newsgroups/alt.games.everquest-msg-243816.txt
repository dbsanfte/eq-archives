Any 10 wins at one camp will upgrade your charm augment. It doesn't
upgrade the charm itself, rather the augment you got when you finished
the Magus quest to be able to port around between the wayfarer camps. 

Every upgrade is +2 hitpoints/mana, every 5th upgrade also gives you
+1 to all stats and resists.

Basically, yes.

5 camps with 8 different dungeon per camp so 40 different dungeon
layouts. You can't really call them all 'different LDoN experiences'
though, all dungeons withing a wayfarer camp tend to have feel the
same; same mobs, same loot, same types of passages and rooms...
