Really?  I wasn't aware of the faction differences in Freeport.
Course I haven't played a KOS race much, adn haven't burnt faction
killing guards in HHK, so I pretty much just cruised through the city
oblivious, cursing having to zone 3-4 times to go to the bank and
back.

Still..no reason why Kaladim and Qeynos couldn't be grouped up.
Cabilis there still may be problems, but I don't see why.
