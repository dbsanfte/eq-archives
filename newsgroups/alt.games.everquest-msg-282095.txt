	What a bunch of sony apologists! :-)   Hey, we're not talking
about uncovering subtle bugs in obscure and newly-added features.  We're
talking about breaking the guild lobby door twice in 3 patches.  We're
talking about introducing new special events that...don't even begin to
work.  We're talking about performing a patch that makes the game 
unplayable on Windows 98.

	At least I am.  This doesn't require exhaustive testing. None
of it's based on tricky little configuration quirks on .0001% of the
client systems.   All it needs is for someone to patch a test system 
set up exactly the way the real ones are, then ***try the new mission**.
Or whatever.

	Although you may be right.  It might not be a testing problem
so much as a release control issue.  You're also right in that it
doesn't matter because even people who are willing to admit that Sony
does a...less than stellar...job in this probably won't leave the game
over it.
