Not quite sure if the number 4 post was to me.  Never said my account was
stolen.
Matter a fact I wouldnt care if someone stole my account because I cancelled
it.
I have no desire to play a game run by these idiots. (wait till you see the
bottom)

I was merely stating that they will ban your account if you say its stolen.
(Pause for a second and really think it about that) Then I introduced ways that
are completely not your fault, that your account can be stolen.  Thus, not
making dumb mistakes, you can lose your account.

This game, I admit has given me a huge amount of fun, along with a huge amount
of headache.  Those 2 can kinda balance out each other (no they dont, i just
cant think why i played so long).  But the way Verant conducts itself is
shamefull.  Guilty till innocent, but never proclaimed innocent because they
(verant) will never suck it up and admit they are wrong.

Therefore here's my mule account information.  Thats right my station name and
password. Good luck on the first person who see this.

YAULT-station name
MOON-password

p.s- beware this account will most likely be axed after a veridiot sees it.
