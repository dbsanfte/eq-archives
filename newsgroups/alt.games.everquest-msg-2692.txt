I never bothered getting a bind anywhere else.  I make it a big point to not
die.  I really hate dying.. heh.

However, if you want, you can get bound in Freeport.  The entire E/W
Freeport zones are bindable, so you can just get bound out in the newbie
snake/rat area.  Just keep away from the guards.  There are also hidden
tunnels in the walls that go below the city and you can get bound in there
if you want to play it safe.

But yeah, you will be making trips back to Grobb to train.  You might be
able to train in Neriak, but I usually just went back go Grobb anyway.
Neriak is sort of a haul also when you consider you have to go through EC,
Nek, Ner 1, 2, and 3.  Grobb is Oasis, S. Ro, Swamp, Grobb.  So really it's
about the same, plus you don't have to worry about some crazy dark elf
killing you when you're not expecting it.  (Don't know if any would, but
like I said I hate dying so I try and not test these things out.)
