You're far too generous to developers and too trendishly trashy of "suits".
But "the man" isn't the enemy, he is us. Developers I've known over the
years (and I've managed thousands of them) have often been just as guilty as
management at putting known bugs out into the userbase in order to get them
fixed and meet a ship date. Generally I would agree that most developers
don't want to work this way (and they sure as hell don't stay that way in my
organization) and it's also true that management is generally more willing
to ship a known bug than a developer, but it ain't alwaya so. In fact, I'd
say the trend is in the other direction. I see more management coming to
understand the critical cost issues associated with poor quality, and more
developers willing to get users exposed to bugs in order to help find and
fix them. Software development is such a funny business ...
