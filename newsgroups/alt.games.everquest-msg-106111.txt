I'm not sure what you're on, but you might want to cut the dosage a
bit.  The give back is only stuff that the NPC has no interest in.  If
it's for a quest, obviously he has interest in it, so will not be
giving it back.

Velious armor is DESIGNED to be multi-quested.  There isn't a single
piece of Skyshire or Kael that is soloable, and the stuff is rare
enough that you're not going to have pieces rot if you don't MQ it.  

Verant has changed their stance on a number of issues recently, and
they've been making things easier for the players.  They certainly
have shown no desire to introduce a nerf of the magnitude that you are
envisioning.  Multi-questing is a fact of EverQuest.  It's not going
away.
