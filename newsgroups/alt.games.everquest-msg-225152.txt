Its not all bad...

These days companies frequently get 2,000+ applications or more in just 
a few days when they advertise a position. Better to:

automate and search for keywords to select which resumes to read

vs

just read the first few hundred or so, picking out the good ones, and 
stopping when you hit 20 or 30, and hiring from that pool, dumping the 
rest in the 'file for a year bin'.

At least the automatic processors have a shot at getting resume 1,843 
even looked at by a human being. And with internet job listings etc, and 
companies that, for a fee, will spam your resume to every company that's 
hired anybody in the last 30 years... companies have to find efficient 
ways of weeding through the mass of incoming resumes... not so much to 
determine who to hire... but to determine which should even get read. If 
your qualified but it gets dropped by the parser that's unfortunate to 
be sure... but if you were resume 1,843 it wasn't going to get read 
anyways...
