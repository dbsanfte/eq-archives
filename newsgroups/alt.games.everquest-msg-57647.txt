<uninformed propaganda snipped>

How on Earth could Jefferson have written a letter to the government of
Israel, when the State of Israel didn't exist until 1948?  I don't suppose
that anyone who buys into this bullshit would be interested in that little
fact anyway.  Never believe anything you read on the Internet folks.

Sorry for the off topic post, but I just thought I'd point out that little
tidbit for those of you who might be gullible enough to fall for this racist
crap.  But then again, if you believe in this crap, you probably won't be
deterred by anything so trivial as the truth.
