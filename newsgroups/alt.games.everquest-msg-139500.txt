I agree with equal rights for everyone, and support that un-equivically but
it undermines the progress of equal rights and fair human practice when we
make a "day" for all different walks of life.
this is only an example, i truely do not have numbers for this, but it is
done just to show a meaning to what i am saying.

10,000 people in Terrace, of which 500 are homosexual - they are entitled to
a gay pride day - fair enough.
then the 1000 doukhabours get a day also, and the 5000 recreational vehicle
users get a day also - i know i am going overboard, but i want to make a
point - just because a person or persons have a way of life or a background
or a culture should not at the same time mean they are entitled to a special
day to have a parade or celebrate their differences or uniqueness.
Ontario has a HUGE number of people from Newfoundland living here, should
they not be afforded a "Newfie" day and a parade also? and if so, by the
time every group of people is given such a day, are we going to have to have
days which are double booked as i am sure there is not enough days on a
calendar to support everyone! :)

Yes, it was a little rant - but although i have no probs supporting fairness
and equal rights, they have to be just that - fair and equal to EVERYONE,
not just singling out an individual group and making that the centre of
attention.
Would it not be enough to acknowledge the differences and individuality of
each and everyone, instead of making it a crusade and forcing it on those
who choose not to accept it or those who would just rather live their lives
without getting involved.
Unfortunately for the gay community, i feel it will only end up being
detrimental to what they truely want, just to be able to live and enjoy
their lives the way they choose to - my lifestyles aren't forced into the
media or onto the streets of a city just to make my lifestyle known - which,
although i am sure this will be denied, is the reason behind such things
now - gay pride day was originally a good and fair idea, now it is an agenda
to force others to see and acknowledge, even if they would just prefer not
to.
People do NOT have to agree with homosexuality to be able to allow fairness,
nor do they have to support a gay lifestyle to support fairness - one is an
individual group, the other is plain and simple human rights.
