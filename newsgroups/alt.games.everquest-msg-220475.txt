Unless you actually become encumbered, that is. Then you will not be able 
to move as fast or jump. I'm not the only one who has forgotten to put a 
whole truckload of money back in the bank and zoned out of the Bazaar, only 
to be rooted to the spot on the other side.

Also, I've seen in the past that the large races will be unable to jump if 
carrying more than a certain weight, whether they are encumbered or not.

Unless any of that has changed recently. (?)
