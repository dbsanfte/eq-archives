I didn't see my problem described in a quick scan of the group and
the EQ tech help forum, so I'm throwing it up here in the hope that
somebody can give me a good suggestion how to proceed.

I'm using a 64MB NVidia GeForce2 Ti with the latest drivers (56.64)
downloaded and installed per the suggestion of the popup from EQ
when I first ran it after the patch.

Symptoms:
As soon as EQ goes to the game load screen (after server select) colors
get hatched and about half of the graphics display is unrecognizeable.
I didn't bother to log a character in, the character select screen was
surreal enough in appearance.  Rebooting and killing the NVidia app
launcher in the tray did not make any change.  Colors remain hatched
after exiting EQ.

thank you in advance to anybody who can point me at a fix,
kaev
