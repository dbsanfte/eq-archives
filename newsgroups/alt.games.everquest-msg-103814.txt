Heh I have had several stacks at one time and you would be amazed at the people
in shadeweavers thicket trying to sell HQ hopper hides for 30pp each. I tell
them that they are too common and disposable to sell for that price but you
would be amazed at the people from the old world that come over and buy them for
that. Something to make a young Vah Shir rich off the tourists. Hehe.
