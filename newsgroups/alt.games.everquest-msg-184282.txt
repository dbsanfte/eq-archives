Of a total of 170 zones (NOT counting Legacy of Ykesha zones, of which I 
don't know the exact number), around 62 were included with the old world, 
with the rest being either expansions or freebie zones. Since (170 + LoY) 
> 62, I postulate that EQ is bigger than it was before. As to how this 
affects player density, it is like this:

[player density] = [number of players] / [number of zones]

Therefore, as [number of zones] increases, [player density] decreases. 
Quod Erat Demonstrandum.

Of course, you can claim that [player density] decreases as a factor of [
number of players] decreasing, but since this is in direct contradiction 
to information provided by Sony (the people who actually *have* the info), 
the burden of proof falls on you... So, until you provide reasonable 
proof of EQ having fewer players now than before, I have to side with 
Kosh here. That the zones are less crowded does not constitute proof, as 
demonstrated above.
