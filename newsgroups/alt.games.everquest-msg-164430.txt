The information we had when we passed the trials is the same info you and
anybody else had access to.

We were in PoV I think 2 days after PoP came out, yeah thanks leet strats
and walkthroughs that were out back then!

Oh shut the fuck up already.  I helped a friend get flagged who wields a
Sceptre of Mastery, hardly something you'd call uber (drops in kael arena).
I've seen guilds who are at the velk/vindi stage complete the trials, all
you need is a competent group and a bit of luck...  I guess your groups
don't match the compotent requirements though

Nice to know how you judge every guild your jealous of.

And for the record all of like 1 guilds across every server exploited Seru
in that way, and it sure wasn't us.
