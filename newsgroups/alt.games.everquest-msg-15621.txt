I recently took a break from EverCrack to mow the lawn (You mean the real
world doesn't stop when I play). One question did form in my mind; Who mows
the grass in Norrath? I mean I never see some guy riding around on a John
Deer with one of those umbrella/hats, holding a beer in one hand and this
month's Who's Who in Norrath in the other. If there is someone/thing mowing
the grass, I want THAT mower. I figure I could use one that is +5 on STR,
has a spell of Sharpness and +5 on Mulching. Or is it just green astro-turf?
If so, I want my fees reduced 'cuz astro-turf is cheaper to maintain than
the grass.

360 minutes till I can play again.
I think I'm loosing it big time.
