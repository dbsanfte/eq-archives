The "spells cost money" argument does not wash, as that is a capital
investment, and not a running cost. Casters buy the spells in order to use
them for their own benefit, the only thing that gets used when buffing is
mana. Mana=Medding time=Money?.

No you wouldnt, but you would see a tank running to the assistance of
someone who yells while passing by (with no expectation of reward
whatsoever). In assisting someone they will use their weapons and armour,
which cost pp. This uses up a tanks time. Time=Money. Can you imagine a tank
demanding money for preventing a death?!!? Outrageous!....but isnt that the
same as a 100% xp rez after death?

Just some comments. Please feel free to flame.
