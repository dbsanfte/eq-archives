   Why are people who are willing to make a negative assessment of a
future product in which limited hard data is avail any more idiotic than
those who swear it is going to be great?  You are passing judgement on
it exactly the same as they are, while having access to the same
information about the game.

   I'm interested in EQII, and have read up on it.  It seems to me that
while there are alot of interesting concepts, there are many others that
could lead it to go either way.
