Have you considered a Beastlord?  not sure which race, if any, that can be a
BL will have hide sneak though.  My main is a Halflfing Druid and I have
seen some of the remarks of others, however I made him prior to knowing this

behind the toon before the judge me, well then who is the peewit? =)  But
just wanted to mention that BL's are good soloers' too =)

Peace!
