    Ok, this is second-hand through my guild's level 60 BST, so parts of it
won't be exactly right but the gist of it will be. Every time you summon a
new warder in a given zone, the warder's index number gets bumped up by one.
So if you summon Frae's_Warder01, then it dies, the next one you summon in
the same zone will be Frae's_Warder02. Or when you zone back into Lake of
Ill Omen, if the last time you were there you had Frae's_Warder05, the one
walking beside you after you zone in will be Frae's_Warder06. This goes on
until a patch, when the index number is reset back to one.

    There is a limit to how many Frae's_Warders you can summon in a given
zone. The number she told me is 99 I think, I'm not sure on that (check an
EQ BST board, they'd know the exact number). Once number 99 (assuming that's
the correct number) dies or goes away when you zone, that's it - you can't
summon another warder in that zone until a patch. To check what number
warder you have, set the little tyke to /guard here and move far away, then
try to trade a coin to him. You should get the message "You are too far away
from Frae's_WarderX to trade", where X is the index number.
