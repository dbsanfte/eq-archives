I mention number of posts simply because it seems a bit odd that the
maintainer of a newsgroup's FAQ would be someone who posts so
infrequently... And, yes, 327 posts in over 2 years is quite
infrequent. Some of us go over that in a week. ><

Like I said, most of it's good. Some of the "newsgroup specific" items
might need to be run by the group from time to time, though. A little
more activity than simply posting the FAQ as a whole from time to
time, I'd say.

And, no, I'm not offering or attempting to take over. God knows I have
enough on my hands between EQ guild stuff and RL (especially now.
Gawd, anyone know how much of a hassle it is to move cross-country on
a tight budget?!). Just offering observations.
