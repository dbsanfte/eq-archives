Another way to verify it is to "give" items to the mob.  As
you can prove by giving an item to a mob and then killing it,
"given" items end up in their "general loot" list (not counting
No Drop items, which poof if you hand them over).

You can give a normal item to a mob (e.g. a Bone Chips), and you'll
eventually pickpocket it back from them if you pickpocket
long enough, which demonstrates that the pickpocketed items
come from the "general loot" list.
