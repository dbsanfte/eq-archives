I *sorta* accepted a gift once:
I had accumulated the items to make my *Felwithe Gate Idol*, (I can't think of
it's proper name).  But my friend didn't think he was high enough level to do
the combine for me.  So I was /OOCing in POK "donating for a high level
combine" and I got a tell from a high level shaman who knew right away what I
was trying to do.  So she, (I *assume* it was a she, she was in bear form) did
the combine, but it failed.  I offered her the 2 KP donation anyway, but she
refused it, then told me to wait for a few minutes.
She logged on some other characters, did some transfers, sent me back to the
bazaar for a few more items, and WaLa!  I had my idol !!!   She still refused
the 2 KP, even though the items needed for the combine were way more expensive
than that, so I know *she* was out *thousands* of plat in the end.
Then she told me to consider it repayment for when I got ported out to skyfire
and drug all her friends corpses to the BW zoneline and rezzed them and refused
*their* donations, (I never take plat for rezzes).
It was the nicest thing anyone ever did for me.  And it really bugs me that I
can't remember her name... Risha, Resha, Rasha.... something like that.  And
all her alts were named along the same line...  
So, yeah, to some degree, you are right.
