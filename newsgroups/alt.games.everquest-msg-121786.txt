The real world's crazy, I assure you.  I've heard of EQ items being
auctioned on eBay for over $1000.  It's absolutely utterly barking mad.  And
it's not as if it's an investment.  When EQ inevitably gets shut down,
where's your money gone?  It's just disappeared.  'Course I probably just
don't understand, being still stuck on level 10.  For me, 100pp seems like a
king's fortune - 50,000pp is the kind of money I'd only ever dream about.

I still wouldn't fork out so much as a single real-life pound to buy it,
though.
