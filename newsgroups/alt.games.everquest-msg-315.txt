...attempted kill-stealing?  That might be so under some circumstances, but
when the mob is at 40%, the guy getting beaten down is at 10%, and I put a
backstab in to get it's attention so the otherguy can get away/survive the
fight, there is no way in hell it could be seen as an attempted ks.  UNLESS
the person getting rescued is a complete ass.

Other examples:

1) Healing, damageshielding, SoWing in tough situations

2) Getting the attention of a mob chasing a pc (could be a snare, could be
an attack, whatever).

3) KewlDood_00 asks you, "Hey, I see your body way down here surrounded by
level 50 mobs that see through invis, but I can drag it out easily if you
like."  I guess you'd either ignore the offer or tell him you don't accept
help from "Kewld00ds."

Plenty of other ways...these are just the few I came up with in the 5
minutes I had to write this message.


: list of things that don't make sense in game, but are required/convenient...
: The lifts in Kelethin. How do they operate? There's no chains or ropes
: moving those platforms. The point I am making about /shout is that it is 99%
: Quaker spam, and only 1% relevant, such as shouting about trains and the
: such. If people would use the /ooc channel properly, this problem would not
: exist. Yet, you can't expect the quakers to even know what /ooc refers to
: when they come into this game

That's entirely a matter of what zone you are in, mostly.  For another
thing, do you see no "sensible" reason for having long range, audible
messaging?  

: You apparently missed the last message. "Handle" doesn't mean taking them

If by last message you mean the last one in our line of discussion, yeah, I
missed it.  If you mean the last one you posted, I probably hadn't received
it on this news server yet, or didn't bother to read it.  Can't read
everything.

: out.. it means how to react in th name of safety. If you sawa mod of angry
: rioters a few blocks down, I'm sure you wouldn't be able to take them on,
: but would have sense to run and get somewhere safe. Same concept applies
: here. You normally can see a train from a distance, enough time to react in
: a proper manner.

I have to question your experience in the game again... sometimes there is
NO WAY to know a train is coming until it is on you, unless someone shouts.

:> Basicly this amounts to "I haven't seen it, but I know I don't like it."

: No, not really actually. Guilds have websites with charters. The charters
: almost never match up with the guild messageboards. What they say and do are
: 2 different things.

Ok, tell me then, what experience do you have with the current RP guilds on
Fennin to put so little faith in them?  Which guilds, for that matter?  Are
you assuming that everything on a message board bin in character?  You might
find that everything outside of the game is ooc, while they try to remain in
character in game as much as they can.  Nothing *wrong* with that if that's
the way they are set up.
