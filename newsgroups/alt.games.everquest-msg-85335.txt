Ok, just a couple of nights ago I was mega-spammed by a couple
of jackasses inspecting me as I was soloing.  I probably had
about 300 inspection messages fly by during the course of the
battle.  I sifted through all the replies on this thread but
an actual solution didn't jump out at me as to how you turn
the inspection messages off.

Please say there is a way and I won't be subject to this nonsense
anymore!
