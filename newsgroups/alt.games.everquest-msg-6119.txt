Subject: Hmmm.. Paladin or Cleric?

I'm wondering... I'd love to be able to Gate and Bind, and I like the idea of
helping others, so I'm leaning towards a Cleric.  But everyone says how boring
it is, and how it's not worth it, because Druids and Shamans can oust you for
the healing spot in a group.

And while I'd love to be able to Gate and Bind, I may start a Paladin instead. 
They seem like a truly fun class to play.  Any suggestions?

My last option is a Troll/Ogre warrior.  I have always played the big, evil
races though.  For my return to EQ I wanted something different, heh.
