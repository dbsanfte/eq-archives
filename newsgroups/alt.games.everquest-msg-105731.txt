Verant is showing how much they want a new generation of  players by all the
newbie stuff they keep adding. No chance of losing items due to corpse
decay. Low level rezes. Low level Group evacs. Low level corpse summoning.
These are all fine and good but your not allowed to have your high level
character equip your new low level character. I am waiting to hear that all
looted items will now be No Drop, or if it drops from a level 30 mob you
must be level 30 to equip. Nerfed item like the Venomus Axe and the Rumor or
Hoax of the Nerfed Fungi. Looks to me like they Verant doesn't want high
level players createing new characters.
