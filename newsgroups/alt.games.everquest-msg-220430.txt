Depends how you define crucial. If something is so ridiculously time 
consuming and unlikely to succeed without track that it ceases to be a 
remotely effective use of your time then track is crucial. Having track 
is the most important skill to your group in order to complete the 
objective.

And seeing as the definition of crucial doesn't *require* something to 
be strictly impossible if the 'crucial aspect' is absent it is not an 
improper application of the word.
