Couldn't agree with you more.  What makes the difference if you are a 5th lvl
trying to take down an giant bat, or a 30th lvl trying to fight a grif in NK? 
To the characters in their teens, a crag spider may as well be a dragon.  Sure
it sounds nice having uber weapons and armor, but is it really so different
from a great leather tunic and a club when you're in WK wtih a friend, trying
to stay alive fighting those lions and griz bears?  From armor to weapons, and
levels to crits, what they are called is just a label, and how well you play
the various crits ar the appropriate level, marks you as a good player. 

Isn't busting your ass to reach lvl 50 like eating that ice cream cone real
fast to get it over with?  What do you have when your through, a headache AND
in the case of EQ a character that's gone about as far as you can go.... 

Just my thoughts
Rick
