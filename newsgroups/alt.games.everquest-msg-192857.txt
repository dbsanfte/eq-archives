if all you have is the spell scroll, then no, there's no way for
you to find out yourself what the spell does.  you'll have to ask
someone, or look on the web.

if you have the spell scribed and memorized, than you can experiment
to see what it does.  cast it on a monster and see what happens.
cast it on yourself and see what happens.  or just cheat and look
on the web.

just because a weapon or armor is MAGIC doesn't necessarily mean
that it has any special effect.  most don't.  if the item has an
effect, it will say so in the description box.

basically if a weapon is MAGIC, that just means that it can hit
creatures that are immune to "mundane" weapons, like will-o-wisps.

find out the places that are good for your level, and then just go
there and shout that you're looking for a group.  don't worry about
always grouping with the same people.
