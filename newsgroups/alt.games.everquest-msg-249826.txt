Nod nod nod!  Some zones are set up *so* sucky that it's no wonder no one plays
there.  Tenebrous Mountain comes to mind, and Twilight Sea is a close second. 
And Griegs End.  Mons Letalis has some great loot (hides) which makes it worthy
but not an easy zone to play in either.  
If all zones had equal experience bonus it would make the lesser played areas
more appealing.
