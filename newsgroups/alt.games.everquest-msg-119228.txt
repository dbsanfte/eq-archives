Well, as a 52 druid, all I can say is, bullshit.  If I feel like
charging for a port, there is none of this 'donation' crap.  I'll name
a price, or accept a given price.  To me the word 'donation' means
give what you can afford, and believe it or not sometimes even level
50+ players don't have a lot of plat on them.  Bogart, my druid,
currently has a grand total of 5pp in the bank.  

If you're porting somebody for the vague price of 'a donation' and
they cough up 3 plat, then it's your own fault for not having the
intestinal fortitude to actually name your damned price up front.
