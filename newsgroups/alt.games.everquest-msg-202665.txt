OK, having reread it, I can see where you have an issue with what he 
said.  It does depend on what you apply the exception in his sentence to.  
I applied it to both the "can't be trained" and "won't go up", you, otoh 
are applying it only to the final part.  Could certainly be interpretted 
either way, and clarification of that point is certainly a good thing.
