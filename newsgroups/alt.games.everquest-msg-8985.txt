I died this weekend, in a group of four, warrior, wiz, cleric,
enchanter. The warrior pulled three giants brea, brea, craig, and got a
some little gobby caster in the mix. The warrior gets to us with a
bubble of health and the cleric goes to work. I charm one of the brea,
fearing all the healing is going to put the cleric into danger, (and
like I said before, giants don't mez), and send the brea on the craig.

The gobby caster is messing with the cleric so i put it to sleep, and it
looks like we have things in hand, the craig falls, and then things
start to go a little bad, charm breaks a bit early. Wham, wham, not
wanting to aoe stun and wake the gobby I tried to re-charm, it works,
and breaks almost instantly, wham, wham, aoe fizzle (or interrupt)
things going bad, wham, wham ......

When I got back the cleric said that she did not notice I was going till
I was gone. Warrior said he noticed and was trying to taunt, but the 
giants hate was too much. They seriously don't like being charmed. I 
actually got experience when the last mob fell and nobody was below 
a bubble of health.

I was not, and am still not sore, I have died like that before, mostly
in pick-up groups where people did not understand the role of an
enchanter, or their vunerabilities. I also reflected on the fact that 
most of the good experiences I have had with my enchanter were with 
people I knew and ran around with often. If it had been my wifes cleric
I would not have died.
