I have had guildmates stuck below the world (which is fixed I think)
and unable to plan for over 5 hours on a weeknight. This occurred
while there were guides and GMs on the server. Verant dropped the toll
free support and have had me on hold for over an hour to deal with a
problem using a given sound card. Is this typical for online games?
Could be, not sure. Is the support at Amazon.com or other online
stores this bad? Not in my experience, but then people can always buy
from another store.

I'm sure that most of these type systems will be monthly fee ones. I
may have not stated it well. If these servers were for AMAZON or EBAY,
the owners would be very unhappy about an extra 3 hour outage because
of the sales they would lose. Given that, I'm sure that they spend a
lot of money on redundancy, and require sugnificant plans for outages
which they do have. My point was, if the people running AMAZON
consistantly had downtimes running one to three hours over the
estimates, would AMAZON be happy with their IS department? Again, I do
know its a different system, and VI is not dependant on uptime as much
as Amazon is. However, as a customer, I wish Verant used the same high
standards that Amazon uses. I like to be able to play when I have the
time.

Lets start with a help desk manned 24x7. Then lets add a toll free
number for getting in-game help. Basically a verbal petition. Barring
this, what about a live chat to a GM service desk. Some servers have
better GM support than others. Lets discuss an improve regression
testing for patches. Though better, there are still too many emergency
patches required after scheduled patches. Better QA and regression
testing would improve customer service and reduce downtime. After a
patch, how many times do you have to try and log in because the login
server is too small for a big rush. This could be fixed with money,
there are servers that could handle the load, VI has made a choice not
to have that. In addition, have you noticed the sever lag on patch
days? This is due to a overload network sending those patch files to
all the people logging in. I don't have statistics, but I can tell you
it is noticable to me on my cable modem. They need to beef up the
network.

I don't agree with your opinion on this. I know four people who left
EQ for just this reason. I also know another 10 or so who have not
left even though they had horrible service incidents. (Myself
included). Not a lot of people and certainly not a valid statistical
basis. Perhaps as stated in another message, I have too high of
expectations because I am held to such high ones myself. I don't know
what systems they are using and what budget constrants they are under?
Perhaps the MIS budget forces them to use the junior people to run the
systems. Perhaps it is the best they can do.
