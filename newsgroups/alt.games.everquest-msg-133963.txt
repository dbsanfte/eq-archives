    I have been playing EQ for a bit under 2 years now and through my
various uses of the 'Delete' key on the character select screen, I have
never managed any character past level 47. So? I am a poon, and I admit it.
    Once or twice I have come across a few quest items and what not that
have made me a good deal of coin *The Gnollslayer final, for one, before it
was nerfed to hell and back (which was done, btw, within a week of the quest
being completed), was easily selling for 20k on Stormhammer, with a
turn-around quest time of about 2 to 3 hours* and I almost immediately swore
that I would save the pp, usually as I was hitting the /auction channels and
zones to buy something or other... so forgive me if this sounds a bit
ignorant, but... am I just some dumbass toon that can't save a plat for it
burning a hole in my pocket, or am I missing something?
    I see things auctioned and sold for hundreds of thousands of plat, and I
just quietly drool into my coffee and daydream of the day when I can throw
around such weight *pun intended* in pure EQ *monopoly* money.
    Someone do tell...

Why can't I reply when it asks me "What would you like your tombstone to
