Welcome to the steaming pile of fecal matter that is the post 50 firepet.
He roots, annuls and has AE's available to him.

He now has less HP than air.  However he can handily outdamage a 54 ranger
with 1:2 ratio weapons and SCHW but no spell haste - IF he's behind the
mob.  You have to have a good MT and other melee help you, or you'll be
wasting huge amounts of med time repositioning him.  My most scathing 
condemnation of an MT is to reclaim a water pet (in an xp group) and bring
up an air pet.
 
> How about the air pet, is he also wacky in some way I'm not prepared for?

Air pet (like the earth) is a straight warrior - hits, bashes and kicks.
His stun now has a DD (like earth's spell).

I know you're holding off leveling - but 52 is a really bad spot for it
for a mage.  53 air will dramatically up your DPS - he's 4 levels higher,
and hits harder/
