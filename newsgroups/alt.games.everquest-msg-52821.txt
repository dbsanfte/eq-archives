Does anyone if there is any known compatibility problems with:
EQ, nVIDIA RIVA TNT2 m64 AGP, Windows 2000 AdvSrv

Everything was going good, I bought EQ, new Video Card, played for about a
week. Then I wanted to get the most current driver for my video card, so I
go and DL it, install it....also I installed SP2 for W2k around the same
time. Now when I play its sometimes glitchy and slow video. Thats if I get
to play at all. Now sometimes it will freeze up after I logon, or it will
just close EQ completly and go back to the desktop, or I will get the BSoD
with a message saying dumping physical memory 1,2,3,4,5...etc.  then it
reboots.
I've tried a variety of drivers including the one I first used when all was
going good, reinstalling the Video card. Could it be SP2 that I installed? I
can't figure it out and I wanna play damnit!!!  I was at a EQ website last
week that had drivers that you could DL. Does anyone know what it is?
If anyone has any suggestions or advice please let me know.
Thanks
