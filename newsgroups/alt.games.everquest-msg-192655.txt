Rumble;

Thank you for apologizing. It takes an honorable person to publicly do than
and I accept it. I have read in this NG and a couple of forums about people
buying/sell accounts with high level characters on them. I couldn't do that,
no fun or learning getting there when doing that. The problem I'm having is
getting into the XP grind. Go get in a group, pull, kill, pull, kill.  I'm
not learning a lot of the minor details of the game.  This is my own fault
and I am going to break that cycle. Like many I guess, I keep
thinking....."2 more levels and I get those really neat spells".... However,
the problem with this is as I progress in levels is I don't REALLY know how
to use some item, or spell at the proper moment, or how does this work, as
in this question I posted here.  When in a group and maybe during a med
break, I'll ask a question like this one and the one's that bother to answer
says ...." I don't know my character doesn't need that, or I'm a newbie to,
and don't know...."  Then I'll go and try to research it and not find
"exactly" the answer and come here looking for it by posting a question.  I
figure if I don't know the answer, someone else doesn't either, and there is
such a Great pool of knowledge and talent that posts here.

Level 36 or not, I still consider myself a newbie, until the time that I can
answer "how to" questions.

If you ever make a character on the Nameless server look me up. You get free
rez's for life, LOL.

Take Care

Now level 38 Cleric
