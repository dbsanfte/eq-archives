fire elemental gives you a 16 point DS.
water elemental gives you enduring breath.
earth elemental gives you a 10 str buff (wish i had known that while
carrying around 3250gp)
illusion tree makes you kinda like a druid, but without the smell.
drybone gives a decent fire resist buff (25).
imp gives levitate and a fire resist buff of 15.
spirit wolf gives an atk and cold resist buff.

check out the spell lists at eq.crgaming.com.  if you limit the
enchanter's list to divination, you weed out all but a few of the spells
that aren't illusions.

i think all the rest were mentioned in previous posts.

Meerina - 42 Ranger of Tunare
Mystarr - 40 Enchanter of Himself
Amalena - 26 Druid of Tunare
