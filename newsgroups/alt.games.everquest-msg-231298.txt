Well, the xp penalty for death used to be double what it is now... and I 
remember the scandal the reduction caused amongst the hardcore, and the 
complaints about Verant "dumbing down" the game... plus ï¿½a change...

Also, root used to overwrite snare, which wasn't a whole lot of fun for 
us Druids. Necro lifetaps were completely unresistable, which led to 
gangs of lowbie-ass necros taking down Hill Giants.
