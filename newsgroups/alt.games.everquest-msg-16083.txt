Well, after six levels of hunting in Crystal Caverns, my monk can now
actually afford a tink bag (5603pp in the bank right now)!  So much for a
monk always being poor!  Of course, I shouldn't spout off about CC, 'cause
it will get as crowded as LOIO! :-) In my stay there I got tons of gems,
words, runes, a BCR, foreman's skull cap, chipped velium amulet, crystalline
belt, and two Ry'Gorr Oracle Cloaks.  I can technically stay there through
level 45, but I doubt I will.. I do want to grind through 40 killing blue
orcs, though.

The other nice thing is that I joined a really fantastic guild over the
weekend (dropped my old guild a few weeks ago). They are an older, well
established guild, with many people over 50. When I did my first /who all
GUILD, I was the lowest person online, except for a couple low level alts.
Cool!  And they aren't "uber" or obnoxious. Several people have high level
enchanters and have offered to go buy the bag for me. Saves me trying to get
my lowly lizard CHA of 55 up to something reasonable.

Hopefully I'll get my bag in the new few days.. 10-slots.. extra large..
100% weight reducing.. <drool>

PS - I'm starting to understand the twinking thing a little better.. selling
in EC is SO annoying. But, I stuck with it.
