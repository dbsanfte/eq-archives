Go to your local EB store and ask them for EverQuest. They should have a few
copies of Triology laying about, and also Shadow's of Luclin (They are the
only store based stockist in the UK that has it). You may have to leave your
name and number with them to give them a ring back (I know our EB is sold
out atm of anything EverQuestish).

Get the Triology and perhaps Luclin (It is an add-on). The Triology consists
of the original EQ plus the two older expansions: Kunark and Velious. Luclin
has a new graphic engine... but is apparenly VERY computer instense, so you
might want to wait with that one for a bit.
