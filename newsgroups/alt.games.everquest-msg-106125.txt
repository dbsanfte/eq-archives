  If you're asking what "UI" stand for, "user interface."  What we use to
play the game.  Verant said that with the release of Luclin, we'd be getting
a newer, better UI (the current one is pretty bad, REALLY bad if you don't
have Velious).  The site I linked to explains in a little more depth, but
they don't say much about what features will be present with the new UI.
