I never said I expected anyone to work for "minimum wage", and please
don't try to twist my words into something they were not. 

What I said, in my original post was that a "fair" profit was to be
expected. Fair being substantially different than minimal. 

Just because you don't like my opinion is no reason to get snippy. 

Accept that I feel differently about this than you do and move on.
