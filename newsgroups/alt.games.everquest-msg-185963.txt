I got an e-mail from Stevie with a follow-up question on fixing your True
Spirit faction for the wizard quest. It made me realize it wasn't posted 
here and maybe some other people were confused on the same issue.

If you are doing the first part of the shammy epic with a chanter 
friend, you can NOT charm the NPC in North Freeport to turn in the small 
gem and get the TS faction bump. (Ok, you *can* charm him, but you won't 
get the faction hit.)

This was nerfed a long time ago. You can talk to a charmed mob about 
quests (assuming the charmed faction is good enough) and you can turn in 
and receive items, but if they are charmed you will not get any 
associated faction change from the transaction.

For this quest, you'll need to open the trade window to give the small 
gem to the barbarian shaman but have the enchanter invis you before you 
hit "give". This will result in the faction bump you are looking for.

If you keep checking your non-invis faction on the mobs, once you reach 
indifferent on your own you can do these parts of the quest without any 
charming or invising and keep going as high as you like from there. 
(i.e. no Enchanter required from that point on.)

Oh, and be sure to tip your enchanter. :-) That's a pain in the ass 
service for them to do just to get your faction up.
