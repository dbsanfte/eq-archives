had a similiar problem when I played post beta, but attribute it to two
things.
slow computer ( the speed of your computer effects your movement - so much
so my guy would skip in game, ROFL )  and that sprint has a delay on it, so
you would have to trigger it and wait a few seconds before you would
actually start running.  If you wait until your almost dead you have almost
no chance of escaping at all, even with full stamina.  Once you do get some
distance from the critter, you gotta also hit sprint to turn it off, or you
could suddenly slow down so much from losing all your stamina the critter
catches up.

I think I prefer EQ's way of running over DAOC's.  51st plus get to put
skill points in it.  less micromanagement.
