Stay out of Kelethin.  Don't think you'll ever get good enough faction 
to walk around there.  No reason for you to really be in that town, you 
can't get in the bank due to your size.  You can't get in most of the 
merchant buildings for the same reason.
If you are looking for a nice safe place to level up at low levels, I 
suggest going to Shadeweaver's Thicket instead.  You don't have to worry 
about the cat guards killing you like the woodelfs.  And I feel that the 
xp is much better there.  Around level 8 or so you can go in Paludal 
Caverns and kill bugs and shrooms, careful tho, the bugs are social. 
Lots of fast xp in Shadeweaver and Paludal.
