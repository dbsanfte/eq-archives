Taras does a FAQ and posts it here regularly. Of course, as with any
group, the ones who most often *should* read it are the ones least
likely to, but that's a reflection on them, not on Taras' efforts.

For some reason, though, some of us (like me) have not been seeing
Taras' posts lately, just the replies to them. You might be a victim
of that same weirdness. You might want to do a Google search for the
FAQ.
