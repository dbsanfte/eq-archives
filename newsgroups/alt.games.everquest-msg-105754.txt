1 Item change and a "Fungi-Rumor" leads to "The Sky is
Falling!!!!"..."Verant Hates high level players!!"

<sigh>

Did ever occur to you that Verant has finally gotten around to
balancing the low level game? Part of that balancing may include
changes to Uber-Twink items. The best part of the balancing is the
revamps of old world newbie zones. (Misty, Nektulous)

Since the recent "lowbie" changes went into effect I have started 3
new characters (two are casters--I swore I would never play another
due to the old book-med), and I am rediscovering the low level fun of
EQ. I don't feel compelled to PL or twink, because the level 1-5
bat/bug bashing only takes an hour or two. 

The changes Verant has made entice and encourage me to start new
characters (Next project is a Halfling Pal/Ran in the new Misty). I am
hooked all over again!
