EQ took good & bad idea from previous games.  DAOC took good & bad ideas
from previous games, including EQ.

I see nothing wrong with EQ taking a good idea after the fact from DAOC.
DAOC does conning better.  Grey is EQ green, green is EQ blue, blue is blue,
yellow is EQ white/black; orange is EQ yellow (actually it may simply mean
level+1, unlike EQ at higher levels).  Red is higher EQ yellow and purple is
EQ red.

They added one color to the lower end...I don't think it's inconceivable
that they'll get around to adding at least one color above as well.

BTW, for pharmers such as Bizbee and many others, TLC is very much alive in
DAOC.
