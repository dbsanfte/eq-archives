You've gotten other suggestions, and I hope you're already set up. But
if not......
As suggested, make absolutely sure that you are entering the correct
number. As I recall, in addition to the registration key, there's a UPC
sort of number on the case/box someplace, as well as some license
number. If you are definitely using the correct one, then ensure that
you've tried all combinations of the "mixable" characters (e.g. the zero
and "o", the five and the "s", the one and the "l"). If all that fails,
you may have to ask Tech Support for a new key. I had to when I ordered
mine. That brings up my question. Specifically which message are you
getting? "Invalid" or "Key already in use"?  If it's the former, then
tech support may definitely be able to help you. If the latter, you'll
need to fax/e-mail them a picture of your CD case with the number
visible, and they can give you a new number to register with. They did
it for me, because mine was "already in use".
