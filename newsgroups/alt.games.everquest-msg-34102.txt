AHAH yeah, thing is it was sort of true I think. Well, the bixies
dying did not CAUSE the griffons to spawn but they shared the same
spawn table with other stuff possibly as far as players could tell.
Things do often share spawn tables so this was probably not far from
the truth. However, as a druid TRYING to make griffons spawn via
killing bixies I had no luck.
