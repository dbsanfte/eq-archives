I've been up there, according to some other guy's post here there was
something with a shelf that ported you to higher floors in the tower.
I've clicked practically everything north of the "bridge" and hailed every
damn npc. No luck. Either this is a hoax, or I have simply mis-clicked some
hidden section of a wall.

I did discover some hidden room in the casters study with a quest npc, who
apparently wants something (couldn't get anything out of him other then him
asking me if I wanted something from him) for a quest... I hope.

The newbie-robes (like the +1 mana thing) now have some upgraded versions
with the most expensive one even +1 int and some mana !  Too costly to be of
use (150pp for a +1 int robe), but it's nice to have a caster variant of the
"normal" weapons and armor at the Norrathian vendors.


Anyway, I have not found the research only spells, but the Luclin spells
themselves are usually pretty sweet by themselves. My lvl 49 summoned
Shoulder/back item has a whopping 15fr, 15cr and 15mr on it, which is more
then any other item in my inventory and a great boon for most raid
encounters.
(OT: My group had to do a CR in seb yesterday and I decked the paladin who
lost his corpse in full plate on all visible slots, shoulder item, 2 rings,
shield, and a modrod to fight with. He was doing damage, bashing and could
even sustain a couple of hits. He looked great in the shiny red as well
