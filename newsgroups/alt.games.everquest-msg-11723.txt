    Where I DID 35 was in Cazic Thule, helping a friend get his Ravenscale.
Fairly slow XP, although had we done Pools it would have been better. Also
did 35 wandering all over the place (Paw, GD, Unrest, Sol A/B, even
Runnyeye) with my rogue, and my monk is finishing up 35 soloing at the FM
giant fort.

    Where would I go, if I had to do it again? Lower Guk. You being KOS have
a choice of two zones to hunt without faction issues, and the pulls are
plentiful. Get a healer, and a snarer, and you have the basis of a zone
group. If trains get too bad, there's likely still a few places in Upper you
can go for XP.

PS. For the record - 35 to 40 LGuk, 40 to 52 Sol B (with level 44 being
entirely solo in Kaesora), 52 to 54 Karnor's, 55 plus Sebilis. There were
some other places along the way, but that's where the bulk of the XP was
earned. Karnor's is about as outdoors as this dwarf could handle.
