Are you doing it for skilling up, or for profit?  Regardless, most people
who do make high end player crafted armor for profit, and find themselves
short on padding will not blink at paying 100 plat for it.  It is such an
insignificant amount compared to the profit that can be obtained.

Personally, I am cheap, and I farm just about everything that I need when
working on tradeskills.  I buy the things that I cannot get myself.  I do
know a number of folks that do some of the high end smithed armor, and
paying 100pp for a padding for one of those pieces is a mere drop in the
bucket.
