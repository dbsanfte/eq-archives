My Paladin has been killed there twice, despite good faction
with the druids.

Both happened this way:

  1.  I sat down to meditate at the druid rings.
  2.  A wandering bear saw me sitting, figured me for easy
      prey, and attacked me (bears and many other mobs will
      do this no matter how high your level might be -- if
      you sit, they get overconfident).
  3.  The druids at the ring saw me "fighting" with a bear
      (the fact that I hadn't even hit back at the bear
      in self defense was immaterial), and all came running
      over to beat the snot out of me for endangering one
      of their animal friends.  Or maybe they were just
      pitching in to help the bear try to eat me.

And both times, after my own death, things proceeded
to one more step:

  4.  The druids then noticed that my friend and groupmate,
      a Bard, had been singing a mana-regeneration song,
      so they then attacked *HER* and killed her for
      "assisting" me in my "fight" with the bear...

Moral of the story:  If you're going to sit or meditate
after porting into NK, do it AFTER you've moved a safe
distance from the druid ring.  And if you're a Bard,
either don't sing for your party near the rings, or
make sure everyone in your group knows not to sit down.
