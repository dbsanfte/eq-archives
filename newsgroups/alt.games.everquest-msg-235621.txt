   I dunno about that.  I mean, if he is serious, and if he is as big of a
control freak as my spidey sense is telling me he is, then the pictures make
perfect sense.  Let's say he gets some desperate bimbo(s?) to take him up on his
offer.  Then, the lady/ladies say that they are ready to move on.  He would have
perfect ammunition to fire back with something along the lines of "What?  I was
perfectly honest from the start!  I even showed nude pictures of myself, of
*this* scrawny body on the internet!  You lied!" and then I can see it going
downhill fast from there.

   One of the most disconcerting thing to me about the picture is not his body
(looking at naked pictures of mine on the internet wouldn't be a  very pleasant
experience for most people either).  Rather, it's his face.  He never cracks a
smile.  He always, in every shot, has a very intense look going.  Very serious.

   I think he is serious.   /shiver
