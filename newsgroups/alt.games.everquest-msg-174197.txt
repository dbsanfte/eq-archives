Interesting discussion in guild chat today.  We were talking about how we
haven't had many events lately, because a lot of people haven't been
playing.  Our guild leader has been talking to leaders of other guilds that
are similar to ours (no attendence or play time requirements, most people in
the 54-60 range, with a few under and a few over), and he said they've all
had quite an attendence drop off since PoP.

Some factors seem to be:

1. People in the military getting shipped out.

2. The PoP tiers and flag system has caused a split in many guilds.  Because
we are a casual guild with people from all over the world, it generally
takes nearly everyone on at a given time to do a raid.  With half the guild
wanting to go off and do zones they've been flagged for, and the other half
not flagged or too low level for those zones, there just aren't any places
that interest everyone.

3. Rising system requirements.  One of our main Clerics cannot get the new
UI to work on his computer, for example.  He's out for now.

4. A general feeling that before PoP, the end was in site...work up to 60,
start doing AA, and then have fun 'cause you are done leveling.  Now there
are 5 more levels.  This seems to have discouraged a lot of people.

Anyone else seeing anything like this?
