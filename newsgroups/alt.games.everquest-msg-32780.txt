And see what exactly? A caster trying to get root off? Ok so MY back is 
turned on the mob to keep you in sight and see if the root is sticking? 
Thanks but no thanks. I'll watch your HP bar if you don't mind. Or 
better yet WHY NOT SAY SOMETHING. HELP is four letters.

Duh. But you seemed to indicate that YOU shouldn't have to root. Maybe 
another caster DID and you're getting beat on. Does this take away from 
YOUR responsibility to (as you put it) "pay attention"? Don't tell me it 
hasn't happened because I've SEEN it happen.

No, I'm not. You seem to think it's the tanks one and only job to 
babysit the casters. If the casters cannot control aggro then they WILL 
be beat on and it's not entirely the fault of the tank (as your original 
post seemed to indicate). You seemed to have glossed over casters aggro 
management and laid it at the feet of the tanks.

Sure there is. You can play smart. You can snare. You can choose the 
correct camp spot. You can do MANY things to minimize the chances of 
multi-adds. Just because YOU think it's dull does NOT mean that you 
should take less responsibility for your actions.

Personally, I don't consider taunting a mob off a caster crowd control. 
Just my opinion though. And yes, MOST of the time I'll wait for a help 
call. IF I see their HP bar draining rapidly I WILL taunt off them. I 
never said I just let them die. If you consider that crowd control then 
so be it.

True enough. I agree with you here. Maybe if your original post had said 
it this way we wouldn't have a problem. But the way you indicated it was 
the tanks PRIMARY job to drop everything and immediately taunt off the 
casters. While this is true up to a point the casters must also manage 
their own aggro. If they let the tanks build up aggro and things go sour 
and I need a heal, go ahead and I'll taunt it off you. But if things are 
manageable and you go ahead and draw aggro, I'm NOT gonna switch targets 
till you tell me you're in trouble.

And that's fine. That's the way they play. I play MY way. We do hold 
some similar views on this. I don't think I totally disagree with your 
post. I mostly disagree with how you said it. You seemed to indicate 
that a tanks only job is to babysit the casters. While this is true, you 
didn't point out that the caster has some responsibility in aggro 
management that SHOULD make it a moot point. If this is what you were 
trying to convey then we agree. If not then we'll agree to disagree.
