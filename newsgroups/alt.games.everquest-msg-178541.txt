Rangers do not get Panic Animal until L22, the OP is L18.

To the OP:  In Paludal Caverns (Luclin) you could do well if you were
able to find a group.  Do not fight the P? P? Fiends unless you are
grouped with somebody who can cast Cure Disease.  PC is pretty popular,
so playing odd hours where server pop is low might actually make it
easier for you to find a group there.  If you prefer to solo (or have
no choice), the various Beetles in North Karana could provide you with
steady experience (no loot to speak of tho), some caution is required
to solo in NK, but being non-KOS to most/all of the animals makes it
fairly easy for Druid or Ranger to solo there.  And in East Karana there
are quite a few mobs blue to you, again caution is advised while you are
learning the zone.  One note relevant to both NK and EK:  the various
griffawns/griffennes/griffons are significant undercons as far as their
melee strength goes, if it cons blue it will likely eat you in melee.
If you want to kill griffs with a Ranger expect to have to do much of
the killing with your bow (and it'll take lots of arrows).
