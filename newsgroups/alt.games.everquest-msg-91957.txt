Yes. Tradeskills only check for a raise upon success. Thus, the more 
successes you have the more chances for a skill raise. Ideally, you should 
be doing the lowest item that is not trivial.

It is MUCH easier to keep current than to catcxh up, especially if you are 
20 or more points behind your max. Add to this the fact that you only get 
skill ups fighting exp-giving mobs.

Welll, I waited to 20 to get my 1hb weapon... and MAN does it suck. Only 
train it in a group ands slowly it will inch up.
