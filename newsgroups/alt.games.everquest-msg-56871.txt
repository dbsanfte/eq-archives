Dreadlands

This information is totally incorrect. I used group teleport to GD all the
time and do not have the tooth, the people go on their merry way, and I go
kill HGs with no zoning, no instant movement to another location, etc. Also,
your comment about Dreadlands is confusing... what do you mean DL is like
that? there is no key or tooth required to port to DL, so I have no idea
what you mean.
