Speaking for myself, I experimented with numerous classes up til levels 8-10
before deciding on my Ranger. I would suggest you do the same as it will
give you a chance to learn about the games  geography, mechanics, interface
etc.... as well as the benefits and downsides to the various classes.

In the end though... play the character you enjoy playing, not what others
consider "uber". People will tell you that "Wizards" suck, or "Paladins"
suck, etc... Ignore them and enjoy whatever class you decide upon.
