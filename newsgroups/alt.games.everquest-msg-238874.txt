Yes, I do like Tom's, and I must have overlooked that page, so thank you. 
:)

But how about an explanation of how the chips differ, and some of the 
weird-ass terms used?  I really have no idea what makes an Nvidia NV30 
different from an NV35, or why I should care if it has 4xFSAA or 
8xanisotropic filtering?  Anyone got a good glossary?  How much should I 
care if a card is 'Ultra' or not?  Does that just mean it comes 
pre-overclocked, when I could theoretically overclock a non-ultra card 
myself?

Hmm... maybe I should crosspost to comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.video...
