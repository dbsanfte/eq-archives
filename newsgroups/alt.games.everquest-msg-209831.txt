Oh, and I forgot to add here that the idea is for you to upgrade out of your
gear, expansion or no expansion.  Get an item at level 10, replace it at 15,
replace that one at 20, so on and so forth.  If your gear got better, you
wouldn't want to improve it; that would take away one of the carrots that the
game is driven by.  Newer, better, shinier, there should always be something out
in front of you that wasn't within your reach before but is now, or will be if
you push.

Having constructed the game that way, and without item decay, a nasty side
effect showed up; "mudflation".  That is to say, people discarding old gear
don't value it as much as they did when getting it in the first place.  I may
buy an item for 100pp, then 10 levels later happily sell it for 50pp, or even
for 20pp, just to cash it in at all; I don't need to get the 100pp I originally
spent back, and probably won't, both because of deflation but also because I'm
not willing to spend the time and effort it would take to get that high price.

As people level up and more and more good items flood into the game, with little
ever leaving it, items which were once expensive and amazingly good for a given
level become cheaper and also less amazing

Efforts have been made to combat this; the "no drop" flag is one, now you get an
item thats an upgrade and that old no drop item you had in its slot can't be
passed down to lower levels via twinking or selling, its just useless.
"Reccomended level" and "required level" flags on items mean that they are of
limited use or even are useless for lower levels, preserving some of the value
of the lower level items.  Experimentally, with the introduction of Warrens,
they tried to introduce a "trivial loot code" so that it would be impossible for
high level characters to come in and "farm" items off green to them mobs to
flood the market with, this was rumored to be planned as a standard for all SOL
zones, but open rebellion among the players forced a halt to this, the TLC now
survives only on Firiona Vie, and even there its been circumvented by raid code,
if you have POK and at least one friend or bot you can get TLC drops off level
one mobs while you are level 65.

Personally, I think the designers did miss a trick here, which would be an
upgrade path for those old quest armors and so forth.  Yes, they are junky for
the effort it takes to get them compared to what you can pick up for a song in
the bazaar now... but if there were quests for better gear more in keeping with
the values of things in our time, that required this gear as a basis, I think
you'd see people pursuing it still.  Look at the various Vah Shir newbie quests,
or the shawl quest and ring quest series in Thurgadin, where you keep handing in
one item to recieve a better one, the mechanisms to do this are certainly
already in place.  The other benefit of this approach would be that you would
see those old items leaving the pool, instead of going back into circulation to
degrade the value of even lowlier gear (bronze armor, anyone?)
