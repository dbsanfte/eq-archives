In fact, I went ahead and did it myself.  I even gave your contention an
advantage by putting all points into stamina for the warrior, whereas
there's a school of thought that suggests that a ranger may want to put poin
ts into other attributes, so I put some into STR, DEX and WIS in addition to
STA for the ranger, even more penalized compared to the warrior since the
ranger didn't have as many points to distribute at the beginning.  Here are
my results:

Half Elf Warrior - 105 Stamina - 34 hit points
Half Elf Ranger - 89 Stamina - 30 hit points

Now I also took the liberty of creating an Ogre warrior with the maximum
number of stamina points allowed at character creation, just for a
comparison.  Keep in mind that the difference between the ogre warrior and
the half elf ranger is not a perfectly good comparison, because race
contributes a great deal to the difference, not class, which means it's a
race balance rather than class balance issue.  This was the result:

Ogre Warrior - 150 Stamina - 38 hit points.

Not entirely an insignificant difference in this respect, but hardly the
difference you've been claiming.  Perhaps I'll make an Ogre Shadowknight and
see what the difference is there, since you've also made that claim.
