Hi all,

I dont think they just started listening .... they are just clever ;-)

They kept a few necessary/good improvements for another expansion to make
even more money .... everyone that does tradeskills will love it because of
the improved bankcapacity ...

And why it will come out short after PoP ? Hm, the new following game is in
sight and they want to make all the money out of EQ they can ...

New zones ? ... hm, hope they will work out better ones than eg Jaggedpine,
but I think they might introduce then very good items there too, everyone
that want to have "normal" items then has to buy the expansion (think about
spell hasteII/manapres II items in PoP for example, or of course the new
spells).

But if we would be SOE we would act the same way =)

Dont know what special abilities the new race Froglocs will have but think
it will be interesting ;-)

I think I will buy it (even if the bankcapacity would be the only thing
improved ;-)), only hope they will make the download one package so you can
burn it on CD to make reinstallations easier ...

Have fun in game

Christian
