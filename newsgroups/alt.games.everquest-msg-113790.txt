That's all fine and good if you don't want to learn how to function in a
dungeon or raid.  I had to learn the hard way, when I could finally group
with my guild, and they took me to LGuk.  OP should learn dungenons, and
make them her second nature.  Runnyeye, or the Gorge are good places for
her.

Bah, the lower level guilds are where all the fun is.  If I had to join an
uber guild, I would have quit this game long ago.  Any guild that tries to
put more restaints on my time than my job does are cordially invited to
enter into intercourse with themselves.
