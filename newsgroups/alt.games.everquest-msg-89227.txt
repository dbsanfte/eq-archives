Dumb question--I hear people talk about certain zones like High Hold
Pass where someone wants to join a group but all the groups already
have the maximum six people so they get put on a "list".  Is there an
actual game function where you get your name put on a "list" and you
get a message saying when there is a group opening, or is it just an
unofficial thing that players do (you ask somebody in a group to send
you a tell when somebody in their group has left and there's an
opening in that group, or somebody will /ooc that there is a spot
available in their group)?

Thanks in advance,
