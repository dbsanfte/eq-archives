Actually saw something even worse on Lanys the other day:

Seems a guy was bound on the RM side of the RM/LR zoneline.
He musta not known about the event, because he just stood
there after logging on (Probably went AFK while waiting for
zone to load or something). Anyway, the inevitable train came
along, a buncha drakes and horsies and whatnot. He died in
seconds, the mobs would start heading back in the general
direction of the Gypsy Camp, he'd repop IN AGGRO RANGE, and
get killed again. And again. And again...

A side-effect was that the zoneline NEVER became safe, so
people who zoned in were beset by the killer krew. A lot of
naked high elf corpses later, he musta return to the keyboard,
stared in horror at the carnage, and pulled the plug. Being a
cleric, I'd periodically check to see if he was online while I
and another cleric rezzed like mad, but he never came on =(
The area around the zoneline was covered in corpses that night.
( I should know, I was some of them =)

Lanys is still down? AUUUUGHHH!
