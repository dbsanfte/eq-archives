Hi Dick;

What a great idea for some uses, especially the practice casting use.

So far I have programmed 14 buttons with various items. I have it set to go
to Hotbutton pages 1-4. , my AA abilities, quick camera view and back to
first person, and several key messages I frequently use. I've started with
just these to see how much I would use the pad and how convenient it is to
use. I must admit, so far I'm really liking it. I'm finding it's easier and
quicker for me so far. I think that over time and practice with the
speedpad, I will come up with more items for it to do. One thing I like is
that if I come up with something, I can window out of EQ, program a button,
reload the profile and window back in and it is in effect. That way I can
adjust something or just plain try something new without the major headache
of logging off, program it, and logging back on.

Thank you and the others for a quick response.
