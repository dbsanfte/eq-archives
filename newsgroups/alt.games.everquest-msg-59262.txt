Mostly it looks like a bonanza for the monks and bards, but some of
these look intriguing.... for instance:

I'd definitely take this one, no matter how small the speed of recovery
increase.

Interesting. Limited use, but interesting.

This is *definitely* going to be on every warrior's wish list.
Particularly good for those times when an add with no hits/taunts on it
decides to jump on one of the casters for no damn reason. Grrr.

That could add to the area taunt. Nice.

I predict this will be a default skill look for by warriors.

Sweeeeeeeeeeeet!

Nice.

VERY NICE!

With no experience with horses as yet, it's hard to picture what this
entails, but it certainly sounds cool if only from a graphics and RP
standpoint. I'm guessing it's for SKs and not Necros, though. :-(
 
> Fearless - This ability makes the player permanently immune to fear spells.

That's got to be a typo. "Permanently" immune? Or maybe just for the
length of this melee session, maybe? Permanently sounds a little too
good to be true.

Ummmm..... so you die? Or do you just drop unconcious and hope nothing
hit's you until you regen a point?

Fine. Put some of the necros out of business. (Harrumph). No, seriously,
that's a pretty cool skill and I doubt everyone will have it.
 
> Mass Fear - Allows the player to cast an AE low resist fear spell.

I can see where this could turn deadly in a dungeon fast. This should be
interesting to watch it get incorporated into people's normal gameplay
routines.

Sounds dangerous to use, but devistating when pulled off. Sweet.

Ok. Now *that's* just too funny. "RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! JABOBER'S GONNA
BLOW!!!!"

Huh? Nexus? Isn't that a type of shampoo?

Betcha that get's nerfed in a hurry.

I've long thought this should be in the game.

Same as the last comment.

OUTSTANDING for dungeon work!
 
Nice skills. It should be interesting.
