Hmmm... I've already encountered something like this, when trying to 
cast rez for example... I'll have just crossed the boundary according to 
my mana bar, and i stand and poof insufficient mana, and then my mana 
number drops 10 or 20 points... resyncing obviously.

However in this case its only out of sync by a tics worth, so its rarely 
a big deal. (Although its extremely frustrating when it -is- a big 
deal.)

At any rate, a much simpler test than the one you suggest would be to 
dry up your mana pool, and then sit-stand dance and see how long it 
takes you to get to -full- (when you are full cast a level 1 5 mana 
spell to force a resync and confirm you were actually full.), and then 
do it again and sit the whole time. Time both tests from 0 to full.

If the server is allocating mana in real time, the time to complete the 
first test should be nearly 30-50% longer than the second test, as I am 
standing 50% of the time in the first test and getting only "2-5/tic" 
instead of "20-30/tic" or whatever I'm at for a given character.

Or is there a flaw you see with this test?

That begs 4 questions:

1) It happens relatively reliably, and as a late night player I'm 
skeptical that its really internet dispruption. (Which is what it 
appears you are suggesting... high ping, latency spike, lost packets, 
etc) 

2) I do often pull mobs with proximity (getting close enough and waiting 
for them to aggro (ie when I've run out of arrows or other ranged 
attacks, but want to maintain as much distance as possible so that I'm 
not getting hit instantly...) and they do routinely take up to 2-5 
seconds to come at me. Which suggests that aggro is not being checked 
instantaneously. Given that I've moved into aggro range and stopped, I'd 
expect the server to have good up to date position info. (This seems 
confirmed by your own description of how movement data is updated).

3) Unless the packets are outright -lost- why wouldn't the server still 
receive them and and process aggro on them unless they were seriously 
outdated or out of order. ( I mean, if I send x1,y1.... and then the 
server gets x2,y2 and x3,y3 together 3 seconds later sure x3,y3 is 
already out of range again... but why not process x2,y2 for aggro and 
activate the mob, especially if x2, y2 is smack dab in the middle of a 
stationary unengaged mobs aggro range...?)

4) Similiarly but from the -other- side of the coin. Consider me being 
stationary for an extended period of time. We can assume the server has 
good accurate position data on me. When a mob wanders up, it will 
frequently get right on top of me and or even pass me before aggroing. 
Given the server has accurate position data on both an unengaged mob and 
a stationary player there is no reason for this to occur unless aggro is 
only checked periodically.

I did immediately discount it at first, but then, as rpgexpert allows 
people to 'comment' on the article I expected an explosion of "WTF are 
you smoking" comments... but instead it was largely... "hey great 
article"... and that's what prompted me to want to verify this. I can 
see one guy spouting nonense... but usually it gets shot down fast, or 
at the very least its gets disputed.

PS
I also noted you didn't address my observations with bard buffs 
simultaneously wearing off (which shouldn't even be possible!!) Mezzes 
and DSes in particular as the effects of them wearing off more are 
visceral than simply some stat number display changes).
