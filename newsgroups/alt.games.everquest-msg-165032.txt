No, but you can't say you've never heard that as a reason a druid, shammy,
ranger, or bard -need- J-Boots (which usually get MQ sold by said classes).
Granted, bards have a very good reason to want to be able to SoW, since
their casting ability rises about 50% if they don't have to twist Selos
while kiting.  Still, T-boots are perfectly fine for them, since the ability
to cast on the run is part of the bard's code, regardless of item.
