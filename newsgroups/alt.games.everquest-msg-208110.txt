Yes, thats a worthwhile soloing technique.. but hardly relevant when 
being PLed via porcupine, is it?  No, the DS won't do its work, with two 
AE stuns you can provide the equivalent of 60% slowing, meaning the DS 
does only about a third its normal DPS.  If you are being PLed via this 
method, it makes no sense to reduce the DPS, you are just prolonging the 
time per kill.

Mez is great, dont' get me wrong.  Its the "until 20+_" part that I 
defend.  Whats to stop her from learning this task well at 24 instead of 
at 16? 

Remember, I'm saying this from the perspective of having just leveled up 
from 1 to 30 in the past few weeks, NOT PLed (twinked a bit, but not 
PLed), soloing and grouping.  And from the perspective of having run a 
cleric to 65 ( if you think a cleric doesn't know how important mez is, 
think again) and a bard to 57 (very rarely with a chanter in group, so 
-as- mezzer quite frequently).  

But sub 20, the mobs are, frankly, wimps, and every member of your party 
can probably tank a mob as well as any other, and is eager to 
demonstrate that point.  They are also pretty easy to single pull, and 
are rarely casters, which means root is a perfectly good mez substitute 
most of the time, one that doesnt break if someone decides to hit the 
wrong mob.

I'll fully support your boycott on anyone who doesn't know how to mez by 
level 30... but by 20?  Its just a toy still by then!

Mez for splitting is sooo old school.  Get the memo, they fixed Lull.  
My cleric can single pull better than someone using mez to do the job; a 
mob that isn't mad at you won't socialize with his buddies when he wakes 
up.  If I want to mez pull, its like this:  Pull two or more, mez on 
arrival (where they won't do any harm when they wake up) then tap 
whichever one you like on the shoulder to start the killing.   But I'd 
just as soon get just one most of the time, so I don't have to waste 
mana or worry about possible resists and so forth.  Post 20, multiple 
pulling techniques start to become interesting, post 40 they start to 
become crucial to maintaining high speed killing... but teenagers don't 
really need to worry about those advanced techniques yet, even though 
they do have the tools; among other concerns, the rising tide of higher 
mana regen (and larger pool) hasn't hit them yet, those spells are still 
-expensive- relative to their effect at those levels.

Mez plus mem blur, instead of lulling in the first place?  You really 
want to make chanters swear off pulling like in the bad old days?

With others of like level the targets you are going after don't require 
MR reduction yet.  This is central to my thesis; at low levels, mobs 
(even low reds) don't resist enough to be worth tashing.  As you level 
up, this changes, because the game is designed so that mobs become 
harder in every way as you level up faster than PC's increase in 
power.   A level 10 can stick things to an untashed level 14 mob, while 
a level 50 will have real trouble sticking things to an untashed level 
51 mob.

Now if you are grouped with people of widely varied levels, -then- tash 
is helpful at low levels.  If you are grouped with higher levels, going 
after their mobs you will need to tash to land your own spells.  If you 
are grouped with lower levels, tash will help them land on the "your 
level" mobs which are high level to them.

The range part is handy, of course, as is the fact that like cancel 
magic (a spell my cleric used to pull with before getting to MOR/MOK 
levels) its very low aggro, and will often let you cherry pick unlulled 
mobs from right next to their neighbors

But Alacrity is level 24, so pre 24, you won't be learning anything 
about which haste to cast.. you can cast quickness or you can just sort 
of wave your hands at them and say "hit faster".  As for letting the 
melee go unhasted, if your group is pulling so many mobs so consistently 
that you can't keep them hasted because you are busy with CC, you need a 
new puller.  Haste means faster damage which means mobs die faster which 
means they do less damage.  Mobs dying faster and saving healer mana at 
the same time, I can't think of a more important job in the long run, 
Mez is for emergencies, mez as a multipull stacking plan is for adding 
efficiency... but if it means you can't keep hastes running, then its 
-not- adding efficiency after all, rework the plan.

Now you -could- tell me that these lasts points are things to learn, but 
I don't see what prevents you learning them at 24 with a group of 
friends who know you have been PLed to that point instead of figuring 
them out as you move from 16 to 24 (remember, there is no haste before 
16, so you won't be learning about it at all prior to that point)

This is the one point I begrudingly ceeded to the "don't PL a chanter to 
24" side, it would be nice to have those earlier levels to start the 
"who, what, when, why, and how" of slowing seeping into your bones.  
Again, though, recall that this chanter will be joining a group of other 
24s who will understand that she's inexperienced, not being released 
into the wild after a day in PLing captivity.
