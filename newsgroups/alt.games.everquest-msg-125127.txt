I always wondered what happened to them.

As for their new sound turning people away, I guess you have to consider
that many people like Brittany Spears, Backstreet Boys, and other bands that
make me want to kill myself with a shoe horn... so it's not like they have
good tastes to begin with. :b

I spent a little time looking for them, but I haven't gotten terribly good
results. Would you happen to know the album titles?
