Ack that is a huge difference.  I thought he had a point of law, in that
she could not by definition "know" that they would kill the woman and so
can't be guilty of murder.  If he based his decision on that point, that
it was not possible for her to "know" in a legally defined manner what
would happen so she can not be guilty of murder, which is what I thought
he was saying, then while I don't like it I can understand.  On the
other hand if what you say is fact, that his decision was based on his
believing her testimony regarding what she knew and didn't know then he
jumped off the bench and into the jury box.  That part was done, he was
just there to pass sentence, what he believes shouldn't enter into it at
that point.  Sounds like a Simpsons episode and a "writ of boys will be
boys" was declared.  Ah well, karma will get her in the end, maybe she
will get a large militant lesbian roommate in jail <eg>.
