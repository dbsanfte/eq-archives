Gak, my necro is an Errudite so I can't really help you on this bit.

Humm I picked up a "dagger" for 2pp, and haven't upgraded yet, but then
I'm doing it all wrong.

At my mighty level 9 I fight sometimes and just cast sometimes.
Buffing and healing the pet helps, but generally I am still keeping
agro, then stpping back (letting pet take agro) to cast. This seems to
work ok atm.
Each time you get a new pet you suddenly feal like you are it's pet for
a while :-P

I have avoided fear so far partly due to my hunting location (see below)
and partly due to the number of resists and low duration. I find it more
effective just to mix it up. This may not be optimal.

I have leveled from 6 to 9 in the warrens, almost exclusivly solo. level
6 was *not* easy. I died 5 times, but 7 - 9 I only died a further 5
times, and the corpse run is trivial. <G>
I'm not sure about soloing much further in, but the entrace and first
rooms on each side can be done easily. 
And the loot is superb.

Is that the only way to stop you playing ?
