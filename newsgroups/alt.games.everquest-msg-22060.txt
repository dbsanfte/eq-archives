It's usually 1.5 times the lowest level, so your level 9 friend
would have to be level 10 before he could get exp grouped with you.

At lower levels, where 1.5 times is less than a 5-level
difference, the allowable span is 5 levels.

The reason this rule exists is so that, for example, level 40
players can't group with their level 10 friends and share HUGE
amounts of experience (relative to the level 10 character)
by killing level 33 monsters while the level 10 person sits
back safely and watches, doing nothing.  If this were allowed,
low level players could skyrocket in levels with no effort
whatsoever.

That's the "real" reason, but the "roleplay" reason is that
when a low-level character "helps" a high-level character kill
things, the high-level character is doing all the work, and
the low-level character really doesn't learn anything from
the adventure.
