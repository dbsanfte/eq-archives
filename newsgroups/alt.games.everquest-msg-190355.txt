Druid is best no doubt, the real question is whos number 2? 

Heres my candidate, a necro. Didnt think it would work till I PLed a
friend though PC with a 49 necro. Mem wipe is invauable to PL when you
dont have a good DS. Worked extremely well. Leave it to you how the
details are handled. 

Still a big gap between a druid and everything else.
