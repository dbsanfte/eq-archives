Actually I helped run a "Blues" night once. And everything was blue. 
Including the spag bol.   Tastes exactly the same with blue food colouring 
in it, but quite hard to eat unless you shut your eyes.  If you could 
stomach a blue meal, just dye them all. Surely someone will spot someone 
eating an all blue meal and say something.... however if it's not stolen, 
you can still eat it!!
