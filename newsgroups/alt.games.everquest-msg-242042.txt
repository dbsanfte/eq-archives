Not true.  If you look over the damage bonus tables at Lucy:
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/dmgbonus.html
You will note that the ratio of bonus damage to delay slowly drops
as delay increases.  In this specific case, at level 65, a 35 delay
weapon gets a bonus of 38 while a 40 gets 42, 38:35 > 42:40.

Depends, if you're tanking hard hitting mobs the WMBS' 28 delay will
cause you to take noticeably more damage overall (only matters if
healer mana and/or heal aggro are issues) and have a greater chance
of dying to an ill-timed riposte than a 40+ delay weapon.  It's not
an accident that the damned tennis racket costs 3 to 5 times as much
as a WMBS despite its extreme ugliness and slightly inferior damage
output.  Also, slower delay weapons lose less DPS to spell-casting,
which matters to Paladins on those occasions that we delude ourselves
into thinking that we have enough DPS for anybody to notice that some
of it has been lost.  :-p
