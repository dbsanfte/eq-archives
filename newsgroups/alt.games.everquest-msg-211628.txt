I won't claim to be an expert on the subject, but I would say that your
current setup is the best. You COULD consider dropping the Defiance, and use
the Lupine Dagger as primary at 45... Wolf Form gives added ATK (and maybe
some more, can't remember). But this is by no means the ultimate idea. I
guess it's a matter of taste. And how often you can make your Dagger proc.

Anywhooooo : continue with your current setup for now, and maybe give the
Dagger a swing at 45. See how you like it.
