Hmm same here. Never noticed much fizzles before but lately my standard
spells like malisement (lvl 44) is fizzling every other cast. Also evocation
nukes, which is my specialization, actually fizzle from time to time now
(had 5 fizzles on Char last night in a 2 hour raid. normally I get 0 to 1
max).

Not sure what VI is up to but something is going on. Or we all had a case of
bad luck.
