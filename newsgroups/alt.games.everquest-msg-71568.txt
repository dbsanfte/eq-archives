Took me 2 Arena trips to get to dubious. I tagged every single mob
with a low-level DD spell, and we pulled named mobs which give BIG
faction hits. A guild mate made a trip to the Arena with our resident
uber guild. He went in at dubious faction and left at max ally. One
word: Statue.

Usually. I've seen giants who can see invis trained/pulled to the
route and the zone. The Kael trip is not for the faint of heart. If
your camo drops you're most likely dead.
