Yeah, yeah, I know the Warrior epic is crap compared to other stuff
that's out there now... but I still want it for my main.  It's a
symbol... a rite of passage, if you will...

That being said... Oh My GOD!  80% of this thing needs raids!!

I'm trying to set up some raids with my guild...

Anyone have any tips for a raid on the Sarnak Queen in Chardok?

For the Red Scale, which is easier?  Naggy in Sol, Ragefire in Sol,
Talendor in Skyfire, or Nortlav Scalekeeper in the Hole?

Any tips for killing any of these or other epic mobs?  (Severilous in
EJ... Maestro in Hate, Spiroc Lord in PoAir, Fright/Dread/Terror in
PoFear.)


Thanks in advance!
