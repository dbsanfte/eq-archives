Suggestion for a new server - was wandering across the commons the other day
feeling slightly nostalgic for the days when there used to be eighty odd
players there and remembering the shouted warnings about the Griffon.
Anyway, I came across a genuine newbie who was really struggling to get into
the game and was on the verge of quitting.



I made him some banded armour and gave him some PP and took him to the
bazaar to help him twink up a bit and had a long chat with him.



It did strike me though that the EQ Gods might like to consider a new and
recommended server for players totally new to the game. That way there would
always be other people around to group with who were genuine newcomers.  Ok
so they would not be able to twink up in the bazaar - but is that a bad
thing?  The server could have a level limit - say 20/25 whereby once they
reached that level in order to progress they would then get a free transfer
with all items to a mature server of their choice.
