Gamers Click Home for Holidays  

By Brad King

Families visiting the virtual world of Ultima Online, a popular
Internet fantasy game, can enjoy a special festival of lights this
winter in addition to the usual gaming fare. 

Players will see Santa's sleigh land on their rooftops, reindeer on
their front lawns and exploding fireworks in the sky. 

Ultima Online, the first commercially successful role-playing game,
puts players in the mythical world of Britanna, where they can venture
forth on solo quests like hunting for treasure or congregate with
friends in one of the various towns. 

This year, the game's 225,000 players will be entertained with holiday
parties, visits from Santa Claus and an annual house-decorating
competition. 

But the real fun happens when the players themselves start developing
their own specialized content. 

"We pay a lot of attention to player-created content," said Amy Sage,
Ultima Online's community relations manager, "because they can really
provide better material for other players." 

Millions of players have signed up to play online games like Everquest
and Dark Age of Camelot, and when that many people get together during
the winter holidays, parties soon follow. 

In the world of Ultima, weddings and birthday parties are routine.
Players can alter virtually any visual element in the game -- from
houses to silverware. That freedom, along with the strong sense of
community that many participants feel, lends itself to online
celebrations. Last year, a player made his own Santa Claus and sleigh
by chopping down a tree, building a model, and outfitting it with
clothes dyed red and white. 

Online communities have long integrated real-world events into their
virtual environments. Halloween and the Fourth of July celebrations
are particular favorites, according to several game developers. This
year's World Cup also brought gamers together in wild festivities.
After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, several communities held
candlelight vigils. 

But the winter holidays offer a special chance for people to get to
know their virtual friends in a festive environment. 

Bruce Economy, whose job as a Sony game master includes supervising
player adventures, plans to pass out milk, cookies and even some
magical goodies to the 400,000 residents of the online role-playing
game Everquest. 

However, his Kris Kringle alter ego, Santa Claugg, will be an oversize
ogre decked out in red, green and silver armor. Last year, players
followed his character all over the map, waiting in long lines, hoping
for a chance to climb on his lap to tell him what they wanted for
Christmas. 

"Anytime we do an event in a game, there are always some people who
are interested," Economy said. "But when a holiday comes around, and
they see a new character in the game, everyone can't help but come
around and investigate." 

Everquest's guilds, a collection of gamers who work together on
various projects, get involved as well. In the past, they have staged
gift exchanges where the newest (and weakest) players receive swords
and armor, ensuring they will survive the season, Economy said. 

The good will is mixed with fun, too. In the U.S. version of Lineage,
a popular Korean role-playing game, developers are erecting a
Christmas tree in Oren, the main city, where Santa Claus will make his
appearance, said designer Lance Stites. 

The real party, though, starts when the red-nosed reindeer are
released into the wild, starting a month-long hunting season.
