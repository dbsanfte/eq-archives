You're not the only vet here.  I'm currently on active duty as a Machinist's
Mate, and have been for eight years.  Yes, it would have been nice for
Verant to have had something in the MotD, but it's not required.  I noticed,
though, that there was a candlelight vigil held by many players on the
Raithe.  I didn't get to attend, since I was on watch when it happened, but
it happened none the less.
