Apparently there is a large batch of PoP with faulty CD2. I had one which is
typical of my luck. I had installed the expansion and noticed that an error
reports at very end of disk2 after it reached 100% and asked for disk 1
again. I logged in registered and the PoP book portals wouldn't work.

hmmm thinking cap on. I checked the files and the PoP files were not there.
The installer deleted what it had installed after it reported the error. All
the error was was on a spell effect tga file.

If you get the same disk2 this is how i got around it.

The default dir for the installation is c:\program files\sony\everquest. I
am sure like me you have it elsewhere. No matter

Make this folder on your machine and open it

In the sony\everquest folder make a new folder called temp

Start installation

When disk1 finishes and it asks for disk 2. Press Alt tab and bring up the
open folder. move all the files in sony\everquest to sony\everquest\temp

Put in disk 2 and start the rest of installation. These files are all old
world norrath files.

When it gets to the eroror (will say cyclic fault on D:\ (or whatever ya CD
is called) blah blah

Alt tab again and move the rest of the files and folders to temp and click
ok on the fault.

Shut down all of the installer etc.

Now move all the files and folders out of the temp dir to your main
everquest folder (make backup if unsure)

Now run everquest. It will patch and grab down the missing few files.

Run the game and bingo. PoP enabled.

Gotta love it. In nexus, click book, click GD run to velks. No giving druid
KEI for port ) heheh
