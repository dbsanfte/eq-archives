    Agreed. One class can do that almost entirely - rogues. Three classes
can do this by removing themselves from the hate list cleanly and quickly -
Shadow Knights, Monks, Necromancers. Four classes, THREE of which are
melees. Your contention that casters are better at CR than melees is,
therefore, unmitigated crap. And that's without even discussing which of the
three Feign-capable classes would likely be able to feign successfully,
given their AC and HPs.
