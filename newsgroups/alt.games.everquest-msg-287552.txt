I picked up two copies of Rise of Kunark last night. OMG what a fun
game, I loaded it on my desktop PC, which is a Core 2 quad, with 4GB
Ram and a 7900GTX, it looks and plays fantastic and after playing for
5 levels I am completely excited, I can't wait to get off work. I
loaded XP on my Macbook Pro with Bootcamp and loaded the second copy
on there for my wife. We put in about an hour last night as the
downloads took a good bit of time.

Initial impression seems MUCH better than WoW on a lot of levels. The
only place I see WoW to be superior is that is seems to have less
horsepower requirements, WoW is a bit smoother on the Macbook Pro,
which is a core 2 duo with a Radeon X1600 and 2GB Ram.

On a completely different note, I canceled my LOTRO subscription after
a week, I never enjoyed that game for one single second.
