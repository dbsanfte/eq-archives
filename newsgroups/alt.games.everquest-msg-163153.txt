Anyone got any suggestion about getting these guys, one at a time to a
group? Is FD pulling the answer because it seems our SK was getting
harmtouched quite a bit and every pull came back along with an Umbrous
Toiler. Not much of a problem because I just mezz or root the adds but
with the intermittent LFG person joining the group mezz breaking
became a problem (why it should be a problem at mid 50's is beyond me
but thats reality).
