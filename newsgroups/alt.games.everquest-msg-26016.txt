JaZZ, I don't know if a Druid beat you up when you were a kid and you
hate them ever since, but I think you are reading too much in my post.
The reason I play a Druid and not a Necromancer is because I *like*
helping people. I port for free for corpse recoveries, (even as I insist
on payment when it's just a matter of lazyness). I SoW left, right and
center without asking for donations, I cure poison and disease wherever
I find them, and many a newbie, lowbie and midbie owes their life to a
well-timed Greater Heal as I passed by.

Part of the reason I've been reluctant to guilding is because those acts
of random kindness I enjoy so much may be taken for granted within the
guild, and perhaps even frowned upon if bestowed outside it. I think I'd
feel slightly guilty by helping out people to the extent that I do if I
felt I'm making myself unavailable to my guildmates at the same time.

As for my Epic... I'm more than resigned to never having it, as well as
never set foot in the Planes or in most of the high-level areas. That
has never entered my calculations when I have considered joining a
guild.

Still, I've found Dan's post most informative and helpful, and it will
definitely weight a lot in my final decision.
