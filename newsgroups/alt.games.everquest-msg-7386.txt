Since the May 8th patch, I've had a problem.  I'm unable to pull up the
list of EQ servers while Norton Firewall is running on my machine.

Disabling NF takes care of the problem, and I had no problems before the
patch.

Has anyone else had this problem, and if so, come up with an appropriate
workaround?

Thanks.
