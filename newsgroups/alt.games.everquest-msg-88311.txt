LOL I've had the same problem. My usual response is that I'm a druid,
not a cleric. I don't keep heal memmed because I don't get hit. =P Then
I add the idiot to my ignore list.

To the original poster, technically is not kill stealing unless the
other person/group has actually engaged the mob. That is how Verant sees
it. On the other hand, common etiquette among players allows for
something called "camping" (which Verant does not support); that means
that certain areas/spawns can be claimed by soloing characters or groups
and it's considered bad manners to take spawns from that area. A GM
won't say squat if you don't respect someone's camp (which is what the
people at the orcs had, from the sound of it); but it will get you a
less than wonderful reputation amongst other players if you do things
like that often. The best solution is to ask first if you aren't sure.
