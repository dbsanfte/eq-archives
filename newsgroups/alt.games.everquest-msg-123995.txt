People still fall for snake oil, Nigerian money scams, astrology, magnetic healing,
psychics
and psychic healing, ghosts, telepathy, etc, etc, etc.

So of course they still fall for the old pyramid schemes.

Hell just look at the popularity of that Crossing Over TV show.

I saw some poll results and of 40,000
respondents 70% believe that the world is less than 10,000
years old. These were Americans. Fucking frightening.

Absolutely amazing that we have landed men on the moon
and think we have come so far and yet much of the human race
is still in the stone age intellectually.

And remember you have won a million dollars!
