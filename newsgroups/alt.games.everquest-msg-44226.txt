 Yes. I am serious. For one thing you're a bard. You have speediness and
invis. When I said tank I mean someone who can't invis themselves. So
yeah, I stand by what I said above. Anyway I said "tank". Since when is
a bard a tank? :P

 Yes. There are times when the zone in part isn't camped. There may be a
dozen people sitting at zone but they are all afk or lfg and they are
not pulling the frogs.

 That's nice. Not everyone is so lucky. Get a lot of caster mobs, get
stunned once or twice, and the result would probably not be pleasant.

 Perhaps. But it doesn't contribute much to getting people there either.
