No, I would not have called them veiled either =)

Actually I intended the *idea* of it as a *response* to be tongue in 
cheek, writing as if it was an actual response to him, playing up the 
transparent absurdity of the idea that his "open letter to the 
community" represented anything remotely bi-directional with *me*.

That said the criticisms within the response were (mostly) about valid 
issues, in particular the offense I took to the blatant self serving 
doubletalk surrounding the customer handling situation (I can't bring 
myself to even call it service). 

Of course I would hardly characterize my response as a 'balanced and 
fair argument'. Like a Michael Moore 'documentary', my objective was to 
make a point and drive it home hard, indulging in a little hyperbole of 
my own in the name of balancing out the indefensible self-congratualtory 
tone of the original letter.
