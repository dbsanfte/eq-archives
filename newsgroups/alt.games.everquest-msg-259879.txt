We must be playing entirely different games.  The WoW stress test that I am
playing has no issues whatsoever with camping or killstealing.  Spawn points
are abundant, quests are abundant and easy to complete, and the game is
remarkably stable.

The

And your complaint is?  The definition of "kill stealing" is that someone
attacks a MOB you are already in combat with and gets XP/credit for it.
Bob, the change you describe above eliminates kill stealing and makes the
game much more fun for a solo player.  What are you complaining about here?

Most MOB's in WoW have many spawn points.  Spend some time exploring and you
will find multiple spawn points many of which are uncrowded.  Also, it
should be noted that WoW provides far more quests than the typical MMOPRG
and, hence, if a particular area looks crowded you can simply do some other
quest on your queue.  Blizzard appears to have paid enormous attention to
providing large numbers of quests, a HUGE gaming world, and multiple spawn
points.  I seriously doubt there are going to be any camping problems
outside of the first few days of gameplay.

> 2) The game seems to be populated primarily by the battle.net crowd.

What do you expect from a free and open stress test?!  Do you think the same
Battle.Net crowd will be there when there is a credit card registration and
a $13 monthly fee?  I doubt it.  You can't compare free demo releases of a
game with the final and full product.  Battle.Net attracts 14 year olds
because it is free -- any free game including all the First Person Shooters
attract that crowd.  As soon as a game imposes a credit card registration
requirement, most of the kiddies go away.
