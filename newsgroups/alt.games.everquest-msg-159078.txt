I've gone 2 months straight without asking for (or getting) loot, playing
every day of the week, making virtually all raids for 5-6 days a week (thats
a LOT of raids)

I frequently go a month or so without getting an item.  Does attending
almost everything, and leading / running raids count as working my butt off?
If so, yes I have... often.

> If you would, then I think youre pretty gullible.

Nope, im just not greedy.  I have realistic expectations, I have a well
thought out wish list, and I use my merit accordingly so that when something
drops I really want, I'm in good standing for the decision.

Also, I play to raid.. raiding is what I enjoy in EQ.  There doesnt need to
be a loot incentive for me to attend, i go to everything, whether its a
"wizard loot mob" a cleric loot mob or whatever, im there.

I like helping people, I love helping my guild progress, im as happy as the
loot winner when they get something, be it a cleric, wizard, magician,
rogue, whoever, because as well as upgrading them, it upgrades the guild.

Theres your answer.

And for the record, we regularly given loot to first time raiders /
out-of-guild people.
