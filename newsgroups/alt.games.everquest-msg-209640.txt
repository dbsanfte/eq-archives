While the invis song is particularly good if anyone in your group has a pet,
you'll want to equip a wind instrument for it.  If you are particularly clever,
you can juggle a wind instrument (while singing Clouding) a drum (while singing
AE DOT, preferably near the guards) and a string instrument (while singing
selos)

Of course if there is no pet in the group you can happily weild strings the
whole time as the fact that invis will fail won't matter so much.
