Hmm... the bandits are too low in level to me even now, at almost 18. We
must be talking about different camps -- I noticed the ones along the water,
where you run to Queynos, although those were not the ones I was referring

kite the elephants? (oh, and the Centaurs kicked my butt! ;) )

Darklet, druid of *almost* 18 seasons

Thanks for playing.
