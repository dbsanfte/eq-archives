FBSS: Belt, 21% haste

SCWH: Gloves, 22% haste, str +3, dex +3, agi +3, all saves +3

I like stats. :) Yes, there are nicer gloves, but the nice haste mixed
with decent stats, and still letting me have a belt with even MORE
stats, is nicer than taking up my belt slot with ONLY haste, and having
slightly better gloves.

Just my view on the subject. ;)
