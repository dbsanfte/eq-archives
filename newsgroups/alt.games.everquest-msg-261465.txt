Not in an automated way, however, you can do it manually.

Simply go into the advanced portion of your EQ patcher, select OOW, go 
back to the patcher and hit download, leave it run as long as you like, 
then stop, go back to advanced, select OOW off, back to patcher and log in.

Next time you log in and have some time available, do the same thing.

The patcher checks files in the categories you have selected, and 
downloads missing ones.  If you interrupt it, it throws away the 
partially completed file it was working on, but all the ones it 
successfully loaded stay on your machine.

On DSL it took me over 2 hours to download the OOW files, however, I did 
so in four sessions, setting up to download, then doing the dishes or 
other household chores (wife cheers at my heroism) then sitting back 
down to play.

Another option would be to leave it on overnight, where you'd 
theoretically get 8 hour spans of downloading.
