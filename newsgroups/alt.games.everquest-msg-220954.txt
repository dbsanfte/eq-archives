Also, if you die in a dangerous place where you might have a difficult
time getting to your corpse, you can ask a necro or SK to last Lesser
Summon Corpse (for players level 35 and under, requires a Black
Ceremonial Coffin for spell component which costs about 1-2 pp) or
Summon Corpse (levels over 35, requires Jade Inlaid Coffin component
which costs about 175 pp).  You'll get your corpse back but not the
experience you lost.
