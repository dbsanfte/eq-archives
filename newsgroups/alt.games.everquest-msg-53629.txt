And what if I wanna raid a place that people haven't documented 15 times 
yet? Or if I wanna try a new strategy? I can't?

Of course. But even when planned really well, things can go wrong. 
Puller got lagged and trained, or pathing failed and wiped out the raid. 
Like I said, shit happens

Uh, and if I want to raid before level 50? I remember that my raid on 
Mistmoore when I was 30 was one of the most fun ones

I fully agree with the concept of learning from mistakes. Mine or 
someone elses. But it means that someone has made that mistake once. And 
learned. Well, my first learning experience of Fear included a 4 hour 
corpse recovery where about a dozen people lost multiple levels.

I understand it, I don't like it myself either. But when my dog has 
crapped on the carpet or my girlfriend is back from work earlier than 
usual, I would still like the choice. No, I don't PLAN on attending half 
a raid, but I don't wanna feel like a complete asshole if curcumstainces 
suggest that I log off early.
Besides, if you PLAN that a raid will last 6 hours, and you planned that 
after that you'll be going to a wedding of your buddy, who's to say that 
the raid will not wipe out and last 14 hours instead?
