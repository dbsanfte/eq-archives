    Quest XP scales with the zone experience modifier for the zone, and
recently all cities with exterminator quests had their ZEMs reduced
drastically.

    Nope, sadly it was to stop the following: make a level 1 character. Kill
one of those new quest critters in the city. Notice how easy it is to kill
them. Find the spawn point for one of them, notice they have a very fast
respawn time. Kill, kill, kill with no risk and no reason to leave the city
and explore the newbie grounds until the quest critters go green at what,
level 4?

    It's fun to imagine the thought processes at SOE:

(1) Hey, let's create a new quest for all the cities. I know, people can
kill gimped level 1 mobs in cities for quest drops! That's easy to code!
(2) Whoops, people are actually using the gimped mobs to get XP. Imagine
that - players have never taken the easiest possible path to fast XP before!
We don't want them to miss out on all the excitement of whacking bats and
rats in the newbie zones.... Hey, let's lower the ZEM on cities - that'll
stop this cold!
(3) Oh, whoops. Why didn't anyone tell us that quest XP was also modified by
ZEM? Now the very extermination quest we were so proud of gives squat in the
way of XP, so it's pointless to have it there. Oh, and look what we've done
to newbie zones that are inside cities, like in Paineel and Ak'Anon! Maybe
we could raise quest XP across the board, and....

    I hope they figure out that the extermination quests were a stupid idea
to begin with. Up the XP on handing in the newbie note to put a character to
level 2 (that seems to be the intent here anyways, that characters first go
outside at level 2), get rid of the exterminator quests, and set the ZEMs
back the way they were. Much less hassle than whatever other stupid idea
that will break some other part of the game they will try next.
