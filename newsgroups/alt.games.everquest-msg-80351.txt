I took my druid to GD at 29 after just basically getting the snot kicked out
of me repeatedly in IC by those tigers or whatever I was trying to kill.
Started on the tizmaks and now at 42 even though the feral cave kodiaks are
starting to green out, taken in groups of 4 (quad-kiting) - GD remains the
best and safest exp for my money.
