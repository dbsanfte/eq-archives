> Anyone tried the door in the bank in freeport for picklock?

Not only do you have to be level 51, the REASON you have to
be level 51 to pick this door is because you have to have a skill
of 201 to do it.  You can't ever do it at PickLock (200), even if
you're level 60.  You have to spend time at the Befallen/E.Freeport
doors to get your (200) to (201).

> What about detect traps, what is the safest place to work on that?

Anywhere.  Detect traps was maxxed before I ever even hit
the level where I would just go sit in SolA and practice Disarm
Traps.

> Any ideas on pickpocket?

It is possible to get Pickpocket skill up to level 200 without
ever touching a critter in combat to do it.  My rogues usually
practiced both Pickpocket and Disarm on waaaaaay green
orcs and goblins in the Misty Thicket.  Nice, because one hit
will kill 'em, and when you kill the one holding the rusty weapon,
just hand it to his camp-mate to practice Disarm on him, too...
