What I've seen is that the cleric camping Rage (or her proxy) is there
24x7 with one to three groups keeping company and killing mobs for xp
and spells.  There's a key group of people who exchange phone numbers
so that the raid force can be assembled quickly even if Rage pops at

3am.  Sometimes a well organized guild manages to jump in while the

coalition raid is forming, but only sometimes.  A fair number of small

and/or social guild clerics on Tunare seem to have succeeded in

getting their epic in this way.  I don't know if they have a list,

but they do always seem to know who's next.
