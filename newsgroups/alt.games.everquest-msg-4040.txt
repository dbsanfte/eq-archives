The rule of thumb is that any day you take off in the hope of playing
some EQ is the day that the servers will be down.

The weird thing is that not only is this almost guaranteed, it's
almost a universal experience - it's happened to me several times, and
I think everyone has been bitten by it.

Since you're the one who took off this time, we're going to blame
today's down time on you. Consider yourself the recipient of withering
scorn :)
