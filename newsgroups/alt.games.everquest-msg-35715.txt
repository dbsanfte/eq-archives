    Good if you're trying for a general resist item, or lack the specific
resist you want. The BA has two more resist points total, too - but the SSB
has 35 HPs, and could actually be worn as part of his regular gear (high AC,
HPs, and MR). I don't think he wants a BA coif as part of his regular gear.
