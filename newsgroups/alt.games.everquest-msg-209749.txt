You should have the tinkered assembly kit from Xalirilan.

When you said "I want to craft a bracer", Xalirilan gave you another item
named something like Wristband Pattern

Into this, put the kobold scalp, minotaur scalp, plague rat tail, and
cloth wristband (note, NOT a small cloth wristband), and make sure all the
remaining spaces are empty.  Now click combine.  If you have done this
successfully, you'll get a square item named something like Wristband
Materials.

Now you put the Wristband Materials and the Wristband Pattern into a
normal sewing kit (or large sewing kit, or a loom, or... well there are
many other choices, but the simple way is to buy a sewing kit, which has
two slots which is all you'll need to do these quests) and hti combine
again.

Now get another pattern and more of the quest items and do this again.
Special note, DON'T do the combine to get the materials twice in a row
without making the bracer in between.  Thats what I did... found out the
"Wristband Materials" are lore, so the second material doesn't appear in
your inventory.  First make the first bracer, THEN make the second
materials and then the second bracer; the bracers aren't lore, just the
materials!

The one that Xalirilan gave you.  It has the word Tinkered in its name.
If you really can't tell, destroy them all and start over, Xalirilan will
give you one if you dont' have one on you.
