Good Parenting
1. Remove PC from kids room.
2. Cancel EQ account (must have been on parents CC card)
3. Take an active interest in how the kid spends his free time.
4. Spend time with the kid, instead of letting the PC (or TV) babysit.

Poor parenting
1. Send the kid off to boarding school, and let someone else deal with
him.
2. Blame the makers of a game, when the real problem is parents that
can't be bothered to monitor their own child in their own home.
