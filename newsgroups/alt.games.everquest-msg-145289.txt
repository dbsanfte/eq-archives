Point based.  Start with 8 in all stats, and 27 points to spend.  Raising a
stat +1 that is below 16 costs 1 point, otherwise 2 points, and you can't
raise any stat at creation past 18.  (This is before any mods, such as race
mods, are applied...so you can get above 18 if you play a race that has stat
boosts).

They include some suggestions for converting an online character over.
Take your level/2, rounded down (they don't say what to do with a level 1
online character...I guess if your online character is only level 1, you
should just make a new PnP character :-)) to get your PnP level.

For stats, an online score is converted using this table:

    Online score        PnP score
      0 -  50            6
     51 -  55            7
     56 -  60            8
        ...             ...
     96 - 100           16
    101 - 110           17
    111 - 120           18
        ...             ...
    161 - 170           23
       171+             24

Here's what Online scores are used for each PnP score:

    PnP ability         Online ability
        STR                 STR
        CON                 STA
        DEX                 average DEX and AGI
        INT                 INT
        WIS                 WIS
        CHR                 CHR

The combat system looks pretty much straight out of D&D, except for weapon
speed, which I'll mention below.  In particular, they have not brought over
EQ melee skills, like 1HB, 2HS, etc.  Rather, there are the weapon
proficency feats, just like D&D.

The various EQ casting skills (Evocation, Abjuration, etc) are all part of a
single skill: Channeling.  The skills are all on a buy-with-points system,
like D&D, rather than a skill-up-by-using system like online EQ.

Speaking of skills, alcohol tolerance is amusing.  It is a class skill for
everyone except Clerics and the INT casters.  For them, it is a cross-class
skill.  (For you non-D&D players, what that means is that the cap is lower
per level, and you have to spend twice as many skill points for each
improvement in the skill).  I suppose that makes sense: when you think "we
need to send someone into that bar to drink that guy under the table to get
him to talk", you usually don't think "send the priest!".  While this would
never happen in online EQ, having to go get an NPC drunk to get information
out of him would be a perfectly reasonable thing in a PnP game.

It looks like D&D-style multiclassing is there.

Shorties run slower than normal races!

It looks like weapon delay and base attack bonus determine how many attacks
you get per round.  If you base attack bonus is N, and your weapon delay is
D, you get a series of attacks per round as follows:

    One attack at bonus N,
    One attack at bonus N-D,
    One attack at bonus N-2D,
    ...

So, someone with a BAB of 10, using a weapon with a delay of 7, would have
two attacks, at +10 and +3.  Using a weapon with a delay of 4 would give
them three attacks, at +10, +6, and +2.  The Double Attack feat lets you
calculate your attacks as if your delay were one less.

Mana pool is appropriate_ability_modifier x 2 x level, where the appropriate
ability modifier is your INT modifier for INT casters and WIS modifier for
WIS casters.  For you non-D&D players, here are the ability modifiers:

    Ability     Modifier
     2 -  3     -4
     4 -  5     -3
     6 -  7     -2
     8 -  9     -1
    10 - 11      0
    12 - 13     +1
    14 - 15     +2
    16 - 17     +3
    18 - 19     +4  and so on

So, a level 20 Wizard with 18 INT would have 4*2*20 = 160 mana.  To give an
idea what that means, Ice Comet takes 67 mana.  Speaking of Ice Comet, I
see that, unlike online EQ, there is a much more random component to spell
damage.  Ice Comet in online EQ does 1110 damage at level 49, rising to 1120
damage at 50.  It basically does that every time, unless there is a resist
(on unless there is a critical hit).  The PnP Ice Comet does (4d10)x10, so
it can range from 40 to 400, distributed in some kind of bell curve around
200.

It's level-4 for hybrids when computing mana.

Mana recovery works like this: when resting, you recover per hour the sum of
your relevant ability modifier and the number of skill ranks you have in the
meditation skill.  If enganged in light activity (walking, riding), you
recover that amount in two hours.  If engaged in heavy activity (combat,
running, riding at a gallop), it takes 4 hours.  Recovery is prorated for
times spent less than those times.  E.g., if you recover 10 an hour resting,
and your rest is interrupted after half an hour, you get 5 for that half
hour.

OK, now I'm curious, so am looking up mana recovery spells:

    Breeze      Adds +3 mana every 10 minutes.
    Clarity     Adds +1 mana every 2 minutes.
    C2          Adds +1 mana every minute.
    Harvest     Adds 2 mana per caster level, 3 hour recast time.
    KEI         Adds +2 mana every minute, increase mana pool by 42,
                adds +4 to INT and WIS.

Unless I'm missing something, it looks like Enchanters are really going to
speed mana recovery up (even more than they do in online EQ).  (Although, I
suppose that doesn't make as big a difference in PnP, where the party just
says, "We sit down in this safe area and wait until everyone is FM" and the
DM says rolls to see if it really was a safe area, then says "OK, two hours
pass, and everyone is FM now") (of course, the DM can design things so that
wasting two hours of game time on your ass makes bad things happen...).

More random spell observations, based on things I noticed while flipping
around looking up the above spells:

1. Evacs are a lot more risky here.  Each party member has to roll a d20,
and is left behind on a 1.  (Well, not each party member...each of the up to
6 people that the caster has designated as targets of the spell).

2. According to the description of the Wizard Skyfire port: "The destination
is not entirely safe".  That sounds like an invitation for the DM to be
mean. :-)

3. Bind Sight does 1 HP/round damage to the caster.  Ouch.  Bind Sight
jumping from target to target, even if out of range, is explicity allowed.
Cool.  Target gets to make a will saving throw.  If successful, the target
is aware that some kind of spell has been cast at it, but does not know what
(the spell still works on them).

4. Reviviscence is 100% XP restoration.

5. I see spells that add to cold and fire resistence, so I guess they did
keep the online EQ resistences.

Looking at Bards...they can twist.  To twist two songs, they have to make a
difficulty check using their Perform skill, against a DC of 8 + the level of
the highest level song they are twisting.  For three songs, it is 18 +
highest level, for four songs it is 32 + highest level, and for five songs,
it is 50 + highest level.  On a failure, all the songs stop.

Bards use 1 mana per round when playing songs (doesn't matter how many
songs).  (This is in addition to any mana used by the few Bard songs that
use mana).  So, Bards aren't as unlimited as they are in the online game.
They'll need to rest like the casters.

All in all, this looks kind of interesting.
