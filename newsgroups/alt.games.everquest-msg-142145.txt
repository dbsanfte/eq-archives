Bar???  bard? barbarian?  sha - shaman?  shadowknight?

Biggest hit varies.. I remember about a year back, a warrior got a one off
fluke 1k+ hit.  rogues can crit for about 1.8k?  biggest monk hit ive seen
was 980 (using a primal bat - so not a great damage weap)
Paladin.. about 4k with SU?   Seen a ranger get a 1300 hit.. with the new AA
skills, hits are just going to go up and up

> Like can you find 10000 PLAT or more at once.

10,000pp, or something worth 10kpp?

You wont find mobs with that much cash on them... but you can find loot on
some thats worth MUCH MUCH more.  SoDs - 500,000pp.  A BoC was auctioned
recently and reached 1million plat.  Barbed legs.. 400,000pp?  150,000+ for
a gnome mask?   Fungis - 60k or so.   CT ft3 boots - 50k+

What value would you put on the RoS uber loot?  The 100hp bracer.. the FT4
gloves.. the 15/20 poker..

I wonder what a guild would pay for an ST key?  (Zlands is droppable)
100,000+ I bet, if somebody really really wanted primal
