Nah, the guy is ON arcane scientists, hence the big drop. The knights
of truth drop is pretty small ( I don't think my faction moved) As I
said it would be best if he built up knights of truth first before
trying it and checked back and forth. Knights of truth is pretty darn
easy to raise even from kos in time, just mindless orc beating.
Freeport milita, after a lucan hit, meanwhile is a bear to raise and
desperate times call for desperate measures.

It would likely put him in KOS with arcane scientists which is why I
pointed out where they were and how easily avoided they are. I don't
really think a rogue would feel much incentive to approach those two
npcs out in front of it and loiter there anyway. I was prepared to put
myself into KOS with arcane, its pretty much a non issue. I just went
and checked it when dubious and found militia was amiable.

The plus for killing him does seem higher than doing any of the lil
quests, be they highold ears and junk or the inert thing. I pointed
him out because he seems like the best mob to kill which raises it
without also blowing knights of truth as much as killing knights of
truth specifically. Plus you can tie it in with camping hadden for at
least something to do while there.

As far as you not thinking that verant sees moving a quest npc next to
another one for a hand in as being exploitive, they just nerfed a
similar situation quest for this same reason a while back. It was the
one with Elsa Florawhisper in WL and sentry Emil in skyshrine. It
raised many plane of growth or whatever factions as well as claws of
veeshan. She was way over by the druid ring while sentry emil is
inside skyshrine, of course. My druid did the quest by binding by
emil, porting to WL, running to her and making the exhange and gating
back. I'd sit at each npc for a second to keep mana up. This was not
enough for other people. They instead trained her to the zone to
skyshrine so they could simply get the note from emil zone and give it
to her and zone back. Consequently Verant ripped the quest a new one
after seeing this behavior and making it so that once you do the
delivery to her she poofs. She comes back so much later that its not
worth doing the quest more than once. Its really a shame it jacked it
up for people like me doing it right.

They actually had done something similar for a while with the inert
potion quest, it seemed. For about 3 months or so it was always the
wrong slansin who just screwed your factions (some other people
noticed this too) Now its always the right one again who raises
militia and such. I don't know if that was a coincidence or what but
many of us thought they had nerfed it perm.

So I think verant does frown on shortening the distance between quest
npcs forcibly by training. Like you say though, they could just nerf
it permanently like they did the Florawhisper one in WL. Maybe they
don't view the inert one as having as much to gain?
