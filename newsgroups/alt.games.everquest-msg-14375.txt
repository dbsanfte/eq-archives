You really think Verant considers anything thoroughly? ;)

Offhand, I'd say they looked at the idea of "You know, we could increase our
profits if we cut back on the Customer service staff...  what do they do that
we could semi-reasonably say 'Thats not our problem.'?" Ignoring the long term
effects of losing customers over it.  Both in terms of accounts banned,
friends of those people quitting, and general negative publicity.

Ok, homeowners insurance then.

As for what my comment has to do with anything... well, the way I interpreted
it, you were basicly telling me "Why are you wasting time and effort arguing
about this, since theres only a small chance it will ever happen to you?"

My response is "The same reason people insure themselves against loss.  They
pay a small price currently in order to protect themselves against a possible
disaster,  which would impact them many times more significantly than the
amount they're paying."
