The Irony here is that this is not for my twink but for my main, a soon to
be 51st Warrior :ï¿½/.
I read everywhere that groups hunting there are common...erm...not on
Bristlebane they aren't...oh well, I'll just make the point of popping in
there a lot to see if a there is a group there I can join or at least
scrounge from. I am only really after the arms, guants and boots I wear
cobalt and all the other items are far too heavy for me.

Thanks for info
