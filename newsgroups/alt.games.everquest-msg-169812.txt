This is what happened. I decided to try another complete
uninstall/reinstall, and noticed that my Kunark disc installed into my
Windows folder (not even into a folder under Windows, that was fun to sort
out)

So I created a folder under Program Files called Sony, with a folder inside
that called Ever Quest, and moved all the files into there. Then I
reinstalled the rest of my discs, and ran the patcher. Low and behold, now
under advanced I have a check box for Kunark. Checked everything (except
Legends, ain't that rich yet), can a complete file check, and 23 minutes
later (god I love cable modems) ... I was happily running through Overthere,
looking at mobs the way they are supposed to be looked at. (That is, through
the business end of a lvl 49 skelly pet)

Thanx to everyone who replied
