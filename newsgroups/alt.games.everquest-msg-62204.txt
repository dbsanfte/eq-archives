I just cleaned a friend's computer of this today.

1) Boot into Safe Mode
2) rename kernal32.EXE (not the DLL) to something else
3) delete the virus' KDLL.DLL (trojan keystroke logger)
4) Delete the reference to the Kernal32.exe in
HKLM/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/RunOnce (that's from memory)
5) Change any passwords that may have been sent out by it.

By the time you've got the KDLL file (etc) it's already sent its emails out.
