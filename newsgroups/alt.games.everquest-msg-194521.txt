	You don't have an argument.  You're just asking people to recap the whole
freaking situation for you, I.E., you are talking out of your ass.  Do your
own research.

	N.B. that if this discussion were taking place in a more formal setting
then yes, I'd pull out citations.  But this is Usenet; even if the Holy
Trinity appeared and supported me, you'd probably still deny it.
