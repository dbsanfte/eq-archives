Same is true in Michigan, and, in fact, my stepson got a ticket for not 
doing so.  Some idiot woman on a country road decided to turn right by 
first turning left in a "barnyard" turn, with no turn signal indicating 
which way she was actually intending to go, so, he passed her on the 
left, and she turned into his path.  The result was, he got ticketed for 
not honking his horn before passing, and got the points for being at 
fault in the accident.  I should add, she did not get a ticket at all.
