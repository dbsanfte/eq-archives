o, i meant "grandmaster-tailor" (or whatever the term is). i thought a
master was a skill over 200, is it only a skill over 100?

i knew u had to get a lot of the skills over 100 but do you need to get any
over 200?

i dont think you do but im not sure. some peeps say you can stop the
tailoring at 158 and hope for a success (even though the Embroidered Coldain
Prayer Shawl trivials somewhere over 190). others say get it into the 200s.
