No, you are right Monks CAN attack with magic gloves in H2H. 
This was why Wu's Fighting Gloves used to be desirable items for low level

I'm talking about a Warrior (or any other melee) I cannot punch anything 
requiring Magic to hit them no matter that I am wearing Magic Gaunts..I 
can, however, kick the mob but only because I am wearing magic boots.
