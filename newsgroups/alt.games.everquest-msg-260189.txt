You mean the 260 players in the human hewbie zone the other night,
literally camping every single spawn point?  The stripped-down human
female catfights?  The complete lack of a name filter pulling you
straight out of world by allowing stuff like "ImRckJmsBtch"  (okay the
last one was me =)

Yeah, it hasn't changed much.  Oddly enough, I find the horde side
more like the EQ playerbase, and more enjoyable overall.  I'm about
ready to write off most human females and every single fricking gnome
out of hand.

Otherwise, I've been having fun.  Got slow fall with my Mage at L10 so
I've been base-jumping every chance I get. =)  Amusement is where ya
find it.  It doesn't have to be at someone's expense.
