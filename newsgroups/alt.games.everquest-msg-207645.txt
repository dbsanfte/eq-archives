Actually  there was essentially no difference between Dial up and the cable
modem. The reason I brought that up in the first place was to stress that
point.

With my druid   I'm limited  essentially to the old zone or simple ones
graphics  wise. CS, SD, The Grey  were OK.   The more graphic intense zones and
I'd go into a  skide show. It became so frustrating I'd jsut start a numbr of
new characters and play them to 20 or so.  My Druid's stuck  in GD  Everfrost
farming IGs  etc.  I hit ME and I'm dead. I hit BW and I'm in huge trouble.
It's always been that way. The newer zones like JPF are even worse.  NO
difference wither Dial up or  Cable.

I suppose I wasa rally surprised that I could still play the  game with the
dial up. You see for me I'm only able to access 25 percent of the game with all
the expansions.

Thanks again.

All the inputs have been  invaluable.
