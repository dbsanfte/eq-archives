I'm curious. Besides the loot what aspects of game play is more fun in the
40s and 50s as opposed to the oringinal posters 10 to 16?

I think a lot of people think the low levels are drudgery but you can play
them virtually the same as high levels, just different zones. Mechanics of
both indoor and outdoor zones are the same. A place like Upper Guk can be
just as exciting and lethal for lower levels as any of the high level
dungeons is for higher levels. Heck, a lower level guild could probably raid
a mid-level zone and get nearly the same level of opposition that higher
levels get on the planes (although no available rezes for the lowbies). How
many level 15s would it take to pull down a hill giant? How many level 30s
would it take to pull down a wurm in the burning woods. The uber and epic
battles are readily available to lower levels, maybe even more available,
even if the loot isn't. And to top it off at low levels the experience is
faster and the penalties for death are less.

However, I do admit that it wouldn't be much of a casters game doing those
mobs that are much higher in level. Getting spells to stick would be next to
impossible. Wait, what am I saying? There's been many a blue con mob that my
high level caster couldn't stick a spell on. Oh well, sit and med till the
tanks and clerics get done.
