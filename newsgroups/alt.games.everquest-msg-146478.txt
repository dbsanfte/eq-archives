Not during an intermission.  Nearly *everyone* leaves when there's an
intermission.  The theater I saw _The_Right_Stuff_ at had an intermission for
that movie and I was one of 3 people in a fairly crowded theater that didn't
leave during the intermission.  Given the choice of getting up and missing part
of a movie or an intermission, I'll take the intermission every time.  If I'm
willing to get up while a movie is playing, I'd rather not come back.
