Yeah, no crowd control in a group where everybody can root, four out of six
can stun, five out of six can pacify...  that must suck.

Anyway, actually on topic, I'm looking forward to the play as a monster
feature.  Much more than for the ability to "sidekick", I'm interested in
the missions where I get to be the mob being raided.  Sounds like a cool
idea.  We'll have to see if the implementation lives up to its potential. 
The possibility of someone switching out to a cleric, something that happens
all the time already only with alts, has some good potential too.

There is much, *much* potential for coolness with this.  There is also a
huge possibility of them screwing it up beyond belief.  Sadly, with the
track record of Sony, I'd place money on them screwing it up and putting
some mind bogglingly stupid limitation, either in the mechanics or in the
reward, which will make it a seldom used feature no matter how cool it could
be.
