Wizard pets work the same way

And reclaim is based on the current HP of the pet at the time when 
reclaim is cast, so a strategy that revolves around reclaiming nearly 
dead pets isn't a productive one; if I'm chain casting pets I use Get 
Lost to poof the previous pet just before I finish the cast time on the 
one I'm making. Reclaim (even instant reclaim, which I have) would mean 
I'd have to kill pet -then- wait thru the entire cast time hoping the 
target mob stays rooted or otherwise under control.

Even if you could reclaim, your hammer has 200 hp.. hardly worth 
consideration.

There was a time when the hammer could be made persistant; if you got it 
an enchanter haste it wouldnt kill itself for some reason.  Only problem 
with that was that it really won't listen to you, just like an enchanter 
animation, so the only way to get it onto the next target is to get hit. 
  I had some fun with this, with my pet having SOV and Virtue it was 
really pretty mean... but honestly I probably lost more mana between 
healing myself and not remaining on my butt while trying to get the mob 
to tap me one than I normally do just casting pet each target.

Its also false that the hammer kills himself after each target.  He 
kills himself only if he has nothing to do; if you've been hit by 
another mob while he's killing his initial target, he'll come and fight 
that one, and keep doing so as long as there's always another target. 
While bored doing the SolA part of my epic, I once killed every single 
goblin in that half the zone with one pet; I'd cast my little HP buffs 
and AC buffs on him (I was 54 at the time, so by 65 standards those were 
little buffs), and I kept him healed, kept running ahead to the next mob 
and getting hit, but I did none of the damage myself, let the pet kill 
everything.  Efficient?  Effective?  No, but it was a nice challenge.

The worst thing about the cleric pet is that you only get one, at level 
54.  From 54 to 60 its pretty effective, but as it never levels up and 
you don't really have any way to improve its performance, it gradually 
becomes a footnote, unable to damage the mobs you are killing, and since 
its damage doesnt' scale up, even if it -does- manage to keep landing 
blows, its damage output becomes trivial.
