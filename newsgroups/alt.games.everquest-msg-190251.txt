As a follow up to this message, one of the top 10 sellers at
playerauctions posted a message to the playerauction forum stating
that he received an email from a named individual offering 100k pp for
$150 on any EQ server as long as the purchase was in 500k or 1,000k
units.  The message included the a copy of the email he received with
all the details.  That post was deleted within 30 minutes by
playerauctions.  Additional posts along the same lines by others were
immediately deleted.  ???
