If there was no such thing as Temp when you were those levels,
then you have no idea at all how much easier it will be for him now; the 
new hp regen rules and bind wounds rules are massively better for a solo 
warrior than the ones you played under.

Once upon a time, HP regen was negligible, the trick was to start at 50% 
hp, kill a mob that wouldn't do more than 40% of your hp bar in damage, 
then bind back up to 50% to start over.

NOW, the deal is to start at 100%, kill mob after mob till down to 10%, 
then sit down, your HP regens faster and faster the longer you sit, and 
adds up to pretty good numbers.

Bind wounds works to 70%, instead of the 50% it used to, so even if you 
were using nothing but BW you'd be doing 70% to 10%, instead of 50% to 
10%.. that means half again as much damage.

But BW works while sitting, instead of forcing a choice; this means it 
stacks with HP regen, so that 10% back to 70% will take less time than 
the old 10% to 50% plan.

And because, as I pointed out, HP regen accumulates speed as it goes, by 
the time you've done your regen+BW to get to 70%, you're barrelling 
along so fast that you might as well take a short breather and get back 
up to 100%.

100% down to 10% is more than twice the range of 50% to 10%!

Even so, recovering back up to 100% will take less time than we used to 
spend going from 10% to 50%.

Warrior (and other classes without healing abilities) are much more 
soloable than they used to be, back in the dark ages before the regen 
and BW revamp.
