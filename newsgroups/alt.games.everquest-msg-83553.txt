Hey all,
I got a couple questions for you awesome eq fanatics. First off, I have a 16
Druid who, although is a lot of fun to play, isn't doing it for me right
now. I like him a lot, but sticking to just one character ain't fun, I want
a bunch.
So, I decided that I am tired of going with a healer type. Also, I really
wanna solo, so I figure that narrows me down to a Magician, or a Necro (I
really want a pet for once that doesn't turn on me in a few minutes)
What are the pros/cons of these two classes, in comparison to each other. I
know the Necro is considered to be the soloing god, but why?
Finally, for these classes, what are the best races? I am thinking dark elf
for both, but I dunno if I want to go over to the dark side just yet.
Thanks for any responses or advice,
Chaos
