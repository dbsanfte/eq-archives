The guild I am in is run by a council of officers, of which I am one.  We 
seem to manage just fine, we've been steadilly progressing, and 
attracting a fair number of folks who are sick of full time raiding, but 
don't want to give up raiding completely.  All decisions regarding 
inviting people, granting full membership, deguilding, loot are made by 
the officers, not by an individual.
