I went to the SOE forums and found the answer to this one.  Or at
least, I found out how to change the color of the X's.  (There's
a set of RGB properties in the UI_character_server.ini file in the
[MapViewWnd] section.)  What's still a mystery is how they got set
to green on my wife's box.  I may never figure that one out!
