Nope, the "voluntarily logged out of the game" part is, since the
original poster had already said he was disconnected through no fault
of his own, so the guide was effectively calling him a liar.

That said, since the original poster by his own admission can't see
that calling someone a "retard" is either insult or harrassment, I
can't find a great deal of sympathy for him.
