>Im starting to hate spell research


1 thing I do is keep runes I dont truly need anymore and combine them
anyway for the chance of getting practice points.  Sell em if they get
trivial.  Then I use practice points to stay current but I usually
only have to use 1 or two practice points per level to stay current if
I keep creating spells that I might not even realy need.


What bugs me is that Im about to hit lvl 39 and was looking forward to
doing the Concussion spell quest.  However, initial research seems to
show that only wizards in thier early fifties are pulling it off.  

Of course I can beg my guild for numerous high level assistance but
why put out a spell at a level when it is unattainable by normal
standards.  Maybe, and I hope, I'm mistaken on my quest info.
