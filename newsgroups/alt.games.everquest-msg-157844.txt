The Hand of the Gods proc is irresistible and is designed to range from 70
to 150 points of damage. Since Clerics cannot Double Attack, all the Hammer
of Judgement does is simulate double attack - hence the higher than average
proc rate. In all seriousness, the hammer is just flashy.

That's why I called Cleric melee a 'scam.' It's no where near as good as
many people are lead to believe because of the proc.
