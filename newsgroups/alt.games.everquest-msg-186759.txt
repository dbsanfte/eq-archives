Hmm... this didn't thread properly... newsserver trouble a-brewin'...


From the shadows, the mysterious "Eric Lund"

conspiratorially whispered:

Well yes. But generally that's when there's personal problems starting
up. There was none here, we were talking about dreadlands and
experience modifiers, not exactly heated topics. B.H. might have been
kidding. I thought he was at first. But on reread it didn't seem as
obvious; he sounded fairly contemptuous actually. But then that seems
a bit extreme for the subject too. Given I couldn't be sure, I thought
I'd mention it in passing and see what happens next. :-p

Pfft. Wimp.
