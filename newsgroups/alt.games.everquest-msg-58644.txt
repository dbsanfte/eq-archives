No, they are seperate factions. Nothing that lives in the great divide
raises CoV faction when you kill it. Well, there is that ONE storm giant,
but he's red to my level 60, so not really a good target to faction
against.

Zone into skyshrine, cast invis, walk forward and target sentry enots or
sentry kcor...back away so they can't see you, and click your invis off,
then hit consider. They are on CoV.

Slightly more dangerous, but less of a run, is to get JUST outside of
wuoshi's aggro range (which is massive), and click on him.
