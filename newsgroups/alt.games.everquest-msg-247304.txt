A more comlplete, but still not fully complete, list of speeds, based on
lucy data, compiled January 2003. I'd update it if I needed to but I don't
play any more. Drogmar's run at the same speed as the similarly priced
horse.

These numbers are sometimes estimates, so be warned your milage may vary.


 So you want to move, well here's what moves you faster.

Note on Selo's: Bard songs are greatly improved by the use of even a basic
instument. At level 6 my friend's Bard with the normal cheap drum can outrun
my level 17 Shaman with SoW

There is no difference in speed of the various color horses.
