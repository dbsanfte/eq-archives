The commands you'll really be using for the most part are /pet attack
and /pet guard here, the rest of them really don't come into play very
much at all.  Even as levels go up you're never going to want to be
overly confident of your charm lasting, so don't grow attached to your
pets <g>.  Send em in and if they are still alive and charmed when fight
over park them so you have some breathing room when charm drops or you
invis to drop it.  /pet sit down is a very bad thing on charmed animals,
they will go tearing off across the zone, to their spawn point I've
heard, though I've never chased after them.  One final word of advice,
the rest I'll let you experiment with and find what works for you, but
always try to work with snared pets <G>.  It can be challenging to get
both pet and target together when your pet is snared, but boy when charm
breaks you'll be happy you made the effort.  Good luck on this, its
great sport and as a Half Elf (ie low wis) Druid I've found pets can be
a major help.
