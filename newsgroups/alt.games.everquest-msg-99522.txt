You are the only one that has the right idea.

I power level 45+ people all the time as a Druid.  HOW?  I take them
to a place that I can find quads like BW and pull 6 or more.  That
right 6 or more. They are all green to me so I can blow them all away
with one full bar of mana.  The 45~54 just sits in the middle of no
where and grabs all the exp.  At 45 these mobs are high blue to them.
At level 45 you can almost 3/4 blue bub after dropping 6 mobs.

Considering its a Bard that is even better.  Crank up the old mana
song and you are back in action in no time.

I have done this with a Bard and Necro on my other PC.
