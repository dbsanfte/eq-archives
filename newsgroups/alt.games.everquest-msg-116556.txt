I imagine there's much truth to this, but until BSA comes to us (very
unlikely, since we're legal with all the big stuff for sure, and we SHOULD
be legal with all the small stuff) I doubt if I'll have the opportunity to
find out for sure.

I can't understand how they could possibly audit us without our permission
or a court order though.
