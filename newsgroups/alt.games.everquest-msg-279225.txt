You can stop complaining about PoP now.  It's 3 years old.  Nobody cares
anymore, not to mention that due to changes over those three years there are
only a half dozen zones that are beyond the reach of a single group,
compared to the majority of them at release.

There have always been locked zones since the very first expansion.  Even
Sony realized they overdid it with PoP and undid huge chunks of it.  They
haven't repeated that mistake again, as GoD has a grand total of three zones
that aren't single-group accessible, OoW has one, and DoN has one that gets
unlocked *by* raiders for access by everyone.

Hardly.  Only fools and idiots think that they can't handle all single-group
content in the game.  Only bigger fools and idiots think that they should be
able to jump right to the hardest stuff in the game without working their
way up from easier content to the hardest content, equipping themselves
along the way.

I've *watched* non-raiders progress from NC to WoS to PG to RS, picking up
upgrades the whole way.  If they would have gone straight to RS, they'd have
had their ass handed to them and walked away sounding a lot like you...
