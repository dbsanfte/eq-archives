Some of the easiest to kill individually are the ones in East Commonlands
near the border to West Freeport.  The problem is that when you attack one,
all four come.  They don't have more than 600 hp, so if you really want to
see one of their corpses, once you get a 600hp DoT you can cast it on one of
them and run for the zone.  When you zone back, they'll either be back at
their positions or one the way back, with the one that was DoT'ed on his way
to his grave.  You won't get xp that way, but once you have them down to one
left you've broken the spawn and can camp them.  Alternately, if you can FD
pull one away from the pack, kill him and move the next.
