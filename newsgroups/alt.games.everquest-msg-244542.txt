As others have suggested, how about a "martial throw" (or "trip", or
some other name) that lets them briefly knock down a mob?  (A tick or
two where the mob is unable to attack and is an easier target as it
stands back up.)  If it included a way to physically move the mob, e.g.
to throw it further away from the cleric it was beating on, all the
better.

Or how about something that actually lets them leverage the Feign Death
skill in a group setting?  I'm always worried about using FD in a group
because the mob immediately heads after the rest of the party.  If I'm
the tank (happens sometimes, e.g. mage+cleric+monk) it's okay, because if
a fight goes sour I can hang on while the casters run for the zone, and
then I FD after they're safe.  Even if there's a better DPS in the group
so the monk doesn't have agro, the monk can sometimes take over after the
MT dies and fight a holding action while the casters boogie.  But given
the recent tendency toward fast fights (high-damage mobs), the monk's
lousy mitigation makes this harder.  So how about a discipline -- and
make it available before level 50, please! -- that gives the monk vastly
increased mitigation (and perhaps even some resists) and also increased
agro as long as he does NOT attack?  I.e., turn off autoattack, activate
the discipline, and now you're using your martial arts skills to keep the
mob busy to buy time for the rest of the group.  Maybe allow the "martial
throw" while running this discipline, but nothing that lets you directly
damage the mob.

I could even see this discipline working against multiple mobs.  You'd
only be raising agro vs your current target, but you'd be mitigating
damage from all comers, just like in the kung fu movies where the hero
takes on a zillion ninjas and none of them can connect. :-)

There, a couple of ideas for things that seem to fit with the "martial
artist" image (which is, as noted elsewhere in this thread, what the
monk class really is), that would make the monk more useful to a group.
