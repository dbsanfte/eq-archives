Netpal is spyware, and bad stuff... it's coming from your machine, not
Caster's Realm

http://www.doxdesk.com/parasite/NetPal.html

ad-aware, a spyware removal tool, can be downloaded at
http://www.lavasoft.de/support/download/

Netpal is distributed by virus/trojan, among other methods. I recommend
Virus scanning your system:
http://housecall.antivirus.com/housecall/start_corp.asp
http://security.norton.com/sscv6/default.asp?productid=symsc&langid=ie&venid=sym
http://www.pandasoftware.com/activescan/com/

Are all online free virus scanners. I prefer Housecall myself.
