 He didn't just "piss somebody off". He was abusive and violated his ISPs
TOS (Terms of Service). The would not have ganked his account if he hadn't
and/or there was not proof he did so. He did, and there was, so he was 
kicked. And that's the way it is supposed to work and it can happen to 
anybody that does the same thing.
 
 Are you new to internet or what? It's been this way for the 12 - 13 odd 
years I've been using it. Do you think the internet is some kind of lawless
place without any rules you can go to and be abusive to anyone you like?
The internet is policed by those that use it, namely us and I like it
that way.
