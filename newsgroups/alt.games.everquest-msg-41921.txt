I've seen wizards use AE snares in sebilis and other 'stacked' dungeons and
never had any ill results. AE snare is, too me, more valuable than single
target since it seems to have little downside (other than mana cost/cast
time...I'm not familiar with that).

I raised magicians from a 2 to 6 based on CoH. Translocates are incredibly
useful in so many different ways. Druids, for all their SoW ability, can
never get to Air or Hate by themselves. Buyable SoW potions, T/Jboots all
reduce the need to cast it yourself. Wizards get generally better portal
locations as well. No risk of running into hostile treants/druid npcs when
you are porting with a wizard. In light of all the travel capability they
DO have, I don't think that lack of spirit of wolf is enough of a drawback
to lower the rating.

Traveling through an area is substantially different from trying to haul a
body. Wizards have the ability to not be seen, but if they *are* seen, they
just add another body to pull.

Unless you are in an outdoor dungeon, the mob will likely catch up before
you get back to your group.

From my orginal post:
19)Pulling - Ability to grab stuff (peeling off singles out of fully
spawned areas, etc)

Also, wizards are second only to clerics in their total reliance on
meditating (harvest gives them a slight edge). Pulling = not medding.
Granted, the rating is supposed to not include wisdom considerations of
performing actions, but this aspect is too huge to ignore completely.

Howling stones and....? I have (easily) walked out of every dungeon in the
game that I've ever been to except HS, 1 zone out of 100+ is not a strong
consideration.

More reflects their personal rating. Else all pet classes would need to be
raised. I'll clarify the wording in the description.

Or just plain running out while "in the field". Necromancer faction woes
means that it can sometimes be a hell of a walk to the closest merchant
where they might have to buy something...IF they had to buy something.

Worst case: Buy the chips off a newbie...no non-magicians carry around
stacks of malachite.

CoH should be a factor here too, I hadn't considered it originally. Hmm. 4
sound fair?

>> When-The-Shit-Hits-The-Fan: 4...they can gate

>and then COTH other party members out.

CoH doesn't really do anything here. If you get a pull of 10, the mage
gating to the dungeon entrance *might* be able to CoH 1 person before the
wipeout is complete. I don't see any value here.

The other drawback is about the only way magicians have TO pull is an
offensive spell. That puts an excessive amount of aggro on them when the
mob gets back to camp, and thus can lead to wipeouts. MalX is a
possibility, but wasted mana when another class can pull so much better
(especially outdoors, where so many other classes have so many other
options).

FD a fair point. 9 works.

Shadowstep (and all its variations on all other classes) = poo.

175 platinum * 30 raiders = 5250 platinum. Not pocket change. Even with
guild support for funds.

If the necro is one of the dead ones, he won't be summoning anything
without a bank run.

I know lots of L60s of all classes who are flat broke.

Coffins only being available in Neriak is a real PITA.

New Summon Corpse is a grotesque mana hog. Velious robes can help, but
can't base a rating on the assumption that someone will have a given item.

It is my experience that clerics fold over only slightly slower than druids
when a mob decides to decorate the walls with the cleric's intestines.

Well, that is more a pulling category ;)

Fixed.

Relying on another class for travel is not a ratings enhancer :)

A fair point. Does require someone to DIE however, so the usefulness is cut
off a little. I've raised it off a 2 however.

Lack of dual wield, double attack. No primary hand damage bonus, and also
the tendency for clerics to have really terrible melee skills due to their
meditation-heavy nature all contribute to this.

Err, too you maybe. Enchanter, Cleric, Tank, and 3 others is the "classic"
group that I see all the time. Peculiarities of specific zones (or hunting
grounds within zones) can affect this.

I take it your cleric does not have it. Most useful item in the game, bar
none.

Since the charm line was whacked with the nerf stick, this has lost a lot
of value. And a buffed druid pet is still a joke.

Fair point. Fixed.

If I am in a situation where I need a porter, and the choice is between a
druid and a wizard (assuming that neither of them are doofuses, which is a
factor that is outside the scope of my rating ability), the druid will win
pretty much every time.

60 warriors taunt light-years ahead of 59< warriors. 60 warriors also can
triple attack.

Not as I define this rating.

New anti-FD code hurts monks. And as I recall, I don't rate anyone higher
than a monk, except for rangers outdoors, who are unequaled.

High level rogues rely on their evade key to keep from dying CONSTANTLY.

Taunting for a rogue is trivial.

60 rogues sneak at full running speed (or very near it).

They can evade something off themselves long enough to zone. Maybe ;)

Any number of hp above 0 at the end of the fight is "enough". Cleric
symbols and such are usually fluff buffs, and do little besides increase
the efficiency of complete heal.

Shamans and necros (and anyone using a mod rod in a fight) would disagree.
It basically stacks a chloroplast on top of any other regen you might have.
My shaman has been primary healer of MANY groups, and regrowth is a huge
factor.

I meant more from the statistic angle. Having their songs not hit pets is,
to me, a very minor drawback compared to the huge flexibility and power
available.

Thanks for the input.
