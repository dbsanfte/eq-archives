Kei exists because at one time they actually asked us chanters what we
wanted. If it did not exist we would be badgered incessantly for whatever
clarity did exist. We specifically asked for a clarity that lasted 5 times
as long but cost 5 times the mana so that people would leave us the hell
alone for much longer periods.

When I first started my chanter they where RARE . You might see one on a
continent and every one knew exactly where he was. GUILDS came to pester us.
While chanters are far more prevalent now , we still remember and dont
really feel up to a nerf thanks.
