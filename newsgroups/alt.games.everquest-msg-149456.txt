Funny thing, you know.  I'm pretty fluent in (*counts hastily on fingers*),
oooh, over two languages...

Lessee, there's Common, there's Dark Elvish, Dark, Elvish, Elder Elvish, and
Thieves' Cant.  That's...  Well, hell, it's a good few, anyways.

Wanna know what's weird?  *No-one can understand a blind word I say to 'em*.

Dunno why.  Seems to be getting worse, though - last few times I've tried
talking to someone it's been:

"can't understand u; switch 2 common" (like I can understand THEM...)

But I switch to Common, try again, and get:

"nope still can't unnerstand u", and so on until I get bored and wander off.

It's happened time and time and time again.  And I check, yes I do, I check
and I'm SET to Common when I start speaking to people...  Switching to
Common doesn't help...  And trying to pick an Elf and speak Elvish doesn't
have any more success.  Same whenever I've picked a rogue and tried Thieves'
Cant.  What I'm basically saying is that no bugg...  nobody understands me.
*sniff*


Right, that was yesterday.  Today it's even weirder.  Today, people are
walking up to me, saying hello or whatever, and I'm replying...  After which
they stand looking at me for a few minutes, mutter something along the lines
of 'suit yourself' and walk off.

I've gone from 'they can't understand me' to 'they can't hear me at all'...

Now I'm adaptable.  I can handle a situation like this, even though there
are no pens and paper in Norrath I could use.  But does anyone think it's
possible to live a full life in Norrath without being able to speak?  Cos
I've no clue what the problem is.
