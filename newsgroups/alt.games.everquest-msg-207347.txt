Well, you work to your strengths, given that duo, you probably avoid that 
type of mob as much as possible.  While shaman heals are not as good, 
they are still quite decent, I have had to deal with being the healer 
with unslowable mobs before, and it's mana intensive, but doable.  Also 
with the mob snared, if possible, and both player SoWed, you usually have 
the option of running.

There are all sorts of duos that do work well though, it's just a matter 
of picking the right places and mobs that work best with what you have.
