Well, then, I would say that Jim did indeed cover it pretty well.  Kill
stuff, loot it.  You can start venturing into Paludal Caverns from the Shar
Vahl side, and find plenty of mobs to kill at your level.  I soloed my
enchanter in there from about level 12 to now level 22.  The xp is very
nice.  The loot there is pretty pitiful, but then, the loot you will get at
that level is pretty pitiful most anywhere.
