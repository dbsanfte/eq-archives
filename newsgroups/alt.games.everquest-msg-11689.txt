I did 35-39 in OT in a matter of days with my mage.  If you're not bored of it
yet, I'd say stay there.  Crystal Caverns is another great place, but a little
harder to get a group there.

But if you have any means of water breathing and a partner, get your butt to
Kedge Keep and fight at the entrance.  You'll be amazed at how fast the XP is
there.

Good luck.
