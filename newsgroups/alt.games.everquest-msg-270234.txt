Wasnt this already a hotspot before?
Always had to leave around 15 cause my defensive skills began
to fall severely behind my levels.
If I remember correctly,I got 1 blue bar xp for a blue mob at 15,
close to 3 blues with a twinked char at level 9 or 10 for one
of the entrance mobs.

>Crystal Caverns 25-35
Again,xp here was unbeleivable good,hotspot or not,reason
zone is always empty (except the velium and gem farmers)is
the higher risk and longer journey to reach it compared to DSP
(crowd) or SBM (me).   :)

>Solusek's Eye 25-45
Very hard corpse retrievals,see comment below on SolB.

>Katta Castellum 30-60
Hm,this is a xp zone ?
SOE now recommends killing guards ?  :)
And what about the faction issues in Katta?
Will the next hot spot update include Sanctu Seru?   :)

>Nagafen's Lair 40-55
I doubt more xp will help to populate the zone,maybe if you
like sow speed charming mobs very near at zone in you can
benefit from hotspot xp bonus. :)
Why is a low level zone sooo much harder than any PoP zone?
As much as I dislike the idea of graveyards,this zone clearly needs
one more than any PoP zone.

>Umbral Plains 50-60
No complaints here.  :)
