Nexus porting is one of the happiest additions to the game for the non
porting classes.

I can't think of a guide offhand, but it won't take long to describe the
system:

There are five spires on Norrath with Nexus Scions.  Each works the same way;
you talk to the scion, which will give you the trigger phrase "journey to
lLuclin"
Saying this puts a Shard on your pointer, which you can put in inventory or
just
leave on your pointer if you like.  Periodically, (supposedly every 15
minutes)
the spires will activate, sending anyone standing inside with a shard to the
Nexus
on Luclin.

Sometimes, even if you -don't- have a shard on you, you will still be ported
up.

The spires also issue warnings as the port up time approaches, at 5 minutes,
3, minutes,
2 minutes, 1 minute, and "now becoming active".  None of these times should be

taken seriously, if you are ready for the port it will seem to take twice that
long, if you
aren't ready yet, it will seem like 10 seconds between announcements.

The Nexus zone, in addition to providing access to the rest of Luclin, also
features mini
spires, which will take you to your choice of the Norrath Scion spires.  Each
is in a
seperate room in the zone, with a Scion of its own standing right by the pad.
Antonica,
Faydwer, and Kunark have thier own pads, while Veliuos and Odus share a pad;
you need to listen to see which of the two will port down next.  There is no
shard
associated with this port system, just stand on pad and you go when it
activates.  It
does have a (similarly poorly automated) timer announcement to help make you
run
faster while seeking the correct pad.

The Norrath Scion spires are: North Karana (Anotica), Toxxulia Forest (Odus),
Greater Faydark (Faydwer), Dreadlands (Kunark), and Great Divide (Velious)
