There's one and only one exit (I believe), and there's no way for you to
reach it, so you'd better have a way of gating when you're done.  Also the
entrance has 2 critters that aggro you immediately and one will undoubtedly
see through invis (required to get past the scorps outside) because undead
are common in HS.
