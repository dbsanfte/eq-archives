> Just a question, why does AOL attract this type of user?

Because to use AOL the necessary skill set is , insert disk , and when the
funny rectangle comes up put your mouse cursor over the install key and
press the left mouse button . Our woefully inadequate public school system
is good enough to teach this skill to some of its brighter pupils .

To use many of the other ISP`s you actually have to go to arcane places like
system files and folders and enter numbers and thingies . This however seems
to be changing  at a remarkable rate . I got a wake up call the last time I
changed my ISP and the nice customer service person had easy and normal ways
to fedex or fly you a disk but stammers uncontrollably when you ask them to
read you the numbers and thingies over the phone line.
