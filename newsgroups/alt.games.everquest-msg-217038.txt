The main problem I see isn't that the cleric doesn't see me getting
hit, it's that the cleric usually doesn't know whether I'm in need of
healing when I do get hit. If the mob is slowed and I'm at 50%, no
need to waste mana on me, if the mob resisted slow and I'm at 50% then
I'll be begging for a heal. <g> 

Usually it only matters on multiple pulls, on single pulls the healers
can keep up but on big pulls, they're used to me offtanking adds so
they can concentrate on healing the main tanks. I usually do the
offtanking in our exp groups (outside of tier3 pop), a shaman can
usually keep himself healed in those situations and the group doesn't
loose any DPS on the main target when I'm offtanking.

I'm lazy and hate to switch hotkey banks and I just can't find the
room on my main bank to dedicate 2 hotkeys to cann5. Problem with just
having a macro for it is that I can't tell when cann5 refreshes if
it's on a macro.
