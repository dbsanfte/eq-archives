lol... yeah... back when Marus Seru was still awesome exp for me, I told
three friends of mine that it was a great zone... they grouped up and
started killing Stonegrabbers, one at a time, with significant downtime.  I
was not too far away from them killing the same mobs (red con to me), with
no more downtime than their entire group was having.  After the first couple
of mobs, the group leader sends me a tell, "You can SOLO these things?"

Beastlords aren't too awesome at PvP, though from what I hear they can be
given the right strategies, but I've never played a class as incredible at
soloing.
