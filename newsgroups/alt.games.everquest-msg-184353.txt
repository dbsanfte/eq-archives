You could try what I do - rather than risk minimizing, I get the EQW
startup (where it asks if you want to go to the patch login or not
etc) going for the second account before beginning the loadup for the
first. Then when the first is finished loading up all the way to
entering the world, I just need to alt tab to the first EQW window. I
can event watch what's happening on the account logged in while
loading up the second.
