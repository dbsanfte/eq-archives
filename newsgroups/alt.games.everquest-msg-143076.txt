It's difficult to recommend items for you when you didn't list your stuff,
and we don't know what you're concentrating on... INT and mana, or some
higher AC,  or maybe some more hp for allure of death and call of bones,
etc.

I would recommend just going to the bazaar and searching for stuff with the
stats you're looking for in different slots.  You'll probably find lots of
items you never knew existed; some of them might even be affordable.
