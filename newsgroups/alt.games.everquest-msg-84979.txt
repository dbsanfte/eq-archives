Wow.... and I thought "Anarchy Online was steep at $13 a month!
 That better be some premium service for $479.98 a year. Does that mean the
players paying the regular game will be treated to an even lower level of
customer service as all the attention will be focused on the "elite" few?
 I think this stinks a little of exploitation to me. Of course, if this
venture is sucssesful, will other MMORPG's be following suit and creating
their own servers for the rich?
Just my 2 cents....

Chris.
