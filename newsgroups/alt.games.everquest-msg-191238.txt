That part is fine. Certain technologies had certain failure rates. It
was enimic (?) to the technology.

The problem is when a product is the final result of a number of
tradeskills, it is almost totally impossible for you to produce it.

My example, converting rusty swords to studs.

If 100 is master, then chance of fail rate should be 1% at master for
something like metal bits, or breaking ore down into smaller pieces.

"The problem with EQ" is that too much of the game looks like it has
been decided by computer programmers with out reference to people who
knew "the real world" it is based on. The cartography (/loc) stuff is a
glaring example.
