I have enjoyed playing EQ2 so far.
The quests are a real hoot, there's no shortage of them and you can get
rewards from coin to weapons, armour and accessories.  Some quests are nice
and short such as deliveries, others require crossing several areas.

The tradeskilling is more involved than EQ1 and relies a bit on other
players at the moment, but given it's only been a month that can be
expected.
To gather components for your tradeskilling you need to harvest and use
different skills such as mining, gathering and trapping.  Each of these
skills go up depending on what you are harvesting, and to harvest certain
areas a minimum skill level is required.  You may choose just to be an
artisan and not adventure out at all, experience is independent.

I have found it hard to solo, particularly over level 13 where the mobs you
need to attack are built for groups.
My other half and I have grouped and have had relatively good success, of
course the more people you have the easier it gets.
On the grouping side however, a fair bit of discussion has gone on about
mages spell not being able to stack (summoners) and there being no use for
more than one ranger/predator in a group as their spells don't stack either.
Once you engage a mob in a group the whole group becomes "locked" and only
members of your group can attack them, so there's no KS'ing.  ont he other
hand if you run from the encounter you do not gain any xp from it.

The merchanting system isn't too bad either, mobs don't drop any money so
basically you get what you earn through quests and selling.
You need a room to sell from, and a merchant board.You can browse the market
from your room, and IIRC it's only your alignment unless you go to see a
black market broker (who charges a 20% fee) for stuff.

Players from different time zones are generally located on a particular
server, and there are role-playing servers too.  Most of the aussies are on
Najena, and I'm sure the other guys from a.g.e. can let you know where they
concentrated too.

Like EQ1, you get 30 days free gaming with your dvd or cd purchase.  Guess
you could always try it out, and give it the flick after 30 days if you
don't like it! =)

I should add SOE didn't pay me to write this...hehehe
