Heh - that's what EQWatcher is for:  "Mod rod up, time to use mod
rod" is what I hear every 5 minutes when I'm rodding.  Female voice
means it's my kitty, male voice means it's my mage. 

Also, I don't swap these spells.  I see them like Harvest and DA/DB -
you just have to have them memmed.  JayTee on the Tower made a good
suggestion - make it a 3 pt aa so that you don't need to take up a
spell gem for it.  However, I'll probably replace my DS (which I always
have memmed) with it - I've been letting the druid group DS us 
recently, rather than keeping a single on the tank.

Also, it is unlikely to be a group buff.  As someone pointed out to
me, it is a straight copy of the SK recourse buff.  Since SOE copies
and pastes spells, then alters them, we can assume they simply haven't
finished changing it.

You should try tanking with a couple of stunning pets - it is VERY 
noticeable when a mob stops hitting for seconds at a time.  Snare is
also cool - seems you just can't depend on the snaring classes all the
time.  I've almost hotkeyed "*COUGH* Snare is your friend" some days.

Since the stun is a proc, I'll be loving this - IoS+Girdle+Dexterity
and we could maybe get the proc frequency of my tiger (and he procs a
LOT).
