  When I first started playing EQ I was told to keep my 
Far Clip Plane at 0%, espescially in PoK and the Bazaar,
to keep myu computer from freezing up. It was months 
before I was reminded of the control, after which I
went on a tear of sightseeing.

  Among the things I enjoyed:

  Most of Luclin -
  Dawnshroud peaks, looking east from Maiden's Eye.
  Maiden's Eye itself, with its just-after-sunset
atmosphere.
  Sanctus Seru, looking like it's actually outdoors, 
and in daytime.
  Marus Seru, with all those mobs wandering around,
waiting to be pulled.
  Mons Letalis, with its exaggerated peaks. And the
sphere that leads to the MS zone; a soft-landed
planetoid, perhaps? How come it was moving too 
slowly to crater?
  The Scarlet Desert, looking like a section of Mars.
  Twilight Sea, a tropical-sunset scene.
  Katta Castellum - several people have noted its 
Gothic flavor.
  Grimling Forest. Makes me feel like a Smurf when 
I visit.

  And Kunark -
  Firiona Vie, particularly the statues of the Princess
and some nameless Iksar hero. 
  And the boat.
  Dreadlands, skywalking as a wolf, coming up on Karnor's.
  The Overthere, looking south from the Evil Outpost
toward SF.
  And looking into the canyon. Couldn't resist doing an 
Evel Kneivel over it.
  The Field of Bone, in the bonepit looking toward Kurn's.
And at the eastern edge looking south toward Kaesora.
  The Burning Woods, from high up, seeing the impact
craters and the trees all laid out.
  Frontier Mountains, again best seen from the air. My,
the Great Iksah Empah was like Rome in its fetish for
statuary and monumantal building, wasn't it?

  Velious, mostly Crystal Caverns, with winter-wonderland
mystique.
  And the glowing river through the Great Divide at night.

  In the classic game, Lavastorm and Dagnor's Cauldron.

  Haven't been far in the planes yet. Level 55 coming up, 
though...
