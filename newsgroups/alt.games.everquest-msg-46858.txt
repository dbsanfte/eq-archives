I beg to differ - STA is _very_ difficult to raise until you get Warlord's
armour or better. My Human Warlord, when buffed with Shaman STA, probably
has STA equivalent to an Ogre in similar kit without the buff -
Approximately 200.
No matter what the Ogre's starting STA is you just cant have too much of the
stuff because it has a tangible, linear effect at all levels.
