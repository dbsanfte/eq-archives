As far as I know, it would probably be an honor thing. I doubt anyone would pay
10k, but 4k would probably be reasonable. Anyway, the looter loots it, then
goes to the bank and pays the person. Assuming the looter is a high level
character and doesn't want to hurt his or her reputation and possibly get put
on an SL. Another possible way I can see is for the high level character to
give the person a valuable piece of equipment on his or her character at the
time and then trade the plat back for it--would be a lot safer obviously.
Anyway...
