Heh, actually had a level 53 magician sent me this tell a few
days ago after he'd been spamming the zone to do a character
swap...

/Magician tells you, "Hey!  Ever want to play a high level magician?"

Hmmm, let's look at the facts (as I know them):

Me:
--Level 60 Ranger
--Guildleader
--Very good reputation with the post-50 server population
--Very good reputation with the GMs
--Most skills maxed or close to being maxed (including the infamously
hard to raise Archery)
--Both Epics
--PoG Quest Helm
--Two pieces of Goldenleaf armor (one of which is the BP)
--Tolan Greaves
--Full spell book (including Call of the Predator)
--Good resist gear
--Decent amount of plat in the bank and some quest gems
--5 Essence Emeralds that I carry in case the guild needs to necro-rez a
cleric

The Magician:
--Unknown name/reputation
--Wearing a Shiny Metallic Robe and what I recognize to be mid-30s gear
by Povar's standards.
--Do not know if he has a full spell book for his level
--Do not know if he's maxed his skills for his level
--Do not know what he has in the bank

Umm, gee golly, trade a character that I love playing 
and whose gear 95% of Povar's ranger population would 
sell their soul for-- for a character in a class I've 
never had an interest in playing and with an unknown 
reputation?

/boggle

Amazing what some people have the nerve to ask, heh.  :)

Agallin, the "trade" you were offered smells like a scammer 
trying to pull one over on you.   You've every right to be
suspicious.
