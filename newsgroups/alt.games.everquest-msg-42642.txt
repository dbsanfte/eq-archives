Today while in unrest i accidently targeted something called herald of
mischeif.since i had never heard of it i was very curious. I found a few
people to con it so that i could get and idea of what level it was and it
conned red to everone except a level 58 knight i believe and to him it
conned blue. Its very hard to target. It doesnt seem to aggro on anything
its really well hidden. i never saw it but just targeted it and gave it some
stuff to see what would happen,(nothing did). does anyone know what this is?

also i also found a mystik portal that when you give stuff to it you get (i
don't need that so-and-so you may have it back) is this anything again it
actually conned the same as the herald so im thing about level 56 or so.
what are these things?

i can't find either on everlore or any of the other eq sites am i the first
person to find these?
