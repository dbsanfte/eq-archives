While it may be justice, that's a warnable offense.  Granted, there are some
porters who seem to go to the wrong place as a matter of course.  We've got
one in our guild.... great guy, but he does get the ports messed up.  You'll
see a tell "porting right over" followed by "where am I now....."  Granted,
this guy has a list of mob's and NPC's at every exit to every zone, since
tracking them is the only way he can find his way...
