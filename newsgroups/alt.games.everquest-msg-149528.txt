I haven't gotten around to getting the stats for the brand new ones, but
Celestial Heal is sort of a reverse DOT...health over time.  It's got a
level 14 (I think) version, and a level 59 one (quite a nice spell to cast
on a main tank right before he engages).

When a caster is being beat on in any 50+ dungeon, there's no way the Heal
Over Time will do more than the Beating Over Time that you're taking.

Divine Light is the upgrade to Superior Healing.
