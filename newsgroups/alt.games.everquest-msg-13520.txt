Informed? You had never even heard of a sniffer program!!! You may know a lot
about virus protection, but scant about how public every keystroke is that you
transmit.

You are the one who claims to have the universally accepted definition of such.
So, give us your reference.

You must be dense as lead--that definition PROVES my point, as a "script
kiddie" will not be able to sniff this stuff out. Christ, do you even know how
a sniffer works???

Refute this, troll:

She ignores the fact that your password can be intercepted not just by every
sys admin between you and the server, but if you happen to be on a university
campus, every hacker-wannabe who has access to a PC. She also ignores the fact
that if you have a cable modem, anyone on the same system with a little
software can read everything you spit out your line. She then talks about how
the password is sent "encrypted" like that is some major thwart to a PC fiend
over the age of 12. Go to Astalavista and do some checking on how many tens of
thousands of software titles--that verify your encrypted registration key is
valid--have been reverse engineered. Then to amuse yourself, look at the fact
that several of the programs have been cracked by multiple hacker groups, who
often race to see who can get the crack out the fastest.

Yes, what she considers to be an iron wall is a game to the people who really
know PC security. 

But, lets suppose you didn't actually want to reverse engineer the product and
come up with a scheme to unencrypt the passwords. I mean, why do it the hard
way, when you can use your copy EQ to give you someone else's password? If
someone wants to snag EVERYONE'S password that comes past them, they spend a
little time (like an hour or two) and pull out of the program the module that
encrypts the password you type before sending it. They spend another 20 minutes
modifying it so it will take input form a text file, and write it out to
another text file. The input file is a serious of text strings starting with
"a" and ending with "zzzzzzzzzz" 

Admittedly, it would take the average PC running a decent gen program a
whopping 30 seconds to create said text file. You then feed the text file
through the encryption scheme which was supplied to you on CD by Verant, and
produce ALL possible encrypted password in...oh, lets say Verant used slow
code, and you have a slow hard drive... 5 minutes. 

Now, the beautiful part is that EQ must transmit the passwords with the same
notification string every time, and as you purchased that string when you
bought the product, you set up your sniffer to look for that. Said sniffer then
kicks in, and your software records their user name and encrypted password. It
also goes through the arduous task of comparing your encrypted password with
the master list of all encrypted passwords, and approximately 1/4 seconds after
you hit enter, your username and unencrypted password is both being recorded on
their hard drive, and appearing on their screen.

Six hours later, as they figure you will not be playing then, they log into
your account and inventory it. Two days later they log in and empty everything.


Admittedly, this would take a decent hacker a few hours to do, but after that
long process, they just start collecting accounts.

Let's suppose, however, that your hacker in question isn't quite so stupid as
the one above. And, I do mean stupid--there was no reason to yank the
encryption modules out of the EQ game, when you don't even need to worry about
what the real password is! Who cares what it is--you don't need to know what it
is to log into their account. Every time they transmit their account name and
password, you can intercept that string, and record it exactly as it is. Then
when you wish to log in to their account, you simply transmit the same string.

It is all just zeros and ones people. If you send your zero and ones across my
path, I can record them exactly, and send the same configuration at my leisure.

The "expert" who ranted for line after line about how smart she was, and how
easy it is to make you PC bulletproof forgot that unless you have variable in
the encryption (user creates their own scramble key), de-encryption (dual key
system like PGP), and unencrypted text (i.e. you can't send the same message
over and over as you do with a account name and password), your data is only as
safe as the honesty and laziness of the hacker who wants your password.

They also forgot that the government and industry standard is that in order to
have your data be safe, no pc on your network can have the ability to connect
to the internet, nor have the ability to connect to a pc that can connect to
the internet, no matter how many times removed. Further, your PC is still
vulnerable to the workstations it connects to on the LAN.

Welcome to reality. 

For a good, basic overview of stuff like this, I would suggest reading "The
Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage" by
Clifford Stoll. Not only is it informative, but it is also a good read. On
Amazon.com, the average reader's review was 5 stars out of 5 possible. The link
is: 

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743411463/o/qid=991973339/sr=2-2/107-3229519-4099729

Of course, the "expert" we have in here is in direct disagreement with what
Stoll wrote. Of course, Stoll was only responsible for leading a government
task force that caught an international hacker spy who broke into the DOD
computers like they were candy...

You can protect your PC with increasing degrees of security, but anything you
send out is vulnerable to the entire internet.

Oh well.
