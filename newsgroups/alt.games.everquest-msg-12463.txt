I think I can believe the drugs in the water supply very easily. Here's 
a real story from before the addition of Jolt:
my monk (51) and a ranger (around 51 also) in Karnor. Every single mob I 
pull just about immediately turns on the ranger and proceeds to ass rape 
him in front of the amazed crowd. So I tried to figure out what the hell 
is going on.
Ranger's primary weapon was wurmslayer. Mine was the Wu stick. So speed 
of the weapons is out of the question
There's no way he was doing more damage than me, so that's out of the 
question
At some point he stopped snaring (it was not needed in that spot), but 
his ass was still thoroughly violated every time
Oh, and he was not hitting the taunt button, of course
So, as I could not explain it at the moment, I decided that someone did 
something entertaining to my sigarettes and chose not to believe my eys
