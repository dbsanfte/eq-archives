Well, they might be so easy you fall asleep, but other than that not 
really a problem.

The two biggest worries you'll have are the fact that many of them are 
rogues, and unlike most rogue mobs in the game, don't just get backstab, 
but also use their Hide ability.  Keep see invis of some sort up, or 
you'll end up getting jumped and backstabbed quite a lot.

The other problem is that Levitate type spells are disabled, so you have 
to run around a maze of narrow walkways with a fall waiting; worse, 
there are a lot of slippery spots; you might want to go practice on the 
ice skating rink in Thurgadin to get the hang of moving on ice.

Its an indoor zone, so no harmony; you'll be able to pull singles once 
you know the place just by avoiding the pairs... but they are social 
enough to add if close to each other.  If you are using root rot 
methods, though, I doubt you'll mind getting two.

The threads drop plentifully, but 75 minimum is a lot to collect even 
so, I'd personally reccomend finding some people who aren't doing 
threads themselves and grouping with them; this should at a minimum 
double, triple, quadruple etc your kills per hour, and if you are 
collecting all the threads that should help a lot.
