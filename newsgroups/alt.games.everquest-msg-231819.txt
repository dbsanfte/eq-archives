Stonebrunt Mountains are good druid territory. If you are short of cash, you
should collect all the cat pelts that drop there.

Last time I was there leveling a character, I put a few piles of foraged
bamboo shoots up forsale in the Bazaar for 6pp/each and they were gone in an
hour.

It is fast leveling because of the number of targets. Best I found was to
snare two animals, charm one and sic it on the other, then fear the target.
I seemed to find charisma made a big difference but it is debated quite a
bit. Just put one offensive spell on the target, like flame lick, then sit
down to med and wait to collect experience.

Lot's of places are good though. SK has gnolls that drop a lot of loot.
There are Wooley Mamoths that drop tusks outside of Halas.
