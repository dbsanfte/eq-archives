It's vaguely alluded to in Revelation 12.  Somewhere in the first 10 verses,
I think.  It doesn't specifically say that the devil was an angle, but it
does describe a battle between a dragon and his 'angels' against one of the
archangels (Michael, maybe, but don't quote me on that one).  After the
battle the dragon and his angels are cast out of heaven.

Let me know if that's wrong ... if it is, I'll look it up.  But I think
that's the chapter ... I know it's in Revelation somewhere.
