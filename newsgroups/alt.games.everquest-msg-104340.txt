I think there are quite a few people who view EQ as a sort of
graphical chat room and hate the messy part where the monsters hurt
you or even kill you.  Avoiding death is a prime consideration for
them.  Unfortunately for them, you have to kill monsters to level and
I think many of them choose support classes like cleric or even
enchanter under the mistaken impression that by sitting in back and
only casting on PC's, they won't draw aggro as much as the grunts in
the front line.  I suspect your cleric belonged to this group.

I grouped with an enchanter once who, although quite good about
casting Clarity on the casters and speed on the tanks, refused to mez
any adds because sometimes they would aggro on her when it wore off
and she didn't like that :)

The absolute worst player I've ever encountered was a cleric, though.
Whenever anyone in the group needed a heal, she was either AFK or oom,
but when there were monsters to be looted she was RIGHT THERE, boy,
looting away.  Personally, I suspect she didn't want to heal for fear
she would draw aggro.

One wonders if this type of player makes it much past 50.  You see
them in OT a lot, not so sure about DL but I suppose they're there
too.
