34 and still going
Majorly twinked and followed the same route to 34 as i did with my wiz 
to 36 so had that as an advantage, also got to 34 so much quicker than i 
did with the wiz now i have some experience at the game
Also it help that im a druid who dont die often anyway as long as they 
can snare a mob
Now im just getting into quadding so that and exploring new areas so i 
do think i will die soon
