The few mentions I've seen about it from Verant have implied that
knight-class characters (of unstated level) will indeed have a "summon
horse"-type spell; based on the "pet" code, I can't imagine that it
won't involve some sort of expendable spell component, but they did
seem to promise "free" horses to paladins and shadow knights. 

As far as "fair", I don't imagine that druids, bards, shamans or
rangers of a level sufficient to buy a horse would have any use for
one beyond roleplaying (roleplaying in this case being mostly "nyahh,
I have enough plat to waste on a horse"). Port/translocate/gate
classes may still find it faster to use their innate abilities for
transportation; it looks like the people left out here would be the
warriors and rogues. But at least they'd have less competition for
Jboots...

As for level, apparently paladins and shadow knights can start putting
experience into "the ultimate horse" at level 50 with the new
alternative advancement system; this implies that a "less than
ultimate horse" will be available before level 50.

As a side note, I'm wondering if a pet will gain the increase in
travel speed, or just trail along far behind (Jobober shouts "Hey,
master, wait for meeeeee!").

No telling, really. We're still seeing "new features" information at a
point well past where I'd assume the disks were already burned and
packaged; either the publicity machine is doling information out one
drip at a time, or that first Luclin patch is going to happen at
install and be a really, really big one.
