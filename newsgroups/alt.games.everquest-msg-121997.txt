Try grouping sometime and talking to your group mates, much easier to find
these things out if you talk to them.
Obviously I haven't grouped with the entire server population but I have met
plenty of other nationalities that way.

In that case maybe you should get out more because, to me, you seem to have
a select group of friends.
My friends who are into PC games and Role Playing would all of know him. The
ones who I go out with (a much larger and diverse group) I could name only 1
that would and another that probably would and the rest very unlikely.

Yes that was my comment because if I threw the name up here it wouldn't get
much of a reaction. Of course if I selected the right people (assuming I
knew something of them) then I could prolly get close to a 100% hit rate.

I have been at work and now they think I'm stranger than they did before. By
avoiding the ones I know will know of him I so far have 100% of No's,
although after mentioning his films (or at least his most famous ones due to
Western remakes) a couple have now said they know of him, just not his name.

Oddly I don't live there (and you don't live here) so I'd not know of his TV
weekends (not had one here as yet, to my knowledge) or film festivals. It
occurs to you may have more than a passing interest in his work, would
someone who has none pay any attention to a film festival or TV weekend for
him? Black and White, subtitled movies do not, in general, attract that much
attention from Joe Public.

The winning line for this argument (or losing in my case) is that fact that,
although I standby my statement that joe public would, for the most part,
not have heard of Kurosawa, the type of people that would become Guides, be
employed as GM's and in general, play online games would very likely be
fully aware of him and his works. So I concede that name wouldn't last long.
