So you're calling George Bush Sr. a liar?  I can't prove he wasn't
lying.  Only George Bush Sr. knows if he really felt that way at the
time or if it was "after-the-fact rationalization".

It's eerie, though, how George Bush Sr. seems to have accurately
predicted what would happen if we tried to "liberate" Iraq.  It's
pretty clear George Bush Sr. is a far more intelligence man than
George Bush Jr.

Of course.

And then there are presidents *cough* George W. Bush *cough* who don't
seem to learn from the experiences of previous presidents *cough*
Ronald Reagan *cough* when it comes to important issues *cough*
supply-side economics *cough*.

George W. Bush seems severely lacking in common sense.  Even after
almost four years into his presidency, he continues to have severe
lapses in good judgement on many issues.

I can't believe the United States is going to re-elect him.  *sigh*

Delaying the action in Iraq until we had:

(1) virtually indisputable proof of WMDs
(2) built a real coalition - not the joke of a coalition we have now
(3) had a solid plan to win the peace

is common sense.  It is not appeasement.

It's not outside the realm of possibility that I'm an artificial
intelligence program written by the Martians that live underneath the
surface of Mars.

Damned unlikely.  But within the realm of possibility.

I think it's terribly unlikely Iran would have attacked Iraq.  And I
think you think that, too.

If the shoe fits...

You have to admit George W. Bush has made consistent critical errors
as president.  He has not displayed good common sense or any kind of
forethought.  And he's not getting better.  I could see a few missteps
early on in his presidency as he gained experience as president...
But he just doesn't seem to be getting any better.  During the first
presidential debate, he couldn't even offer up any plans for dealing
with Iraq.  He just outright lied and said "we're making progress"
which in my opinion is demonstratably false.  Unless he measures
progress in terms of number of American troops killed...  Apparently,
ever greater numbers of dead American troops is progress.

When he's re-elected for another four years, I, for one, expect "more
of the same".  *sigh*

I don't necessarily agree with McCain's policies, and I'll admit to
being a democrat for the most part, but I think it'd have been much
better to have him as our republican president.  I think the vast
majority of democrats and republicans would agree with me on that.

I don't agree.  I think it's more than possible to have a puppet
president.

A lot of people may assume that to be the case, but I just don't see
it.  I view it as an urban legend.  A meme that has caught on with the
American public that just isn't true.

I can only express shock and horror that you actually think George W.
Bush has an even *remotely* good foreign policy.  I don't know what
else to say.  It's just too hard to believe.

I guess it depends on how you define "God", which can be drastically
different from religion to religion and person to person.  I don't
think Christians have a monopoly on God, as you seem to suggest.

Ultimately, I feel Christians are misguided.  They've placed their
faith in a book - which I think has been adequately proven to be
written by man and man alone, and not divinely inspired - when I think
they should have faith in God instead.

To assume that God has created a world in which the vast majority of
people will go to Hell for *eternity*, many of them for simply "not
believing in Jesus", is self-evidently ludicrous to me.  It shows, in
my mind, a rather strong LACK of faith in God, to believe his plan for
us would have such a high failure rate.

I think what makes most religions popular is they give people easy
answers, and people like easy answers.  I'm not saying the Bible is
easy to interpret, but I'm sure it's very comforting to Christians to
"know" the morality in the Bible is *the* divine morality God wants.

I don't think God gave us the gifts of free will, intelligence,
emotions, the senses of right and wrong, etc. so that we could ignore
them in favor of the often rather bizarre "morality" you see in the
Bible.  It's like giving someone a tool, such as a screwdriver, and
then telling them to not use it.  It makes no sense.

Back to the "people like simple answers" point.  I think evidence
proves out most people like simple answers.  It's why George W. Bush
was elected, and it's why he'll be re-elected.  He gives simple
answers.  That they're right or not is irrelevant.  They're simple.
"President Bush says Iraq is under control and progress is being made,
President Bush says the economy is recovering, President Bush says
he's a man of faith."  It's all so simple and uncomplicated.  It's
terribly alluring.  It's not wonder people latch onto it.

But I think the world is complicated, and I think we'd all be better
served by having thoughtful men as our representatives who respect
people enough to explain that no, things aren't simple, and yes,
they're complicated, and here's why, and here's my plan, and here's
why I think it'll work.

I don't think Kerry is any grand prize, but I think he'll display much
more honesty and respect to the American public, and be much more
thoughtful about the actions he takes, and get us into less
disasterous messes, like Iraq.  I don't like the dumbing down of
America that I see happening all around me.  I want people to
understand that George W. Bush is not just a bad president, but a very
bad president, and he instills bad habits in all Americans, by getting
them addicted to "simple answers".

For this particular election, I feel it's my civic duty to my fellow
Americans to vote against George W. Bush.  And for this election, it
means I have to vote for Kerry.  I want to wake America from its
slumber and it's increasing addiction to "simple answers", because
it'll destroy this country.

Whoops, better get off my soapbox, sorry.
