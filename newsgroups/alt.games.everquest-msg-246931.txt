Well figuring your email was sent on a Thursday  - expecting a big company
to respond in 1 or 2 days especially heading in to a weekend is set with
extremely high expectations. Plus the factor even if they did get the email
they probably have to see whats wrong with the account and review it any
way. I myself would expect something after about 4-5 days (minimum an email
saying we are reviewing your request - something to that effect)

The fact that you sent 99 emails (if you did) can seem obnoxious and
probably moves you to the bottom of the pile - too much persistence can make
you look like you are a nuisance pushing for something you shouldnt get. I
would say after i would get 3 or more emails from someone I would either
start deleting the others or ignore them all together. I wouldnt give up on
helping, but you would become an irritant rather then a customer (not saying
this is right but is normal behavior)

Im not sure how easy it is to get banned (im sure its not) but that may have
a big purpose in your problems

Just my 2 cents
