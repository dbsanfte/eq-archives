I was curious as to whether any class can do another class's quest from the
level 30's series of quests? Let me explain what I mean by that horribly
confusing question. ;-)

For example. The Bracers of the Reverent. They are cleric bracers. Can any
class successfully complete it? What about the Incandescent Mask for
enchanters?

I know that they are class specific items. I don't want to wear them, with
my druid. I want to find out if they can be completed by any class.

Thanks for the help.
