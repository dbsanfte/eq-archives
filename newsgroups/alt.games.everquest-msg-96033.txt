    I doubt you have anything as broken as a Manastone. The thing has zero
casting time - you're only limited by how fast you can click as to how fast
you can regain mana with one. Let's give it a 1 second casting time, and see
how fast we can get back mana, shall we? I'll assume a cleric who can afford
to eat away 3000 HPs (I'm well over this now with buffs and I suck, so it's
reasonable), and who always fails the specialization roll when he Complete
Heals himself.

50 casts of Manastone kills 3000 HPs (60 HP to 20 MANA), gives 50x20= 1000
MANA.
Complete Healing himself takes ten more seconds, costs 400 MANA.

Net: 600 MANA in 60 seconds, or a sustainable recovery rate of 60 mana/tick.
Max med rate is 25 mana/tick.

That is ba-roken, and that's WITH a nerf to the stone and with the person
stoning not sitting to catch the medding every tick. If the cleric sat for
one second after every five casts so they'd also get the benefits of
medding, you'd get 10x25 + 50x20 - 400 = 850 mana in 60+10=70 seconds, or 72
mana/tick. Even if you restrict clerics from being able to use it, a cleric
could always heal someone else using one. And if that person had the ability
to transfer mana back to the cleric, like a mage or necromancer could....

    Unless the casting time was upped so much that most folks wouldn't want
one, the Manastone will never be allowed in "modern" EQ again. It is the
Channel of EQ items (for those that used to play Magic: The Gathering) and
is just as broken.
