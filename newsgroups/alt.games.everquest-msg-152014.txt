Ummm, your a warrior, not a magic user. No magic for you! Just killing and
taking the punishment.

If this is your first EQ char, then you'll probably make a few more before
you find the one right for you. The more you play EQ the more you'll
understand about each classes pros/cons.

IMO, a bard is probably one of the most complicated classes to play. They
have a little bit of all worlds, and good bards can make a difference in a
group, espcially a bard who can twist multiple songs. Perhaps a bit
overwhelming for most new players, make a char and give it a try!
