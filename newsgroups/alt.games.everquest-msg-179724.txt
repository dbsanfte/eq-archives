These are Trolls you are talking about, I dont think they could manage
such a sentance.

How about a little Troll poetry:

"Kill da froggie, Kill da froggie!
Froggie took me home,
Kill da froggie, Kill da froggie!
Me live wid Inky,
Kill da froggie, Kill da froggie!
Froggie gonna die alone,
Kill da froggie, Kill da froggie!
Inky learn me good,
Kill da froggie, Kill da froggie!
Froggie die by me Stinky,
Kill da froggie, Kill da froggie!
Gonna get back me hood!
Kill da froggie, Kill da froggie!"

Sigh,  I was just thinking of starting a Troll, Innothule used to be a
pretty good newbie zone, the DE one sucks...
