Well you could have both INT and mana, assuming you're a Solusek Ro
worshipper. The Solusek Ro imbued jewellery is quite nice, provided you
can afford to lose some strength:

Imbued electrum fire opal ring, AC 2, STR -4, INT 4, HP 10, mana 25, sv
fire 2

Imbued gold fire opal ring, AC 3, STR -6, INT 6, HP 10, mana 35, sv fire
3

Imbued golf fire opal ring, AC 4, STR -8, INT 8, hp 10, mana 45, sv fire
4, BRD, WIZ


Of course, you'd probably have to supply some pre-imbued gems to your
friendly neighbourhood jeweller, and good luck getting the spell if you
don't have it (its only available from a merchant in Nagafen's Lair who
spawns when Naggy is killed. Also, according to Casters Realm, its
bugged (dunno if its fixed yet) so the spell consumes a fire emerald
(not a fire opal) and returns an imbued fire opal.

You can make up for the strength in other slots, e.g. swap out your
+5INT necklace for something like a platinum sapphire necklace
(+7INT/+7STR), or a velium sapphire necklace (+8INT/+8STR).
