Heh... I wouldn't put it past 'MSN' either.

But then whole blocks of customers wouldn't be able to reach eachother. 
This would probably come up pretty often. Moreso than re-using some 
space in a class A net that was assigned to someone who barely uses it 
back in the 70s.

The urgency is definately gone... but IP has a number of limitations. We 
can't use it 'forever'.

Probably. But then much of EQ is 'interesting/completely fruitless'. :p
I'd have a row with tier2 or 3 tech support just for the entertainment 
value.

FWIW, despite the original posters assertions I'm somewhat skeptical of 
the claim that he's NATed with real hijacked ips. How was this 
ascertained? Maybe its just SPI firewalled... what addresses is he 
getting, and who are they registered too? Maybe they're just NATing the 
ipsapce allocated to them, in which case they're is nothing technically 
wrong with that.
