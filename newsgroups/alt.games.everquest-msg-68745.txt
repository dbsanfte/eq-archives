	Prevailing when the numbers indicate you should not.

|Quad kiting takes some skill, is that playing above average?

	I don't think quadkiting takes skill; I think you could probably write a
bot to do it.

|AE groups take some skill also (normally).

	Likewise.

	I don't think any game activity that is done often enough to earn a name
is particularly noteworthy.

	I agree.  I've felt sorry for most of the "boss mobs" my guild has gone up
against.

|What then? Killing the AoW and similar
|mobs that are currently considered tough is the only thing that counts as
|high-risk?

	Pretty much.  If there isn't a serious chance that you will wipe out, it's
not risky.

	Nothing.  If people do it regularly, it's not high risk; it can't be or
they'd get pasted.

|Almost nothing that people do day to day in EQ is risky at all in that
|sense. If you don't think there's a very high chance of coming out of a
|situation without being up exp or loot wise, you simply don't do it.

	I agree.

|If you are rating exp-gaining groups on a 'risk' scale,

	As far as I'm concerned, the former denies the latter; you do not gain EP
engaging in risky activity.
