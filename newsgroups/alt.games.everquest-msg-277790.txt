On EQ, sure you can put lore in shared bank and switch it around. In
fact, it doesn't even count as you holding it if it's in the shared
bank (i.e., you can have one in the shared bank and one in your per-
sonal inventory/bank slots at the same time.) But, IIRC, the poster
mentioned EQ2. No clue if it's different there since I haven't played
that.
