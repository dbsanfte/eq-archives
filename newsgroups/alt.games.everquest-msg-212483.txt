Actually Ed, that is limited by the environment your program lives
in.  If your program is dealing with anything that has a real-time
component (data capture, hardware control, etc.) there is no way
to debug it without changing its environment.  Further, even in a
high level environment there are sometimes hidden real-time issues.
Hell, just enabling the debugger typically causes your code to be
compiled differently, which means you aren't actually debugging
the same program that has been/will be released, just a reasonable
facsimile thereof.  Most of my work is done with embedded systems,
so I am acutely aware of this sort of thing.
