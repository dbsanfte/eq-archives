You may want to read up a bit on both physics and the problems archers have
getting good aim firing very high and very low.  I used to bow hunt, and it
is much more difficult aiming high or low, not to mention that the target
profile is radically different.  That does not excuse the "too high/low"
issue, though. There should just be to hit modifiers to compensate.

I really don't see a huge issue with bow damage at lower levels vs
toe-to-toe melee damage.  It's just much easier to do a lot of damage
toe-to-toe thatn use a bow effectively.  With a bow of equal ratio to H-t-H
weapons, the damage output can be close, as long as you keep mashing the
Range Attack button.  That is the real issue.  There should be some ability
to auto-fire.  That would make bows more like long range 2H weapons (which
they are).
