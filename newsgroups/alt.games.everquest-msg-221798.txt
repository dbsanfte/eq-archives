Actually, while that is a resonable sounding answer, the 2nd survey
actually uses the wording 61,000 women were victims of a rape. Not
sexual assault.. rape. I kinda thought it might have been the same
thing when I was looking at the BCS, but that's not how the 2nd survey
was worded at all, which is why I brought it up.

Not vastly lower... See above. And again, even if it's only the lower
of figures,  it shows an alarming trend of growth in the last 20
years. from 16X as many rapes per capita 20 years ago to only 3X
today. And the number of rapes in the US is actually falling.if I
remember reading the UCS correctly.

The UK has made it just as easy for criminals to get guns. That's the
crux of my argument. The criminals in England are armed if they want
to be, but the citizens aren't. That's a pretty bad situation for the
LAC (Law abiding citizen) to be in. The goblins aren't going to obey
the gun laws. Hell, they're already criminals! Who cares if they add a
posession charge to a breaking and entering, rape, or murder charge?
It really makes it easy for them to perform heinous crimes. 

>There is no way to remove guns from circulation, 

Same in England. Except for the LACs.

>therefore people have to have the means to defend against them.

And in England, they have very little means to defend themselves. Ever
read about the farmer who actually had a hidden shotgun in England and
shot a home assailant? Here...
http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,6119,2-10-1462_1419723,00.html.

Imagine! 2 thugs invade your home. You defend yourself. YOU go to
jail! In Texas, we'd have ginven the guy a medal for taking 2 goblins
outta circulation! But in England, 1 is taking a dirtnap, while the
other SUED the farmer!

False. 
http://www.guardian.co.uk/gun/Story/0,2763,1056412,00.html

>The

Truth in that. but a gun isn't a difficult weapon to create. It's very
simple in fact. You can't put the genie back into the bottle. England
is a very good example of this.

>

I conmpletely agree.

That the media is underreporting?

>

Unfortunately, you have a very good point. But you're also making MY
point. I still contend that a person has the right to carry, and when
the govt of whatever nation prohibits that right, it's criminal.
Dictators LOVE disarmed people and fear an armed populace. Look at
Hitler as an example. 

>I would prefer therefore 
>that guns remain illegal in the UK.  

You just contradicted yourself. Because a LAC is less likely to be
prepared, they shouldn't be allowed to defend themselves? What sense
does that make? Why deprive the person who WILL be prepared because
another might not?

>Making guns illegal in the US

My point in that is that Inner city violence where one drug dealer
kills another is not neccessarily a bad thing. I really dont' care if
they kill each other. I DO care, however, about any collateral damage,
such as innocent passersby. But if those innocents were armed &
prepared to defend themselves, the drug dealers would have been sent
packing long ago. I've actually seen it happen. A frind of mine has a
stepfather who cleared out a crack house on his block about 10 years
ago. He strapped his pistol to his waist and went & had a little
"talk: with the,. They relocated. Note: I do not condone his actions.
I thought it was a singularly stupid thing to do. But he did it and
they left.

I appreciate your thoughts, and respectfully reserve the right to
disagree. Sorry if I've been short in a few of my earlier posts. I've
been making the same arguments on other NGs for years, and find this a
little repetitive at times. My fault not this NGs.
