Hi,

The Lag in game if you are referring to ping times has no dependence to
bandwidth available
as long as you exceed the minimum bandwidth requirements of the game.
Everquest can run
on a 28.8 modem happily ;o) what does determine the lag factor would be how
long does it
take my packets of data to reach the servers and how long do they take to
respond.
If I am on a 100Mbps connection to the internet I can send shed loads of
packets.. but If I have
many slow hops to reach the destination I will still experience Lag in game
even though I can
transfer large amounts of data across the link (latency). In other words the
size of the connection
(as long as you exceed the games minimum requirement) has nothing to do with
this type of lag.

Hope this helps,
