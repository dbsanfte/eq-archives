???

I assume you mean you cannot log in, and that you do not mean you cannot log
chat. :)

The patch message gives you the way to fix it, but perhaps if you cannot log
in you do not know how to look at the patch message!  Ahhhh

Here is the information.  I got it from Verant's message board:

** For those having problems logging in **

If you are having a problem that causes you to be kicked out of the game
after selecting "Play on line", there is a solution to this problem.


Delete the file "bmpwad6.s3d" from your EverQuest directory.


This should solve the problem.

However, if you find that you are still having the problem and you have
previously edited your eqclient.ini file in order to test out the DX8 DLL,
then you should be able to fix the problem by:

Edit the line in your EQClient.ini in your EQ directory from
"GraphicsDLL=EQGfx_Dx8.DLL" to "GraphicsDLL=EQGfx_Dx7.DLL".

We apologize for any trouble this may have caused some of our customers.
