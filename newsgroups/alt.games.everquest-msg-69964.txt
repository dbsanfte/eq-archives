You mean like a Clerics healing, that's mostly needed by tanks? Or a chanters
clarity, mostly needed by other casters? Or a monks FD ability, needed
by all people on a major raid? Or tanking ability of melee classes, needed
by any non tank?

These might not be a 100% dependency, but the game is group/interaction
designed. There's a reason a class can't do everything without the other
and I think it's quite ok this way :)
