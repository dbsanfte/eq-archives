Just to play Devils Advocate, do you think your friend has had bad
experience of Tanks getting mobs worked up, not pulling back enough to stop
aggroes and being left to die by them?

When I use my Enchanter, I am forever having to shout for the Tanks to pull
back. High Pass Hold being a prime example of this. Whenever more spawn,
they are straight in on top of the group. Tanks can take a few hits over the
head, Casters cannot.
