Greetings all,

I would like to start an everquest 2 newsgroup (alt.games.everquest2), but
unfortunately my ISP does not allow the sending of control messages. Could
someone with the capability of sending this type of message please contact
me. I may be contacted at jklproductions@hotmail.com.

Thanks in advance.
