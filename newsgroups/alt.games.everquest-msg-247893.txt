On many machines, particularly of the *nix persuasion, it is actually 
pretty difficult for the owner/admin to get the user's password.  That's 
why if you lose your password, they frequently can't tell you what it was, 
but can set a new one for you.

But that's not universal, true, and a competent hax0r can probably figure 
it out anyway given root access.
