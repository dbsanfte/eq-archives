Didn't know that.  Had gathered the impression that against big
targets Manaburn was the "best" option, at least in the opinion
of some folks, but did not realize that that assumed unlimited
mod rod use.

Won't it still be worthwhile when fighting mobs that substantially
increase their damage output when they're at low health?  Or is that
what you're referring to here?

Well, in a way that's too bad.  Seems kinda stupid to have all these
gear based enhancements to spell casting and then say "oh, but if
you're a healer only your lesser spells can be enhanced, sorry".

Thanks for an informative response.
