Not being hand fed the entire way, learning your class / others classes and
what they can do, learning what mobs do, learning how to raid, learning raid

HEAL etc...

 Heh, twitch is just reaction's, you can't learn that, EQ requires some
twitch but alot of knowledge, knowing what to do and when, doing something
wrong can kill an entire raid (hatchet for example).
