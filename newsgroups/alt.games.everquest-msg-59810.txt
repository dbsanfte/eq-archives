Have you guys tried killing Malalafen?

Just a word of warning:  Mega DiscipleOfKerafyrm faction hit (one kill
goes from indiffernt to scowls), however, unless your GM perma-kills
him (like ours did), you don't really HAVE to farm ST for months on
end to get those quest items.  :)

Was that a subtle enough of a hint?
