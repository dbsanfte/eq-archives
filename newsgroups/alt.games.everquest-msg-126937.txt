Oh my god, you shoulda heard the bitching in GFay on test tonight.  30 
newbs running around the exact same area and people are bitching that 
"there aren't any level 1 mobs left".  I yelled out a few times that 
Butcherblock was all but deserted, then gave up in disgust and left.  
I'd have understood if it was new people coming in, seeing the lack of 
mobs, and complaining once, but some of these people were literally 
listing off all the mobs they saw that they *couldn't* kill after I'd 
just finished mentioning BBM AND pointing out the crowding.  /ignore 
OOC. :p  The druid guild in Rivervale is a bit of a run from Freeport, 
but at least it'll (hopefully) be quiet as usual in East Free.
