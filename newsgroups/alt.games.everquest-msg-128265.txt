In case you think I can't see the up side

Hotkey one*
/song one
/song two
/song three
/usebutton 1

Would be ever so ever so nice.  Assuming hotkeys
were set up so they were easy to interrupt, say by
starting another hotkey, I could make several banks
each with a nice twist on it, and have the most relaxed
bard ever

40 bard, Morell Thule

* yes I know that stopsongs and pauses would be needed
to make this work... its just a fantasy though so I thought
I'd use the fantasy /song command, which would naturally
be a UI command meaning "stop the previous song if one
is running, then pause long enough for server update at my
current connection speed, then start the song in question
oh and while you are at it I think my litterbox may need changing"
