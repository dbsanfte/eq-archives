My bros summoned hammer is too good...no cleric should wield such a weapon
:/

Spending alot on a weapon wont really improve your damage a agreat deal
instead of:

Miss
Miss
12
Miss
5
2
Miss
Miss

You would have:

Miss
20
Miss
Miss
4
7
Miss

Etc, when you get your procing hammer that will change though.
