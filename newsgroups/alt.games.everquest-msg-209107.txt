No help needed my friend, I personally play EQ for about 4hrs per night and
8pm-midnight weeknights and weekends, (two movies on Sky takes longer than
that) - no trader mode (ain't got anything worth selling ;)), what makes the
difference is both my sons also play EQ. One used to use the same dial-up as
me the other used another ISP, they are limited to two hours per night each
(after they've done their homework) - it all adds up when there's more than
one person using the dial-up.

Oh and non of us are "addicted I-with-no-life people" but thanks for your
concern ;-)
