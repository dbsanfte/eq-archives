It is possible to say that up till this point they have been bad 
randomers.  However, the beauty of a random system is that their past 
history is irrelevant, this next roll they have exactly the same odds as 
everyone else.  Lost a hundred times before, a thousand times before, it 
doesn't matter, this next time they are neither favored to win nor to 
lose based on their record.

More amusing, the fact that some people have had a run of losses tends 
to make them keep a bad loss record, because they opt out of the 
randomizing system whenever possible.  Those who have won a lot tend to 
favor randomizing systems even though their chances of winning in the 
future are no better than that of anyone else, so big winners tend to 
gradually average down into average winners, but big losers avoid 
rolling as much as they can, so while they gradually tend to average up 
into average losers, they do so much more slowly.

That said, however, I must accord my feelings on this matter no more 
force than a religious conviction or superstition.  I don't believe in 
luck (which is to say, randomness shaded by fate or destiny or some such 
apparent nonsense) but can't provide proof in a finite universe any more 
than I can prove the nonexistence of that farcical being referred to as God.

Splendid One, 56 Gnomage, Firiona Vie

ps, unlike me, Splendid believes very strongly in luck, or rather, that 
fortune favors those closest to the ground... watch him carefully and 
you'll see him click off levitate before any roll he wants to win.  If 
there are other gnomes present he might even use his summoned rings to 
raise their spirits, just to improve the odds.  Brell helps those who 
help themselves!
