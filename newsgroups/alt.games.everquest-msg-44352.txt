Well, i have done a few trades where the person in question need the stuff to
another char, i dont mind transferring it to the other char too. Trade a lot, and
am an officer of my guild, so cannot in any way afford to get a damaged
reputation, so peope know theyre safe with me after doing a /guildstatus.
But I wouldnt trust anyone else to pay me from another char. If they want the
item on 1 char, and pay me from another, they can log their paying char in first,
then ill hold the item for their other char.
