What you can do is list all the files in your current instalation sorted
by date, and save the most recent 100 mb to the zip drive. Then
reinstall as normal in the new computer, and copy back those 100mb,
overwriting as necessary. Or else, if you don't mind spending a little
more money, since you have USB in both computers you can buy a USB
networking cable... Tons faster than null modem cable.
