Lucy lists the 5 tiers of Swift Arms as 21, 26, 31, 36, 41 percent
haste.

The common perception is that tributes act as worn effects.

To test this I did 3 tests - I equipped my BL (no DA aa's) with
a 2hb, 40 delay weapon (summoned staff of tracing) and ran short
tests (around 2 minutes each) of him swinging on my mage's pet
(pet hold on, so the BL wouldn't riposte).  My misses and hits
were turned on.

Test one resulted in a ~40 delay 
which matches our expected value (40 * 1/1.0) 

Test two, 31% haste item resulted in ~31 delay
which is very close to (40 * 1/1.31) and is the expected value

Test three, 31% haste item, Swift Arm 5 (41% haste) resulted in
a delay of ~28.  This is very close to (40 * 1/1.41)  and nowhere
near (40 * 1/1.82)

Therefore we conclude that Swift Arm counts as just another haste
item and the highest of the worn haste items and/or Swift Arm is
used.

This is also true of the focus effects.  I haven't tried with 
bard instruments yet, but I would wager the pattern holds true.

So, the basic rule appears to be - if that effect on an item wouldn't
stack with what you're wearing, it won't stack as a tribute effect.

So, this brings up the question - Who are tribute effects aimed at?

High end players likely have most of their focus effects, high
enough haste that VoG caps them (VoG = 68%, 31% haste items go
for as low as 20k on Lanys = 99%.  Cap is 100) and have capped
their essential Stats.

That leaves FT (which many are capped on), +150 hp and the 
plus resists.  For bards, the option of having all instruments
covered without swapping might be beneficial as well.

The vast majority of the effects seem to be aimed at the mid
range players.

Did SOE actually consider their target market when they created
these?  If they nerf TP returns enough so most items approach
the 1PP/1TP lower bound (set by the TP value of a PP) most people
who would actually benefit from these effects will be unable to
afford them.

I really think they should have left the easily farmed items (FS,
Velium, etc) with enough TP value so a player could get enough
TP in 2 hours to last the next 20.
