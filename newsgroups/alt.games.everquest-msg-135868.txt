Depends...  Are you going to start viscious attacks on my wife and
kids??

If you do, then yes you get the USENET Terrorist label.  Because it
shows you have a terroristic mindset...

Seems that is your gambit.. I have made point after point re: your
inconsistent attitudes..

Your response has been, to a T.....   

"I did not say that"

W/o providing ANY factual basis to back it up..

While it might not be word for word what you said, the meaning is
clear..

Much like the meaning was clear re: that Lesa post.. Everyone got it
but her. 

And THAT is because she did not WANT to get it..  

If she got it, she would have to address it.  But she couldn't address
it w/o admitting that her posts make her out to be a hypocrite...

So it is with you.  

Within the same post, you say that USENET posts are irrelevant in the
real world and can cause "little or no harm".

Then 2 paragraphs you claim that you would be happy to ignore me, but
I can make your life harder by my USENET postings.. (lemme get your
EXACT words and see you weasel out of it...) 

"I said, I'd be happy to ignore you, but ignorant idiots like you make
it harder for me to enjoy my life."

So, making your life harder does you little or no harm, right??

Ergo, you won't mind me continuing my USENET crusade, right???   :^)

Go ahead... Yer allowed to weasel and waffle now..
