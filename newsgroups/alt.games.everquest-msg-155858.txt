Greater Fey, 2 of them, one on the road from Felwithe to Kelethin close to
Kelethin, the other on the road from Felwithe to the spires, closer to the
middle distance between... one in Butcher Block near the road close to Kaladim,
one in Everfrost just off the path from Halas to Snowflake. Those are the ones I
have seen, I hear there is one in UP somewhere too, but haven't verified where
yet.
