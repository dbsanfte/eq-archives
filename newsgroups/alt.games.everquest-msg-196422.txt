I got a ton of mileage out of Lull line at FM fort with two different
Paladins, back when it sucked.  I don't think I ever got any real
value out of the spells anywhere else, but the giants at the FM fort
were/are apparaently positioned just right for a bit of agro reduction
to make a huge difference.  Once in a while I'd get agro from a resist,
but not often.  I used it solo, when an add meant either a long run to
zone or an even longer CR, and in groups that couldn't stand up to
multi-pulls on a routine basis.
