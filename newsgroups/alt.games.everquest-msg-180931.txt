What's worse, in my opinion, than people who park in handicap spaces
without a tag are perfectly healthy people who bring grandma in the
car with them so they can use grandma's handicap placecard, then leave
grandma in the car while they go shopping. If the handicap person
isn't getting out of the car, you don't need to park in the space.
Save it for someone who needs it.
