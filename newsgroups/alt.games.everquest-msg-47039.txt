Where do I suggest you pull even cons? I mentioned them not at all. There
are low blues in dungeons too and they tend to have fewer HP, not hit as
hard and give better exp than the equivalent outdoors mobs. Neither do you
need a balanced team of 6 - it is perfectly easy to take 2-5 people, in some
really odd configurations, and make decent exp indoors. PS anyone who won't
enter a dungeon without an enchanter is a chickenliver ;p

Everybody is crammed into Velketors Labyrinth these days. SolB can sometimes
be a little crowded. Guk Liveside has always been empty, Sebilis rarely has
more than 30 people, HS has never ever been crowded. All it takes is a
little time to learn the ropes and you can do very well in these areas. I've
rarely had a problem finding somewhere to set up in any of these dungeons
unless it's weekend peaktime and all the sunday campers are out.

There is more to "Experience" than the little yellow bar. If you get to 60
and know only how to run to nearby zonelines, what good are ya? :)

I don't mean to be too harsh on you Jak, you seem a decent guy, but one of
my main 'beefs' with EQ lately is the number of people levelling up too fast
in easy outdoor zones. I know it's scarey and daunting but really, try it.
Go indoors, try stuff out. Once you've cracked the learning curve of a few
dungeons you'll wonder why you ever wasted your time outside ;)
