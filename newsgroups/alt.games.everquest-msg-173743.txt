We killed him two days ago while on the way to the Herbalist, literally ON the
bridge, he aggroed in on us while we were taking down the bridgekeeper.

With two groups ranging from 54 to 62, he was no more than a mild nuisance,
I'd guess any decent group in the 50s could take him without breaking a sweat,
if they are capable of fighting down to his spawn area and then working it
till they get him to pop.
