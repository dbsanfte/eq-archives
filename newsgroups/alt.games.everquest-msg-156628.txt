Ive been playing EQ for a couple years now and I have 2 accounts with
a character of every class. I made a full circle back to the enchanter
which was my second character. At first, as I learned how the class
works I expected to be pretty much a group only buffer and mana regen
(i hate people calling it crack). I started playing her again and
found it damn near impossible to get a group in the mid teens. People
just didnt appreciate breeze, which I hoped would be thought of as a
necessity and with all the idiot melees in EQ mezz was a useless waste
of mana. I was lucky to get in a group and sponge enough xp to slowly
progress. Since this was how I started as an enchanter I ended up
going to other characters and leveling them up faster. I used hand me
down gear, or gear purchased with my druid or necro to twink her
pretty well. One thing of importance is a supply of sow potions. When
I finally got fed up and tried soloing I found it easier than I
expected. Now I just dinged 39 and I was 24 a couple weeks ago. I
spent the weekend running around in OT with illusion fire elemental or
air elemental to keep animal mobs from aggroing and when I got aggroed
by anything else I would either stun then root/nuke or just charm it
and sic it on another mob. I got so fond of charm kiting that I would
charm anything I saw and make it attack something. The xp just poured
in. Now I just run through places that my other classes would be
quivering in their boots to go through. Being able to mem blur, aoe
mezz, stun and the ability to be whatever race i need be (was born an
erudite) makes it pretty damn easy to get around. All this coupled
with sow makes for easy travelling. I found myself with almost an
arrogant feeling of security being able to go where I please and
control the minds of whatever. Confidence is a high.   :o)

All this because I cant get a group because everyone already has KEI
they just bought in bazaar. Monks, Clerics and Wizzies last
week.....you should expect the nerf bat to hit something that is
already de-stabilizing the game. Thanks C3....you just made me grow up
and work harder and use my head instead of being a group dependent
buffer pleading with the brain dead 8 year old whos tank is breaking
the mezz of the hard hitting mob who now is charging after me while
the cleric is busy chealing him or blabbing in guild chat.

Question is? How long will this last? I suspect not very long. I did
kill some drolvargs and giants in DL at 39 but it wasnt easy. I just
gotta level up so I can join my guild in some of the places they level
in. (most are 55+)
