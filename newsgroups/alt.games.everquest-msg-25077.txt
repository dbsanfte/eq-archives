We took about 4 group over to CoM, average around level 52 to kill reavers
and didn't have even one bit of trouble.  However, most of us had done it
before and knew not to get over-excited or nervous (I think most of us get
that way the first time they do a "difficult" critter) and lose our heads
(and lives).  Then we went upstairs via the air bridge (that was new to me)
to some room where we did some other spawn for someone else's epic.

Ok, so almost everyone leaves...we have to kill Rak-something for a shaman.
All that requires is a couple of mages (fire elementals, due to a relatively
nasty AE spell on Rak, and those elementals are immune) and 4 clerics (could
have gotten away with 2 as it turns out), so the vast majority of people
left.  We were left with 3 tank-types, 4 clerics, 2 mages, and 2 enchanters
and only the clerics had ANYTHING to do.  After all, one of the folks from
the uber guild who was helping said "oh, he doesn't gate."

Well, he gates.  Back to the room where the reavers spawn.  He summoned the
2 magicians where they quickly died, and a reaver came over to our camp to
party.

NOW the clerics had something to do.  So did the enchanters...the reaver
brought a couple of undead buddies and a fog golem.  The tanks now had
something to do, killing the reaver, and the mages were cowering in the
corner praying for buffs and rez effects to go away (one cleric had the
click stick).

<Flashback>

As you may know, as soon as a reaver dies, something takes its place.  It
can be another reaver, or a few different undead-types.  Each reaver MAY
drop a jade reaver.  You may also know that they're 100% MR.

Earlier in the raid we weren't very lucky.  We attacked 3 or 4 reavers, and
each only respawned one more reaver.</flashback>

Meanwhile back at the farm we weren't overly concerned about the
reaver...after all, we did a good job killing the double spawn.  THIS time,
of course, he didn't just respawn once...or twice...he respawned *SIX* times
(a total of 7) and the 8th spawn was Lord Ghiosk (easier than the reavers,
no biggie).   All this with *3* tanks and 4 clerics...AND I (playing a
cleric) HAD LOTS OF MANA AT THE END...at least 30%.

Thank god for C2 though. :)
