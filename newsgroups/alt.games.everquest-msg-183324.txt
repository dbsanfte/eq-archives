I've been able to obtain all the parts of the quest except the heart from SolA.
 As a level 39 wiz do I have a chance at getting this part solo?  Second
question, I've seen people that have spell icons set up on their hot keys, can
anyone explain to me how to do this?  Can you do it with an inventory slot so
you don't have to have your inventory open while right clicking the staff? 
Thanks in advance.
