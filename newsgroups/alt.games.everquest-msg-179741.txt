Where the fuck do you work?  McDonalds?  I work in a major
Telecommunications sector and we ALL Have gotten pay freezes up to
management level for well over a year.  In fact the last corporate meeting
was, you don't like it, leave.  Cause they know how the U.S. job market is
these days.  Less of course you are guaranteed that 10cents a raise every 2
months working at McDonalds like yourself..heh.
