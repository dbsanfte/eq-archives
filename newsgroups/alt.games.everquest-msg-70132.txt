 I don't see the argument here. Basically if you have both a Ranger and
a Druid in a group, the two work out who handles snaring. At least
that's how I've always done it. Same thing if you have a SK in your
group, actually. If someone gets low on mana or is having trouble
snaring, just ask the other person if they can get it to stick. I
haven't really seen mana being an issue, especially since Elder
Spiritists Gauntlets are like, almost free or something. No stats and
snare rather than ensare, but I still carry them around and use them for
snaring when grouped.
