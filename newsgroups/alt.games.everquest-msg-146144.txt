Yeah, they would implement this after my informative
post ;-).

Solid group taking out even con mobs = serious
downtime.  I don't mind if they're upping the xp
per higher level mobs...what I do mind would be
spending 4 hours to get xp back after that even
con mob kills 2 members of your party every time
you fight him :-).

Wasn't much risk in grinding, but that's what made
it grinding.  Raids were for risk/reward, grinding
just ment putting in the time to get the xp.
