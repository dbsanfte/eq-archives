This guy sounds like an idiot.  But just wanted to point out one thing.
 Sometimes a Ranger can get very, very annoyed with a tank who cannot
produce any hate.  It is the Ranger's job to keep hate low at the
beginning of the fight but the tank's job after that, the way I see it.
 If you have to keep jolting throughout, you are seriously reducing
your DPS.  Once again, this guy is probably an idiot, and a Ranger
should ALWAYS have jolt up.  Heck I keep it up when soloing.

I do run out of spells slots, actually.  I like to keep a heal, jolt, 2
nukes, harmo, tangling weeds, earthen embrace, and root up.  If mobs
are tashing, cure poison, if there is a necro, regen, if the tank is
whining for a DS, then my DS, if I am tanking or may need to grab agro,
flame lick, etc..  So even with 9 spell slots I can find myself wanting
10.  But let's just say that if I need to rebuff, I drop the nukes, not
jolt.
