I'm sorry if you feel I am overreacting, yours is one of the more reasonable
voices.  I did not say I was gone for good, just going to reduce my time
spent here filtering through the garbage.  And I made a suggestion for
getting rid of the problem.

In the 12 hours since my original post there have been 13 threads started,
only 6 have been EQ related, and 2 commercial spam.  Thats 5 full threads
(and they are the longest) of discussion about the newsgroup.  Some of it
positive; thank you Trueson and Magpie13, or threads that are just trash and
garbage.  But I am just getting tired of discussion ABOUT the newsgroup, and
very tired of garbage.  Trying to filter out what I want to read is being
massively complicated by the children,  and I hope people read and take my
suggestion to heart.

Thats all, and I do realize the good people are here still, and that it is
only a small few who are the disrupters, thats why it should be easy to get
rid of them (not by reporting, that just gives them a kick) but by ignoring
them.

Again thank you,
Martyn Ranger of 16 seasons, Povar.
Tunare Bless.
