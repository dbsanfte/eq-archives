On what planet of EQ are you talking about?  You can pick up herbalist
packs (which are 20% IIRC) for 100 to 200pp, Shralok Packs are around
250pp, I am getting a steal on a Light Burlap sack for 150.  My Evil
Eye which is 70% ran me 300pp.   Even if I bought all 4 of those it
wouldnt come anywhere NEAR the numbers you are talking.  Then again I
dont play on Rallos Zek where apparently Drizzt paid 22kp for a
Mithral Fier Dal Morning Star either according to the report he
managed to slide thru EQprices=)

I read the entire thing, I am beginning to wonder if YOU did though.
