The other one I like is when they want you to explain to them
how to get from one side of the frickin' world to the other.
Like someone in EC says "How do I get to Halas from here?"
Uh yeah right like anyone is going to bother explaining that to
you in the chat interface. That's like someone in New York asking
a person on the street "How do I get to Peking from here?"
