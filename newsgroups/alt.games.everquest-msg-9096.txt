Get real.  He was screwing the women and  kids and claiming to be Jesus.  If
that don't make you a lunatic then I don't know what will.   Obviously, he
wasn't Jesus.   The world is a better place without him.  How can people we
so weak minded to follow this guy?  Some people will do anything to belong
to something.   Of course, it could have been handled better and in a less
barbaric fashion but some hunch tells me that David wasn't going to let
David be taken alive.  The FBI hasn't did so hot in the last ten years it is
obvious that perhaps an overhaul needs considered.  While under Louis the
bureau has strengthened International ties and abilities but it has dropped
the ball on a number of events on US soil.

As for the right to bear arms it should only apply to sane people which
leaves Khoresh out of the pictures. You have delusions you don't need a gun
plain and simple.  I am a veteran and we don't need a militia of rednecks,
paranoids and religious nutcases.  The concept of a militia is very dated.
I am for responsible gun ownership but anybody who thinks that these guys
being responsible wrong.   They were using the women and children as
collateral and hostages anyone who supports that behavior  likely shares the
values of these cowards.  Responsible and brave people would have let the
non-combatants out.  People are always looking for a martyr for their
causes.  Likewise why didn't they let the lady out at Ruby Ridge.  She would
have never got shot if they had acted like men in the past would have done
so.  But the mind of a terrorist or extremist is off to begin with so why am
I even asking?  Sometimes I think our government has too control over daily
manners  and don't agree with all it's policies but I still believe it is
the best government in the world.

McViegh wants to be a martyr.  He envisions himself as a patriot.  Even if
he did think that the government targeted innocents he didn't get back at
the people that did it.  He bombed innocents. He is pretty whacked too.  He
will go down a domestic terrorist and be right up there with Benedict Arnold
in status.  The winners write the history books and he will be rightly
labeled as a extremist who went too far.   Terrorism is war for those who
won't face the enemy.  McViegh took out his anger on innocents not the US
government.  I wish that I wasn't agnostic because Hell would be merited in
his case.
I can't believe people are endorsing this pedophile Khoresh or twisted
terrorist McViegh.  It is their right but it shows we are really losing the
battle for our society's decadence or integrity. Instead, of waiting or
instigating a revolution why don't people try to make a difference today?
