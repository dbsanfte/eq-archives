The server wide war thing was being tried for the opening with The GFay and
FV scenerio but the SNERTS AND PITA's screwed the pooch on it.  I think if
the powers that be really wanted to continue the campagin they could have
set up safe walls, such as if the Pita attacks main character in RP they
could be transported to a place of pain/death or a little room with no way
out, or just flag them so all the people who want to play the event can kill
them.

I am bummed the event got cancelled, My guildmates and I were ready to
defend.
