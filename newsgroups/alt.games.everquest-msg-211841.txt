Do they have their epic? That's an additional 40% haste

Different mobs with different level of AC which effects how often you hit.
Parse on those same mobs with your Monk and you'll find your doing far
higher dps than your warrior.

One item difference can make all the world in DPS and that in a word is
haste. Also when parsing are they counting spell haste? That will make a
whole lot of dps not to mention buffs that increase ATK or str which
increases your average damage.

Everyone's DPS gets "turned on" after the correct sequence. The jump in
power from 59th to 60th is unreal and it gets sick after 60th. My Ranger
even when it came to melee was doing far more damage and was able to tank
immensly better post 60th. For one your haste cap changes so suddenly your
moved from like 85% haste to 100% and that makes a very tangible difference.
Not to mention the better damage tables as you progress in levels.
It has too because the mob power scales up as well.
