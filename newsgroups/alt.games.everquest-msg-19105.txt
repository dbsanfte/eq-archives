The "law" inside Everquest-land is that you can not transfer
characters or items for real-world money.  See the EULA,
which you have agreed to every time you play the game.  Their
world, their rules, they set the "law" for Norrath.  If you don't
like those rules, don't play the game.  But don't agree to the
EULA, play the game, then try to weasel your way out of the
"no transfers for cash" rule by lamely trying to say that
what you're "really" selling when you accept cash for an
in-game item or character is your "time" (snicker, guffaw).

Sell your time all you want, but the moment you transfer an
item or character as part of the deal, you're selling an
item or character, no matter how much you try to split hairs
about your "time".
