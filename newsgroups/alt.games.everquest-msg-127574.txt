I did this not long ago, as a Druid, at lvl 19.

Read Allakhazam's about the quest, it gives
detailed info on how to avoid that red smuggler,
who is the only real obstacle.

Once he has gone down to the water, you have about
30 secs to drop Dyllin, which is plenty of time
with the lvl 19 spells.

Good luck
