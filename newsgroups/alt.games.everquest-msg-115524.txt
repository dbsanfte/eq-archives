If you have Luclin, i might suggest shadeweaver's thicket.  HQ rockhopper
hides drop pretty frequently there and sell for 10 - 20 pp each to tailors
for making backpacks.  With sense animals and some of the other nice druid
spells you shou;d be able to pick up 4 or 5 hides per hour.  And you can run
over to hollowshade moor and buy a nice starter suit of hopperhide armor for
less than 10 pp.
