Hmm, the article lacks a link to Castronova's new paper, which I'd be far 
more interested in reading.

I dunno, I see plenty of bigotry transported into the game already.  The 
term 'Inky' particularly gets up my craw.  And one more comment about 
using Gnomes as footballs... Grr! :)  I think really, MMORPGS just gives 
idiots one more venue to be idiots in.  People who pick up the message you 
mention probably would have figured it out in real life, too.  Just to 
make matters worse, in-game physical differences -do- matter.  A perfectly 
reasonable case can be made for, e.g., Ogres being superior tanks.

>Similarly for gender and sexuality.

...And don't get me started on the number of times I hear people in this 
game use the word 'gay' to mean something is bad or substandard... 
Spelling it 'ghey' really doesn't make it much better, in my eyes.  But at 
least SOE sanctions gay marriages, so they're ahead of the curve, there. 
:)

Naw, I'm with the other followup, there.  I think it's far more likely we 
have soldiers over there expecting to respawn or click on a life-giving 
medikit if they get wounded, or thinking they probably have enough 
hitpoints to be hit 6-7 times before they'll need a cleric.
