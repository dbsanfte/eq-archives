I admire you desire to help out the guild in a jam, that shows alot of
loyalty when the shit hits the fan. I wish there where more like you when
the going gets tough!

I understand your frustration, I'd be pissed too, but *you* took action that
was not security minded.

Each time you sign into EQ it tells you *not* to give your password to
anyone, just for situations like this.

I imagine SoE is showing no sympathy to your situation and is telling you
the same thing.


Good luck, I hope this doesn't take you away from a great game.
