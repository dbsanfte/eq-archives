I will happily sell crafted bracers and guantlets at the price of the gems
needed
for the quest.  Why?  Because the exp for the quests is substantial, about
three
blue, for comparatively little effort.  When I first did this, ages ago, I was
further
able to double my money selling the pieces at auction.

Nowadays, though, prices have steadily dropped on the stuff, as new crafted
is constantly injected into the market, along with higher level warriors
returning
their castoffs to the market... and you can also blame people like me, who
can't be bothered sitting around auctioning for a price that leaves any profit.

If I break even I can do the quest again, more or less free exp, like buying
will-o-wisp stones at 8pp each.

If I really cared, I could probably do the same with the rest of the crafted
pieces, but the gauntlets in particular are right there in the same zone, while

the bracers are the only piece you can carry more than one of, so you
can loot up a whole bag full of the optic nerves and gems and level up
quick, without shuttling around and trying to sell completed ones to clear
space for the next.
