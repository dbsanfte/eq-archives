Heh... and based on most of the stuff written about EQ1 it shouldn't 
appeal to very many people either.

Pointless character cration stats, worthless quests, mostly worthless 
tradeskills, liberal use of the nerf bat, endless factioning on 
creatures with no loot and no experience, endless camping of creatures 
with no loot and no experience, plat duping exploits, dismal customer 
service, 'the boats' (now gone), the 'spell book' (now gone), naked 
corpse recoveries, beyond stupid bug-fix kludges, monsters that run 
through walls, "zoning", xp loss (and naked corpse recovery) for getting 
squashed by a hill giant during zone in...

I enjoy EQ quite a bit... but its something one has to experience... if 
you just read about the various game mechanics I would immediately 
conclude its a piece of crap. But its not, its a good game on a more 
sublime level, despite being a lumbering hunk of junk mechanically.

Same with EQ2, if they deliver the same mix of challenge, and 
support/encouragement for social interaction it could be a winner, in 
spite of bad mechanics. Not saying it will happen... but writing it off 
because you don't like a few mechanics is silly... eq1 is full of 
brain-dead mechanics and we still like it 'just fine'.
