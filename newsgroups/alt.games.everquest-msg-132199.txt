Nope. Speaking is second nature to nearly all people. Typing is second
nature to some people, who don't need to think about what they are typing or
where to look. Their fingers are literally their mouthpiece. Perhaps to give
you an understanding :  do you think people who use sign language think
about everything they say before they sign it?

Shouting "SHIT!" can be done without any

Not necessarily. If the converstion is being held in /ooc  (never mind that
this can be set as a default/macro), it's not impossible to subconscioulsy
type that within the framework of the conversation. Much the same as if you
decide to verbally speak in a whisper or a shout.
