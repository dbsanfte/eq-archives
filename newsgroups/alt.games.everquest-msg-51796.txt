Yep. That will certainly get you to the mid 40's at least, if you follow
that same advice that you'll get from 3/4 of the players around.  Of
course, you'll be in for a rude surprise in your late 40's and 50's when
you find that you *have to* go fight in tough, complex dungeons, you
*must* have a group, and your groupmates find out that you couldn't find
your ass with both hands in a dungeon, having never spent any time in
one.
