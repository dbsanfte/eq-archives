> What solution do you (hughes, not Jerimah) propose for the bards then?

A settable flag that contains at the least the 3 following options.

1) the present manner of going ld and standing absolutely still and taking
no action for 30 seconds while tanking. (usefull for raid situations, of for
where death is actually a possibility and a corpse hunt is annoying i.e.
someplace like the new ct or umbral planes)

2) evade option run at top speed away from aggro mobs untill your 30 seconds
is up.

3) an option to charm aggro mobs at every available tick or lullaby them
would not be bad either.

For casters I would add a flag for gate. And perhaps a flag for root or mez
and move out of direct combat range.

oh and for for jeremiah there are nice easy solutions for each of his points
:) first the if elses are nestled you dont have to meet all of them just one
. Yes sow is a complete protection if all aggro mobs are slower, yes a
wizard vs a mob that he has snared is a complete protection. If your a necro
it is entirely reasonable to add both mana and health together and check vs
that.

What you are trying to check for is could a reasonable man in that
circumstance evade death. While soloing whether you like it or not a
reasonable man has pretty much no chance of dying unless he is experimenting
with something new. While on a raid or in a group deep in a dungeon this is
not true at all of course but irrelevant. In either of those circumstances
your friends can and will aid you and the annoyance of death is
significantly reduced anyway. Oh and btw your right , I was not
significantly harmed by the ld death . Fairly easy for me to boot up the
other comp, log in a venerable high priest and shake his stick at my corpse.
I then had to port to a ring to get rebuffed. However the average caster has
nowhere near my resources and would have been harmed so I am still annoyed.
The ld cost me about 20 minutes of playing time.
