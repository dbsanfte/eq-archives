Thanks again, Lance, for being the almost solo voice I hear telling
me it just might be okay the way I'm gearing up my 36 Cleric and my
29 Shammy.  They get about 155+ Wis and I'm happy for now.

Cleric gets:  Max AC, Focus Gear, HPs gear in that order. (Wis if all else
about equal)

Shammy gets:  Focus Gear first, then Max AC in order of priority. (HPs and
Wis later)

Between both chars combined I've had KEI twice, and neither time by my
request.
I really think mana management got dumped/buried when KEI hit the game and
some
people are just now realizing that.

My Shammy Dots and Kites (like a baby Druid?) <lol>  and Regen + Cannabalize
keeeps me in mana just fine with my focus items.  I'm in heaven when I get a
Breeze
or Clarity cast on me.  Hard to actually use the mana fast enough then
unless I'm in
a big group doing constant, fast pulls.
