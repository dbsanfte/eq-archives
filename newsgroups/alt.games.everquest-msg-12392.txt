Slightly off topic, but I found a firepot in Neriak 3rd quarter years ago
that tells me "it's locked and you dont have the key".  Just checked and
it's still there, but I've never heard any mention of it anywhere.  Anyone
know if it's functional or anything?  loc is p903, n1808, the most eastern
spot in 3rd quarter.
