You have no idea how sick I am of hearing brain-dead simpletons give
the "If you want to solo play a single-player game" bullshit.

You do realize "MMORPG" does not and should not mean "Have to group
all the time"? You realize that playing with others doesn't only mean
grouping with them? You realize that no single-player game gives the
same experience as an MMORPG, even to a soloer?

Many people don't play for the aspect of teaming with others. They
play for guilds, player economy, and general social interaction within
a persistent game world. They also like having the -option- of teaming
when they want to, not being -forced- to team just to make any
progress in advancing their character. *coughFFXIcough*
