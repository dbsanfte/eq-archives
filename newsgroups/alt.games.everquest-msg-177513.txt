Our guild did this part of the Shaman epic fairly recently, and we were down
to three groups by the time we hit the bottom of the Hole. Trying to get
everybody inside wound up wiping one of the remaining groups, and the
force that took the epic MOB wound up being about one and a half groups.
They had to get out in a hurry after that however.

Personally I had some theories on getting people into the final area
(involving use of Pacify, Invis to Undead and Improved IVU) that were never
used, but that part of the Shaman epic should not be too difficult.
