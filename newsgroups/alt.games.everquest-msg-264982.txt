Amazing, but true. The thing that's most amazing about it is how they 
completely different they used to be. At one time they had an unrivaled 
reputation for quality games. Sam & Max was a classic, but so were the 
original XWing and TIE Fighter games. Few games have ever pulled me in and 
absorbed me as much as the original XWing. Full Throttle got some great 
reviews (by then I was pretty much out of the adventure genre, so never 
tried it). But they had a solid reputation. And then they started putting 
out crap. I don't know if George just got bored and gave up caring and it 
trickled down into the rest of the organization or what, but they've been on 
a decline ever since (movies, games, all properties).
