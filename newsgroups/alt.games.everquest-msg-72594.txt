Same can be said of any class.

Ever since VI pulled their heads outta their asses about the 100%
spell resistent flag on mobs that they didn't want slowable, necros
have been able to generate pretty decent amount of damages.

And don't discount mana dumping.  It's very important at raids.  And
don't give me crap about how it's such a limited role blah blah blah.
All classes at the end game encounters have very specialized and
limited roles.
