Which is the speed of a L9 SoW IIRC

To justify that cost, and to differentiate between the 3 horse speeds, I
assume the difference will be noticeable. Otherwise, who would pay out
for horses rather than instacast jboots or 5k tboots?

>Probably a little slower than the fastest

No info has been released that I know of.
3 different speeds of horse, with price tags to reflect their speed. I
would expect the lowest horse to be around max SoW, middle horse
slightly faster, and top-end horse rivalling Selo's

3% of the population?

Most decent L50+ items are around the 10k or more mark, or at least were
there for a long while. There is a much larger market than 3% of the
total population for 10k all/all items. The items that started high and
reduced in price is more to do with a flooded market, rather than a poor
market
