There is a shortcut, I beleive its well documented on allahs. Where you 
hop up at the church by jumping on a flag, go through the building, up 
the clear bridge, and then around the first tower on the ledge to the 
bridge to the 2nd. Then hop up to the top of the door frame at the 2nd 
(which is locked and which has no ledge like the first one), and you can 
levitate to the bridge to the 3rd, where the wraith spawns.

I've done the Wraith twice like this. Its not as hard as it might sound.
