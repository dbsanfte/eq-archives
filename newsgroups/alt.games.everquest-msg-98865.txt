Thanks for the relevent response. Oh, and the top posting.

The United Ale Drinkers is reletively young guild with a small (but
growing) membership. We do have scheduled events every one to two
weeks, but our membership is still too small to count on many members
being on at once during any given time. Add to that the fact that I
work odd hours during the week and guild members are not likely to be
on when I am. This gives me one, sometimes two days a week I can group
with guildies. I am looking for PU and Solo opportunities to fill up
the rest of the time.
