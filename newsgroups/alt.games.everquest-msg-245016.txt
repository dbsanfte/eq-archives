-Charm animals in PoNightmare or PoD.  Pet tank, pally heal and buff. 
Pally mostly sits on ass and Druid gets the exp for the group.

-Fearkite stalkers or crows in PoN, rats in PoD.

-If you can get someone behind the pally, aggro kite in PoD or PoN. 
Cant do this in PoJ til level 58, when sralm noramir stops adding. 
But at 58, you can actually take on the high guardians of justice
(level 61) with aggro kiting.  Only problem is that it can cause
problems for the lower levels pulling to the exits.  You have to kite
them around the entrance halls.  A level 51 pulls something though the
HG and aggros it.  Now when the HG passes anything else, while you are
high enough that there is no social aggro, it will aggro the rat or
prisoner on the lowby.

-I dont know much about it but Druids seem to love PoStorms.  You wont
be able to charm like I think they do.  However you may be able to,
once again, aggro kite.  You will have to learn the zone better than
me though.  I think that certain frogs summon and certain others do
not.  Keep an eye open for Diaku raiders if you do this.  They dont
summon and drop medallions used for an alternate key quest for
PoTactics.

-Possibly the Hole?  There are ratmen inside, if you were insane
enough to charm in there.  But there are also undead that hit for
around 100-150?  They are around level 48 or 50?  Anyway, pally would
be good DPS on them.

These are the best experience zones I could come up with...maybe not
the funnest or best loot though.
