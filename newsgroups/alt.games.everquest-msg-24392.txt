Yes. As I said to a friend while groping blindly "So let me get this 
straight - I can get off a cast while three large red things are handing 
me my butt, but the at the TINIEST little rock of a boat, I'm suddenly 
helpless????"  Annoying, isn't it?  I'm not sure WHY you can't cast on a 
boat.  Anyone know?  Especially a spell that's been a trivial thing for, 
oh, levels now.  Antonican boat I can see.  It's smaller and would 
probably rock quite a bit on the open water.  But the Maiden's Voyage is 
a HUGE ship, so big that even in a storm it would probably be fairly 
stable.

Besides, IRL I LOVE a storm ;p

Annnnyway.  Yes.  I usually sight the gigantic statue, jump off the boat, 
cast sow and lev, and run for the docks.
