People often come here and post "EQ sucks" and "I quit" messages.

Since this is a server full of people who generally don't think
EQ sucks enough to quit, and since we've heard the "I quit"
messages a thousand times before, rapidly we started to say "can
I have your stuff".  Then it became a competition to see who
could make the "Can I Have Your Stuff" post first.  To save
bandwidth and typing time, this became CIHYS

Since there are a lot of servers out there, its unlikely that any
of us can actually get the "stuff" and the people threatening to
quit rarely have any "stuff" worth having anyway.

But its a nice putdown anyway.
