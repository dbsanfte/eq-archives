<evil giggle> I have kiss my butt ally skyshrine faction, and as 
a 56 cleric I sit at the top of the ramp into the tower to med to 
full, stand, root, nuke, nuke, nuke, root tiny nuke and it drops. 
Walk over and loot up. Target the next one, lather rinse repeat 
and med when required.  When you have killer faction, as long as 
you are out of normal agro range for its buddies you can root and 
nuke your little heart out and will only have agro from the one 
you are engaged with. I will clear the tower and sit under 
Yvolcarn to med and the druids just sort of boggle and keep 
asking my secret=)

It is fun to then go and sell off and bank in skyshrine. As long 
as you dont kill the named and take faction hits, you can do this 
with any of the wyverns. Of course I dont kill othmirs, and only 
enough sirens to get the hair for my shawl quest=)
