so what's this i hear about lvl 30 and above suckin' ?

i've been playing for just over 6 months now and i've loved every minute of
it...  i only have two main chr's, a lvl 29 rogue and a lvl 19 druid...

my friends all have chr's in the 40's and 50's and now they're tellin me
they're goin' to quit cause it's too difficult to get their alt chr's to the
higher levels and with all the recent program changes, group exp etc,
they've decided they've had enough...

what gives ?

maybe EQ should support levels up to 100 and maybe...   ..have more servers
to get a lower population per server ratio so we all don't have to fight
over quests etc...

ideas ? should i swith to Ultima Online or other
????????????????????????????
