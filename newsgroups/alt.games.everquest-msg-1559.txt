All,

I am a level 16 wizard, and I am new to research. I have placed my one
point into Research (the limit until I hit 20 because of the formula). I
want to research one (for now) of my level 16 spells, Pillar of Fire.

This requires the Lexicon, the Rune of Periphery, and the Rune of
Nagafen. Fair enough.

However, where do the runes come from? I know they drop from creatures
from levels 16 to 21 (according to Mythrian's Tower, it drops on mobs
from the spell's level to 5 over that). However, I have heard a rumor
that certain mobs drop certain runes. If so, which drop the runes I
need?

I.E. When Mythrian's mentions that certain mobs drop certain runes, was
that just a reference to the level requirements, or is it more specific?
Does it get to the point that a specific KIND of creature drops the rune
I need?

Or do I just keep killing level 16-21 mobs until the runes are dropped?

Thanks,

Lewis
