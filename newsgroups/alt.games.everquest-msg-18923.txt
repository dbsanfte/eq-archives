You dont need to be a member to submit prices or look them up so that
really doesnt matter.

The biggest key to look at IMHO isnt simply the price, but more
imporantly the number of reports.  Items with high numbers of reports
are going to be more accurate than those with lower.  To give an idea
of how this affects reality, take a look at the example you  cited and
what you fell the relationship was between reality prices and listed:

Axe of the Ironback   Price: 60  Reports:  121  

Brass Goblin Flamberge   Price: 150  Reports:  26

Drakkel Forged Bastard Sword   Price: 310  Reports: 37

And to toss in a couple of my own:

Executioners Axe  Price:590   Reports: 158 (Close - 500 to 600 MT)

Short Sword of the YKesha  Price: 1400  Reports: 308

Wurmslayer   Price: 4200  Reports: 300

Loam Encrusted Choker   Price: 2100   Reports: 6

As you can see, those with larger numbers of reports tend to be
considerably more accurate.  These prices are even based on a list
that is a couple months old.
