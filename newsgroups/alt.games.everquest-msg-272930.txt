A law is reported to have been broken in each case, even if it is false,
as in the examples you "cite".

Suffice it to say that I don't believe you.

That you think there were no police reports filed citing the violation
of some law or ordinance shows yours.

I don't care if he sent them flowers and chocolates as he voiced his
concerns in a cordial whisper of "goo's" and "gah's" topped off with a
heapin' helpin' of "please's" and "thank-you's". They have every right
to ban him from their site. In other words, they are not in the wrong.
Therefore, they certainly deserve no jail time as you claimed. Contempt,
maybe, but certainly nothing worse than that. 

This is all beside the point that I have little doubt the person was
showing his a**. I've seen it a hundred times, and none of them ever
think they deserve it.
