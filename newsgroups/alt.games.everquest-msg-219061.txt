Even the smallest guild needs at least one Warrior Tank.  The guild I
retired from had 5 warriors who were 60+.  Our guild had a little over 40
active players with a total of over 150 toons.  Our members who had warriors
usually kept them shelved until we needed them.  A good strategy may be for
the ones in your baby guild that like the melee classes to start two toons.
Make a Warrior and then an alt. of another plate class.  Then just take the
time to level both of them equally.  Try not to let either one of them get
too far ahead of the other.  Doing this can really slow down your level
advancement however since the two will be close to one another in level you
will be leveling both in the same zones at the same time.  I had a friend
who leveled a Bard and Shadow Knight like this without too many problems.
Also, once you hit your 50s and begin to fight exp mobs where a Paladin or
Shadow Knight as a MT is preferred over a Warrior, you will not be out of
luck since all you have is a Warrior.

Of course there still is the issue of SOE promising to do something that
will help a Warrior's Taunt ability.  All of these things can change if
Warriors are changed to allow them to have a better Taunt so that they can
get and hold agro as easily as a casting Shadow Knight or Paladin.
