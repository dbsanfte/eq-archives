i'm seriously thinking about playing an mmorpg and i really have  problmes
to decide which o should choose. i am in the Dark age of camelot beta test,
but they don't have the possibilty to pay those game cards instead of
providing your credit card number. that feature is very attractive to me and
so i tjink of starting EQ even if it's nearly 2 years old..any advices?
thanks

fabian
