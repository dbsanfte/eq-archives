Short answer:  no.

Long answer:  Velious has 'dragging' aggro where mobs will
aggro on anyone who's dragging a corpse, period.   A person
with max ally who does something stupid and dies can't even
drag their own corpse, for instance.    Obviously feign dragging
and dragging while invis'd work.

And, IIRC, those rules apply (at least) to parts of ToV, Kael, and
Skyshrine.   I don't believe it applies to either Thurgadin or
Icewell Keep or any of the 'outdoor' zones.
