To answer something you said later in this thread (your actual question has
already been answered)....

EQ is a PvE game.  Player Versus Environment, not each other.  If you're
looking to frag your buddies, play a different game.  While EQ does support
SOME PvP (Player Versus Player) it does it only half-assedly.

If you want to go WITH your friends to nuke and beat the crap out of a
goblin, then this IS the game for you. :)
