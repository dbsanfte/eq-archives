    You're a loot officer, you may be familiar with this. Person X would be
upgraded by an item, but refuses to send tells on it because they think they
don't deserve it or it isn't their "dream item". So person X won't ask for
the item, but will roll if everyone is given a chance to get the item for
free. That mace is made for all the person X's in the guild. And that's why
we pull it, to upgrade the people that wouldn't otherwise ask for it to be
pulled to upgrade themselves.
