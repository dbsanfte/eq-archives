Yes you just have to be carefull . Jboots are a really nice junk buff to
keep in slot 1 . Try to keep their dot in an upper slot as well since they
frequently dispell there own dot.

With run 3 you outrun them anyway so there is no great danger if they do not
snare you :)

If you are carefull and have an extended range item as well as a cast faster
item you can snare them and kill them at range with regular nukes outside of
their casting range. If you use bolt spells or druid dots (anything with a
base 300 instead of 200 range ) this becomes trivial.
