And why not?
Right now, what's to discuss? OH! I know :D
How many weeks do you predict EQ will be unplayable after tonights
patch?

How many Iksar who worked up East/West Freeport faction are gonna be
seriously boned by the revamp of Freeport? Or do you think we'll be
suprised and have a well thought out redesign?

I was going to do some serious EQ marathon playing this weekend before
PoR was released and broke everything for who knows how long; got a
baby sitter, had friends over to share the broadband, it was gonna be
great. I even caved in and bought Titanium (after I swore to myself OoW
would be my last expansion). Then my computer caught fire from a
defective (brand-spanking-new) hard drive Saturday morning. And by fire
I mean orange glowy plasma and smoke. Then my monitor lost it's magic
blue smoke and learned how to sing (a transformer went bad; no picture,
just a loud squeeling sound). Fun times!

I spent the weekend trying to recover from that instead.

Xiphos - I'm going to tread very lightly, shrouded, throught the new
Freeport.
