Often terms we use are not technically correct and will change depending on
the level of the caller. A wall phone in Australia is stuck on the wall, and
can't be easily moved next to the computer whereas a "regular handset"
(regular phone) is exactly the same physical phone model but not attached to
anything - sitting on a desk or what have you but easily moved around.

I found through long experience that being technically correct and saying
"is your phone mounted on the wall or not" has next to no chance in getting
an intelligent answer. Saying "Is your phone a wall phone or is it a regular
phone" has a bit better chance but not much as people used to wall phones
think it is a regular phone and the question sounds to them "is it yellow or
yellow".

Relatively intelligent people who know exactly that a handset is actually a
part of the phone (or CB or what have you) and not the phone itself are
relatively few and far between BTW and it is easy to identify them within
seconds. I really think that a lot of people just do not know just how
stupid their fellow man is.

It is quite common to have people unaware they need to be connected to the
internet to send and recieve email and I have had quite a few complain "that
they never had to on their last ISP"...
