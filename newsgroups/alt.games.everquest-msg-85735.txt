    I agree and until someone parsers their logs and crunches the data I
will go with the strategy guide. Considering that it is written in
conjunction, or at least approval of, Verant I will go with what it says.

    Now, do I ever use the spells? I did for a couple days when they came
out. Noticed little if any improvement on myself and other group members.
They both reside on the last couple pages of useless spells now..
