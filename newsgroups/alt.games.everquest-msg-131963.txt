OK now i think your either one of those DIe Hard EQer's or just
stupid.
You can Easily compare a 03' honda to a Classic Vette. YOu must be
insane, there is no comparasion.Ones a plastic pile of imported crap
and the other is a Classic piece of engineering and design. Just show
me a honda with the same lines as a 63' vette. Quite Easily ...quite

Ahh but you did play FF 10 then right, you just didn't like it. Or Am
Ito believe you are speaking for the entire FF fanbase. Because if you
haven't played it you have nothing to base the assumption that you
won't like it.

EQ2 will not fail , I hate to tell you this. Many people are looking
forward to something "NEW" in the EQ world and EQ2 is it. Don't
believe me, just to a /OOC in game and ask " how many of you are going
to play EQ2?"  You'll more than likely get a few "i'm going to try it
out and see" and a few " I can't wait!!" And the problem with those
that are "only going to try it out" LOL I know a few heads that were
only going to try out EQ when it came out , me being one of them and
we are still playing. But the hack and slash is getting very old. And
as far as EQOA goes, bah, just another way of them getting money and
they will, remember, EQ is a international game and SONY is fronting
alot of cash, and don't forget that the FF online game that is out in
Japan at the moment "IS" the #1 game in Japan followed by "Kingdom of
Hearts" which is a joint Disney venture.Hell, if that PS2 FF game was
available here , i'd play it. Great graphics, great story, you still
have guilds and it's still a great commuinty that growing. yeah  I
know , graphics aren't a game but when you can get a whole system lke
a PS2 for the same or less than a 'GOOD"video card, why not. The
graphics for EQOA are better than EQ now with the Luclin Expansion.

 And yes those Numbers do affect us here in the USA. By the way I do
work for SONY , so I know the numbers are declining on EQ, but you'll
(the public) will never see them. And Sony would never go back to
something they cancel. More than likley they will close down EQ
(whenever that may be) and fire a shitload of people, it's happened in
the past, and it'll happen in the future. That just the way Sony is.
Just ask anybody that ever worked for Sony, and they'll tell you, the
job is only good for the discounts you get on Sony gear.

But hey enjoy the game while it's here like I do. But it will end, it
has to. And yes it will go down in the PC Hall of Fame as the inovator
of all online gaming worlds. So enjoy. Time will tell all....
