You're not too far off.  Roughly speaking, "hell" levels
(30, 35, 40, 45, 51+) require about twice as much experience
to complete as "non-hell" levels (except for 59, which is
considerably worse than any other).

Also, every level 54 and up has an additional "kicker" of about
1.5.

They may *feel* like they're 10 times worse, but they're not.
But they only feel that way if you obsess over them.  Every hell
level, I've made a point of *not* struggling for exp, and just
taking a break to sight-see and quest and so on.  As a result,
I've enjoyed my hell levels instead of suffering through them,
and in fact I've actually gotten through them faster than I
expected to.
