Break in?  On hate? : P

What exactly do you have to break into, ya just port up and run to camp.   If
you get aggroed, get down to the floor before dying and consent the rogues to
get you to camp.  Hate isn't like Fear, where there are wanderers that you
have to kill before the main group can enter.

Well, good luck anyways ; )

Bubbbye boys, have fun stormin' Hate!
