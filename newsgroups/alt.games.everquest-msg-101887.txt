*THAT* could explain it! My troll used to always get cammo every time I
got ported to WC (as I do for all other druid ring ports where NPC's
hang out, such as NK and halflingland.) Until one time we ported there
fast for a bank run, and I realized I had no cammo and was not being
attacked! I checked the druids and I had great faction with them. I bet
that's what they are on, because I spent many levels with my troll in
highpass and highkeep. I'm an ally up there as I recall.
