As well as STA for 50 stam
As well as Vigor for 225hp

620hp and 95 stamina, plus 105 dex if you add in Dexterity

It comes down to 5 slots vrs 2.  Your forgetting that you can have Stamina
with IOS & Kragg as well as SV which does give more HP then Fo7 & Boar.
Also you can add in DEX to the BST setup to bring it closer to max as well
then you could with Fo7.  Most Melees prefer to have max dex and more HP
over less buff slots, I do anyway, but my weapons have nice procs so I'm
biased.  Of course if we're just looking for best 2 slot combo you're right,
but again I prefer more slots and better overall stats to that personally.
I hate it when pickup Shammies (guildies and friends have learned not to)
blindly cast Focus on me, thinking it's the best buff for stats.  They even
get mad when I ask them not to do it again.  Our 65 guildie shammys have
added to their mgb focus hotkey the following line "Kaynin run for the hills
Focus inc!"

> Personally, I love having a BL along, extra mana regen, very nice DPS.

Yay!
