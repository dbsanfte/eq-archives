Yep, but there's a mixup of two things: Polygon count (i.e. refined models with
more edges and junctions) and memory. Lot of models and new high quality
textures will use up more memory. So, right, if you didn't have the memory,
disabling them would spee dup your game. But 512 MB is enough. You might
still see a big speedup if you disable the new models, because your graphics
card could not handle the load of polygons the new models have. For me,
I can load all new models without too much speed impact if I go from high
quality to medium quality textures. Had a *huge* impact on speed in some
zones. I still egt slowed down on big raids (50+ people) because there's
simply too much to calculate for my card :)
