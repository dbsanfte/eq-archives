   Thanks Lance.  But I have posted proof, best that I can.  I don't
make any claims that it makes any sense, mind you.

    I have seen one or two augmented things being sold.  If you join
/market and check the links religiously, you will also.  But you are
right, the number is definitely small.  I think this will increase the
longer LDoN is out, of course.  

   I seem to remember when Sony was hawking LDoN, some literature where
they claim that the augmented items will be sellable... let me see if I
can find it.... well, looking on google and on the official web site
crapped out.  Maybe I hallucinated it.  But I think we can all agree, FV
is weird.
