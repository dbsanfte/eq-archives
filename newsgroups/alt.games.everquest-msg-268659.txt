You can change most settings in-game to adjust between looks and speed, and
there is a handy drop-down list with a range of presets, ranging from best
appearance to best performance.  With a 2.4 GHz P4 and GeForce FX 5900XT
with 128 MB of video RAM, on the middle setting most places are OK, but in
some city zones it gets slow, so I just bring up the video options, and drop
it down to one of the more performance-oriented settings.

Give your system details, and someone will probably jump in with a similar
system and tell you what it is like.

It is kind of weird.  When playing a Priest class in other games, one of the
enjoyable aspects of that is the drive-by save--finding someone who is going
to lose, and has gone to far to be able to run away, so they are bravely
fighting on, to their seemingly inevitable doom, and then, out of nowhere,
they are healed!  Victory is snatched from the jaws of defeat!  Yadda yadda
yadda.

WoW is interesting in this respect: if you engage a mob, only you (or your
group) will get the XP for killing it, or loot, but others can still attack
it, or buff you.  So, they can't kill steal you, but they can help.

The thing that really stands out about EQ2 at the lower levels is the HUGE
number of quests.  At least up to the low teens, you'll typically have 20 to
40 pending quests, most doable solo, and many involving interesting story.

So, even if EQ2 turns out to *require* grouping at high level, if you just
play it through the low levels twice, thinking of it as a single player game
that happens to have other people running around in it--it will be worth it.
