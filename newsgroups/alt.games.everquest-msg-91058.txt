Who has a home network system setup, that has two (or more) computers
connected, that both play EQ at the same time and who also goes through
Comcast.  And works without constant disconnects?  What if it's a Linksys
what are your settings?  Having a dickens (and not Charles) of a time
playing EQ through my Linksys router.  EQ tech says I need to open all ports
>=1028 (I assume that's greater than or equal to 1028) which according to
the Linksys tech is impossible as there are over 60,000 possible ports.
Helpful hints?
