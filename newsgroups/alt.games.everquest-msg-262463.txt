What an ignorant thing to say.  Kerry is interested in building
alliances for the benefit of America, which sometimes means working
within the context of the UN.  He wouldn't, however, ever allow the UN
to walk all over the U.S.  That's just some stupid scare tactics
thought up by the republican propaganda machine.

You've been listening to Rush Limbaugh too much.  Let me give you a
hint: Only stupid, ignorant, unintelligent people listen to Rush
Limbaugh, much less believe anything he says.

Consider that a free clue.  You're welcome.

You've swallowed that simpleton republican propaganda hook, line, and
sinker, haven't you?
