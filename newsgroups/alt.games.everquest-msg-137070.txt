Sorry to have to tell you this Dan, but I'm not a tank. I'm a rogue. I 
wasn't the MT. And I certainly don't disagree with you that it was a 
bonehead thing to do to pull the nest. I also don't think the puller 
INTENDED to pull the nest. I CERTAINLY DO think the enchanter was wrong 
to piss and moan about it and be so rigid as to NOT change his tactics. 
You think I'm wrong so be it. I was there.
