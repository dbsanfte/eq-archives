Harm Touch is the SK only ability, I'm guessing you mean the Lich
(convert HPs to mana) line.  Dark Pact is the first of these I think,
Allure of Death is from memory exactly twice as efficient and it just
gets better and better from then on.  Call of Bones turns you into a
Skeleton as a bonus, which is fun.

HP all the way then mana then Int I guess.  Once you hit level 20 and
get Allure of Death you'll start to see why +HP items are good.  Any
items with good HPs will tend to have other good stats as well so that
kind of takes care of itself.

Don't forget Kurns Tower, huge dungeon ZEM and wussy mobs.

Oops.  I actually meant collecting stuff and handing in for nice xp at
newbie levels, my Shaman got some substantial xp early on handing
various bits and bobs into NPCs in Cabalis.

Anyone with 1000pp can walk into Bazaar and buy vastly superior
equipment for most slots than you can seriously be expected to quest
for unfortunately.

Having said that my Necro is 50-something in mostly trash gear that
she has had since the 30s than no self respecting proper Int caster
would be seen dead in and it doesn't seem to have affected her ability
to solo much other than her distinctly pitiful amount of HPs.
