both in the 3rd yellow of 56 at the time

Both, you will note, got the same exp in the same time
with AA off... which should eliminate race/class from
the equation.

Well, thats the way I've done it, and plan to do it in the future.  However,
I figured it would be more painless to dedicate 10% to AA; I'd hardly
feel the slowdown on "real" exp, and theoretically AA should still
accumulate pretty fast, isn't a blue in 56 about the same as a yellow in
50?  So I'd eventually get AA dings without ever having really tried
for them, and level just a bit slower.  Pure logic would suggest that
the same effect would result from once every ten days turning pure AA on...
but "its a fool that looks for logic in the chambers of the (coldain) heart"
