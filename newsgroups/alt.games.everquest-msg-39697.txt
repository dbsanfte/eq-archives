    Have you picked up YOUR Primal 2HB yet? ;-) On my server, the druids,
shamans, enchanters, necros, and mages in the top guild have started
spending their DKPs on Primal 2HBs so that they can try and get the killshot
on weak mobs like Dain. One SHM already got it on Dain, but he's facing
stiff competition now from the druid that also picked up some Gray Suede
Boots.

    Guess on your role: Ro's, followed by either a trip to bind point or (if
you live) healing off tanks?
