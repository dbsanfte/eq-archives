The "normal" group tends to be a tank (you) a healer and some other casters
or tanks.  But at early levels you'll be surprised what kind of groups you
can get into.  I remember in my early days with my Iksar Monk, a group of 5
Monks and a Shaman going into Kurn's and tearing through the place like
butter.  Was a beautiful crunchy thing.  :)

So just experiment and have fun.  Besides, you're not level 10 yet, what's
the worst that could happen?  You die?  LOL
