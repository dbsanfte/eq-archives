Weoll, let's see, EBayed accounts are banned when they're found out
anyway. It's apparently well known that most "stolen" accounts were
ebayed ones that the seller is scamming the buyer by claiming "stolen"
to VI. So, since they can't prove it was stolen and not ebayed, it's
banned.

Chances are a legitly stolen account will be stripped and whatnot when
it's finally gotten back, anyway.
