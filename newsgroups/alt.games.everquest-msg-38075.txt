In no particular order.

Terminator, (A classic, Arnie was awesome as a badguy)
The Black Mask (Jet Li film, cheesy as hell but some awesome fight scenes)
Fight Club, (Very good film, prolly my fave in the past few years, very well
acted and very tense in some parts)
Robocop, (The bit where the truck plows into the acid vat and the guy melts
is hilarious - I'm a sick sick man ;P)
Die Hard, (Why me? what has this gotta do with me?)
Total Recall, (Fave Scene: The guy getting his arms torn off on the
elevator)
The Matrix, (Shit ending but good special effects and a moderately
entertaining storyline)
Face/Off, (Good idea for a film, could have been better but not by much)
Gone in 60 Seconds, (another good idea for a movie, could have been better
tho - No gunplay!)
American History X (another awesome Edward Norton movie, he's a really
powerful actor ain't he? hehe)

You are wrong, fucked and overrated, I think I'm gonna be sick and it's your
fault,
This is the end of EVERYTHING,
You are the end of EVERYTHING.
I haven't slept since I woke up and found my whole life was a lie,
motherfucker,
This is the end of EVERYTHING,
You are the end of EVERYTHING.
