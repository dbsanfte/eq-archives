LOL.  Well, I THINK I did it last night for EQ 'cause I was thinking of this
thread.  In my version of ZAP (which I believe is mostly just a registered
version of ZA) I went to everquest.exe and hit the Options button, clicked
on the lower left "Always" radio button, and put check marks in the two
boxes below that...pretty much giving Verant permission to do whatever they
pleased, no matter what.

'Course, I won't know if that's the correct thing unless I happen to look at
my DAOC settings tonight to compare them...I'm never asked for DAOC anymore
and there've been lots of patches since I made the change.
