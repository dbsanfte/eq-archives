If I was not used to the big, hulking, fat trolls like I am, I would
probably think that new model looks awesome.  But for Everquest, that new
model is a total about face and totally unappropriate.  That grass looks too
realistic too, it is scary.  I definitely won't be upgrading unless you can
keep the entire original look of the game.
