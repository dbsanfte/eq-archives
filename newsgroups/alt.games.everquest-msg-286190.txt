     I have been out of EQ for a few years but read a few weeks ago that
the boats were back ?  I think I was, at the time, one of the very few
people in EQ who actually enjoyed the boats and the way they made me
feel that EQ was a world and not just a game. I was thinking of
resubscribing to EQ just to give them a looksy and was wondering if
anybody who has seen and ridden on the boats could tell me if they like
them and and how long it usually takes to travel on them ?  Also, how
often do they run ?   Is it dangerous to ride them in certain
areas...mob-wise, I mean ? (i.e. sharks and other critters) 

      Silly, I know.  But I really missed those boats :)
