You didn't mention your class.  For the sake of arguement, I'll
assume this means you are a cleric.  After all, I'm a cleric, so
you must be too.

Plan one.  Lull line.  We have a whole pile of these.  They reduce
aggro range on mobs.  So you walk up to casting range but outside
aggro range of the group, and cast lull on each mob except the
one nearest you.  Then you cast any spell other than lull on that
one, and he comes running, while the others are too far from him
to get excited, with their reduced range.  This is a thing of beauty
when it works.  Sadly, it rarely works.  Lull line spells are resisted
quite often, and unlike harmony, when resisted they aggro the
target.  Even on a pair, this means target and that "nearest" mob
and any other mobs you didn't stick lull to yet all come.

Plan two.  Root line.  Best on pulling a single from a pair.  Root
one mob, other comes running.  Either kill other fast enough that
root doesn't break before you are done, or run far enough away
that the rooted mob won't come to you when it does or get clever,
and root the mob that came or hand it off to a partner, go back
and atone the first mob.  Atone is the only spell in the lull line worth
having.

Plan three.  Pull with low aggro spell such as cancel magic.  If mobs
are far enough apart and you are high enough level, this sometimes
leaves the other mobs standing, where a nuke would get them all.

Plan four partner with a real puller, stop monkeying around trying to
do a job you aren't really suited for!
