There's more to chess than sheer number crunching, by that rationale Gary never
stood a chance, the computer 'seeing' over 30 moves ahead where he could see
only 9. And he also defeated the computer in at least one match. I never knew
it was programmed to deal with his particular style though, thats interesting
(to me anyway :P
It's reckoned now though that 75% of grandmasters wouldnt stand a chance
against the supercomputers.
