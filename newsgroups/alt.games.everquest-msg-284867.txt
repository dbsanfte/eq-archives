Since everyone else is seeing it correctly, you might consider installing 
the latest drivers for your video card, or uninstalling and re-installing 
them if already current.

Also, FYI, your post begins with a signature tag, or whatever it's called 
(double-dash plus space). I don't know if that was intentional or a 
"feature" of your news client, but it makes it a real pain for someone to 
reply in context.
