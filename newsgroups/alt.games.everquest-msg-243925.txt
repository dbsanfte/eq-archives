I asked this question in the alt.computer group as well.  I got one total
response which was a link.  LOL  I went to link and omg it was in greek... I
think...  =P

This was link given: http://www.dvdrhelp.com/

Ok, I betcha that is a GREAT site... IF I knew what I was looking for to begin
with...  

Basically here is the problem.  I want to transfer my old videos to DVD.  My
question is, in this day and age, isn't there some easy way to do that?  Like
some all in one unit or something?  If so, what would I look for?  

When I Google 'Video to DVD transfer' and other similar, I get a zillion links
for places that will do it for me...  Not what I want.  Is there a product out
there like the 'Dell Tranfer you Video to DVD Wonder Machine' or some other
thing I can walk into Office Max and ask for?  

I will keep looking at that link, but the more I read there, the more confused
I get...  :(

Thanks in advance gang,

Joolz
