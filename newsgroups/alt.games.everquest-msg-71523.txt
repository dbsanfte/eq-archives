I think the name filter already has most of the Big Names already in place. 
And the real offender in this regard so far has been Dragonlance.  I don't
think we'll see too many from LotR.

(Side Note: I got curious what all the Dragonlance fuss was about, so I read
the first book.  To call it bad would be an insult to all the bad books out
there.)

He was one of my favorite parts of the book.  One of my peeves with movies
today is that if they make a point of showing someone using, say, a melon
baller in scene 1, you know that that melon baller is going to play a
crucial role later on.

I think more movies should put in more WTF stuff, like Buckaroo Banzai did
with the watermelon.

But I understand why they cut him from the movie.

Nobody tosses this dwarf!

And I kept trying to place where I'd seen Elrond before.  Was a real
distraction until I recognized him as Agent Smith from the Matrix, which was
a bit of cognitive dissonance.
