Don't know.

Quite a few of my rightpondian friends are going, and I think a large
proportion of all euro players, enticed by friendly playing time, from
across the servers will make the move too. It'll likely be very crowded,
and top-heavy. I'm going to start a char there briefly and see what it's
like, but, it'll be difficult to leave my wacky sherman friends behind. 

The boats leaving soon though.

Fantastic. I've long been in favour of a Euro server, and now we've got
one, leaving the American server behind may prove to be too difficult
for me.
