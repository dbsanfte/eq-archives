I played diablo 1. I forget the character levels I reached. 30 I
think. But I used the trainers... it was just to waste time with.

I set goals for my toons in EQ 1.

Moments of wonder are always good to watch once in awhile.

They can dish it out to, but I take your point.

One thing about the tutorial, it doesn't stress having a wide range
of weapon types. The toon starts off with one weapon, and by the
time the toon reaches 5th or 6th level, leaves the tutorial, that
weapon skill is way up, and the rest are at zero. Becomes painful,
and lots of damage taken, to get other weapon skills up to the same
par. Not that there is a great weapon selection in the tutorial,
there isn't.

Nothing. But I am playing this to relax, not engage a steep learning
curve. I sometimes have to talk coworkers into how to log into the
same email program they have been using for years... so I like to
relax once in a while.

New players arrive all the time. So that player should have
remembered that not everyone knows everything about the game.

I go to the web sites and look for zones where my toons wont be
overwhelmed by way higher level monsters. Hasn't always worked, but
I do look first.

Well, depends on whose deifinition of relaxing we are using ? :-)

Info I didn't have earlier. Thanks.

I'll carry more bandages.
