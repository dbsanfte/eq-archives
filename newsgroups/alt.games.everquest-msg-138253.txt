Are you sure it wasn't some program on your computer?  I used to have 
problems with spikes but not in the last month or so.  Never had them so 
bad I got killed in game.  Only bothered me when I was surfing the net 
because I hate waiting for pages to load.  I went in Msconfig and killed 
a whole bunch of stuff that was unnecessary and it made a big 
difference.  Don't kill stuff that way unless you go to this site and 
look up what each thing is first 
http://www.modempool.com/loosecruise/msconfighelp.html
I didn't know what to kill and almost turned off needed files.
Made a big difference in stability in my system.  I don't crash as often 
and I can play for long periods without any problems.
