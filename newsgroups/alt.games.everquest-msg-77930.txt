I found this on the EQLive technical support board...
I tried and it did seem to make adifference.  Shar Vahl is still slow
but no longer unplayable....  It seems the patcher is missing this
updated dll in a standard file check
Quote from the tech board post:
http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/016265.html

"Curiosity got the better part of me, so I popped open the EQ
directory and located a file titled DPVS.DLL. I renamed the file to
DPVS.DLL.OLD and then proceed to run the patch program. As expected it
could not locate the file so it brought down another copy of it and I
noticed a slight oddity. The original file that I had now renamed had
a date of 11/23/2001 (11:53pm) while the newly loaded file had a date
of 11/29/2001 (2:26am). Both files, however, where the same size at
126kb each."
