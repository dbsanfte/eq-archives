It is obvious that this game is a mixture of gameplay and roleplaying.  To
knock someone that plays the game while sometimes disregarding the
roleplaying is to ignore the obvious.  You might as well say that anyone
that gets to Time has to be playing it wrong since (afaik) you are forced to
kill both good and evil gods.  That's the game *design*.
