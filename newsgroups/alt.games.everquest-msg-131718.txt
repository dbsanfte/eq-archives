    You also add DPS to a melee for fairly low mana output. You have damage
shields and a variety of mana-free DoTs (epic, Kunark arms, Velious bracer)
in addition to more efficient nukes that come in three resist types. In an
easy XP camp, where DPS is more important than healing, you are a better
choice for healer than a cleric. It's only when you go to more difficult
camps/situations that a cleric becomes preferred.

    And yeah, SH at 49 would help. ;-)
