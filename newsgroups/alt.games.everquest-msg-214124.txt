Sullon Zek - possible character deletion
The rules for the Sullon Zek server allow only characters from the
same alliance to be created on any one account.  Recently we
discovered a bug that has allowed some players to break that rule.

When we patch on the 9th, it will not be possible to log on to the
server if you have any characters that break that rule.  You will be
forced to delete any such character before you will be allowed to log
in.  All of your characters on that server must be on the same
alliance team.

Therefore, we highly recommend that you remove any gear you wish to
keep from those characters before we patch on the morning of Sept.
9th, 2003.
