My alt did something similar while looking for her level 15 and 22
shadow knight spells. I lost 50 pp by buying high level necro spells
instead of hitting 'done' and having to sell them back. (I also
managed to run to EC from Neriak with the wrong backpacks, and
completely forgot to hit 'purchase' when I finally found the endure
cold spell, which I need to train abjuration...)
