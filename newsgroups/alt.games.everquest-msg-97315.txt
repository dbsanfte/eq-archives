Like it has been said, there are any number of FAQ's and guides out 
there on it, try searching on http://www.google.com for "cleric guide".
A few things I will point out, having a 23rd lvl Dwarven Cleric are these.

1) Get used to looking at the spellbook (at least until they take this 
out, haven't had a chance to get on and play for a bit).

2) Know who your tanks are and who your nukers are.   Tanks, heal around 
60%, others a bit quicker because they're less likely to be able to take 
a number of hits.

3)  Make social hotkeys similar to "I am healing %t" Or "I am casting 
Celestial Remedy on %t"  These really help inform others, and, if you're 
lucky enough to have a second healer, let them know not to cast an 
additional heal on that person.

4) Get your disciple symbol that only dwarves get.... Mmmmm... Summoned 
Beer.  One of my favorite things to do is to /shout FREE BEER AT....

5) Don't be afraid to use your "panic button" Divine Aura, If there's 
anything else on the mobs hate list, it'll go to it.  Great way to clear 
5 mobs off you at once.  While I agree this spell is next to useless 
when soloing in Karanas or someplace without guards to run to, it's 
great in a group.

6) The mana updates are important too so the party knows whether to pull 
something or not.  For those that don't know, give it in percent, 1 blue 
bubble = 20%, therefore 1 and a half blue = 30m.  I generally announce 0 
20, 60, 80 and full.

7) When you get it, Stun can be a lifesaver too, it generaly casts 
pretty quick, and it can give the tanks time to get onto the mobs hate 
list while it's sitting there looking stupid.

Well, I know there are much more experienced players out there and I've 
proly skipped important stuff, but there's my 2cp
