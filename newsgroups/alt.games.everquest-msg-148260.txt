I got this from the download..
Grats, you have received most of Planes of Power..

This contains about 3/4 of the zones, enjoy them.

You must use test server code to use Planes of Power, so connect using
testeverquest.exe get those files

and then when starting eqw you can click use test server, or the patchme
feature on testeqgame.exe

EQEMu does support the test server code, however, you must source the
planes.sql file to the database.

You do this by entering your database using mysql.exe, then typing source
planes.sql (with planes.sql in your

x:\mysql\bin directory)

Have fun!
