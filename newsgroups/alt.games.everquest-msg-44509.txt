Actually, each time we have raided Growth, we have taken along at least one
druid.   They dont' get involved in the fighting, but they make excellent
scouts.   They can also spot the Protectors of Growth when they spawn, and if
they sit right on the spawn points, prevent the PoG's from spawning.  In
return, they get some of the druid spells for which Verant, in thier infinite
wisdom, made that zone the primary source.   They can also drag corpses,
although if they are aggroed for that they have to gate or die.
