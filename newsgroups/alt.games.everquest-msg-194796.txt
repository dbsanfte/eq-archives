Because I think that the suicide of an Everquest player would be 
automatically blamed on EQ, and publicized to buggery and back, as in 
the case of this Shawn fellow. Sony is too tempting a target for lawyers 
not to bring up the issue, however unrelated to the actual reasons for 
the suicide.

Also, I think EQ provides a) something to do and b) a social network for 
people who otherwise might not have one.
