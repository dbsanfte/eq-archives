Dan,
    create a dark elf level 1 character.  Log on your character with the
corpse, consent your new dark elf.  Use the dark elf to drag your corpse to
the zone.  Problem solved.  The guards in Nektulos hate all (or almost all)
good characters.  Later on in life, you will return and kill them.  They
aren't too tough, low 20s I think, maybe high teens.
