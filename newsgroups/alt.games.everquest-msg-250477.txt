Some of the most fun I've had have been in 3 man LDoNs - Necro, Ranger &
Beastlord, early 20s up to 30. 2 pets kinda make it a 5 man, but with your
setup, you've got tank/puller, healer/slower and dps/root. You shouldn't
have any problems.

I couldn't tell whether the difficulty was scaled back, as they were mostly
easy collects, which are hard to fail at at the best of times.
