The guild leaders account password was known to the leadership
council? Was that a policy or did they just make a lucky guess?

This is probably the best advice I got. I ended up silently deguilding
from the newly formed guild and returned to the old one. I had a nice
grouping session with the leader - just like in old times. I feel I
did the right thing, and that's probably what matters most.
