Well, sorry to say, but I'm not overly-concerned with my credibility.  Fine
& good that Voodoo isn't a company & that 3DFX was.  Either way, you still
know what I'm talking about, so why pick nits?

I don't really care whether they support 3DFX cards or not.  I guess in the
end, I really don't care whether they support Hercules/Guillemot.

Mainly, I was wondering if there was any difference in the cards' abilities
(?) that would make them officially support one over the other.
