Enough people seem to be saying this that I am coming to the conclusion
that my experience (which is the direct opposite) appears to be a complete
anomaly.....so as to the splitting, I think its bind for CRs and then
'tactical' binds for gates being considered seperately and possibly being
made a different spell (assuming of course that the staus quo is to be
disturbed....not trying to advocate change, merely what I would consider
to be the bext way to make a change should it be considered necessary)
