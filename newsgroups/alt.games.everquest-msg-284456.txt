Ack! That was a very difficult time for my bard. Hours spent killing
mobs then racing back to the "alleged" Eldrig spawn point and kill each
non-Eldrig that spawned, only to scream like a little girl for help
from my guild when he finally *did* pop (it turns out the intel was
good on the location). It's one of those quest mobs that just baffles
me when I wonder how anyone ever could have figured it out in the
beginning through simple trial and error.

Great write-up, Lance. You always make me wanna take off early from
work and go home to play. :)
