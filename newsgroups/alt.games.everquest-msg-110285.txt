  Well then you're talking about totally redoing boats... a huge project
that's going to take a lot of time to complete, an in the interim at least,
I'd like the boats to be fixed or sped up, or would enjoy some sort of
alternative (which the Nexus has done, to an extent... I haven't used the
Erud's Crossing boats since I got Luclin).  Plus, I DO think there is an
element of fun in riding a horse or teleporting, if it's well executed and
if it's immersive.  In Zelda 64, I would sometimes spend 20 minutes doing
nothing but riding around on the horse because I thought it was fun.  At
least you have some element of control over riding a horse, or running
around, or finding a teleport.  You're DOING something.  You're not just
sitting on a dock, or sitting on a deck.  You do have to sit around at the
nexus spires, but at least you can go AFK without fear of missing the boat,
and at least it the wait times are not all that bad (considering the
distance travelled).

  I would be all for better boats, and boats that are a platform for
adventures... maybe the ocean zones could have ships that have NPCs and
quests, that you could visit and raid.  That might be interesting.  But to
be honest, I don't have a lot of confidence in Verant to implement something
like this properly.  Quests, NPCs, dungeons and boats are buggy enough on
their own... to combine all of these things into one would probably be
several orders of magnitude more difficult than doing them all independently
of each other.  I would rather that they focus on fixing the boats and
making them a faster and more reliable form of transportation, or to give us
alternatives to the boats.

  They can put sea adventures in EQ2, since they have the oppurtunity to
rebuild the game engine from the ground up without fears of making things
incompatible with "legacy" systems that support the game.  If they're going
to do it, they should do it right and not try to cram it into EQ1 where the
support systems for those sorts of things just aren't in place.
