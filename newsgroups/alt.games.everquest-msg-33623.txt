You make it too hard;

Hand in one, see what he says
Hand in another... repeat as necessary till he gives you exp.

If you are lucky, thats one, two, or three... if not, heck, its
four, and that's what you were -supposed- to hand in!
Your way, you need 7 in order to be sure you aren't
wasting any.  Mine takes only four on hand.

There is at least one quest (in Freeport, IIRC) where you
need to hand in two of an item, but the item is lore.  Safe
way to do this is to do it with a buddy, so you can have him
hand in the second one if needed.... but half the time you'll
find you get exp for handing in just the one!
