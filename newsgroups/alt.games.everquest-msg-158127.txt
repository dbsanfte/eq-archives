Sorry for the off-topic post, but I heard the bad news today about the
plane crash in Eveleth, MN that killed Senator Paul Wellstone, his
wife Sheila and daughter Marcia, his campaign staff members Will
McLaughlin, Tom Lapic and Mary McEvoy, and the two pilots Richard
Conry and Michael Guess.

I don't live in Minnesota now, but I really admired Sen. Wellstone;
being a "liberal Democrat" myself, I voted for him for his first two
elections and, were I still living there, I would have voted for him
for his third one.  I never met him, but I did go to the Uptown
Theater in Minneapolis to attend the premiere of "American Dream"
(Barbara Kopple's documentary about the Hormel meat plant strike)
where he introduced the film and he gave a nice speech.

What I most admired about him was his passion for what he believed in
and his refusal to compromise on issues he felt strongly about, even
if he was in the minority (most recently he voted against legislation
to authorize military force in Iraq, the only Democrat in a
competitive race to vote against it).  He was definitely one of the
"good guys".  

Anyway, my condolences go to the family and friends of the victims of
today's plane crash.
