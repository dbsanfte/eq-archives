But people duoing everywhere else got a 20% boost and people in
larger groups got 20% -more- boost everywhere else than they did
in POP, plus people soloing anywhere but in POP got no nerf at
all.  Because it wasn't a solo nerf, it was a POP nerf, and
groups got a bonus; the net effect on the people that happened to
be soloing in POP was an apparant solo nerf, but if the two
changes had happened on two seperate patches it would have been
much clearer.

POP was nerfed, groups were boosted, it just happens to have
happened simultaneously... and then been "spun" by SOE as a solo
nerf for reasons of their own.
