I wouldn't think so.. if they went in to do the transfer and you were
playing the character (basically I've known it to take up to a week, or so
I've been told), a GM will probably send you a tell.  I wouldn't think you'd
have to wait a week without touching the character.  They can't make the
move with you in game, but you have no idea when they will get to you, so..
well, I would just play the char.
