When, how often, and under what circumstances?

For example, did the Cleric have to be enticed to travel across
four zones, into a dangerous area, while delaying the dinner he
had planned to have with his wife twenty minutes ago?

Sometimes what you're asking for has to be accompanied by a
price which makes it worth the other person's time/risk.

I have *never* seen a Cleric charge even 100p for a simple,
"as long as I'm here by your corpse anyway..." rez.  You're
usually not paying for the rez, you're paying for how much
burden you're placing on the guy you want the help from.
