You're not cleaning up the mess at all, you're making it worse. And
anyways, the actions of the European nations in the past is just that
- in the past. They aren't still holding the Middle East under their
thumb. On the other hand, the political reasons for waging war on the
US are still active.

I don't think any part is. The fundamental reasons for terrorism
against the US by arab states haven't been addressed at all - they
aren't even being acknowledged. *That* is the 'head'.

So what? It's the Americans who are doing it *now*. And all of those
fall under "political". I am not wrong at all.

And as you kill one supplier another six will rise.

What you should focus on is preventing the need for drugs. That's not
really possible with the war on drugs, but it is in the war on
terrorism. Your solution only means prolonging the war for the
forseeable future without ever solvig anything. Mine would end the
problem.

The current situation is mostly involving Americans. You erroneously
presuppose that resentment over the 20+ year past is a primary cause
of arab terrorism. It's a factor but a minor one. It's what is
happening *now* they don't like.

The *specific* actions the US took part in - taking over arab states
by the use of puppets to get a modicum of control over the oil
reserve, and the blank check support of Israel - is what put the US at
the top.


> You assertion that they
>would not be on the list at all if they had stayed out is erroneous.

No, it's not. Once again you buy the propoganda telling you that its
religion solely fuelling the hatred. It's not. It's politics and
economics. Religion is the excuse, the enemy propoganda.


>The list is long and all of the big names in Europe are on it.

And yet France and the rest aren't being targetted. Only the UK...
because its government is aping the US.

Gee, coincidence?

Face it. There's more (and in a way, less) involved than you are
admitting. This is targetted at the US because its the US that is the
biggest problem for them.

You failed to answer the question. What other reason is the US there

That much is true.

No, what they are doing is getting revenge for what was done to them.
Just like France and England during Versailles. Revenge against the
culprits was fine, and so goodbye al Qaeda, no one will miss you. But
like France and England, you are taking it too far, and going after
everything you can. Result? An armistice for 20 years as they put it
then.

Apparently you don't learn from history as well as you think.

Need we mention he was hamstrung by a congress that opposed his

Bush is the current England/France of the situation, not the Wilson.
It frightens me that you don't see that. The parallels are obvious.

The Us's history is filled with them pretending the problems aren't

You keep saying this, but you keep failing to prove it.

Appeasing is not the idea. Solving the problems that is causing the
hatred is the idea. Sure that is bad for the oil companies and for
Israel, but do you think its not worth it?

Glad you decided to sacrifice how many thousands of lives for those
few. I bet they're *really* happy you chose that.

Incorrect. I give it its true place in the scheme of things without
trying to shift responsibility as you are doing.

That's what the US does best, isn't it? Shifting the buck? Those damn
imperialist Europeans are the root of all evil? While ignoring the US
doing the very same thing?

Right. There's no reason for them to have any grudge against the US at
all, it's all the Europeans fault.

Wake up.

You are doing it now. Were you not aware of that?

Your blank check support is the sole reason it stands as it does now.
Were you not aware of that?

The truth bears little resemblance to your reality.
