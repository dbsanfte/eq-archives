Having played both CoH and EQ2 I agree it's not so great. To start
with if I'm the low one lvl I fell like I'm a charity case. That my
friends are doing be a favour.

Seeing your high lvl char gimped, losing all the skills and dieing at
the hands of a mob you would normally 1 hit kill isn't much fun for
long. The temptation of switch back, power level your low-level friend
through and then go off and explore new areas is very great.  Playing
down works as a temporary fix but few people would want to be in this
situation for long. (A fair better idea would be to drag out a long
forgotten alt of the same level.)

A much better longterm solution is to enable the low level char to
temporary increase his level to roughly match yours. This isn't
without it problems too. While your level increases your skills and
equipment don't. So, if anyone going to die it will inevitably be the
low level guy. Still, that's the price you pay and as long as I
didn't die and get debt it didn't bother. It did give me as a
healer a real headache though. You had to watch them like a hawk. One
person in a group was manageable but 2 or more and you've got real
problems.

Still, temporary raising a low-level char level so he can play with you
was always the preferred option in CoH. People generally avoided doing
the reverse for any length of time.
