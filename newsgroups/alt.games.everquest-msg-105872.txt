An example would be the mob named "Pain and Suffering" in Lavastorm.  That
mob shows up on track, so you can find and kill him without ShowEQ.

You can also use ShowEQ to find and attack mobs that have fallen through the
world.  Use ShowEQ to get above the mob, and cast an AOE spell.

Another thing people do that gives them away is running straight toward a
rare spawn on the other side of the zone, as soon as it spawns, when there
are no trackers in the zone.

Many GMs and guides use ShowEQ, and people using it to blatlantly track rare
spawns really stand out to them.
