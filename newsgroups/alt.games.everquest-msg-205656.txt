Indeed.  I must say, I'm a very hopeful for LDoN and this concept.
VERY hopeful.

We did a Veksar 'crawl' one of the first days it was up.  Hardly
anyone in the zone, so mostly just our group - with no maps or clues
as to where we might be headed.  Was a LOT of fun and brought back
some old memories of those first forays into other dungeons.  Going
deep into Seb is still a blast for me, even though it isn't anything
new anymore.
