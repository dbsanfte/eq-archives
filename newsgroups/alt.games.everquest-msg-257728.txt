I should add to that that we don't know much about what buffs exist in the
game. WE have been told that the buffs that affect combat abilities can
only be given by members of your group (they have to use concentration ala
DAOC to maintain them as well), and that certain other buffs do not need
to be.  THe question is whether anyone can find combat advantages from
these "other buffs"...I don't have enough information to speculate on
that.
