I make it a policy not to port people I feel are too low to port.  Lower
level characters should run to their destinations and be damn glad they got
there! Newbies these days want everything handed to them!

Neither of my main characters (51 Druid and 25 SK) saked for or received a
port before 25. I think 25 is a good level to have earned your 'wings' for
porting.

If I'm not busy I will TP 25+ for free. Have not charged for a TP EVER!

Everyone else will have to...OMG...actually RUN across a zone or 6!

However Caelano will port anyone to Permafrost, just ask!
