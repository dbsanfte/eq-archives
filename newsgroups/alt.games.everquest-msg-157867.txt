I'm glad that somebody has a sense of humor =).  I actually agree with
the original poster about a guild taking a break to let people explore
PoP - but...

he signed up for duty so that when he logs into Everquest somebody
else can tell him where to be and when to be there.  From what I've
seen of these high level raiding guilds (ok, from one high level
raiding guild), they have a lengthy write up of exactly what is
required of guildies (and if there is no formal write-up, I'm sure
that they have ways of making such requirements known). Why should I
be upset when his guild leader exercises the authority the poster gave
him?   I won't join a guild for precisely that reason, but it means
that there are things my character will never have.   You give, you
get.
