I've struggled through killing rockhoppers till my fingers bleed trying to
get enough flawless hides to master tailoring. They are light blue mostly
now but still xp mobs. I still get harassed by people farming them solo...
as in the whole caves, only takes one decent enchanter or bard or a tough
melee type... or by lower levels who think they are not level appropriate
for me.

I think either sony should make those quest components droppable or make
better rules for camping and police them. I think it's unlikely they will;
GMs cost money! But I think that they group who moved in on him was in the
wrong and was greedy, and should have proposed a compromise. A mob you have
to kill for a quest is 'level appropriate' for anyone. It's called everQUEST
because the quests are supposed to be important, not Evergrind dammit!

 It would be nice if you could have some way of seeing what others were
looting/destroying so that you could 'group' with others and powerlevel them
or whatever without being robbed. I also think that rogue pickpocketing
shouldn't work on a mob that's aggro either, but i guess neither is likely
to happen.
