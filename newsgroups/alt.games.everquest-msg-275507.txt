T3 strongboxes on my server are now their lowest they have ever been, 85s. 
Sadly they will only get lower as more people make them (furniture obviously 
doesnt sell), eventually there will come a time when everyone has all the 
boxes they need and we wont be able to give them away.

Wait till you get past 25 in carpentry, it's a nightmare levelling up. I had 
to make 100 ash tables to level from 29-30. I couldnt give these away and 
ended up selling to the merchant for 12s each. This paid for my fuel etc and 
left me with a small profit. It was a pain but I was happy as I had levelled 
and I really wanted to see what T4 beds etc were like.

To do what I did isnt now possible anymore, you will either have to find 
someone to buy your furniture (good luck!) or craft at a loss. Because we 
cant create pristine primary components with our skill it's going to cost 
you even more.

I was also giving away furniture to guildies and friends, I wont even be 
able to do that anymore :(

Overall I just feel fed up. It seems that crafter are treated as 2nd class 
citizens by SoE. It's a real shame as I was enjoying my carpenter and was 
looking forward to hitting 50.
