Just because a weapon is magical does not mean it has any added bonuses.
Some monsters require that you have a magical weapon to be able to hit them.
Some magical weapons give off light and do not have this ability listed
under their properties.

If you group with someone and like their company, and they are a member of a
Guild then ask them if their guild is recruiting new members.  Bringing in
new members differ from guild to guild but if you join a guild that has
atleast one person who you like to group with then there is a good chance
that there will be other members of the same guild that you would like to
group with.  Some guilds require that a member sponser you.  So, try to get
yourself into a good guild.  It is always nice when you are in a guild and a
level 50+ member has some gear he wants to get rid of.  Also guilds are
where most raids are planned.  Higher level members may decide to have a
Power-leveling party.  Never know.

The game has changed since I was a level 14 Barbarian.  The new POP porting
is a big help in this reguard.  When I hit my teens I started hunting in the
Northern Desert, south of Freeport.  There are bugs and snakes there that
you can pull all day without trains developing.  Watch out for the higher
level skeletons, mummys and zombies that come out at night.  And there use
to be a Cutthoat Bully that was seriously underconned who hung out in a
bandit camp near the water.  Avoid this guy at all cost.  He will spank you
at your level.  Whenever I go through this zone and I have some spare time,
I always go over to this guy and spank him good.  Too many bad memories when
I was younger and he killed me.  You could also move to the oasis of mar.  I
did that in my high teens.  There is also a Mermaid Island that is between
Butcherblock and freeport.  I think you pass the Island on the trip from
Freeport to Butcherblock but I may be wrong.  When the game was first
released, this little spot of dirt was a highly contested camp.  You can
kill these mermaids all day and easilly level from 14-17 just on them.  The
game has changed so much though that I am sure there are other places now.

Once you hit 20, head to Lake Of Ill Omen.  Atleast that is what I did
pre-Luclin expansion.  In that zone you can EASILLY hunt from level 20-30.
At level 30 you can go into Frontier Mountains and Hunt.  Then in your mid
30s, The Over There was a hot spot.  Once you hit 40, The Dreadlands was
perfect.  A lot of things have changed but I think this strategy is still a
good strategy.  Once you make it to Lake Of ill Omen, the PP should start
coming in better.  I have never played a Beastlord but once you are in your
30s you may be able to take on a Hill Giant in the Karanas.  Just make sure
you find out for sure.

If you go to www.eqatlas.com you will find every map you will need.  The guy
that runs that site was selling his whole collection in PDF format for
$9.95.  Well worth the money compared to the crappy map that Sony is trying
to sell in stores.  There is a link at eqatlas.com to alakazam.com(I know I
spelled that wrong).  Alakazam is your one stop location for EVERYTHING
Everquest.
