Hello everyone!

Last night I was taking my Enchanter to Velketor's Labyrinth.  Before I went
in I cast Improved Invis on myself.  As soon as I zoned over I got kicked to
the desk top and couldn't log that character back in for almost a half hour,
and when I was able to try and log back in it happened again.  I can log
other charactes from that account in just not the Enchanter.  I even tried
loggin in on two different computers with no luck.  Anyone have any
sujestions on what to do?

Thanks!
