What's the difference from them doing that than to have the IGN drones
sitting in Hong Kong and camp all the mobs? As you say it is a
interactive skill now, that you can die from, so how much different is
it to spend 8 hours making crafting items to sell to vendors than it
is to camp mobs for 8 hours and sell the loot to vendors?

Personnally I'd like to be able to think that my time is worth
something. In EQ1 it's as if the moment I touch the crafting materials
they lose 90% of their value.

I can understand the reasoning in EQ1, because it's trivial to set up
a macro keyboard to click combine and auto inventory while away from
the keyboard, so you have to stop people from manufacturing plat, but
if the situation prevents doing that, why should it end up costing me
more money to buy the materials than I can sell the finished product
for?
