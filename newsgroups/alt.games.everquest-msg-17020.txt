/quit:

Some uses for it are to quickly log out of the game (without all the
rigmarole of camping, etc) if you're in an area that you know is safe.  Or
if you know you're safe due to invis, etc.

And, yes, I've known of people (and even done it once or twice myself) who
/quit out to simulate a linkdeath in order to ditch a group that was either
irritating, annoying or just wasn't working out.

Most of the time /quit is used by feign death folks (Necro, Monk, SK) when
they need to break aggro after feigning.  Basically once they've feigned and
the mob leaves them alone they /quit out.  This is to make sure aggro gets
broken because after mobs hit level 35 or so they don't forget about you
very easily, especially if there are a bunch of them.  So the FD'd person
/quits out, weights for about 2 minutes to allow his character to time out
and then logs back in.  The hope is that the mobs have cleared out and he's
safe.  If not he can just FD and /quit again.

It's a very useful tactic when pulling in the planes or any other major
dungeon.
