We were audited by the Business Software Alliance in Calif. Company laid off
some people and we were reported. I have a cloning machine and can clone up
to 6 drives at a time, and I was told its nothing to get into a huff about.
We have Master drives preloaded with OS (Win 98, 2000, and XP), Office 97,
MRP, all preloaded. BSA had no complaint with that just as long as we could
provide a valid license for each machine, which we did and then some. We did
get a few write ups on enduser loaded stuff (games, and Norton Commander)
but overall no problems.
