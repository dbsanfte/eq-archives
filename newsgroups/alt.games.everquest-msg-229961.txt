Some advice from an ex-druid, throw out that 56 root and only ever use
the level 4 root. Casts .5 secs faster and requires so little mana it
is easy to cast many times or if you are Oom, little time to gain
enough mana to use. Most of all it breaks at the same rate as the high
end roots (Can't speak for post 60 roots).

I used the higher end root when I used to camp forager cycle with the
higher end root till a druid mentioned to me not use it, So I used the
4th level root. I never went back to ther higher end root.


And yes the Shadows do break and resists root very often so if you are
low on mana; well worth waiting before you pull.
