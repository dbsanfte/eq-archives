Of course the Gm is nice here in this example, now have a legitimate gripe
(died while zoning) and ask a GM for a rez, get a answer of "no", then
demand one, oops now you are suspended.  Go figure, but this guy can train,
curse, insult, offend and "hey buddy calm down and cancel so you can come
back"
That's bs! Lead Gm should have summoned him, and then banned him, then
logged him out. 1, 2, 3.
