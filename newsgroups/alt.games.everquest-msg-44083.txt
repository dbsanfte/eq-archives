Personally, I would just use a fist and the EoD instead of an enameled black
mace. At least that way you get to raise HTH.
I feel like sharing my tactic to get a monk to 14 in a day:
1 Get a good weapon for whacking stuff with, armor really doesn't matter at all
unless you have a fungus tunic. I used a Smoldering Brand (standard twink
weapon for all my chars).
2 Until about level 3, kill in freeport.
3 Go to the EC tunnel...pay for the following buffs:
SOW
Symbol
Heroic Bond
Chloroplast
24-point damage shield
This should get you about 600 (I think) extra HP, plus regen. 
4 Whack mobs until you have a lot on you, then meleeing them while they all hit
on you. They'll die really fast.

Repeat steps 3 and 4 as needed.

Ok, anyway, I just felt like typing that.
