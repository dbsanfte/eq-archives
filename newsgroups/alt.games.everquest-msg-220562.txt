	Franklin got out and about quite a bit actually.  One of the advantages of
his fairly neutral personality was that he worked well with just about
everyone.  The two Mars runs were good examples.

	He just didn't develop over the series.  The Franklin who left at the end
was pretty much the Franklin who arrived at the beginning.  There were some
significant events in the middle (I'm rewatching the series now and "Shadow
Dancing" is the next one up), but they didn't really seem to *impact* the
character any.
