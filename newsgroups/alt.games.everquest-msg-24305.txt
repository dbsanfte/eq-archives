I basically traded all the time I spent watching a few hours of TV at night
to interacting with my TV at night.

I made some friends. We have some laughs, get frustrated, get elated, joke
around and generally have a fun time.

I still kiss my wife, have a drink (logged on in Chardok the other day - how
the heck did I get there?), go to movies, read lots of books, go camping,
have barbeques with my neighbors, play poker twice a month and have a
full-time job.

The only thing I've sacrificed is understanding how people can sit in front
of a TV watching 'Survivor', 'Big Brother' or ANYTHING on UPN (besides Buffy
and Star Trek of course : P ).

That being said, I know a couple folks who play 24/7. It's not my place (or
yours) to tell them to live their lives the way I think they should live
them. We're all headed for the same dirt nap anyway. Might as well go out
with a full set of Planar armor.
