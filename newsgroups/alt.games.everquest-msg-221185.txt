A paladin's best aggro spell is his level 9 stun.  To really lock
things down he'll want to use a couple of higher level stuns as
well... but still nothing expensive.  A level 65 stun doesn't
aggro the mob any more than that level 9 one does, it merely
costs more mana.... and sticks better and so forth of course.  So
the plan is, use the level 9 stun every time it pops, and use the
high level one the instant the mob turns its back on you, which
will probably stick and stun the mob preventing it from doing
anything for several seconds, and will likely aggro it enough to
return its attention to you anyway.

The same effect happens with a shadowknight; his best aggro
producer is his level 9 snare/dot, because its not important what
the spell does, all he needs is the aggro off it, and any snare
will do for that, so the cheaper the better.  If he needs the
snare to stick he might have to cast something higher level...
but for regular "lets keep the aggro on me, m'kay?" work he can
mostly just keep casting the dirt cheap stuff whenever it pops
up.

If your Knights are having mana troubles, with Clarity on (after
all, you are a 51 chanter, so they'd better have clarity), then
they are trying to do more than just lock aggro with their
spells.  Imagine a level 9 enchanter with Clarity, does he have
any trouble keeping mana for mezzing?

Well, DPS classes don't have anything to worry about really, the
warrior would need  a really massive boost to become competitive
with them in the DPS field.

I don't think "other classes" are a concern in general, its
specifically SK and Paladins... well and arguably monks, who've
been nerfed into the stone age because of it.  It would be
possible to have Warriors become great healers, mezzers, or DPS
people... but that would leave just two Sponges, and be fairly
weird; would make more sense to me to have the warriors go back
to being competitive for the sponge position, fattening up the
pool back to three classes (well, its never been three, it used
to be only two, warriors and monks, and now its still only two,
SK and Paladin)
