Yes, however, suppose you know the difference between red and crimson.
If the car is the shade crimson, would you refer to it as red, or as
crimson?

Similarly, there is a difference between accusation and insinuation.
An insinuation is a type of accusation, however, if Annie (or I)
recognize the difference between the two, is it not more correct to
refer to it as the specific type of accusation, i.e., an insinuation?

No matter.

As it is, Ben was correct that an accusation was made.  But Annie was
also correct that it was specifically an insinuation.  In that regard,
Ben's counter that "No, it was an accusation" is wrong.

Ben - It's a car.
Annie - It's a corvette Stingray.
Ben - No, it's a car.
