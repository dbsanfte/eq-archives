It's also quite ironic that he would accuse you of not being able to
killfile when he himself said he did and then *continued to reply* (as
so many posers do). The only argument he has against that is to say
when HE "ignores" someone it has nothing to do with killfiling but
when he speaks of someone else "ignoring" someone, it does. He is hung
by his own petard. He has to admit to either lying or being a
hypocrite.

Truly the amount of newbishness he has shown in this thread is
astonishing for someone who claims to be around as long as he has. But
then, some people are very slow learners.....
