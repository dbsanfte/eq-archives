Honestly tried to find information on this online, but doing a websearch for
"everquest stamina hit points" just doesn't quite work right, so I thought
I'd come and ask you guys since I've learned so much already from this NG.
Anyway, here goes.

Was curious if anyone knows the formulas that relate your stats to your
AC/HP/ATK numbers?

Stamina - HP

Agility - AC

Strength and ?Dexterity? - ATK

and for that matter AC - AC (since the total of all the AC on my armor is
much less than my real AC).

As a Beastlord I know I can figure out the Strength, Stamina, Dexterity side
of it all, but not Agility and also that only works for my current level.
More wondering what extra points in each stat will do for me as I get into
the 50's and later (much later it seems) the 60's.

I'm having a feeling this isn't gonna be one of those hard and fast formulas
like Bind Wound etc is, but any clues or ideas would be most appreciated.
Thanks in advance.
