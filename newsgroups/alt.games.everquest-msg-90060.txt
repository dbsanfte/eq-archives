I know two level 60 wood elf warriors on the Tunare server. I know at least
one of them has their epics or better. (Had them a bit after they came out).
Dont know him to well but I understand he is a bad-ass. Name is Blitzberg.

Dont know the other one but I have done "/w war woo 50 60" a few times and
seems to be a fair number. (Granted less then other races but still)

I myself am a wood elf warrior and enjoy my race very much. High dex and agi
is pretty nice but I will admit str and sta being low is a bad thing. If you
do pick them put at least 90 str and the rest on sta.
