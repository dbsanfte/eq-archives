Well, yes and no.

As I understand it, you'll be able to cause more melee damage while
spellcasting this way (versus how things used to work), but you'll
still probably decrease your melee damage if you spellcast, depending on
the timing.

I believe you won't do any melee swings while actually casting, but
unlike before, you now won't have to start your swing delay all over
again after the casting is finished.

Let's say you're using a weapon with a delay of 30 (3.0 seconds).

Old way:  Whatever you cast, you have to wait until it's done casting,
then wait another 3.0 seconds before you swing your weapon again.

New way (again, this is my understanding, may not necessarily be
correct):  You'll be "ready to swing" either 3.0 seconds after your
last swing, OR immediately after you're done casting, WHICHEVER COMES
LATER.

Best case example:  1.0 seconds after your last swing, you cast a
spell with a 1.5 second cast time.  You then swing your weapon 0.5
seconds after the spell is done (exactly when you would have anyway
even if you hadn't cast the spell) -- no loss in melee damage (hooray).

Worst case example:  2.9 seconds after your last swing (0.1 seconds
before you were about to swing again), you cast a spell that takes
4.5 seconds to complete.  You don't swing during the casting, but
you swing the instant the spell is finished.  However, this is still
7.4 seconds after your last swing, so casting the spell has made you
miss a couple of swings, and lowered your melee damage output  But
it's still an improvement over the old system, whereby you wouldn't
have been able to swing until a full 10.4 seconds after your last
swing.

The lesson is that to maximize your melee output under the new
system, cast any spells you need to cast immediately after
you've just swung your weapon.  (This was also the best
strategy under the old rule, but you get a lot more results
with the new system.)  And for a change, it'll be possible
to lose no melee damage at all if you use only short-duration
spells and time them just right.
