Actually, I have.  =)

They have.  When we have to bring a server down for something like that,
it's an emergency.  Thus we call it Emergency Downtime, and do our best to
let people know that it's an emergency and it has to come down.

But we never have the gumption to call it "scheduled" downtime.  That's my
beef with SOE.  Again, in the business world, bringing down a server with
less than a day's notice is *not* scheduled.  It's unscheduled, an emergeny
shutdown that you darned well better justify afterwards.
