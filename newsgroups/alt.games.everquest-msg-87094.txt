When I dinged 51 (monk), I went 50/50.  I'll keep it that way till I'm
almost ready to hit 52, then switch probably to either 90% or 100% to
aaxp.  My reasons: I haven't even begun to work on my epic and the early
camps involve mobs that will be green if I advance any further in
levels.  Also as a puller class, having even Run Speed 1 will be a big
help in outdistancing damage from pulls.  Being 52 and below means being
able to do dragon raids, which are generally fun.  If I somehow accrue 6
aaxp before 55, I will go 100% back to regular level gain (until 55), as
any more skill points would be a waste of time really.  Last thought:
there's many more things to kill at 51 then there is at 60 (or even high
50s), and remember there's a gazillion soloing 60s out there looking for
the exact same spots to suck up aaxp that you might be looking for too
at 60.  If you solo a lot this, is a pretty important factor.  Go to
SolB and do who /w monk on any given night :p.

The flip side of this, if I feel like I'm getting left behind by guild
and friends simply because of my low level, I'll likely swap back to
normal exp gain.
