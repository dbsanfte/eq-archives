That program has not been updated in quite a while.
Didn't the caps change with the melee balancing that
happened last fall? I think so and Copelands program
does not account for those.

As far as the 1 delay in difference consider the percentage
change. 1 delay difference from a 48 to a 47 weapon is only
a 2% difference. 18 to 17 is 5.8% much more than trivial.
