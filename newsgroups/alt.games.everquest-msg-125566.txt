I'm not sure this will work but try using a chipped bone rod to target your 
corpse. Then stand as close to the wall as possible and type "/loot".

I use a similar tactic when trying to loot mob corpses that are stuck in 
walls, treestumps, etc. though in those cases I still need to be able to 
see part of the name to target the corpse.
