17.5% for UK, high for some other Euroland states.

This is jsut another "Stealth Tax" found by the governements.

VAT stands for Value added Tax. We pay VAT on pruchase of the game as it is
classed as a luxury. Online time is not a luxury IMO, there is no added
value at all. This is a total scam but nothing we can do as it is a scam
made by the government.
