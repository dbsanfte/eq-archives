Well, unless you have OOC set as your default channel, and you type:
<enter>SHIT!<enter>.

I have found myself talking to someone in the room and typing what I'm
saying to them.  You are assuming that everyone is just exactly the
same as you are.  God made us all special in our own way, and one of
the ways is that some people really can type with no more thought than
they would give to speaking.
