I first started out on the RallosZek server on day one of the game
being released.  I started an erudite wizard and my roomate started an
ogre shadow knight.  Well, we both made our way up to about lvl 10 and
then we decided we should get our characters together so that we could
actually group together.  So I asked for days how I would get to the
ogre town, and I finally got some directions from a guy and he was
telling me I needed to go through highpass.  Well, during these first
days, no one camped the orcs in highpass, so getting through there as
a lvl 10 wizard was a real bitch... I would run up to highpass, die,
run back get corpse, die, run back, get corpse, die, and I did this
for an entire weekend trying to find some way around those guys.  I
eventually just gave up and told my roomate if we are getting
together, one of us will have to make a new character in the other
guys town.

About a month later, someone told me the right way of getting there...
going through SK.
