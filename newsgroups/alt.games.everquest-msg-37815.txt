So how would you feel if you saw a banker thank someone for handing
him a FBSS, plat diamond rings, etc.? The guy who did it on my server
apparently had a bunch of slackjawed level 30s and 40s around as he
did that.
Not twinking newbies is one thing, but rubbing the noses of even
midlevels in the fact that you can't even be bothered selling stuff
they'd be climbing over each other to get is another matter entirely.
