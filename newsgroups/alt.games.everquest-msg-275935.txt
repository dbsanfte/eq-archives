Hi, I am looking for recent, first-hand knowledge of an account being banned for an
attempted character transfer in violation of the EULA.  I need to assess the risks
involved.

I have been given 2 of accounts, each of which has 1 character that I desire to keep.

The accounts are guild hand-me-downs, with very early start dates.  They have both been
through multiple owners with regards to the billing information.  There is no chance that
I will be able to contact the original owner to 'borrow' his registration information.

I want to move both characters to a 3rd, brand-new account, which I will create with EQ
Platinum Edition.  This would lessen my monthly subscription fees, as well as give both
characters access to GoD.

I would transfer one character immediately, and the other after my next payday :->

What are the risks?  Does SOE ban accounts when transfers like these pop up on their
radar?  If so, is there any real risk to **my** primary account, which would be unrelated
to these activities save for my name on the account?
