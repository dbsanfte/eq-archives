Not everyone has Broadband and a Mac/Win newsreader.

When I started on Usenet, I wanted my posts to STAND OUT (yeah, yeah... I'm
capping again... at least it's not Cyrilic-HTML!!) ;o)

I tried .rtf format posting... it sucked...
I tried HTML... pay-per-minute DialUp people flammed me to a crisp

So I stick to plain text... it's now a habit ;o)

My main e-mail is a Yahoo account (the addy above is long dead)... because I
tend to switch ISPs regularly. Only the first 6mb are free... and I still
get people trying to send 1mb+ MSWord documents to tell me there's a meeting
I need to be at sometime next week.

If it's important... plain text is enough to convey the message.
If you have time to mess about with HTML and MSWord clipart... it's
obviously not important enough to be bothering ME with it! :o)
