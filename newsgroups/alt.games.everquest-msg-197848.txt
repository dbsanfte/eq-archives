I love this comic, although I think there's a bit too much hype.  I find it
cute and amusing, but after every strip the WTF forum is filled with
"Laughing so hard tears were coming out of my eyes!" and "Literally ROFL!"
comments that leave me puzzled.  It's amusing, occasionally prompting a
chuckle, but it's not laugh-out-loud hysterical.

Nice drawings.  Straha, the artist, has a lot of problems with the
placements of his text balloons and keeping that text readable.  But that's
the only real flaw, and the art is pleasing to the eye.

I, too, enjoy reading the antics of Annashi as she steps wide-eyed into the
greater world of Everquest.  It's a nice blending of Norrath mythology and
real-life game mechanics.  I liked the troll shaman peering at the warrior
and asking, "Youse got the agro yet?" before casting slow.

I do recommend it.  Don't expect it to be the funniest thing you've ever
read since Bloom County ended, but I do think y'all will enjoy reading it.

As an aside, I think WTF is the wrong title, as WTF is not limited to
Everquest and doesn't really convey the spirit of the comic strip well.  But
hey, it's good enough that I don't let the title bother me.  =)
