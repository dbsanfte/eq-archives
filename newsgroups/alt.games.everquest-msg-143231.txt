If you look at the chips on the RAM, it will have a long part number
silkscreened onto it.  If it's the part offensive to ASUS (but not everyone
else), it will start with an MT and have a bunch of numbers after it (like
12 or 13 digits).

If you have a good relationship with a local dealer, you might ask them to
"loan" you some different sticks of memory for a day to see if that makes
any difference.  The way it usually works for me with the guy I do business
with is that I pay for the memory with the understanding that I will be
bringing it back inside of 48 hours, and when I do, I get a refund w/o the
restock fee.  That might be the best way to go, if you can afford it.  (If
the office weren't paying for it, I wouldn't be able to afford it.)

ASUS boards really aren't the worst as far as motherboards go, but I don't
think they're really supportive of VIA or AMD.

And again, check your BIOS to make sure it's the latest version, as well as
the VIA 4-in-1's.  The most recent version is 4.42, though EPoX only has
4.40 on their website, so you may want to check ASUS' website instead of
VIA's to see which one they're offering for download.
