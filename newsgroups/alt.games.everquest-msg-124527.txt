Me and some friends have determined how the government is able to do these bold 
murder conspiracies.  This is how it is done.  Back in the fifties movie 
companies tried to do subliminal suggestions in movies.  They would put a few 
images on a few frames hoping that it would make the audience feel a certain 
way.  People got outraged and the practice "ended."  However, what was not 
noticed by many was that a very small percentage of viewers had interestingly 
strong reactions to the subliminal messages.  In a group of 100,000 maybe two 
or three would react to the suggestion.  One subject bought Coca Cola everytime 
it rained.  He would become almost frantic until the purchase was made.  So the 
government found out that a very few people will do exactly what the subliminal 
messages tell them to do.  Then the government went into business.  When they 
need something done, like a murder, or an "accident" all they have to do is put 
the right message where they want it.  The gov is not that dumb so they put the 
message in the right place.  If they want the murdered caught they show it on a 
movie or a TV show that looney's watch (like public access shows).  They put 
the messages on for a set amount of time and wait for the reactions to kick in. 
 Sometimes this has results they don't expect.  Sometimes wives and lovers get 
killed by mistake.  For special assignments the gov likes to use corporate 
training films.  If your company makes you go to some training thing and during 
that training thing you have to watch a video, it is probably a certainty that 
there is a message in that video.  Look at all the people the have done 
interesting things like Hinckley, and  McVeigh.  Now look at their resume and 
see that they worked for a company with the word "General" in its title.  This 
is not a coincidence.  The gov has gotten better at this project.  They know 
how to be precise (they want to make sure the right person gets killed) and 
they also know how to give the "subjects" the freedom to devise their "own" 
plan.  Sometimes the gov gets sloppy and shows themselves.  Remember when all 
those kids started having seizures after watching a cartoon with a strobe 
effect.  The gov was trying a new method and it didn't work the way they 
wanted, but they did note a few exceptional cases, that required more study.  
The gov has not tried to profile the recipients so that they can pick them out 
of a crowd.  The gov is just relying on numbers and they know that all they 
have to do show the messages and it will strike a chord with someone.  There 
are some in the gov that think the project is having unforseen outcomes.  A 
couple of gov guys have found that some of our radical leaders are actually 
message receivers that didn't get the whole message for some reason.  The gov 
has gotten so good at this, that if you were to do a frame by frame analysis 
unless you knew what you were looking for, you would not see the message.  Once 
someone tells you how to see the message it is easy to see, but they are good 
at hiding the message because they only want one or two people to get the 
message.  Killing of key biologists is what this project was designed to do.  
No problem.
