So, lets assume you are right about it all being a big plan to say 'It's
OK to be gay'. Are you trying to say that having an HiV+ character on
Sesame Street, will turn great swathes of the american public into
homosexuals? Not that there's anything wrong with being gay, and HiV+
isn't a gay only disease, but the idea that by hiding homosexuality from
children you can somehow stop them from developing into a gay adult, is
simply laughable.

Hey EQ, this is the type of uninformed, bigotted 'parent' you want to
entrust the nation's children to ):o)
