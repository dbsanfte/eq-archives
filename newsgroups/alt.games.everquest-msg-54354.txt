I am aware that song, item, and spell Haste all stack. I am aware that it is
not either this, or that... they all stack. With Swift Like the Wind, I
easily out-aggro my fellow melees (still pressing Taunt, of course), I
believe it's quite obvious that the AC from my belt is suddenly more
important than the extra Haste compounded with a FBSS.

Note, however, that I am a SK, so things are a bit different, but still
similar. Now don't misunderstand, if I had a FBSS in my bank, I bet I could
use a use for it occasionally, but not enough to justify buying it since the
amount of Haste is adds is negligible to the Haste a friendly Enchanter can
provide for my slashing joy.

Under certain circumstances, some methods work, some don't - hence the
spontaneity of the game. Under certain circumstances, the Enchanter can keep
good control of things. However, that sometimes fails, so when the Enchanter
becomes the mob's favourite chew toy, I find it better to taunt off the
Enchanter, and return to the original assist - once again, that lovely bit
of AC I have saved up becomes more important than swinging faster. Cheap
shots on me are allowable, but on the Enchanter or Cleric the rest of the
group can follow. <Shrugs>

Since even Warriors get phased while being beaten on by several mobs, once
again, I like to balance the pain.
