Hello all,

     My question pertains to saving a second chat window.  I set up a second
chat for tells and group text.  I'm hitting the apply button after I make my
changes, but every time I log off, it seems to erase my settings. I log back
on with the second chat window still there, but set at the default settings
(all text, all messages, etc.)

A friend of mine tells me that he never has to redo his chat settings, so
what am I doing that causes my settings not to save when I log?

Thanks,

Ching
