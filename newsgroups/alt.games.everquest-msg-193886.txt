If there was a way for characters to add content to the FV server then it
would be a big improvement.  If the FV server got the same level of
attention from the GMs that the legends server gets and players could
actually affect the storyline of the server then I would make the effort to
play on it.  Unfortunately, the content of the FV server is just like the
others except there are more restrictions.  This only servers to illustrate
what EQ lacks, players actually affecting the evolution of the world.
