    That's the thing. A lot of shamans don't see this as improving over
Torpor. Considering that the size of the heal and the speed restrict its use
to XP groups, they may have a point. Unlike the EE vs. WoR debate elsewhere,
there is a strong availability issue with Torpor, and Torpor isn't available
until level 60 vs. 54 for the new heal. But the shamans over on The Crucible
don't seem very happy with this. I gather that they'd like something more
like the Ethereal Light spell clerics got, if they're going to get a new
healing spell.
