Oh dang, let me run to the bank and get my teeny tiny violin, I can
play my "My heart bleeds for you". I am not a bard, but I play one on
USENET.

So, you go to the entire world and shout you are forming a guild. Gee
thanks. BTW folks, I am selling spiderling silks, 3pp each. Get the
point? Maybe? A little?

Okay. I check your headers, and you don't have the same IP. I am not
impressed. The tactic he used to fill his guild are familiar to anyone
who visited Faydark before Luclin, Visited the Nexus before the Bazaar
opened, and the Bazaar before PoK opened.

Use use of peeps is a give away. You can't type P-E-O-P-L-E? You have
to use a term reserved for Eastertide candy? Does it sould cool? It
sounds stupid to me.

The 10+ level invite. I can level in one day to 10. Thats dedication,
but I am not a levelist. I don't care about that, but when making a
pitch for member it makes you sound desparate, despite the exclusive
application grift. Saying we don't take everyone usually means you
take anyone who doesn't give you an open reason for refusal.

How about a post that smelled like cheese. That works on usenet.

I group with people. I meet people. I say lets form a guild. I don't
shotgun the whole USENET community, and then persist in the delusion
that anyone criticises them is being too mean. It strikes a nerve with
me, obviosly.

Yeah group with them. You are sounding like an alt of Avala(whatever
cause he keeps changing his post handle)

Okay I will cut him slack. Maybe he should start a usenet group for
Povar if he is so well liked. Maybe he will get a better reception
begging for membership there!
