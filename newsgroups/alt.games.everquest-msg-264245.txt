If you go into the section entitled "program control", then click the tab 
programs, you can manually add games to the allowed list. Just point the 
program towards your eq folder and add in eqgame.exe and EverQuest.exe   My 
version of zonealarm is ZoneAlarm Pro version 5.1.033.000 and it will also 
let me right click the entry for eq and allow it to "change frequently"
