Well, they had better make it work well at 512MB, because for many
people, upgrading past 512MB will be very hard.  Many motherboards
that use DDR RAM, for example, only have two slots.  512 MB and 1024
MB DIMMs are very expensive (e.g., way more than 2x and 4x the 256 MB
ones), so 512 MB is the practical limit for many people at this
moment.  (Presumably, 512 MB will drop to ~2x 256 MB at some point,
and then 1 GB becomes the practical limit).
