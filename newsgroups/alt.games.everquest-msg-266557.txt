I saw CandleTear on Tarrew marr announcing an incomming mob and when he had the mob targeted the mobs name in the
message was as if it were a Link to an Item.... How can I do this or change the color of the Text in the command line
interface?

I understand that I have to edit the Socials in the .ini file..... but from there I get a little lost.
