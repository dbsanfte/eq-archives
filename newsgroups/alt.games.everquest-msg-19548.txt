> The review is worthless and the reviewer is a drooling fuckwit.

mate, I think you missed the fact www.somethingawful.com is not a serious
site, I guess its a satire site that is not meant to be taken seriously. Its
like the "Charlie Angels" of the game reviews sites, not meant to taken
seriously but a lot of fun and a laugh - well I thought so, but beauty is
int he eye of the beholder. what ever you do, dont read "Ask JeffK" you will
self combust.
