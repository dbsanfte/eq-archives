That, in and as of itself does not make it more mana efficient.  If I can
nuke a mob to death with a few nukes, then sit and med in safety without
worrying about when that root is going to break, I find that much better.
Of course, I don't have snare, so that does color my opinion some.
Personally, I do use root and rot on some mobs, and I use kiting on others,
depends on what my experience has been with root/enstill holding on the mob
in question.
