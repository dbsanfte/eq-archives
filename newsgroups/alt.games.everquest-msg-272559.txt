Required a Knight?  Can't think of one, but I can think of 2 right offhand
where a Knight was just way way more useful than a Warrior.  Aary in NToV
and the annoying Zek in Tactics that arrowed folks and shadowstepped.
Come to think of it there is a 3rd someplace in OOW where the mob in question
has the annoying habit of either casting or proccing a memblur on itself.

SKs and PALs just rule in those cases.
