So I'm thinking most of you are not really thinking this through and
are just on the "I hate SOE" kool-aid.

It's still the same people that brought us EQ, in it's original and
brilliant form.

It's still the same people who wanted to do their own thing and make a
game that they would be proud of, even if it meant slipping ship dates
until they felt it was ready.

It's still the same people who want to make video games, not worry
about marketing and packaging and distribution and everything else
that goes along with selling the game.

If you thought Vanguard was going to be the cat's meow before, why
think differently now just because the distributor is changing?  And
mind you, read carefully because that IS all that's different.
