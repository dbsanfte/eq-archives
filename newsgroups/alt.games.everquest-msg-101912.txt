You guys are halarious!

Yes I 2 box, one pc with a 59 pali, one with a 58 monk. And yes they make an
excellent team since one can heal and tank and the other can dps like a
mofo. Sometimes I even 3 box with a druid. Haha, 2 mice, 2 keyboards, 2
monitors. I get board now if im only playing 1 character.
