Am I the only one who is sick of hearing that "EQ doesnt really begin until
45/50"!
I think maybe my PC is bugged, cos I started playing at level 1.
I have tried petitioning, but I have never got a satisfactory reply.
It does help that Verant has supplied lots of adventuring space for us poor
peeps, who have to start at level 1.
The other day I went to a dungeon called Crystal Caverns. Man, I think all
the peeps who have to start at level 45/50 are missing out on something, cos
I had a great laugh with a few of my guildies. We even managed to find some
mobs that conned BLUE to us!!!

Seriously, if you wanna accept that the game starts at 50..fine...but some
players want to play the game as it was intended,  i.e. getting a group of
chars around you own level together to take out big mobs in a dungeon for
some nice items, and not just sitting in LOIO from 20-30, OT from 30-40 and
DL from 40-50 at which point, you can start to "play" the game.

Address any flames to me
