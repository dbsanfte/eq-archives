Hmmm I really didn't think anyone was stupid enough to answer that.  
After all it was specifically addressed to adolescents.  Only those 
that consider themselves to fit that description need be offended by 
it.  Are you saying you are an adolescent (chronologically or 
mentally) and are offended that no one cares?  Or are you just 
championing the cause of immaturity in general?

As for "taking something as "serious" <sic> as a video game 
newsgroup", I'm not sure to whom you are directing that or what 
exactly you mean.  Is it in reference to my comment to Dan, shedding 
light on why I had been absent for quite awhile?  I suppose I could 
see how someone would consider it "taking things seriously" to stop 
reading a usenet group that no longer seems to contain much discussion 
on the topic.  

As for this little "Go away!" war.  Sorry I'm not biting.  Feel free 
to park here and discuss whatever your heart desires.  Its a free 
country.  I'll reserve the right to walk away again when I'm bored 
enough.  Trust me I won't lose any sleep over how pathetic that might 
be.  I started embracing my "pathetic"ness when I turned 30.

Have a nice day! Nuthin' but love for ya. :-)
