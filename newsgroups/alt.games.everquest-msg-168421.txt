Actually a better place is any tradeskill container. Find a wheel,
forge, brew barrel or loom. No bags though, but hey, the things are
not likely to get picked up.

Good choices are all the Third Gate Neriak ones, except the forge. I
like the Halas ones for goods. In NFP by the bank there is a wheel
nearby that is hidden and is good. One that I never see used is the
loom way up in Kelethin.

Bad choices are any tradeskill place in Thug, the forges and barrels
in WFP and probably the good ones I mentioned above, now that I
mentioned them...
