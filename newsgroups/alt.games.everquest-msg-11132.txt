I have this Eyeball, Moggock's Right Eye.
I recieved it instead of the broken fishing pole one day, in East Freeport
at the fishermans rest, from the Barb babe that hangs with the ogre.
I haven't a clue as to what to do with this.  Can't find a related quest
anywere in the local area.  Maybe in Grob?  Netulos?  Oh well.  Hope
somebody knows a little bit more than me on the matter.
It is Lore/Nodrop too by the way.
