A single necro with no SOW, CLARITY or other gimmicks can fear kite
for hours with little or no problems.

In the outdoors a necro finds the least traveled path camps his pet
and pulls back to that spot, which is what a group of necros would
doo.  But now they have SOW and they never worry about making sure
darkness sticks.   

A stragler would be a BLESSING to a group of necros.  That would mean
they do not have to go find another.  Depending on the health of the
mob 2~4 necros would say pet back off and send to the stragler then
darkness (snare) and fear.  Plus there is the MEZ spell that necros
have but never use.  The necro has sooooo may spells it is not funny.
The necro can escape from danger more ways than any other character.

A druid is the only thing the group needs.  Regen, Sow and track.  No
debuffs, no clarity, no heals, no nukes.  With SOW you do even need to
Fear kite.

Hell they don't really need the Druid.  Replace him with a mage to
make weapons and march across the zone like the Goons in OT
