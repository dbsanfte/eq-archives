Not true.  I routinely run out of range of a nuke before it hits (which then
doesn't hit at all).  I even use this at times to get single pulls quickly. 
Unless chromas' spells are unlimited range, they should work the same way.

It's a common spell to have necros cast on you while pulling.  I can count
the number of times I've resisted it on one hand.  In other words, unless
you can self-buff to 300+ MR/FR it's not worth trying to resist.
