DoN is a lot like LDON and most people liked it but it isnt quite as
popular as it used to be.  You can trade your "adventure points" as
they have evolved in to tradeable crystals.  You will see these for
sale in the bazaar under "Ebon Crystal" and "Radiant Crystal".  The
gear it can buy is reasonable enough.  At level 70 you can get around
150 mana/HP on every piece of gear with enough money.  (Buying the gear
and the augment).  Melee can 1h buy weapons with a near-even ratio.
You can buy an augment for all of the basic focus effects such as mana
pres V, ID V, etc.. as well as haste augments, shielding augments,
spell shield augments, and other effects that were once very difficult
to get.  You get two spells from the expansion, some classes' spells
are useful, others' are not.  There are raids for people who do that
scene.

DodH was a great expansion in my opinion.  It focused a lot on
instanced missions.  Aside from being instanced they aren't much like
LDON adventures.  The zones vary and there isn't that much crawling to
do.  Many required good strategy on pulls as well as a well-functioning
group.  It is hard.  The mobs hit hard.  But the rewards are certainly
there.  (200hp/mana gear, advanced focus effects, spell runes for OoW
spells, etc..)  A lot of already-well-equipped players got upgrades on
single-group content and it seems there was something for everyone in
this expansion.  Necros have a few great options for kiting with very
good experience.  (Sorry though, not many summoned mobs.)  The spells,
though tough to obtain for some, were generally good spells.  This
expansion also added monster missions.  Though not nearly as popular as
they once were, this is a nice option for people of different levels to
group together.  (Level doesn't matter, you are transformed in to a
set-level monster once you zone in)  We also saw the first evolving
items (the item levels up as you XP) and intelligent items (evolves and
also talks to you).  Finally this gives you the ability to shroud to a
different class.  Although the class you become is exceedingly
under-powered (clerics heal for like 3k?...warriors tank about as well
as bards) you can also use this to change level and join your friends
in any level-appropriate zone.  I did find this useful when we couldn't
find a slower/enchanter and just had to have one.

PoR I have not done that much with but it seems to continue the DodH
tradition of providing non-raiders a chance for good experience and
real gear upgrades.

You can have a lot of fun with the last 3 expansions then, IMO.  They
are the polar opposite of PoP and GoD, which kicked non-raiders in the
crotch over and over it seemed.

Don't know about FV but that might be a problem.  Low end zones are, as
you might expect, quite dead.  But that is nothing new.

We are told.

Hmmm, not that I know of.  Probably 55+.

I think you are still going to be visiting Paludal if you want to
group, sorry.
