OK, here's my major Bitch about groups.
You get to zone..do your /shout 45 blah LFG about 10 times ( if your
Lucky) get a group fight, kill player loots: You get blah for your
split. Then someone else loots and doesn't have split on.
Now I know some groups say FFA looting but hey, it's a group, everyone
is doing their  jobs i.e. Casters casting, healer Healing and melee,
well, melleing. As a courtesy to the group I ALWAYS have split on so
that caster, healer get their share for keeping my ass alive. I just
don't understand these asshole who refuse to have split on.
Not to be a dick but in my exp. the French seem to be the major
abusers of not having split on, and even after giving a polite"Split
Please" still no split on. Grrr.

Oh yeah one more grip, I just love the asshole's that sit back then
run up and loot before the fucken thing even hits the ground. It's
like shit, where you swing that axe or right clicking your fucken
mouse during fight.

Aaaarrfff
