This is old data (pre-Velious), but this is what a table made from
ShowEQ logs that is widely available on the web shows:

They are indeed called "a brownie scout", and range from level 1 to 3,
and have from 11 to 61 hitpoints.  Their race is "brownie" and their
class is druid.  Known spawn points are (1270,2197) and (-1425,1208).

Note that the spawn point list may be incomplete.  I believe that this
data was compiled by having someone simply stand around in the zone for
a few hours, and then they looked at the logs.  Note also that some data
I've seen from ShowEQ has X and Y reversed relative to the EQ coordinate
system.

Nillipuss, level 15 brownie ranger, 615 hitpoints.  Spawn (38,-73).
