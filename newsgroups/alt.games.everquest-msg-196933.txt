You met an Asshole of EQ (tm).  Unfortunately you will meet others -
they breed.

Technically there are no camps in EQ (except for very high level
content).
You could have continued there and there would be nothing the other
guy could do about it.
  
Since the guy was guilded, you can send a complaint to one of their
officers.
Some guilds, if they get enough complaints about someone, will kick
them out.
However, some guilds don't care either so it might not be worth
bothering with.
