As an aside, I found out why it's called "quadding", not "quinting".  I
attempted to "quad" five mobs and was lucky to kill one before I had to run
to the boat gnome.

Found a guide on TDG which recommended Spirocs in Timorous Deep.  They were
a good choice - slow runners, dark blue to my druid, etc.

I drew aggro by snaring.  You last point was quite apropos; I found that,
overall, the method of just standing still until all four mobs are beating
on you is not the ideal method for packing the mobs together.

My druid is not at all twinked - or, at least, not seriously twinked - and
not only did he burn through all his mana in one quad, he had to keep
running and medding until he could get two more finishing nukes off.

I also used Spirit Ash to med for the first time.  Spirit Ash turns you into
a tree and increases your hit point and mana regeneration (according to EQ
Casters' Realm, anyway).  So I cast Spirit Ash and tabbed over to Monual to
continue my faction quest in Riwwi, then half an hour later tabbed back to
find Rudnom at 50m!  Turns out that trees do, in fact, have to sit to regain
mana.  Who knew.  =/

<snip explanation of charm-kiting and aggro-kiting>

Thanks, that was very helpful.

Very much so.  I always feel mildly panicked when my mana drops below two
bubbles.  Quad-kiting had me on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  =)

When all was said and done, I found that power-leveling was still much
faster.  As tedious as pin-cushioning can be, with Monual doing most of the
casting (and with his uber mana regen) I could keep up a constant stream of
mobs and just never stop killing.  In the time it took Rudnom to do one
quad-kite, I could have killed a dozen mobs in LGuk.

Quad-kiting was fun to try - I'm always on the lookout for a new
experience - but for the immediate future, it's not going to be a useful
tool for me.  If and when Rudnom gets to the mid-50's and Monual's
effectiveness at power-leveling diminishes, I'll revisit the technique.

And if I ever get him to 65, I can use Rudnom to power-level Monual.  =)

Thanks again Lief.
