For INT casters (wiz mage necro ench), not all their spells at levels
16+ are available on vendors, they have to be researched. These Words
are components for that research. Some Words are for mage spells, some
are for necro spells. Wizard spells need Runes, and Enchanter spells
need numbered Pages. http://mythiran.allakhazam.com for all your
research needs =)

> 2)  Do more expensive foods/drinks last longer?  Are they worth it?

When you inspect a food/drink item (by right-click-and-hold ing on it)
you will see a description such as 'This is a snack', 'This is a hearty
meal' etc. These indicate how long, in relative terms, the items will
last. The exact figures are <mumble>. Bread + water makes perfectly good
sustenance. Be aware that 'Chunk of Meat' (but NOT 'named' meats such as
lion, rat etc) is a 'meal'!

Depending on your server, some/many/most/nearly all of the people your
level you meet will actually be the second (or later) character of an
established player, who will have given their new character equipment
and funds to help them start. This is called twinking, and even my
mentioning it I am dangerously close to starting a flame war, so I'll
leave it at that.

As for getting money yourself: collect Low/Medium/High Quality pelts
from the cats and bears in EC. Watch for people /auctioning to buy them.
Depending on your server, HQ bear will sell for anything from 20 to 35
PLAT each, other quality pelts from 1-3pp each. Though as a necro you
need bone chips, it can be worth selling a stack or two to other
players - look for 1pp-5pp per stack.

DE Necros are generally hated, yes... something to do with raising the
dead and worshipping the Prince of Hate, can't work it out myself =) I
generally play goody-goodies so I can't help you out with faction
issues, sorry.
