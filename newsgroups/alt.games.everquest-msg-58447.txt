Gets better with drones as you guessed, I found that rooting & dotting didnt
work well 'for me' until 34, then it starting paying off, but afore that...
yup, I would just nuke the em.

Immolate sat in my spell book barely touched until I got the debuffer, Ro's
Feiry sundering at 39, as before that it seemed to land maybe 1 in 3
attempts...not good : (
