I've seen alot of debate on guild and a couple raid chats about /q clearing
agro or not...

We were trying to break Fear not to long ago and some how the group at the
gate kept getting trained... There was a Monk and a Sk at the first camp
site FD... they repeatedly /q out... and logged back in saying that '/q
removes you from game active state and thus removes you from agro' yet a
guide to somewhere (can't remember) told me that /q doesn't remove agro so
if you can't camp, die peacefully... was a LONG cr that involved help from
one of the servers Higher guilds to finally get broken in and get rezzes..

just wanting to know what experiences ppl have had with this so that next
time I can say with more authority that /q does or doesn't remove agro

Thank ye and Peace
