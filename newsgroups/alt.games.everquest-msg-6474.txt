The damage cap, for warriors at least, is 20 until level 10, and then 30
until level 20, this includes kick/bash/slam but not critical/crippling
hits.  The cap is on both 1H and 2H weapons, just that 2Hers hit the cap
more than 1H because of the higher damage, regardless of delay.
Due to the cap, it is more efficient to use 2 low damage low delay weapons
rather than 1 high damage high delay (statistically the low damage low delay
is better too, if you miss, it isn't as important;  I still want myself a
Mithril 2-hander!)

I know that int-casters never lose their damage cap on melee though I'm not
sure about wis-casters
