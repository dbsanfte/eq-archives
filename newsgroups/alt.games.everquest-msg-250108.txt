While I don't see the harm in it, why on earth would you need to?

You should be smacked with a large trout. Good lord, woman. We have 
mages to CoH people to them one at a time and that's already used to 
shortcut a ton of content. Your suggestion would leave us wizards parked 
in horrid areas just to summon groups up. Yikes. Talk about potential 
for abuse and more crap that the wizards and druids don't need to be doing.

I can see giving a bone to the soloers. Why not? Doesn't sound 
unbalancing, though not all that fun either.
