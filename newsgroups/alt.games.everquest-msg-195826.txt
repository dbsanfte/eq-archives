You have BoBC?  I hate you - got on one Velk raid, and they 
didn't drop.  Staff is only 13.5 secs but it's a bolt - not
good for raids.  I'm really lucky, been playing with my RL 
buddy for a *LONG* time, he really knows how to position a
mob.  From there it's just a matter of making sure folks leave
one side open for my bolts.

Lol, I remember the incredible thrill I felt when I dinged
35.  It was amazing to suddenly be able to *SEE* during fights.

And don't get me wrong, I love C3 - It does after all stack
with pet canni.  It's just that I can make do without - I 
just have to be more on the ball.

One time on a PoI crawl I had PoTG, SP and KEI on. 
Sitting on my horse I felt like I couldn't run out of mana.
Never even considered pet canni during that run.
