Um, you don't get a chance at whatever form this supposed "reward"
takes because you haven't wasted hours and hours trying to get through
a flagging system that you could have spent levelling, gaining aa
abilities, working tradeskills, or just enjoying the game in some
other way.  And lets not forget, I *did* admit I was whining in the
end. =P

Don't really want it both ways.  Or at least I don't see it that way,
we may be doomed to disagree on that point.  What I think is that it
should have been fairly obvious from that start that putting players
through that kind of bullshit to access content that they paid for was
a *bit* of a misstep, to say the list, and needed a fix within a
couple weeks of the expansion going live, NOT over half year later.
And when the fix does come, is it a modification?  Did they maybe
implement a quest that although challenging, a single player could
manage and earn his way into these zones, and get a sense of
accomplishment?  No.  They did what Sony has always done and moved the
slider bar too far in the opposite direction.  They took a flagging
system that was a frustrating time sink that took away the enjoyment
of the game for many people, and removed it completely.  The easy way
out.  Rather than implement a creative solution that might keep people
that have been there and done that from feeling they were righteously
fucked up the ass, they said "Fuck this, lets just remove the flag
system altogether.".  I just feel this was the lazy man's way out.
