It sure did. I quit my cleric during the Velious era when I got tired
of sitting around zones twiddling my thumbs LFG. And travel pre-Luclin
(pre-PoP, really) without ports/SoW was too much of a pain in the ass.
So I went to Test and started a druid.

Brought cleric back three months ago after a RL friend on my old server
joined a new guild and raved about it. It's a totally different game now.
Playing a cleric in the 50s is fun again.
