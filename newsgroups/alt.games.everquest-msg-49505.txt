I'm considering the shackles quests for my Iksar monk. Are they really worth
it? I see to do the shackles of clay you have to get froglok skipping stones
which are either hard to find, or you had to get lucky and someone sold them
to a merchant (by the way, which merchant? In Cabalis or Swamp of no hope?).
Then if you want both the shackles of clay and stone, you need to do the
clay quest again after the stone quest (so you end up needing 2 of each
item).  Are they really worth it?  Or do some people on Allakhazam's web
site just over react with items being hard to find? It seams many people who
responded to that quest say that some of the items are hard to find.

What about any other good monk quests too? I've already done the curescale
armor quest to get the pieces of it so that one is now finished.
