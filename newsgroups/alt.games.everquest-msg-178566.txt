Roger Chaffe.  Ed White.  Grissom did the first space-walk on Gemini 8,
if I'm not mistaken. I was really into the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo 
programs as a kid, and Alzheimers hasn't set in just yet :)

Meanwhile, it's been almost 30 years since a man has been on the moon. 
I remember predictions that by now we'd have a triving moon colony 
actually producing valuable raw materials for use on Earth and missions
to Mars and other planets.  How sad that we dropped the ball.
