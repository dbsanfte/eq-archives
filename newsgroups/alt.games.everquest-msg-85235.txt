> Is there any particular use to having the spell Identify?

  Some will say "no", others will say "yes."  It can help you identify
whether or not an item is for a quest, and perhaps help you get some
history behind it, but generally speaking, it won't help you as much
in practical matters as will a trip to a spoiler site.

  So you can get better prices with merchants with a bias towards
dwarven and barbarian characters, and to improve your faction with
some groups so you can complete quests you couldn't in half-elf, human
or gnome-form.

  No idea, haven't researched them.
