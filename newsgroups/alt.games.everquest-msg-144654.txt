I have been freezing/locking up during gameplay ever since the new UI.
Actually, that is not true, it worked fine for about 2 weeks, then it
started freezing on me.  Doesn't matter if I am fighting, medding, running,
etc.   I freeze about once or twice a day.  Here is my system:

ECS K7S5A Motherboard
AMD Athlon XP 1700+
784 MB SDRAM
Western Digital Harddrive
Alienware Case and 350 Watt Powersupply (AMD & Pentium 4 Rated)
NVidia GeForce 4 64MB Video Card

I have tried updating all the drivers (Motherboard, Video Card, On-Board
Sound, AGP, BIOS) and still have no luck.  I have my case open with a house
fan blowing on the motherboard, which seems to help only slightly if at all.
I have tried reseating the CPU, RAM, and Video Card.  I have added a
harddrive fan.  I have upgraded my CPU fan.  Any other thoughts on what to
do with this?
