Keep in mind that after solo a character up to high levels your gonna

A) get bored and want to try another class, and
B) find some good items that your class cant use and
   want to give them to an alternate character (called twinking)

So the desire for better items comes into play...........

So a druid (good soloer) can port all over the place and charge people
around 10pp or more for a ride. Ive make over 1K a day doing so even
with only the
first round of port spells. Druids can make a lot of money then use
the money
to buy the items they want.

The best items are found in dungeons.

Druids suck at dungeon soloing.

Necros are a LOT better at dungeon soloing (but cant use fear cause of
pathing
and mobs running around and getting adds.) So necros have an edge when
it comes
to item farming in dungeons. Necros also find it hard to get in a
group.

Druids are often more desired in groups than necros but druids are a
dime a dozen so it can be hard getting groups as well.

Outdoors both druids and necros can solo way up there.

That leaves us with monk who are desired in a group as a damage dealer
and puller, can solo well (from what ive heard....im only 5th right
now) and can function well in dungeons.

Also, the best items are found in the hardest places which REQUIRE
groups to be able to level in. A cleric, ogre warrior or enchanter has
free reign in which high level zones to find a group in and try to
obtain some of the good stuff to twink their low level alts with.

hopes this adds some light on the issue.
