    Everyone starts at the bottom. One of my guildmates recently
complemented me on my look, telling me that when I joined the guild my gear
was so mismatched that it was obvious that I'd selected it for the comedic
look. I hadn't. She was really horrified when she learned that they'd tagged
a level 60 Baroness cleric with all resists below 100, no real resist gear,
and a WIS of 183 WITH the five AA points in WIS included. I've gotten better
since then. :-)

    That was close to my first assessment looking at the Magelo you listed.
Weak on MANA/HPs/resists, but it's not like you're raiding with this guy
(that's where those matter most). And given that we had a current guildmate
wizard go from 49 to 60 in a month on raptors, the XP part of things should
be fine. Some ideas on cheap improvements:

Hat: a weak spot. Runed Circlet from Perma is cheap and a minimal upgrade
(AC 4 INT/WIS 4), Nightshade Wreath from the Maid in Mistmoore is a better
upgrade (AC 1 INT/WIS 5), and the Platinum Tiara from the Froglok Tactician
in Lower Guk would be a nice XP camp for Jakugg and friends (AC 3 HP 35 MANA
50). There's also the Runed Cowl in Lower Guk, but that is usually camped by
the FBSS camp these days.

Neck: I'm more of a Black Sapphire Platinum necklace person myself (55
HP/MANA), but I can see STR might be an issue and you get the same mana from
what you have now. As you get better gear and more INT, though, you'll want
to make the switch.

Face: go get your Acumen Mask. I think you'll still be able to get XP off
some of the mobs. When camping the Shadowed Men for the last part, you can
help a certain special necromancer do any of her Temple of Sol Ro quests
that she'd like to do.

Finger: that INT ring has got to go. Ring of Frost (INT 3 MANA 10) drops
randomly and often off Dervishes in EW/IC. Another Moonstone Ring would be
nice. If you want to buy something nice, the Ring of the Frost Spiders from
Velk's (AC 5 INT/WIS 2 HP/MANA 25 PR 10) is usually sold quite cheaply,
being considered something of a junk loot.

    The Seal from that quest is really nice. The shawls are worth doing just
to get that.

    If you want a quick raid that'll help you immensely, then this is the
quest for you:

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=931

    You do a bunch of running around, and only have to fight (assuming Invis
stays up for the running around) the one final fight. The reward will be
used by you until you get your epic at least:

Phenocryst's Focus: AC 5 DEX 3 INT 10 CHA 3 MR 5 FR/CR/PR/DR 3 MANA 40.
Either hand.

    Once you're done with the quest, the people that stay can slaughter
geonids for good XP, great cash drops, and the odd Unrefined Gem which you
need for your eighth shawl. ;-)
