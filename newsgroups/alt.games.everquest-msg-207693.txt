I carry a collapsed toolbox, collapsed potion bag, collapsed bearskin 
bag, collapsed tacklebox, collapses sewing kit, collapsed mortar and 
pestle, collapsed spit, all in one WR bag, and uncollapse whichever one I

are.

I have never looked into any of the magnifying objects really, so no clue 
on that.
