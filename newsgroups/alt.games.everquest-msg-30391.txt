On the other hand, at 57 I *rarely* get a request for mod rods. I'll usually
dump a ton on the ground for the cleric when I'm waiting for a res, but even
then they dont use them half the time. Personally, I'd never use more then 1
mod rod, that'd take out 25% of my life. If I'm in a raid thats gone bad,
the last thing I'm going to want to do is lose 25% of my life for half a
bubble of mana... They're just not worth it. They're pretty much only cleric
food in my opinion, thats the only class that's ever wanted one. Well,
except warriors trying to be funny. :)

In any case, it bugs me when mod rods are referred to as mana regeneration
items. They might give you a little mana, but the cost is too high, making
them pretty useless in my opinion. I'm better off sitting for 30 seconds.
