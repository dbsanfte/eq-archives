I played a wizard to 24 on FV, and while I deleted the character
because I found the wizard class not for me, I found it very easy
to fit into a group correctly.

Assist MT (always always always).  Wait until the mob is down to
75% health.  Stand, cast best nuke, sit.  Wait until the mob is
down to 25% health.  Stand, cast best nuke, sit.

I almost never got aggro, did a hell of a lot of damage, and made
the mob skip that mode where they do a lot of damage when their
health is 25% and lower, which kept us pulling at a faster rate.

I never did master AoE spells, though.  No matter how I timed it,
I always seemed to get aggro from the mobs nobody had engaged.
