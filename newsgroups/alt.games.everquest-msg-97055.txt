So you missed the posts that implied it was most likely
changed due to breaking (or stretching) the popular
culture and/or 'period setting' rules, then?   They'll come
along to your ISP in a bit, most likely.

At any rate, what a GM does is irrelevant.  There's NO rule
against having a first and last name that combine into a
single word, as long as that word doesn't violate the naming
guidelines itself.   In other words, the rule is:  "You can't use
the combination of first and last names to get around the
naming guidelines."

You're not going to argue that the fact that a GM can change
a name if they'd like makes all names they change automatically
against the rules, are you?   Because that would certainly imply
that any name they do NOT change is valid (if they see the
character, at least) and we all know that's not the case.
