Monkly Business used to be the most respected monk site.   However, as I
understand it, the board's previous owner then sold ownership of the board
to Yantis, the festering boil on the ass of Everquest.  The majority of the
knowledgable and respected posters left and formed a new board.   A scene
that has since been repeated on sevreal other class message boards and EQ
related sites.
