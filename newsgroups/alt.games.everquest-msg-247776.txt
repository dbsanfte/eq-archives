.... just to confuse the issue further <g>, I'm of the opinion that at
least 2 of the mammoths are instant respawns in Everfrost. I spent
about 2 levels up there fear kiting them with a ranger and I'd almost
always see one pop up on track as soon as I killed one. The times I
didn't, I wrote it off to him respawning out of tracking range.
