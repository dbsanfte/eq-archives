Outside the bat and rat rooms there are taelosians that will ask you to kill
the room, but I heard that no reward is implemented.  As a 65 I went in
there and by tracklist about 1/3 were white and the rest dark blue.  I heard
it is scaled by your level.  I cast bard lull on one L65 golem and it stuck
first try, so guessing that lulls will resist normally and not like ldon
hard.  The boxing giant golems are permarooted, summon, and are not assisted
by their 'controllers'.  I heard there is no good loot, but that was from
someone that was just killing bats.
