Exactly.

Good choice of words.

EQ1 is not well balanced, and its not terribly good at variety. EQ2 
appears to have balance, but at the cost of any meaninful variety.

There is another way of doing things. Meaninful variety, and still 
balanced. EQ1 has good examples of meaninful variety, but its focussed 
on only a few of the classes, and often in trivial activities (e.g. 
opening a door, or porting to the zone) but the -idea- those 
requirements represent is a 'good idea'.
