   I'm not in any serious guilds, but my RL friend
Shawn, who introduced me to EQ, is.  I don't know
the name of his guild, but I do know that he plays
on the 7th hammer.  
    Anyways, he was over at my house playing when
he had to go to an on-line guild meeting. There
was alot of bad feelings going around.  A member of 
the guild had demanded that everyone who was on at
the time of the incident stop what they were doing
and come help him PL his cleric wife.  He became 
VERY bitter when not everyone complied.  The reason?
His wife was on the verge of leaving him because
of his EQ habit, and he reasoned that if she were
in command of an uber, high-demand character she
would be more inclined to join him in his obsession,
rather than forcing him to take some responsibility
for his actions and life.
   This guy wasn't just accusing people of not
honoring guild loyalties, but of trying to 
break up his marriage.  How's THAT for craaazy
drama?

Annie <--- Wishes her husband would play more often.
