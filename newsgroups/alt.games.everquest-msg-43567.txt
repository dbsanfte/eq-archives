Damn, would be such a shame to lose FoH.
(do I need to add an emoticon to signify my sarcasm? No, I don't think I do
in this case)

Personally I will be trying DAoC, my interest in EQ has been one the wane
for some time. Many of my friends have already quit, which doesn't actually
help the situation much. I don't intend to quit EQ, I want to see Luclin, I
want to maybe make 50 (altho this is a longshot) and finally be able to proc
my sword (while still logged into the game, I can proc it fine when I go LD)

If (big IF, I have a few reservations about DAoC, not so much on not being
as good or even better than EQ but more that my EQ burnout is not anything
to do with the game but the genre) DAoC does become a replacement to EQ what
I do with my account is going to be another dilemma. Do I just cancel and
leave it, do I give my equipment to guildies (assuming there are any left)
or do I sit in a newbie zones (as one quitting EQ player did) and give out
quests to earn his equipment...I will NOT be selling it, you may try to tell
me that I don't own it, well AFAIAC I own that name and rep. No Ebayer is
going to have it.
