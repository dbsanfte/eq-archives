I've seen is going in low hundreds. Oak seems to sell for about 100-200,
Darkwood is usually shaped and racking in at 400-500 or so (that I have
seen, and admittedly I havent seen many sold). Rough might be a bit
cheaper.

You really need to be at source to do well. Unlike arrows the components
are not stackable and the availability of parts is much lower. THere are
bow component vendors scattered around in fewer places. Gfay will likely
be your best bet for a good enough fletcher around to make and sell you
a bow.
