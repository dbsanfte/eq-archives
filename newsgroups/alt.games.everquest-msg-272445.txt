Not strictly true to my knowledge.  The problem that arises is that you 
will likely still be xping on the same mobs at 70 as you are at 65, and 
thus, you lose the high con bonus.  I can see the difference soloing in 
Fire on the same mobs I soloed at level 65, I now get noticably less xp 
at level 69.  On the other hand, I can kill them somewhat faster too, not 
sure if the difference is a wash or not off hand.
