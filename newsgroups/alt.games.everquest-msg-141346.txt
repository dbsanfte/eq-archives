You forgot to specify the most important part there Ryo, and that is to make
sure it is also the right <sized> catheter tube in diameter.

The only thing scarier than coming out of a short coma to find an obviously
oversized catheter tube hanging out the end of your dick is standing next to
a person at a urinal who has had the above experience...  can you say
"sprinkler"?

*grumbles*

It's embarrassing being a bloke and having to squatt to piss on the toilet
as it is the only way of keeping the piss off the walls let alone the toilet
seat....

*grumbles some more*
