Sure, but that's not what we're talking about, so don't try to
back-pedal. You specifically accused a *druid* of poor raid etiquette
because you think he should stick around and play port monkey for a
bunch of people who are apparently too lazy to make the easy walk out
of Perma.

Yes, I'm aware of that. I'm talking about your accusations regarding
one druid's actions on a raid. What are you talking about?

No, in fact, I'm not.

Specifically, that would be "none". You know how a bunch of Vox
capable people get out of Perma after a raid? They stand up and walk
out.

What happened to "Neither yourself nor myself can say whether it was a
minor or major inconvenience"?
