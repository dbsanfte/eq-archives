Yep - if I die twice in a short space of time, I usually either take
all my raw materials and go crafting, or head to Oakmyst or The Bog
and hunt ?'s and mine tier 1 materials for my alt.

So my skills are never more than 2 levels apart (actually, I've just
got Scholar 16, so I'm now 16/16).

Downside - I have 23 collection quests on the go.          :D

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
