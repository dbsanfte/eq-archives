How quickly they forget... don't you remember the incessant bitching
about LDoN when it came out? It only faded away to be replaced with
massive bitching about GoD. LoY offered nothing interesting that I've

They won't get me with this one. Every time someone at Sony farts,
they charge us $30 and make us download it.
