/sigh
Yes, I typed Alteration instead of Abjuration.  You'll note that my
statement goes from nonsense to sensible with that little correction.
Including the bit about it not lagging significantly unless you're
dedicated to grouping (in which case your 'coat buff is the only
Abjuration spell you're using as a youngster).

It's still a stupid theory idea though:  "Hey, let's force young Rangers
and Druids to cast this spell more often so their Abjuration skill will
go up faster, because they're too stupid to manage their own casting
skills and must be mothered to death by big brother."  Not to say that
the crew silly enough to screw with an incredibly unimportant spell
(after 4 and a half years!!!) couldn't be using such a stupid rationale.
But, frankly, stupid doesn't begin to explore the depths of idiocy such
an idea represents.
