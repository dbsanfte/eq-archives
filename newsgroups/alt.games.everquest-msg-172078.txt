I saw a distressing post about KEI and it freezing out Enchanters
below 30, as well as messing up the chances for a melee to group,
because all those casters are soloing. Yeah, KEI may have to be
nerfed, but who wants to end the party. It is funny Clarity 2 has
minimum level limit, but Clarity 3 has nothing? Not my main point.

I think its from the explosion (IMHO) of Ebayed people, who don't
really play a class besides the one they bought. I never really
understood the power of a rogue until I played one, and didn't
understand the outlook of a wizard until I played one. My 'main' is an
Enchanter, but I wander a lot, and I learn a lot more about what
different Enchanter spells mean to people.

Returning to my main point. Enchanters bring powerful buffs to the
table. Below 30 this is no different. Clarity isn't the only
spellcaster buff. Haste or Aug isn't the only melee buff. They also
have great debuffs, Tash is probably paramount to other casters, Slow
is paramount to melee, and Stuns (ranged and PB) are important to
keeping that healer alive. Finally, crowd control is important, and
not just by mezzing. Charms, stuns and memory wipes are handy to keep
aggro down, and there are spells to make a tank a better taunter.

This makes three main roles for the Enchanter, Buff, Debuff, and Crowd
control. With the new pet rules for mezzing, they are a little less
fragile, sice they can have a pet who will know better than break a
mez. With some minor nukes, they can also catch runners, and the small
dots they get help with DPS for a modest mana cost.
