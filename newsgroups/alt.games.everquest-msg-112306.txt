FTR, on Torv, there are less than a dozen on the entire server. My RL
friend, who is also a guildmate, got his at level 60 a few weeks back
and was the eighth. At least one more SK had done it since then.

The work/reward ratio is not great on the SK epic. It takes several
rare drops, one of which is shared with warriors and one of which can
take multiple raids to the dreaded Plane of Sky. Also, the epic hasn't
kept up with the current slate of better weapons out there. A week
after completing his two-year epic quest, my friend bagged his when he
go a better 1hb weapon from ToV.
