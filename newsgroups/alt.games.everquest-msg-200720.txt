The difference here is the fact that we disagree on whether it should be 
that easy and/or painless to level that high. The easier/quicker you make 
it, the less effort/patience/intestinal fortitude it takes and the less 
of an accomplishment it can be for those who make it. Personally, I like 
to feel like I've done something when I put in the time and effort it 
takes. If every yahoo and their brother are flying straight up to the 
higher levels, it would hardly be anything I'd look forward to.
