Theres instanced zones in ruined city, and I think the trials in MPG are 
instanced.

They dont all connect to DS like POT.
You have to be 69 for riftseekers.

Causeway, WOS, bloodfields and ruined city all have completely safe zone 
ins.
Zone into DS isnt safe.

There isnt anything stopping you from porting out.
Be aware that most of the mobs run at selos speed.

You can run from DS through bloodfields to ruined city, or from DS through 
causeway, through WOS to MPG while invisible without danger. Some mobs see 
invis, but they dont spawn near the main throughway.
