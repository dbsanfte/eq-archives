It wasn't always 15 minutes, I just said "about 15 minutes" because 
thats usually what it was, more or less.  Dain 3, in particular, is 
pretty scripted, I can't imagine what you could do to make it take much 
longer.

Now that you explain the completion time system, thats undoubtedly how 
it worked, people weren't exactly explaining things to me.
