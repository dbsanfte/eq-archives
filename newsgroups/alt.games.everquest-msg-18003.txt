Twinking:
You can't tell other people how to play, but you can avoid self-twinkage if
you want to. I don't really like the concept for a dozen reasons, but it's a
fact of the game. Best thing is to accept it and not let it bother you. The
new server is one character only (so no self-twinking), maybe that'd appeal
to you more.

Shouting:
If shouting (i.e. other people) or ooc'ing bothers you, switch the chat
channel off. It would be nice, too, if people put in-character stuff only on
the shout channel, but not everyone's like you and I. Again, you can't tell
other people to change to suit yourself, and it's easier to accept that and
move on than rail against it.
