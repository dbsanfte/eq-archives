In the context of the section as a whole, it had to do with not
practicing rituals associated with other religions.  You know, group
sex and all that fun stuff that the stuffy old Hebrews weren't allowed
to do on Saturday nights when all the other nation's parents let their
kids do it.  Hebrew parents were the meanest ones on the block and
their kids never got to have any fun.
