It's their scape-goat for an emergency patch I think.  Even their web-site
was down when it happened, and it was up at 8:00 eastern, as I generally
check there before I log on to see network status.  I got booted at roughly
8:20 or so.

At least I saw when I finally DID get on that at least I didn't die to the
hands of the rhino.  WOOT!

Safe travels,
Sean...
