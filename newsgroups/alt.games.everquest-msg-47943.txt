Yes, but what is more useful, someone to can track maybe a quarter of
the zone with no filtering, or someone who can track damned near the
entire zone and filter out what they don't need?

I'm not the type of player that agonizes over group composition.  For
the most part, if you have a group of skilled players, you can make
any combination work.  But there are people who things like this
matter to.

That said, lets say you got a raid going.  You have a 29 people.  You
have a for that last slot you have to pick between a ranger and a
druid?  Who would you pick?  The ranger can bring anything to the
party that a druid can, plus, if he's not concerned with faction
considerably more damage output.  Granted, he will be a bit more of a
load on your healers if he's not careful.  Now, if they were worried
about faction, you might wanna go with the druid because he'd take a
bit of the strain off the healers during down time.

Lots of different ways to work it.

Not quite.  Rogue damage output freakishly large.  As long as you have
a good tank and the rogues are even marginally skilled with aggro
management, rogues can bring a LOT to a raid.

>clerics can't hit anything, can't take hits like warriors, and can't avoid

Not quite.  Post 50 they are the ONLY ones that can keep a warrior
healed up.  You'd need at least two druid/shaman to keep up with the
damage  that the warrior is taking, and then they'd pretty much have
no mana left over for anything else.

True, but most raids don't need 10 druids either, which is what they
get saddled with.

Generically speaking, if I was running a raid and I had healing,
buffing, nuking, crowd control, and melee all taken care of and I had
to pick between a druid and most other classes to fill the last
'slot', I would be hard pressed to come up with a reason to pick the
druid, all things being equal.

I don't really see this as a bad thing either, it's just one of the
limitations of the class.  Druids are given such versatility
throughout the game that they give up any specialty that makes them
required (for lack of a better word) in the end game.  There's never
any reason to NOT take a druid on a raid, but there isn't really any
reason TO take them either.
