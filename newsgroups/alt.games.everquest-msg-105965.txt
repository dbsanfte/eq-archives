Then you don't know standard proper netiquette. If the context is too
long snip irrelevant parts.

Demonstrate that you know when to top post correctly, then get back to
me on this.

>post? hahahahaha

Already done, every time I or anyone else doesn't answer a post
addressed to me or that person. You proceeded from the false
assumption that just because I choose to post means I am unable to
resist posting. That's a fallacy, missy, it's called non sequitur.
