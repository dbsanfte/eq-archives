There is no level, group, or raid situation where some clerics won't be
welcome. ;-)  So if you can hack the cleric lifestyle, it's a good
choice.

After that, the other two members of the "Holy Trinity" are *almost*
always called for. (warriors and chanters). Though there are high end
raid situations where only a couple chanters are needed, and you can
only productively use so many MA/SA tanks. Beyond them, other damage
dealing melee will always be preferred for those slots.

Wizards in the low levels are unappreciated and hard to level. But if
you can make it into the end game, it's a sure winner for most any
group/raid situation.

After that you get into "specialty niche" categories for other classes,
but they all have their place.
