I'd say that's pretty subjective and not just a little exaggerated.

I'm not talking about making your candidate of choice merely lose by 
less, I'm talking about helping him to win, or at the very least giving 
him some respectability for his next campaign. Regardless, if he's 
getting beaten so soundly, then there is likely a good reason for that.

Oh, but you *can* vote your conscience. That's what the process is all 
about. You merely refuse to do so. Too many people just can't get past 
the odds that it might be inconsistent with the ultimate outcome.

One should vote on who *should* take office, not who shouldn't. If you 
merely cast your vote to reflect who you want kept out of office, you are 
giving up your voice regarding who *should* be elected.

It's pretty simple, really. Which candidate is honestly thought to be the 
best person for the job by the most people? That's the candidate who 
should be in office.
