Hello All!!!!

A few questions:



1.  I am a lev. 24 HFL Druid.  I am in need of a range slot +wis item.
Do you know of any quests or mobs that I will get one from.  I need it
to be for a lev. 24 or slightly above.  I do not know any high lev.
players.

2.  The spell Sunbeam.  What does it do?  I have used it in 3 diff.
zones and the mob does nothing after I cast it.

3.  Good zones to fight in from 24-30?  I am currently in LOIO and hate
it.  I hate it for 2 reasons.  1.  I brought my lev. 28 monk up there
and am bored of it. 2.  Too may newbies that don't know anything.

Thank you in advance.
