That brings to mind a question I've had before and haven't been able
to answer given the levels of the mobs I face: how safe are some of
the ways I've seen for going AFK?  The two I use are Feign Death and
Hide.  (For the latter, I use the "/target myname" trick to check
whether I'm really hidden, and keep doing it till it works.)

I think that Hide works against both normal and undead mobs; are there
mobs that can see through it, or does each mob have some chance to see
through it, or is it truly safe?

As for Feign, I'm pretty sure that nothing will deliberately attack me
once I successfully feign (not counting spells that had already been
started, which can break the feign if they hit), but I've yet to face
a mob with an AE attack.  I assume I can be affected by an AE that
happens to include me.  But if I am, does that break the feign?

And are there other ways to avoid attention for extended periods?
