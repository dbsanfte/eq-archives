Funny thing about KSing, it's hard as hell to prove. Even witnessing,
if you didn't see things from the very beginning, it's hard to know
who's doing what. KS petitions were absolute nightmares when I was a
guide. Either the KSer had run off, logged off, or whatever and wasn't
a problem anymore but the player still demanded I do something, or the
player went out of his way to bait the KSer, sometimes even doing
things that did end up looking like he was trying to KS the KSer.

You gotta realize they can't take your word. You also gotta realize
that things don't always appear to be the way they are from the
"outside". People can and DO try to scam GMs all the time. Honestly,
it comes down to just being able to file a complaint against the
person. They add up eventually and will get them in trouble even if it
doesn't happen right away.

Personally, though, I'd rather the GMs be working on real issues than
spending an hour watching someone who's KSing now and then to slip up
and KS in front of him. KSers can be frustrating, yes. I know this
well, and I hate them too. But there are bigger things to worry about,
really.

On another note, I do have to question how you addressed this GM. (By
the sound of it, you already violated a "rule" (Not one that'll get
you punished) by bugging them with a direct tell instead of a GM)
Sounded like she was kinda impatient, and, judging from your tone
here, I wouldn't be surprised if she had reason for a lack of patience
with you...
