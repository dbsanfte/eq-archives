When they are dying too fast for you to DOT them effectively, congrats, you
are now a wizzie. Send the pet in. Watch the mob health. Then when it's at
half health, Lifetap. And any DD you may have. And if you like, use your
heals on the main tank (using lifetaps or leech to keep you healthy). But
wait for the tanks to get aggro very well before you hit with spells.

If they live long enough to get some dots on, stick 2 or three on, and don't
do anything else. It sounds like you are casting too much to get so much
aggro. If all else fails, never sit while the mob is alive. Yes it means you
may have more mana than anyone else, but that's why folks like us to twitch.
I tend to start a fight full mana and slightly down in health (75%ish),
halfway through fight go to about 50-60% mana and full health, and end ready
to start next one... near full mana and downish on health, if only using
DOTs.
