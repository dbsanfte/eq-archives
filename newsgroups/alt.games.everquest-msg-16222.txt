The ng is pretty new, I think, not a lot of traffic.  

The game is fun.  It's basically EQ with guns and looming depressing
architecture right now.  The graphics are great, although the decayed future
look means that the mission environment looks like a Doom level (many shades of
dull green).  I've only seen the low level corporate areas though, the rebel
lifestyle is as yet unknown to me.
