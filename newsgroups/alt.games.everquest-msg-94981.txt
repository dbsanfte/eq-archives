    I read it more like this: AFK mage with AFK dwarf PL recipient set up
shop down in Lake of Ill Omen. Druid comes along, wants to pull the area to
quad, but has extreme difficulty pulling stuff around the pet. In his
zealous drive to get a full quad and pull them all past the pet (because
less than four "isn't efficient"), he gets banged up enough that he tries to
Gate. He doesn't channel it through, everyone in the area is wiped. Now I'll
freely admit I don't know much about the relative efficiency of rotting
versus quadding for a druid, or if the geometry down there would allow for
singles to be pulled with Harmony without the pet adding in, but if I saw a
setup down there like that I wouldn't do something (try to pull a quad past
a pet) that's sure to get everyone killed, you know? I might very well have
petitioned the mage, to see if something like that is acceptable or not....

    As for the mage, well, I don't know how legitimate AFK pet camping is.
I've never seen Verant say one way or the other how they regard it. Since
the pet will be taking 50% (or so) of the XP, I couldn't even predict how
they'd rule on something like this. But what I do know is it was incredibly
stupid to set up an AFK XP camp in a busy area. You're just asking for
something to go wrong.
