Agro seems easy to manage. Mobs don't take too much convincing to be
pulled off my shammy.

No too many resists, mainly because they are blue, but I've enountered
blues that resist almost everything I trow at them.

Looks like you can manage the faction gains and losses on the mobs
within the city, but exactly how that works, I have no idea.

Can't summon a horse. (bah!)

Mobs do a pretty healthy bit of damage. Seem to have a good bit of AC
and HP too. (Then again this IS Luclin afterall.)
