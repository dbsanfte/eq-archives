Exactly.  They are known to bring about trash lawsuits, ludicrous ones
by all accounts.  And of course, they get tossed.  But It does take
resources to fight even bullshit lawsuits.  I don't really live in fear
of the Scientologist, but I sure as hell don't ever want to have to deal
with them, either.
