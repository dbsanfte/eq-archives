Which modern conservatives?  Conservativism seems to vary a lot depending 
on what country you're in.

}IIRC, it was Fascism they were fighting against, which is a political 
}model that no conservative would endorse.

Heh, I wouldn't be too sure about that.  Those that would endorse it would 
be very careful not to refer to it as fascism, however.  Usually seems 
there's at least one person of any category who'd endorse any other 
category, though.

From dictionary.com:

Fascism
n : a political theory advocating an authoritarian hierarchical government
(as opposed to democracy or liberalism)

So it sounds like whatever fascists are, they sure aren't liberals.

For comparison:

Conservative
adj. 1.Favoring traditional views and values; tending to oppose change. 
3.Moderate; cautious
5: conforming to the standards and conventions of the middle class

Liberal adj 1: showing or characterized by broad-mindedness n 1: a person
who favors a political philosophy of progress and reform and the protection
of civil liberties [syn: progressive] [ant: conservative] 2: a person who
favors an economic theory of laissez-faire and self-regulating markets

I find that last bit most amusing. :) I don't see how one could 
characterize fascism as either conservative or liberal.  There are probably 
fascists of both stripes.  If fascism is the local tradition, I'd expect 
conservatives to favor it.  If it hasn't been tried in these parts in a 
while, it's probably a liberal notion.
