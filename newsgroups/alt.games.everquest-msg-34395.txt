Hehe, when I would deign to bind folk with my Erudite necro, I had a
macro for the occasion, something along the lines of:

/glare
/say Cazic-Thule curse thee, %t - may your soul remain forever in this
place!
/cast 7 (my swap-out slot, where Bind affinity would be)

You wouldn't believe the number of people who thought I'd done something
horrible to them and be on the verge of petitioning, etc :)
