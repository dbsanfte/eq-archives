Hmmm...I didn't know about Tribunal.  The one with The Nameless went
something like this (this is from memory):

1. It went down.  I seem to recall this was a Friday night.

2. It stayed down a long time.  They finally got it working again by
Saturday morning.

3. People played all day Saturday, and then it went down again.  It
stayed down something like 12 hours, and then they told us the
hardware had completely died, and a new server would have to be
installed.  That took another 12 hours or so.

4. The new server came up, running from the Friday morning backup, so
something like a day's worth of play was lost.

5. All guild names were lost.  We were still in our guilds (e.g., /gu
went to the right people), but all our tags said something like
<unnamed guild>.  They were unable to restore guild names, and had to
disband all guilds.

6. Old deleted characters were restored.  I logged on, for example,
and my main and several others were not there, but several names I
didn't recognize were there.  After staring in shock for a while, I
recognized some of the names as being characters I had made, played
with for a few hours, and deleted, back on the first day I had EQ.  We
basically all had back every character we had ever made...you can
actually have more than 8 characters, it turns out, but the interface
only shows 8.  We were told to delete the ones we didn't want to keep,
and the ones we couldn't see would show up.  That worked.  Deleting
old ones made the hidden ones show.

7. The return of the deleted characters sometimes caused name
conflicts, causing the newer characters to get the dreaded "x" added
to their name.  There are still people running around on The Nameless
with "x"s acquired from this.  We were allowed to petition to get a
name change if we didn't like the "x", but we couldn't get the
original names back unless we could track down the account that now
had our name, and get that person to delete the character.

If this is what it is like after the backup procedure was improved,
I'd hate to see what the Tribunal folks went through! :-)

ps: The Nameless is an interesting server.  For a long time, it had
the largest Asian population (I don't know if it still does).  The
rumor is that in the Chinese translation of the setup instructions,
where it was supposed to say something like "choose the name of the
server", the translator translated it to "choose the nameless server",
so a huge fraction of Taiwanese players picked The Nameless. :-) 

There was also an organized effort by a big Taiwan guild to get all
Asian players to pick the Nameless and join that guild.  They hoped
that if they had a huge Asian guild, so it was really apparent that
there were a lot of them playing, all on the same server, they could
convince Verant to put a server in Taiwan and /movelog them all to it.

The Nameless was a good illustration of why regional servers are
needed.  There were no guides or GMs on it who spoke Chinese, Korean,
or Japanese, and some guilds took advantage of that.  They'd train or
KS or otherwise ignore the PnP in contested areas, and if someone
petitioned, all they would say to the guide or GM is "no ABC", and the
guild or GM wouldn't be able to do anything.  Outside of
confrontations with other players and dealing with guides, these same
people had no trouble with "ABC". :-)

When The Nameless also developed a strong European guild, things
really got interesting.  Fixed patch times and spawns on long fixed
timers just don't work well when you've got strong guilds from three
continents on a server.

Now that European guild has /movelogged off to AB, and probably a lot
of the Asian guilds will be going to the new Asian server.  The
Nameless will become a lot more peaceful, but also a lot less
interesting, la~.
