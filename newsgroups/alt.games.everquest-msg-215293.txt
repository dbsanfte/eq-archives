I like doing a master looter, with tradeskill and research components 
randed for at the end.  If the master looter abuses their position, spam 
the public server forums about it and don't group with 'em again.

There's just as much chance for abuse with all the other systems as there 
is with a master looter.  Alpha looting may have worked well in highkeep, 
but when you're killing and moving as fast as you can keeping track of it 
becomes cumbersome.  Should someone mention it in an adventure that I'm a 
part of I would roll my eyes.  Then again, I'm not so focused on the minor 
plat drops that I sweat the extra 20pp that a master looter might keep for 
themselves.  That's like 2 mobs worth.
