I have just begun EQ2 and have one character in each city, a wanna-be
Enchanter in Freeport and a fledgling Warrior in Qeynos. My Warrior is now
finding decent drops to sell for money to support his growing armor
addiction, but my Enchanter is having trouble raising the cash to get his
book collection started for tradeskills. Where is there a good place to get
money for each of them. Even the Warrior is only getting things of 75cp and
less. I am assuming that the money scale in EQ2 is MUCH reduced from EQ.
Both characters are lvl 11 and by that level in EQ I had already carried
around a few platinum. My warrior has finally worked his way up to the grand
sum of 10sp. I am NOT asking for cheats or anything, just honest reports of
the best place to "farm" items that will support my in-game hobbies.
