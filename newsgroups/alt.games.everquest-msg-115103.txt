  I don't necessarily see it as messing with someone's business, since
really it isn't the same market.  People don't buy SoW potions because they
need a SoW now, they typically buy them because they don't want to have to
be at the whim of a SoW casting class (that might not even be around) when
they "need" the extra speed.  I bought a few 10 dose SoW potions so I could
make 10 trips across Antonica faster when I needed to without having to
waste time looking for a SoW and they served me extremely well in that
capacity.

  Granted, it is a bit mean spirited to give away SoWs with the intention of
"competing" with a shaman trying to sell SoW potions, but at the same time
it's nice to see people willing to take the time out of their day to help
others with their magic for free instead of "prosituiting" their spells for
platinum.
