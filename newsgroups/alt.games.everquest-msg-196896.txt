The only thing I can think of as useful with another special melee skill 
being maxed is the AA Class ability Dragon Punch:

"Dragon Punch: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points) - This ability gives 
the Monk a chance to produce a knockback effect when striking with a Dragon 
Punch. This ability works in the same way that an item 'proc' works. "

I have no idea how well it works, or how often, but it might be useful on 
casters, as knockbacks can interrupt and DP has a pretty good cycle time.
