It's more or less impossible to cancel a usenet message. News servers
have been ignoring cancel requests for a long long time now due to the
ease in which they could be used maliciously.

Asking for cheats for a multiplayer game in a place like this from
someone who is familiar with usenet seems singularly naï¿½ve though.

"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
