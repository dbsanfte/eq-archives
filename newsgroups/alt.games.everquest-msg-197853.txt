Being a chain wearer I can tell you that with AC increases that are going 
to get you up to the 1000 mark, you're going to get a lot of HP increases 
as well.  I think I have all of 1 piece of gear with no HP or STA: Imbued 
Granite Spaulders (20 AC, +10 to all saves, shoulder slot).

Most my stuff is rogue usable.  Notable exceptions being BP and hat.

Looking for an upgrade to the griffon fang earring next I think.
