I'd like that as well. Verant has a history of 'fixing' the wrong
problems to get around bugs. Certainly if I have an active character
on a server, I'd like to be able to get hooked back up to that
character immediately, and not wait for some arbitrary timeout that
appears to have been put into place for no other reason than to work
around a dupe bug that they didn't care to fix correctly.
