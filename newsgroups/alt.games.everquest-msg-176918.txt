Hello,

I saw the spell 'paralzying earth'(root) on a website that said it was
available to a wiz at 49. The guide said it was a research spell so I found
it at the bazaar and come to find out I'm not allowed to use. I have bought
other research spells from the bazaar with good luck. Is there more than one
version of this spell? Or maybe they discontinued it from the wiz spell line
up. Is there any root spells for a wiz beyond 'instill' for a wiz if they
did remove this one from the line up?

Thanks in advance,
Archait(50)
Bertox.
