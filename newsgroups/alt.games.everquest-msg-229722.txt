Iksar are listed specifically as one of the races that inhabit
Freeport. (Doesn't seem to be on the official site, but I do remember
seeing it somewhere else, information coming from SOE)

As for the Vah'shir, I don't see how they ALL could have been wiped
out with Luclin, as many came to Norrath when the Nexus was opened.
People have observed that the Kerrans of EQ2 are larger and seem more
advanced. My speculation is that the Kerrans in EQ2 are, in fact, the
result of the kerrans mixing with the remaining Vah'shir.
