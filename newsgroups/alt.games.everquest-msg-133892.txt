I was good- I wore my Oracle robe for 40 levels even though it clashed
terribly with my skin. Now I'm wearing a Crystalline... which doesn't clash
with my skin on the new models (although it's the same color as my skin on
the old). However, it's a puke green color on the new. EW.

I gotta get me some GOOD clothes. 4 more levels, or maybe less, and I'll go
hunt in SG for a full set of netted kelp. Then I can look really sexy.
