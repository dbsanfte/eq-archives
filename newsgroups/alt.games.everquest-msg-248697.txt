I too am a UK player, although I've been loitering around since it was
first released.

IMO it doesn't make a lot of difference which server you chose as they
all have thier pro's & con's.

If you go for one of the newer servers you will find predominantly
newer players, VS fro instance was a new server not a split so its
only transfers who've gone there.

This means you may find it harder to get a group, however you will
potentially be grouping with players of a similar level & not a bucket
load of twinks.  It also means that the economy is a bit more stable
(I created a toon on VS when it first launched as a bit of a
diversion.  Proces are much different to home on Povar).

If you chose one of the older servers, like Povar, you have the
problem that much of the economy is inflated at the top end, but
bargins are to be had at the lower end as theres less demand.  You'll
also be faced with most of the lower levels being alts rather than
mains.  This is a 2 edged sword in that grouping with them can have
the effect of a degree of PL to you & a greater chance of getting
loots as they are generally twinked to the eyeballs!

Another potential problem is that as a UK player on a US server at the
lower end you can find it hard to get groups at times, all the
americans being in bed when we want to play, although this is a bonus
for camping quests ).

At the top end it does mean that raids can go on into the early (and
sometimes late) hours of the morning so be prepared for sleepless
nights.  You may also find it harder to get into a decent guild as the
entry restrictions can be pretty onerous (ours is lvl 65 with certain
AA skills & elemental flags which would mean you'd be pretty hard
pressed as a new pplayer ever to catch that far up).

The beauty of the game is that it lets you play it as you wish,
there's no set route to follow.  The drawback is its so addictive that
you'll get dragged in!!

Good luck on however you decide to play!
