I like the part where he says they won't last long, that way, when 
people buy them, and none of them work he can say...

"oh i guess they just fixed that one, uh yeah, and that one too, oh? 
that one too eh? What? None of them work? I'm sorry to hear that... I 
don't actually play EQ; my account was banned... no, I'm sorry, there 
are no refunds. Want to buy my new cheats guide! Better buy it fast... 
they won't last long!!"
