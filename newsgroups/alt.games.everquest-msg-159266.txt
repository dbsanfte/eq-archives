Anyways, is the in-game music supposed to be as nice as the opening
mp3??  I changed my midi driver to say MS GS Wavetable SW Synth
instead of Creative SB Live Synth and at least can hear music now;
however it sounds the same as before.  For example outside Felwithe
it's a repeating theme that still sounds computerized to me and is the
same song.  I thought there were some new compositions?

By the way I think they're *.xmi nowadays.  (The s3d files are
textures I think).
