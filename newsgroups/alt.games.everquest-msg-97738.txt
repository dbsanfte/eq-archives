I had to look that word up.

Though I don't recall seeing your opinion at all, if it is the same as
Jazz's then even though, as an opinion, its not necessarily wrong, its
still less supportable.

You wish to claim all opinions are equal? That's the same sort of
thinking that gets creationism into schools.

So your opinion is only based on generalities, not specifics.

That's great. Let us know when you're willing to join the conversation
the rest of us are having - about THESE changes, not changes in
general.

No evidence given on WHY other than the already hammered "because the
game has been dumbed down", though.

Knows, no. Can make educated speculation, yes. And that depends on the
evidence. Of which yours is sadly lacking.

And yet you have not said *how*. You make the assumption that the game
is so much easier that it will. You can't back up this idea that the
game is so much easier, however.

God how many times will I need to beat this into your heads. When you
jump to the idea that the game is too easy you are making an
assumption without proving the patch does just that. And no one has.


>That being said, I, just like you, am spouting off for the hell of it.

I asked because if you didn't disagree you would be arguing for no
reason. But you do disagree. Misguided, but not spouting off.

I agree. I, for one thing, don't assume every opinion is equal - I
give weight to actual evidence.

It's called critical reasoning. Try it sometime.
