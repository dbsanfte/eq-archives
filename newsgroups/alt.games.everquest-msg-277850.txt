Interesting thing about this poll, is that there is zero credibility to 
it. In a two response poll: "Yes", and "Keep it the fuck off my server", 
You could have 95% of the response say 'keep it the fuck off my server', 
and SoE could still proudly announce the next day that the server would 
be going exchange enabled 'due to the considerable interest in it 
expressed in the polls.'

We have no reason to beleive SoE is looking for a majority. We have 
every reason to beleive that SoE is looking for just enough people to 
use it to offset the number of people that cancel their accounts, and 
not one more.

Besides we have -never- seen the actual poll results of a previous poll, 
nor any proper analysis of them. Its a joke.
