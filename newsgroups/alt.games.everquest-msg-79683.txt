Because they're there, they're worth xp, it sometimes makes RP sense
to kill the guards (A paladin killing the corrupt militia, for
example). If the person killing the guards is chipping in to help
newbies that come that way in trouble, they're fine. If they're not
paying attention enough to notice most of the newbies in trouble,
they're a tad selfish, but fine. If they stand there and obviously
watch the mob mow down the newbie in trouble laughing all the while,
then they're "assholes and dickheads"...
