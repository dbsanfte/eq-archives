It appears to be able to spawn pretty much anywhere. I've seen it near the
North side of the lake where the river dumps into the lake; traveling
Northerly from a line exteding from the windmill; and near the mountains
just East of the Sarnak fortress. He's not easy to pin down at all, and he's
only Level 14, so he tends to get wiped out by the Goblins. Also, I'm not
aware of any particular spawn time or placeholders.

Best bet is to either luck out and run across him, use a Tracker, or often
times people will kill him and shout out his location for a quick loot.
