One question I have had is this, how do you find out who the leader of a
guild is?  Obviously you can not ask this twit.  He might have a friend or
an alt to direct you to.

I met one guy who freely admits he does not respect camps because the
official Varent stance is that there is no such thing.  No matter how many
people told him that his views were not that great he stated that if he
wanted to force sharing he would, and could always get a GM to enforce it.

I wanted to make sure his guild leader knew this opinion, but did not know
how to find out who to talk to.
