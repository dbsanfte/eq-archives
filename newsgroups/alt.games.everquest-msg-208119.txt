To be fair, I said it was useless, not Palindrome.

And I agree, if you are going to be charming, its not useless to tash 
first.  BUT I only said it was useless under 20, at which point you'll 
only have the "Charm" spell, and your druid buddy will only have "Snare" 
instead of "Ensnare", so you'll get mobs that break charm very early on 
just because the max duration is short, and they will likely not be 
snared because that will have worn off too.

At higher levels, tactics that were a joke in the low levels become 
highly important and useful tools.
