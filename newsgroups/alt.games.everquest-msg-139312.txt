yes. self styled is right. my friends professor was a volunteer field
researcher so i went along to see what was up. happened to show up at
the freakshow. by the way....what if i thought i was a scorpion and
wanted the doctors to change my body accordingly? shouldnt someone
step up and say "no...you are not a scorpion...now, lets discuss why
you think you are a scorpion" (although i admit that having claws and
a poison stinger would be pretty cool)
