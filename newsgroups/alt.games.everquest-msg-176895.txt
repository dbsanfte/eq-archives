	It was before I had AM3 so I wasn't using Archery, and they were trying to
pin it on a wall anyway, so autoattack was already on.  AoW had chewed through
about half the raid before turning on me.

	A couple of other Rangers had basically the same results.  Of course, this
was due to the insane number of people present; it was a public raid.
