Verant just has too many machines in one place, and not enough
routers/bandwith to coverthem all. It is a problem when a game gets too
popular.

Counter-Strike had / has the same issues on thier patch days. Not enough
mirrors, not enough servers....etc. At least CS game servers at all over the
place. Try something like over 5000 servers world wide, and all on different
providers and backbones.

I know they don't WANT to go geographical, but it might not be an option.
Maybe they need MS to show them how to do a single location farm? MS gets
hacked and ping attacked all the time, and we hardly ever notice it because
they have such HUGE pipes and massive redundancy. Granted I don't expect
Verant to have THAT much bandwith, but they  should be staying ahead of
demand rather then playing catch up.

....but that's just my opinion.
