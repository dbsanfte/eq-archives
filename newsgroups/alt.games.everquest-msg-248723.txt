As a software engineer, you should know better. DOS, Windows, and NT
are a great example of how you don't REPLACE your success, you build
on it, and re-write what you have to, but you leave your customer base
intact.

SOE is replacing EQ with EQ2, but with no clear sense of what that
means for EQ players. EQ is simply left hanging as a question mark.
Good way to invite people to play WoW, bad way to get them to keep
playing your game.

If they had said "we're holding all expansions for a bit while we
re-write EQ to make it more scalable and supportable," the customer
base would have been thrilled. They could have released "EQ2" as an
upgrade to EQ, transitioned characters to the new servers with some
marketing fluf for revenue (pay $20 and the transition to the new
servers comes with an extra skill line of your choice and an item
upgrade with EQ2-specific abilities).

But no, they're trying to release a sequel to a community. I don't
even know what that IS.
