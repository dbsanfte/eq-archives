Most to sta, maybe a few to int, as long as the agil
is already 75. SK doesn't use WIS.

Raw int or wis on hybrids is not really a big deal, Sta/ac/hp
are the most important, they are a melee who can cast. Besides that,
tons of affordable SK/PALLY friendly gear is plus ac/hp and often
mana.

I'd be an ogre one instead though, 75 agil and the rest to sta.
