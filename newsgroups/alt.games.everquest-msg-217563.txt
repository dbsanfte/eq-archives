Who sends their children out to play among the enemy?  Who?  You would think
that the strong would be most likely to make forays into enemy territory and
that the weak and children would be protected.  Yet, I always see little
orcs out among the Humans near Freeport, and the strongest guarding the
kings in their camps.  And the gnoll pups wander right up to the gates of
Halas, while the true strengnth of gnolldom snickers at the foolishness from
the safety of their lairs.  I'd have to say that this is a rather insane
situation, or the mobs are just plain idiots.
