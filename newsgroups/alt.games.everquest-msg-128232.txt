Hell, I thought I was the only one this stuff happened to.

I've worked in jobs dealing with the public for over 10 years in Midland,
Michigan (there, I said it, I hate them bastards) where Dow Headquarters is.
And ya know, for a city where one almost needs a master's degree to get a
minimum wage job, these people are S-T-U-P-I-D.  (Sorry, had to spell it so
they couldn't read it.)  Not only are they stupid, but they are rudest
people I've ever met, as well as stuck up ignorant bastards in general.

If you guys ever get a chance to move to Midland, Michigan, don't.  I
repeat, DON'T.  The money might be nice, but you'll kill yourselves after
two weeks of being here because of the stupidity alone.
