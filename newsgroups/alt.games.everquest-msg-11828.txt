Before your reply, I was completely nieve(did I spell that right? My
spell checker didn't like it but had no correction) about what Esperanto
is.  I was so ignorant that I thought it was some form of language
composed of a mix of several languages.  I was going to make some reply
about not having time(months to years) to learn nor anyone in my area
who speaks the language.

I the middle of composing that reply, I decided to look it up on the
web(google.com), so I wouldn't look completely ignorant.  I went to
http://www.esperanto.net/

Boy was I ignorant.  It's ... it's...   I'm still to stunned to respond
properly.  

It is a 'one letter = one sound', 'regular and exception-free formal
grammar', language with an 'easily learned system of forming new words
from words you already know'.  It is a designed language, designed to be
easy.

But you already knew that.

Dankon por la informo.
(Thankyou for the information.)
