Dudes... I keep saying this but nobody listens... PLAY A BL!!  They're fun,
lots of new stuff to do all the time, I never sit doing one thing for hours
even when exp-grinding, and red and yellow MOBs die like lemmings... you
can't beast a beastlord for soloing, trust me!

(One of these days someone's going to speak up and tell me I don't know what
I'm talking about, and hey, I haven't played very long so maybe I don't, but
I like my kitty.  Ogres think they know how ta barsh fings?  Wait'll you see
my kitty in barshin' mode!)
