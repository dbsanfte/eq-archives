You must know something about WWII that I don't, or you're passing on
some bizarre conspiracy theories.  I'm guessing the latter.  Feel free
to supply more information.  Please cite your sources.  Thanks.

False.  Use of nuclear weapons by a major power will almost certainly
lead to WWIII and the destruction of most of humanity.  You just can't
nuke a country and then merely apologize when the radioactive cloud
floats over neutral and allied countries alike.  It's not an option.
