I have to agree with you where is it written that it is your responsibility
to heal someone. I have seen a level 24 ranger take on the AC in S Ro and
expect and get pissed off when someone doesn't help him kill it. Just
because its a rare spawn and you are the first to see it if its red to you
leave it alone don't expect someone to come to your rescue and get pissed
off when they don't. I don't know what level the Bard was and nothing
against Bards but they cant solo worth a crap. They are an outstanding group
member and can kite to some degree against a melee class.
