I have 384 right now.  It's okay.  Luclin is still hideously bad though.  
Gave up trying to play a kitty since a) I couldn't find the friggin 
quest character at the top of the bar and b) the lag was tremendous, 
making me get lost about twice as much as usual.  Even WITH a map I 
found that zone a bitch to get through.
