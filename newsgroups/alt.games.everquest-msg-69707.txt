The runts and all that stuff are hardly worth the effort, the faction
hit is trivial.  I hunting various kobald camps around Stonebrunt for
a few levels. Finally got to Indifferent to Paineel. but guess what,
need to be ambiable to get the key.

Couple hours in Warrens. Keep king room clear, killed him 2-3 times.
and was ambiable. Pushed me up to Ally with erudin guards as well
