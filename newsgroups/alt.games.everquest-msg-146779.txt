Try Eastern Wastes.  South of Kael, there is a place with a lot of Walrus'.
The range from around level 30 to around level 39, and don't seem to have a
lot of hitpoints.  I didn't find that area until 52, when they were mostly
green or light blue, but there was still the occasional blue at 52, and they
were very easy kills.  (I was there for the Ulthork Men of War, which are 40
to 42 or 43).

If you go straight East from Kael for a bit, and then turn South, there is
another area that could be good.  Plenty of Whooly Mammoths that I think
will be doable at your level, although they may be a little too high on
hitpoints to quad.
