I found a new quest NPC (Xantomo Salmor) just by the bank in Qeynos (by the
water that leads into the sewers). He goes on about a story of heroes and a
prize scroll and that he has a copy of the scroll, a golden scroll of
somekind. I can't seem to trigger him to read it aloud though... Anyone else
found him? (He isn't a static spawn).
