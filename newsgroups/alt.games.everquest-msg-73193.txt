Ok, let the flame war begin:
Yes, it is!

You got my full acknowledgement there!
Only because there _is_ a naming policy doesn't
mean that it's sensible. If some player has a name that offends others,
like BinLaden, EatMyPussy (I'm sure you get the picture) or is just plainly
objecting to a fantasy world, like Spiderman, Rogerrabbit or the like, then
I would say it is ok to petition.

If, for a change, someone chooses a name of his favourite fantasy
 character, then he/she usually means to play this character seriously,
and most likely the name is representative for the character they
want to roleplay.

If people go for a mis-spelling of that name because the name itself
won't pass the filter, then I personally can't understand, because it
looks a bit stupid, but I'd say it's their personal decision.

And by all means: chosing a name out of fantasy lecture is _not_
unimaginative, not by all means, it is probably just the expression
of the desire to be like ones personal hero(ine).

If the name was allowed, then Drizzt would be the one person
I'd have loved to play - but his class wouldn't have fit me.

So Matron Malice was the one to go for, as in the story she does
summon the spirit of Zaknafein from the realm of the dead to
reanimate his corpse, and thus is some kind of a necromancer.

Since that name wouldn't pass the filter, I chose not a misspelling,
but a variation, Maliciosa, which is btw. perfectly according to
Verants naming policy, as it is just the spanish word for
malicious / a malicious woman. And that is actually the kind
of naming that Verant supports in their policy.

As for my last name - I can come up with any number of names
that I made up on my own, I just didn't _want_ to, because
I liked it. So what? It _is_ childish to have a problem with
such.

Just an example: R.A. Salvatore does play Everquest himself,
just since we all don't know his characters names nor the
server he plays on, wouldn't it be perfectly alright - at least
for him - to choose one of his own characters? :-)

I think, someone petitioning the name Frodo has a serious
problem with his (real) life.

There is a german word for such people, that I am very sorry
I cannot translate, maybe some of you know it: "Petze"

Just my 2c,


      Lars aka. Maliciosa Do'Urden
