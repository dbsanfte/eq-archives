 And you also burn people out on raids. Face it, some people would like
to gain levels (after all that's a help to the guild) and will start
dropping out of raids if you have one every day. No matter what you do
you're not going to have much luck (imo) trying to sustain the "fun"
level of overraiding. Either that or they'll start hiding out on an
unguilded alt.

 I don't think you should do anything to "slow everyone's XP gain rate".
Basically you should try and find a good balance between raiding and XP
days. For some reason that never ends up being as easy as it sounds.
