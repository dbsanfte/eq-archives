Not true.  The first clause in the sentence is subordinate.  Putting a
period where you suggest creates a sentence fragment.

The word is steal, not steel.  And the U.S. is not getting ready to attack
an innocent nation, you bleeding heart fuckwit.

Degenration?  Did you mean to say degeneration?  For all the times you used
that same word in this diatribe, you should be able to type it correctly,
no?

I hope you get the gist of my response.  There is an axiom in Usenet, that
if you criticize someone on spelling and grammar, you will almost always
have spelling and grammar mistakes in your own flame.  It's only a matter of
time until someone comes along and shows me the mistakes I've made in this
response.
