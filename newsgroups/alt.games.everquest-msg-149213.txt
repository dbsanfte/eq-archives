The only quest I can think of is the hero bracer quest. You gotta keep
killing the minotaur lord inside the minotaur caves in steamfont
mountains. The lord has a place holder so it takes a while. Anyway
once the lord is killed there is a chance the Minotaur hero will spawn
on the other side of the little canyon there and hug the wall running
towards the entrance to the cave. Anyway, kill him and loot his chains
or shackles or whatever. Goto qeynos and look under the warrior guild
in the jail place and find this guy in a room full of doors. If you
did the steel warriors or whatever bracer quest this is the guy that
told you to enter the one of those doors and fight a lion for the last
part of the quest. Anyway talk to him and get him to tell you about
the quest, if he says the usual "I don't trust you with this quest"
there is a quest in WC to give bottles of milk to this guy sitting
near the lake behind one of the merchant houses there. It can get you
a lot of faction with steel warriors fast but it will kill your
freeport militia faction too if you care. Anyway once your faction is
high enough just give him the shackles or whatever the item you looted
from the Minotaur Hero is called and he will hand you back the hero
bracer. If I remember right it's 9ac +10 str +5DR/PR. It's a nice
little item to just equip yourself with if you need strength or sell
for about 500pp-800pp. Waiting for the hero to spawn usually takes 3
hours. I know because I did this quest almost 3 times in a row once
and that was almost the exact interval it came in as long as I killed
the lord every time it spawned. Hope that helps some.

The Hero bracer itself is not nodrop but it is lore so if I were you
and you want to do this quest a few times I'd have a few characters
ready to hold them as you get them. Good luck, hope you can make some
money this way.

PS- By the way as long as you med up and heal and such non of the guys
you have to kill should give you any problems at all. Just don't
explore the cave, the main gnome boss in there is a necro and combine
his power and spells with the 2 guards that are in his room and it
could cause you many problems. Keep wolf form or sow on just incase
you need to get the hell out of there. :p The lord's spawning place is
in the front parts of the cave so don't worry about running into him
otherwise.
