If you want a glossary of terms go here:
http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqglossary.htm

This site has a break down of all the class you can play.
Including making characters and numerous guides on where you can level
(although player made so some are dodgy !)
http://eq.crgaming.com/

This site has links to all the zones, including maps and strategy guides and
importantly quest guides
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/

Lots and lots of other sites as well.

I didn't get much out of EQ until I started using sites like this to
understand what the hell was going on.
