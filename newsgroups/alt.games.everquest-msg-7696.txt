On that point I'll happily disagree. I don't just make the backpacks,
I use them - usually I carry two. On countless occasions I've expanded
the amount of loot I can carry, and as a side effect the amount of
time I could fight before being forced to make a trip to a merchant,
through the use of the ten percent reduction. Careful arrangement of
the heaviest loot into the best weight reducers has been quite
profitable to me.

Buy the pack once, get the benefit of it forever.
