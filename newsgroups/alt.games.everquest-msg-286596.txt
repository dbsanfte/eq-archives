I can tell you from experience that WoW has *far* fewer bugs than EQ.
Vanguard, on the other hand, is reputed to be incredibly bug ridden
(and that's based on reports from people who have played a wide
variety of MMOs, including EQ, EQ2, and WoW).  So the argument that
"all MMOs have a ton of bugs" just doesn't make it.  

Yes, testinng is hard.  But as the "wharf rat" pointed out, there are
things you can do, like regression testing the new AA calculations
against the old, that aren't rocket science and don't require checking
every path through the code.  They just require a mindset that you are
going to test what can be tested before you release the code to
customers.  And over the long haul, that would save work for the EQ
development team.
