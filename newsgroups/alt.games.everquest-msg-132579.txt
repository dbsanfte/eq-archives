3097 dammage in one minute for 1020 mana. (takes 2 and a half minutes to
recover that mana btw) . my monk has a dps soloing around 80 . Thats around
4800 dammage a minute, his regen rate with mend equals the dammage rate of
katta guards which stay blue to 60. He is a twink of mine so while his
equipment is good it is by no means top end. so by your figures he is only
4800/3097 x 2.5 or 3.8 times as good at soloing as your druid. Thats
assuming you have no resists and yeah thats about right. Incidently the
front line monks in my guild more than double my dps.

> Or a druids ability to travel.

which is incredibly nice and the primary reason I think everyone envies
them.

> Or a druids buffing ability.

potg not bad for powerleveling at all. Never used for anything else.

> Or the fact that druids are the second best nukers in the game.

are they really ? is nuking a critical ability?

A wizard is twice as good a nuker as a druid. Would it suprise you so much
to find out that magicians, clerics , and enchanters all have nukes that are
comparable over a 2 minute spread?

400 mana 7000 heal from the cleric
400 mana 2400 heal from 2 torpors from the shaman
400 mana 880 heal from the druids

Yes the monk hunting ground is smaller than a druids but then again a druids
hunting ground is much smaller than a shamans, chanters, or necro.
