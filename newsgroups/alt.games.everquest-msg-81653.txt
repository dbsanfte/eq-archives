I have no idea what a boutique guild is, but that's ok. :)

I'm very excited, tonight I take over an account of another class that's
under accounted for...shaman.  My very own level 48 shaman *sniff*.  I'm
hoping he has a 40+ rogue on there too. <g>

Trouble is, my main is a 55 enchanter (anywhere from highly desired to
damned near required) and the only 56 rezzer in my guild is my
brother...whom I borrow from time to time.  He's required for anything
indoors after 50 as well.  I'm not skilled enough to play both at the same
time under pressure and lord knows enchanters get enough pressure.  And now
I'm taking on this shammy...shammies...not really required anywhere there's
a bard or enchanter, but when I do play him on my other computer I'll be
CONSTANTLY bugged by the damned tanks for buffs. :p
