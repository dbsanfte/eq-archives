succor puts you at he ZL to WW. You appear in a small piece of tunnel. There
are mobs there that will agro you, but so long as you dont run the wrong way
youll be in WW with plenty of safetly margin. If you dont hit a zoneline
right away try the other direction. Maybe someone could post the direction
you have to be heading to WW. Succor will work from anywhere (in this zone),
so no need to take risks moving in.
