Actually I think the raid point system is a little unfair myself.
I can never get the points, even tho I want to help do raids, they
always seem to be scheduled when I can't play.

I play a LOT  but seems to be murphy's law.... everytime there is a
guild raid I have to  work during that time.

I only seem to be able to get into OPEN raids that I hear about while
I am online at the time.
