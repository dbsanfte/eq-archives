Are you serious ? My experience with LoY has been the exact opposite of
yours. The Exp is phenomenal, and far FAR better than what I could get at a
similar level in an outdoor zone. Not to mention the loot is not at all bad.

Anywhere where I can make a level a NIGHT from 38-44 duoing with a cleric of
similar level is good Exp in my book.
