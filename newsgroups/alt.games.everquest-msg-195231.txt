You're making it very difficult for me to maintain my "kindler, gentler"
facade here.  I will content myself with pointing out that the first
half of that statement is mostly false (hospitals and sick people, while
not reasonably comparable to EQ, are more complex), and the second half
is irrelevant (the only useful application of the concept of "novelty"
here is to the producer, not the consumer).

And the version of EQ we play today is a far cry from the version we
were playing four years ago.

Your willful and deliberate ignorance is what's laughable.

Fascinating how you can notice this here and yet still think of your
snide remark above as being somehow topical.

Ok, go back and play "original" EQ.  You know, the version of the game

that's been static for the last four years.  Oh wait, _that_ game
doesn't exist!  I wonder why?  Perhaps because not enough people are
willing to pay for a subscription game that doesn't keep renewing
itself?  Perhaps because most of the people paying for over 450,000
subscribed accounts prefer novelty to boredom, innovation to stasis?

Oh, and one more thing...  CIHYS?
