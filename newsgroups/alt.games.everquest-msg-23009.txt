Subject: New Mobs in Befallen?

The other night i went to befallen to stock up on some bone chips.
Unfortunately i was caught in a train on the ledge beyond the locked door and
died a pitiful death. It was late and since im running from nektolous forest i
decided to leave the corpse run untill i played again (The joys of being past
level 6 :)
So i return to befallen tonight and find a whole new host of mobs in there that
are slaying everybody left right and centre, myself included. 
5 times ive been back and i cant get to my corpse because im simply getting
minced every time i try. Has this dungeon been changed? and any suggestions on
what i can do about this situation?, these mobs are way way above my level 10
necromancer.
