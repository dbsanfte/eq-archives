I have the opposite problem - I can't change down the resolution from
1024*768 to 800*600.
I normally play EQ in 800*600 (it's a PII 450MHz, 32 MB ATI Card, so
any higher is too slow), but when I run the new UI it pops up in
1024*768, but my mouse only can move within 800*600 of the screen.  In
other words there is a border of 224 pixels down the right hand side
of the screen and 168 across the bottom of the screen that my mouse
doesnt register.

I have tried to change the screen size in-game, and I can, but when
the 15-second mouse dialogue pops up ("do you want to keep these
settings") I can't click on yes, so it resets back to 1024 * 768.  The
mouse pointer just doesn't move at all in the lower resolution.

Has anyone else experienced this?

On a side note - I do like the new UI so far, and the char selection
screen is neat.  I like the explore feature where you can see your
characters from any of your other character's perspective.  I havent
had time to play with any of the XML settings yet but look forward to
doing some poking around this weekend.

Cheers,

Tzen.
