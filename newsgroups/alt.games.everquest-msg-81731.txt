But you don't have to go searching.  When the inventory window is up, there
is, really, there is, an auto equip box.  It is not small, it is on the left
side of the inventory window.   Drop the foraged item in the auto equip box,
and if you have a stack of them going, it will be added to the stack.  If
you don't have a stack going, then it will start a new one in the first
available inventory slot.
