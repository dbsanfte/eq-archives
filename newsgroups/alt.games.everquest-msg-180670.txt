Thanks, I think I'm getting there. I clicked the 'advanced' menu and did a
complete file check. It then wanted to download about ten hours (at 56k)
worth of files! That was with PoP and Luclin ticked. I unticked the Luclin
box and loaded about half the PoP files and then tried it. This time it
worked, I got into the game. It was fine til I tried to sell some stuff
through a vendor then it crashed to desktop. I'll try disabling sound and
update some more files. It's odd because it worked ok before during my first
installation even without all those updated files, the problem was only
intermittent.
