Not only that, but most of the pre-order joints get the crap in at the same
time as local stores.  You then have to wait for shipping.  I've known of a
few people who have pre-ordered items and received it much later than those
who just went to the store and picked it up.   I am quite surprised that
anyone would even bother to preorder.
