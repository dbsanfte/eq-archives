    Oh, lord. This weekend there was THREE Left Corner groups at once. And
one person, who switched between all public channels was apparently
concerned that anyone touching his spider was a KSer.... and THEN the
Velketor raid zoned in and we started losing people to LD at about one per
10 minutes. I even heard at one point some dim bulb trained UP to the Upper
Spiders group when coming to join them.
