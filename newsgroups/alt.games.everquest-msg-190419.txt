There aren't many places left to get the kind of aoe experience you've
heard about as they were all nerfed back before PoP came out. One of the
last was Acrylia Caverns and a random 100% resist to fire/cold/magic was
added to the mobs there effectively ending it as a good aoe spot. The
only zone I know of that's left that's supposed to be ok for AoE groups
is the Deep, but I haven't seen anyone there in a long time. At this
point 55-60 is probably faster in teir 1 PoP planes grouped.
