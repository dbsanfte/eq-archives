I wouldn't.  Sure, there are some stories where it works that way,
but it many cases (including, I should note, most tabletop role-
playing games where player characters can get charmed), the charmed
player is expected to use his/her wits to hinder the antagonist,
either by resisting every step of the way, or by interpreting all
commands literally, etc.  (E.g., if you're just told to attack your
friends, you don't have to do it using your most powerful weapons
or spells.)

I recall one tabletop game where I was GM and the players were
encountering their first (fairly low-level) dragon.  The entrance
to the room was a tunnel-crawl so they were entering one at a time.
The dragon could cast Charm twice a day, so it charmed the first
one in (a tank), and as the others entered the charmed player told
them it was safe, the dragon was friendly.  As the encounter
progressed, the dragon found an opportunity to charm the party's
cleric.  The party leader was a suspicious sort, though; while I'd
been charming the first player (talking to him in another room),
the others had arranged a signal.  The party leader gave the signal,
which told the cleric to cast Dispel Magic on the area.  The cleric
doublechecked with me as GM, and I agreed that there was nothing
about being charmed that would make her unwilling to cast an
apparently non-hostile spell when instructed.

(The dispel did remove both charms, but it also cancelled all of
the light-producing items the party was carrying, so the ensuing
battle was still rather messy. :-)
