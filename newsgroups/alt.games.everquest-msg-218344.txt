You're being completely irrational. In a large city, it is absolutely
impossible to stamp out crime without locking all the citizens in
their homes and cutting them off completely from the outside world.
Among large gatherings of people, crime WILL happen. Period. The
city's responsibility is to do what they can to lessen it and punish
it when it does happen. However, it is not the fault of the city when
it does happen.

If the "loss of mind" can be directly blamed on the virtual
environment, sure. However, in the case in question, the mind was lost
(and known to be by the mother) before the kid ever touched said
environment. A valid comparison (rather than the one above) would be
going into a theater, walking improperly on an already broken leg
despite doctor warnings, and trying to blame resulting complications
on the theater...
