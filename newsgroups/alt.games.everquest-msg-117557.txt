    I always used it to "even out" mana regen in the duo. My example: paired
with a druid. He pulls (he can Track), snares, adds one DoT. I put pet on
it, drop Vamp Curse or Heat Blood line depending on my health, Fear it. I'm
keeping up self-buffs, the druid also keeps up regen, SoW etc. The druid is
using mana at the same or a greater pace as me, I get more time to sit, and
I'm running Allure (so I regen mana faster). To keep it so I never have to
wait for the druid I twitch, even if the ratio is garbage. In a situation
like the second I described, where Jazz is doing all the damage dealing and
kiting and you're trying to just avoid aggro, twitching is preferable to
nuking and possibly breaking his quad.

    You don't want to break his quad, do you? =)

    Curious - when with Jazz, what spells do you typically keep up? In my
solo mode I never have space for the nuke, as much as I'd like it. Darkness,
Fear, pet buff, pet heal, Feign, Lifetap, Vamp Curse, Heat Blood line is my
current solo lineup, with pet heal being the swap slot for buffs. I also
pair with a warrior a lot, where pet heal becomes Compact and the pet buff
becomes Screaming Terror (gnomes overpull because they can't see over tall
objects - it's true!) I'm 31 right now - looking forward to VotS, if I can
find a place for it!
