Talking about tracking......

that was one of the things I loved about being a druid, my first in fourteen
characters (druid, that is, not things to love). It still gets me into
trouble though (and I wonder if I will ever learn), like when I took my
first tentative steps off the ledge in FM, coming from LoIO, and decided to
test to see whether that blue mob on track was close enough to snare,
forgetting that it was only on track and not targetted, and you can guess
who was targetted. Which begs the question... can you target what is being
tracked without seeing it? I doubt it. Also, can you cancel tracking without
having to bring up the window and click on the cancel button?
