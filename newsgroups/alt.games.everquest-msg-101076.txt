This is odd, usually so many groups are there you have trouble pulling
ONE HG. You guys must have been the only people in the zone.  Sounds
like you really needed a monk/sk or necro to pull.. or a druid who was
smart enough to zone or gate if it had too many.

FYI though: Hgs suck for xp and their money really sucks now, unless
you like getting a bunch of gold, silver and mostly thousands of
copper pieces.  Velious would be better all around.
