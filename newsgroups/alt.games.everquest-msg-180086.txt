you have to be the moderator or the owner of the channel in order to 
kick someone from the channel.  The moderator is usually set by 
attrition, who ever has been in longest is the next moderator after the 
last one logs off.  The @ symbol before the name is the mod.  The * 
symbol before the name is the owner.  The owner is always a mod even if 
there is one in the channel when you join it that day.
Typing /chat help should come up with a list, if you aren't a mod, you 
may not get the channel moderator commands.  Just make your own channel 
if you want to make sure you get them.
