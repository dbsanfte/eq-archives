Cheer up, it only gets worse at higher lvls.

The obvious one would be to get your wolf boots and drop sow.
Alternately, keep some sow potions handy for those times SoW drops at
a bad time. Also, don't ignore the Malo line of spells if you're going
up against tougher mobs, even if you only use the lowest lvl one.
Makes for a nice pulling spell too since it basically has zero agro
attached. Pull with Mal-x, send in puppy (once you get it), slow, and
you'll usually be able to land a dot too while the mob moves from your
pet to you. 

I'd look at swapping regen and haste too. Neither of those are
must-have spells in the sense that having them drop in the middle of a
fight won't kill you. At higher lvls I basically have 6 spell slots
that never get changed, that makes it even worse. 
1) Malo
2) Damage slot, usually BoN or a rain
3) root (Immobilize)
4) Turgur's
5) Canni
6) rotating buff slot
7) Tnarg's or Kragg's mending
8) Torpor
