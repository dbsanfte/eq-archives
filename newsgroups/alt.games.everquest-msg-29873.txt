I'm pretty sure the best human players do. Besides, the point with Deep
Blue was not the depth at which it would compute, but also the width.
Deep Blue would weight *every* permutation for each of the moves ahead
it was looking at. Human players can actually plan ahead many more moves
than Deep Blue, by dismissing out of hand **apparently** non-productive
move trees.

On the other hand, Kasparov was reportedly freaked out by Deep Blue
following strategies no human player would, for this same reason.

Anyway, my point is that, as far as Chess goes, all our base are belong
to them.
