As I have said many times above, I feel no RAGE at this bizbee. My ranger
friend was the one who was pissed that he was KS'd.  I was just annoyed that
I camped just minutes before the incident occured.  If I hadn't, we would
have had no problem killing the AC as the zone was relatively empty that
night.  You are right to say that it was their word against each others.  I
cant believe my friend would raise a stink about it if he didnt feel he was
in the right.  That and the fact that the warrior GATED to THURG immediatly
after looting the AC lends credibility to the rangers side.  I be thinking
that the warrior was feeling a little...hm... guilty.... hehe



Anyway, I could care less now as when I logged back into SRO tonight, The AC
popped on top of where I appeared, almost before I could turn around and get
my bearings! My ranger friend was by the gypsies and heard my shout in
guildchat, ran over and...the rest is history. Short wait camping the
shadowed men, quick run to the bank and now I'm not so slow anymore ;-)
Quite the bit of luck huh?
