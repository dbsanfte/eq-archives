Hardware is probably not the problem, but drivers may be to blame. It is
testing such that it either works or does not work. Intermittent problems
usually result in complete failure.

Your packet loss could be ISP related, or driver related. Since there seem
to be problems with the drivers I would be suspect. I got a Linksys router
and needed to downgrade the firmware to keep it from LDing me every 15mins
in EQ.

The second problem will be hard to narrow down, but many here have given
great starting points. Just remember bad hardware fails almost immediately,
it wont degrade over time unless it is a heat issue, which could be your
problem.
