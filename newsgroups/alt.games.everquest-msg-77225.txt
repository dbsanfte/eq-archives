Well, I did, of course, register them all as I bought them. The problem is
(and maybe I'm missing the point here -- been known to happen to me before
:) ) that the computer I installed them on is smashed as well. I can turn it
on, but I can't get the hard drive open, and the screen is a jumbled mess of
colors. With the disk smashed, I don't see how I could get the Kunark files
from EQ... unless, as I said, I'm missing something.

thanks!
Darklet
