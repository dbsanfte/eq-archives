I have a lvl 4 Barbarian Beastlord as my alt and am having a blast
playing with him.  I love that you get some low level armour quests
starting right away.  I am now in BB (Black Borrow) to retrieve a
Split Paw Tooth, a Snake Fang, and a Hunting bow.  I have the Split
paw Fang, I can figure out the snake fang, but my question does anyone
know where to get or what drops the hunting bow??

Thanks for any help you guys can provide.
