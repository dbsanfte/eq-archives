I have a dodgy fone line (every minute or 2 it stops sending and receiving
for 10-15 seconds)

I do have cable, but one time when my cable modem died, I continued pulling
using the modem, on a kael arena raid (when the arena was still a big raid
thing for me)..  I've also pulled ST using the modem, and split the princess
house in SG (a pretty tough place to split because of so many casters)

Occasionaly it's got me killed... the main concern though, is missing
messages in the periods of "inactivity".. as a non melee I douibt even that
would be a problem though.
