weight reduction bags, if you cant afford em... just be over weight.

At your level the weight restriction starts comming into play, but its
not an end all be all issue.  I've been way over weight and continue
on driving on with no noticeable issue.

Might I suggest you go to this thread on the Monkly-Buisness and take
a look at the equipment suggestions.

Look at all your equipment and access the weight of it...   I think I
only have 2 items that have a weight of 1 or higher (items being armor
that is, weapons are usually heavier)

here is link for the main forum
http://pub35.ezboard.com/bmonklybusiness43508

but for equipment go here
http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm3

the first two Threads that are Locked are great resource of
information.

Always remember HP is king, then AC...      Weight is a balance factor

Good luck to you and I see your on quellious.  Give Sekani a look up,
that's my monk.
