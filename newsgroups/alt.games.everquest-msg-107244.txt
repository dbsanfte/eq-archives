Ok, I must confess that I am not a Usenet veteran by any means.
Thusfar, I have managed to figure out how to read, post and search.
All of my browsing is done via Groups.Google.com. I know, the purists
thumb their noses at it, but it seems to work ok for me. Just a few
questions though:

1. What is a killfile? If it is a user tool, how is it implemented?
2. Why is it that sometimes I don't see certain postings in a thread,
but others are obviously replying to them?
3. Who the heck is this Bizbee character and why can't I see his posts
sometimes? I see frequent references to him, but nothing from him (at
least in the aforementioned threads which seem to be missing posts
when I view them).

Sorry if these are stupid questions. I promise to only ask them once.
:)
