As VI requested, I ran eqtest.exe, downloaded DX8 and made the appropriate
changes to my eqclient.ini file.

However, when I start the game, I get a small pop-up that tells me 'No 3D
device detected'...

Any idea what I did wrong (or what I need to do to make DX8 work)?

Regards,

OgreLowbie

PS: I reverted back to DX7 in my eqclient file so I could play.
PPS: My video card is an antiquated 8 meg Rush or Banshee (can't remember
which)...
