I don't see how you can say there is ambiguity in EQ.  There is a rule given
in the Play Nice policy, which is enforced if a GM gets involved and is not
a moron.  (OK, big "if" there).  There is another rule given in the code, in
black & white (well...it is probably in color, because most programmers use
editors with syntax highlighting... :-)).  Neither the PN rule nor the rule
given in the code is ambiguous.

(It is kind of dumb that the rule enforced by the server doesn't match the
rule given in the PN policy).

There are player-made rules by which players agree to not exercise their
rights under the PN rules.  For example, back in the days when the Plane of
Hate and Plane of Fear were the uber zones, many servers had a calendar for
those zones.  If your guild wanted to raid there, you picked an open date
and signed up on the calendar, and other guilds would honor that.  Any guild
was free to ignore the calendar and go to the planes, but if they did, they
would find themselves social outcasts, and that was enough of a hardship
that the calendars worked well for quite a while.  However, I don't see any
reason that this sort of player-made ruleset could not also develop in a
game like WoW.  All that seems different from what I've read here is that
WoW's rule matches what the server enforces, and they spell it out for you
(whereas in EQ, it has sometimes been unclear how the server awards the
kill).
