Sure, for themselves. Didn't affect me at at all. Trying to imagine
what it would be like if I were of similar level...nope, I wouldn't be
grouping with them, so still no skin off my nose.

I don't know. It's hard for me to relate, I suppose, since I'm not
close to that level. Maybe it would have an adverse effect on others'
EQ experience. Maybe making the loot on those "trivial" encounters
nodrop would help?
