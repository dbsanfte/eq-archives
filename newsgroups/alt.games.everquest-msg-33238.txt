I've decided to try to pick up a Langsaxe or 2 with my Chanter for my
Warrior.  I get the lion meat from the barbarian village in WK and run it up
to Everfrost.  I cast Benevolence ( sp? ) on Iceberg, he cons amiable, and I
give him the meat.  The bastard doesn't even thank me =)  That's it.
Nothing happens.

Does he need to be a higher faction?  I'm a gnome - should I go turn into a
Barbarian or maybe even a tree first?

I -really- want these axes, and noone is selling them.  I'm aware of the
barb/rogue faction hit I will be taking and have Mammoth Calf hides to take
care of that.

Any help is appreciated.
