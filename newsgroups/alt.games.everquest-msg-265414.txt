Not just you.  Other's on the beta boards are reporting that each poison has 
two uses, each use acting as a 3 minute timed buff.

But, I found the dev post I was thinking of.  Moorgard posted this today:

"Note: There was a data error that affects the use of poisons. Once applied, 
they only last for two minutes, which is not intentional. Applied poisons 
will last twelve hours or one hundred procs of its effect, whichever comes 
first. This bug will be corrected in our next hotfix, and we apologize to 
those of you eager to test them out."
