Well, I can't claim to be a *real* roleplayer in EQ, because I'm much too 
nice to all characters, good and evil alike, but I like feeling good 
about my character's character, so to speak, and I'm very choosy indeed 
about what I kill, independently of whether it gives bad faction or not. 
I've yet to kill a Tizmak, Aviak, Othmir or Centaur, let alone Dwarves.

With that out of the way, I have to say that you can't really apply the 
term "murder" to EQ. The fact that death isn't permanent isn't just a 
gameplay artifact, it has been enshrined in the lore of the game by the 
existence of Soulbinders (try hailing one some time). Although permadeath 
can exist (take Cros Treewind, for example), it's very rare, and both 
adventurers and mobs are presumed to go back to their spawn points, only 
slightly the worse for their ordeal.
