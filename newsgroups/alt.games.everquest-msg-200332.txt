The question is, do you end up at an effective skill of 267, or is the 
skill capped, like tradeskills, at some value between 250 and 255?  Very 
difficult to really prove one way or the other.  With tradeskills, it is 
generally accepted that the cap is either 252 or 254, based on empirical 
data collected on success rates at various skill levels with a skill 
enhancing item.
