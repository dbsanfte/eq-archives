I'm definitely starting to develop the Bizbee attitude toward my fellow
players. I led a group to a camp and saw that there were already a few
people chaotically milling around. Not more than a minute previously I
had called for a camp check and since there were no responses I brought
my group over. In listening to the group already there I could hear that
they were still trying to assemble the rest of their group and didn't
even know who was going to be in it yet. The spawns were popping rapidly
so I developed my group's plan for the attack. I then asked the other
group if they were going to share this camp. No response. They ignored
me. Fuck it, my group went into action. Apparently the other group
didn't want to play very well because they left. Oh well. Their loss.
Unfortunately I was saddled with a loose cannon enchanter. We killed a
lot of mobs but he didn't understand that when we were hurting and out
of healing mana we needed to stop for a minute. He would fucking run up
to the mobs and aggro 2 or 3 at a time and get himself killed and wonder
why. He would lead the mobs that were chasing him to the other end of
the zone and wonder why we weren't following trying to keep him alive.
Moron. On one of his corpse recoveries he was gone for quite a while so
I asked him where he was. He said that he was sitting at the other end
of the zone because no one was helping him stay alive. I said,
"Bullshit. You brought it upon yourself. Don't think that we're going to
risk ourselves over here while you sit over there and get xp." He said
that we were just sitting around, not killing things fast enough. This
was after I took on 4 of the mobs alone while the cleric was healing me
and he was running away. And yet one of the group members still couldn't
understand why me and the others wanted to kick him out. In fact he
tried to justify the enchanter's actions. Moron.
