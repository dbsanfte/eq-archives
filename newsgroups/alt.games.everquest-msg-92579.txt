Thanks for all the posts everyone, you have given a lot of good advice. The
reason I am looking for some other weapons for my monk is just cause I need
to work on the other skills.
Valien, do you mind directing me to where I could find some more information
about that quest you mentioned?
Thanks again everyone
Chaos
