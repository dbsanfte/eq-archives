To my view, the only "weak and whiney" I've seen so far
have been some high-level players who whine, "if I
had to suffer needlessly through poor game design,
then dammit, every else should have to also".

It's like the high-level hybrids who screamed when the
hybrid experience penalty was removed, on the grounds
that since they had leveled up under an oppressive,
unwarranted 40% experience penalty, then so should
everyone who came after them.

Me, I'm just happy they're fixing some things that
I've always known were bad ideas to have in the game
in the first place, even though I'm already past the
point where I myself could get much use out of them.

People need to learn the difference between "now it'll
be too easy" (no, actually, it won't) and "now some
things will be less of an inexcusable pain in the ass".

The former would be bad.  The latter is good.
