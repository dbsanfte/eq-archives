Many people are gonna flame me for this. I don't care it deserves
saying. Let me buff up with some fire resistance.

YWNEMS begins to cast a spell.
YWNEMS is resistant to flames.

Don't reply, you should not "Cast your pearls before swine". You are
bumping thier posts and they reply to keep them bumping up for
newreaders that support bumping.

They take a germ of truth and make it into an agenda, dont' get mad.
Get even. Ignore them. Who has not been singled out because of thier
race in a neighborhood? Heck I get singled out because I am Catholic
in rural ares here.

The whole "Hate Crimes" thing that Clinton championed energized and
motivated the people it was to single out. We respond too quickly to
the silly minority opinion in this nation, instead of the consensus of
the people. Ignore them publicly, but make fun of them privatly.

I used humor once but I didn't reply directly. Make a new thread if
you must reply. Change the topic.

Reporting them with thier ISP is useless, use SPAMCOP. Eventually
somone will decide to put the usenet death penality if a third party
is involved.
