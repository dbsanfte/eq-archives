I found that it did work, but it definitely didn't work the very first 
time I tried it, since it tried to insist on a full-screen mode that 
resulted in crashing.  Once I got it to work, and had doublechecked the 
options, it did use that resolution.  And since I didn't then switch back 
to full-screen, I really can't speak to that. :)

Heh, it worked for a bit.  Now it doesn't work again.  But then, I wasn't 
able to do EQtest-EQW and EQ-EQW before, so that's not really a change. :)

}Well, I must say I'm disappointed.  If you're gonna refuse to argue

It works flawlessly!  Verant uber alles!  Even the software they upload to 
test is perfectly bug-free and provides all the utility and features I 
could ever need!

How's that? :)
