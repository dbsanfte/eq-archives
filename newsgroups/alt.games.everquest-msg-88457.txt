I wouldnt have gone up and pulled from a camp that was obviously camped. The
fact that they wernt taking all the spawns immediately would be some
justification for some to pull, but I would just ask "You gonna pull those
orcs?".
As for "helping" someone whos being chased by a mob... dont. 99.9% of the
time they will be pulling in the 20+ zones. EC I guess you have to make your
mind up at the time... a lot of newbies there who dont know (yet) about
yell. Ill usually stand in front of them for a while, and give them a chance
to ask if they need it.
