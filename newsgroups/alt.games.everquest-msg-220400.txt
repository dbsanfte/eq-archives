While I'm sure SoE has put maximizing the bottom line highest on its 
list of priorities, I'm not convinced ZEMs are used to move expansions.

New quests, new zones, and new mobs, new features, and above all else... 
new better mobs are already significant draws for the expansions.

I have yet to meet someone that said, "The biggest reason I bought 
Luclin was to level my lowbie characters faster in zones like PC". Hell 
I have yet to meet someone that mentioned ZEMs at all as a purchase 
decision factor... it doesn't even register as a blip on the radar in my 
experience.

Furthermore, SoE is pretty quiet about ZEMs... if they wanted you to buy 
LDoN (or any other expansion) for the ZEMs they'd be sure to list that 
as a selling point.
