Dang, I missed that thread. I'll have to look for it.

When I first started playing my brother PL'd me. He led my level 4 dwarf warrior 
further out than I had ever been, pointed at Corflunk and said "Kill that".

Absolutely correct. I personally consider EQ weddings to be silly, maybe unless
the participants are spouses/lovers in RL. But they still have a right to play the
game they wish without being disturbed by inconsiderate idiots. Of course, had 
the original complaint been that they were upset about all the chatter from others
around them, well there's always the chat filter. I believe that was someone else's
problem a couple of weeks ago: a wedding party was upset that he had /ooc'd
a camp check.

And I believe the phrase "digging a deeper hole" currently applies.
