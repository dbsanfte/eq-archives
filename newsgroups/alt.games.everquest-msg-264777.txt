It works exactly as it does in CoH. Before you enter the zone you are 
offered a choice of which instance you want to enter. Groups enroute to a 
particular zone within the instanced zone (like a mission in CoH or a 
dungeon like Blackburrow in EQ2) can ignore this and head for destination 
knowing that they'll all wind up in the same place, or they can say 
"everyone meet in Antonica2". Same deal, with the same drawbacks.
