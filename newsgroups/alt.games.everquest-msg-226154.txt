There are a variety of ways this could be done.  Most likely, a shaman 
or beastlord grouped with him and cast Shrink on him.  Another 
possibility would be that he used an Ant potion.

I'm surprised though, that either would work on a halfling, which is a 
small race to begin with, though not as small as gnomes.

Are you sure you didn't see Nillipus, a brownie who runs around 
Rivervale?  He's really tiny, as are the brownies of LFay etc.

Splendid
