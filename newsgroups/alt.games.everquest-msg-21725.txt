I know exactly what you mean.  I had a guy SERIOUSLY ask me for 15 platinum
so he could equip his character.  I asked him his level and class and he
replied 5 Paladin.  Wanting to be a supporter of good and justice i was
considering the offer but with the usual speach of how items are more
respected if they are earned with sweat and tears rather than being handed
to him.  It was then for some reason i decided to see who was in the zone
and there was Mr. Dinky who turned out to be a level 2 Paladin.

Needless to say not only did he earn a spot on ignore, he got one hell of a
lecture and some public humiliation...
