Wow, just priced '63 Vettes, and it was about double what I thought.  I 
also dunno if the Vette would  be more fun to drive... I'd get tired of 
the penis jokes awfully quick.  But then, my -ideal- car for drivability 
is a 145 Volvo station wagon from the early 70's, so perhaps I have odd 
tastes. :)  I love the tight turning radius on a long car, and the 
feeling of the momentum.  I guess it's like the difference between 
the joy of skipping a pebble way across the river, and throwing a big 
tremendous rock in and making a big sploosh. :) Hmm.  Actually, I remember 
a late 60's Datsun Roadster that was a lot of fun, too, but that's 
probably mostly because I got to drive it when I was 11. :)
