Taunt wise, the best weapons are the two fastest.  At all levels.   If one of
the weapons has a proc effect, that helps a lot too.

Damage wise though, there is a difference. At level 13, it doesn't matter
much, but past the mid 20's, you will get a level based damage bonus to each
hit with your primary hand only.   Putting the fastest weapon in that hand
will increase the number of times that you get the bonus, and increase your
overall damage, even if the ratio isn't quite as good.  The higher level you
are, the more pronounced this effect is.    The offhand does not get a damage
bonus, so the most damaging weapon for your offhand is the one with the best
ratio.

That 20 ac belt in Maidens drops off level 54 to 58 mobs, is very, very no
drop.

The group would probably have to be pretty good friends with you to allow you
to park your twink there to loot one that dropped.   And even then I at least
would insist on calling in guild members and friends to loot them first, with
a vast preference for rangers and rogues.    The two classes that benefit most
from it.   And I would click the destroy button on it myself before giving it
to some idiot twink that was spamming the zone begging for drops.
