AHAHA if anyone said "WHO?" when mentioning Tolkien or halvlings and
they were involved in any kind of fantasy game I could never talk to
them again. Tolkien wrote a fantasy book when there pretty much was no
such genre (at least not what we call fantasy today), especially not a
multi book epic trilogy one. Its like if someone is talking about
Christmas and says "Jesus is the reason for the season"; Tolkien could
be called the reason for all of this.
