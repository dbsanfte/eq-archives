Google swings per tic should be in the first couple hits. Something on 
"rpgexpert". One of the guides...of which most are very dubious in 
quality... but still... there is the odd tidbit... the tribute value 
chart is handy ;)

Their is no doubt that their will be -some- fixed temporal granularity 
that the game engine is updated on... (Weapon delay data seems to 
suggest 1/10th.) Its much closer to real time than the gross granularity 
of a tic, but I'm fairly convinced many effects actually -occur- on tic 
boundaries, and are not merely -reported- on tic boundaries.

Speaking as a programmer: for effects that only go off 'once per tic' 
(e.g. dots) it makes sense to evaluate all of them every 60 cycles (60 
1/10th seconds) instead of dealing with them 'in-realtime'. Which is why 
two dots even if cast 1.5 seconds apart appear to always impact at the 
same instant. (Indeed you can land 2+ dots on a mezzed mob before it 
wakes up, and *that* is no 'visual artifact' even if you argue that its 
health bar is.

> and hp in realtime. 

As far as the server tracking hp and mana in realtime... this is 
obviously true to a point, we receive heals and take damage more or less 
instantaneously (at least within the 1/10th second granularity), but I 
wouldn't be surprised if regen is lumped in with the dot evaluation, and 
done only once every 60 'cycles'

> This means the tick has no gameplay affect at all,

I played a bard for a -long- time, and I'm convinced of its effect on 
several aspects of gameplay. 

Mez duration for example... Mezzes *always* wore off at tic intervals, 
and two mezzes chain cast (within the same tic) often broke 
*simultaneously* indicating that they expired at the tic boundary, and 
not in 18 seconds realtime. This was not a 'visual artifact'. There was 
no 'reporting delay' Both mobs were still, and then both were NOT still. 
There is simply no credibility to claiming the mob was busting my chops 
for up to 5 seconds serverside while my client blithely thought it was 
still sleeping.

Similiarly when I was 5 twisting. I noticed some buffs simply never 
lasted a full cycle while others reliably did. (It appears some are 
coded to last 'at least 18 seconds' running 3 tic boundaries, while 
others are coded to last 'up to 18 seconds' running only 2 tic 
boundaries (the lower level resists in particular I recall are like 
this, routinly only lasting 13-15 seconds). I also noticed buffs 
routinely wore off *simultaneously* instead of in real time, and this 
again was not simply 'a visual artifact'. I concede Stat/resist buffs 
are difficult to prove because you can argue that the client updates of 
my stats are simply synced to the icon dropping, but that serverside my 
+20vsM actually ran out 3.4 seconds ago... However... consider damage 
shields... these wear off at the tic mark just like any other bard buff, 
and you can monitor its up/not up by observing the damage taking place 
on the mob until the instant it drops, and then stopping. There is never 
a 3 second lag between the mob not taking ds damage and the ds icon 
dropping.

I must admit, that while I don't personally engage in this level of 
minmaxxing, I did test it at one point, and I was satisfied that it 
worked.

I have also experienced the mob aggro effect, where sometimes if moving 
fast I can run right through a mob and not aggro it... suggesting that 
aggro checks are not performed every 1/10 second cycle, but are also 
performed only periodically.

At any rate. I agree that the 'swings per tic' theory this guy was 
presesenting as fact is pretty far fetched, and agree that it is 
unlikely to be true. But I still wanted to verify. Farfetched and 
unlikely aren't good indicators of (un)reality in EQ :)
