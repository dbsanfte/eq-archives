Melee's aren't much better...if you've powerquested to 30th level... 

Kick is at 5, 1hs is at 9, dodge is at 17, taunt is at 2, offense is
6... 

And your toon is a waste of space that shouldn't be imposed on
anybody, especially innocent bystanding groupmates.

Hell even at 16th if your skills are in their teens you've got real
problems contributing to your group. You can't hold taunt, you cant
deal damage... your just a meatsack, useful only as an offtank for
parking adds. Virtually useless.
