Nah, you've got the equally pernicious inverse.  You don't give a
flying fuck about anybody else just so long as you get to play in
god-mode.

I do still think that you're behaving like a self-absorbed twit,
willfully incapable of comprehending even the basics of concepts
like play balance in a multiplayer game.  And I don't give a damn
whether or not you STFU, you can go on spouting your childish
bullshit as long as it pleases you.  As for comparing playing a
character in a simplistic video adventure to reality... get a
grip willya? once you've played a few classes for a few years it
just isn't difficult to relate to the play situation of other
characters.  There just isn't any comparison at all between trying
to understand a human being who lives in even half-way foreign
circumstances.  You've become so absorbed in your own self-pitying
melodrama that you've lost all sense of proportion here.

The only thing showing here is your pathetic comparison of a
simplistic game environment to the far more complex challenges
of real life and your apparent lack of ability to distinguish
the two.

Get out into the sunshine and fresh air brother, video game
drama queens are a dime a dozen and overpriced at that.
