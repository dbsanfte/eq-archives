They are much needed in higher levels.

I dont know =p

There are no exp penalties anymore I think.

MOST DEFINATLY!! They deal huge ammounts of damage I am told at higher
levels. They can move themselves down on the hate list in a matter of a few
seconds (if hide works that is)
> Shadowknight - The idea is interesting, but apparently their xp

Dunno =p

I think wizards aren't needed for anything but ports (heh sorry) and lore
spells when you get 50+
