That would be Turning of the Unnatural, and it's actually a level 39
spell, IIRC.

Spells drop off of mobs of that level, IIRC.  The ones you're killing have
at
least a potential of being level 39.   As a guess, it's the wurms in GD.
Those also drop a couple of druid spells, Fixation of Ro being one.  They
also drop Celestial Healing, a level 44 cleric spell.

At any rate, if you want low 50's spells, you have to kill mobs that can
be low-50's.
