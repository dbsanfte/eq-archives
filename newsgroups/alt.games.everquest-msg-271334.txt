http://www.gry-online.pl/eq2/index.asp should give you a good idea but 
the jist is;

Everfrost
Lavastorm
Enchanted Lands
Zek
Feerott

Added to Antonica and Freeport's island which you also mentioned. All 
these have numerous zones in the same way Antonica does.

They changed the gameplay drastically and added new game areas with each 
one. Legacy of Ykesha even added a whole new race, and moved the home 
city of another race elsewhere to make space for them. They also added 
Kunark and Velious, other islands, the moon of Luclin (which you can see 
in EQ2...it's the one that was destroyed and has the impressive rings 
around it from the debris) and the Planes of Power, along with the Lost 
Dungeons.

Like I said the gameplay was drastically changed. Lots of little things 
(which eventually added up to changing pretty much everything) but the 
one I always remember is the Plane of Knowledge, which added a quick 
portal system from almost every zone (not just land, like the Mariner's 
Bells in EQ2 do, but zone) which cut down travel times to seconds.

How do you mean, Qeynos main city? That is full accessible as far as I 
know, although I believe you can't enter the castle yet. Qeynos consists 
of the suburbs, then North, South and the Docks, much as it did in EQ1.
