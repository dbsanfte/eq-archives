Lol, I haven't played my bard in ages - but

They added a keyboard command to toggle your
last two targets.

So, charm your pet, get him beaten down, break
charm:

Now you have a choice, charm a new pet to kill
him and lose some xp to the recent charm changes,
or chant your pet down.

If you decide on the first, simply charm another
mob, and hit the toggle key to get your old pet
back and hit /pet attack

I can't remember what that key defaults to, but 
you can go into options, keyboard, general (I think)
and see/change it.
