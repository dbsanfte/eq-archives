I did an LDON last night with six people.  I was 56 (Enchanter), and the
other five were 50-53.  We took a regular Mistmoore slaughter--the guildmate
I was with, neither of us have ever failed a slaughter.  Two Paladins, two
Druids, one Enchanter, and one Ranger.

Sounds easy, right?

We failed.  Totally.  We even failed the overtime.  We didn't even halfway
make it.

We had one wipe out, because no one realized there was a barrel in the room
and I used AE mez.  (Which I used because a bitten victim had been
accidentally woken and turned into spiders.)   Even with that though, you'd
think we'd do better--we finish most slaughters in just an hour or so.

Everyone was doing their job, no one was slacking or screwing up.  Everyone
was assisting, mezzes and debuffs were landing fine, no more resists than
usual.  Heals were a-plenty thanks to KEI and C2, I was able to nuke a
little more thanks to Cleric pac.  We were all on the ball and nailed every
mob we touched...  But the dungeon was just stronger than we were.  It was
taking the mobs a long time to die, longer than usual--up to 2 minutes to
die each it seemed (I didn't time them, but it took a loooooooong time),
even with three hasted tanks (and sometimes my pet) banging on them, and no
other mobs healing them

I know that the Slaughter mobs are harder, but that was just ridiculous.

Could it have been that my level skewed the mob levels somehow?  They were
all blue to me, but the rest of the group was saying they were blue, yellow
and white.  Or was it just bad luck?
