BTW, in regard to those logs, a friend of mine had a bone runed fork
(something like that) in her range slot, and , yes, she accidentally threw
it.  She petitioned, and they evenutally came back and told her they would
not restore the item, as she had destroyed it.  Their logs evidently showed
that she had purposely destroyed it with the destroy button.  Maybe she was
lying to me, but seems kind of unlikely that she did that.
