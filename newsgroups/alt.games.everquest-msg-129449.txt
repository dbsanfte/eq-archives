Give me details on the former and I'll research it.  As to the latter,
simply because the Israelis didn't let the loony journalists in,
doesn't mean it was terrorism.  As to all the deaths, I would wager
that the vast majority of them were combatants...

The Palestinians can stop it ANYTIME, if they so choose to..
