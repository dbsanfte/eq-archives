Sounds like the idiot I got two days ago in Ill Omen, called asking for a
port and offering 20pp for a ride to WC.  When he said he was level 4 I told
him to wait a few levels, but he insisted on going anyway so I told him to
meet me at the stream on the way to FV.  To make a long story short he died
going up the stream to a fish that was stranded on land.  I found his body
and nearly died when the corrupted Barracuda attacked me, but managed to get
away from it and log to another character.  I then got back into contact
with him and he had gotten a res but the cleric could not find his body. I
found it for him and escorted the cleric to it then got my druid.  At that
point he told me he had no more money but would have his alt. pay me and
would I please port him to WC anyway, for he had an expensive robe to sell.
I sowed, camoed and ported him and he ran on to EC.  Last I heard he was
selling, and I still have not been paid even though I nearly died helping
him and wasted nearly a half hour of my time getting him to WC.   I am not
that worried though as he is a lvl 4 iskar monk with no way of getting
enough faction to get back home and a high chance of dying and loosing
everything to a rotten corpse before he hits lvl 5.  My personal hope is he
buys a port to the DLs and tries to run it in wolf form and meets the
dragon.  If so there would be some justice in Norrath.
