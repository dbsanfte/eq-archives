The first is the ping time - round trip in milliseconds between your
computer and the server. This tells you how fast your connection is.
Linkdeath does not occur when this figure goes red - I've had it say 18000
before now. Odd seeing spells I cast that long ago suddenly fire off.

The next two are packet loss percentages, received & sent respectively. This
tells you how good the connection is - any losses are bad, but not usually
fatal, and it gives you an idea how good your ISP is. 100% packet loss for
10 seconds gives you linkdeath (possibly only the 'received' figure).

The fourth is packet size. This gives you an indication of how much data is
arriving - this goes up during heavy loads and can cause linkdeath if the
number goes into the red because there's too much information to give you.
Data backlog is bad for your character's health. Think large raids, or lots
of fast melee, or being in EC tunnel at peak time. You get the idea.
