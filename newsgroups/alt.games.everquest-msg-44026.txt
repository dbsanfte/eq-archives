Might be different on different servers. Don't know for sure. We spent
several levels there. When we were the only ones in the zone, sure, we
camped the entry area, bridge, and balcony spawns. When that was taken,
we'd set up at the stables or the temple. I saw groups in several areas
on many occasions.
  But I'll agree that it's pretty much a byog zone, as many remote and
dangerous ones are. Not a lot of walk-through single player traffic
there. But hey, to this day that's still one of my favorite zones.
