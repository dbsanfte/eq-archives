Where did you find 73 of those damned Giant Field Rats? I have been
running around Qeynos Hills for hours and have only found a handfull..
Oh and us Rangers and druids also have to share the Giant Field Rats
with the necromancers.. I don't mind that the rats are rare but when 3
classes need them for the quest then I think that it is a bit strange
that they don't drop the pelt and whiskers some more often..
