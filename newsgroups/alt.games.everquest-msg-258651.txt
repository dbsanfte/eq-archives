However, you can make the Track window really small.  On my bard, I tied Track
to a turn arrow, reduced the Track window to where you can't read anything on
it (maybe 20 pixels high or so) and shoved it off to the edge of the screen
somewhere.  Now, for the cost of a small amout of screen area, I'm getting
Track skillups "automatically".  If I actually want to Track something, I just
drag open the window to a larger size.
