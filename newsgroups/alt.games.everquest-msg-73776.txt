That's quite wrong. It depends. If the TSA buff brings your melee > 100 STA
and he has a heavy weapon, it has a substantial influence when he runs out
of stamina. A higher level Shaman (49+) can add about 120 points to STR
and DEX. Now ask any melee with a proccing weapon on if he thinks the
120 DEX more are not substantial. Or a caster, when 120 more DEX helped
evading a mob while casting .. mez or healer. If we're talking about the
difference between 150 and 160 STR, you are right.

: are bad. The shaman group would be missing what the druid can do A LOT

Might be a playstyle I don't know .. but I normally camp the same
place for exp for 4-6 hours nonstop. I rarely port around. What
exactly is it the druid provides, that is so important for
ongoing 6 hours of exp grinding? I don't know much about a druids
grouping capabilities apart from healing .. what are they, apart
from specialized camps that need harmony.

: while the druid group might be only saying that a shaman would have

Like in every dungeon, where a shaman outperforms a druid by far? :)
Ask melees on if they want to give up haste as well.
