Another thing you can might be able to do is to Charm the NPC and send it
to attack a higher level NPC. The Charmee gets killed without you taking
any faction hits, and you gate/zone/whatever so the higher level NPC won't
come after you. Then you just wait for the ex-out-of-position NPC to
respawn.
