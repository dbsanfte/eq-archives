Heh. That's the one that bugs me.

"What should I be hunting?"
"dorfs!!11!1!!!"
"Umm... I do kinda RP a good character and don't really want to hose
my faction with Kaladim"
"lol!1!! looser they r good xpz fuk ur stoopid rp"

Okay, usually not so l33t-laden, but still... Where to hunt questions
usually turn back "xxx Guards!". Umm, sorry. I don't wanna end up like
one of my guildies. He's a wood elf ranger that's KOS just about
everywhere. (He's even dropping faction in Kelethin and Felwithe
somehow...)
