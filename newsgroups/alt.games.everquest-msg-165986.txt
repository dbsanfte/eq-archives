Here's an answer from the Microsoft.public.windowsxp.games forum that
similar to what you are asking...

_______________________________

Basic response is:  They can't in Windows XP Home.  The Pro edition is more
flexible in allowing an Administrator account to authorize Limited accounts
access to only certain files or certain programs.  Details of the accounts
are here:

/windowsxp/home/using/productdoc/en/UA_c_Account_Types.asp
There is also a very good over-view article which includes information on
troubleshooting games here:
