The best book to read about Rider-Waite is Waite
himself, though he can be hard to digest. He was
a member of the GD, and his accompanying book The
Pictorial Key to the Tarot, is written in such a
way, as to not break the vows he undertook.
Nevertheless it is an absolute must for
understanding his deck.

To understand the Qabalistic symbolism of the
Rider-Waite deck, and also compare the deck to the
Thoth, Golden Dawn, and Marseilles Tarot decks,
Robert Wang's Qabalistic Tarot is an excellent
starting point.

Some of my friends recommend Eden Gray's books
such as Mastering the Tarot, for Rider-Waite,
though I have no real opinion on the books.

If you want to learn about the Thoth deck, stay
far away from Angeles Arrien. She appears to have
no interest in what AC actually said about his
deck.

The Book of Thoth by AC is essential to
understanding his deck, though once again, hard to
understand for a beginner (and anyone else, for
that matter).

Israel Regardie's book, The Golden Dawn, gives a
good background to the symbolism contained in the
Thoth deck, as well as providing practical
examples of magickal workings with the cards. (The
Lesser Banishing Ritual contained therein, may be
of some interest to you.)

Anything by Dion Fortune, Paul Foster Case, or AC
himself, is likely to further understanding of
both decks.

You may wonder why I am so vehemently against
Angeles Arrien and other, similar, post-modern
Tarot "experts". My approach to Tarot can be
summed up at this website;
http://www.jktarot.com

The FAQ in particular should be a prerequisite for
anyone studying Tarot.

Good luck.
