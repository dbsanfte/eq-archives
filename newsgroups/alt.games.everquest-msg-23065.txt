Off on a side-track here, but I've always believed charging for
"looting rights" was tacky. If it's something you're not gonna use and
it's nodrop, let whoever wants it take it. What're you going to do if
they don't pay up, destroy it or let it rot on the corpse? You don't
make anything that way... If they freely give you the money without
being asked, fine. But saying "10k to look this ring before I destroy
it" is just assinine.
