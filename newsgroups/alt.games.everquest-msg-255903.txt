The Berserker community have started a revolt on the EQ live boards. In
part this is because they have had only 2 fixes to their class since it
went live 7 months ago and no new content (including class AAs and
eight other fixes including the very sad Warcry line).

Messages of support would be welcome by the berserkers on the EQlive
board, if they don't delete them .. so far 2 major poll type posts have
been deleted by the CSRs.

A further support board has been setup here:

A short post of support in either, or both, locations would be
appreciated by the berserker community.

regards
