When my bard upgraded from a Walrus Skin Drum to a Thunderous Drum of
Karana, I went from 67 to 75 damage/tick from Chant of Frost, Chant of
Disease, and Chant of Poison (my usual kiting twist).  This translates to
going from 201 damage/tick to 225 damage/tick.  Is 24 damage/tick worth 6K?
(On Xegony, Walrus Skin is worth about 500, Thunders about 6500).  That's up
to you to decide, of course; I got my TDK as a drop in a BoT group.  :)
