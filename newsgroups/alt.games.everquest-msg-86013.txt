I thought of that too.. but consider this.  Many people already buy EQ items
at auction sites for real money.  Verant has stated publicly that they hate
this practice.  But what if they use the fact that SOME people do that to
this advantage.  I'm not saying that every "Uber" item would become no drop
and would cost money in game.  But what if one day you killed the Orc
Trainer and he was carrying a 20 slot, 50% weight reduction bag.  No drop.
Now lets say you have to pay $1 for it.  You may not do it, I may not.. but
I'm willing to bet SOMEONE would.  It would not surprise me if one day
verant makes a server like this.  Why not?  Make it one server, no transfers
to it.  Make everyone start fresh.  Examine playerauctions.com.  Like $150
for some items and people buy it.  Now what if it dropped in game on a
lesser mob and Verant charged $2 for it.  I'm not saying its a good idea, or
that it's GONNA happen.. but I'm willing to bet the idea has been discussed.
