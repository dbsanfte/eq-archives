What did you expect??

A cushy nice soft life as a spell caster? When you are one who thrives on
other's suffering, death and destruction,
who digs out the remains of dead and animates them to serve as his slaves,
performing rituals
few races can have any acceptance of. Apart from the Dark Elves with their
innate hatred for
 lesser races (which covers about all the others), most races where
necromancy is practiced
do not really like it but accept it, look the other way, and let the
practitioners of the dark arts hide away in
secluded parts of their cities.

Accept your dark path and live the part of one who is above all living and
dead.
You have the power to dominate them and rule them even beyond the grave.
There is no escaping
a necromancer. When your foes fall to your power they will serve you as
slaves reanimated from their bones.

/ Tarion, Dark Elven Necromancer of the 4:th Circle, follower of our lord
Innoruk.
