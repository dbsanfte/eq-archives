I am a 27 year old e-business developer and fully understand network
administration. I realize this isn't mission critical banking software. It's
a game. But all it takes is a little coordination and some redundancy --
which isn't that expensive considering the cost of servers is probably 1% of
their expenses.

The fact is, too many of their customers think like you and don't mind the
inconveniences of these preventable outages. You fully support it, so you
give them no reason to get up off their asses anymore than they need to.
It's *always* easier just to bring the servers down.

As a former ISP admin, I know this all too well. We had 0% loss of our
client base when we brought servers down. We were a small ISP, so we didn't
bother spending the extra $3000 for redundant (backup) servers.
