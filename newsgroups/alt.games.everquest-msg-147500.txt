Hear, hear... Id like to concur with Taras.... Well said.

I don't necessarily agree with all you said, but I do understand.
I was in the military. US Army.  No, not as decorated as you, nor as
long served.  But I do understand the brother in arms, and the loss.

May your head always be held High.  You KNOW, what you have done for
your country, others do not.  Do not let them make you feel you need
to justify you career.

Good hunting, and peace to your pain.
