Nope, Quillmane isn't very rare, you'll see him several times
a day if you hang out at the gnoll spires with track skill.

Whats rare is for him to drop his cloak.  Also whats rare
for him is a lifespan over 60 seconds.

Note I said "see him on track" because actually racing
over to lay eyes on him isn't nearly as likely to work out...
maybe you can have a peak at his body before it gets
looted.
