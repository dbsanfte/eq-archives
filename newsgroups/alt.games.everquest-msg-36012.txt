And as I found out recently, you can transfer a character on your
account, complete with all its gear and stuff, on to another account
on your same server for the same cost.. 50 bucks. That is not really
all that bad. Also if you have more than one you can transfer two
completely geared characters from your own account to a new account on
the same server for 75 bucks.

The only stipulation I think was that both accounts be nearly the
same, same name, same address, same credit card, etc (to transfer from
one account to a new one on the same server)
