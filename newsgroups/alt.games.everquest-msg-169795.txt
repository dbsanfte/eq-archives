 HoH trials are seriously messed up. They shouldn't be that easy to
poof.


 We are starting to get flagged up for Bertox and killed Carprin but
then no mobs spawned afterwards so I guess we blew it unknowingly. What
order are mobs supposed to be killed in? Or is that 'leet nfo'? I don't
mind talking to NPCs to find these thigs out so if one of them mentions
it just direct me that way. From the NPCs in PoT that I've talked to,
none of them seem to give any mention of order. I don't mind
progressions to things when they actually make sense but leaving things
like this to random chance seems a bit lame to me. All these flags are
starting to piss me off. 


 We haven't been able to get to Behemoth yet. He's never around. Nice to
know now to pull him outside the room though since I know someone will
end up suggesting it.
