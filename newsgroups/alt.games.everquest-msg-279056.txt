HEAT HEAT, sounds like a heat problem to me.
Happened to about 8 months back, took the side of the case off, and 
positioned a house type fan pointing inside. Worked a treat, so fitted 
additional fan inside.

Not a problem for 7 months and 2 weeks, then same symptons.....
Opened case, fans and heat sink full of dust. Soft brush, delicate use of a 
hoover, dust gone, heat problem gone.

My moneys on heat.
