Unless you can see invis, you won't be able to see anybody who is 
successfully hiding.  You also have yourself so convinced that you are the 
world's greatest at hiding that you won't be able to see yourself 
regardless of success or failure.

Sneak is useful when dealing with otherwise uncooperative merchants, and is 
a shortcut to faction work for some quests (quests where you only have to 
be indifferent).

Hide is useful when you want to go AFK in a hostile area and can't trust 
camo to hold the entire time.
