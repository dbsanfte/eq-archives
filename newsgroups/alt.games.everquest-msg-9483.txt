Some good points,
It arises the age old question of "What is roleplaying"
I think verant has an exceedingly hard stance on this topic, I read their
harassment terms somewhere and it is to the point where you cant even
roleplay venting your anger without getting banned.
Personally I think that one should be allowed to use profanity in regular
talk mode but NOt in shout or OOC. That way you are only subjecting it to
those around you who have the option to walk away. Ooc is subjecting
unnessecary parties into an argument. Sending profanity over a tell is also
not roleplay, if that person isnt there, they obviously dont wanna hear what
you have to say.
It would allow those who wanted to argue and figh to stay and do so whilst
not subjecting others.

That would clear up any questions of weather you are roleplaying or not.

As for telling people to shoot themselves, well.
Maybe you need to calm down a bit.
It is only a game.

I would feel the same frustration as you if i had put so much time into my
charachter but maybe it was unwise to put yourself into that situation in
the first place. The rukes are clear.

Personally I prefer to patronize and belittle people who annoy me. I can
almost derail any situation like that without using profanity. Its just a
question of composure.
