One of my RL friend tried that, got 30pp in 90 min of only porting and
auctioning for it. People usually told him AFTER the port that they had no
money.
Dont know how it is on other servers, but on Veshaan i would not consider
porting for donations, i either port for free if i feel like it, or for cash.
