"It's ok to inspect what this person is wearing, despite the fact that it's
really none of my business without the owner's permission...because Verant
says it's ok," has never held much water for me.

"It is because it is."  Same thing, far fewer words.

th, has anyone come up with any sort of halfway reasonable reason why
inspection can't be by consent only (beyond the coding issues over a
relatively minor issue when an expansion is still being tested & written)?
I'm afraid I can't read much of this thread without getting angry, and
considering it's a damned stupid topic to get that angry over I'm avoiding
most of it.
