Oh, those are fun. You should see alt.religion.wicca. The Christian
zealots who pop in there to tell us how we're all gonne burn in hell,
and how we're all horrible monsters, then never bother to see what us
horrible monsters have to say about it. Couple weeks reading that
group and those trolls did exactly the opposite of what the
Bible-thumpers hoped to accomplish - it reaffirmed in my mind that I
had made the right decision. I mean, I understand and readily admit
there are GOOD Christians out there. But I've seen too many ministers
telling kids that they shouldn't associate with non-Christians unless
they were trying to "save" them, because non-Christians are the spawn
of Satan... Top that with a Catholic priest informing a friend of mine
that "It's never rape in the marriage bed"...
