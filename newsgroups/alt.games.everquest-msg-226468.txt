Yes, because locate corpse will certainly get me a group, especially in PoP
or LDoN.
FD pulling is now, in general, a (very) poor second to lull-pulling and
lifetaps (barring two at 60+) are not that great.

If SOE do what you ask, SKs will go back to their old pre-PoP role - lying
feigned in a corner waiting for knight loot to drop on raids, and sitting
LFG for everything else.

Interesting. How very 'Holy Trinity/Kunark Era' of you. SOE spent pretty
much the last, what, four? five? expansions getting away from that, and with
good reason.
And rangers shouldn't be competing with warriors, they should be competing
with rogues and monks - you're a DPS class that does a little tanking on the
side.
