Oops... Did I give the illusion of having had a point?  Sorry.  Didn't 
mean to do that. :)

Well, no, I did have a point, maybe.  But I posted that more because it 
sounded funny.  

It would seem more likely, though, that in the year 40,000 CE or so, we 
might figure out that the Andromeda Galaxy -is- God.  Or maybe Orion, or 
something.

"If there is a God, why haven't we found him yet?" sounds a rather shallow 
view from a species that's only a few million years old and hasn't even 
left its home system, though.
