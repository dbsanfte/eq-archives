BIG Difference between server crashing, and *you* going link dead.

I know it sucks, but you can't really expect a Guide/GM to know exactly when
you went LD.

When Prexus was crashing, there were multiple GM's in Temple of Veeshan as
soon as the servers came back up, just to help with summons and rezzes.
People who lost items were reimbursed (tho some did lose a few AA levels)

The difference is, the crashes were provable, and the gm's were aware of
them. Yelling "WTF the servers suck, I want my fuckin epic back u fgt gm"
isn't going to help ur chances, nor is it going to convince anybody to help
you :)

Email the facts... be polite.. you never know
