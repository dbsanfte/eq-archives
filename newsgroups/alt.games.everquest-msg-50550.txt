Don't apologize ... I feel the same way.  I barely have time to play EQ as
it is.  I'm sure as hell not going to jump onto DAoC, NWN, and/or anything
else right now.  Hell's bells, I've played the C&C/RA games since their
inception and haven't bought the RA2 expansion yet ... don't have the time.

And if/when I do leave, I'm gone.  The people who'll know about it are my
guildies, my RL buddies who play, and anyone else I'm grouping with at that
moment.  Why pester the ng with it?  Seems kinda OT, in a way.
