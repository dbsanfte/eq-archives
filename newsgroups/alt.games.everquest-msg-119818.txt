Hey Lewis, Yea, I use to be quite content with my system, then I
started EQ.  Shortly after I needed better sound, then more memory,
then a router so I could keep playing while connecting my laptop for
work stuff.  The last thing I got was the Luclin expansion, and now I
too am looking at a new graphics card.  Also, starting to have some
reliability issues with my system since making all these changes
(running 2000), so since I may have to do the reinstall thing anyways,
thinking of going back to ME instead of 2000 for better game
resources.   It's never ending, and you hate spending all this time
rebuilding a system when you could be getting one more exp bubble !!
Anyways, when I put on Luclin, I had terrible lag and memory problems,
though I have 512 sys and 32m display adapter. I found that getting
the latest display drivers AND cut down on the texture resolution to
med AND drop the number of detail models to about half of them
resolved my problems.   BTW - I also saw my first horse in WC last
night.  You think if we can get one of those, our lives won't be sad
anymore ??  :-)
