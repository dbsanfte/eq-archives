So if your guild is at the same level as a bunch of other guilds, and
you're trying to decide where to raid on a given weeknight when you
suddenly have a bunch of folks online, what do *you* do?

I wound up making a bank of hot keys, way out on the number eight set of
them. (Two left clicks to get to it.)

Six of them have the following:
/who all "Guild Name" 50 60

.. where "Guild Name" is the name of six other guilds that tend to raid
the planes and other stuff that we target. Some of these are friends of
ours that we often cooperate with, some we dont' get along so well with,
and some we just happen to run into in zones we want, but don't think
much about.

 There's a few others a bit behind us that are starting to nibble at
these targets in alliances, but I dont' check them. There's also several
well ahead of us who occasionally will go to one of our targets for some
specific drop for one of their alts or something, but nothing to be done
about that. The "big three" are generally all raiding in the same places
(VT, SSra, ST, ToVN, etc.) and are not a concern.

Then, just for good measure, I have two more:

/who all shaman 50 54
/who all shaman 55 60

This gives me a chance to scan where everyone is at that time. If I see
a bunch of them in any plane or other target, we don't have to waste
time organizing and heading in that direction. If I see most of one of
them anon, then they are on the move someplace and we have to be
watchful.  

The shaman thing was picked for a few reasons:

Shaman is one class that no higher end raid is likely to not have at
*least* a couple of.

There's less shaman post fifty than warriors. Warriors is usually far
too many to list.

Shamn are far less likely to be /anon than clerics or chanters.

I have no idea why I'm posting this, other than throwing out a possibly
useful suggestion, seeing if others had other suggestions on the same
topic. That or work's pretty slow for a Friday morning and I'm just
itching to get the heck out of here and go raiding. :-)
