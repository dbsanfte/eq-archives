  You need to overcome your fear of dying as soon as possible.  I know,
I started out like you, with the intent to play the game and never die.
Not only is this not really possible, but if you have that as your goal
you will miss most of the game.  Not only are there cool places to go and
cool things to do, but eventually you are going to realize (if you keep
playing) that equipment is going to become extremely important to you.
It's practically impossible to effectively play at higher levels without
at least decent equipment, and if your server is fairly old you'll be
embarrassed pretty frequently if your stats aren't way up there.

  The brutal fact is, the only way to get either good money or good 
equipment is to find friends and go hunt in dangerous places like 
dungeons, where you *will* die fairly frequently and sometimes have a
difficult corpse recovery.

  That said, it's perfectly possible to play safe and solo and have fun,
if that's all you want out of the game.  Just be aware there's alot more
available than that if you choose to pursue it, and it you make the decision
to continue playing at the higher levels you'll be both lonely and threadbare
unless you start early to group often, meet people, and take risks.

  Take it from me, I learned this the hard way.
