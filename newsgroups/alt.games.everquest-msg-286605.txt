Aparantly, there's a dupe bug that allows people to dupe tradeskill created 
bags (AAAA,
leatherfoot, tae ew, etc). SOE will not be rolling people's accounts back. 
The only concern you should have about SOE doinking with your character is 
if you unfortunately bought one of these bags from one of the dupers. If so, 
you might end up with one of those large disenchanted bags in your inventory 
instead of the bag you bought. You may or may not get your plat refunded. If 
you were one of the people doing the duping, then you might want to brace 
yourself for a little bit harsher treatment from SOE. But then again, you 
prolly would have done it from one of those 30 day free trial accounts 
instead of with your level 75 main character account.
