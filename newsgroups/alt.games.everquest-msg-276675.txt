Cripes, guy! Your secondary is faster than my primary (1.2 GHz P3
Tualatin, 512MB RAM, NVidea 5600)!  I run full luclin models + the new
water/lighting effects just fine at 1600x1200 and the NVidiea red-blue
3D display extention, so you shouldn't have any problems running both
systems with full Luclin models, new water & lighting, AND shadows.

Anyhow, the dual-screen trick is an old one, despite the claims of
stardock.com, well known in the VNC world.  Google x2vnc and win2vnc to
learn more about this.

I have a similar setup for myself; I have the afore-mentione Pentium
III system running along side a 300MHz UltraSPARC IIi running Solaris
9.  Both are configured to control the screen of the other from
either's keyboard/mouse, which is useful for looking things up while
in-game.  The problem is that EverQuest grabs a firm hold on the mouse,
and won't let go unless explicitely told to do so (ctrl-shift-R or
something); this means that if the WindowsXP system running EverQuest
is in control, I cannot move the mouse over to the Solaris system to
look things up on the web.  I have to use the SUN keyboard/mouse if I
want to do this.  If you've never used a SUN keyboard and mouse, I
highly recommend going to your local computer surplus store and
inquiring.  However, they are not very good for playing EverQuest, plus
the UltraSPARC is not quite powerful enough to deal with the
resolutions I run EverQuest at (1600x1200), resulting in choppy mouse
movement.  So, the setup is rarely used while playing.

Also, if you've never played EverQuest in glorious 3D with red-blue
anaglyph glasses, and you're running on an NVidia card, what's wrong
with you?! ;)

Xiphos - No, seriously.  It literally adds depth to the game! Really
accentuates the polygons on old models, though.
