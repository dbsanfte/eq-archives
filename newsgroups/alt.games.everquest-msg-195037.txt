That's nice. It's now 10:28 AM Eastern. That's what, 3PM GMT?? I could
be wrong though but I think it's like 5 hours ahead of us here on the
east coast. That's a far sight beyond their "Prediction" if I am
right.

In any event, the last time they said 6 hours it ended up being all
day. I'm just asking if this is the norm for Sony and EQ or not. 

Thanks for the reference though.
