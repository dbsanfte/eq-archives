   Good question.  Several long time players around here thought that it
might be plausible that they were.  And sadly, I think that the answer is
yes, they would dare, if they decided that it would in the end get them
more money than it would cost them.  And if EQ does go into a downward
spiral like some think it might, then at some point this might be the best
new "Let's wring the last drop of milk out of this dying cow" scheme.
