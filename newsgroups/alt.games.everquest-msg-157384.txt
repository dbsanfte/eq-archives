I must have missed it.  I was camping the AC.  Heh.  j/k.  Actually, what
got me about Ben Stein was the fact that the ToS clearly states you have to
have your parents permission if you are under 18.  I'm sure we all agree
that's weak because how many people actually read that and, those that do,
actually abide by that particular rule.  I agree with the fact that if Ben
was so worried about it, why did he keep paying for it.  I also agree that
if Ben was showing proper parenting skills he wouldn't have sent his kid
off.  He would have dealt with the problem himself.  Parents should take an
interest in the computer games kids play just like they should monitor what
movies/tv shows they watch.  I'm sure it's easy to say "Great, the kid is
playing his computer game instead of out getting high or robbing gas
stations".  It's all about accountability.  The lack of which is making the
lawyers in this country extremely over worked.
