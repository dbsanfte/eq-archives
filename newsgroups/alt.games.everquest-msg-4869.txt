The first:

From the post titled "GetsumJ and Avenger"

You asked for it, you got it.

The FANG has become boring and predictable.  I know the contents of each
post before opening them.  I've started to feel psychic, so I came here.

For those of you who don't know me, allow me to introduce myself.  I am
Sword, FA Newsgroup Chairman and CEO.  In a word, I am the current ruler and
lord of the Fighter Ace newsgroup.  I will not attack the people here in
this newsgroup, unless I am attacked first.  It's easy.  Play nice with me,
and I'll play nice with you.  Just a little FYI.  AVG_Girvin_SFAC really is
a homosexual, so go easy on him.  :-D

<begin note taking>

Now, someone please explain to me how this community works.  Is Everquest
worth spending the money on the software, and paying a monthly fee just to
play it?  I'm considering it now, but won't bother if it's not worth it.
I've gone that route before (FA).

Fighter Ace Newsgroup Chairman and CEO





The second:

From the post titled "Thanks EQ"

Thanks to all the people who provided URL's and information.  I will be
purchasing my Everquest software today.

Also, thanks to the people who posted useful information to this forum over
the last few days.  Your help is appreciated.

See you all in the game.

Sword



The third:

From the post titled "Tact or brute force?"

In other words, warrior type characters vs. characters who utilize a thought
process (magicians, druids).  My question is, with which character would a
person be more likely to gain and maintain levels?  I'm taking into
consideration that warrior classes are limited to certain attributes, as are
magicians/clerics/druids.  I'm polling this group for opinions on this
matter, since this will be the character I choose and stick with.

Thanks in advance,

Sword

Shall I continue?
