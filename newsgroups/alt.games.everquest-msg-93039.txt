That hasn't been my experience, at all...  When I first started over a year
ago, I was very lost...  Just started a half-elven Druid out in Qeynos, and
had no clue what I was doing...  Some guy came up and just handed me a
Velium Scimitar (Heh... at level 39, I -still- have it in my bank..  More
sentimental value than anything  =) )  But yeah...  When I started out,
anyway, there were many very helpful people around...
