Well, I'd expect that an EQ2 server can support more people than an EQ1
server from a server resources point of view because of better hardware,
and because of instancing, putting more people on a server is OK from a
gameplay point of view, so 12 doesn't seem that unreasonable.

For comparison to other games, EQ1 has about 50 servers for 500k subscribers
(so, 10k subscribers per server), DAoC has 19 servers for 250k subscribers
(13k subscribers per server), and CoH has 11 servers for around 200k
subscribers (18k subscribers per server).

So, for a low estimate, let's assume EQ2 can handle the same load as CoH.
That would make 12 enough servers to handle 216k subscribers.  That should
be plenty initially.

If the EQ2 servers can handle 30k subscribers per server (which doesn't seem
unreasonable to me), 12 servers would be enough for 360k, which quite
possibly is enough for the lifetime of the game.

I suspect that they can actually handle a lot more per server.  In fact, for
a game with instanced zones, if they designed the architecture reasonably,
it would not surprise me if they *could* do the whole thing on one server if
they wanted.  The number of servers they selected might well have more to do
with things like making it easier for players to get names they like than
keeping server populations from exceeding server capacity.  Imagine how hard
it could be to get a name you like if it has to be unique among all
characters on all accounts!
