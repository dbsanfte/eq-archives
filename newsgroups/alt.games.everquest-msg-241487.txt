That's a sad indictment of the mentality of the abusers in my opinion.

I actually included the whole thread including my first post which was
in response to Lance Berg.  It should have come up in a pane on the
left of Google. Didn't it?  I did not highlight any particular post.

What lie that was my first post and I acknowledge that .. I did by
posting the whole thread.  You will note a bit further down the thread
that Lance and I had a pleasant conversation about the Great Barrier
Reef.

I think we will agree to disagree over the topposting .. I do believe
that a group is a top posting group if the majority of posts in it are
top posted.  Do I agree with the top posting ... no.  Does it bother me
.. no .. if I have been following a thread from the beginning ... I
know what they are referring to.  If I was not following threads it
probably would bother me but I only read threads which interest me.

No one takes them to task for top posting except the guy who I referred
to in my second post.  He is the only one I have seen since I started
using NGs and as you have seen he did not get assailed by abusive
language ... this is the only group that I visit that does this.

Disagree with that it proved that the majority of posts within the NGs
I mentioned were top posted.  That, in fact was how I headed the
relevant reply.  (Top posted and bottom posted)

You want me to go to Google again to dig out some Bizbee beauties?

Three of them are and the one that most people fixated on was the
alt.comp.periphs.mainboard.abit

As I have said not a word of abuse in any of them in the threads I look
at.

Never miss an opportunity to make others happy, even if you have to
leave them alone in order to do it. ~Author Unknown
