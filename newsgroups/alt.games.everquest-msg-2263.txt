I guess I should try playing whatever class it is you are playing.  My
problem is not enough downtime.  I tend to get behind on housework,
eating, sleeping etc because everytime I try to get up the warrior is
bringing back another pull.  Even solo my dang chars have a bad habit of
managing mana so well that just when one battle ends and I think I could
go see whats for dinner I realize that I am almost at full mana and
might as well grab one more.  So tell me, solo warrior?  Is that the
answer?  Solo wizard?  How can I get me some of this downtime?
