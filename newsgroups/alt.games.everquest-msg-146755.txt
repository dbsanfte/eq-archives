Tanks have it simple: Get aggro, keep aggro, die as needed.

1HS are faster and  tend to get the attention of mobs better than 2HS. Smart
rangers (when not MT) will have a slower 2HS wep available to let the MT get
and keep aggo. There aint nothing more pesky than a dual lammy wielding
ranger who keeps taken the aggro!

Not to underestimate the power of 2HS, I have trained it (as well as all my
weps skills) to max for my level, just to keep myself well-rounded for
weapon skills.

You also must realize in higher groups we are not as much the damage
dealers, but the damage takers. This took me a long time to come to grips
with, it flys in the face of what I thought an RPG warrior was! Ah EQ...
