	It's a complicated question that relies on a bit of foresight, I'm
afraid. Are you going to want to play on a lot of events? Are you more
interested in solo?

	I'll assume you don't want to solo, otherwise you'd go with any of
the other classes much better suited (necro, mage, druid, etc).

	A natural extent of grouping is events, so I'll assume that as you
level you'll be more and more interested in that ('specially since that's
where all the /really/ good stuff is).

	So I'd say, without hesitation, that you should make a warrior.

	Monks, pre-Kunark, owned all up and down the block. We had better
AC than pretty much everyone without even trying, HPs were fairly close,
we outdamaged warriors by a fair margin, taunted off everyone, and had a
bunch of neat tricks besides.

	Kunark came out, and warriors became uber. Monks still did more
damage than them, but not a whole lot, and rogues had filled the "raw
damage" niche much better, anyway. Can't pull anymore, either. It still
works, but it's a complete PITA and very risky.

	Velious came out, and with top-of-the-line weapons monks do no
more damage than a warrior (warriors probably do more when you factor in
crits, triple attack, and kick), and rogues also outdamage us from the
/front/ (thanks, Double Backstab). Both classes have more AC and HP than
a monk, and it's a rare occasion indeed in Velious when FD pulling works
properly.

	Which means that monks are /almost/ worthless at the top level
game in Velious. There's a couple pulls that you might want a monk for, but
you could do just as well with an SK, if not better. The only reason to have
a monk is for when the shit hits the fan and you have to CR people out of
some nasty spots. Bringing more than two monks on an event is a waste.

	Didn't mean to turn this into a bitch session, but hey, these
things happen. =)
