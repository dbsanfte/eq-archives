Or, it very well could.  The EQ fanbase has turned down flashier games
before.

Your argument is still out of place in this discussion.  I've never said
that Verant owes anybody anything, just as I never said they owe me
anything.  If you're going to refute my points, please at least stick to the
ones I actually make.

You assume EQ is only going to break even.  I say they'll still make a
heafty profit.  You don't just cast aside a hefty profit just because
there's a larger on nearby.  You grab both, and make your sharholders happy.

The EQ2 base isn't doing crap.  It has no base, the game isn't out.  How
many do you think will try EQ2 and decide "this is crap"?  One thing that's
always certain in RPG's (not sure about MUDs, since I never played them) is
that the sequal pales in comparison to the orginal, even though it's newer
and flashier.

or (as you seem to ignore)

3)  EQ remains just as profitable as it always has been, and continues to
run happily, with it's own support and development staff.
