My mind has the ability to transport me to alternate universes much more
powerfully than mere mmrpgs. Generally what happens in the Universes In My
head is infinately darker and more worrying psychologically than anything
that is served up in some candy ass G rated game as well.  BTW - cars,
nutcase religos, drugs, resource squandering, violence and real life warfare
are rather more damaging to society in my books. A few thousand people not
shaving daily and risking their chance at contributing to worldwide
overpopulation is hardly of concern.

What about the Defence industries? Petroleum industry? Tobacco, alchohol,
illegal narcotics, mining, logging, slash burn farmers... get the picture
yet? Now how the heck did you get a bug up your ass about the gaming
industry? Hubby neglect your fat ass? Loser son suck up a shotgun? Whatever
is was get over it already will ya.

And this is bad somehow? So pro golfers, wrestlers, soccer players, surfers,
baseballers are somehow all worthy of near diety status yet when
some computer weilding dork makes a few bucks it is somehow all wrong?
Personally I would like to see scientists, eviromentalists, sustainably
sound primary producers and health care proffesionals having resources, fame
and fortune showered upon them but who the heck am I to judge a persons
worth eh?

Thai Authorities also declared open season on drug dealers and users and the
blacklisted peeps were turning up dead by the thousands with no due process
whatsoever. They also have a prime Minister who was previously the countries
richest man (Telecommunications baron) who in three years since elected has
turned back decades worth of Democratic reforms and introduced a virtual
police state by use of fear and incited xenophioa. Yah- I am sure they are
the only ones with their heads out of their asses...

Opinions are like assholes, everyones got one and the only thing in common
is that they all stink.

You can list a hundred different scenarios and the only thing in common is
fucked up people. People suck, regardless of their activities and pastimes.
It is oen of the few true constants.

Perhaps idiots should come with warning labels instead, it would be a lot
cheaper to label them than every single potentially dangerous item/activity.

Is there a research and support group for people lobbying absolutely
pathetic issues? Seriously - stop and take a look at the world you live in,
how the crapola did you come to the conclusion that the evils of online
gaming was a pressing issue worthy of drastic action?
