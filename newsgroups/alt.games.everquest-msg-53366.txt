Okay, granted, I'm not a very high level myself, only a level 16 warrior,
but recently I've been overrun by rude lvl 1's begging me for stuff....

When I started, I kind of figured half the fun was earning stuff for
yourself, so I did, and do.  It means a lot of skill development and extra
time, but I feel like I've honestly earned my equipment.

The other day, though, I was in the bank when someone out of the blue asked
me for stuff.  I checked him, it was a level 1 warrior, so I made him some
tattered.  My tailoring skill isn't super high yet, so I had several
failures.  Probably went through about a dozen ruined skins, but that's why
I carry them.

He puts them on, and then 2 minutes later, they're gone.  I figured oh well,
he sold them, no big deal.  I just hoped he got something he wanted.  Then,
i auction off some banded armor, and he pulls out 6pp for a piece of armor.
I sold it to him, but lectured him, too.

Argh.  That's happened to me several times lately.  Went to the tailor ship
and a lvl 3 warrior wearing banded armor (which is what I'm just now earning
my way out of at lvl 16) begging me for stuff and harassing me when I said I
wasn't going to give him anything.

Oh well, I know venting here won't help anything, but it feels good to vent.
:)

Laters,

mike
