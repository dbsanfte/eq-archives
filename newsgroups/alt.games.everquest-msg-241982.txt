It's an open server asshole.

You don't know who Jose Padilla is. Strike two.

Jose Padilla was born in Brooklyn and raised in Chicago. He has been held as
an "enemy combatant" by the Federal government for a year and a half. The
courts have ordered his release but the Bush administration has refused.

If the Supreme Court agrees with the Bush administration (they have two
votes for sure in Scalia and Thomas who have both argued that it's OK to
torture American prisoners in American prisons) then the 4th, 5th and 6th
Amendments are no longer valid, and this country is a dictatorship.

And you assholes don't even know who Jose Padilla is.

While the Constitution burns you play games.
