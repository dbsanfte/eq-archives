The common accepted practice, especially here, is to put the quoted portion
of the message your replying to on top, with your replay below.  Also it's
common to snip the quoted portion down to the relevant part that you
are replying to.  Just like I've done for this reply.

The problem is, a lot of news readers automatically set you up for
"post top/quote bottom" and that's just not kosher around these parts.

The exception is if you're replying to several points in a post, you'll
see the reply interlaced through out the message.

There are several arguments for and against "post top/quote bottom"
and "quote top/post bottom".  I post the way that is accepted here.
I really don't care as long as it's consistent.  Where you get a thread
that uses both methods, it gets a bit hairy to follow the discussion.

Then there's the folks that don't quote at all.

Anyway, HTH.
