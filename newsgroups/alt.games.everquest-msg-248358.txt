Is there any way to change the new style login screen back to the old
one, while still having all the required files to actually get into
the game? the password to an acct a friend was letting me use works
with the old login, but not with the new one for some reason. It has
nothing to do with the caps lock bug, and i dont feel like waiting for
sony to fix it.
