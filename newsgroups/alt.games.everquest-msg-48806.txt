 Yeah I bought in and installed it this morning and have been unable
to create an account.
 
 EB just got them in today, none were returned yet (according to the
2 store people) and yet I cannot create an account because it says my
CD Key is already in use. What the heck? Crap.
 
 Been calling DAOC long distance phone support number all day, it's 
continuously busy of course, the web site does not load and the email
I sent is returned undeliverable. Also, just a few minutes ago I tried
to get to the account creation screen one more time and I now get the 
message that the servers will be down for another hour and a half.
 
 Come on, I know this is the first or second day and there's bound to
be a glitch or two but give me a break! Without a possibility of this
CD key having been purchased, installed and used already (I got the 
last copy in the store) how can my CD key "already be in use"?
 
 Anyone else have this problem?
 
 Of course, all 3 EBs in my area are now sold out and will not get more
copies in for 3 or 4 days they say. Great.
