Where else can you get so much aggravation for a measly 10 a month?  Just
keep repeating to yourself, "It's only a game".  One thing you might try, is
twink a new enchanter with boatloads of cash, good int and cha gear, and
work his jewelcraft up to 250.  Use him/her for jewelcraft, use your level
55 one for enchanting materials.  Beyond that, I don't have a good
suggestion for you.
