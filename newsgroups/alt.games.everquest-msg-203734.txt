For Bard, Cleric, Enchanter, Paladin, Ranger, and Druid (in no particular
order) add Pacify/Harmony ability, making it easy to pull singles or avoid
adds.  Ranger and Druid version is outdoor only.

Add Invis to Undead to Cleric, Paladin, and Enchanter.  Cleric has group
version at higher levels.

Wizard snare is not single-target, it's AOE only.

Add Track to Bard list.  It's limited range, but it's there.

Add Mana Drain to Bard, Enchanter, and Paladin.

You should add 'Tank' to your list.  Melee damage output doesn't equal melee
take-damage.  Warriors, Paladins, and Shadowknights should have Tank added,
and to a lesser extent Ranger.  Bards should NOT have tankage added, sadly.
