Well, I did somehow manage to struggle up to level 65 without any armor I 
could legitimitely earn.  I did not seriously bother with the bazaar for 
equipment for my main pretty much ever.  I have bought a grand total of 4 
or 5 pieces of equipment from the bazaar for my main all after level 65, 
the rest I earned through questing and xping, and raiding.
