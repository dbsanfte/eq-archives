You should definatly make the transition to bronze. Some pieces of course that
have been mentioned here should help give you a STR boost. The best out of
these I believe are Jagged Bands, people use these forever. To many people act
like you have to buy ALL your crafted at once. Just make the slow transition.
Start with the smaller pieces-- bracers/gauntlets/etc and just work from there.
You should have a full set eventually, and there is nothing wrong with matching
pee bronze color of bronze with light blueish color of crafted. Its the AC that
matters. Let the casters worry about looking purty =P.
