No, he's in a guild that is anti-loyalty.  Perhaps you need to invest in a
dictionary and examine the difference in those words.

Really...  so where's the tic-tac-toe room?  How about cards?  Pac Man?

Swords?  Spears?  Staves?  What?!?  This game is about fighting?!?  OH MY
GOD!  "EQ is a game, not a war"!!!

Wake up and smell reality.

Those people in real life who are in my "guild" (family, job, circle of
friends, whatever) receive help through real trials in real life.

You're a dumbass if you think me not helping random people is somehow
equivalent to not helping guildmates.  Equivalent to not helping random
people in the game, sure.  Claiming that has *anything* to do with loyalty
or a lack thereof is just fucking stupid.  I don't give my pop change to
panhandlers, and I don't give my spare plat to beggars.  None of which
impugns my loyalty.

Now, try to keep ahold of that oh so tenuous grasp on reality you're
displaying and *try* to come up with something at least semi-logical to
respond with.

Failing that, almost assuredly, at least come up with a reasonable flame. 
You're almost impossible to comprehend when you're off your meds.
