|   Looks like there are some interesting thing upcoming.  The following is cut

|changes about font changes and damage shield messages and whatnot.
|
|cut 'n paste
|
|Targeting - Sometimes it can be difficult to tell which NPC you have targeted.
|With the next update we hope to add a targeting indicator of some sort
|(something like the ring that surrounds your target in EQOA). The exact form
|hasn't been decided, but the goal is to make seeing what you currently have
|targeted much easier. 
|
|Consider - Along the same lines as the proposed improvement to targeting, we
|want to add a way to distinguish the /con color of your target. We plan an
|indicator that will be easily distinguished once you have a target (probably
|someplace in the Target window), that should remove the need to use the /con
|command. 
|

	Someone's been playing SWG again....:-)

|---
|
|/tell windows - It is very easy to lose /tells in the confusion of combat. We
|want to add an option that would work much like an instant messenger. Each time
|you get a "tell" from a new character, a new chat window would open. That window
|will only display "tells" from the particular character, and any message sent
|from the chat window would automatically be sent as a "tell" to that character.
|Obviously this would be an optional feature. 

	Praise Karana...with luck I'll turn it off before I get a single tell.

|    I'm not real sure how I feel about all this.  Yes, it all sounds very
|convenient.  But the game is getting more and more nudged away from the game I
|started playing.  I've said before that I am in favor of losing some of the more
|tedious features of the Vision, but still, there are times when I miss the days
|when things felt harder.

	How hard does it have to be?  Most of the players aren't going to see huge
sections of content no matter how much they bust their humps trying.
