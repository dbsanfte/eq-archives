Cool, that means you're likely on my /ignore list :ï¿½)
AFAIK the trend on BB was started by Jokah (way back in EC Tunnel) and from
all the Casino "operators" I have added to ignore he is so far the only I
would trust (not that I'd ever play) because he is the only one I have ever
seen use his main, with Guild Tag to advertise...All the others have been
done by mules and I can't say I have much faith in some unguilded, Anon,
Mule with no equipment who is green to my 20th level mule.
