Nope.  The XP loss on death is 12.5% (I may not be remembering the
percentage right) of the XP a human cleric would need to complete the
*previous* level, multiplied by your class XP penalty.  (It's multiplied
by the class XP penalty because the way they removed class XP penalties
was by multiplying earned XP by the penalty factor, to cancel out the
penalty, and so death also has to be multiplied).

(NOTE 1: I'm not sure how the above works for warriors and rogues,
becuase they have XP bonuses, and those bonuses were NOT removed when
they removed class XP penalties.  I don't know how that interacts with
death handling)

(NOTE 2: Verant usually says death is a fixed percantage of what a human
warrior needs to complete the previous level.  You can use any
class...you'll just get a different number.  Cleric comes out with a
nicer number than warrior, so I use cleric)

Now let's look at some numbers, for a human cleric.  XP numbers are in
millions:

        LEVEL   XP NEEDED       XP LOSS ON DEATH
           38         5.1        0.60 (2.94 blue bubbles)
           39         5.3        0.64 (3.02 blue bubbles)
           40        12.0        0.66 (1.38 blue bubbles)
           41         6.4        1.50 (5.86 blue bubbles)
           42         6.7        0.80 (2.99 blue bubbles)

Dying in 41 is much worse than dying in 39, 40, or 42.
