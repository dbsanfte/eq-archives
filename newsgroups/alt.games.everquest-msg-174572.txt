Hi all you EQ people. This is just a quick note to let you know that
YALP version 2.3 is available for download at http://www.yalp.org.
YALP is yet another log parser for everquest, its fast, easy, and
produces great damage statistics for every party found in a log file.

If you are looking for a log parser that does the trick for you,
please visit www.yalp.org and see if YALP is the parser for you.
Version 2.3 addresses the concerns of many people who believe that
certain hits were being double counted.

If you have any suggestions or find any problems, please leave a
message on the YALP user forumns at
http://pub78.ezboard.com/byalpmessageboard. I hope that you like YALP,
and get good use out of it.

Happy EQ'ing!
