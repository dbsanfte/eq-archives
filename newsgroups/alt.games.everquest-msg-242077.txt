It happens all the time, it is damned annoying.  It is particularly 
annoying for a MA that is trying to corner a mob, and finds that he keeps 
getting flung several feet out of the corner, thus turning the mob around 
to face all the dps types that were smacking it in the back.  Really 
amusing when the mob is enraged...
