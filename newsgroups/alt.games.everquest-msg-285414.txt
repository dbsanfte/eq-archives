Did you do Crushbone while you could?  Thats a classic zone, with stuff 
to do from 5 to 20 or so, and you can really get the feeling of working 
your way up in power by doing a place like that, starting out barely 
able to handle a pawn, ending up defeating the emperor himself, and that 
DE spy to boot!

One of my favorite zones in the game is Crystal Caverns, a velious zone 
in the middle of the Eastern Wastes.  You'll probably want high 20s 
before venturing there, depending on your gear and the skills of your 
group, but once you can handle it, its a dungeon with its own style to 
it, something people were complaining about elsewhere in the thread.  Te 
first area is a twisting three dimensional maze of tunnels around a 
central pit, full of RyGorr Orcs.  Then there's a small dwarven city 
complete with a bank, and if you kill enough orcs to get your faction 
up, several vendors; I always love a zone where you can hunt, sell, and 
bank.  Deeper in there's some tentacle things down one cave, a long 
passage full of spiders with a queen at the end, and a zigzag tunnel 
leading back up to an exit, full of geonids which for low levels can be 
some of the best cash in the game (but which screw casters out of a 
later quest in WL)
