Mez does nothing to keep the mob from hurting you once the fight has
begun.  Once you swing at it, Mez is broke, and that mob is hitting
you for 100% damage.

Methinks you're confused as to what Slow actually does.  It is not
crowd control.

Let's talk about what happens when you slow a mob by, say... 50%.  The
mob is now swinging at you at half his normal rate.  Meaning the most
damage he can possibly do to your tank is cut by half.  Meaning you
have effectively doubled your tanks hit points.  A cleric in the
situation, fighting a non-slowed mob would have to heal twice as much
as the shaman now does.

Mez won't do this.  You still have to kill the Mez'ed mob at some
point, and he's still going to be at 100% efficiency.  Charm is the
same way, once charm breaks, you still have to kill the mob, and he's
still going to be capable of damaging you for 100% damage.

Look at what Slow does for the group.  You basically castrate the
mob's damage dealing abilities.  You increase a tank's hit points by
several orders of magnitude.  Fights become a trivial matter, you can
take as much time as you want killing the mob, without having to worry
about it actually becoming a danger to the group.  The best exp grind
groups pre-kunark uber mobs (ie:  Anything 100% magic resistant and
level 55+ raid-worthy mobs) are all shaman-centric.  

Of course, it's not like the Cleric is hurt by all this, their
effective monopoly on the Res business makes them not only desirable
for high-level content, but required.  If you have no cleric, you log
on an alt.  Simple as that.
