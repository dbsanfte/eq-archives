The point is that training *anything* to *anybody* who
hasn't given you the "go ahead" signal is bad manners.

The people at the docks are often afk, low mana, low
on HP, watching for the boat, etc.  They're there to
rest up (or are fighting their own mobs), and often 
aren't ready or able to help anyone who runs in with 
lord knows what.

It's always rude to run into the middle of a bunch of
other people with your monsters.  The best thing to do
is either run out the nearest zone line, or if you
have to, run *near* other players (but well out of
monster aggro range), and let off one or two /yells.

Then, if people are ready and willing to help, they
can run over to you and pitch in.  If not...  Then
gracefully die and you'll be far enough away from
them that the monsters ought to wander away without
attacking the people who weren't responsible for your
bad pull in the first place.  They shouldn't have to
be endangered for your mistakes.
