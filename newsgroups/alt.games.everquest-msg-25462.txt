Well I WAS having a problem finding someone to port me. He said he would
port me for 50 plat when level 29 people port for less, free sometimes.

You stop and think, druids don't have to sit there and camp something, they
can be a village taxi. They could make a lot of money just sitting and
porting, where tanks cant do anything like that. We have to go out and camp
something call in friends/guilds. (True druids do camp things and call in
friends/guilds to camp this or that but it isn't there only option to make
money...I am sure it would be boring porting people around all day
though...)

I do know im not a druid or wizards and I DONT know what its like, so I have
no doubt my opinions aren't 100% accurate. If I get you mad, just ignore me
and say its "another mindless tank."
