Depends - you mean while the mage is actively canni-petting (and
therefore doing nothing else) or averaged over a play session.

While actively cp'ing I can manage 150+ mana per tick.  In a session
where I take every opportunity to suspend/canni-pet/unsuspend it 
averages to 20 or 30 mana extra per tick.
