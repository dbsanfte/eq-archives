This is going to sound like a total "newb" question, and, well it is.  But
seeings as I dont play a class that charms [besides druid's animal charm],
I need to know.  Lets say I charm something, and use it as my pet.  It is
gaining experience as it kills.  If I was able to keep it alive and play
long enough.  Could the charm'd mob actually "Ding"?
I can see it now.
An orc pawn shouts "w00t ding level 15!"
