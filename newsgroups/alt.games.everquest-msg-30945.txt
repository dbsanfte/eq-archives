lol! Well see, last time I ran through the WK bandits, I only pulled a 
couple and they were easily beatable.  So I thought the same thing would 
apply here.  And it DID.  I killed those first two no problem.  It was 
when I sat down at what I THOUGHT was a good distance that I got in 
trouble (later I looted a derv corpse next to them and they didn't attack 
- I don't get them).  And then when I DID try distance pulling, two 
casters had popped, and they were crushing me before I could even get 
close to em.  Too bad you can't tell a caster like you *usually* can in 
derv camps :)
