	Have you ever played UO?  Or Diablo II?

	In UO the balance was such that, at least for me, my eyes were 90%
	on the terrain, only 10% on the map, and even then that was only
	when traveling long distance.

	In Diablo II it seemed completely the other way around.  At least as
	a necro with more then a dozen pets around me, I almost never payed
	attention to the game as it was a full time job watching the map and
	my pet icons.

	My point is that in game maps can lean to either direction.  I'd
	prefer they lean to the UO side myself (useful, but not a focus).  I
	do however, like the idea of being able to mark a map up as I go. 
	There are many places in EQ that are a bitch to find unless you know
	the exact loc.  They are explicitly hidden and landmarks often are
	non-existent.  I don't mind finding it once as a game feature, but
	if I'm doing a bank run I prefer not to waste a half hour trying to
	find my way back each time.  So I'd just mark it the first time I
	found it and be very happy.
