Oddly enough, the revenge thing happened for me last night. Made the trip
from Kunark back to Antonica on some muling/merchanting business, and
stopped in to High Keep.  Even though she conned green to me, that bard
bitch on the steps attacked me YET AGAIN!  I well remembered all the times
my troll had to run back to the zone from that annoying little twat.  Well,
I finally decided, "Fuck my Antonican Bards faction!" and I ganked her right
there on the steps. Made me feel good until I say that I had taken yet
ANOTHER hit to my Knights of Truth faction. Well, screw it. I'm just never
going to N. Freeport, obviously.
