    The zone is supposed to be like Lake of Ill Omen. If it has the same
sorts of mob densities and levels, it will be packed no matter WHAT drops
there.

    VI regards LoIO as a triumph. People travel there from far off, and
brave tougher mobs (Drachnids, the run from OT/FM bind point) to do it. Once
there, they ALL find stuff to kill at a rate that makes them happy. And it's
not like anything "of quality" drops on any regular basis there. Also, other
than off-topic bickering, the only complaints I ever hear when running
through Lake are from the Prod campers. If Stonebrunt can capture that same
feeling, then half of South Karana and part of Lake will empty from the
people heading to SM.
