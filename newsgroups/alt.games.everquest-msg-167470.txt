Is it possible for a Level 40 Bard solo in Dalnir?  I am able to solo
in Crystal Caverns for the most part and I am wondering if Dalnir is
similar in difficulty.  When I zoned in the first mob I encountered
was a coerced dwarf.  This dwarf conned light blue so I decided to try
to take it out figuring it was just a warrior type mob.  I had a lot
of trouble with this dwarf because he was able to heal himself like a
cleric despite wielding a piercing weapon and hitting me for 60 points
of damage.  When I fled for the zone I could have sworn this
rouge/cleric combo class attempted to backstab me. My 4 song twist of
Hymn, CoD, and my two chants usually take out most mobs below 35
fairly easily with the exception of giants.  Are these type of mobs
consistent throughout the whole zone or is it the coerced dwarfs that
seem overpowered.   I can take out the Shaman in CC fairly quickly and
I hardly lose a bubble of health, and those Shaman con dark blue to
me.

For the bards in the newsgroup, what are your solo strategies for
fighting casters in dungeons?  What songs do you use?  In the past
I've done chain-mezzing to interrupt their casting while twisting a
haste & damage shield buff.  Does anyone have a better approach?  I
decided to hunt here because I'm trying to get my 4th coin for the
Nostrolo's Tambourine quest.
