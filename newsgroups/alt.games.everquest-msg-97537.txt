All depends how you fight. Most druids at 19 are doing more casting and much
less head to head fighting. Thus wis becomes more important than ac. But, if
your wis is doing fine, ac never hurts for when a mob gets a swipe at you or
you draw aggro while group casting.

At 19 I can't imagine an untwinked druid having to many wis items. So, my
advice would be the Aviak Charm.

BTW check this out: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=646

Its a nice little quest that a young porter can do for an even better wis
item.

G'luck
