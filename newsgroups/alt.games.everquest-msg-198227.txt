(waves hand) Add another to the list of "Win98 with more than 512MB". No
tweaking required. Started with 256MB, upgraded to 640MB. (Add 2 256MB
DIMMs, remove one 128MB DIMM).

Actually it's Win98SE. Perhaps that's where the difference lies? Could
they have fixed it in Win98SE? Or maybe it's BIOS related... my system is
otherwise pretty poor by modern standards.
