I use Btopenworld ADSL connection

Last time I checked you had to be within 2 (or was it 3) miles of enabled
telephone exchange

They have a new self setup system now, so you dont need to wait 3 weeks for
the engineer to turn up (when all he does is drink tea and look on his
laptop to see if it shows a smiley or grumpy face ... I kid you not)

I've had it about 5 months now, and its great ... No LD, and it is fun being
the LPB on my guilds counterstike server (Whoohoo Pride Of VahShir)
