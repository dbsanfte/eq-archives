Yes I do. And believe me it is appreciated. Do not take it the wrong 
way. I'm not attacking any of the countries I mentioned. In all honesty 
I would prefer the United States acted more as they do, more neutral and 
not "leading the pack" as much.

This is also true. What I meant by doing their part was to help more to 
prevent these things from occurring. Many nations have been the targets 
of terrorism in the past thirty years. Britain with the IRA, Japan with 
the JRA, Italy with the Red Brigade, Germany with the Red Army Faction, 
Spain with the Basques.. the list can go on and on. Why now? Why after 
possibly 5000 deaths are we getting together as one and doing something 
about it? As I said before I blame no country, but this has been going 
on for over thirty years now and only because of a large death toll is 
it being acted upon.

Unfortuneatly that has turned out to be untrue.
