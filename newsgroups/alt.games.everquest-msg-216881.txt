I've been playing my 63 (now 64) rogue both in pickup groups (shudder)
and guild groups and from what I've seen there's no difference in mob
difficulty between a low aa 65 dungeon with some sub 65 members mixed
in and a dungeon generated for people with 200'ish aa on average, which
most of my guild groups would have. Every L65 mission I've been on the
mobs hit for about 325, and aren't noticably harder to hit depending on
the strength of the group. I don't think they're doing any balancing at
all based on anything but the levels in the group.
