The most common source of "compromised" accounts is probably
"borrowed" accounts.  People give out their account info for all kinds
of reasons to "friends".  When the relationship (in-game or out-game)
sours, somebody gets revenge by stripping an account, or binding the
former friend's character next to some giants then  going out for a
night on the town while logged in.

I know a couple people this has happened to, and have heard
"friend-of-a-friend" stories a few more times.  Its fairly common, and
Verant is probably in the right to just ban such accounts when
compromised.
