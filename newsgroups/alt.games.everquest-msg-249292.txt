I'm going now to the AS to try this out. I went to my tribute master (clumsy
to get to, even for a druid, hate to think about a non-porter trying to get
there) and tried lots of things that people had suggested before. Wow,
nothing. About the only decent one was 10 points for an acrylia reinforced
mask. As they are a skillup item, they are difficult to sell and only get
less than a plat from a merchant.

I definitely see why people were so mad at GoD. Apart from AS, there's not a
lot there for a 57 druid in non-raiding gear.. i tried the port spell and
got half deaded by some crab critter on zone in; had to run and gate out
past the npc's who ignored the crab, alas.

The creature was DB and i've meleed mobs in quite a few planes who were DB
and who still couldn't chew through my hits anywhere near that fast.

I hope AS will be so good that I'll feel better about the money i spent on
this expansion.
