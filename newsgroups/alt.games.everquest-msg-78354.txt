  Maybe doing his epic quest. ;)  And the shadow knight mob wouldn't
necessarily have to be wielding the thing, he could just be carrying
it around as a trophy that he received off one of the paladins he's
killed. :P

  In seriousness, I'm a bit concerned about the Ghoulbane because I'm
a shadow knight who (eventually) wants to complete his epic quest.
Problem is, I play on Firiona Vie, and in several levels, the froglok
shin lord will be green to me and TLC will be kicking in.  :\  I guess
that's just one of the downsides of playing on FV.  I really don't
want to convince my guild that we should be camping the froglok shin
lord so I can do my epic a year from now, especially since we're kind
of SK-heavy and if we do it for one member of the guild, we should do
it for all.  And I think more than two Ghoulbane camps would drive me
insane.

  I guess I'd just like to see as many ways to obtain a Ghoulbane as
possible.
