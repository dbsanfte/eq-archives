Generally, the main tank, who is in front of the mob, wants a 2 hander in 
order to reduce the riposte damage he takes, and increase the riposte 
damage he deals.  If you are not fighting from the front, then, sure, 
dual wield fast good delay weapons.  Of course, who wants an additional 
warrior who is not the main tank over a DPS person?
