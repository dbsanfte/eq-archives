I want to say one thing. My wife left the house at 8 am, yeah! I sat down to
plug in to karana and the update was still going on. I have been waiting all
morning and my wife just got home at 1:15pm. I have been cheated of play
time. I cant believe that it has taken so long. I dont know when a chance
like this will come again, but it better not be on a update day.
