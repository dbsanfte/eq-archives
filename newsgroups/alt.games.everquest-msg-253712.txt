After much consideration, I am creating a new bard.

I am so bored with my druid and my warrior, and I find the enchanter kind of
weird to play.

I have a few bucks to get him started, but really don't want to overtwink
him. Want to play him fairly straight, maybe having him inherit around 1,500
pp to start out.

Making him a Vah Shir. I like the way the look, although the city is a
frickin maze. He's now level 3 and I haven't even stopped by a store yet,
much less the bazaar.

Give me some starting advice. What to buy for armor, weapon. How to set up
spell icons, etc. TIA
