Yes, there is an additional montly fee of $9.89, and, of course, your own 
internet access fees. Having said that, EQ has saved me money, because I 
used to spend a lot more than that in games every month.

As for the difficulty of getting into it, don't worry too much. At the 
early levels, your choices are very limited, and the game is nicely paced 
for you to acquire knowledge as you gain levels and (in the case of magic 
users) spells. You won't have to worry about raid protocols and 
"ghetto-mezzing" when you are whacking rats in the newbie garden, believe 
me. =)

Of course, this newsgroup and other online resources are invaluable for 
when you are ready to actually know what you are doing, and exploit the 
strenghts of your chosen class to the full.
