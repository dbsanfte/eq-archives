 Wizards should also be using the Concussion spell after nukes. 
Concussion lowers the caster further down the hate list if it 
lands. If it doesn't land the Wizard should cast it again, even
if it doesn't stick the second time the time spent casting will
have delayed him enough for the MT to have progressed further
up the hare list enough to avoid agro from the next nuke.
