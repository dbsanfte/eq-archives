: Hitting F9 will switch to various "camera" angles - which you can pan
around with.

There are diferent camera angles and effectes.
Normal (ie first person)

Hit F9 once and get - Top Down View ( use this when moving about in the
bazaar, it causes the least amount of lag.)

 *  THe next time you hit it you get a camera that is teathered behind
you(When you turn it moves the oposite way to stay a set distance behind
you, but still focused in the direction you are going.)  When you turn it
will always turn with you.

*  The third time you hit it you get a camera angel that you can chane the
point of view, but it turns with you.   (ie you set it to the right of you
so you can see  your character and everything to the left of you.  If you
turn the camera turns with oyu to keep that point of view.

* forth time you get about the same thing as before, except the camera
doesn't turn with you. The camera keeps looking in the same direction ( N,
E, S, W, any combination of them) no mater what direction you turn.  This is
used a lot to chack out your own character. ( get neer a wall and go into
this view. move the camera around so that you see mostly your toon and then
you can use the arrow keeys to turn your toon.)

Hit F9 again and you are back to first person.  I think that is the rotation
of cammle effects.

* now for what the * ment.  On the camera angle that  have a * you can pan
left and righ, Change the hight, and pitch the cameera up and down by using
the Eather the control key or the alt key and the number pad keys.  Pitch is
the 9 and 3 key.  Hight is adjusted with the 7 and 1 key's and rotatin is
done with the 4 and 6 key.  just like first person you can reset this just
by hitting the 5 key.

PS if you do this and you loos your UI  you just ahve to hit F10 to bring it
back.

There is a list of those comands in game under the Optoins (alt O) Keyboard
tab.

Hope this helped.
