And what I'm saying is there is no less point to it than ANY
roleplaying. If people can roleplay in an IRC chatroom, then they
should have a _far_ easier time roleplaying in EQ.

You mentioned the struggle agaisnt Blackburrow. Recall that the game
has only really been up for 2.5 years. Many people IC ignore the "game
time" years, because they're silly. Why is it unreasonable that it
would take more than a couple years to root out a gnoll stronghold?
You sound like you expect the world to be totally revamped every few
months. That's just unreasonable. There are changes every day, but
those changes come in the form of PC changes, not NPC...
