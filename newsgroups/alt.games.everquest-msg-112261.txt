Oh yeah, fucktard 60 monk (to make them green-light blue) kills faster and
better then you huh?

HOW DARE HE!!!!  ITS AN OUTRAGE!!!  FIX DRUIDS ASAP!!!!  They must be able
to outkill 60 monks, right?

The few occasions that I stop and fight Wyverns when passing through
CS/waiting on a port, im usually down a bub or so at the end of the fight (I
don't wear my fungi my default).. but the exp is so slow and the place is so
camped, I rarely bother.

If im fighting a drake on the other hand (even a green one)  I take some
serious damage from his damn ae
