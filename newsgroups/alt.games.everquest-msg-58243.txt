On that note, I say, "Peace, Brother."  But as to being "close-minded" I
would beg you to consider that there is nothing I despise more than
close-mindedness. So, do take my word for it when I say that in order *not*
to be close-minded I have opened my mind to the verses of the Qur'an; I have
read the Bible cover to cover three times.  You can take my word for it or
not, and if not you'll need only to find out for yourself, this fact:  when
it comes to the frequency of violent polemic in the Koran against the
enemies of Islam, as compared to the same thing as coming from the Hebrew
prophets and scribes against their enemies, as to the amount of text you can
read on any given page without running into some hateful screed?  It's got
to be at least ten to one.  You can hardly find a page of the Koran that
does not contain some hateful harrangue against the perceived Unbeliever or
Infidel.

It makes for some *very* unpleasant reading, especially seeing how little
there is in terms of any blessing of spiritual insight.  Torah is full of
teaching given by example from the lives of the great seers, sinners and
heros of Hebrew history; each story, that of Abraham, of Jacob, of Joseph,
of Samson, of David, of Deborah and Esther is full and overflowing with
things that teach the human soul about how to get along with other people in
this world, how to stand up against oppression, how to stand for justice,
how to find courage against huge odds.

Those same stories are re-told in the Koran to different purposes and to
make different points, to support a lust for vindictiveness and lack of
mercy when the original story teaches the opposite.

To be fair, mercy *is* taught in the Koran, here and there, but so long as
that teaching is drowned out by the opposite demand for merciless
destruction of enemies, then the conclusions that can be drawn from the
Koran are not those that come from Torah about the moral superiority of
mercy, as David and the prophets, Solomon are there to write thier
lamentations over the times when people like Joshua and that stinker Ezra
(later on) did not temper justice with mercy and lack of prejudice.  With
Torah, as it's read in view of the Prophets, there can be no confusion about
it; there is no six of one, half dozen of the other, and as Jesus came to
fulfill the whole kit and kaboodle of it, there is no further doubt in the
matter, about the rightness of mercy as opposed to the opposite.  This
cannot be derived from the Koran where there is no supercession; it is only
their one prophet speaking out both sides of his mouth.

That's the whole problem.  That's why Islam is the most violent religion on
earth, why it always has been and always will be a huge source of terror and
disaffection on the earth. It is not a revealed religion it is a mere heresy
loosely based on the texts of the revealed religions of Moses, Isaiah and
Christ.

The longer we leave the Islamists in the suffering of their error, the
longer it goes on, and all the closer we draw our chariots to the bloody
awful field of skulls and dry bones at Armageddon.  There comes a time to
speak the truth, one to the other, in compassion with no concern for mere
miserable comfortable little attachments to the familiar and the
traditional.  It is time for Spiritual Man to be weaned from the poison pap
that we otherwise suck from the Mother of All Whores of Error.

Time to tell it like it is.
