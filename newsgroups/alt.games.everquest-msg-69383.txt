Friday night after a patch when you know the servers are very full and you
lock the servers. I notice more than half the servers are up but Sol Ro is
still down. Me and about 45 other people were in PoH went server went down
without warning. My raid group was in the Throne Room and I think the other
group was on the second floor. Either way not a good thing. Also pretty sure
there were raids on naggy and vox planned for tonight. Thank you so much
Verant for making my EQ life more complicated. I play games to relax - guess
I picked the wrong game, lol.
