We are not God-Like... we necro's die very easilly when things dont go
right.  Sure, we can FD, type /q, log back in, and be almost
completely safe, but there is always that chance that we might not
make it back online again... so its dangerous for us.
Where was I going with this... umm... no we are not gods, just better
all-around suited for Norath and dont specialize in any area... except
for maybe as a melee class... our pets can out-damage/out-tank any
monk/warrior out there, but we sometimes have problems telling them to
stop tearing up mobs and to follow us, so there is our downside.
