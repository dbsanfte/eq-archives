GoD sucked liquid monkey ass but I loved LDoN and LoY.
For a casual player I loved these expansions.

I am in a small guild and we are just now starting to do some tier 1
stuff. Finally broke 4k hp unbuffed with my monk from LDoN gear
and augs. Plus I am wearing 3 items dropped from the Innoruk that
spawns in Crypt of Nadox.
