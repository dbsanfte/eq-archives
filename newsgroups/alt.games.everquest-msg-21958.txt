That is no more a bug than jumping off a cliff to escape a monster.  It is
just using the terrain to your advantage and not exploiting a pathing error.
The fact that orcs don't jump and you can is something natural that you can
use to your advantage.  On the other hand if your jump fails and you fall in
the river the orc will go in after you and you will have a difficult corpse
retrieval, so in the end everything equals out, you took a risk and made it
but you could as easily failed.  As for the chances of the orc swimming the
river and climbing the bank that is not likely to happens there as it
requires ladders to get out in most places.
