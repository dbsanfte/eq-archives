Well my Iksar Necromancer, who has I'm guessing the worst faction of anyone,
can travel safely through both Shadow Haven and the cat city of Shar Vahl.
It takes a little (actually very little) faction work to be able to shop and
bank in Shadow Haven. And of course anyone at all can bank and shop in the
Bazaar. There are even trainers nearby in Echo Caverns (I think that's the
zone).
