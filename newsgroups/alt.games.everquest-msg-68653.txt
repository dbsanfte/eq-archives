Not sure what the difference is between 8.0 and 8.1. You could check
Microsoft for that.

You are also correct in asserting that they have chosen  not to shell out
more money to play a game that was working well enough before a FORCED
upgrade. Nevertheless it is still a choice.

I am sympathetic to those who can no longer play EQ (although I believe
Win95a and OSR2 users are the only people in this category), and can not
afford the $20 necessary to get Win98SE. The problem here, is that the EQ
game is not "owned" by these individuals in the same sense they "own"
Baldur's Gate, Adventure, Quake, etc. The "game" is a conglomeration  of
thousands of interacting users who for the most part would rather see the
game survive into the future. Verant has made the decision that survival is
dependant on moving forward.
