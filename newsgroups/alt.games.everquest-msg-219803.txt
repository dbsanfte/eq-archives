Well again it all depends on weapon setup.  My current DW setup is a
13/17 MH and a 14/18 or 19 off.  So without having TM I could eat a *HUGE*
amount of dmg due to riposte.  In fact, I've gone back to using 2h 90%+ of the
time in ldon hard runs we've been doing to avoid not sustained DPS from mobs
but to avoid the *burst* dps, which always seems to happen when I'm down to
1 bub of health.  Eating 4 ripostes + 2 hits at that point can be, from
a ldon even con ~5k hp.  It's more often that a burst kills ya than anything.
