I find this terribly amusing, since you replied to Julie:
Julie: "Check the newsgroups line. I'm reading these threads because Bob
Perez tends to be pretty informative. I responded to Annie because Annie
chose to encourage a troll and a stalker."

You: "Dear god nooooooooooo... lol."

So you use different aliases in different groups in order to avoid
stalkers, yet you find it a "Dear god nooooooooooo... lol" offense for
Julie to ask someone not to encourage a STALKER.

That's a pretty strange outlook.
Or are you saying that stalking is ok, as long as it's not _you_ being
stalked?
