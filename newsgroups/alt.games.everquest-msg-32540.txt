Actually you have to allow the machine connected to the internet to
be accessed in someway or it can't be. If you allow no traffic except
what you instigate and no serving except only on programs such as you
approve (even a simple firewall like zonealarm does that well enough)
you can't be accessed. It is only when you set up your computer so
that you can connect remotely that it opens up many possible security
problems. Having nothing networked and nothin but tcp/ip on also
helps. Any sharing at all is bad.
