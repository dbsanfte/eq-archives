It's also a good way to keep item scammers from server hopping.
Imagine if they could ninja and scam themselves a fortune and then pay
50 bucks to take their wealth to a server where they wouldn't have a
sullied reputation?

As it is now, people wanting to join friends can ask their friends to
help out with gear for an initial period, people who want to escape a
reputation or just server hop to get away from a crowd are SOL.

(I hope I don't have to explain why a bunch of people changing servers
to find a less crowded one would be futile as well as messy)
