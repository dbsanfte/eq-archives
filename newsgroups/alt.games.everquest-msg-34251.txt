I'm looking for some feedback, from people that have left the game and after
"X" amount of time have come back to start new Char's and begin all over.

Was it worth it? (to come back?)
Did you still enjoy it?

Tell me your thoughts. I've been gone for 4 months. I deleted my char's and
just left. I'm missing it like crazy...I am torn between waiting for DAOC to
come online, or just reinstall EQ and start again.
