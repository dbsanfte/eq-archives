If Dual Weild isn't going off more than once or twice per combat,
then the higher ratio isn't going to mean much and the proc is
likely going off only once an hour... 700pp is a lot more to spend
than the 5pp or so you'd pay for a GHL.  If 700pp is chump change
for you, then you should still be looking for something faster
rather than something more serious.  20 delay is 10% faster
than 22, which means 10% more skill checks per hour.
