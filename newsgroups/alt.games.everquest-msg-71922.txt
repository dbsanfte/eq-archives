  Yes, there are some new textures for old zones which are improved
over the originals.  From the screenshots I've seen, not all textures
are improved, but many are.  Things like grass, walls, tree bark, some
signs, ect.  Also, of course, the overall look and feel of the game
improves if you turn on the new character models (if you happen to
like the way they look).
