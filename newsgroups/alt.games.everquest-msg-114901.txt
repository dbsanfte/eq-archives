I have found by far the best spot to hunt for spider silks is in CC in
tunnel to queen room.

I spent some time down there with my mage to get them.. I seen 3 drop
per spider  almost without fail. I have also seen as many as 6-8 silks
on some.  I collected 5 stacks of silk in about a hour to hour and a
half. Though they were deep green to him, he and his pet waded thru
them like a hot knife through butter.
