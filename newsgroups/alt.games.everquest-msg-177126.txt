Well I finally splurged the 10 bucks on the weekend and got the velious
expansion.  While I only had time to poke around the great divide it
seemed rather interesting.  Kited a few frost giant guys and evil wolves
then headed up to the dorf town to deposit some cash.  Look forward to
spending a bit more time in these zones over the next couple of weeks /
months or whatever.  Did run by a shadwurm (sp?) and cotemplated
attacking it seeing as it was  a blue con, but just based on size and
ugly factor I decided against it.

Aren't new expansions grand? :)
