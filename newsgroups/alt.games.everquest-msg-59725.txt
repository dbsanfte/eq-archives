    Luck. The purple bar is not that deep, and doesn't seem to go up as you
level. If I had to guess I'd say it's a constant 10 HPs in size (to match
the negative ten HPs thing from AD&D). But never underestimate your ability
to follow health bars. As a fun exercise, next time you're in an easy camp
(like almost anything with spiders in Velk's) and have no nukers in the
party, load up Holy Might or Force and see how many killshots you can get on
spiders. You might be surprised how good you are, especially if you've
played a melee and see how much damage per second they're putting out.
