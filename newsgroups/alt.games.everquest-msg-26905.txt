Well, the Paladin epic has a slightly different flavor than
many of the other classes' epics.

Most other epics are, "get huge crew together, kill something
incredibly dangerous, get a required quest item from it
every time (or close to it)", interspersed with "wait an
excruciatingly long time for other quest mobs that almost
never ever spawn".

The core of the Paladin epic is:

(52 and under):  Every week like clockwork, go on a Vox raid
and hope you kill her.  Watch the paladin quest item not drop.
The few rare times it does, watch one of the other 8 Paladins
on the raid win the roll for it.  Repeat forever.  Also repeat
all of the above with Nagafen, since you need *his* Paladin
quest piece also.

(53 and over -- since there's a level limit on Vox and Nagafen):
Repeat the above instructions, but substitute the names of
incredibly hard-to-kill Kunark dragons for Vox and Nagafen,
who *also* very rarely drop the required quest items.  Repeat
repeat repeat.

This isn't epic, it's a lottery:  "Young Knight, kill yonder 
dragon and his mate dozens and dozens of times until your 
number comes up".
