Things that irritate me from the Bible - God sticks Adam and Eve in
the Garden.  Right smack dab in the middle of this garden he put the
"tree of knowledge of good and evil" and tells them that if the eat of
the tree they "will surely die".  This is ALL the information god
gives them.  One could argue that if an omnipotent being tells you
something like this you should take it on faith that they mean it, but
if human history is about anything, it's about people sticking a fork
into the electrical outlet of the universe.  Anyway.  One would think
that god could have told them about a few other things, like "don't
listen to the snake, he's a dick".  But he didn't.

So the situation is this, god turns two children loose in the garden
and tells them DO NOT TOUCH THIS TREE.  Children who have no concept
of right and wrong.  Then he doesn't mention that there is this
bastard running around trying to make problems and, oh yeah, it would
be a bad idea not to listen to him because he can get really pissy.  

So, with all this neat stuff in place, the inevitable happens and Adam
and Eve eat from the tree.  Big shock there.  So, despite the fact
that he is omniscient, god acts all shocked and surprised and get
particularly pissy about this, despite the fact that, IMHO, he bares a
bit of the blame for the whole situation.  So, what does he do to his
beloved, specially created children.  Runs them off into the
wilderness, makes the soil difficult to grow food from, and greatly
increases women's pain during childbirth.  All because he couldn't put
a damned fence around the tree.

Let's not forget that the one piece of information god gave them about
the tree, eat it and die, is patiently false.  But that's another
gripe.

Or maybe I'm reading too much into it.
