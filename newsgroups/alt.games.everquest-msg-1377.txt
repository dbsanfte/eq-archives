I've never powerlevelled with a druid, but from my experience,
DEX/STR/AGI/STA and alacrity/chloro/talisman/guardian on Ray's 27 warrior
lets him kill even cons without breaking a sweat. And all he has to do is
get them to half health.  Snare hasnt been an issue since I blast em once
they reach that point.  By the time I stand and pivot to target what he
pulls, its half dead, thats no lie. Plus I can debuff red cons so he can hit
em if we want a challenge :)

Want a damage sheild? Here, have some Kilva's blistering Flesh potions.
Granted its not as good as a druids shield and it casts money, but that +
all the shammy buffs could be a close run. I'll have to try it, I have a
couple of 10 stacks of it left from raising Alchemy skill.

Oh man.. If I am grouped with a lot of melee types, I am generally kept busy
buffing. At 47, I prefer NOT to be the primary healer, as it is a horrible
waste of my abilities. Team me with a cleric and I keep all the tanks buffed
with str and dex (What they ALL want) as well as stamina and agi if mana
allows. If no enchanter I cast alacrity of the fighters and talisman.

I slow all of the mobs with Togors, and I toss in a Venom of snake if
appropriate, and send in my pet.

I NEVER put talisman on a caster. I had my butt chewed on that one once. :)
