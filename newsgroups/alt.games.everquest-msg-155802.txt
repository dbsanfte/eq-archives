Where have you been Dan?  Jak leveled a wizard up to his 50s, and has mostly
been playing the wizard for some time now.  I was wondering the same thing
regarding MB.  Things I know are that MB is fairly low aggro, so, perhaps
having someone else hold aggro, but that's still a long time.  Two minute
kill would imply 3 MBs max, assuming they got the one MB per minute working
properly.
