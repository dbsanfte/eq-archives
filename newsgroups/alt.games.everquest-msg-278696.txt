In the dungeons I would say grouping was very important, which is why I wish they had a lfp tool or at least a way of 
searching for others on the same quests, or of sharing a quest. Stormhold can be pretty empty and i was one of the few 
people in fallen gate the other night... and fallen gate solo is pretty scary if you want to get xp.

In thundering steppes, there are lots of groups, and group mobs. I don't think grouping is a problem there, despite the 
solo mobs, and frankly quests where you must kill 40 of a particular mob are tedious at best if you are not in a group. 
Some classes like the warrior ones do fine because they can fight a group at a time, but my predator, for example, can 
really only tackle one at a time, and relies on being grouped if he wants to use his main abilities more than once in a 
combat.
