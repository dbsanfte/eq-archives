Here's the thing, on Fennin Ro no noe camps CT anymore.  Way back, when I
was camping my DF Armor groups were plentiful, but if you applied Warrens
loot rules there now, SK's would get royally screwed.  Not to mention that
most Epics would become undoable.  Green mobs have just as much chace of
killing you as reds, so saying that there is no risk is stupid.  take a
level 60 anything, and plant him in Upper Guk in the Shin Lord room.  Sit
down and go afk and come back in like 10 minutes, chances are, you won't be
alive.  Or take a level 60 on a romp through green Kaesora and tell me there
is no risk.  Or do the same for Dalnir or Droga, or Nurga, or Green areas of
L Guk, or Sol A.  The risk is very real.
