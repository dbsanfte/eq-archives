Kaladim is really about the only high-xp reward quest for straight
bone chips that I can think of offhand. Lower the xp reward for it
(I've always felt it was too high anyway. Not that I didn't think it
was nice getting that hit, but it does make things too easy).

So, basicly, they're punishing necromancers for their own oversights?
