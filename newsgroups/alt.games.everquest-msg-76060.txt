I hate it. Sitting down everytime somebody of the 50 peeps on a major raid
asking me for one of the many shaman buffs, just for a spell exchange, has
nothing to do with any strategic thinking. The spells I use in the fights
in large groups are just different from the buffing spells. Hell, without
the group buffs, just the stat buffs, the HP buffs, the shield series, regen
and depending on a fight resistes would easily use up all 8 slots, while
when not buffing, I have healing, DD, slow and haste as well as root up.
This means I have to change at least one spell constantly somebody is asking
for a buff. This is just plain annoying. 2 slots more wouldn't be such a
bad idea. You might love it, but I don't see any positive aspects in this
and also nt eny that would make life too simple. Spare me all the 'I want
to be a warrior with haste root and DD' comments, they go to /dev/null.
