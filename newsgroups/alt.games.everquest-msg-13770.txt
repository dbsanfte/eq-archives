lol, that totally flew over your head.  The Guide was trying to make a
little roleplay-type explanation for the bug.  He didn't really mean you did
anything wrong.  You didn't really need to complain about the bug since shit
happens, move on, but I agree the guide probably shouldn't have asked if you
want to go back in that's a little over the sarcasm line IMO.  But he
wouldn't have been able to take you back in even if you said "ok put me
back" I don't think. I could be wrong about that though.
