Your corpse lasts longer at level 5.

As admirable as the brewing is, you should really save your money for now,
expecially for a magic weapon or Wu's Gauntlets so that you can kill wisps
in a few levels (10 or so)

You should go to the grassy area in North Ro, or into East Commonlands near
to Freeport.

Or just slaughter everything in existence in the newbie zone in Freeport (I
recommend the East Freeport newbie zone for this, less competition, and more
snakes if you're serious on the brewing)
