Exactly.  They put the lowest pop servers at the top, presuming them
to be most attractive to players choosing a server on the basis of
population.  You didn't really imagine that EQ's PvP servers were the
most populous, did you?  rofl.

Even tho you apparently weren't playing back when they showed actual
player populations (been a couple years since they quit that, I think)
You really ought to have had little trouble figuring out that the pop
rank listing is low to high, had you actually cared to know.

Karana is one of the most populous old servers, and yes it seems to have
a bias towards European players, where my old server Tunare has a bias
towards US players with a substantial Asian contingent.
