I hope so, Ross--at least there'd be something to *do* along the way.  I 
can't abide "dead" time, or what I consider dead time whether everyone else 
does or not.  And regarding what I play my considerations are the only ones 
that count. :-)

Anyway, this is the only one of the recently released/soon forthcoming 
MMOG's that has remotely piqued my interest, so if not it, then nothing.
