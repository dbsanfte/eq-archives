Actually, it's not possible to start a Dwarf Warrior with less than 75
agility.

It is a good recommendation though to bump it up to 80 (did that myself and it
has worked out fine) so you don't dip below 75 the second you get 1 stone
overweight.  (Or get a good item with negative 2 or 3 agility as one of the
stats.)
