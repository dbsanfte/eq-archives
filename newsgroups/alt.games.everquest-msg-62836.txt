It's actually pretty easy to see what EQ does server-side and
client-side. In the awful twilight between the moment you know your
connection has dropped, and when the PL-meter reaches 100% and your ass
is dropped out of the game, the *only* thing you can do is move. You
can't attack or cast spells, or trade items. Hence, you can see easily
that all those operations are carried out server-side.
