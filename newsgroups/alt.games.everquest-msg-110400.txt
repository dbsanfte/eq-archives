  It really depends on the guild you join, the people you associate with and
how much you put into initiating and finding roleplay.  The guild I'm in
isn't very roleplay heavy compared to the feeling I get from a few other
guilds, but many of us do roleplay.  Even in the uber and wannabe uber
guilds there are roleplayers.

  But you do have to look around a bit for it, usually.  I have stumbled
into a few roleplay scenarios in the past, but for the most part you still
have to find it or initiate it.  However, if you do try to find or initiate
something, you will often get a response, unlike other servers.

  If you just log on during your server's downtime, you may not get much out
of it... but it is a great full time server in my opinion. ;)  After playing
on FV I wouldn't want to play on a server with a normal ruleset.  I think
the caliber of player overall is better, and without rampant twinking, alts,
the low server population, ect. the game feels more like the way the game
SHOULD be, or what it was intended to be.  Of course this doesn't appeal to
everyone, but for the people who it does appeal to, it's hard to go back.
