Those precious few advantages are important enough for me that given the
choice to switch my monk with either a warrior or a rogue losing all
equipment , I would do so right now. Monks where not just broken they where
crucified and are pretty much unplayable now in a group. There raid utility
is still ok , but this leaves them with no avenue to gain exps.

I have 5 other characters over 50 so have a fallback class and am happily
playing my 65 chanter. Most monks will have no such recourse and are just
dead in the water.  There are of course those that will argue monks are fine
and all those monks calling for groups over guildchat for hours are an
abherration , even though those very same monks are long friends. My chanter
is keyed for valour , hoh , cod, and tt . My 59 monk could not even get
through the gimp exe trial. My 52 cleric got through easily . Even my 60
druid got through . Every warior got through easily along with every rogue ,
damn right i have some warrior envy skippy.
