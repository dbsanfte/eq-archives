The difference is that women don't feel the constant need to brag and boast
about everything they've seen and done.  I'm pretty sure it's because they
don't have a dick they need to swing around wildly in the air while thumping
their chests.
(Giggling hysterically.  Sometimes I crack myself up.  NO offense to the
average dick waving chest thumping man of course).
