This is just a question about what people do as it concerns loot for clerics
or group healers.  As a rule if I am in a group that is using the free for
all loot system I use autosplit of course but at the end of the group I
attempt to give the healer/cleric some pp as a courtesy.  Last night when I
did that the druid who was our healer and hadn't been looting said that I
was the first player who had ever done that with him.  Am I the minority
here or do others try and make the split more equitable for the healers who
don't get the opportunity to loot.
