Bullshit.  Was the lives of those in the buildings taken into account?  Who
is innocent?  Why are the lives of civillians worth more than
non-civillians?

The only morons are the idiots who refuse to act.  Someone just blew a hole
in the Pentagon, dillbert.  Action must be taken to prevent it from
happening again.  And the only action that these antagonists understand is
force.

Whether or not it was an indepent terrorist remains to be seen, but with the
sacks of human waste who now control the middle east, I highly doubt it was
anything less than a declaration of war.
