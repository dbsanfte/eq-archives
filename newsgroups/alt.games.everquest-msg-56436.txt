Good question,  part of how I make a living is by doing exactly this
sort of thing and if I screw up this bad its my ass. My guess right
now is the patch is reeking some kind of havok with the servers and
there is prob considerable debate going on even now about yanking it.
Just my wild-assed guess. Sure am glad it aint me over there today.

Cant say why they upgrade in this fashion but it does seem very odd
given the servers dont really interoperate that much as seen from
individual servers going down for maint.

Am rethinking getting too involved in this game though, Ive seen
similar things happen before in gaming and it smacks of piss poor
planning and growth management. Course it is a hell of a game since
not being able to play is really pissing me off...

All in all good question...wont get an answer but good question.
