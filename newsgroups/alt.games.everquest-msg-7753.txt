well untill this country looses all respect , what avenger said about the
military isn't anything new.  until i see a mass amounts of people enlisting
and server for love of thier country, then i think avengers comments should
be considered an insult.

Till then, well it seems to be the opinon of the general public.

Been there,
done that,
got the medals
