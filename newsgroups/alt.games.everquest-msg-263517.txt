Well yeah it's illegal in the real world, but there is no Sherman Act in 
Norrath. Price fixing has been pretty common in MMOGs for as long as I can 
recall. I remember selling spell scrolls in UO beta and establishing 
explicit prices on all spells with all the spell vendors. It's still going 
on now in EQ2, I don't think that desire will ever change. And in every case 
these systems last only for a short while and then someone comes in and 
starts "undercutting" to gain market share and everyone winds up 
commoditizing the business down to pricing. The best way to combat the 
initial attempts is to expand the influence of market forces right away and 
that's what happened here. Soon as real competition was given a chance, it 
cured the problem pretty fast. Competition is a wonderful thing. ;-)
