Had a similar problem with my cleric main in bazaar, trying to buy basic
armor from PC traders for my nephew's level 1 ranger...

The 'Buy' button grayed out when I clicked on certain items, though they
were all/all.ome items I clicked on. I went to other traders offering the
same item (at a higher selling price) and it would become available.
Finally, when I had the young ranger join me in Bazaar and handed him the
pp, he had no problem buying from those items from traders who wouldn't
allow me to buy their wares.

Still can't figure out why.
