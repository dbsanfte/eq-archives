I disagree, 21hp regen standing at 65 is noticeable and helpful, as I never
sit any more. Sure Q and cann5 is great, but I still cann4 in between
cann5's, and every bit of regen helps. Saying it isn't useful is like saying
don't bother with replenishment, and when you use replenishment along with
natural regen is awesome still.

I am a Iksar lover anyways, so the exp penalties didn't bother me, even when
the penalty was much worse. I enjoyed the ride, and now I reap the benefits
and aa has no penalty so its all good. Bottom line is play what looks cool
to you, they all function the same in the end, and any plus or minus can be
over come with gear and aa.
