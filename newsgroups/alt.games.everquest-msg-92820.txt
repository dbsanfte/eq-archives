Tradeskillers rejoiced as the launch of luclin also included a higher cap to
250 on their primary skill. Woohoo.
However, there are some, that cannot or will not for reasons of their own,
that do now have Luclin.

No problem, you still get the higher cap. Indeed, but no way of reaching it.
As a grand master fletcher I can no longer advance my skill because I cannot
go up to farm the necessary items. Nor am I a 140 skill smith, but that's
another problem all together.

My point being that once again, it seems that Verant did look before they
leapt. Half the player base can't use the upgrade to well and now the die
hard role players (as most tradeskiller tend to be, at least this one is)
are further alienated if they choose not to upgrade.

Damm Verant, is this all a grand test to see how far you can push us. Well
let me tell you, you can push as a whole lot further, we'll never leave, we
like EQ to much. But even the most conditioned puppy deserves a treat now
and again.
