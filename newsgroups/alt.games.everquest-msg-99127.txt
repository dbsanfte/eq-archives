Dump a big DS on the bard, pump the bard up with all buffs the druid has and
make sure druid is around to heal when things get messy. Now put on a damage
song and walk through some camps of mobs to pull them all. Use songdamage,
and the ds to kill several mobs at the same time. Heal with druid when
needed, but keep aggro on bard.

Some nice spots I think qualify: Bloodgills in LOIO, random mobs in Emerald
Jungle, Marus Seru (? euhm, the zone south of The Grey), Scarlet Desert,
Tenebrous Mountains, Twilight Sea, BnB of Upper Bats in SolB, Entrance to
Chardok in Burning Woods, just inside Chardok, velks Spiders, some stuff in
EW, ... think of something yourself :)


Another tactic: group up with the druid and let the druid quadkite stuff in
Cobalt Scar. Let the druid port around for C3 and put your bard on
autofollow or somesuch with manasong playing. constant quadkills make exp go
fast :)
