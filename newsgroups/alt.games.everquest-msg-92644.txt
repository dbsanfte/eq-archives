I agree completely.  That said, I'm not planning to move yet.  I'll give it
some time and see how it's going in a few months.

I remember when EQ first went non-beta.  It had no 9 year olds playing, and
it required the player to be an adult with a credit card.  Time passed and
and parents started letting their kids play.  Those kids told other kids at
school about it, and there were more kids.  Now it often seems like it's
high school age kids or younger (ie, mostly not the owners of credit cards).
The quality of the experience has sharply decreased and there's a feedback
loop -- as adults become more disenchanted (pun) because of the childish
behavior of the other players and find it harder and harder to play in
groups which understand what "tactics" and "courtesy" mean, they quit, and
the ratio gets even more child heavy.

So at first, of course, you're only going to see the people who have the
personal wherewithal to move to Legends do so.  In a year, the kiddies will
have convinced their parents that they need this other thing, and it will be
the same experience.

(Humans proliferate too much, the more humans you have involved in any
endeavor, the worse that endeavor becomes.  That's why I play a gnome. "You
humans have ruined Everquest, and you'll soon ruin Legends too.")  <grin>
