Kinda OT but... Horses blow
You would think that for 11k you would run at least as fast as tboots but i
barely ga faster than just running on foot. What a freakin gyp.
It seems pretty fraudulent to advertise on the Luclin bow Jouney the lands
of Norrath at blazin speeds on horses.
Is it lawsuit worthy since you are paying for the actual game and dont get
what the advertisment on the package says?
