You are way off on the successes Dan.  That's how I did it, I ended up with
8 to 10 stacks of fishrolls.  Of course, you are also off on the number of
attempts it took, but then, at the time, my Wisdom was 140ish.  I would
guess it was more like 800 attempts for me, but still, at 40pp to get to
135, it's one of the cheapest and easiest trade skills to raise.

Smithing - 175
Baking - 135
Brewing - 130ish
Alchemy - 90ish
Pottery - 50ish
Tailoring - 40ish (This is the skill that truely sucks to try to raise)
Fletching - not yet, but the shawl quests may force me into it, if I can get
past the tailoring.
