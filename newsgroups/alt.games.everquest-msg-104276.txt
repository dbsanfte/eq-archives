I made it to 12.  I'm wearing all patchwork armor.  I've made about 100pp
with pickbringer coifs and HQ bear pelts.  What should I do for armor.  Go
with banded?  Or are there specific items I should try to get in EC?
Remember I'm only 12 and I only have 100pp.  I wouldn't mind getting
something that will help now that I have to upgrade later.

Another question, are there any good quests I can do at my level?  Bardwise,
they all seem pretty high level.  I'm in EC right at the moment but I can
travel anywhere in in the old world or Kunark.  I don't have velious or
Luclin.

I've been to EQDiva but the armor and quests there are really high level.

Thanks,

Lewis
