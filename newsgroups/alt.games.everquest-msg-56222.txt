Unfortunately you can have 200+ Sta and a wurmy will drain it before a fight
is over, all the sta in the world won't help. If your sta is over 100 a lot
of people say it has no effect when it drops to 0, I personally disagree I
believe there is a slow down when your sta drops. I personally use a Sword
of Skyfire when not grouped with an Enchanter and the wurmy when I am and
ask for zing (invigor).
