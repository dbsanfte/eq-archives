Absolutely. Of course, you and I have an advantage here as a shaman and
beastlord, two of the more versatile classes. We can work with whatever
classes happen to be available. You grab the first couple you see, and if
you end up being the healer that can be okay or the haster or slower, you
can provide sow, you can add some DPS too....I can be a primary DPS source
or if I have a KEI can be the slower and now haster, actually I've even been
the puller for LDoN groups with my warder, and I can be the poor-mans buffer
if we don't have a shammy....

Now that I think on it, I often find myself invited to new-forming groups
begun by a druid, bard or ranger, I suppose for the same reason, they are
versatile classes that can move into different functions based on who they
pick up. A number of other classes can't really do that, so they probably
have a harder time filling in groups around themselves. (Even the
much-desired cleric can't get his group going if he can't find a tank class
or something). Particularly for LDoN adventuring, where once entering the
dungeon your group can't go cadge some fresh hastes or whatever from a
neighbor group.

Oh yes, please! I had started using my /ignore list for this but that's
really not optimal. You know what, after a couple of recent experiences
along these lines I think I'm just gonna go the paper-and-pencil route with
this.

Which reminds me: I've added maybe a half-dozen such never-group-with-again
names to my list in the last 3 or 4 weeks, and what's odd about it is that
all but one of them are tanks. In fact they are specifically either warriors
or shadowknights, there's no pallies on my s**tlist and only one non-tank.
Which is not to say that I haven't grouped with plenty of great warriors and
even a couple of good SKs, but still I wonder -- is there something about
the pure-tank role that attracts the young at mind? I actually find myself
now personally biased against SKs for LDoN groups that I'm forming, strictly
because it seems like my chances of ending up with a childish nitwit are
highest with that class. I suppose I must be overreacting but there it is.
