It's been done, servers are up. Make your own if you wish. Last real
project to work out is a decent private login server for a LAN, and
they have workable solutions for that already, just not real good
ones.

I can run 10 zones on a PIII/450 with 256Mb RAM and host 8 players
easily. When I load it on my dual PIII/1G with 512Mb RAM, I can host
much more. Design the world the way you want it, my Crushbone zones
from the slave caverns straight in to Najena, for example. Najena is
populated with mostly undead and a few Orcs and evil Dwarves
(Thurgudin Dwarves) Adding these models to the global file was the
hardest part, and thats a tad buggy (Sometimes I get a default Human
model). Point is, long before EQ fully dies, even if VErant won't do
it, others will have done it already.
 There are people dedicated to re-creating accurately all NPC and Mob
spawns per region.
