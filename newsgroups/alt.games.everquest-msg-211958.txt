First the bigger hit point pool is not always an advantage. If you have a
druid or a shammy healing their ghetto Cheal is just as efficient on a pally
as it is on you. Additionally the fact that you are taking far more damage
from a unslowed mob than a knight would on a slowed one.
People (not just casters) prefer knights in most xp situations is because
they can kill faster with more efficiency. Not having to wait 5 or 10
seconds for you to establish agro means that's 5 or 10 seconds more that
they are doing damage which means the fight lasts 5 or 10 seconds less.
Which can add up over the course of 50 mobs. Example as an Archery Ranger I
do about 150dps so 750-1500 points of damage lost waiting around for you to
establish agro. The slowers can't slow as early meaning which completely
negates your advantage in hit point pool and mitigation. You do not have 70%
more hit points than a Knight nor do you mitigate 70% more efficiently than
they do. And a shammy slow on inc means that the mobs damage output is
reduced by 70% by the time they start beating on anyone. It also means their
debuffes are landing 5-10 seconds earlier which means that the mob is doing
even less damage.

Now if one were too look at the situation from the narrow view you are doing
so then you'd be correct. If there were no slowers then yes a warriors
mitigation and damage absorbtion advantages would make the warrior a no
brainer choice for MA.

However that narrow view is not how things really work. Slow is a huge deal
in the upper levels of pop. As hard and fast as those mobs hit a slower is
pretty damn essential for any traditional melee centric group (for agro
kiting it doesn't much matter but plate clases are pretty damn useless in an
agro kitting group anyway)

Slow is the difference between fast steady kills (everyone's goal) and
massive amounts of down time and lots of chatting while you wait for mana to
regenerate.

If you ever get to say BOT you'll find people are more than happy to have a
group with out a cleric for a healer, A druid can do the job well enough to
keep a group going and druids are a dime a dozen. Hell you can even keep a
group going with the shammy healing. But if you loose your slower that's
pretty much it. If you can't find another slowing class your packing it up
saying see ya later and either logging or throwing up your LFG flag. Perhaps
a warrior could continue to tank with a cleric healing under that situation
but you're gonna soak up mana like a ranger and the group is going to end up
with tons of down time while your cleric tries to keep enough mana to get
through each fight. And with out a slow any casting classes are going to
poof the second they get any agro. Which means they're gonna have to be even
more cautious so as to not take agro from you meaning they're going to do
even less damage resulting in longer fights and more Cheals and more mana
spent by the cleric keeping you standing.
The class that is made more mana effictient by using a warrior for a MA in a
standard xp situation is a cleric. And even that can be effected if you have
alot of ping pong cause you can't agro as well as a Knight as the cleric is
having to drop HoTs and quick heals on other party members. Beyond that
there are 4 other characters in the group who have to work below their max
capabilities in order to make up for your difficiencies.Caster can't nuke or
DoT as often or early (meaning less damage ergo longer fights ergo more
heals ergo more mana spent) Rogues have to be more careful with their
backstabs, monks spend more time fiegning death, Rangers spend more time
jolting and less hitting. And of course slowers can't slow and debuff as
often or early meaning more damage during the fight meaning more time spend
recharging the clerics mana pool.

Now don't get me wrong when the choice is between a warrior for a tank or no
plate tank at all the warrior will get the spot. But if the choice is
between a warrior and a knight all other things being equal the smart group
will pick the Knight and if they have both in a group then the Knight will
be the MA. Even if the choice is between a well equiped warrior and a
modestly equiped knight. Because the spells that knights use for agro
generation are available to all of them and it takes some pretty hellacious
equipment for a warrior to equal those abilities.

Also the warriors job of supreme tank is secure. When its time to take out
that raid mob warriors are the tank of choice. Their innate damage
absorbtion advantages make them not only the best choice but often the only
real choice.

But the fact still remains that for an XP group a knight is superior,
Because other classes don't have to play below their abilities to make up
for dificiencies in a warrior.
