hi,

I seem to be having a problem with chat channels. I was on a naggy
raid last night on seventh hammer, and tried to join the raid channel
by typing the following....

/join channel:password

It started working for about 10 seconds, then stopped working
completely. From then on any command like /join again, /leaveall, or
/list does not do anything at all. Nothing is displayed and nothing
happens. I have had the same problem many times in the past with the
old or new UI on different computers believe it or not. No one in the
game seems to know whats going on. I was quite pissed last night
because the raid took a few hours and I was totally out of the loop.
In fact, it was my first naggy raid and im a bard and I missed the
message to play resist songs because the dragon has nasty fire based
spell. It killed nearly my whole group (probably thanks to me.) Anyway
I've looked in EQ support no luck there. Please help!

thanks
