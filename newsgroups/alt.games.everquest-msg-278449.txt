Being once the prime object of derision for off the usual targets
for raiding. 

Here's my list of suggested doable probably targets

Semi-Old World.
Ring of Slime in CT.
Triggered dracoliche thing at the top of the pyramid in CT. semi
suck item trigger camp tho.
Culthor in SolC maybe...
Head to the top of Sky, just to say you've done it!

Kunark:
Koru in ChardokB. Nice drops not horribly vile either.

Velious:
Try Vindi and KT.  I can't speak about Statue/Idol/AoW
Try Sont. :)  After you've done some HoT crawling if you
wan't to do HoT that is.  If not. whack Sont and poke into
NToV.  After getting past Aary you should be ok, there's still
some kinda nice drops in NToV.
Try Lord Bob and Velketor too.

Luclin:
Some of the Akheva named should be doable. Avoid Shei.  DTs blow.
Radir/Tawro in UP should be eminenetly doable
We tried doing Grieg once with 1.5 groups pre-PoP and if there hadn't
been a brain fart he'd have died.  He's probably doable.
Try Rumblecrush and the Robe thing in UP too, and the honkin' big
Zelniak.
I keep meaning to get the folks interested in doing Khati Shah but
that's probably of nil interest. :)
THO should be doable don't know about burrower, the multi worm
spawns could be ugly.
Seru maybe.

PoP:
Ring of Frog in Storms is kinda fun.
Falto, not sure about the drops. could be ugly too.
Maybe the port up event Mujaki, not hedge maze, thing in PoN.
I'm leaving off Hammer because he's still kinda vile, but getting
through all the PoJ trials is fun.
Try the Protos in PoI. Junk beast is kinda fun too.
Xanamech if you have a pretty solid heal chain.
HoH Trials, the erm Villagers? if you have some good kiters should be doable.
Glykus in Tactics if you can get folks in.  Same with Armorer, overseer,
and Supplier.
HAL in the PoN caves is interesting to do once. :)
Vhaksiz the Shade is probalby doable.
Paffa in Decay could be interesting or over the top.

Ykesha:
Nadox Inny. That's a fun event.
I hesistate to suggest the Captain event in Hate's Fury because the trigger
camp (damn stupid rare booze drop) is kinda painful and if you blow it
you are hosed.
