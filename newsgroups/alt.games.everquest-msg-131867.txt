Pain and Suffering is an "invisible" mob. It can't be seen with see invis
and only agroes under certain conditions. I would always end up dying to
pain in suffering with my warrior in Dagnor's Cauldron after having the
Undertow Skel bring my life down a bit. VI is prolly using P&S in the Hole
to deal the appropriate amount of falling damage after crossing the zone.

As for the zone-in to SK of the OP, either he was poisoned (as another
replier proposed), low on health, or suffered a bug.
