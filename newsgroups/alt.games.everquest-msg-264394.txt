Hehe yes, the irony would not be lost on me. :-p Though technically
alchemy "worked", in the way that if the dev buffed themselves up in
skill to test it out, it worked, I guess there was no actual in game
way to get that skill. Took months, maybe even into the second year
before that goofup was found.

The lesson was that you listened to the players about bugs, though!
