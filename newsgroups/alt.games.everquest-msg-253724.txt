Huh? I don't know how long you have been following this newsgroup, but 
hughes *does* see Socialists everywhere, including under his bed, behind 
the courtain, and in the broom cupboard. If he ever visited Europe, his 
head would spin so fast it would probably detach and take off.

I do agree with him on occasion and have no problem admitting it, and in 
this particular instance I happen to agree with him as far as nuclear 
energy goes; but it's true that he's not generally one to let facts get 
in the way of rampant paranoia.

Refute? If I argued there's a 6.000-mile long lawn gnome orbiting the 
Sun on the opposite side from Earth, how would you refute that argument? 
Same with hughes's conspiracy theory.
