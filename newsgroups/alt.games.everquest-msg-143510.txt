No, the best thing to do would be to put an insta click buff in the
top slot and take off all your MR gear!  This would mean your instabuff
would fail its save and be the one that gets dispelled, instead of it and
several others getting "lucky" and the dispell finally paying off when it
is down somewhere in your Aego/SOE/KEI section. I'm not convinced
that this IS the way it works, but if it is its going to make for some odd
tactical choices.

Fear kiting works great too.

Funny thing about those chromodracs, though, in the past 40 times
they have dispelled me I've actually lost a buff about 6 times... cause
what they do is chain cast boiling blood and dispell... which seems
to be the first thing dispelled!  Only if I happen to resist boiling
blood do I ever lose a buff.  This doesn't make sense with your
"goes down the list" plan, though, unless the dispell is based
not on -my- MR, but on that of the caster or something for
"bad" effects.  Come to think of it, I've never resisted a dispell
I've cast on myself, while I've resisted any number of other "bad"
spells cast on myself... even when I want them to stick.
