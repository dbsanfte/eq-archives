Anyone out there using or have used or know of someone using a 2-way
Satellite Internet connection to play EQ?
My suspicion is that it would be plagued with lag big time, but a RL
experience can go a long way to belay my fears.
You see I'm considering getting one of these, as terrestrial based
high-speed Internet is not to be found in my neck of the woods.
