Having played very little in PoP, I thought it was about time to see more of
them. I know I can get inside the "basic" planes, but some require flags
achieved through trials. (Not soloable, I know, but getting together enough
ppl. should be possible).
Are there any websites out there that explain all trials for all planes?
I've tried Allakhazam, but it seems to be a bit confusing regarding the
planes trials.
Besides, I got one of those Wooden Figurines for the charm slot, but
naturally it has absolutely no stats right now. Any chance of improving its
stats through trials doable with only one group?

Thanks,

Lalor Windrider
