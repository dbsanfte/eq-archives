Yeah, I see your point in a way. People are selling cash on some sites
anyway, selling items, scamming, etc. Like it or not, like any urban
area, EQ now has a seedy underground element. At least if they had
NPC run casinos, people would be gambling but not actually getting
scammed by the house per se (while there is always a chance for 
that to happen in these player run Ec tunnel games)

The horses already ran out, closing the barn door now is a bit late.
