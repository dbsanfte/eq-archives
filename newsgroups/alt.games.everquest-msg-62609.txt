Played around with the pet some last night, and this
does work.  I cleared out orc 1 in EC by hitting a cent
with my staff, then casting UHOF, then walking around
the camp hitting every other orc there.  The pet would
kill one after another while they all either kept trying
to hit me (800+ AC and over 2300 hp, I really wasn't
concerned about what they could do) or decided to run.
Pet tracked back to me handily and found the next target,
it was all over in 30 seconds.

I also helped some friends hunt HG with it in RM,
it does about twice the damage I'd thought, it seems
it double attacks.  On green mobs like HG, it hits
for 50 50 more often than anything else, was outdamaging
the 47 ranger I was with.  I managed to make use of
the "as long as I have something to do I'll stick around"
feature by grabbing a second giant on my own while
pet and ranger were finishing off the first.

The Hammer works like a chanter pet, listens to no
commands at all, picks its own target out of those
attacking you.  On the plus side, it does -not- taunt,
and almost never manages to grab aggro, so it
tends to live.  It also attacks the caster's target when
cast, which is an improvement over chanter pet,
if you are using it on just one target you don't have
to figure out how to grab aggro and then use it.

I also took the pet out to GD and fear kited Elites
at the fort, where the pet was definately turning in
more damage for the mana than doing a couple
nukes; kills were taking long enough that the
investment was paying off even if we couldn't
get it to switch to a second target.

Casting over 30 pets over the course of the day,
I only had two killed by a mob, both when
fear broke and the mob managed to riposte.
Although I'm told it has 100 hp, an 85 point
riposte managed to kill it one of those times.
A third time it took a 125 point riposte and
kept on going, so there must be some variation
to the HP on the things.

Facing very low level mobs like the bandits
in LRathe, it seemed to have a high enough
AC that they could not kill it despite its
having fewer HP than it.  100 damage
every 3 seconds did make pretty quick
work of them, of course, and there was no
way to force any but the first bandit to aggro
onto it... well, I guess I could have rooted
the others and backed off...

All in all, its not as lame as I thought... but
its certainly situational.
