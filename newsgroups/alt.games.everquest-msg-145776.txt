I get that from groups a LOT.  Pisses me off, but I can see their point.  
Most rogues I've grouped with have eventually mentioned in our private 
conversations "oh yeah, I PP *all* the time, you should too."  Yeesh.  
When I'm in a group I *either* loot *or* (if there's a monk not wanting 
autosplit on in the group) pickpocket.  I still get idiots arguing that 
I make more than my fair share that way - yeah, because the 2 silver or 
gold pieces I get *when* are really, reeeeally valuable.  If I want to 
make money, I'll ninja-loot like the rest of the group and grab the fine 
steel weapons, thanks :P
