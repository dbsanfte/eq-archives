It isn't anarchy if it's peaceful.  But even overlooking that,
capitalism requires a medium of exchange, else there is no
capital to invest, so now you want a "peaceful anarchy with
money", a situation I would love to see described in sufficient
detail to be believable (no, I am most certainly <not> holding
my breath until it happens).  The natural state of trade in
anarchy is barter.  Peacefully inclined anarchists will barter
goods and services for others' goods and services, non-peaceful
anarchists will barter in classic mugger style:  "give me your
stuff and I won't kill you".

Totally free markets reward anti-social behavior (monopolism, etc.),
which is why they never last long when attempted.  There's never a
shortage of assholes ready to fuck things up for everybody else.
