It was you who spoke of "curing them of their need for recognition". It's 
my understanding that a need for a cure implies the existence of a disease.

Again, a need that you appear to think they need curing of.

Yeah, I love cats too. And I bet you don't ask your family to use 
"gentle sarcasm" on you whenever they see you petting the cat in order to 
"cure" you of that psychological need... And yet, that's exactly what you 
say you do when you respond to a Ding.
