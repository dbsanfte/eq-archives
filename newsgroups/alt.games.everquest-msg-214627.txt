For starters, rolling with a blow is much more effective with a blunt 
weapon than with a piercing or slashing one. 

For enders, you cannot roll with a blow(or block, or do anything requiring 
flexibility or agility) nearly as well as in plate as in leather.

This is fine, but now we are back to monks mitigating more damage, while 
warriors can simply take more.

Well, who is?

This is with a slashing weapon. A foil can make short work of a man in full 
plate, as it can ferret out the holes that a slashing or blunt object 
cannot. As for chain, before padding was worn underneath, chain accounted 
for as many deaths as it prevented. Sure, your arm is still on, but now you 
have rusty or at the list dirty metal embedded in the hamburger meat that 
once was your shoulder, thus leading to gangreen, etc. On the other hand, 
good chainmail (note: not ringmail) will stop a piercing object fairly 
well.
