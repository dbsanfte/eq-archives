There's a shark out in the water who paths near the docks. Gawd, it's
been ages since I've been there, but I think it's "a plague shark". That
may be wrong, though. Anyway, unless they fixed him, he would always get
to a certain point in his pathing and suddenly appear like 10 feet over
the water and "swim" past the boat and the docks where I was usually
fishing while medding. Then he'd make it past that buggy portion of his
path and disappear back down into the water. I don't recall what level
he is, but it's up there. I don't mean a little higher than you. I mean
red to you in your thirties, and a nasty customer.  

The good news is that his "flying" routine is only a video trick and he
won't aggro on you if he flies over you. He's really still in the water.
Just steer clear of him.
