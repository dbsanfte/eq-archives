The DA cleric works if he is 65, maybe 64.  there are 2 KoS to everyone mobs
down there now to get past the hole mule route of CRing.  IF he is high
enough level he wont agro the mob.  I know it works with a 65CLR he told me
he didn't try it between 56 and  65 because he got ate at 55.

You can also have eather a Necro or a Shadow Knight sumon your corpse for
you.  There are 2 diferent spells that they can use to summon your body,
depending on there level. Both of them require a diferent component that
have a stiff cost.

If you find a Necro that is over Lvl 39 or a SK that is over 51 they can use
the spell Summon Corpse to summon you. This sumons requires a Jade Inlaid
Coffin which will cost about 150 Plat and is a Container.

If you are lucky enough to find a Necro over Lvl 57 or a SK that is LVL 65
and Has the Spell Conjure Corpse, it will be much cheaper at 70P for the
component ( Tiny Jade Inlaid Coffin )

IF none of these work you can always buy a Crypt Master`s Conjuring Stone
that has one charge of Conjure Corpse ( these sell for about 20K on TZ )

Best bet go to PoK send out a OOC that you want to buy a Summons in the hole
and that you will get the component.  they sell in the Bazaar from the
vendors.
