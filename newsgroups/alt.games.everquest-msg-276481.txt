Ok, I'm being lazy and not reading the replies so far.

Unless she's changed, Gore hangs out between Karnors and the tunnel to the 
port-in area.  It's not going to take a whole lot of tracking.  In fact, if 
you just port in nowadays (what with the Fabled crap going on) you should be 
able to just ask the zone.

But, barring that, obviously rangers have the best tracking.  However, 
"parking" a lowbie anywhere in DL might be a tad harrowing experience 
(though I'm sure there are plenty of safe spots...once you find a good spot 
to track from).
