My opinion (I have an asshole, too, fancy that) is drop fear and gate, add
Gather Shadows and Shadow Step.  Always, always Leach just before the mob
dies.  You get full benefit even if the mob dies 1 sec after casting.  That
way you can keep Dark Pact up.  While fighting undead, drop Poison Bolt in
favor of Ward Undead.

Hunt Well
