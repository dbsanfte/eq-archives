Couldn't resist this topic.
Friend and I were discussing solo classes - he plays a druid. He was
bragging about how well they solo and PL etc. Then we both decided that
although my mage can not TP and is not a good PL, those can be advantages. I
never have to go /roleplay or /anon. I never get bugged for TPs. The most I
get is tells asking for advice on where to lvl or where certain words drop
and an occasional request for bandaids/coldstone/pet weapons/mod rods. Of
course once i get CotH I will be a little more popular for groups but, so
far I really haven't needed a group and have solo'd except for grouping with
guildies for fun and raids. So maybe mages are a better solo classes because
they don't get bugged and can solo without interuptions, hehe.
