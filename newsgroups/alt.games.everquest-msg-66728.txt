Dx 8.1 comes default with xp

"Ed van" <edvan@??hotmail.com> wrote in message news:3c132b96$0$2582$afc38c87@news.optusnet.com.au...
Recent update of Everquest has forced me to update my version of Direct X,
I downloaded the new version (8.1) from Microsoft and installed it but the
game
would still not work. I then loaded up dxdiag and found that version 8.0 was
still
installed, I tried to reinstall 8.1 several times but it didn't override the
old one.

I then looked in add/remove programs and couldn't find Direct X there, I
think it
comes default installed with XP. Does anyone know how I could remove it, or
how I can get the new one installed?

Cheers!
