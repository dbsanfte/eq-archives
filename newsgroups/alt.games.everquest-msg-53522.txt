I've only fought there once, with my warrior when he was level 18, I think.
We had a group of 5 the whole time, I think, and held it just fine, after I
explained about assisting.  Warrior, Paladin, Mage, Wizard, Ranger are what
I remember ( severe lack of healing ).   We rotated a few out and a druid
and a chanter in.  The druid didn't speak much English, but I can understand
German, so it wasn't bad.

The group finally broke up and I was about to head out when I got jumped by
a Medic ( or whatever the Cleric Orcs are ).  I was smacking him around and
got an add or two.  Next thing I know, my life bar goes to full and I say
"Thank you very much!".  Medic drops, adds drop ( after another heal ).  I
turn to see a 51 or so Druid ( been a while, don't remember ).  I thank him,
and he buffs the Hell out of me.  I decide to hang a kill a few more while I
am buffed, and do so.  The druid stays and keeps healing me.  I kept
thanking him, he barely said a word, and I even asked him why he was being
so nice.  He never answered that.  A french mage ( heh ) shows up and wants
to join me, so I invite him.  We kill some more, and I let him loot
everything.  I did 4 yellows in NO time at all.  The druid finally leaves
after much thanking by me.  I never have anything of value to offer people
like this, so I always offer my services in the way of errands or whatever,
but he just smiled, declined, and left.  Before the mage got there, I took
down a named orc with a Halberd ( Shiny Halberd? ).  I'm still looking for
someone to give it to.

It was fun in the group when we all got on the same page.  A little intense,
now and then, but fun.  No CRs, with the zone there, and only had to zone
before I got the group organized.
