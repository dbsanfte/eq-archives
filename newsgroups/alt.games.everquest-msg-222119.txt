As a former AC vet, I would say that EQ Will blow your mind. There is
however one Caveat. You will NOT be able to solo as well as you canin AC,
and the down time in EQ will, at first, seem real bad. Youll quickly get
used to that though, and if you learn the mechanics of grouping, or even
liked it in AC then you should do well.
