So I dinged 29 with my wizard last night. Sadly, all my spells were in
the bank. As soon as I dinged, I did the lesser evac to take us to the
NK bridge to wait for the spires to go up to the bank in the Nexus. And
I mean, <as soon as I dinged>. No sooner had I landed by the bridge, I
immediately got a tell. (Must have been a good.... thirty seconds from
when I dinged over.)

[sic] "Can u take us to G Fay plz. Were at KFC by big tree."

I will now go write the following on the blackboard five hundred times:

"I will not badmouth 'whiny druids' anymore."
