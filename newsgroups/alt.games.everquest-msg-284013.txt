I like your sense of humour  :D

Yes, the potions have made a HUGE change in the game.  Pulls are, as
you say, nearly always non-stop.  My Ranger can solo well at 42 even
in zones where mobs hit hard, like just now in Great Divide.  I
remember a year or two back, even my Beastlord (at 42) would have been
unable to fight so long without a break, and that's with a pet.  Dark
blue Dire Wolves are almost riskless now - still good for the Veeshan
faction, of course  :)

I also note that most of the days I was on EQ (say about the last
seven) Enchanters - as a class - are hard to find in PoK.  Sometimes
there's as few as 2 or 3, and even now (8pm in the UK) there's only 5
in PoK.  I wonder if the Clarity potions are affecting the popularity
of Enchanters as a class?  I hope not!
