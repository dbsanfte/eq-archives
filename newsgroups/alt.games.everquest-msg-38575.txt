You've seen his cock? wow.. intimacy.

;)

Reminds me of that line from Happy Gilmore

"I eat little shits like you for breakfast"

"you eat shit?"

".... no" *runs away*

They only ban that account, which is then deleted I suppose after some
time. The person is free to buy a new everquest/kunark/velious and
start a new account which could then also later be banned.

They don't ban you by name, ip, credit card, etc and if they did
frankly that would be easy to get around since they can't ban you by
IP since they know that it would ban several players as many people
don't have static ones, they can't ban you by name since obviously
there could be a few thousand John H. Smiths, they could ban you by
credit card but if they did I'd have a new checking account with a new
visa check card tomorrow (fully useable for EQ) Address of course you
can use a non real one.

Again, they only ban the account.
