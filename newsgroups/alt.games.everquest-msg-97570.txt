I resent the dumbing down, period.  EQ was special because it was harder
than the games that tried to compete with it.  Unfinished and broken do
not enter into my feelings on the subject, rather my concern is that
these changes are just the first step.  This new generation of players
will learn to play in a much easier world with fast exp and reduced
death penalties.  When they get to higher levels content will need to be
dumbed down for them at those levels in order to retain them.  Once you
start making things easier you have to continue or it seems even harder
than if you'd done nothing.  Thats my issue.

If they were trying to increase numbers I don't think they would be
making such aggressive changes at the risk of losing some of their best
customers, the ones who stayed with EQ because it was harder, not in
spite of it.  No, this would appear to be a repositioning designed to
appeal to the folks who don't play now.  I honestly believe this is an
advance effort to build up a new player base to replace SWG defectors so
their spreadsheets don't go all ugly on the EQ side come next winter, as
I don't see anything else on the  horizon that can be expected to syphon
off subscribers.
