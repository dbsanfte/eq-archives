Karma is a wonderful thing.

We had a badly failed Vox raid, *lots* of bodies all over the zone,
and the raid "leader" (I use the term loosely) hadn't prepared
at all for possible failure, so lacking the knowledge of
how to do dozens of CR's from under an angry dragon, *and*
not having left himself any free time after the raid for
such a contingency, he logged, leaving the rest of us to
clean up the mess.  It took us until 6am the next morning,
and many people's corpse timers ran out, leaving them
with no recovered exp on *multiple* deaths.

The next evening, a more competent raid leader led us to
victory against Vox, and the S.O.B's fully dressed corpse 
from the previous night was still lying there on the floor
of Vox's lair.  You wouldn't believe the number of people
who made a point of going over to it to /rude it, or worse.
