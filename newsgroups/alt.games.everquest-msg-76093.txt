Maybe not... I pulled a nibbler in Dalnir and not only Riposted it while 
running back to the room, but also got a skill-up in Offense at the same 
time.  Can't beat that while having your back turned to the Mob!

My attack wasn't even on, as I was pulling with a bow.

A guy in my Guild got all his melee skills up on the Soulbinder this 
weekend.  I sure hope he doesn't get banned.
