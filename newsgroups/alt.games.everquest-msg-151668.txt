This is right, as far as it goes.  Mobs often pop randomly off a table, and
are  replaced again randomly off same table when they die.  So if you kill
a mob off that table, you either get that same mob or you get another type
of mob to spawn.  Even if you got 9 mobs out of 10 as spiderlings, in you
example, the spiderling population in the zone would gradually drop if
all you kill is spiderlings.

While zone repop does re-roll every mob spawn in the zone, they aren't
doing so to get the "right" numbers.  They are doing it because something
unintended has happened, normally a vendor or quest mob trained out
of place sor something along those lines.  The mob population redistribution
effect appears to be deliberate, one of the interesting underlying mechanisms
behind the scenes in the game that make it more immersive.

This sort of thing does happen in many zones, but not to all mobs or to
all zones necessarily.  One interesting place where it happens it in EW,
where the mobs "snow griffins" and "snow bunnies" are on the same
table.  Snow griffins are 40s level mobs that drop a quest item (griffin
eggs) and are often hunted... to extinction.  Because of the mechanism
you describe, killing griffins leads to an increase in the snow bunny
population.  If you kill bunnies (a level 3 mob that I think few but
me ever hunted for experience) you gradually increase the griffin
population.  Sadly, what often happens it you kill bunnies, and
others reap the rewards by killing the griffins you spawned!
