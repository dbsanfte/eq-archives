   Thank you.  I wasn't really trying for a mega-thread.  
I actually did write out the list on a whim as I sat
medding and annoyed.  
   I was annoyed over fairly trivial things.  I was 
playing my mage...wandering around the Nek forest 
looking for bears and skellys to kill.  A level 2
cleric at the wizard plat was spamming the zone, 
asking for someone to PL him for 90pp.  I never 
responded, since I can't think of anything more boring
than PL a stranger.  Then, he sends me a tell, asking
me if I want to group with him; he throws in that he's
heavily twinked.  I say politely say no, not
interested.  He sends me about 3 more tells, all
containing multiple "plz"'es.  My politeness factor
begins to drop, but I don't resort to name-
calling.  Finally, he gives up.  Minutes later,
he shouts "Ding 3".  
   I ding 7, and head to Ecommons.  It's getting
late, and I'm about to camp.  Before I do, I run
across "Cheezychik", who is PL someone at the 
undead ruins (don't know her level, but she was
red to me).  No, I didn't petition, but if I 
were staying on longer, I may have.
   Anyways, in about an hour and a half, I ran
across about four of the things on my list.
The bit about inspecting?  Threw that in at the
last minute, because I originally miscounted
and only had 9 items.  If I had come up with 
something else on that whim, I bet this thread
would have been about _half_ the size.
