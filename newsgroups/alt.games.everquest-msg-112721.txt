Ah, good, caught you before you made a big expensive mistake.  Unless you
can enchant your own metals (enchanter) and have at least 110 CHA
(enchanter) it's going to be even more expensive than if the right class
(enchanter) does it.

If you're new to tradeskills I'd recommend one that is cheap & easy to
master and has immediate benefit - baking.  Oh, I don't mean don't do OTHER
trade skills, but baking will give you a great taste (pardon the pun) of
what tradeskills are REALLY like and it won't break the bank like
jewelcrafting, smithing, alchemy, tinkering, etc.
