Like I said, sometimes it's for legitimate reasons. Mostly that
legitimate reason is the loss of damage output making it difficult or
impossible to maintain agro, at least a little of it is being snared
and taking longer to get to the mob that does break away.

However in most situations the Tank can in fact maintain agro while
under torpor, even if he is under torpor for the entire fight. If they
are having trouble maintaining agro without torpor, you would have to
be insane (or very desperate) to start using it.

Torpor and Stoi used to strip off your Haste, not only reducing you to
unhasted level but also reducing you by about 30% on top of that.

However now, all it does is take 30% off of your hasted speed. So you
are still doing 20% more damage than your unhasted self, because I
cast celerity on you before the fight. So even a warrior can hold agro
in most groups. Paladins (the ones worth their salt anyways) are chain
stunning throughout the battle anyway, so there is no reason not to
use torpor on them, except that it still pisses most of them off, and
it's too much trouble explaining to them that torpor keeps them alive
if we get an add, otherwise we all die.

If the main tank still has agro while I malo, slow, and double dot,
(first of all I applaud you) then casting torpor on him isn't going to
get me, or anyone else any agro unless they really trying hard to make
a point. But then again, if the tank can do that (as just about every
tank in my guild can) then usually there isn't much need for me to be
casting torpor unless things go in the crapper. Generally the
additional 30% damage far outweighs even the stunning mana efficiency
of Torpor.
