Some mage-centric possibilities -

Mage/Shammy - Mage provides DPS and Shammy provides slows to keep pet from
tanking unslowed mobs (difficult in PoP).

Mage/Beastlord - Probably even better.  Two DPS classes and the mage can
debuff mobs to keep BL slow resists to a minimum.  You have a tradeoff
between Shammy buffs to the mage pet and  "kitty crack" to the mage.  In my
experience, increasing the mage's mana regen (and thus nuking ability) is a
better investment at high levels.

Mage/Ranger - Oh, the aggro/fear kiting possibilities.

Other -

Druid/Wizard - sounds like a quad-kiting wrecking ball to the mobs of
Norrath.
