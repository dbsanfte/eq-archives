Yup, the stuff outside the door.  It was very disorganised to my mind. 
The group I was in did not talk to each other.  I told them this was my 
first raid and that I was happy to listen to any and all advice, 
instructions etc.  Nothing.

I had a window for the raid channel, a window for a 'chat' channel which 
was called for everyone to join and my group channel.  I found there to 
be too much to read from various people to keep up with instructions, so 
obviously I needed to filter something/somehow but heaven knows what.

All groups where numbered, but know idea why as no specific instructions 
were given.  To start, from zone in, a simple 'Right, everyone zone' was 
called.  Now, as a newbie to this that said to me that we were going to 
hit some form of 'zone line' again.  No, just move along and up to the 
set of doors.  In one big bloody mess.  I tried to keep with my group 
leader, thinking that was sensible.  Next thing I know we are dealing 
with some mobs at bottom of ramp to door.  Seemed OK, I /assist MT just 
for something to do!  I mean, I was buffed to high heaven (only two 
empty slots iirc) so why not do something.

Next command was move to door, did that, door opened so I went in. Stood 
for perhaps 30s thinking 'what next'.  Then saw a call for people back 
outside to deal with some mobs - this is where Mr Cockup started to 
play.  Being a helpful type and seeing few people moving to help, I went 
to help.  Sure enough several big mechanoid things beating on people. 
Targeted one and started nuking for all a poor druid can!  Mob went 
down, so did the other *I could see*.  Went back in as door was closing.

Summoned outside by another mob I had not seen nor had I nuked.  Thump, 
thump, cast hea.......dead.  From here on it was just chaos.

Looking back on things this morning, having 'calmed down', what I should 
have done was just sat inside, kept mouth shut and simply tagged along 
for the flag.  Selfish, what quite a few seemed to be doing (I saw one 
comment later of 'All rangers move to xx and get groups sorted else you 
will be considered as just tagging along for a flag' followed by a 
comment, not from a ranger' of 'There are people who ARE just here for 
flag') but not my style.  I like to help out towards the objective.

Ho hum, I shall be interested to see what is in guild chat when I log in 
today :)

I'll take your word for it.  First and last raid for me.  I will just 
potter along as a solo druid, grouping with the odd friend/guildee when 
bored and do my own thing.  Slow, yes.  Fun, has been so far.  Will I 
get to L65, maybe who knows.

Change of action for today, think I will go do some baking, just to 
raise skill really and for something peaceful to do :)
