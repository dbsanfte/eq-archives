Hi everyone,

I use mouselook a lot ( wandering around with my right mouse button clicked
down ) as I find it more easy to control movement while I'm travelling.
However constantly holding down the right mouse button does get a bit
wearing after a while :)

I'm wondering, is there a way to set mouselook to work on a key being held
down or a key to toggle it on and off ( ideal ) rather than the mouse? It'd
just be a bit more comfortable - can't see anything in the manual but I may
just have missed it.

Any ideas? Thanks in advance.
