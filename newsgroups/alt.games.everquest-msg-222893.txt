Man. If I were as ignorant about the USA as you are about Europe, we 
would make a great comedy duo.

I figured you would.

Sure. Shortly after Texas finally becomes independent.

If you need a gun to feel protected, then the problem is with you and 
the place you chose to live in. I consider myself fortunate I feel quite 
safe enough without one, and I'm under no delusion that I would be any 
safer if I did carry it. Most Europeans happen to agree with me, go 
figure.

Hmm. The Nazis exempted rifles from the existing (Weimar-era) permit 
requirements, and lowered the legal age for gun ownership from 20 to 18 
years. They were, in fact, pretty damn gun-friendly, and held similar 
views on self-sufficience and self-reliance as I hear from you. Besides, 
given the level of support for the regime throughout the war, more 
firearms would only have meant more dead Allies. 

> Umm... American Revolution?
> French Revolution?
> Russian Revolution?

Oh. How could I forget that all French and Russian peasants hid a gun 
under the pillow? I guess that made support for the Revolution within 
the army pretty unnecessary, huh?

> Yeah, and you STILL don't have a clue there Davey.

Well, you are the one who appears to be struggling with the rather 
simple concept of "we don't want your guns, you can keep them all, 
thanks".
