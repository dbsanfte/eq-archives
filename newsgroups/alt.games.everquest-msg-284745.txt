Another reason that occurs to me, though I've not seen this done so I don't
know if it'd work in practice - if the MA is a DPS provider rather than the
MT, he or she could decide to not target the mob until the MT has aggro and
is ready for DPS.  Target yourself until the MT tells you he's ready, then
target the mob and call for assist.

Anyone who doesn't know if they missed the call can then /assist RAID and if
they don't get a mob, they know they should be sitting on their hands.
