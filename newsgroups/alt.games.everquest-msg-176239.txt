You walked right up to the obvious and didn't even notice when it
whacked you on the nose.  Yes, they are bazaar mules.  The reason
they're in the same exact spot is that they never leave it.  A
character on another account (could be same player, or a friend, or
a guildmate, doesn't matter) walks up, loads goods to sell and/or
takes pp off.  Now, I'm not saying that in the particular case
you're referencing that those mules had sold out and been restocked,
they might well have had their prices too high, but you're mistaken
in your belief that just because they were standing in the same
place selling at the same price you can assume that they did not
sell their goods.

Even on Test, where the economy is terribly crippled, nobody sells
'ling silks for 5pp a stack.  The prices paid are not insane, and
your belief that they are shows a total lack of understanding of
how a market economy works.  The single irreduceable resource in-
game is the players' time.  If player A, a high level who can
bring in X pp per hour of play (while gaining xp!), wants to spend
his time pharming 'ling silks for no xp, instead of paying X/4 pp
(or X/2 even) for the amount of 'ling silk he could collect in that
hour, he's an idiot.  I don't see a whole lot of 61+ toons out
there collecting 'ling silk, do you?  I guess there aren't quite as
many idiots playing as I thought.  You are correct in saying that
prices are driven by the buyers.  It seems rather odd to me that
you stop there, blind to the fact that it is the buyers who have
driven prices up to the high levels they are at.

The people caught in the middle are the tradeskillers in the 40-55
crowd, who can't bring in the pp at the rate the high levels can.
They can either suck it up and pay the rates created by the high
level market, or go out and pharm the low level tradegoods instead
of xping.  Or, they can just focus on getting up to the high levels
where the stuff they want becomes more affordable.

Oh, and if you were to try selling 'ling silks at 1pp each in any
quantity at all it is very likely that you would be bought out by
another 'ling silk pharmer who would happily pocket the rather
large profit he could make off the difference between your low
price and the going market price.
