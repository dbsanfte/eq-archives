Hehe, suits me fine if the game need to be patched for 3 days, then 
europeans will have gotten the game too, so i can actually play.

Hehe, have already noticed several bugs:
Wolf form dont work. Didnt turn me into a wolf, dont know if rest of the 
party will be turned into wolves, or if you get the faction hits/raises 
from it without turning into a wolf.
Missing skelly animations, skellys in EC dont have animations to attack.
