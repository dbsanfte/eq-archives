Expectation? I have none.

Hope? That I have.

EQ1 became what it is because a small but vocal group powerleveled, 
powergamed, and powercomplained until EQ became all about the designers  
keeping up with them.

However they really aren't that many people. Several thousand or so, out 
of half a million.

Most of them have little interest in EQ2, because they've "invested" (as 
if what you call the time you spend in a video game an 'investment') so 
much in EQ1. If EQ2 does develop a group of similiar personalities, SOE 
can in theory say: "Play EQLive. We already made a game for you." 
instead of perverting EQ2 to cater to them too.

That said, I'm not thrilled with SOE, and plan to play WoW or something 
else once it reaches a certain point. Or sooner if I get bored with EQ.
