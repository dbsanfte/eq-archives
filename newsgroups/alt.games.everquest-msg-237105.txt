On 25 Feb 2004 19:16:55 -0800, I needed a Bable Fish to understand

Obviously you don't know many Pagans...  especially Solitary
Practitioners.  Many are very eclectic in their beliefs... gathering
various processes from other beliefs.  In essence the belief that
there is more than one way to commune with the devine force, and that
the only right way is the way that is Right for YOU.

True, but that is why it called an act of faith.... some are blind to
facts because they are so rooted in their faith.

There are many cosmology on how it all began... you are focusing on
the Bible...  Which as many know, has numerous contradictions.... many
attribute this to the fact it is a collection of stories that have
over time come together, and many of the stories are belived to be
Analogies, parables, or allegories....

Who said it was hard for the deity to prove the deity exists?  As
others have said, perchance they do not want to give solid evidence.
Then again, perchance, they do not exist at all..  Your working on the
assumption that the deity even cares if you know he exists.
