P.S.---
The original poster didn't say he was a brand new player only a couple weeks
into the game.  He said that starting about two weeks ago, his faction
reverted back to being unacceptable with the merchants....

The guy knows at least enough about the game to gain decent faction with the
Coalition of Tradesfolk with his Rogue.  Even a relative newbie with a
month's experience in the game usually can afford to buy a +3 ch cat's eye
necklace if a player-made one shows up at a merchant.
