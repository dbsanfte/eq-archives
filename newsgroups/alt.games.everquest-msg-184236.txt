A Twink is a Twink is a Twink.  If I want to give stuff to another
Char I am Twinking him or her if that Char is of Low level and could
not otherwise get the stuff.  Whether it is given, found laying on the
ground or handed down from on of you other Chars you are twinked.  If
I have something I would like to give away to someone who has nothing
I am still twinking that person.  If I'm giving something away and I
want to give it to someone who has nothing and you show up with a
bunch of stuff one I'm not going to give it to you because you are
TWINKED.  It is intended to help someone who doesn't have anything not
to make you even more TWINKED.  To me you are just being greedy and
are the type of person who would not give away things to other players
once you got to a higher level.  You would forget the joy you had when
you were given all that stuff and not try and pass the joy on to
others.  That is the reason most players give away things to others.
They are trying to instill this into new players.  I always tell
people that ask what they can do for me and I tell them to pass along
the favor to some other young player when they are able.

Now if you think this is wrong I hope you are on any server I play on.
