    I either twink so much, the levels fly by; or go to fast static camps,
and catch up on my reading; or immerse myself in some of the strategy of the
class in question, and try and learn how that class thinks.

    Or, you could be like the lamers on my server and go exploit one of the
worst pathing errors I've ever seen in Marus Seru and fly up in levels. I've
petitioned four people in two days since I first saw people using it, and
received a /praise on my account for explaining to a GM exactly how it
worked. Here's a warning to all you lameasses that think exploiting garbage
like that is OK: I will catch you, and I will petition you and get your ass
kicked.

    To give everyone some idea how bad this particular pathing is: there are
places one can stand in Marus Seru where pursuing mobs will freeze in place
when you stand on them, and not move until they enter flee mode. If you pull
a train, you can stand on these spots and blast away until the very last
mobs turns to run, and can even med up with mobs parked (and not
regenerating because they're in "chase" mode) until you can blast again.
There's no shades of grey here - anyone even remotely familiar with what an
exploit is knows that this is a doozy.
