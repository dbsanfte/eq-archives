The one you enjoy playing the most.  There is little point in having a level
65 character if you don't enjoy playing him.  I played my cleric from 1 to
52 in a matter of a few weeks because I was playing with some friends who
all decided to make alts together.  Since my two friends have pretty much
left the game, Sinrex has fallen by the wayside.  I will occationally take
him out for an LDoN adventure, but chances are he won't ever get to 60 or
beyond unless I find new people in the mid-50s I enjoy playing with.
Sinaiel, however, is a character I truely enjoy playing.  I could never
fathom leveling a character to 50+ if I didn't like playing him.  Sinratha
was enough of a chore to get to 46 and I'mm getting ee's out of him.

So basically find a class you like and that will be the one easiest to
level.  If you want some class suggestions, post what kind of role you would
like to have ingame.  Do you want to be able to solo easily?  Do you want to
be avidly sought out for groups?  Do you want to be able to slck
occationally?  Do you want to have something to be doing all the time in a
group?  I'm sure people here would be happy to offer some class suggestions
if you'd tell us what you are looking for beyond ease of leveling.

Sinaiel Soulmerchant -- Arch Lich
Sinrex Lightpurger -- 54 Vicar
Sinratha Martyr -- 46 Beastlord
all of Misericordia on Brell Serilis
