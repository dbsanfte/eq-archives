I've been seeing this on filesharing network, and wondered if it's
what it says it is ?  Can anyone confirm it's a downloader for the
beta ?

If so, do you need a key to get it ?

I'm trying to grab it, but nothing's happening.

If it is the downloader, could some kind sould email it to me ?

Thanks.
