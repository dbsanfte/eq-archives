I almost wish this thread hadn't caught me at the theological state it has.
I don't feel like I can be 4-square on one side or the other.  Every post I
make takes an inordinantly large amount of time to compose, as I have to
reconcile my own internal ledger.

Perhaps that's what's made it so interesting to me ... it's forced me to
think, rather than simply respond from a list of pre-programmed responses.

I can say this, though ... it's not been my intention to flame anyone for
their beliefs.  So long as their beliefs can be allowed to coexist with mine
(whatever they may be), everything's groovy.
