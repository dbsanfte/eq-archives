  I thought so too when I first read it.  But I think they just
mean that the info about the new feature, in this case, the
playable race froglok, is available today.

   I have a couple of thoughts for the new race, though I doubt I
will play it.  One, that it do backflips when casting a spell. 
Enchanters in illusion frog currently do this, so I have high
hopes about this.  The other.. wouldn't it be more realistic if
the frogs took damage overtime they stepped into a desert zone?

   If that were the case, though, it would only be fair if they
were to introduce the spell "moisten".
