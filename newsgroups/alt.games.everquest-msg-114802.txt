    See below - I need a clarification on part of this. But I am curious as
to who your clients were before this - I always thought things like Endless
Quiver were the real death of fletching. Did you mostly sell to twinks,
other rangers, who?

    I'm confused here. You say here that you cannot use the bow made with
Wood Elf Cultural fletching, yet you've also said that it put you out of
business. Did you only sell to wood elves, or are there a range of more
general products craftable with wood elf cultural that can be used by
non-wood elves?
