What server do you play on?

I would suggest getting all the expansion, but the most important will be
Planes of Power, the teleporters will make it much easier for you to get
around. Secondly Shadows of Luclin so you can visit the bazaar to buy cheap
newbie gear.

A good class to re-start with is a bard (Half-Elf) as you can solo very
easily and will be sought after in a group. :)

I hope this helps
