Yes, it was a pop, I was chain killing the entry mobs for faction repair while
waiting for some friends to show up so we could go in deeper for better faction
repair.  Not even a berserker, one of the regular plain vanilla mobs.  Dropped
torn silk gloves, I still have the darn things in inventory because I haven't
gotten a response from my few attempts to sell MQ, and none of my guildmates
want the things.

I expressed surprise and was told by guildmates that one had seen a similar
drop, leather sleeves, and another said he got plate gloves there once.  Now
this is 50 people, many of whom have doubtless killed thousands of pops there at
the entrance for the same reason I was: its not a lot of faction, but its
something to do while you wait.
