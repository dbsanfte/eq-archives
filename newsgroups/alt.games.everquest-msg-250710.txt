Yeah, I forgot about the hours of fun camping city gaurds for their 
generic 'Short Sword' & what nots, mostly because I never really cared 
to hose my faction(s) and skipped that whole deal.

Obviously. =) But in the original EQ that was a rather short lived 
length of time, especially as a quad kiting druid. Most people who 
played a lot got to 50 rapidly enough, and spent a long time there, 
sitting lists for rooms in LGuk and other camps, while they waited for 
what would prove to be Kunark.

To each their own. I cared, despite the truth about xp (while you still 
needed it)... if I wanted to play a MMOG by myself I'd have seriously 
wondered why I was playing a MMOG at all :).
