For multiple class "reserved items," it wasn't reserved until you were over
100DKP bid on it.  (Which was a pretty decent amount)

For single class items, it was still a problem that they never managed to
solve by rules. And it happened more often than you would think.   The monks
in particular were notorious for this type of behavior.  They would all bid
1 dkp on monk only items, then roll for it.  (All ties were solved by
random.)

It was not solved by the rules, so the players dealt with it themselves.
The other classes started doing the same thing out of self defense, and most
class only items went for very small sums, compared to the all / all items.

It sounds pretty bad, but it actually worked out ok.   The main problem with
this type of behavior is that people build up more points than they really
should have, so when an all / all item drops, the long timers will be able
to easily shove the price well out of reach of the new raiders.  But by the
same token, in order for the scheme to work, all of the new raiders were
getting shots at 'class only' items for thier class at 1dkp.  So the new
raiders were less likely to be able to buy all / all items than they should
have been, but they were more likely to be able to get thier class upgrades.

I believe Reconstructed on E'ci (the US time zone uberguild) uses a system
that would qualify as a queue system.  They list out all of the items they
want, then make lists of the lists, then have some complex formula for how
many DKP puts each person where in the queue.

Sorry I can't describe it better, but I was only told the general idea, not
the specifics of how it works, and I don't believe they have it posted in
areas that a non-member can get to.
