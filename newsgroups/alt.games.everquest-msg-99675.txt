The other day brought my level 16 troll travelled to LoIO. She decided that
this wasn't such a good idea after all and shouted that she was donating
35pp for an invis and a tp to gfay. A druid (She was not aware he was a
druid at the time) sent me a tell saying he'd do it. They meet up, he
teleports her to Butcherblock.

Argh.

Maybe BB isn't that far from GFay but she said what she wanted and wanted
what she said.

I should have done a /who [character name] (will from now on). I should also
be more aware of which races can be which classes. If I was more aware, I
would have known at a glance he was not a wizard.

Bringing my troll to LoIO

My troll was faction grinding in Blackburrow (Got some to con warmly and
some to con amiable.) She could not get much experience here anymore so she
decided she wanted to head to LoIO. She bought a teleport to the Feerot and
headed to Oasis to hop on the Barrel Barge. She took the boat to The
Overthere and was soulbound there. Walked thru the Overthere to the Frontier
Mountains. Afraid to stop and look around, she walked full circle around
Frontier Mountains, unable to find the entrance to Lake of Ill Omen. She
went back to the boat in The Overthere.

Once back in Timorous Deep, she tried to hop on the boat where it travels
goes between the ogre island and the bandit island. She missed, of course.
(When you're on the boat, it seems to move at a snails pace. When you're in
the water, however, it seems to haul ass.) She went to sleep while her
friend travelled the boat for some recon.

Stop FROM Firona Vie TO Timorous Deep
-2621, -2213
Stop FROM Firona Vie TO Elven Outpost
-4574, -2392
Stop FROM Butcher Block TO Firona Vie
(Where the boat stops for the shuttles)
4613, -6194

She awoke and swam to where the boat stops for the shuttles. She swam in
circles while waiting for the boat. Once the boat came, she hopped on the
cowcatcher, depressed that she had to ride third class. When the boat zoned
into Firiona Vie, she jumped off the boat and swam to the wall the entrance
to LOIO is on. (She also swam behind the wall where she could see the
tunnels from a side view.) She killed a couple of kitties, sat down by the
stream that leads to FV and was wasted by a lead explorer.

She made the trip back to FV, was walking along the wall to go back to LOIO
when a spider killed her.

Throughly frustrated, she did a /who cleric all to offer a cleric a donation
for a revive so she didn't have to make the trip... again. She saw a cleric
in FV and she sent him a tell explaining what happened, asked for a revive
and offered a donation. The cleric casted revivescence on her and rejected
her attempts to compensate him.

That's when she decided that hunting in LOiO was't such a good idea after
all and shouted that she was donating for a port to gfay.

The end
