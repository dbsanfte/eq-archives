I play a quite a variety of characters but these are the abilities I miss
most when I find I know longer have access to them:

- Snare type ability (whether snare, dooming darkness or consonant chain
type).
- Pet.
- Selos: Jboots and SoW seems so pokey no I have played a bard...
- Fear: especially when in combination with snare like ability.
- Charm. I have only realised the power of this on the bard but I
immediately started a chanter - it is awesome.
