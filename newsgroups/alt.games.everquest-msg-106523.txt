Eh?  Didn't understand that last part.

I'm not saying paladins are useless on raids, but we aren't exactly desired
either.  We take a back seat to warriors in xp groups, and don't solo very
well, either.  None the less, they're fun to play, so although I would like
them to beef us up, I can't really complain too loudly.

Wizards are one of those classes who can solo effectively and are nearly
essential on raids.
