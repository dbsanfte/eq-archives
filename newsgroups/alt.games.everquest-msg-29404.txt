Reinforced or studded armor are quite good if you can find a tailor. If your
character is a halfling, Small Scarab Breastplate in Kaladim is worth doing
for a 14 AC breastplate. You may have to do some faction work first.

You really shouldn't be getting hit all that much. You should keep SoW up
and Stinging Swarm on the mob, run until it is at least 1/2 dead. Maybe toss
in a snare to make sure it keeps its distance and just stay out of range,
hitting it with spells.

Any zone with high level animals and guards would be a good place to hunt.
At 16 you should be able to go to NK gypsy camp/guard tower and charm
Griffawns. When charm breaks, either get enough distance ahead to recharm or
just turn them over to the guards.
You should hunt a wisps for pp. You will still be getting experience from
them at 16.
