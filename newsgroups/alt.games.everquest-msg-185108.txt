I'm new to Everquest but very disappointed because I can't find
simple items that should be readily available from the merchants.
For instance, I needed cloth sandals for an armor quest but after
checking with probably every merchant in Qeynos, all I could find
were small cloth sandals even though Qeynos residents (humans)
do not wear small cloth sandals.  I got on a boat and ended up
in Butcherblock Mountains where, not surprisingly, they sell only small
cloth sandals for the little people there.  Finally, I went to Freeport
where I found the cloth sandals.

At the same time, I was looking for tiny daggers for my pet, but
had no success even in Freeport, so my enchanter character is
left practically defenseless.  I assume that either other casters had
already bought up the supply of tiny daggers or that the problem
is that I didn't check with the butcher, baker, candlestick maker, or
whomever.    It seems since the company created all these merchants
(many of whom look suspiciously identical), they want us to talk to all
of them as often as possible.

I think all the people I've met on Everquest have been extremely
friendly and helpful, but they can't make up for the shortcomings
of the game, so I think I will try another game even if it is affiliated
with a horrible OS.  On the positive side, there will be slightly less
competition now on Everquest for the available supply of tiny daggers.
