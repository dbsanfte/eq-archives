Jesus Christ, all I wanted to do was ask a simple question, I didn't expect
this to turn into a druid bashing session. Just as a matter of note, I DO
kite, and I have NEVER run any of my mobs over *anyone*. I got trained
enough when I was young that I know better than to do it to someone else.
And if I DO quad kite some day, you'd better believe I won't be doing it in
tight spaces, or dragging my mobs over other people. Bitch at the ones who
do it to you, not just any wandering druid, like me.

Thanks for playing.
