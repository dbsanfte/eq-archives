 Yeah, and it screws up non quad-kiters who were previously able to root
park stuff. Not only that but they upped the run speed on a lot of these
mobs so it makes splitting a little more painful. Nothing I can't work
around but it's sure annoying at times. I'd say making the mobs summon
would have been a better solution. Or maybe not since heal aggro in PoV
is a bit excessive. The cleric would be summoned every 15 seconds and
probably have heals interrupted. 

 So, while I'm glad they did something, I'm not exactly pleased with
what they did because it does make a fwe things harder on groups.
