Try Kael Arena. Two of our Guild druids will kite protectors in
circles around the open area while the rest of us take care of a mobs
individually. We use the same tactics in PoG. Spirit of Eagle lasts
much longer than SoW, and 3 points in Inate Run speed give them an
edge over the mobs if snare fails.

Sure we have an enchanter. The whole point is for the druid to get
agro and kite away from the main raid party, Some mobs are unmezzable.
If root sticks, great. If not then kite till we are ready for the mob.
It's called versatility and using your brain. Our guild leader even
kites Juggs around the small courtyard in Seb.

Damage shields are never useless. Are you high?

2 of MANY

Little tough on the shammies when you have 3-4 full groups, constant
pulls and the Shaman are slowing, debuffing, and buffing.

Damage is damage, and many raid mobs have FAST regen of HPs. DoT's
help negate this. It really helps with mobs that CHeal themselves.
Most raids involve high level trash that you have to clear before
taking on the boss mobs.

LOL! Tell that to the KSing Druids who nuke mobs when they are topped
off on mana in our raids. The whole point of debuffing is to make
nukes land for all caster classes. Not all raids depend on lures.

Wizards can't regen, snare/root kite, backup heal...Wizards also do
NOT get the sub-50 inter-zone evac.

Anyone who thinks they aren't post 50 sadly mistaken.

I have seen first hand Druids not only contributing but filling
essential roles durring our raids. Anyone who thinks Druids are
lacking post-50 doesn't know how to play the class effectively.

Several other classes? Shaman, Paladin...that's only 2.

I said best, not core. No class can touch the holy 3 (4 if you count
Shaman)
