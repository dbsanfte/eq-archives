>>SNIP some stuff<<

>>> and was told to go to Homicide Woods, erm, Lesser Faydark <<<

I like this, we always called LFay "Kith minor". (Kithikor Forest, where at
night there are mobs that can drop my lvl 50+ guildees in a heartbeat.) I
remember my first encounter with the brownie scouts: I was camping an orc
camp (orc camp in GFay, heavily camped, orc camp in LFay, never camped,
seemed a no brainer) getting some decent xp when I decide to return to BB.
While I'm running down the path, I get rooted. Look around, there's the
brownie. I think "OK, want to play that way", and fire an arrow at him. "You
have been struck for ungodly damage LOADING PLEASE WAIT....

>>> OK, I was getting most every tidbit of info from Everlore.com <<<

Try this link:

They have very good maps of every zone, including the cleric guild in
Felwithe. :)

Also, if you have been killing Orc Centurions, you may have seen a crushbone
belt or two. Collect these, and turn them in to the Warrior Guild in
Kaladim. At your level, this will be tremendous xp.
