If you find clerics boring to play, you are doing it wrong.

DOn't always group in situations where you =must= do
nothing but med and heal.  Look for variety, fights where
you are better suited to Nuking ( undead and a backup
healer in the group ) or Stunning (high caster population)
or Fearing (most outdoor zones) and can even do some
tanking.  Anything done repeatedly ad nauseum is a sure
ticket to boredom.

The situations where it is essential that you med every
second you aren't throwing a heal should be among the
most tense, most exciting in the game, as the life or death
of your entire party is in your hands.  Even here, you don't
merely sit... you watch the fight unfold, you follow relative
damage levels of the mobs and the tanks, and the mana
levels of the healers and casters.  Your job to call in
masssive nukage, or to ask for EVAC, as you are the
one most likely to know where the party as a whole stands
in the fight.  If you have the least to actually do, you
do have the most access to information and the best ability
to make leadership descisions.

Because your primary abilities, healing and buffing, are
cast on fellow party members, you can also group
effectively with people of significantly higher level than
yourself.  This puts you in encounters with much higher
level mobs than others at your level; with corresponding
increased excitement and loot levels.  You can do about
the same job as a healer that a druid or shaman of the
group's level might, but cost them a tenth the experience,
so everyone levels up faster... which tends to make
happy campers.
