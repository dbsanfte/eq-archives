Indeed, when I first got jumped by two of the crystal spiders, I hopped
down and ran to zone before turning to try them out.  When I ate them
for lunch without a proper spell loadout, I decided I'd been foolish.

But I'm quite sure there are loads of greenies out there now where that
wouldn't be the case, as whats green to me at 62 is a far cry from
green to 60.
