Please, very few wizards are aggro constrained in XP groups - they
are mana constrained.

I was in an xp group with a Conquest wizard a while back (our Time Guild)
and they were mana limited.

*I'M* aggro limited because I'm a mage - no de-aggro device, and the 
best mana regen in the game.

Even so, in a group with a Warrior MT I'm only losing about 1 black-steel
per fight due to aggro concerns.  Swap in a paladin/sk and I bet I would
be time constrained (IE - chain nuking and no possible way to dish faster).
