Why zone?  Move far enough out that you lose aggro.

However, both these methods apply only to "things went
badly wrong," you aren't supposed to be getting adds
at all.  If you are playing a solo mage and getting adds,
you are doing so incorrectly.  As a cleric, I solo, and
again, I don't want adds.  I do have the means to deal
with them, but 99% of the time I don't have to, because
I don't pull them in the first place, and I fight where
there are no roamers; adds are a waste of mana and
worthwhile killing for me consists of near total use of
my mana bar (I like medding afk, you see)

I did play a mage to 28, soloed a good deal of that.
There are certainly better solo classes out there, but
then again that was back before the pet changes,
so I still had to blow significant amounts of mana
in to a fight to not lose half the exp.  Since the changes,
I'd want to balance out pet regen and my mana regen
so pet is Full Health when I'm Full Mana, without concern
for whether I'd done more damage than it did... seems
to me a far handier plan.  Mage pets also got beefed up
in terms of damage output, I hear (certainly the elementals
in the Hole got meaner at that point!)
