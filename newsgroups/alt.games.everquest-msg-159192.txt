Well after going there myself and getting some xp, my early post was
inaccurate and like I said based on second hand info which I should know
not to trust by now.  Still, the xp is really good per kill, and yeah
its gonna be nerfed one way or another.

I agree the stuff is hard, but its real doable and the XP flys by there.
Verant is not going to stand for it if their past actions are any
indicator.  Maybe they wont nerf the xp awards, but I am sure they will
start to either a) make most of it summon and/or b) make most of it
immune to changes in run speed.  Any thing they change is a change that
could have been avoided with better QA and testing(or even any
testing...), just like always.
