With the release of the Prophecy of Ro, there is yet another top-end single
group set of warrior armour to be considered.

In Arcstone, there is a quest commonly referred to as the Spirit Forged
Armour quest. Here's the link ->
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3375

The Warrior Armour is called something of the Blessed Champion. Please
remember, the Raex's armour is for comparison only, if it was an upgrade it
probably isn't one-groupable, additionally some parts of the Armsmaster's
armour are not one-groupable (notably chest and legs) if they're upgrades.

Totals are as follows,

                            AC     HP      Minimum Required Level
First Order                 347    910     70
Grandmaster's Stormguard    452    1040    65
Armsmaster's                395    975     60
Raex's                      492    1335    65
Blessed Champion            442    1160    68


With DoN type 9/12 augs,

                            AC    HP      Minimum Required Level
First Order                 347   1200    70
Grandmaster's Stormguard    452   1330    70
Armsmaster's                395   975     60
Raex's                      492   1335    65
Blessed Champion            442   1160    68


Here's the breakdown per slot,

              Slot               chest legs wrist head hands feet arms
Armour set
First Order                ac    72    51   32    41   39    39   41
                           hp    125   125  115   110  105   110  105

Grandmaster's Stormguard   ac    99    81   32    59   45    45   59
                           hp    145   145  115   135  135   115  135

Armsmaster's               ac    78    57   38    47   45    45   47
                           hp    140   130  115   120  120   115  120

Blessed Champion           ac    87    63   42    54   50    50   54
                           hp    160   150  135   140  140   135  140


I think it's clear that the Blessed Champion armour outclasses the OoW
Armsmaster's armour in every slot so far, it easily outclasses the DoN
crystal bought First Order armour, and it is on a par with the Grandmaster
gear. It tends to have lower AC than the GM armour but more HP. However,
the foot slot is clearly an exception, with the new Blessed Champion armour
outclassing even the DoN GM Armour in that position. The gloves, at 40%
haste are an incredibly useful item to own.

Based on how easy the armour is to get (I'm not sure yet, having never
tried), it's possible that the Blessed Champion armour is the best risk vs
reward, single group armour in the game, at present. The only major
drawback is the required level (68).

In terms of additional features, the armour is also well represented, it
has shielding, and various focus effects such as combat effects, improved
parry and improved dodge, not forgetting the hard to beat 40% haste.

In short, go get the Blessed Champion armour, it's excellent value.
