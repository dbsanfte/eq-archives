Yup.

Sometimes I think it simply doesn't occur to sellers to check vendors.  For
example, Green Silken Drapes often go in the Bazaar on my server for around
15-20 plat (numbers from memory...may be off on everything, but the ordering
is right).  If you look at the stats on them, and compare to other robes,
that is a reasonable price.

However, vendors will buy them for 23 plat.

There are probably a lot of items like this, but there isn't a good way to
discover them.
