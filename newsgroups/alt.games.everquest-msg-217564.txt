When eq first came out there was this plan that if you wanted pvp (able to
kill other players) you could talk to the priest and switch it on.  Your
name would turn red and you would be perma pvp.  You could only kill other
reds, and no blue (non-pvp) player could help you with any buff or port.  It
turned out that there was *never* enough people that chose pvp to make it
worthwhile.  The coding is still in but without anyone to kill there is no
reason to choose it except for vendors who like red names.  There are
servers now specifically for pvp.  I'm not quite understanding why there are
enough people that like pvp to fill up a red server but yet they never chose
the red life on regular servers.  Perhaps living amongst bluenames was
somehow offensive to them.
