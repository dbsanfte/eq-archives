It's been like that since the begginning i believe, they think you get "more
involved, or immersed" in the game if you cannot go out to windows to surf
the web or read mail and such *shrug*.
Also they are deadly afraid the people may come up with programs that hack
the server while playing so they don't give you a chance to tab out to
windows, and do bad stuff anf then tab back in to EQ and take advantage of
what you just hacked.. I guess they never heard of such a thing as people
actually owning several computers.. *bigger shrug*.

Reason: protection from frivolous litigation. there are people who would try
to sue for ANYTHING. In fact I think I will throw myself out my second story
window, break a few bones and sue the company who built this house for
placing the second story so high off the ground..
