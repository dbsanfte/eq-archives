Your "double attack" skill is the chance to take an extra swing.  Even when
you max out your skill, there will still be a failure rate for this skill,
meaning that you will never actually get to twice as many attacks in the
long run.  Early on, your failure rate will be so high that you will hardly
notice any more swinging going on at all.  In the long run, its definately a
worthwhile skill to have...but don't go to any special trouble to raise it,
as five or ten points worth of difference won't even register, its one of
those skills that starts to matter up over 40th level.
