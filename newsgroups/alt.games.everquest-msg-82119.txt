Bzzt.  Wrong, but thanks for playing.  There's nothing that says
that they couldn't be human beings with the right technology,
particularly germ and stem cells.

The fact is that we *know* they contain all the necessary 
ingredients to become humans.  The only thing we don't know
right now is how to turn on the right switches.  That will
come.

Your game falls apart quickly with your definition of human.
Let's try this thought experiment -- which *is* quite doable
with *today's* (actually, yesterday's) technology.

1) Take an embryo at the two cell stage.  You claim this is
a real honest-to-God "human." 

2) Now, separate the two cells.  You can do this, and if
kept separated, the two cells will grow to from two separate 
embryos.

So, sanjian, where did that second "human" come from?  Or
do you claim that *every cell* in an embryo is a separate
human?  Or, is it that the second embryo is *not* human?
Which one isn't the human -- the one on the right or the
one on the left (I choose left, but then I'm a Republican).

Let's take the fundamentalist approach and say that a second
"human" magically appeared the moment I separated the two cells.
Ping!  Another human!

If I discard one of these cells, that's OK, the remaining cell
will continue to form a complete human being.

If I kill that second cell, did I commit "murder" of that
"developing human?"  How could I?  The conceptus it came
from will never notice the difference?

But wait!!! There's more !!!!

3) I *don't* discard the second cell.  I change my mind and
call off the whole thing.

Now I *rejoin* the two cells.  They will now grow into
one embryo instead of two.  What happened to that second
"human?"  Did I "kill" it -- even though I didn't even 
"kill" a single cell, but merely separated and rejoined
two cells?  Oh no!  Homunculus interruptus!  

How could I have "murdered" a "human" without killing
anything?  If it was a separate "human" how could it
be anything else?
