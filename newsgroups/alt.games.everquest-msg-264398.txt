Right now the way it works is mixed. With some skills you just get them 
automatically increased when you mini-ding. At the end of a yellow bar you 
suddenly increase all your skill levels by a point, so by the time you to 
your next level they are already maxed.

No idea if this is the intended design or a placeholder. But I'm with you 
guys on this one, I want to see it change to reflect usage, not arbitrary 
level.
