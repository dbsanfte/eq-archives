93% experience recovery, and it's a level 53 spell. The problem is, it
needs a component, which is an essence emerald. You get it by the
level 51 Spell sacrifice. You need an emerald and ... somebody has
to die. Yes, you cast sacrifice on one of your friends and he dies,
then you get the essence emeral to ressurect somebody else.

Under normal conditions nobody does that .. but if everybody,
especially the cleric, is dead .. one might onsider this.
