You sure you're on the same server as me? =)

The dark team is outnumbered at least 2 to 1 by the so-called 'light team'
probably closer to 3 or even 4 to one.

That old excuse the 'light team' uses for crossteaming is no longer valid,

Oasis was pure dark team all the time.

Mainly because EC is a warzone between the pecks, the Freeport humans, the
Faydwerians that just came off the boat, and the dark team.
