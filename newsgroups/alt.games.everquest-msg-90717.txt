Lemme see... 
If I died in a raid, I better make sure that I stay as long as it takes 
to recover all corpses, or I don't get my shit back. Sorry, ma, will go 
to your funeral some other time.
If I'm a tank, I better make sure I have someone get my corpse for me, 
since it's about impossible for me to do so myself.
In other words, nothing wrong with it
