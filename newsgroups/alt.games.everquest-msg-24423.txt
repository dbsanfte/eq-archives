To be able to do them quests it would require me to not be KoS, just killing
Halfees doesn't work.
I have done some investigating and apparently I gain faction if I kill the
elves in Timorous deep, there's food for thought...need to put up my
swimming anyway.

It's my DE warrior that needs Halfling faction, basically so as to ensure I
don't get attacked if I ever have to port in there.
