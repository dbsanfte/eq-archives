I remember i was grouped with a Ogre tank in HPK once. He accidently fell
asleep (I know he did, since he didnt respond to anything for about 20 mins,
and that he said that he was falling asleep at his keyboard). Well, suddenly
everything popped and we where wailing and screaming, but he did not budge.
We got the pops killed and i finally EVACed him to the HPK "safespot" which
really isnt safe due to the trains, and the wimpy guards. I hope he made it
tho.
