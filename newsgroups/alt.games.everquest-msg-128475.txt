Here's a thought...

It seems to me that pet names differ according to level, class and type
(Fire pets have different names to Air/Earth/Water, etc).

You can't get 2 pets with the same name in the same zone (at least I've
never seen it happen)... and I'm guessing the names aren't random, otherwise
it'd take forever to summon one if the randome-name-generator kept picking a
name already in use...

Is there a set list of pet names pre-generated for each zone? If so, is it
possible that pet stats are also pre-generated for each name?
