Playing my 52 paladin lately has been mostly identical (down to the
"dang RL").

Nah.  It's a post-45 with a "regular" job and young children thing.
When I'm on for an extended period of time I usually have to avoid
grouping because of frequent and unpredictable AFK requirements.  I have
grouped occassionally with guild-mates under these circumstances, but I
always feel like I'm imposing on them because I'm not 100% there, so I
mostly avoid grouping anytime the kids are home and not sleeping.  And,
of course, there's only so much time between when the rugrats are all
safely into their cages, er, beds, and when I have got to get some
sleep myself.

If your desire for the "rewards" of the post-50 game isn't strong enough
to get you to wreck your home-life, then yes, it sure does get boring.
Like you, I play alts more than my main now.  The high-level game just
doesn't suit my life.  I'll probably never find out whether I'd enjoy it
or not, the game'll no doubt be history before I'm in a position to
dedicate that sort of time to it.

I may not be sane, but at least I'm well-adjusted enough that my mother
won't ever be suing Sony because EQ "made" me commit suicide.
