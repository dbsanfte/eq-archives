I suppose you are correct there. I should qualify that I was not
including the situations where ping-ponging, for instance, is in fact
called for - even necessary. There are exceptions to every rule, and
I'm sure that as I level up I will come to know more of them. My
comments strictly apply to the times when it is desirable for the MA
to maintain aggro.

Yes, of course.

All good and valid points - just a little outside of my intended
point.
