Just got mine last night too. As a 24 shaman, I am finding my best use is to
root mob, back up, dot and dd, then apply darkness at about 30% and am all
set if root breaks before they die. I did this on FV server, so had to solo
the Pally. I got a kei and a temperance, and was able to burn him down with
dot and dd, even though he was red to me. Also I didn't kill woompal before
he went green to me, so his head wouldn't drop(trivial loot code it tough
for quests). Had to resort to getting a druid to wolf form me to get the
note from the mob in West Commons. All in all, a fun quest, and a great item
I'm sure I will use a lot.

Yeen, 25 Troll Shaman, FV
