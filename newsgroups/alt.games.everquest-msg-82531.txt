     All _what_ people?  Do you really know of 
anyone in the game that does this?  I report
offensive names.  I report very stupid ones.
But only if they actively annoy me.  I have
nothing hotkeyed, and I doubt that others do
either.  But yes, if I see "Poopfinger" or
"Bashyourheadin" you bet I'm going to report 
it.  Most people that I've encountered who
say they report names are pretty much the 
same...they don't go searching for people
to turn on on slight infractions.  They
just finally get fed up by seeing "Licmypuss"
run past them in EC for the third time that
day.
   So C'mon...how many people do you know
that really play EQ with their noses buried
in a English-Swahili dictionary looking for
dirty names?
