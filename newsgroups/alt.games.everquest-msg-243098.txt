That would be rather dumb of them, since most people would would leave EQ
over poor server operations would be reluctant to consider another Sony
game.

It would be even more dumb to do it for a game that is not out yet, since
between the time those people leave EQ and can start EQ2, they might try
DAoC or Horizons or Final Fantasy XI and lose interest in EQ2.  Also, the
Wow beta should be in later stages by the time EQ2 comes out, so large
numbers of people will be playing that for free.
