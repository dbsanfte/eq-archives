Hmmmmmm.... I'll try to remember to experiment with this tonight. Unless
it's changed though, at least on the blue servers, used to be you
couldn't heal or cast beneficial spells on somebody who was dueling
unless they were in a PvP (arena) area.  Or so my befuddled brain
recalls it. Then again, it's been a while and I've been known to be
wrong before.

I believe the last time was in 1977.
