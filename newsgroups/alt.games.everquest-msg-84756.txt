Ok, I know I'm setting myself up as devils advocate here, but what is
wrong with asking this question?  Sure, if you misunderstand the
question and read some sort of racism into it you can turn it into
something bad, but in its intended form, a question asking "why?" not a
statement saying "you can't do that!", just what is wrong with her
wanting to get some input from others on the subject?  She saw
something, she wondered about it and decided to ask for help in
understanding.  Most everyone who responded did so as though she had
done something wrong in asking about something she wanted to understand
rather than simply explain the numerous reasons why.  Pretty sad when
folks would use opposition to hate as an excuse to hate, especially when
you consider the lack of malice in  her original intent.
