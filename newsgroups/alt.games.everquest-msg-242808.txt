My cleric is poor also.  What I have done is say upfront, "I am a poor
cleric, I don't have enough plat for the spell component for temperance, but
I can cast Resolution and Armor of Faith"  You would be surprised to find
that many melee types carry their own periodots and will give one to you in
order to have temperance cast on them.
