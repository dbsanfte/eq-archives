This is flawed.   The mana efficiency on C Heal is much better than
you describe.  It is often a more efficient spell when the tank
reaches the 2500-3000 hp range.

As an example, at L50 my cleric still has Superior Heal memmed for
Spot Heals, It will heal 612 hp (no IH2 focus item at the moment) for
250 mana,225 with Mana Reduction II, maybe a bit better if the
Specialization roll kicks in.

C Heal will heal up to 7500, for a cost of only 400.  Additionally,
due to recast time, etc, even with Spell Haste, I can only just get 2
Superior Heals off in the time it takes for a CHeal.  So for anything
over say 1200 HP (rough figures here...not busting out a calculator),
the C Heal is a more viable option.

That means if the tank has 2500 hp, the C Heal at 50% is largely a
better deal.  As the hp of the target rises, that efficiency improves.
