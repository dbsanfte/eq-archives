You have to pay for the actual game, but, when you do, you get one month to 
play free, if you cancel before the month is up, you will not be charged 
for playtime.  There was an offer for one or two weeks of free play along 
with a download of just the classic (original, no expansions) game, don't 
know if there is still anything like that floating around.  You can usually 
pick up the original game for around $10, so, that's all your first month 
would cost you.  You will be able to try it on just about any of the 
servers.
