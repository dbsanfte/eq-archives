Not even close. They bundled the bonus disc with the wrong movie. If it 
was bundled with X2 there would be no complaint... budling it with the 
power rangers is where the issue comes in.

No problem at all if you happen to reliably win the lottery.

It is.

Most 'free with purchase' promos, are available separately for a price. 
EQ2 beta slots aren't. Naturally if this is the case the promo doesn't 
bug me.

Of the 'free with purchase' promos that are not available separately, 
most are attached to a relevant product, which is also fine by me. By X2 
to get the X2 bonus disc doesn't bug me.

Only when the free with purchase promo, is *only* available by buying a 
different product when that different product is entirely unrelated and 
undesirable do I have an issue. (e.g. x2 bonus disc with might morphin 
power rangers)
