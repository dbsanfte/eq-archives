Hell, I'd be ecstatic if they simply took steps to ensure
that there was a minimum of *one* GM on duty at all times
across the entire server pool (especially in the middle of the night).

Even a guaranteed *Guide* presence would be a major step up.

As it stands now, if it's anywhere between about 10pm and 10am, odds
are your emergency petition will accomplish absolutely nothing.

I've got nothing against them ignoring "so-and-so trained me"
type petitions when they're shortstaffed, but there are
time-critical petitions that will majorly inconvenience
a player (or his whole group/guild) if they can't be addressed
until "tomorrow -- maybe".

For as much money as SOE is raking in on this game (and yes,
I understand they have large overheads as well), it would be a
trivial change in their revenue stream to pay a GM to take
the "graveyard shift".

And shouldn't a game open 24-hours a day have at least a
minimal amount of 24-hour customer service?
