If your lag-o-meter(tm) displays "0 - 0.0% 0.0% - 1000" then you are
suffering severe lag.
the first 0 (on the left) is your ping to server, it is not actually zero
but for some reason EQ won't display the actual figure....I have never seen
anything over 1100 (although people have told me that they have had figures
far above that) and in my experience when it goes above 1100 it seems to set
itself to 0. At that point the game is, more or less, unplayable as you have
seen.
Try connecting to another server that is hosted elsewhere (AB or one of the
other Euro servers) and see how they work, if there is improvement then
there is likey an outside problem and nothing to do with patch. You could
use tracert to find where your connection suffers.
