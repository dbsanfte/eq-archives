At 52, buffed with the non self only buffs, my shaman is at 250 STR, magelo
does not appear to be accessible at the moment, so I am uncertain what his
STR is without the Harness and Strength buffs.  According to castersrealm,
these two spells give about 134 points of STR.  With self only buff thrown
in, I can get to 255 easily, but that is self only.  Still, 134 points of
added STR is significant enough in increased damage output to be well worth
it.
