I agree, it will not do any harm to the system to try this, but in my 
experience, you will never get a completely stable system by going this route. 
Your telling words are "It may work just enough". If the goal is a fast, 
stable system, then a fresh install of Windows is the only way to proceed.

When it is up and running, the new HD could be jumpered as the primary and the 
old HD could be jumpered as the salve, then popped into the new system with EQ 
ready for action, so to speak :-)

This is the person's first build attempt, so in my opinion and I stress it's 
only my opinion, to saddle them with inconsistencies of an OS installed for an 
older system is not worth risking. IF the CPU's were from the same 
manufacturer, IF the chipsets were from the same manufacturer, if the audio 
chipsets were etc., etc., then a simple swap "might" work, but no guarantees.
