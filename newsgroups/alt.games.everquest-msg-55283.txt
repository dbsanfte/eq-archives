While skinning lions, bears, wolves, etc. in NK, I heard a "What is Zahal 
the Vile?"  I was pretty sure this guy had something to do with the Cleric 
Sol Ro. armor quest, so I asked for the Loc and ran there to see a Ranger 
( guy who shouted ) fighting him.  I asked him why he was fighting him, and 
he said that he got aggroed by him.  Since I knew he wasn't fighting him 
for the cleric stuff, I waited until he died and asked what he dropped.  He 
said it was a bag of Troll Guts.  Hrm.  Didn't sound right.

*BONG*  I then remembered this spawned some guy way up north, so I trotted 
up there, expecting a big fight, and finally found the guy ( Regis ) and 
killed him, although he did some good damage to me.  I looted the flute and 
the ingot (?) for the quest.

Can my chanter do this quest for my cleric or will the Sol Ro person not 
let me do it?  If I can't do it, I plan to Multi it.  Will this work?  Even 
if I can do it, I may Multi it for the EXP for my 9th level Cleric, anyway.
