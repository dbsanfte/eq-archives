Great! Turning in Stanos' head to a spawned/charmed General
DOES de-poof the General in exchange for the mask, however
I wouldn't even attempt it unless the rogue(s) for their pouches
were (1) done, and (2) still had one Inky left up in the cabin.

I already have my box to spawn the General on my own, and
just need a raid that wouldn't mind me popping in before they
kill the last house spawn...there's no need to even fight anything
in order to get the mask (unless General resists charm....;-)  )
