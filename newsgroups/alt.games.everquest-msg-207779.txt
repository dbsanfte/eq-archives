Sony is very good about not charging you until after the first 30 days. 
They are a reputable company with thousands of subscribers, I've never 
heard of them having problems with lost info or anything like that.
If you are concerned about them charging you do the following:  after 
you give them all you credit card details, go in the game once to make 
sure the account is started.  Then, log out, click account, then end 
billing and then log in, you'll get a popup asking for confirm and your 
password again.  This way, at the end of the first month, you'll have to 
resupply CC info or else stop playing.  If you don't want to use a CC, 
there's always prepaid game cards.
