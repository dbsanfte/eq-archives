Rule number one: You don't make money on tradeskills, you make money
off of the other suckers working on tradeskills by selling them
components. At 30th lvl, you can easily make money by farming spider
silks and quality pelts for leather padding.

Trust me, those higher level shaman aren't there to try and make money
off of buffing people. But nobody pays much for 30th lvl shaman buffs
so it's a loosing proposition. You might be able to sell sow potions
for a profit though, depending on what the market is like on your
server.

Get used to it, that isn't gonna change for quite a while. Sorry if
that sounds harsh but too many people will twink their lower level
characters for it to be any other way. No big deal though, the quality
of a shaman isn't measured by his equipment so just ignore them and if
they taunt you about your gear, write em off as jerks.

Yup, that's basically the way it works. Pretty much everyone's main
was broke on the way to 60+, and some of us are still broke even once
we get there <g>. 

If you're a barbarian, everfrost is a nice spot at 30th lvl. The big
mammoths are still blue to you and they drop tusks worth 9.5p each.
Plus there's a convenient vendor close to sell to. Takes a while to
figure out where they spawn if you don't have tracking but at least 2
of them are instant repops so there will always be 2 up. The newbie
part of everfrost is also a great spot to farm trade skill components.


The Gnoll spires in SK are also good money and probably uncamped these
days. Gnolls drop FS weapons that sell for a few plat as well as
decent cash. 

You're probably high enough level to solo the orcs just inside the
zone line in Crystal Caverns. They tend to have pretty decent drops
and acylia probably still sells well to trade skillers.
