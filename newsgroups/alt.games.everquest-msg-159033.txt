Of course...

Mem as needed, it lasts long enough that it shouldn't use a permanent slot.

> 3. Bravery

Normally I'd treat it the same as Gugard, i.e. mem as needed. However, this
line of spells do heal very efficiently, so I'd hold onto it as a backup
heal unless you're grouped with a druid (since this line won't usually
overwrite the Skin line.)

> 4. Symbol of Ryltan

Another "as needed".

> 5. Stun

Generally don't mem this unless I'm up against spell casters. Root is more
useful for escape purposes; stuns just don't last long enough to give you a
useful lead.

> 6. Instill

I generally have Root up instead, as it casts more quickly, is cheaper, and
sticks more reliably if the MOB is attacked.

> 7. Divine Aura

Always handy - I frequently keep the second Divine memmed as well. Solo it's
useful for escape, when grouped it gives the tanks more of a chance to aggro
the tank if you're being attacked.

I usually have gate memmed too, but another strategy I've seen is to use
this slot for Divine Barrier, and if you need to escape use a Divine and use
the time to mem Gate.

My own 30 lineup was basically:
1. GHeal
2. Heal (useful for healing casters)
3. Divine Aura
4. Divine Barrier
5. Root
6. Swap slot for buffs, Summon food/drink etc, or Dismiss Undead
7. Wrath
8. Gate
Skin buffs were common enough that using Bravery as a heal wasn't really
practical.

My 37 lineup is similar, but with Atone or Heal in 6, GHeal in 2 and SHeal
in 1. When grouping, Wrath gets swapped out for a stun or buff...

I'm trying to figure out what to do at 39... obviously CHeal will be at 1
and probably SHeal at 2... the rest of the 39 line look like swapin
material.
