Actually, I believe this is what I have too; it's the disk that came
with November's CGW magazine. 
There's a trial period on the temporary account, but then you can sign
up for an account and begin play on the regular servers without
needing any further software. In fact, the characters created on the
test server are ported over to a new server of your choice once you
set up your account, so you don't have to redo levels.
