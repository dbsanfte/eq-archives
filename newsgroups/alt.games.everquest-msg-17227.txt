We have a shammy in our guild in his forties who apparently still does
*some* soloing, but proclaims that soloing sucks at those levels as for
anyone except a druid or necro.  As to desirability? *Very*.  The slows
in battle, combined with the uberbuffs, are very desired in group
combat. Also, it seems the higher you go, you simply can NOT always
count on getting a cleric, and the Shammy doesn't make a bad healer in a
pinch. Constant sow supply is nice too. But mostly I think it's the
slows, buffs, and debuffs that will make the shaman be welcomed with
open arms in higher level groups.
