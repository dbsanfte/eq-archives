+resist was a bit of an exaggeration. But I'd but DC on par or better 
than another 2% avoidance on the average druid. Considering I was also 
primarily considering a level 59 druid who does stuff other than raid. 

I agree at level 69 in a raid guild you might NEVER use DC on a raid, 
and only occasionally if you happen to be farming tradeskill drops or 
something. Of course, you probably don't tank much either so the 2% 
avoidance probably isn't going to come into play much either. 

At any rate given this was *another* DC vs MGB post I presumed that the 
druid was probably 59 and not under heavy pressure to get MGB from his 
guild... (else he wouldn't be asking).

Which makes DC likely to be both fun and useful, for a while at least.
