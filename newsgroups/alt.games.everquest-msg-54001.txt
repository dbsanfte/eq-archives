Subject: Raising skill in weapons...

My ranger is a master at 1 HS.  I've been dual wielding a wurmslayer and a PGT.
 I thought I would put a 1 HB in my offhand to raise my level at it.  Can I
raise 1 HB if the weapon is in my off hand?  If not, can I raise my skill at it
in the primary slot killing green mobs that don't give me experience?
Thanks!!!!
