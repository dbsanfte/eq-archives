I used to do this a -lot- as a cleric melee strategy (taught to me
by a druid who called it  the Bunny hop)

Get a big slow weapon, hit attack and then sit.  Watch the attack
button, when it cycles back up, stand, attack, sit down.  Your
weapon stays greyed out for the same amount of time no matter what
you are doing.

There is no visible Attack button for the offhand weapon, so you
can't get this information from looking, but the same thing must be
happening.  When you switch to a new target with your primary,
if its still cycling (and greyed out) then it won't attack till its done.
That same effect must be happening with the secondary.

Now if its been a while since you last fought, then both weapons
should hit at the same time regardless of what their relative
delays are, just as a delay 20 weapon hits immediately when
you swing it primary, and a delay 50 weapon hits immediately
when you swing it primary.  If you are dual weilding, it would
still be sheer luck of the draw which actually processes thru
first to swing, although assuming you make the check both
really hit at the same time within a split second.

PS The bunny hop allows mana regen and melee damage
output to occur concurrently, in case you wondered why
anyone would do such a crazy thing
