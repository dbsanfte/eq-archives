	But I can't choose what to believe.  I can't believe two plus two equals
five, or three, or whatever the Party says it equals today.  My beliefs are
chosen for me by the evidence around me.  If the universe is god's work then
god has already specified what my beleifs will be.

	This leads to a conundrum I've posed often in the past, and never really
gotten a satisfactory answer to.  I am purportedly a creation of god.  Given
the abilities of the god we are being asked to believe in, he must have known
in the very instant that he even conceived the idea of Dennis Francis
Heffernan what qualities I would possess and what decisions I would make -- my
essence would precede my existence.  He must have known that I would be an
atheist before I was actually brought into existence.  He chose to create me
anyway.  According to some Christians, then, I will be burned in fire
*forever* for *being what I was created to be*, and I *deserve* this fate.

|Nope we dont... man knows everything...  

	I did not say that.  I said we don't need gods to explain thing any more.

|except the Unknown... that is
|where the faith and belief systems come in.

	That's exactly where they should go out.

	"I don't know yet" is a far, far better answer than "god did it".
