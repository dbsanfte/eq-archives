I just bought a new Pentium 4 (1.6 gigahertz with 768 megs of RAM) and
the factory installed video card.  Does anyone have any video card
upgrade suggestions?  I don't do any video editing and the only real
use of heavy duty graphics processing is by games (mostly EQ, but some
first person shooter and sims).  I'd like to keep it under $100, or
$150 if it is worth the extra $50 for some reason.
