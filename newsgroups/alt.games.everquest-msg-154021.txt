Everquest issue: Crashing to Desktop right after getting into game.

Just thought Id share an issue I had and what I did to resolve it.

Ok there were NO changes done to my machine (no new installs, no new
drivers, no new EQ patches) and EQ was working great.  next day I log
in no issues all the way past Character selection.  Right as I come
into the world Im able to see all my Screen Layout etc, and Bam... to
desktop.
I think "weird"  so do it again...except with a different character
(who uses a different UI and is in a different zone) same thing.   hmm
 I attempted to change my NEWUI to the Default Via the ini file.
Still same thing.  Ok I turn off the new UI in the ini,  I am able to
get into game but GOD I hate the old UI now.  
Ok , so while in game I delete my characters NewUI ini file andin game
I turn on the NewUI.   Bam same thing crash to desktop.

Then I remember someone mentioning deleting all the temp files  I
belive they end in txc or tcx.     
WHOOT into game now... no issues..  

Suggestion:  If your having EQ issues... Delete the temp cache files.


Good luck to you
