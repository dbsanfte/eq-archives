Agree.  I hated UO.  I think SWG will suck for all the same reasons
(PKing, no levels).  It will also suck because you won't be able to have
a ship unless you buy an expansion.  Hello!!!!  SW is half space
combat!  It will suck because you won't be able to play a robot.

It also sounds like they will be stealing ALOT from Anarchy Online. 
Some good, some bad. 

Even though I think it will suck big donkey dong, I have a glimmer of
hope, and I'm just going to have to try it.

Agree on Ebayers.

If anyone has a chance it's those of us who play Bards & Enchanters in
EQ.  I want mind powers!
