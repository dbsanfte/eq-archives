That's it, I am sick and tired of being screwed over as a cleric.

I am going to create a petition for verant to update the cleric spell /
ability list:

- SoW come on, how many times have you had to run through 2 or 3 zones to
res someone, we clearly need this.
- DOT spells, it would be nice if we could cast at least one of these while
we are sitting waiting to heal
- Dodge maxed at 75? that is a farce as well as not getting dual wield or
kick.  I was forced to stop soloing all but undead at lvl 30 and being a
social intravert this was unacceptable.
- Mez, if we can get dual wield or kick to help us fight, at least give us a
mez so we don't have to live with the getto mez version.
- Clarity, well it would be nice too although I don't want to get greedy.

Yes my brothers and sisters, I will post this on the verant home boards come
and show your support to at least make cleric an equal in Norrath.
