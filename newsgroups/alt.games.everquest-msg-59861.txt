From a storyline PoV (and I know you're not all that concerned with the
storyline, but bear with me), I can see why the Iksar would be a little
iffy.

Mainly because they LOST SEBILIS because of outsiders.  As far as they're
concerned, Kunark is theirs, and you guys are invaders bringing false
religion and philosophy into their land, threatening to make their new home
another Sebilis. . .

Poor lizards.
