I'm every bit as casual as you are, and I don't feel the expansions take 
anything away from me (besides cash and play time during the patches, 
obviously). I haven't got much use of LoY, and basically nil off LDoN, 
but that's entirely down to my play style. Read the releases, inform 
yourself, and if an expansion doesn't sound like it will add 
considerably to your EQ experience, vote with your money.

As far as I'm concerned, they can keep'em coming...
