Well, the Rangers and Monks would certainly bitch about it, probably
even more than Paladins are bitching about the BattleCleric(tm), but
it wouldn't change the game as much as you might expect.  First, all
of the Knight-only (one, the other, or both) 1-handers are primary
only (sorry, no Sword of the GreatRatio in the off-hand).  Second, we
have lower skill-caps on Offense and weapon skills the are a much
more serious limitation to our damage output than not having Dual
Wield.  In fact, unless VI was stupid enough to make our high ratio
1-handers equipable in the secondary slot (wouldn't you like to put a
28/30 1hs in your off hand?), the only real effect would be to make
us even better at taking/holding agro, our 2-handers would still be
best option for damage output.
