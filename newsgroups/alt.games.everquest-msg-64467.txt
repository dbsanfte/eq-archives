What's the standard donation for a res?

Some guy volunteered to res me (I didn't seek him out), and afterwards I
gave him 25pp, plus the whole load of buffs (I'm a 35 shaman).  He's like
"gee thanks, I'll use this for spells or something."  Was that enough or
am I being a cheap bastard?  That seemed about right to me.  Esp.
considering what clerics usually give me for my SoW (nothing!).
