Um, you did read what he said at the end   and I QUOTE:

"(Note, this is written with a rather dark humor in mind. Hopefully
someone won't be offended by it...)"

Yes he was kidding, or rather talking in DARK HUMOR.... and he was
polite in the stance of hopefully someone won't be offended by it..
as you obviously were.... but to say he was not kidding would be in
contrast to his "disclaimer" at the end.

ahh... let us not pretend to know what goes on in the minds of other
humans.... hell lets us not pretend to understand what goes on in our
own minds..  8 )
