I had the same symptoms and it turned out to be my CPU fan.  The
computer seemed ok when just running Windows but wouldn't last very
long when running EQ (or EQ2 - I can't remember)

I'd have thought that it would happen with the other games but if it
happens after, say, 30 minutes and you don't play your other games for
that long then it might look like it is only EQ and actually be just
time based.
