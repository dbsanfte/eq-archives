Umm.. thanks for the advice.. but I won't be taking it!

I got vacation days piled up.. no reason I can't take a half day to do
something I enjoy. Heck, I have to take time off to wait for a plumber to
come to my house.. that's a much worse use of time off.

And, I don't need to be "effective" on this raid.. I'm going to see what
it's like, and to have fun. If my guild leader and guild are cool with it,
what's the big deal?

Lighten up a bit!

Anita
