All I can think of is the new LoY zones... especialy Dulak.   OMG...
pull something... run back to group... the mob has decided to run
complelety around the zone to get to you. Thank the gods that aggro
range is rather small for the assist.   
Then when the mob get to you... you step two steps to the right...
they run WAY away... and back.... then move again... they run WAY
away... and back.... then move again... they run WAY away... and
back....
Saw a Druid and a Bard doing this with snared mobs... literaly
receiving NO damage because of the pathing..
Honestly it pissed me off, as much as the Fear sploit in PoJ (glad
they fixed this)

I am very ready for them to fix the pathing in this zone.
Was disappointed at how bad it was for being a new zone as well.
