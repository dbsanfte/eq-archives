Think it was the fact that active guild normally means one that raids
regularly and you were referring to yourself as a casual player, as in not
playing that often...erm..to put it another way, it sounds like a not so
dedicated gamer wants to join a guild of dedicated gamers...

Anyway, ignoring how it read...No, don't know of any...then I can only speak
for one server. You do not need a guild to get by...the guild I am in rarely
has any sort of raids and couldn't muster the numbers to be effective at
high level anyway (not now) but that has not stopped players reaching 60 and
gaining their epics.
What you need to do is just play, levelling slow is a problem in a way as
you lose touch with people you meet, they move on and up while you don't and
then one day you are grouped with their twinked alt. This does not stop you
playing or enjoying the game tho, pickup groups are easy to find (until
around 48th) and after 10th (and assuming you are an amiable type of guy)
you'll likely get guild invites anyway.

I doubt there are any Guilds that are going to let a 1st level character
into their ranks without any introduction to him at all...worded as you have
(it makes no mention of class or level for character) it "sounds" like you
are asking for is a guild to power level you (no one has any need to group
till after 6th and it's quite easy for most classes to solo to 20) I don't
think that's what you meant, just how it read.
