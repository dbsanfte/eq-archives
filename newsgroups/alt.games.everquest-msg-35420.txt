IMHO the major difference will be it's fresh and new.

The PvE will be a lot like EQ. The main differences are

1. Advanced Quest Engine with dynamic/personalized. (Quest xp can als
account for a fair amount needed each level).
2. All classes suppose to be able to play solo.
3. Classes use skill trees.
4. Item deterioration.

Some of EQ's annoyances--for better or worse--are addressed like
downtime, twinking, camping, binding stones, corpse recovery,
tradeskill tedium, etc.

The PvP is most different. It's realm based, i.e. you can't attack
members of your own realm. You're supppose to be 99% safe from PvP in
your homeland with PvP combat occurring on borderlands.

PvP doesn't yield xp, but something called rp (realm points). As you
gain realm points, you gain titles which make you more powerful.

PvP is also includes sieges with one side defending an outpost. These
outpost can contain artifacts. Artifacts give a small boon to every
member of your realm and can be captured (actually that's the goal of
PvP--to caputre artifacts.)
