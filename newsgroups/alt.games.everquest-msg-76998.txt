Combine Scimitar (or any other magical Scim. in your price range)
It is magic, and will allow you to hunt Wisps. Should run about 80pp
at the Gypsie camp in North Karana. After you get a magic Weapon hunt
Wisps. You turn the Greater Lightstones in to one of the Gypsies at
the NK camp for exp and a book you can sell back to her for 7-8pp. You
can also turn in the regular lightstones for exp, or sell to a vendor
for 7-8gp
