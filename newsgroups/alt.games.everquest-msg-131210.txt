Other things to try since you are sharing a cable connection:

1. Make sure its not the machine which is doing NAT/firewalling which is 
getting in the way. Check the logs if possible.

2. Make sure your datarate set in datarate.txt is a decent value - mine 
is 9.

3. I would suggest looking at your physical network hardware too but 
since it worked fine in ME this is most probably not the case. Still 
worth a look though.
