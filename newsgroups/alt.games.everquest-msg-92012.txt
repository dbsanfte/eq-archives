OK, we all know that KC has idiots, but how stupid do you have to be to 
not have established a server norm after 2 freakin' years?  Maybe early on 
there was a bit of confusion about which was the better side to train out, 
but you would think that SOME sort of consensus would have been reached.  
I don't spend that much time in KC anymore, but we do camp Verix a bunch, 
so I'm in and out.  I can think of maybe 1 time in the past 6 months where 
some idiot trained left, and was immediately flamed by the entire zone.  
There was no confusion; nobody was arguing that training left is a good 
idea; nobody discussed the merits of right v. left.  
Why would ANY server not have figured out that consistancy is good?  How 
in the hell can anyone spend ANY time in KC and not know which way to 
train?  What moron is able to find his way into KC, get a group, set up on 
wrong side, and then bitch about it?  Why doesn't the rest of the zone 
just politely inform him that the standard is to train <whichever was is 
standard on that server> and then give some reinforcement?
Damn, in a zone like KC you need a place to wait for groups, rez, med, 
whatever.  People who are so ignorant as to camp on the <wrong_exit> side 
probably should be trained in the interest of removing them from the gene 
pool.  The only thing that would make it better would be to do it again 
and again as they try to rez and recover on the same wrong side.
I think it's pretty universal in EQ that you train right and rez left.  I 
KNOW it's done that way on Innrouuk, and suspect it's that way on every 
other server (except maybe AB, silly euros).  (At this point I fully 
expect to hear that every other server trains left and I'm an idiot.)  
Anyway, why do people even stress about this?  Is there anything wrong 
with training right as usual and then telling the idiots, "Sorry, but on 
this server we train right." and letting the rest of the zone call them 
idiots?
