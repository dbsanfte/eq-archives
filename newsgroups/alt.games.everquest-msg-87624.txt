More RAM, if at all possible. It's inexpensive and worth it. Otherwise,
my system is identical, and I can do everything but the moon. I can
handle the moon for short periods- but I get migraines if I play longer
than half an hour.

Most socializing is done in guildchat, or group chat. So I have never
spent time in town just "soaking up the atmosphere". Time spent in town
is refilling supplies or tradeskills, the latter of which is completely
optional.

There are several set "camps"  where you go to get a particular drop.
However, there are many other ways/places to earn XP and coin, and
usually those drops are for sale from other players. There are always
several mobs to kill in any location.

Crowds gather to kill one mob (or invade a particular locale) on raids,
but that's the only time I've ever seen true crowds.

Here's a good FAQ that I like:
