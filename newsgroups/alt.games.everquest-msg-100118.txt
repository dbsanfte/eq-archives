With regard to lower level groups, you do have a certain
responsibility to stick it out and do your best to help the party live
through it. You can't run every time a bad pull happens, because they
will happen often. Naturally, the higher in level you get the more
important it will be for you to camp in bad situations for TPW rezzing
afterward.

That said, if the puller repeats the same mistake (i.e. act of
stupidity) over and over, bail. Experience tells  you what the outcome
is going to be (after all, he's gotten you killed at least once
pulling this stunt already, right?), so beat a hasty retreat. In this
case it is also VERY important that you notify the group that you are
running. Otherwise, they may all stick it out counting on your
well-timed heals.

Regardless, don't hesitate to express your concern with the puller's
methods or perhaps offer a bit of friendly advice. If it gets to the
point that he's pissed you off, leave the group. Any group leader
worth their salt should have tried to reign this player in by this
point anyway.

My 2cp worth.
