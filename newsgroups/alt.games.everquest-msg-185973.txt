Kill spiderlings and make threads, kill spiders and make swatches, kill
cats, wolves, bears and collect pelts.

Sell swatches in bazaar, and make leather paddign from the threads and
pelts, and sell in bazaar.

You'll make fair bit of cash dependign on your servers economy.

With the Ranger, forage vegetables and sell them by the stack for stupid
money in bazaar.
