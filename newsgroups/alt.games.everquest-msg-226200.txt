Well, I joined in my first pickup raid last night to go after my first 
raid-level mob, Naggy. It was quite an experience. We wiped three times, 
having the wurm (is Nagafen male or female, btw?) down to 38% on the last 
one. It was determined that our raid force of 30-ish was just too light 
on DPS. We also suffered from a bit of miscommunication and lack of 
organization. Who woulda thunk that, "CHARGE IN THE DOORWAY!" meant run 
to the doorway and stop when *Naggy* got in the doorway? Being my first 
mob of this magnitude I was doing little that didn't involve following 
someone else's lead, but it seemed there were several who were tripped up 
by that particular bit of mid-fight spontaneity. After all, we had been 
instructed to fight on the stairs, not at the doorway.

Anyway, we had a good time with it. It was quite the adventure. The guy 
leading the chaos actually did a pretty decent job staying on top of 
things despite the circumstances. He seemed to put an effort into knowing 
what class/level everyone was for group setups, though I did see some 
oddities in the group compositions that I wasn't going to add to the 
chaos by making too much of, such as:

-- Multiple bards in some groups while none in some others. At one point 
I was in a group that contained four bards. Someone did say something to 
this and it was pared down to two.

-- Multiple enchanters in one group while none in any others. Maybe just 
an oversight.

-- No healers at all in several groups. I understand this might be the 
strategy on huge raids, but is it common in smaller ones too? I got the 
sense that if I gained aggro and started taking damage, (heh, actually, 
once I started taking damage, I was pretty much finished at the same 
time) I may as well hang it up, because no one who could help would 
notice.

Being a pickup raid, it was also crazy with people coming and going. It 
does bother me when a group/raid wipes and people bail without helping 
others at least recover their corpses. I'd like to think duty to the 
guild would eliminate much of that in guild raids.

Lastly, it was scheduled to start at 8:30pm and take "an hour and a half 
tops" according to fearless leader. We didn't even zone in to the dungeon 
until after 10:00, what with all the prep, people who evidently don't own 
clocks and idiots who decide at the last minute to run to the bazaar to 
buy resist gear. Grr...

So, come 3:00am we decided to call it a night. Like I said, it was some 
good experience for me (not xp of course, but I was lucky enough to end 
up about where I started in that department), but I don't know how eager 
I'll be to jump into the next pickup raid that comes along.
