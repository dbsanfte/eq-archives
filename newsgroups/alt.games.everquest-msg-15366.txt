This is a misconception.  Rogues can not take all of it. 
They can only take a portion.  If a mob has say 1pp 3 gold 4
silver 6 copper.  The rogue can only get like 1 gold, 2
silver 3 copper, if I remember correctly.  We can't pick
them dry, but we can pickpocket a portion of their loot, we
can't pickpocket magic loot either i don't believe.  We can
pickpocket Dvinn's heart however, along with gnoll and orc
scalps, and a few other goofy "impossible" things to steal.
