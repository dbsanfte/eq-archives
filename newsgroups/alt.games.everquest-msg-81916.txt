Contains a little spoiler...

Pretty Much true, If i remember right, he had a brother, the two of them had
a sort of decision to make, Elrond took the Elf way and lived as long as the
normal elves, his brother decided to go the way of Humans and became mortal
(although a long lived mortal). His brothers name escapes me, i will look it
up later :) although i think he was the ancestor of the kings of gondor.

I think this also has a bearing on the decision Arwen has to make, when she
decides to shack up with Aragorn, she casts aside her elven heritage and
takes the short human lifespan.

but its been a while could be some mixed up info here. If you want the full
story of what goes on, get the "Silmarallion" its a tough read though. and
those  names get a bit hard to follow as everyone seems to have about 5
aliases.


Naddo - more heroic than a hobbit !
