The first book is available on Amazon, the rest needs to be ordered from
Australia, perhaps other countries as well.  I don't remember what store in
particular I ordered from, did a google search for australian book stores.
There is also a website devoted to her, and links from there to where the
books can be purchased.  I would recommend buying the first one, decide if
you like, it, if so, order the rest.  Still waiting impatiently for the rest
of the books.
