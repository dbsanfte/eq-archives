At level 5 the skells will be too tough. Might be ok at 6 though with good
equipment. Those skells are great if they arnt already camped.
Theres 3 at te tower, 4 at the druid rung, and another one behund a stone
just sw of the druid ring. 2 at the tower are in each other agro range (the
on in the tower and the on to its nw)

Crossroads would be another place you could hunt. 2 Guards there to run to.
