Reading this post of yours was a breath of fresh air.  Nice to see 
someone out there sees what is wrong with both the players and 
developers so clearly.  Best of all you pointed out the simple solution 
that some of us have been advocating for a long time.  You can limit the 
force that can be thrown at an encounter by simply controlling access to 
it.  With the new "raid" groups this becomes even more doable.  Create 
encounter for 18 or less people and let raid leader trigger access only 
if his raid force is 18 people or less, otherwise deny access.  Two 
guilds attempting to do same encounter at same time have no conflict as 
each spawns their own separate version of the encounter.  You can avoid 
flooding the world with drops from such encounters by limiting the 
access triggers rather than the encounter itself, without preventing two 
groups who both happen to decide to do the event on the same night from 
doing so provided they already have the trigger.

Someday, someone will figure out that when you create an environment 
that fosters or worse yet requires elephantine forces stuff gets 
trampled, namely fun.
