Fastest way to HK is to find a friendly druid, tp to EK and run up the
hill being careful not to drop off the edge - its a narrow path & a
long way down.

Running through Kithicor is pretty safe if you do it during the day,
however at night it turns nasty.  Invis vs Undead is your best chance
of getting through safely but theres always a chance you'll be seen.

Long before they introduced any means of transport other than
druid/wizzy tp I used to make the run on a regular basis doing the
stein of moggok quest.  When they intorduced the undead into Kithicor
it came as a bit of a shock!   The arrived for a haloween special &
never went away again!

As an aside the only part of the bard quest I really bothered with was
the run between Felwithe & Kelethin, short journey & back when I
started the few gp you got was very much worth while!!
