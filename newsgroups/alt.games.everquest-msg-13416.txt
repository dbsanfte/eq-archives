Not at all.  I have no problem whatsoever understanding why it's an exploit.
I made the improper assumption that you could follow the same logic.

It's an exploit because you have gained an advantage over a critter NOT
based on your intelligence but on stupid pathing.  Taking advantage of
pathing does not mean you've learned tactics, it means you've learned how to
exploit a poorly written line of code.  Does it make someone a tactician by
finding a way to bypass a program's intent and then continuing to do it?

Hopefully my answer provided that.  I'm not sure how else to word it.

Not at all apples and oranges.  The law states that when someone gives you
money accidentally that does not belong to you you are required to return
it.  Verant's rule says that when Verant gives you a line of code
accidentally that is not meant for your use, you are required to report it
and stop using it.
