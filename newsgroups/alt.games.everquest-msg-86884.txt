Maybe at certain levels, but so far, I have never had any trouble finding a
place to xp hunt that is not crowded.  EQ is really huge, there are a lot of
zones, there are a lot of zones for most any level.  There may be some
exceptions for some levels, if so, they are higher than me at 48.  Now, if
you are one of those that has to hunt in the same zone that everyone else
hunts in, then, well, it gets crowded.  If you do Orc Hill, CB, LoIO, OT,
DL, then, yes it is crowded, although, honestly I never had a problem
hunting in any of those zones either.
