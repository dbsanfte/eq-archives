Do you play a lot?  Some people play so much that it is pretty safe to just
start with /tell, without checking to see if there are on. :-)

Well, GFay has been around a lot longer than GF, and it is a well known port
spot.  A lot of people are probably not even aware there is a GF port.  So,
it is not too unreasonable for her to think GF met GFay.  So, the question
is, is GFay so odd a place for you to suggest a meeting at that it shold
have tipped her off?

I'd say no.  Did you tell her you were leaving right away for the meeting,
or just tell her to meet you?  If the latter, you might be a few minutes
finishing up something, and then getting a TL to GFay.  In that case, you'd
suggest meeting in GFay, rather than at the BB zone, because you'd know that
she can port to BB and get to GFay before you.
