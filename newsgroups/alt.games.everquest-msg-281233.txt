No you don't. :)

At level 6 you wander into blackburrow, the first gnoll you swing at 
immediately shouts "intruder! intruder!" and a dozen sentries proceed to 
pound you into oblivion.

At level 60 you return to blackburrow to farm something or other. Within 
2 or 3 minuts the zone is depopped and the gnolls won't set foot in the 
zone again until you leave. 

You'd still be able to hunt bears I guess.

:p
