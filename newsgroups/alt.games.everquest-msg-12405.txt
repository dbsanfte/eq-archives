Hi all,
The other day on Veeshan, I was wondering thru Freeport when I came
across a young Dwarf Paladin using a scottish accent. By that I mean,
all his IC posts were in Scottish, though he was quite happy to talk
OOC in 'normal' English. But it was quite amusing to hear this Dwarf
Paladin accuse my Barbarian Shaman of being a 'wee daft beggar' and
such. We got along famously for an hour or so.

Anyway - I was just wondering how many people out there use an accent
in IC conversations. Im thinking of adopting one myself - it just
added so much spice and 'realism' to talk to this little Scottish
bugger. Its somewhat harder to talk in a recognisable German accent
than it is to do a Scottish one though...

Thoughts?
