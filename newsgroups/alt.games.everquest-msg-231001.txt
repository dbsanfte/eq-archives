LOL been there; done that.  I also use a similar technique when
shooting arrows.  If I'm LOM and indoors (no mounts) I flip over to a
hotkey bank that has sit/stand as number 2 and archery as number 3. 
While sitting, I quickly press 2-3-2 to get a shot off while still
sitting 90% of the time.  Great for helping out after a battle rez,
when LOM and soloing, etc...
