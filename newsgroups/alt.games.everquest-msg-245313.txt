Literally, how I personally did it?

1. Wait till level 60 before trying.

2. Farm gorangas in ME for rare acrylia and some minuscle amount of
exp and maybe chance at shard. Get bored, get annoyed at their aggro
range. Start snaring everything that aggros you and run circles around
them, throwing lightning at 'em when they're huddled. Laugh at the
ease, kite up to 8 gorangas at once.

3. Do the same with the goranga scouts, since they are dark blue and
also likely to have acrylia.

4. Wait till 65, do the same with wyverns in CS (pesky tailoring!).
Get bored, start kiting up to 18 wyverns at once when nobody else is
in the zone. Observe that lag spikes are evil, and observe that you
haven't lived till you see a pile of a dozen wyverns walking in each
other's footsteps heading your way.
