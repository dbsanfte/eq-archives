From what you mention (and thats all I can go by) you are spending most of
your time soloing and "quad kiting", EQ is a social game, have you spent
much time grouping and hunting not so you get masses of XP but so you can
meet people and socialise? My advice would be to stop looking at your XP bar
and get out and have fun meeting people and grouping. If you are already
doing this, well then perhaps you do need a break - or perhaps make a newbie
char, try an evil race.
