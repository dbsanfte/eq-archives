What are you casting the CHeal on?  Rogues?
There's no fucking way celestial heal is even remotely as efficient as
complete heal on a warrior, unless said warrior is level 10.

In Velk, one cleric thought like you did, started chain casting
Celestial Heal on me (I had over 3900hps).  When she went OOM for the
second time after what I considered a fairly "slow" pull rate, I told
her to switch to CH and don't start CH until she sees the "so-and-so
goes into a berserker frenzy" message.

I increased the rate of pulls, she NEVER dropped below 60 mana--would
have pulled faster but fucking Velk is a zoo when you get more than 20
people in there.

Did your warrior have more than 2000hps?
If so, CH is more efficient unless the moron cleric casts it at 80%
health.

Level 51 warrior mostly in crafted.
Unless you're a gnome who didn't put all his points into STA, you
should have more than enough hps to make CH more efficient than any
other spell that cleric had.

As for all of two cleric buffs, excuse me, but as far as hp buffs are
concerned, there's only two series from a cleric that stack!
Resolution and Symbol.
