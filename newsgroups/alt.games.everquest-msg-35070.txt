I would say to use the Iksar Monk and Shaman combo.
Put all points in to stamina on the Monk, and into wisdom
for the Shaman. Monks rock with shaman buffs.

The kunark starting area is the best. If you are going to
twink get the monk Wu's fighting armor and the shaman
some Ornate chain if you don't have magic items for any slots.
Get the monk a couple of Fighting Batons. With this you wont have
to worry about equipment for a while and you can just hunt and
play.

Do the curscale armor quest, especially if you are not going to
twink to get some good early armor, also it is a great quest
for experience.
