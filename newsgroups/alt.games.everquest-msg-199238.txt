Centi SS is on Rogue (and Ranger too?), so I figured that made it
fair game.  Is the MoSS really being dumped for 50pp these days?
What a sad joke that is then, they changed the drops to be stupidly
rare for Ghoulbane, while the more effective MoSS has become junk
loot.

I think it was more a matter of giving one item per slot, dual wield
classes got 2 weapons.

Paladin archery cap is 75.  Once they added Cease (L9 PAL-only stun,
buyable in Shadowhaven) there was no point in any Paladin using a
bow, i.e. only newbs who don't know better and the anal retentive
have an excuse for even owning a bow (my opinion, ymmv).  Once the
Goranga Idol became common as dirt (price under 200pp) it became
even stupider for a Paladin to have a bow.  There was a use for a
bow when my first two Paladins were young, but both of them gladly
abandoned their bows the moment they scribed Stun at L30.  And back
then the only easily available and useful range item was the Kerran
Toy (2ac and 3agi, or something like that).
