    I can't speak for other pets but SK pets don't need to be holding
weapons to 'dual weild' once they have the skill. I can't remember if its
the 49 or 52 pet that first dual weilds, but they quad happily unarmed. The
main reason I give pets weapons, when I do, is that it makes them run around
less like a spastic rubber skeleton and more like a scary killing machine.

    Cool!
