Sounds like your still under level 10, and if thats the case, and the
looting rules of Vallon Zek are the same as Rallos Zek, then youve not
gotten looted becuase of the changed that were made where you show up with
all your equipment after dieing, until level 10.  I do know that this is the
case on Vallon, as Ive been PK'd as a newb many a time, and that is what has
lead to my deep seated hatred of Pecks, Haflings and Gnomes in specific : )
