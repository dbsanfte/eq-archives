I think a level 53 Warrior can solo the AC problem is can he stay healthy
with a 6 minute spawn time between Cyclops. Best thing is to get a druid or
Shaman with you since the don't need Jboots and can heal. TBoots can be
purchased in Sol A by Gnome Vendor they are Just as good only differences
are 1.5 sec cast time and cannot be cast on the run
