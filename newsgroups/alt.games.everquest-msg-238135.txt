Your being absurd. If I have *all* the marbles. Does that mean I'm
required to have marbles that don't exist too? Marbles that can't
exist?

The mundane meaning of having all the marbles... is simply having all
the marbles.

Now substitute powers for marbles, and you might see what I'm getting
it. He's all powerful because he has *all the powers*, not *most of
them*, All of them. Powers that don't  (and can't)  exist don't count
towards "all" any more than marbles that don't exist.

Nowhere did it need to be in a universe, flawed or not. It is

Not in any meaninful sense. If there was more than one, they'd be
identical (not equivalent, but identical). I don't think your grasping
the reach of the my definition of perfection.

Not really. Q was punished by the 'others'.  That Q had to submit to
the punishment implies that he wasn't the most powerful being in the
universe. (Don't ask for a detailed cite, I haven't watched STNG in
years, and I can't bear it now -- too human-ist [human is to human-ist
as race is to racist])

Simple. Moral choices are local choices. They are made with an
incomplete knowledge of the environment. The choice is judged moral if
its the best choice one could make from the information available, it
is irrelevant whether it was the best choice overall.

That is precisely why our criminal system makes such a big hullaballoo
about a criminals state of mind. Guilt and degree of punishment hinge
directly on what the accused beleives and intended to accomplish with
his actions. The outcome is largely irrelevant.

This isn't a 'practical solution' that we suffer with because we as
humans can't see the whole picture. This is because we as humans have
collectively agreed that the whole picture doesn't matter, that the
only thing that matters is the information available, and the intended
results the accused wished to bring about with that information.

We deliberately treat attempted murder as a serious offence, even
though there might have been no consequences at all to anybody. That
we charge, after the fact, someone with endangering somebody else,
knowing full well that nobody got hurt demonstrates that we
collectively beleive the result is not the most important factor.
