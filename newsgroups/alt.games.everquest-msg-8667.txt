Unless you can be a paladin or warrior who follows Mithaniel Marr. Problem is,
the gems used by Marr (diamond) and Rallos Zek (ruby, I believe) are very
expensive, meaning that imbued ANYTHING will be very expensive (but worth the
cost, IMO.)

On the other hand, Rosewhite follows Karana, whose sacred stone is something
picked up along the side of the road (ie plains pebble, foraged only.) Stats on
Karana imbued are not that hot.
