I've always found the book of Job interesting with regard to your point
about testing the faithful.  Particularly how twice (at the beginning of
each of the first two chapters of Job) Satan is referred to as presenting
himself to the Lord at the same time as the 'sons (plural) of God'.

You're right in that nowhere in the scripture does it directly refer to
Satan as being against God.  The evidence is circumstantial at best ...
since the old boy was tossed out of heaven (Revelation 12, I believe), he'd
probably hold a grudge.  What better way to get back to God than to mess
with the creature which was made in God's image?

As I think of it, most of the rest of that belief probably comes from
Milton.
