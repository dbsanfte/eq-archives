The run of AAs for necros is pretty simple for the title.. Run3, Regen3.

Then SCM3.

.. and then things change based upon your play style.

I went CF2 because I kite a LOT and, well, either I've learned how to play with
interrupts or it's working or I see no difference at all. AAs are like that.

I would have gone Theft of Life 1 before CF1 simply because it's great to see:

Vydal has performed an exceptional heal! (1700)

And cause great oos and aahs from guildies.

My next step is Pet Discipline simply because I find myself doing most of the
pulling now since our regular XP group doesn't contain a monk or SK. After that
I'm heading for CA3, LR5 and ID3 simply because getting hit while pulling 
immediately puts me down to about 60% of health, even with Virtue, so either I 
need to stop pulling while liching or start avoiding those hits!)

The ultimate topic of AAs from the necro board is here:
