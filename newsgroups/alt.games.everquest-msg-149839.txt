If you're not hunting to sell them, then consider if it is worth the cost to
help fuel the economy & travel to the Bazaar, or if not, then EC is still
probably somewhat successful (for those who aren't high enough LV to get to
the FEW portals to Luclin for the Bazaar).
    Otherwise I'd say you're hunting in the appropriate areas.  Ferrott (NE
corner) has a large supply, as well as some in Field of Bone, also might try
that newbie zone for the Halflings, EC has a few though not as many or as
often as other zones (& they're more spread out too).  East Freeport & West
Freeport newbie areas have a small amount, then if you're high enough LV
might try the larger spider room in Guk (Froglok area, though that is
partially considered Ogre & Troll area still), and I'm not sure how well you
can solo in there (not been there except for as a <LV10 Ogre to learn why
I'm not going back until properly learning the area).
    I think those are the only places that have large enough supply of
spiders to consider dealing with.
