While we're on changes, and since you're here, I'm sure more than a
few of us would be interested in hearing your opinion on the changes
that have come down the line since you left. (soublinders, smoothing
the xp curve up to 50 (killing hell levels), adding hybrids to
halfings and gnomes, removal of book-medding before level 35, so on)
Were any of these changes in the works before you left?
