Just keep in mind, if people here don't go randomly throwing punches
out at people from our forums, they won't throw any back.  But as we've
been told, that's what thick skin is for (plus leet damage shields!). 
Lurkerr does like to go around posting weird one/two liners around the
boards, but if he's a smart guy he won't do that with the gateway to
here.  Especially since this doesn't work like a message board.

When I discovered what sort of place this was I knew that it wouldn't
be the same place I'm used to dancing around, as I would expect most or
all of the poeple to be adults in a job of some sort as opposed to a
normal forum.  A completely new and different challange to deal with. 
Not that I'm parading around looking for a fight here.

I'm sure that Ogmuk added this Gateway to our forum to broaden our area
for EQ chat, not to dump trash into other people's areas.
