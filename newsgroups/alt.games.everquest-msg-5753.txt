A well put together and totally coherent post... but completely missing the
mark on one point and striking the mark squarely on another.  First, this is
alt.games.everquest, created for the discussion of all things everquest
amazingly enough.  Unlike flight simulator games, there are no people here
who have day jobs as dark elf enchanters; so there is always somewhat of a
learning curve.  Even if all the contributors to this newsgroup knew
everything there was to know about everquest, most (if not all) would not be
so boorish as to post totally off-topic messages in a feeble attempt for
attention.  The truly accomplished in the 'art of flaming' can hold their
own amongst more willing opponents on the alt.hipcrime... groups and the
alt.flame... groups.  It is certainly not a measure of intellect or wit to
post off-topic messages, but it is a good measure of ignorance and
immaturity.

On the point you had correct, there is nothing anyone here can do about
off-topic posts except continue to filter out the people who post them.  So,
if any posters from the FA group want to contribute anything meaningful to
this group, they can start marching in the a.g.e band or just ride in the
band-wagon; but please do not stand in the weeds on the side of the road
throwing rocks as the parade goes by.
