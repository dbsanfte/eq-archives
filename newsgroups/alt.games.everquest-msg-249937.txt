And its always capped by the maximum items that can be bought and
sold. Of which even the best don't even hold a candle to the no-drop
gear that has to be played for.

Of course it has.. but the revelation in this instance is that
Everquest is more than a game.. something you've tried to deny through
many a Monopoly analogy.

The problem is that a lot of things changed when the world was made
subsistant. Once that happened it went from both virtual and fantasy
to reality.

Of course not... but at the same time allowing investment into the
game is not the same as turning it into a replica of the real world.
You still have good ol Norrath... the same ol zones.. just with a
different revenue source with which to buy and purchase things in that
world.

I'm truly stunned you brought a story-telling term like deus ex
machina into the conversation. Deus ex machina would be like.. you're
in the middle of wiping to AoW and suddenly Cazic Thule comes down and
gives it a heart attack and it dies. To try to claim allowing the
investment of capital into the world has anything to do with a
story-telling aspect of the game is a stretch to say the least. Bear
in mind, nobody is suggesting items get auto-generated, simply that
the ones currently in the environment can be bought using just one
more method of payment.
