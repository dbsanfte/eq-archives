Ok... I'm open for suggestions. Our guild had previously killed all of
the Kunark dragons except Trak. One of our bards was up to the last step
of her epic and we happened to have a group down at Juggs and found the
undead bard up. We assembled our raid force and even called in some of
our allies. 

This was our "A" team, too. We've done some of the other dragons now
with very "non-optimal" forces, both for size and class distribution,
but on this one we had them all. Five groups. 8 or 9 level sixties and
everyone 50+, average probably above 55.

I had about one minute to chat with Martin before we engaged and got a
sick feeling that we weren't doing it right.

We attempted our usual routine of holding the casters and extra melee
back while the Warlord got aggro, then planned on calling the melee in
and then the casters last. Just about everyone had poison resists over
200 (mine was 238) and the groups with bards in them had PR through the
freaking roof.

We got smoked like a salmon at a Jewish debutant's party.

Half the melee were dead or dying before they got called in to attack.
When the call for nukes came in, 90% of the casters were already dead.
(And we were quite a ways away from the dragon.) I made it to within
about fifty yards of Trakenon and dropped dead before I finished casting
a single nuke.

Fortunately, our necro with her clicky robe and clerics with click
sticks got everything sorted at zone in in pretty short order, but it
was nothing less than a massacre.  Trak obviously only had to slap on a
couple of bandages before retiring for a cold beer by himself. (We
killed all of his little friends at least.)

This ain't your grandma's dragon, obviously. Do we need to be hiding the
entire raid force way back at Juggs for this? Or do most people just
zerg him and start slashing and blasting right from the first second,
and to hell with who has aggro?  I'm leaning towards a zerg rush at this
point.

Any tips appreicated. My people want blood revenge, but we need a new
strat or I see nothing but a repeat of this Little Big Horn scene
playing out again.
