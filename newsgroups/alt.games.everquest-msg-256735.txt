There's no reason why being evil would preclude killing evil gods.
Particularly now that the gods have forsaken their mortal followers,
there is little reason to follow them if your goal is personal
advancement (which clearly is the goal of most PCs in Everquest).  As
recent events have shown, not even the "religious" classes
(e.g. cleric, ddruid) need the gods (or at least not their favour) for
their powers.

Of course forcing everyone into playing pretty much an immoral
mercenary to be able to advance might be considered not to exactly
promote interesting roleplaying through game design...  I'm not sure
this applies to PoP, though, because the only "good" god you kill is
Mithaniel Marr, I think, and there may be some justification for why
good guys would do that in the storyline, for all I know.
