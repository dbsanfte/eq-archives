Interesting link from the WoW Beta Boards.

Blizzard has said they may or may not be able to
get in "racial traits" prior to release. That is a pretty fundamental
component, and can have a significant impact on what type of
character a person wants to play. Heck, you choose your
race 5 minutes after you start playing the game.

Blizzard is one of the few companies with a reputation of only
releasing finished products, but they've clearly taken a position
that it will be released on X date, regardless of the current
state of the game.

This is one case where having EQ2 and WoW in a neck-and-neck
race is not good. They're both going to end up releasing products
that aren't quite done.
