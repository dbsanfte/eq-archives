according to a post a read below it says servers go down at 11am GMT and go
back up at 5pm GMT its now 6:30 GMT still no luck any one have any clue
because I've been trying to get on for about an hour I was half way through
a quest for an my epic when I had to go someplace and when I got a back like
5pm I logged in but all servers where down and chat server wouldn't let me
in
anyone have any ideas?
