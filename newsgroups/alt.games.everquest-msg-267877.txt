It's up to you - move on when you get bored there.

You can't level beyond 6 on the island but you can gain upto 199% more 
XP (assuming it's unchanged since beta) and gaining xp on the island is 
easy so for fast levelling you might want to maximise your xp on the 
island and then when you get to your city you can do the citizen quest 
straight away and will jump straight to level 8. Doing some quests will 
then get you to level 10 and your class choice pretty quickly.

Also if you want to do tradeskills I would suggest spending a lot of 
time getting gathering, mining, etc skil l increases as it seems to be 
easier on the island than the rest of the game, and you need to get 
those skills up to 40 to be able to use them in the tier 2 zones.
