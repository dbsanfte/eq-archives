Mick,

I have rebuilt my computer several times throughout my EQ career and I know 
that it works to save the EQ directory and then copy it back to the new 
comp.

I'm guessing that your shortcut is pointing to the game exe file rather than 
to the patcher exe file. I'm at work so I can't look up what it should be 
pointing to, but maybe some other person will check their set-up. If not, 
I'll try to remember to check when I get home in 4-5 hours.

Good luck,

Mike W.
