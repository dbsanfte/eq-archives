** Patch Changes **

- Added tools to help us track serverside zone issues that have come
  up since the release of Luclin in an effort to solve some continuing
  problems.
- Orb of Lost Souls will now have a casting time.
- Geomantic Focus has had its effect changed.
- Fixed a problem that prevented Barbarian custom Velium helms from
  being visible to other PCs.
- Corrected a problem with horse acceleration and deceleration in
  extremely low framerate situations.  Acceleration and deceleration now
  seem the same at high and low framerates.
- Fonts should display correctly, regardless of desktop settings.
- Hoober and his pet have returned.  Yes, we used the singular... only
  one pet.
- The wind instruments "ivory horn" and "ivory flawless horn" can now
  be equipped.
- Added Beastlord Guildmasters to Firiona Vie and The Overthere
- Added several merchants to Freeport (North and East) to round out the
  availability of trade supplies there.

** Note about upcoming changes to the Temple of Veeshan **

- In the next patch, we are making a few changes to the monster population
  in Temple of Veeshan.  Places that were previously safe to camp, may
  not be any longer.  Please be sure to not camp deep within the Temple
  of Veeshan on Wednesday night, or you may be unpleasantly surprised
  following the patch.
