Go to unrest, and get in a group and just loot stuff, skele's drop a fair
bit of gold 4-9 on average and often gems and such like which sell from 1pp
upwards! Also loot the yard trash and train kills that are lying around a
high level charcters leave stuff on them.
I made about 40-50 plat and hour, not loads but you are leveling whilst you
are doing it, and when you get to level 23+ you can solo the lower levels
just be carefull of trains!
