Actually, if you upgrade your card to a Geforce2, you'll run fine in all but
SoL expansion.

EQ has more emphasis on adventuring/socializing than on trade skills.
That's not to say you can't spend most of your time doing them...but you'll
need to level-up and get loot to finance them.  Don't expect to ever really
make much of a profit from them.

Yes there are certain spawns with uber loot that are camped sometimes 24/7.
But EQ is HUGE....there are some zones where you may be the only person
there.
