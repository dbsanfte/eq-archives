Its also a duplicate of an AA.

I'm one of those who has put up with their BS for the 8th year now.  
Although it most likely will be ending now because Sony refuses to honor 
their contract (despite what they claim on their message board).  They 
just told me changing my credit card number voided the price.   Even 
though you can't update your credit card number unless you cancel 
first.  How convenient for them.  I believe something like that can get 
someone locked up.

To quote 'Roaroar', LAME!!!

Putting up with Soe's BS for 7-8 years and thats all you get? Thats
more like a Wiz/Dru spell.

I'm no where near 8 years but I'd be pretty po'd at that.
