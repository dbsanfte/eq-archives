Sorry to be responding to this so late.  I've been having a bit of
trouble getting my news reader to let me send posts, and maturely dealt
with it by just wandering away from Usenet altogether for a while (that
showed it who was boss!)

   The server merger pool has already been won and laid to rest.  I
still have to say, though, that I am pretty surprised at the speed at
which the various servers are folding in on themselves.  Two years ago,
heck, even maybe just one year ago, I would have been inclined to flame
anyone who predicted this outcome.

    I still think that EQ will be around for its 10th anniversay... but
I'm not willing to bet any money on it now.

Anne
