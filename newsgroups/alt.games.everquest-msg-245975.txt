Sounds like this is what the mysterious message was about that I got
while AFK in the bazaar.  I had all shouts/ooc/auctions filtered off,
and at about 2:30pm PDT I got:

   You sense something is about to happen somewhere in the lands o Norrath.
   Something exciting that could benefit you in you adventuring expertise.

(Typos are from the original. :-)  Since I had all the chatter turned off
I missed any discussion there may've been in the bazaar, so I had no idea
what it was about or even where "in the lands o Norrath" it was.  Sounds
like my level 2 bazaar mule is glad he didn't go mess with it. :-)
