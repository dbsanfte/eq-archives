I was in a pickup group last night and we didn't have
ANY trouble doing them from the time I joined until
the group disbanded.   As a guess, people get more
familiar with them as they level (we were doing part
of armor quest 2 from Qeynos.)

But you're only talking seconds, not minutes.  Completing
an HO only takes as long as each class recognizing their
symbol and the cast time for each part -- maybe 10 to
20 seconds?

When you have multiple classes in a group?   Easy, one
person does the HOs, one uses their special attacks in
the time between them.   That balances the power usage.

Yes.

Because they're doing their part during the time between
HOs -- AND getting the benefits from them being done.
For example, two priests:  one takes primary healer,
one nukes or spot heals as part of the HOs.   No one
is going to think the primary healer isn't a critical part
of the group...

There's the "bad assumption."   You do NOT want to
constantly chain HOs.   You want to do establish aggro
from the pull (non-HO), HO, spot heal/DoT/nuke,
HO, spot-heal/DoT/nuke, etc..

Think of a DD class in EQ -- you did NOT simply start
chain-casting nukes.   You waited for aggro to be established,
nuked, waited for hate to disperse, nuked, and so on.   The
only time you really went full out was at the end of a fight.
HO is the same thing -- except you have part of the group
doing the HOs (one from each archtype) and the other two
doing their damage/heals/whatever during the "lull" between.
A group could even let them do solo HOs -- group HO,
solo HO by person 5, solo HO by person 6, repeat.

But -- yes, SOME actions break HOs.  SOME do NOT.
Heals, for instance, seem to be tolerated fairly well.  What
you NEVER do is trigger an HO while one is being
worked OR 'cast' while the trigger symbol is up.  Other
than that it seems fairly tolerant -- at least from a priest
POV.   I would *guess* the same is true for other
classes "defining" abilities.
