Excellent suggestion.. try to filter out "others hits". That will relieve
you of 75% (est.) of chat text. Believe me.. it is a big help. I
occasionally turn it on to see how other members of my party are hitting
just out of curiosity but turn it off again. Too much information and if
you're keeping log files it's a God send.
