I just posted this on the Sony tech support forum, but figured I would
post here also, since I have seen similar problems reported but no
solution posted.

Background: I quit EQ a while ago and smashed my CDs ;-)
I gave in to temptation and downloaded eqpatch.exe from the
Sony boards and downloaded original EQ and Kunark, the only
two products for which I am licensed.

Anyway, some sounds were missing, e.g. my footsteps, my spell effects,
jumping, getting hit, DING! levelling sound etc. From searching
around, it seems that some people who purchased only the EQ trilogy
pack have this issues too. Here is what worked for me ...

After days of trying to work out why I couldn't hear my own footsteps,
spell effects, jumping, getting hit, and the good old DING! sound on
leveling, and buying a new soundcard that I didn't need, 
I finally figured out what the problem was.

Apparently EQ sounds are stored in .PFS files. Looking in my EQ
directory, I only had SND3,4,5,6 and 12.PFS files (I only have the
original EQ and Kunark expansion). Apparently SND1.PFS and SND2.PFS
are not checked by the EQ patcher for some reason, and these are the
files in which the missing sounds appeared
to be stored.

If the EQ trilogy users with similar sound problems don't have these
files, 
you can get them from Sony here:

http://patch.everquest.com:7000/patch/everquest/shadowsLuclin/snd1.pfs.gz

http://patch.everquest.com:7000/patch/everquest/shadowsLuclin/snd2.pfs.gz

Just right click on the links and save the files to your EQ directory,
then use WINZIP to unzip them.
