    The ruins are part of the Combine Empire, the ancient civilization that 
build the wizard spires all across Norrath. There's a few quests that 
involve the NPCs in those ruins. It's a bit of a waste because of the size 
of the occupied versus empty space there, but honestly a lot of Kunark has 
wasted space. Has anyone ever turned right after exiting the tunnel from 
Lost Valley and visited that part of the Dreadlands?
