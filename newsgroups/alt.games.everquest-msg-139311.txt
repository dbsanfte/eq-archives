most awesome group i ever had was necro (me), necro, mage, mage,
wizard and enchanter. i was pulling in DL and i didnt care how many
mobs i rounded up.
i ended up almost getting mad at myself wasting mana cause most mobs
wouldnt last beyond my cast time. i think perhaps AOE groups would be
the only thing better because pets wouldnt be taking their share of
xp.
