    There was a thread on Graffe's asking "what would you play if you had to
start from level 1 again?" Many of the wizards that responded said they'd
play some class that can solo well (druid, necro, monk) up until they could
camp the AC for JBoots. Then they'd start a wizard, camp the AC for JBoots
for the wizard, and play the wizard as a main. That says a lot about the
difficulty of the class at low levels, and about how much wizards love their
class.
