Ah that rings a bell... shows my knowledge of bards ey :)

Im a monk not a bard :)

Haha I remember reading that before, kinda cool how 1 person can change an
entire server (removng the pvp level in certain zones)

On Prexus we have LW, BW, RW (left wall, back wall etc) then FF, which is
your LF and UF in 1. Others are eyes, tents, pits, and deep pits.... I set
up my "camp" in the dip opposite eyes, looking down at the 2 upper level
statues who spawn.

Well his guild is allied with a guild who together can kill Vindi, and I
think Doze.. so not "upper" level raids, but they can achieve some stuff
(they have failed each time on Sontalak so far).. I haven't been to akheva
for a while, but in the week my guild pharmed the Itraer, I didn't recall
mind burrowers to be particularly tough (as far as having a raid crew there
goes)

D1 sets up in the frenzied room (who drops the IFS) and covers that room,
the "disco" and other room with 3 mobs in.  D2 is anything past the
doorway.. ie the 2 golems, necro room, pickler, commander and second "disco"
The rest are pretty standard I think... UZO (upper zone out), LZO (lower
zone out), Crypt, Necro (all the mobs leading upto the crypt door), Gang
(where staff of the waterwalker and gangerous mask drops), Chef, and King.

D2 generally roams, from the necro room to library, pickler+brogg, then
commander+d2.. now ae groups are more common though, they are combined into
1 camp more often
