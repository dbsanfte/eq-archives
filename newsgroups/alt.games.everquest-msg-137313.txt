The world is full of people that live for nothing but to cause others
misery - and I hate them for it.

Theft should never be condoned. I cannot think of one instance where it is
acceptable to take the possessions of another. Thieves make others miserable
for their own gain - and I hate them for it.

I am absolutely stunned as to why there is even a debate. Theft is taking
something that does not belong to you. The OP took something that did not
belong to him... period.

I am not angry that people don't agree with me. I am simply annoyed with how
some don't even think this is wrong. Granted, I'm not even a terribly good
person, and I find it difficult to pity others, but I certainly don't go out
of my way to fuck others over...

Of course, most people are selfish, cruel, and inconsiderate, anyhow.
