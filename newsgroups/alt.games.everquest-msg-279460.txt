As a few have mentioned, KEI, Temp, and Virtue can only be cast by one
class each while SoW can be cast by Ranger, Druids, Shaman, and
Beastlords.  Add to that the fact that 2 of those classes get it at 14
and the other two get it at 30.  More than 4 times, probably more like
8-10 times as many players online at any given time, are capable of
casting SoW.
