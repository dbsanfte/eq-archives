You do have a point, though think of it this way. If all the money would
fall into a plat sink, say everyone buys a horse and the total amount of
plat on a server drops from 23 bazzilion to 48pp, then the entire plat based
economy is history. The plat is gone. It will be back as mobs drop plat, but
still.

And there we have the main problem. From day zero, the total amount of plat
on a server just keeps growing and growing, there is no end to it. This is
known as inflation and inflation is not a good thing. I also believe there
should be a limit to certain items. It just doesn't make sense that there
should be 70 mythical blades of total desctruction. It would be very cool if
a few items only have one copy. "I am X, Ranger of the 30th season, holder

The thing is, I believe a tradeskill should be to trade with, not just to
supply yourself with something you need. And a plat sink reduces the overall
economic might on a server. I want every one to buy a buy from me, because I
want to buy that super horse and that super armor. I don't feel a terrible
need to go quest for ry'gorr battlemail when I can just buy it. As such I
want another way of obtaining plat, other than looting or selling looted
items.
