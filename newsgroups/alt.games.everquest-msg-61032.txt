  Well, 1500pp per DROP is not underheard of.  Of course, some mobs are
ultra-rare so you won't be getting their drop very often, and for some mobs
the drop itself is ultra rare.  In some cases, the mob and the drops are
both rare.

  1500pp per SPAWN, on the other hand, is ridiculous, unless you're talking
a rare mob or a boss encounter.
