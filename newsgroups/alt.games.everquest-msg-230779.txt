And battle clerics.  Its a key stat for clerics between 56 and 60 
(between 50 and 60 on Firiona Vie) and a decent one for them on up to 
65.  Hammer procs are vastly more important than actual melee damage, 
and dex has a very marked effect on proc rates (Dex in huge chunks that 
is, the piddly 30 points you could get by plunking all creation points 
into dex wouldnt' be noticable)

Of course battle cleric means solo cleric or cleric with lots of mana 
regen and a slower in the group, but generally anywhere where you might 
think of nuking it makes more sense to wade in with the hammer swinging, 
If you can get your dex up over 200 for a high proc rate.
