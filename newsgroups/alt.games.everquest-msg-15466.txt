To clarify: if he's going up against a mob with a spell effect known
to overwrite a certain buff, have someone toss a low level version of
that buff on him as his first buff. When the mob casts on him, the mob
spell overwrites the buff and ends up in the first slot regardless of
how many songs he is singing, ready to be pumiced away.
