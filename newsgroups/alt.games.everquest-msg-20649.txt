Agreed.

But at the same time, some of the names that I feel add
color and wit to the game would be gone as well, and it would
be a more drab place.

I wish there were some objective, universally agreed upon
standard for "good" names versus "bad" names.  But since
there's not, there will always be arguments between players
about what name might add to the game, or take away from it.

I remember one such argument on the official EQ forums,
back when they existed.  Someone complained that his wife's
character, "Managirl Beachbum" (she hung out in desert zones
a lot), had her name forcibly changed for allegedly being
against the rules.  Even aside from the debate over whether
it actually *was* a violation of the rules (that answer
is *still* not really clear, due to ambiguities in the
rules), there were roughly evenly divided camps over the
issue of whether the name was too stupid to allow, or
colorful and fitting enough to add fun to the game world.

Aside from the issue of wildly offensive names, my usual
approach is to figure that even if a name makes *me* roll
my eyes, there are surely other people who enjoy it, and
certainly the person who chose the name is enjoying it,
so I'm not going to rain on their parade just to assuage
my own little irritation.

Often people will justify frequent name petitioning by
saying something like, "those people aren't the only
ones playing this game, their own fun isn't the only
thing that matters here", to which my natural reaction
is, "well, that works both ways, doesn't it?"

My, this dead horse certainly looks beaten enough,
doesn't it?
