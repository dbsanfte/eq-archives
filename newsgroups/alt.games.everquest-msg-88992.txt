Yes, the wedding was held in /shout, but I didn't know at first as I
normally keep the shout channel off.

Freeman, I agree Crushbone is not a very good place to P/L people.  Maybe I
was misunderstood, I wasn't there P/L ing people, I was just bored, and
running around helping whoever was in need.  You know, healing the wounded,
buffing the tanks, retreiving corpses out of Throne Room for people, that
sort of thing.  I may not be the most sword proof little wolf at 25, but I
like to help if I can...Sometimes, the guild will set up "Aid Stations"
around lower level areas and give free buffs, binds, sows...and the like.
It makes the game more fun for me when I get to help people out at times.

And yes, I found it comical that the little guy disappeared when I turned
/roleplay off...
