    The programmers took a sloppy little shortcut when doing AA's. The check
for "can this person spend points in Archetype" is "do they have 6 points in
general". The check for "can this person spend points in Class" is "do they
have 12 points in Archetype", not "do they have 6 in general and 12 in
archetype". The refunds highlighted this little difference. ;-)
