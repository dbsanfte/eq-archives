Okay just opened up a second account this weekend, and was wondering
how others setup thier main account (the healer)?
I have some buttons that make me 'stand/target <alt>/cast #/sit'.  I
have one of these buttons for small heals, big heals, and thorns (I'm
using my 51 druid).  This way I just click on one of 3 buttons to keep
the main buffs fresh while medding constantly.  Is this the norm, is
there an easier way???

Now for locations and techniques, I am working on a bard right now by
pulling 4/8 MOB's and using AOE spells and then let the damage shield
finish then off.  In PC this works great since the fungus fiends don't
run, after 25 this will slow down so I was thinking of heading to CC
and pulling with druid and letting bard kill singles (Orcs).  Any
better locations with non-runners? Looking to get bard to mid 30's
then spend time learning the class when I have a lot of the usefull
spells (AOE mezz, single mezz, charm).

For those that don't like PLing, I don't plan on getting anyone killed
while learning the class and I read a lot of the boards (EQDiva,
monkly-business, adn here) so I have an idea on what each class can
do.

Thanks for input.
