Hi all,

I've been trying to make Fish Fillets with my newly acquired spit, some
fish, and some sauces. However, the spit Combine is telling me that I can't
mix items of that type in there... Do I have to do something to the fish
before I can use it? I'm use the fish caught in Surefell, and was wondering
if perhaps they were the wrong type? They also don't seem to want to combine
with bat wings to make the Fish Rolls.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Goo, while Edible, is far from
palatable!
