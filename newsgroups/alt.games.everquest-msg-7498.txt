Now I'm confused if we mean the same thing. I do not mean the message 'Your
casting is interrupted' when you just fail anywhere, standing around, not
in a fight. That might be channeling.
What I meant is: I cast a spell with some longer casting time (example:
gate) and get struck by a mob. Will spells *always* fail when a mob
lands a hit that damages you, or is there a chance that it still succeeds?
If so, depending on what? If it always fails, gate fleeing seems pointless
to me.
