Ok breaking it down;

Contrasting casters (wizzy, druid, non-dot spells) vs melee (War, SK,
etc). Again we thought this influx of weapons and armor was the
balance SoE had promised melee and most were damn glad to see it.

In a group situation, since the problem of agro control has not been
addressed, manna is not the issue. A wizzy with agro is dead, so that
limits the damage he can deal hence the amount of manna you need. All
along the problem is and remains agro.

Next the amount of damage done by melee has gone up a great deal since
the pop release, this affects mostly melee at 50 and above but thats a
HUGE jump. Spell damage in the 50-60 range has changed little and
thats critical. There is no "windblade" for casters. Focus effects are
very pitiful compared to these new weapons.

Resists in LDoN reflect a change toward melee friendly further
reducing caster damage. Agro from resists is still screwy and that
remains a mystery. 

Simply put my SK at 59 or War at 58 with 3 levels of hastes (mostly
around the 70% range) and wearing only bazaar gear far outdamage my
wizard at 59 also. The SK is far better at agro control than the war
of course but this is old news.

Now to point to KEI which adds no damage only allows manna regen
compared to easily 70% more damage from haste and great weapons to
boot is biased to say the least. Personly I cant see what the beef is
from the melee side, things have been great for them. Now this change
is just gravy....meanwhile wheres the windblade for casters?

Now solo is different but that was not the issue, KEI aids solo
greatly.
