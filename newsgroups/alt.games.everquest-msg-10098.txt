I agree, that EQ skills pseudo mimic RL by getting better with practice.
But how much fun in RL did you have brewing those first batches?  Probably a
heck of alot more then standing in the corner casting a spell on yourself
until you maxed out.

I think the mundaness of bringing up some skills could use some changes.
Maybe a quest where a caster finds a grand wizard deep in a dungeon that
teaches him their craft and their skill jumps 100pts, or a rogue that has to
pickpocket a government official for instance.

Some things in RL just don't translate well when applied to a game.
