Ive leveled more than 1 cleric to 60 or higher, im well aware of what spells
they posess =p

Also had a 60 wiz back in the old seb/acrylia AoE days - 2 clerics just
doesnt compare to ANY alternative PBAE casting class.

And sure, 2 clerics is an extra chance to survive a cleric death, but lets
face it.. when you pull 50 mobs, you either get smoked, or you totally smoke
the mobs.  Theres very little room in between for alternative endings =p
