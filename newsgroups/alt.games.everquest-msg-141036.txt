OIC.  I've never camped for XP in either of the Sol's, so I don't know the
zone.  Shame on me for thinking the warrior didn't know where he was.  =)

Heheheh, yeah, and we don't often get to feel that way.

I experienced something similar in SolA during the first rez, when somone
trained the zone with six goblins.  So I cast DA, sat down, mem'd Upheval,
stood up, and nuked them out of existence.  This got a "Wow" from one of the
other guys hanging around the zone line.  Not often a cleric gets to hear
"wow" for dealing damage.  ^_^

Hmm.  I was within range, I was just getting resist after resist.  I just
must have been very unlucky.

Hehehe, happens to me all the time, too.

D'oh.  So much for my plans to go back there and farm it for myself.

Hehehe.  Not this time.  Mostly because the raid leader was prodding at us
to hurry with the buffs.  Also, I was mildly spamming the channel with how
much mana I had and how much mana it took to cast BoA, so folks were getting
the idea that this wasn't something I could cast casually.

Heh, well, that's been pretty much the norm on every open raid I've gone on:
list-style rolling.  I only ever random by person in groups.  That's how I
got my FT3 boots earlier that day.

As an aside, for some inexplicable reason, the norm on Drinal for rolling is
/random 200 500.  I have no idea where those numbers came from, but at every
high-end camp when it's time to roll, it's 200-500.

As a further aside, for weeks and weeks I'd been rolling very badly on item
drops.  Then, in the last couple of weeks, I've rolled a 498 on an Obulus
Death Shroud and a 439 for the FT3 boots from CT.  I guess I was just saving
up my luck for the really good stuff.  =)

Oooh... that would get my blood boiling...someone rolling for an item they
intend to sell when there are many others that can use it.

Oh my goodness... I would /report that right away.  Don't confirmation boxes
say who's offering the TL?  If they don't, the should, to prevent this kind
of behavior.

Gah, it gets me mad when people resort to tricks like.  Glad that wizzie was
able to overcome it.

Ah.  Plus aggro seems to be a much bigger problem - both raids I was on when
I was 52 failed because someone got Vox aggro.

I probably will skip Vox, just because I imagine it looks exactly the same,
except Vox is blue and shoots out blue fire rather than red.
