Below some certain level: no penalty at all, so you don't even need to
offload equipment.

Then there is one level where there is no XP loss, but equipment stays on
the corpse.  At that level, you can do what you suggest, offloading
everything at the bank, and picking it up at the bank near your respawn
point.

After that, there is some XP loss.

Note that because the XP loss starts one level after you stop respawning
with equipment, you can't delevel down to the keep-your-equipment range.  I
didn't realize this till I tried to delevel my level 11 Rogue.  He's mostly
for exploring and corpse recovery, and I realized it would be much more
convenient for him if he kept his equipment.  I was quite annoyed when I got
down to 10, and found that it wasn't far enough, and I couldn't go farther!

Buy Planes of Power.  Then, going from Freeport to Rivervale is simply a
matter of clicking on the book in Freeport to get to PoK, running over to
the Rivervale book, and clicking on it, which actually takes you to Misty
Thicket, and then taking the short run to Rivervale.

The only people I can think of who might not find Planes of Power worthwhile
are those who are possibly done with EQ (e.g., I've been mostly playing DAoC
recently...only going to EQ to do things with my guild, and I'm a Wizard,
and so PoP was *almost* not worth it for me).
