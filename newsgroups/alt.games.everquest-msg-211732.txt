What recharge?  We are talking xp group, you should be going pretty well 
nonstop.

When that red mob pops, the knight grabs aggro, NOW, I slow, and everyone 
is happy.

In order to take damage, said tank needs to be able to hold aggro.  
Warriors are inferior at that to knight classes.  In xp groups, people 
don't generally go after mobs that are very red to them.  I certainly 
will not dispute that a warrior can soak damage better than a knight, 
however, with a knight, the mob can be slowed before it hits anyone, with 
a warrior, I tend to have to wait a bit while the warrior establishes 
aggro.  The mobs I take on in xp groups, if a resisted slow means I get 
aggro, it also means that I can very easily end up dead.  This slows down 
the group quite significantly.  If I wait to slow, that means that the 
warrior is fighting an unslowed mob for a while, this means he takes more 
damage.

For raid level mobs that require the defensive discipline, there is no 
question at all, a warrior is required, for any other situation, a knight 
can step in, and, in an xp group, said knight will be better than a 
warrior, all else being equal.
