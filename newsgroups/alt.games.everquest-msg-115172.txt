I'd go along with that, I give them away (killed a lot of Sambata doing
Twilight Seas Quest)
Also from Dawn Shroud the Sambata Tribal Advisor drops a very nice 1hb 13/25
+4 wis (Intel's Hammer) that you might want to look out for later, should
sell for 500 - 700pp maybe less if you are lucky, it's priest class only,
Cleric, Druid, Shaman and Beastlord so the ratio is wasted on all but the
Beastlord.
The advisor might not be spawning atm as he was bugged after the last patch,
used to be a 42nd Cleric turned into a Male Erudite who was a 55+ (red to
52) Necro...At least he was on BB, I petitioned and reported the bug, next
day he didn't spawn at all so I think they took him off the spawn table
until they fix him.
