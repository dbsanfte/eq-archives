If you chose the Shadow Knight you're in for the long haul - In my 
experience the SK is somewhat underpowered until lvl 30, where the class 
starts to shine and come into its own. Until then its part warrior and part 
necro without excelling in either - and hard work getting exp. Depending on 
the race, theres a lot of quests which makes the levels fly by.

Ive played a number of SK's; Troll, Iksar and DE - And I stuck with the DE.
As far as it goes I find that race the most 'SK-ish' - Don't ask me why :-)

The race-issue can either be heavily debated or skipped rather quickly - I 
chose the last one when I rolled my figures, and went with the gut feeling.

Only racial issue is regeneration, which as far as I'm concerned is of 
little or no importance - It never saved my hide, and only cut downtime on 
a few occations. Others might be of a different oppinion - they are right 
too.

For a full overwiew, visit shadowknight.org for more info and pointers.

When compared to the BST, I find it a much more rewarding class to play - as 
well as more suited for my roleplaying.

The beastlord never did the trick for me, and although I tried different 
races and styles, I felt it like one long exp grind. Soloing came easy when 
in the low teens and early twenties, but then it became more and more 
difficult to get groups for better exp. I eventually cancelled when it 
became too booring.

Have fun with your new character !
