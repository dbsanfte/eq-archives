Well yes and no.  As I said before, the reason the ranger or monk shouldn't
be pulling was not that I had any special skills as regards those areas, but
rather that the object was for me to keep aggro as much as possible.  Since
untwinked rangers and monks are basically about as good at mitigating damage
as so many paper dolls, it would make sense for -any- MA class to do the
pulling.

Monks are great pullers when you want to bring mobs in one at a time; they
can use FD to split, and when they get back to the group, can FD again to
dump aggro to the designated MA.  Level 20ish monks, though, tend to have
exceptionally poor FD skill levels, and very likely fairly poor FD skill (the
player, not the character, this time)... so what you see with a lowbie monk
puller is a damage dealer getting gobs of mobs and then requiring massive
healing to stay alive.

Rangers make excellent pullers outdoors in wide open places, where -finding-
a mob, particularly one of the level range you want, getting to him fast, and
getting him back to the group alone are important skills.  Harmony also
allows them to do some very impressive splitting of static camps... outdoors,
though, unless they changed that, and do they even -have- that spell in the
low 20s?  Indoors at a static camp, they don't strike me as any better than
any other class for the job... and due again to their light armor and low HP
totals, the pinata effect is back in place.

Realistically, looking for the individual with the highest HP total, with
consideration to AC, mitigation skills, and (my recent discovery) HP regen
rates seems to me a more sensible way to select a puller than relying on
cookie cutter roles that apply better to level 50+ characters anyway.   The
ranger was puller till his HP buff dropped, then we went with my shaman, to
discover that my regen rate was definately a plus.
