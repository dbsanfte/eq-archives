Your insistence on qualifying everything's importance, with no real
authority to do so. Some may consider restricting whatever we put
into our own bodies the most heinous restriction of all.

Wrong. The law claims to be able to hang me for treason too, but I'd
like to see them try it. It is also illegal to try a bit of 'chocolate
loving' with a female partner, but you don't honestly think we're bound
by that. Indeed, one of our strongest qualities here, I think, is the
relentless critisism and scorn we pour on our political system, which
ensures the government never goes unwatched - it cannot get away with
*anything*. 

If you must focus on the fact that our secrets are 'official' and
yours aren't, fine. But you are subject to official secrets too - 
they just aren't very upfront about it. The real issue is how well
the media is actually controlled, and I think you win there too.

**********
Voice of America, a federally supported international broadcasting
organization, decided not to air a story that included parts of a rare
interview with the leader of Afghanistan's ruling Taleban, Mullah
Mohammed Omar, officials said. The decision came after Deputy Secretary
of State Richard Armitage and senior National Security Council officials
told the organization's governors that it would be tantamount to
granting a platform to terrorists. The governors then told employees to
kill the story. 

The Taleban had offered the organization an opportunity to interview Mr.
Omar, which was done before the governors' orders. 

"I was stunned, absolutely stunned," said an agency journalist who asked
not to be named. "It goes against every principle of journalistic
ethics." 

� "Taleban Interview Suppressed", International Herald Tribune,
2001-09-24, p.6. **********

So there you go. This would not have happened here, because of
journalistic integrity. The OSA is a convenient angle for you, but is a
pretty worthless one. 

You must remember that we don't operate autonomously anymore. We are
part of the European Union, and as such are subject to all sorts of
additional precedents and so on. I would be very surprised if the OSA
was considered more powerful than the Court of Human Rights.

Remember that bit about the OSA which was posted here? The one about the
D notice? This line was curiously removed before posting...

"Currently, the forbidden subject is any discussion of possible foul
play in the death of Princess Diana and her intended husband Dodi Fayed.
" 

That was a successful day for the OSA then, because this was NEVER
reported in the press. Oh no. Not once :P .

Yes, but it has been described *badly*, and it's power is, I think,
massively overestimated.

What "latest gun control law"? Gun control has been off
the agenda here for years. Generally speaking, they are illegal weapons 
not owned by the public and have been for a long time. 

No, the violent crime rise (which has been VASTLY hyped up by the Daily
Mail, Times etc.) has other factors (which I won't get into here),
including smuggled guns. I don't see how making it easier to own a gun
will help this - indeed, in the UK, the only people who *want* guns are
criminals - why allow them to buy them in the street?

No, you'll just start it and run for cover.
