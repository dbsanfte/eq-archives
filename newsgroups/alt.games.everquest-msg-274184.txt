No, that's not quite what I meant.   I had pieced together the story from 
several posts in the thread when I first read it and it turns out I had some 
of the sequence of events completely backward (hey, I had read it in 
December - I'm surprised I even remembered it at all).  I did, however, 
manage to find the thread that I was referring to.  If you're at all 
interested in the clarification, including the short one-liner SOE response, 
head here.

The main point I was going after, though, is that if you read through that 
thread you will see that some consider that to be justified roleplaying. 
Others consider it to be griefing.  No idea what, if any, action SOE took as 
by policy they won't state any such actions.  But the mod response was that 
such action should be reported.
