When the world was young, we had a Barbarian shaman that would pull Woolly
Mammoths to the newbie area in Everfrost Peaks, then start yelling for help.
Once the low-level would-be benefactors enganged the beast, the shaman would
run off.

Someone once told me that you could not start a train in Mistmoore by
attacking the pet that stuck out of the wall at the top of the zone ramp.  I
proved him wrong by casting an AoE spell on it... cleared the dungeon.
