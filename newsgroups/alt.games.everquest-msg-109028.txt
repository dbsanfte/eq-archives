All depends on what you mean by fun?
Do you want to go on raids and be useful and be doing
something all the time. Then I suggest these classes:

Warrior
Enchanter
Cleric
Shaman
Monk
Rogue

All these classes have essential roles to play on raids.

Personally I like to play the Monk. You get to be the puller a lot.
Picking and chosing what to fight and when, Splitting the pulls is fun.
Bard is cool to becuse you are always doing something during the
fight or downtime you are always busy.

Sure if you like to solo a lot. =)

If you want to solo try these:

Necromancer
Mage
Wizard
Beastlord
Shadow Knight
(Druid you already know)

But by and large soloing is pretty boring no matter the class.

If you are bored hunt different things and go different places.
