I don't think it is as dire a picture as you paint it.

DoAC has a much more efficient graphics engine than EQ (post EQ:SoL),
and runs fine on mid-level machines. The reason this is possible is
that the graphics engine in DAoC is newer, more efficient, and takes
advantage of the features built into the current crop of video cards.

EQ started development years before it was released. The EQ graphics
engine was built when 3dfx was king of the hill (it supported Glide).
EQ is now 3+ years old. VI has beefed the engine up and bolted on new
features, but it is still the same engine. The excessively high
hardware requiements to play EQ post SoL are a clear indication of
this. The engine is not efficient. The engine is drawing many times
more polygons using the same basic code. That is why it takes so much
horsepower (CPU, RAM, Video RAM).

EQ2 will have a completely new graphics engine. It will be more
advanced and much more efficient.
