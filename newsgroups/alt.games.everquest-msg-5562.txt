Agil does help your armor class, but being a non-melee class, you're
looking at something like a 5 agil to 1 ac ratio... In other words,
you probably can't raise your AC enough through Agil to make it worth
the effort involved.  And dex does increase proc rate... on the
grounds of 200 Dex per every .5% chance.

And there will be those that tell you Dex also affects your chancesat
casting spells through hits.  This is patently untrue, it's a
combination of the level of the spell, and your own channeling skill. 

Offhand, I'd suggest carrying a few bits of STR equipment to help you
haul around your loot, and perhaps peicing together a Charisma suit
for when you've got to buy large amounts of items from vendors, such
as training in your trade skills.  Otherwise, all stats other than
what you depend on for mana are pretty much a wash.
