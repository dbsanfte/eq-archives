Pets are just like characters, procs that are level limited require them to be
at least that level to get the proc to work.  Problem is, your pet isn't your
level, so it can be hard to figure out what level your pet is... and even
knowing that, the game doesn't tell you what level items proc at.

Short answer, then, is "I don't know".  What level is your pet?  And what
specific item are you looking at?  The Sword of Runes procs a anti summoned DD
and works on the pets my mage summons at 29, I wager the pet you summon at 39
can proc those...
