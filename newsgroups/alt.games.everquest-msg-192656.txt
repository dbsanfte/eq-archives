Dakthin;

Thank you for your response.  Prior to posting this question, I did do just
that. However, I could not find answers adequate enough. I found several
postings in forums and web pages referencing mana and wisdom items. But I
didn't  not find out the how's or why's of mana/wisdom like the question I
posted here.  Generally when I have a question I do, do the research. It's
only when I can't find the answer that I post here. I'm usually to impatient
to post and wait for answer so that's my last resort.

Oh and Thanks for the link. I didn't have that one.

Thanks again and Take Care
