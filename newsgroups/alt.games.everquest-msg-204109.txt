Sebilis is the only other one I can think of off hand that has a reasonable 
chance of having people in it.  On EMarr at least, Howling Stones, Kaesora, 
Chardok are all pretty well abandoned, strictly BYOG places.  Part of the 
problem is that at 53 you are probably of a level to hit PoJ, and so are 
all the others at your level, and, the ZEM brings people to pop zones.
