Yes, there is.  You may have to turn log files on; I have mine turned on
by default, which you can do by editing eqclient.ini in your EverQuest
folder and setting Log=true in the [Defaults] section.  That will also
generate log files for all your characters, which means you'll want to
go in and clean out those files occasionally.  (I scrape them for lots
of stuff, including non-Bazaar purchases and sales.)

The log file for a trader is in the Logs folder inside your EverQuest
folder, and is named bzrlog_<server>_<character>.txt.

The log file for a buyer (barterer) is btrlog_<server>_<character>.txt.

Another potentially useful file is in the EverQuest folder (not in the
Logs sub-folder), called BZR_<character>_<server>.ini.  It contains the
prices you've set on your trader, in copper pieces.  And if you want to
get a list of what's on your trader, you can use the /outputfile command
to write out your entire inventory to a file.
