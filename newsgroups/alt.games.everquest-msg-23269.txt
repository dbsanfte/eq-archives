Wait, I've found the problem, it's bad translation.

On page 34 of his EQ manual it clearly (in French) states:

"If something goes wrong, post an all-caps curse-fest post to the EQ 
newsgroup.  The newsgroupers are secretly employed as tech support for 
Verant, and they will fix the problem for you.  If they don't, continue 
to complain to them until they do something about it."
