Between a full group and solo lies partnerships, trios,
and partial groups.

Particularly attractive are partnerships; for a pet class, this hardly
costs any exp at all, as unless mana is burned in substantial
quantities that pet will eat half the exp solo, while only 1%
grouped.  Burning enough mana to get the kill slows things
down, so that costs exp too.

Even without the pet dimension, a partner is far more likely
to more than double your kills per hour than a group of
six is to more than sextuple it.

Trios are a little shakier, now you need to do better than
three times as many kills.. still likely, but are you beating
the ratio a pair would be getting?  Only if its a well built
trio.

Over three you are almost bound to see the ratio of
kills per hour per person decline, unless you have a
well built group and are taking out stuff so strong
that the smaller groups would be just bashing their
heads against the wall.
