That's a self-contradiction. Rewarding grouping always has been, and will
always be, seen by soloers as penalizing soloers.

I've even heard questions like: "Why should I be penalized for only being
able to play the game one hour per day?"

People will scream and scream to persuade SoE to make the game easier and
more solo-friendly until it's no longer worth spending time on, it seems.
