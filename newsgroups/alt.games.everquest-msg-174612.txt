There's an xp modifier in *every* zone. (It's called the Zone Experience
Modifier or ZEM.) However, some are much better than others. ;-)

For example, the ZEM in the newbie zones is insanely high. You just
can't benefit from it after a few levels go by.  Some old world zones
had their's increased to make them more desirable (e.g. The Hole). Later
expansion zones had some that apparently also had some very desirable
ZEMs. Paludal caverns is famous for having an insanely high one.
Dawnshroud may as well, though I never really hunted there.
