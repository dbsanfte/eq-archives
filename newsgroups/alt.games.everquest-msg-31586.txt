Neither do I. I am merely replying to: "Of course it's a problem, if 
those who create the rules are not bound by them." It's not a question 
of legality. It's a question of rules. Verant makes those rules. Verant 
can bend those rules or outright break them if they want. No, as a 
private company they are NOT bound to be bound by the rules THEY create. 
You, on the other hand, ARE bound by them when you click the accept 
button. It's that simple. 

The thread started when Lokari petitioned a name that was NOT adhering 
to the rules. The rules that Verant created and you, and I, and everyone 
else on the server accepted when we clicked that button. Pissing and 
moaning about getting caught (or someone turning them in) and POSSIBLY 
having their name changed is, in my opinion, stupid for the simple fact 
that it IS against the rules. Why should "Wantsomedrinks" be allowed to 
have a name that is clearly against those rules? Did he/she pay more 
than that $9.95 per month to get that preferred treatment? 

It obviously bothered her enough to /petition and wait long enough for a 
GM response. So why would ANYONE have the stones to say that she was 
wrong for doing that?? I hear a bunch of sympathy for someone stupid 
enough to break the rules.... I find that quite.... pathetic.
