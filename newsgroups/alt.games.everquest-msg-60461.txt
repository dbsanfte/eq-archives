Hello all, long time reader-first time poster.
Got a technical problem that *SOMEBODY'S* got to know the
answer to. I just recently upgraded from 56k to @Home cable
yesterday and all applications/games, i.e Netscape, Forte Agent, 
Counterstrike, etc work fantastic. Except for Everquest.
I had heard there were some broadband problems from in-game
/ooc's when I played on a 56k modem but figured that most problems
were probably figured out by now assuming that EQ gaming is HUGE
and broadband connections are not just a niche. Anyhow, I can
get all the way into the game up to the character selection screen
just fine, (chat just fine as well), but as soon as I select a
character it takes 2-3 times longer than with 56k to get in game
and then I get MASSIVE packetloss - around 95+ percent and most
of the times go LD soon after. Sometimes when I dont go LD, I can
move around, but cant interact with environment (i.e open doors, etc)
but I cant do much of anything else. I went into chat and one GM said
to contact my Cable ISP and ask about ports being opened...I missed
all the details on that tell so I went to do a Google search and went
thru countless web pages searching for anything with "cable modem" and

"everquest" in it and then did the same with Dejanews usenet archives.
No solution found, but rather ALOT of people asking the very same 
question. A few posts said to download Speedguide.net speed tweaks 
and I did, but problem still exists. Some posts ask if you are running
a firewall, in my case, no not yet anyways, just got the cable modem 
in yesterday. Everquest.com broadband tips were completely useless as
well. I play on brell serilis so I did a trace route to it and was
consistently hitting 15-16 hops with no timeouts. Traced
chat.everquest.com and a few other servers just for grins and giggles
and the same results came back. I'd very much appreciate if someone
had a solution (Im no networking guru by any means, but not afraid to
RTFM or any technical papers if I can at least find a solution
somewhere). Here is a list of my equipment:

Athlon 1.4
Geforce 3
256mb Ram
3com external usb/ethernet Homeconnect cable modem
(currently hooked up to USB til I figure out the proper	ethernet setup

to my switch)
