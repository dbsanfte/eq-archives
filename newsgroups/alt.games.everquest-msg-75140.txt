I'd think Tower of Frozen Shadow would do nicely if you can assemble a
group.  It is not only a good zone for your level on the ground floor, but
it is full of undead.  The lesser shades can drop scythes that sell for
about 11 plat each.  To my mind ToFS is one of the most interesting and
unique zones in terms of style and backstory, and that definitely helps
build atmosphere and dispel monotony.

My second suggestion might be Dalnir's.  Or if you are too low to go inside
yet, you could beat up on the 5 brutes that spawn in the cave system that
leads to Dalnir's.  The crypt itself may be the best loot haul you'll find
at 30, but you should plan to bring your own group if you do this one.  It's
a bit out of the way of things to hope for a pickup group.  If worse comes
to worst, though, you could possibly try to recruit a pickup group from the
nearby Overthere and lead them back to the Crypt.  I never went that route,
though, and I wouldn't bet on it's working very well.

Third choice would be back in Velious.  Crystal Caverns.  RyGorr Miners
might work out for you if you find a partner.  Just keep in mind, nobody can
bind in that zone and melee types' closest bind point is (I think) Kael
Drakkal.  Not such a long run from the caverns, but you will probably need
invis to get in.  I always used it.  Also, running to zone from an overpull
in this particular dungeon may get you out of the frying pan and into the
fire, as the snowball you zone through is in the RyGorr fortress.  If you
can keep invis up long enough and have someone show you the way, I would
reccommend that you go on into the Coldain town deeper in the Caverns.  If
you do that, then you can always bring an overpull to the guards if you can
make it -- the Rygorr run fast and hit fairly hard.

Hope one of these suits you.  Good hunting!
