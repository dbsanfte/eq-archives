The problem is that unlike PvPers who -want- to all lump together on a 
special rules server, people who buy/sell items are and will continue to 
be spread over all servers.

SOE has 0 credibility that it will remain isolated servers. Again, 
unlike PvP, station exchage is a direct revenue stream.

The *don't* need to enforce it in the courts. They reserve the right to 
refuse service. Period. They can permanently ban you from playing the 
game for breaking practically any rule of the game they deem fit to 
think up.

To combat IGE they would simply have needed to aggressively ban accounts 
buyers and sellers both. There is *NO* legal recourse to that. And once 
word got out that SOE is aggressively banning you if they catch you the 
activity would drop to a comparative underground trickle. The number of 
buyers would drop substantially fewer would deem it worth the risk. And 
sellers would be forced underground... as soon as any seller got high 
profile enough to actually be making significant money then targetting 
and banning his accounts would be fairly trivial.

No legal fees. No courts. No mention of the EULA. There is nothing to 
sue about. You can't sue for being kicked out of the game.

If they were going to do it, they'd have already done it. They only way 
they'll go about it now is through competition... which means station 
exchange is coming to a server near you... well... your server actually. 
Either way that's increased game item activity. If -they- ignore IGE the 
activity will still increase, becuase before honest players were 
deterred by the 'its outright detrimental to the game' stance... now 
they are supposed to be deterred by "its only ok if you pay us 
stance'... and that's a MUCH weaker deterrent.
