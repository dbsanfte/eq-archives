}>So I wanted to pose the question, what is the HARDEST to play and why?
}For me I would say:

That's key, right there.  What's easiest/hardest to play is a very 
individual, personal question.

}1)  Bard, because of the constant song twisting.

I'd agree that bard is hard.  It's nothing to do with the twisting, 
though.  It's that there's about a million ways to do bard-job, which 
makes it hard to pick the best one at the spur of the moment.  Countless 
are the times I've been a-barding, and realized this would be -simple- if 
I'd just thought to mem song X, but it isn't up, so... I die. :)

}2)  Enchanter because they are also having to do lots of stuff (mezz,
}stun, charm, root, etc., depending on the situation), plus from what I
}understand they die a lot (mobs seem to really get mad at the
}enchanter for mezzing them for some reason!).

Enchanter is to me, the absolute easiest class to play.  Largely, because 
I've played enchanter more than anything else and know it very well.  
Control the crowd, get everything tashed and slowed, throw some extra 
debuffs if I'm in the mood, maybe nuke a little, swap half my spell set 
and still have time to re-KEI some poor sap who just got rezzed and 
twiddle my thumbs for a couple seconds before it's time to refresh mezzes.  
No problem.  And dying?  Dying is easy!  Just fall over dead, go get a 
soda, and come back and click the rez confirmation box.

}3)  Cleric--some people seem to think clerics just do nothing but
}heal/med/rez but sometimes they actually have to sort of "play God",
}when a fight goes bad, when they are low mana and can't heal everyone
}in the group and have to decide who lives and who dies at the spur of
}the moment. (and a cleric can't really AFK too much, they have to pay
}attention to everyone's health bars constantly)

I've never found it difficult to play god.  Playing a cleric isn't much 
fun for me though, and that alone makes it difficult.  I get bored and my 
attention wanders.  For me healers are tougher than anything else.  And 
the absolute hardest class for me to play?

Druid.

Seriously.

I just full-bore, flat-out -suck- at druiding.

Go figure.

So, my druid's the level 11 bazaar mule. :)

I borrowed someone else's 64 druid, and sure, I could quad kite.  But the 
whole time, I was thinking to myself... This would be -so- much simpler 
with a wizard...  Took her on a raid and felt more lost about what to do 
to make myself useful than with any other character.
