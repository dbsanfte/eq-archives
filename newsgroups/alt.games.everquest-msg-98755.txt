My apologies. That was probably confusing since I neglected to put an
emoticon on it. I was kidding.  To clear up any confusion for our up and
coming melee types, I offer the following:

Ripose, in and of itself, is not a discipline. It's a skill that
warriors get at level 25. You don't/can't make a hot key for it, as it's
one of those things that just randomly goes off when it wants to. (Even
with the skill maxed out at 225 it's still fairly rare, but nice when it
happens. Or, it can happen at inopportune times and embarass you. ;-)
[1]*)

The disciplines only happen when you invoke them. You can type in /disc
disciplinename_01 or make a hotkey to do them, assuming they are
available. There is no "riposte" discipline by name, but at 56 warriors
do get the discipline of the Furious. (/disc furious). That one will
give you a nine second window where you will riposte every single attack
made on you, but can only be used once every hour of real time.  To find
out if you are ready to use one, you can just type in /disc and it will
give you a list of valid disciplines and tell you either that you are
ready to use one now, or how many minutes you have until you will be
able to use one again. I keep a hotkey on bank ten for that so I can
safely check my /disc timer before starting a big mob encounter. You can
see a list of all the warrior disciplines here, with detailed
descriptions of each:
http://eq.castersrealm.com/disciplines/list.asp?Class=Warrior

I assume the previous poster just made a typo with the "55 plus riposte
tanks" and meant 56.  However, given that you only get nine seconds of
riposte, your class defining 55 disc of Defensive is still going to
usually be your best bet except for very specific mobs. (VS is one where
it's suggested, though I'm still not sure if that's the best bet.)

Hope that helps clear up the Riposte/Discipline stuff.

[1]*  Semi-funny story about riposte. We were setting up for an attack
on Ixiblat Fer for Tiru's epic. Somebody had pulled the quest mob over
to the SF zone, as usual, then zoned. However, we had some LD's and a
few people still on the way in, and had to wait a bit. We found out that
hailing her does *NOT* stop her from wandering back to her spawn point
out in the forrest. Getting tired of screwing around, I walked up an
just Slammed her once for a few points of damage to get on her hate
list. Then I stood there. Seeing her success rate in attacking me, it
looked like I could just stand there and let her beat on me for a good
five minutes without even needing a heal of any sort. Figuring this
would keep the quest mob amused while we waited for the rest of our
raiders, I took the opportunity to wander away from keyboard to take a
bathroom break and grab a drink before the fight started. I came back to
find the cleric screaming that I was "killing the quest mob". I had
riposted her down below half health. DOH!

I then turned my back on her and stopped riposting and was able to let
her keep beating on me until we were ready to trigger Ixblot.

Live and learn.
