I'm 18, been playing EQ since the beginning of December 1999. My highest
character (listed below) was created in late February 2000, and has almost
75 days of /played time.

Other than that, I've played a Mage to 5, Cleric to 14, Warrior to 27,
another Warrior to 21, a Necro to 12, a Monk to 8, another Warrior to 33,
another monk to 21, another Warrior to 39, another Cleric to 6, and another
Monk to 7. Let me tell ya .. DON'T delete old characters unless you have to
make room for a new one! Every time I start a new alt, I regret having
deleted the previous one of its class. =)
