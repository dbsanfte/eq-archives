Amen and no dissn' intended.  I don't do the rabid searching for gear that 
I used to do before I put my EQ playing on hold, so I don't know what is 
out there to replace it.  Any sugestions on an eventual replacement?  My 
guild is relatively small, so we won't be taking down any targets that take 
4+ groups over 50, but, the KCoG does take down big targets now and then, 
and I attend these raids, so I'll make sure I'm on any that you recommend 
that drop goodies.
