Because we have no way to single pull out of camps, choosing
mobs/areas that are well spaced is the trick.

Just happened a month or so ago - if you want the exact
date, you can go to http://www.castersrealm.com and look
at the archived patch messages.

Heh, things get a bit easier higher up - Gift of Xev summons
up a weightless 10 slot bag with 20 food, 20 water and 20 
bandages :-P  Plus, I've tended to group more than solo, 
particularly post 50, so I don't armor my pets (but I do
summon more focus items)

I can't remember what level shadowed men are .....
are you in your low 30's?  If you're intent
on soloing, you can start taking Stoneleers,
the lower form of cactuses and Sarnak recruits
in OT.  You can usually single pull those, and
they all run slow enough to outrun them to
the zone if you get more than 1 (plus groups
are readily available there)>

Yup, I feel the same way, I love being able to go toe to
toe with things other classes have to make run away to
solo :)  However, as you progress you'll find that for
raw damage output in groups, there's nothing like a mage,
and grouping is by far more fun (IMO).
