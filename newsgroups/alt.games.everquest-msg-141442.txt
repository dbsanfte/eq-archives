Even if it were true, it DEFINATELY wouldn't be worth replacing those
rings. For a warrionr, HP is your first priority, AC a very close
second. To answer your main question, no, dex doesn't improve hit
accuracy. It will make your weapons proc more often, and it is said it
helps the frequency of critical hits...
