Cazic is excellent fun, good loot and Xp, but I found it really hard to
find a group. The number of times I had the zone to myself was quite
depressing. And if there was a group it was generally just pulling
lizards out of the maze.

Was there from 27 to 33 playing my rogue, and saw 0 drops of the 
ravenscale I lusted after :( That stuff is just insanely rare. And
now i'm beginning to think it's time to leave.

Might check out dalnirs though...dungeons are excellent practice
and xp grinding in OT is insanely dull.
