Thanks to all who answered my question.

I had the same suspicion.  My seven-year-old son used to have
a character named Twinkme.  I decided it would be uptight of
me to care about this, though.  I even suggested
Neverbeentwinked for a char he made this weekend.

Likely for your chars, maybe, but not his.  He makes about one
a week, and enjoys playing them up to about level four before
he deletes them to create another.  His most recent before this
weekend was a female barbarian warrior.  She is Amazonprincess.
Of course I created Amazonqween so we can play together.

<warning: thread drift coming>

A senior guide popped up and asked me to change Amazonqween
to something else, as titles are not allowed.  I do not mind at all,
as I want to play by the rules.  I think I will change mine to Faolan,
and his to Ingheanfhaolain.  Can a name be 15 characters long?  I
have only used as many as 14 so far.  It's not important, as I will
get the answer when I /petition.  If you do know, though, thanks
for letting me know.

[ I wonder what a guide would have thought of his old character
  'Lonestarlawman?'  No points for guessing the class.    :-)          ]
