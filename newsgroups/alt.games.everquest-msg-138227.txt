That would be nice, wouldn't it?  Not that I'm aware of, though. I was
looking also. You can just try a few random names that are intuitive,
however. On Xev there has been an #auction channel since the channels
went live. Of course, now that the bazaar has gone live, activity in it
seems to have fallen off *very* dramatically.

Most of the classes seem to have a channel set up by class name. They
may or may not be password protected, but you can likely get the
passwords easy enough by reading message boards at class specific web
sites.
