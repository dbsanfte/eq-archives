You'd be surprised.  Particularly if you are in a guild, you can then pop 
into your guild hall, and port back to Lavastorm, and go be ready for the 
next mission.  If you are not in a guild, then you zone back out to PoK, 
hit the Neriak book, and are back and read for a mission in a few 
minutes.  I've been on DoNs where I was the primary healer, and the only 
one with a rez of any type at all, my zero xp AA rez.
