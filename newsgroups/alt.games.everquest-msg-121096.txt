Sounds like you are getting bandwidth and packet altency confused. EQ will
run fine at 26.5, but to twist 4 bardsongs you need latency of under about
240 ms. Since I switched to cable, I can twist 4 bard songs. If your
connection is unstable, then dont try and play a solo class (or a critical
class like ench or cleric), else you will just LD and die constantly. Seems
a damage dealer in a group would suit you. Melee or perhaps mage. Maybe
shaman.
