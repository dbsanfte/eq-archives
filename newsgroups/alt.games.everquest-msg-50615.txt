Cant agree with you there. As a soloing druid (have root, dot and snare on
armor, but NOT using that), i use 6 spells slots when i camp Den Ironblend and
friends in BB. I even have Spirit of Cheeta memmed constantly now just to have
it ready when i have long runs.
Only have to mem if i port somewhere, decide to group (used 7 spell slots in TT
while grouping to get my Sebilis key, those 7 including Invis for avioding adds
while trying to track Forager down), or give other buffs.


I wil be more than happy with sets of spells, so i can have 1 travel set, 1
group set, 1 solo set, 1 port set, 1 buff set. But again, i can overcome
spending 1 min a day scribing spells, i spend more time telling the morons that
think that being a druid means i have to leave my camp, run to the other end of
BB and sow them, to go jump in a lake.
