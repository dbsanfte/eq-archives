Hmm, you know I've always felt that it worked an awful lot of the time.

Well, how about this little oddity.  After some time casting a spell, say
CHeal, its easy to see with some precision how much mana its going to
take to cast it.  When you run too LOM or even OOM and have to
med back up to that point, you'll find you have to med up more mana
than it will take to cast the spell before you are allowed to do so.
Then when you are finally alllowed to cast it, you use only the amount
you expected, so you have mana left over.

I've heard that this is because when the game checks to see if you have
sufficient mana, it does so without regards to your specialization.  This
would make sense if specialization was a "maybe it works" thing, even
if spec 200 meant it works 99.9% of the time.  But if Spec always works
then this "don't make no sense"
