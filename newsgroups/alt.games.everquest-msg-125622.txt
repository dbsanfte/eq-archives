Hey guys. I used to play a 31 wizard, but got angry one day, deleted all my
characters (after giving my stuff to a friend), and cancelled my account.

After realizing the error of my ways, I came back, not knowing which class
to play, wanting something different from my wizard. A friend suggested a
bard, and that is what I am playing. Currently, I'm level 11. I've completed
the newbie armor quest (Songweavers blue platemail, looks AWESOME), as well
as the sword that comes with it. I'm hunting in EC right now, 12 is going to
rock with the DD song.

So far I'm absolutely loving it. I've never played a melee class before, so
It's very fun. I don't think it would be as fun without the songs, however
thats just my opinion. Twisting songs during combat is fun too. I twist my
heal song with my self only haste song at this level, which has saved my ass
several times from poison and disease.

So, can anyone just give me a glimpse of what life is like for a bard in
later levels? Do they go on raids a lot? I remember with my wizard that I
LOVED having bards because of the group heal and the mana song that STACKED
with clarity (so wonderful....<tears>). I also know that other melees like
the haste and STR buffs granted by the bard. How does the rest of Norrath
hold bards?

Thanks!
