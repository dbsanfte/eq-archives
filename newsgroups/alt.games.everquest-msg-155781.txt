no no no... I didn't say I was not getting exp cause of packet loss...
I said I was wondering if the chance of packett loss would explain why
the bar seemed to be not moving. Say mob X gives 100 exp point on a
kill. I kill mob X and get 100 exp points server side, however with
packett loss my client only it only registers 25 cause of hight
packett loss....dunno, just a thought.
