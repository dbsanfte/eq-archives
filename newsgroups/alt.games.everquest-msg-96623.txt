No idea.

Yes. It took me two weeks to complete a set of DF in the old CT, and I
was the only one hunting the drops. Look for the "Ritualist" He always
drops a couple pieces and is on a timer. (At least he was in the old
CT)

Unless the drop rates have been increased with the changes, 3+ hours
per piece is about right I'm afraid. Unless you can get a couple of
strong groups and clear all the areas where the Crusaders can spawn it
will take a long time.
