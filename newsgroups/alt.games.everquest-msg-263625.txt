I think at least part of the complaint is that not only is it linked, 
but, you are told it is linked when you con one of the mobs.  There is no 
guesswork the first time you encounter them, you con them, you know what 
will be pulled, you have a really good idea, based on all the information 
presented, as to whether or not you can defeat them.  Mind you, I have 
not been in beta, my observations are strictly based on reading what 
people who have played beta have posted in various places.
