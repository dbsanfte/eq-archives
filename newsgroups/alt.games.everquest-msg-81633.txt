So now the question comes up:  Are you intentionally incorrect in hopes
of trolling, or do you actually believe that your interpretation of the
world around you is accurate?  No one who has been here for any length
of time could read your post with a straight face.  We all know the
history between Biz and Lok.  Your description of it is about as wrong
as you can get.  

If you are trolling then you have not done a very good job.  If you
genuinely believe what you posted seek help soon, if not for yourself
then for the sake of your neighbors and those innocent kids at the local
playground.  Don't wait until the black helicopters tell you to hurt
someone.
