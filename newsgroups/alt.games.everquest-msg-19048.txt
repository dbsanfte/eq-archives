I have been reading abit about it and it seems to be rather rare, the
guy who gave it to me said something about that he had found something
better, some orb or something, this book is obvious not within the
reach of a lvl 6 guy, if you have to camp Najena to get it :)

Another of my guys was given the shield of the slain unicorn, also a
rare drop and rather valuable, to bad i could not use it since it
requires that you can dual wield, and my barb war was only lvl 5
at the time.

/Regards Berth
