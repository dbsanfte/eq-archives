This made so much sense I decided to check out to see if they added the perk
to human and smaller types. For a halfelven paladin it still doesn't go.

I find my pali incredibly boring to play anyway. Was keeping up slash, bash,
and 1hb. Just got a nice 2hs weapon and thought I had time for it too.
Because it would take 2x as long to level bash and 2hs since it can't be
done at the same time I will park the character.

On the bright side I managed to pick up a GLS while testing.
