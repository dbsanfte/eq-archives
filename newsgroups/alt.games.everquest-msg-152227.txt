}I am coming back to EQ after being away for a little over a year.  When I
}last played I had bought the Trilogy (EQ/RoK/SoV).  I installed it and began
}to DL the expansion patches.  I soon realized this would take awhile and
}since I wanted to play an Erudite I bypassed the expansion DL's figuring I
}would get them later on.
}    Tonight I reactivated my account and arrived at the character creation
}screen and this time figured I would play an Iksar.  I selected Iksar, and
}of course it told me I could not play one until I got the expansion.  My
}problem:  I don't see any buttons to DL expansion patches and info.
}Furthermore, It tells me that I don't have any expansions registered.  The
}Trilogy pack has one account key that I of course registered to open the
}account.  So then, now I am confused.  I thought I should have the Kunark
}and Velious info installed (with the Trilogy). Only thing I can think of is
}I have to DL the expansion files but there is no longer an option to do so.
}Any help would be appreciated.

You're probably not missing any files, you just need to activate the 
expansions by typing in the same account key to activate them.  If you 
-are- missing files, I'd go to the 'advanced' screen from the patcher and 
make sure everything relevant is checked, and do a thorough file check.
