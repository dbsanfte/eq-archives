I'll have to admit that I thought this was going to be enjoyable, and it was
for a while but the novelty has worn thin, I'm going to take a break for a
while as I have other pressing matters to tend to which seem like a more
productive and interesting way to spend my time right now, I will still be
here though and you will know by my mark which is the same as my name. I
think a major earthquake in Mexico and the south east freezing are enough
for now, maybe he read my idea about the mites destroying the crops and just
destroyed crops with ice instead. <shrugs>
