At 49 you can quad wyverns in CS. From 46-48 I quadded bloodgills in
LOIO. They are not for the faint of heart. Experience is great, but
bloodgills are by far the hardest mobs I've ever quadded. [I've
quadded from 35 to 60, and through 20 aa points. Excluding linkdeaths
I've died only once while quadding, and that was to bloodgills.]

Spirocs are supposed to be good but I found them overcamped. Also:
dying in TD is very, very bad.
