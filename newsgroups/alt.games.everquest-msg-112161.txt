Gonna second the Guk and ToFS nominations.  My best friend is a Pally, and
we spend much time in both places.  If you want to bank in the zone where
you fight, try the graveyard in Katta.  It's a bit more one-dimensional and
tedious than Lower Guk and ToFS, but it's not too bad; competition for the
spawns is nil, and you'll never see a train there of more than maybe two
mobs.  I mention these three in particular because of the large number of
undead there, although I realise that should not be a hard-and-fast
criterion for selecting a good zone for a pally.

Be careful in ToFS though, as it has live ones mixed in with the dead.  So
does Lower Guk, now I think of it, but they are less obvious in ToFS.  For
example, on floor 3, the armored shadows are alive, but I swear the regular
shadows on floor 4 are undead (dangerous as all hell too).

That last paragraph aside, these zones are some of the most fun I have had
in the game so far.  Hope you like them too.
