In the movie Aragorn supplies the hobbits with weapons.  Apparently he
has magical weapons as he was able to drive off the ring-wraiths.  So,
I guess some of the weapons he gave the hobbits would also be magical.
The fight also takes place after Pippin & Merri nmeet the Ents & join
up with the Riders of Rohan.  The Ents or the Riders could also give
them weapons.
