PS is a bit different 

They use a "cone of fire" system. All of the rounds fired do not take
the same path. (just like a real gun) Your shots hit in groupings
around the point of aim. Some weapons have tighter groupings than
others, and are thus more acurate. Much more realistic, but a lot of
FPS vets dislike it intensely. 

A lot of CS junkies complain that PS requires very little skill
because of this. I personally don't agree. Success in PS boils down to
tactics. Appropriate use of combined arms, sheer numbers, and often
times even dumb old luck all play an important role. It takes skill
and thinking to utilizing these things, not just twitch relfexes
(which is what most CS'ers have developed).

PS has a spawn "timer" that currently varies in length based on
frequency of deaths and the location you choose. It is still in the
tweaking phase, but so far it isn't too annoying (except for the fact
that you can't "chat" while dead...but I am sure this will change). It
gives you time to think about your next move.
