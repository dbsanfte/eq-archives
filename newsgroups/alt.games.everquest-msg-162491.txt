I do suggest that you get yourself a Tolan's Bracer if possible.
Then you can be your own "mage friend".

Your weapon skills are well over 200, no?  You've got a lot of shooting
to do before your "mastery" (=101 skill, you said you managed this just
recently) becomes true.  Even with that improvement in damage it would
take a lot of arrows to kill anything blue at 52 (Dennis might could
give an example or two) so Tolan's Bracer would be almost a necessity.
Still, I'd guess that once you're in your 50's it's not really feasable
to kill for xp with Archery until you're 59 with a bunch of AA.  But a
stack of summoned arrows pumped into a mob from a 200+ skill Archer
would soften it up a (little) bit before you jumped in to melee it down.
