I've heard other guilds with more numbers doing this, too.  Seems
to be fun either way.  My second rogue just got Planes-able,
and we've got a 6 man team that have been killing in Fear for
exp.  Not a raid, not a break-in...just a little-utilized zone for exp
hunting when Velks is full :-).  Different strokes for different
guilds, I guess :-).

I think this is true, too.
