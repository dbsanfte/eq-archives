Yes, EQ will run fine on XP, or at least it will on hardware that has decent
XP drivers.

The sound will, however, suck much ass compared to Win9x... just like it
does in Windows2000. One of these days maybe Verant will hire someone that
can code sound support for W2K or XP, but I'm rapidly losing faith in that
=)
