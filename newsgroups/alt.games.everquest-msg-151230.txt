Got full version window 98 SE CD (neglected to get the start up disk
though). Had to update to win 98 due to having to use Directx 8.1 and win 95
not able to use it. The 98 Cd goes through its system check prepares to
install accesses the A: then error which reads like " you already have a
operating system installed this version of setup cant upgrade it you need
the win 98 upgrade cd".Tried all the suggestions in the readme file in the
win 98 dir on the cd all in vain tried reinstall win95 nothing any
suggestions or anyone else had this problem. I would appreciate any help in
this manner as iwould really like to get playing on Everquest. also any
suggestions for a good server no pvp from Australia lag etc would also be
good. Seeya on Everquest in the future when this is finally sorted you think
microsoft might one day make something that works, na not bloody likely
mate.
