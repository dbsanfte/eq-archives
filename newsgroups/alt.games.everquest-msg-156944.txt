This is VERY disappointing. What they are trying to do is force anyone 
who wants to participate in a raid to buy PoP. Once a large enough 
proportion of players have PoP, of course they will want to use the new 
raiding feature, then of course they will only want PoP enabled players 
participating so they can use the new raiding feature.

How about Sony just disable our accounts until we all buy PoP instead? 
That way ALL EQ players would have to buy it, instead of just those who 
want to participate in raids. Hey the players might not like it but 
that's not really of any concern now is it?
