I think it depends on what race/model you were playing with before
Luclin. Ogres and Trolls went from cartoonish to downright menacing
looking while Iksar became significantly more "evil looking."

OTOH, while I'm thrilled that my DE Female rogue and cleric no longer
run around with their little, blue asscheeks hanging out, they both
look a bit like female bodybuilders who haven't worked out in a year
or two.
