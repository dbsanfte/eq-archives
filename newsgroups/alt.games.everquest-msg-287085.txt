TSS caters for levels 1 to 75.  The combination of TSS + SoF caters for 
levels 1 to 80.  SoF is targetted at people level 75+, there was never 
anything I saw in the advertising that said anything else.

With a group, you could kill animals and critters in Dragonscale Hills, 
they hit for significantly less than the intelligent creatures in the 
same zone.

Not every expansion can cater for every level, and with TSS Sony has 
already provided a complete alternative route from 1 to 75, they 
couldn't afford to do it again.
