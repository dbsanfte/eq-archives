Wow - Dark Tyger, and all you other us-americans (note the distinguishment
;)
that replied to that comment - you just gave me some hope again.

I was positively surprised that the us of a. didn't immediately lash out
at some suspected-to-be-behind-it country after the attacks, but then
my opinion of your government went down the drain with each day that
passed :(
I could live with the usa starting a war on the taliban regime after they
refused to deliver Bin Laden, though I thought it was the wrong way to
do it. But it was one way I could tolerate.

But when they started the uproar in Masar-I-Sharif (well - press reports
said that it was eventually started by some arrogant idiot working for
the FBI, whose method of interrogation upset the captives so much),
I started having some doubts.

Then the whole guantanamo bay thing reminded me too much of the
german concentration camps in ww2, especially when the us goverment
denied even the non al-qaida prisoners the state/rights of p.o.w.

The one thing that made me say "That does it!!!" was this goddamn
stupid "Axis of Evil" blabla bullshit. To mention Iran and Iraq in the
same sentence - does Dubya not know _anything_ at all?
That almost forces those two opposing states to side up - needless to
say that up until today there is no evidence whatsoever that they or
north corea had anything to do those attacks.

Then I heard about this bureau of strategic disinformation or whatever
it was called - story of the New York Times...

And then last night I had to read about some leaked report about
the us government (Rumsfeld) planning the development/use of
smaller strategic nuclear devices - that made me tick out.

Long talk, short point - I thought all you us-americans had lost
your brains, as I was seemingly unable to find any of your
landsmen NOT supporting dubya's politics.

Seems I just saw a couple of reasonable people responding here.
People who are able to hear criticism and deal with it.
Especially appreciated because the criticism was brought up
in a seemingly unfair way...

Thank you :)

   Lars
