This goombah reporting me is under the impression that it's going to make a
bit of difference.

For starters, I post through an overseas server, not AOL.  Secondly, he's as
big a hypocrite (that damned word again) as the people who shield Matt
Frisch, my new project.  Finally, this is <still> a video game newsgroup
that <certain> people take a <little> too seriously.  Perhaps some here
should loosen their girdles, let their hair down and get with it.  The
operative word here is "GAME".
