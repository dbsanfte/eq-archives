With all this talk of level 60 characters I am wondering
if there is anyone out there that has a level 60 in ALL of the
Classes? Excluding ebay and 'aquired' characters. Just
actually played all the way to 60. 15 classes.

Heh I wonder how long it would take to get them all to 60
and have all their epics. Ugh I don't even want to think about it.
