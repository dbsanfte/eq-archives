Major gamestopping bugs in EQ2:

1)Game freezes at "entering world as ..." - unrecoverable crash,NEEDS
NEW INSTALL to fix.
2)Patcher disconnecting my PC several times from the internet while
analyzing files.
3)Downloading game files after NEW INSTALL (see above) takes 10
hours,average speed is 50 kb/s instead of 
the possible 500 kb/s of my internet connection. 
4)Ingame disconnects - EQ2 seems to loose sync,I can move but nothing
else,spell icons wont refresh,chat
is dead,etc.,going to camp seems to fix it for a short while.
5)Out of memory bug - Cant enter several zones longer than 2 minutes
before this occurs.
6)Random,not specific crashes,freezes,or EQ2 simply vanishing quite
often.

Annoyances:

1)Takes about 10 to 20 seconds until a quest NPCs appear,other
graphics and NPCs draw normal.
2)Griffon Tamer more often than not not visible or clickable,needs
restart from char select screen.
3)The small selection box which appears if you choose an item in the
inventory takes ages to load,
mind you this thingy is about 80*80 pixels.
4)Localization - atmosphere killing quality,give us an option to
choose English on a foreign language
server,I also suspect point 4 in 1st paragraph has something to do
with this as this only occurs on
a german server but not on Runnyeye.
5)Playing on 2 different language servers needs 2 FULL installs of EQ2
- I save me any comment.

Note this is on a fairly fresh OS install and EQ2 is the only
application running,also I dont use 
a hardware router,unnecessary background processes are
disabled,settings in EQ2 are all lowest possible.
Other games running fine on my PC,also browsing the tech forums shows
other users have this issues too.
