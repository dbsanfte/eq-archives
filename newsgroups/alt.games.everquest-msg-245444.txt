}Other than "Ryck Dangyr" you are pretty good with names... though I am
}aware Zinphandel is not an original creation and at least two are two
}words in another language. :-)

Heh, very few of them are original.  Vanlaasaa is a name generator name.  
Quince is a fruit (and apparently spanish for 15?).  Giuseppe Balsamo may 
have been the given name of the charlatan better known as Cagliostro.  
Medb was an ancient Celtic queen.  Plugh Y'tu and Yzzyx Xyzzy have their 
roots in the origins of computerized adventure gaming.  Most of the 
gnomes, aside from Ticktick and Taina, are slightly misspelled red wines.  
Caterwaul is the horrid noise cats in heat make.  Litoria is a genus of 
treefrog. Trud was a character in a comic strip in White Dwarf (although I 
think I went back and looked it up, and it was actually Thrud, heh.)

And Pleut Etre was supposed to be a bad French pun, meaning 'small chance 
of rain', perfect for a halfling Karanan ranger.  But it turns out Pleut 
has a different meaning in Canadian French than Parisian, and it comes out 
'I'm a big cunt'.  So I may have to petition myself to get that changed, 
sigh.  I thought I was so clever.

And I agree totally about Ryck Dangyr.  I fully expected to hate rangers 
and delete the character, so I didn't give it much thought, but it sure 
didn't turn out that way.  Ranger Rick was a children's magazine, starring 
a park ranger who happened to be a raccoon.  and Dangyr sounded funny for 
about an hour when I hit 20.  But I might petition to change that one.  
Ryck Rack?  Bah.  Ryck Nyxon?  Oy.  I'm open to suggestions. :)

Some of the others look good now, but I probably would have made them much 
worse with the last name.  Like the bard named Skypta Thilough.

I'll take full credit for originality on Zovox, Skeeta, Taina, and Rarow, 
though. If they were inspired, I really can't remember by what. :)
