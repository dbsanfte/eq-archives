Well, I'm not really interested in furthering that line of discussion.
I'm sure that Annie is a wonderful person who does all kinds of cool
stuff in the EQ newsgroup - but, wow, I've never had anyone try to bite
my head off for saying "that guy's a troll, and talking to him won't be
productive" before. The response was quite condescending and insulting.
:( The response to my clarification simply made it clear to me that
Annie wanted to take offense, and no amount of explanation would do any
good.

But I didn't intend offense, nor was I telling her what to do.
