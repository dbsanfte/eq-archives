No, but you used the roleplay environment as a defense, which is, in a
sense, using the "they're roleplaying" excuse to defend griefers. When
not all of the participants are roleplaying, then the roleplay
environment isn't going to be "untainted". OOC moderation is, then,
necessary to make sure the majority has an at least semi-pleasant
gaming experience and no players ruin that for others.
