A lot of that is overreaction and min-maxing.  I've never seen any class yet
that didn't have something to offer a raid.   They may not like thier position
much (manadumping clerics can't be that much fun) but it is still important
and helps.

Sure a raid full of nothing but druids won't win very often... but I'd wadger
they make it every bit as far as a raid filled with nothing but warriors.
