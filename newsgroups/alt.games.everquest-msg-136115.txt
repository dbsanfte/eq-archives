This is silly. I suppose the state should discourage reproduction then
with the eventual goal of having a tax base comprised of goats, geese
and insects.

Which of course has nothing to do with the state nor is dependent upon
a marriage license.  I have no doubt, irrespective of their political agenda,
some ? most ? homosexuals wishing to marry are sincere in their desire
to express their affection for each other in what is seen as an acceptable
and public manner. But that alone does not justify the granting of that right. 
Many groups have many varying agendas, but no change to the fundamental
structure of a society should be made without consultation with the general
population, compelling reason[s] for that change, and the assurance that any 
change made will be of positive benefit to society as a whole.
