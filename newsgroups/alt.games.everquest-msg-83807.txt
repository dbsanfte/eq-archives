It's time to find a guild that's aimed at 40+ players.  Partnering with a
druid/shaman/cleric is the best way to go if you can't find a full
group...hell, an argument can be made that it's the BEST way to go,
regardless (one I wouldn't agree with, but....).  Partnering with a
ranger/pally/necro/monk/bard/mage (all have some healing ability) is also a
decent option.

Get that thought of soloing out of your mind.  When you can't find a group
play a soloable alt (ie, anything but warrior or rogue).
