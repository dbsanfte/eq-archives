With a fully buffed pet I would let him tank mobs in Dulak's Harbor when I was 
in my low 50's.  I would dot, then root the mob and let the dots and pet chew 
away while I sat there medding so I would have all my dots mana back for the 
next mob.  The Shaman pet still isn't near as good as other classes though.
