Below is the text from a conversation with Yun Trainer Kintok in Innothule.  Below that is
my question.

---------------------

Yun Trainer Kintok leans in close to whisper something in your ear, 'Be on your guard, 
friend.  You should be ever watchful in these swamps.  Beasts lurk in the waters and
behind
every rotting tree stump.  Perhaps you would be interested in a shield of my own creation.
I'll confess it has saved my life on more than one occasion.'

"What shield?"

Yun Trainer Kintok says 'It's quite simple and surprisingly effective.  Bring me some 
[Stretched Kobold Leather], a [Bundle of Faydark Twigs], a [Bundle of Thicket Twigs], 
and some [Leathery Twine] and I'll weave you one in a frog's blink.  It is the least I can
do for a fellow spiritist.'

"What Kobold Leather?"

Yun Trainer Kintok nods knowingly, 'With a pair of kobold hides and a skinning knife, it
is
a relatively simple matter for one to make Stretched Kobold Leather'

"What Faydark Twigs?"

Yun Trainer Kintok gasps, 'Oh, I almost forgot!  Here you are.  Collect four of the twigs 
and place them into this box to combine them into a full bundle.'

[you recieve a 4 slot container in which you combine the four twigs.]

[above repeats if you ask "What Thicket Twigs?" and you get the duplicate lore items 
message.  So, you'll need to ask again after combining the first set of twigs, at least
from past experience this is what you'll need to do.]

"What Leathery Twine?"

Yun Trainer Kintok says 'For the best twine I've found that the medium quality skin from a
bear and a pair of spider silks does the trick.  You will need a skinning knife, of
course.'

---------------------

So, the question is, how are the twigs obtained?  Foraged?  found on the ground?  dropped?
If any of you with a froglok shaman have done this quest, or have found any of the twigs,
the info would be appreciated.
