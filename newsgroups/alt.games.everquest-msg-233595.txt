Are you sure, in both cases, that you checked a Qeynos Guard and not a 
Corrupt Qeynos Guard?  As I recall, the starting faction difference 
between the two is not much more than a level for any race/class combo.

There are some faction differences based on class that I've seen, but 
almost always merchants or guildleaders who simpy won't deal with a 
particular class even if they con ally.
