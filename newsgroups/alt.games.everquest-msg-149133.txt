}because they can't get the easiest "uber-armour" ever invented, and they're
}scrapping existing low level dwarf warriors.

Ok, yer right, I did miss the point.  But Heraldic isn't made with 
Brellium, which would explain my confusion.  I note that the imbued and 
nn-imbued heraldic both trivial over 250, though... and you keep bringing 
up Rallos Zek, so I was assuming you're talking about the imbued Fierce 
Heraldic...  As to your actual point, I can't say that I've seen a 
majority of twink warriors being dwarves.  I see plenty of barbies, ogres, 
trolls, etc.  That Slam is pretty darn useful.  Either way, a chanter's 
still free to say 500pp, and I'll vote it well within the bounds of 
reason.  You still have the choice to find another enchanter who is more 
bored, or a guildie enchanter, or make yer own.  So where's the problem?

}> I think you're missing my point.  The point is that, if you've invested

}    I didn't. I got my smithing up BEFORE the nerf, when getting smithing to
}175 meant sitting in East Freeport for a few hours. It went up to 180 by
}doing motley Fine Steel Plate combines for others, not as part of some
}concerted effort to raise the skill.
}> If you've invested the money to
}> buy 3.6 million leather paddings
}    I didn't, and I couldn't until recently (and even then with the prices
}charged in The Bazaar I doubt I could buy for long). People brought stuff to
}me to combine, or every so often if I saw some spiderling silks on newbie
}area vendors I'd turn them into paddings.

Right, you chose the third option, that I noticed was snipped.  Does that 
mean you are somehow high enough level to fight and loot in Ssra, but are 
somehow unable to fight a hill giant?  Or anything else that drops a nice 
chunk of change or something sellable?  Even more important, does it 
suggest that you managed to loot these without being in a guild with at 
least one high enough level enchanter?

}> It might be a good idea to look for buyers, -then- make the armor.
}    He does. But that doesn't change the fact that demand is still low, so
}he won't be recovering any tips given to folks based on sales volume.

This can be firmly classed as "not the chanter's problem."  Last I 
checked, the prices for uber smithed armor would suggest that the profits 
from making -one- piece should be enough to pay for ten batches of 
Brellium enchantment at the rates mentioned earlier.  And a batch that 
large is enough to try up to 9 pieces...
