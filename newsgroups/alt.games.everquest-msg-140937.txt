Also depends heavily on the time of day (server population load, which
is directly proportional to the average number of pets in the queue) and
the Guide/GM staffing at the time.

I've seen enough cases where a petition gets answered quickly and a
Guide shows up invis to watch events unfold. But then again, if it's
busy and there's only one Guide on (or none) also tons more like what
Biz described. We had a chronic asshole training us in CS a month or two
ago, (his way of making sure there was enough to quad, I guess) by
pulling Bulthars across the beach on top of people, or failing that,
bringing the named Wyvern down where people were fighting the regular
Wyverns. I managed to get a GM there in under five minutes the last time
who apparently came in invis, and *poof*. Asshole_01 was gone and didn't
show up on the server again for two weeks. Then suddenly paid fifty
bucks to change his name. (Which was promptly reported all over the
server boards. he he.) Haven't seen him in the last month, and I'm
thinking he transferred servers, quit the game, or gave up on the
character.
