Speaking as a shaman who quit for an enchanter, enchanters get clarity
which not only helps you but also your team mates, we can control
anything, lets see a shaman root park 10 mobs at the same time, let
alone have em all standing around stunned. Pacify - why root park or mez
when that ounce of prevention is so much more efficent.  Tash, hey those
spells of the shaman aren't landing, oh well, I tashed, and mine are. 
And the last thin, the big thing, Charm.  Admittedly not quite so
usefull since the charm nerf, but I can solo in areas that are a
shaman's wet dream.  

For all this is better than a shaman, but for all you drooling at the
enchanter, remember one thing.  I pay for it.  Through the nose - in
deaths.
