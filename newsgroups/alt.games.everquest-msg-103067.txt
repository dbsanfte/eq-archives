My 2cp...

/OOC is not for private conversations.  It makes me sick to have to listen
to crap like "*HUGS* Babu", "How ya doin', hun?", "Man, did I get wasted
last night!".

That's what the /TELL channel is for....and no, I do not feel like I should
have to turn off  the channel or stop what I'm doing to put some idiots on
/ignore.
