The US first tried DST in 1918.
http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/usstat.html.  I've seen no evidence
that FDR was involved in this.

Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Italy, France,
Portugal, and Britain implemented DST in 1916.  Australia, Newfoundland, and
Nova Scotia waited until 1917.
