Or they could just role everyone back to the Pre GoD status and then no one
could say they where out anything.  Well except the people that where on
within 3 miutes of server usp and killing all the Boss mobs that respawn on
server up....  But then again they get another try at it now.

The other plus to this is that everyone that spent 5 - 15 points on run 4 -
5 would get them back.
