If you don't that info why should I believe you?  You must be without proper
spells and the like before this info.  This is relative common knowledge to
most in the 50s .   Why would a LVL 53 worry about travel in these zones?
You can talk a mean game and anyone can jump on AllahQ and look up some
spiffy names but your lack of knowledge points to my theory being sound.
There is no way to prove this because you might have a bought the guy with
the faction and gear already on it.   So as far as I am concerned this talk
is over.

But taking people who don't know there way around is always a risky
proposition.  I hate people too reliant on auto-follow and people that don't
know the zones always need picked up and get lost causing unnecessary risks
to the group.  I sneer the prospects of adventuring with you it sounds
dangerous and your afraid of greens!

I got some Scottish blood and I know something our the people history. I
know that Campbell's can't be trusted in the past for their betrayal for
instance and are disliked immensely in the motherland.  So your name is mud
as far as I am concerned.

I don't think having some common knowledge makes one a know it all by the
way.  If I ridicule the ignorant so be it and you laddy fall into that
category.  It is better to know than to be ignorant, plain and simple.   If
you want to ridicule that I think that is all that needs to be said here.
