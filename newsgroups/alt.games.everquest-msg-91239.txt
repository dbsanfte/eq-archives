Oh, and another thing : according to some post on Allakhazam, everything
(including Sleeper's Tomb resets after patches. Which means that the Warders
will spawn again. Can anyone confirm this? Because it just so happens that
some "uber guild" (obviously not near uber enough to be good sports) woke up
the Sleeper on my (Zebuxoruk) server a few months ago... sort of takes the
last ï¿½% of the gaming experience, doesn't it? Knowing that you now NEVER
will get a chance to face those Warders... and the chance of getting some
Primal.
