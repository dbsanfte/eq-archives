I agree with you entirely.  After years of use, I know all the icons
off by heart... I have no intentions of learning new ones that have no
real use whatsoever, apart from being eye candy.

There's also no way that I can accommodate horizontal, 10-button bars
in my preferred layout, either.

All in all, the new UI is a totally pointless "improvement".
