Its not that the tolans BP is rarer. Its that it provides a gate
and, with POP and the Nexus, ports, to a class that otherwise
has to walk everywhere. It is the single most useful BP of them all,
including the rogue healy click.

A ranger with Tolans can get just about anywhere in the world within
10 minutes, without begging ports or waiting on spires; this means that
the market is strong for them and high levels in post-TOV armour will
still bid insane amounts for them. It also means, surprise, that those
sporting them just dont want to sell.
