At level 22, your ranger can probably take on the Hermit in South
Karana.  It's worth a try at least - I know for sure that he cons dark
blue at 23/24 and gives 1-2%xp per kill at those levels.  He
occasionally has a fine steel weapon and some cash - you can probably
expect to make at least 50pp an hour.  Not brilliant, but probably as
good as you'll find.  He's a fast spawn, and depending on the beating
you take you may not be able to med up to full health between spawns.

After that (at 24 or so), take the ranger to Everfrost and hunt woolly
mammoths for their tusks.  Don't bother with calves, they don't drop
tusks.  Not sure about the corrupted and tainted mammoths - I don't
think they drop tusks, but you won't be able to handle them at that
level anyway.  Just be aware that the tusks are giant-sized, so you
need to equip yourself accordingly (ie take 1 bag for food and leave
the other slots empty, or buy spits/large sewing kits).  The downside
is that the tusks weigh 10st, but they sell for approx 10pp each.  You
can even sell them in the same zone, assuming you know where the
merchants are (there are a couple, IIRC).

A way to make cash in your teens (or higher, of course) is to kill
Will-O-Wisps in the Commons, Karanas or Qeynos Hills (and Erud's
Crossing if you're more adventurous).  You're looking for greater
lightstones ideally, which can be exchanged with one of the gypsy
ladies in North Karana for a Concordance of Research, which can then
be sold back for something like 9pp.  I think the regular lightstone
sells for a couple of pp, so that's worth looting as well.  Qeynos
Hills is allegedly the best place for GLSs to drop.  Look at
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=374 for more
details of the Research quest.

Please note that you can only hit wisps with a magic weapon, and if
you go to Erud's Crossing do not kill any spiders unless you want a
world of poisonous shit to be unleashed upon you.

Other than that, I would strongly recommend the advice about making
leather padding.  Oh, and at very low levels kill the rats in the
Qeynos newbie yard - plague rat tails sell for just over 1pp.
