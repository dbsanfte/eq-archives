Bazaar was kewl in the beginning, but now i dont think it is at all..

There is just a bunch of 400+ characters all AFK in trader mode.. No way to
do trades, cos they always afk, and only way to sell now is to stoop prices
to the impossible.
Yes.. i know this is not all bad.. for the buyer.. Ie. the regular n00b can
outfit anyone by lvl 10 now with the most insane gear just farming orcs in
EC.. Prices will of course drop when people get better gear and market is
overflowing of the particular item, but the reason why prices drop to the
insane now, is that it is always 20 peeps trying to sell the same item, and
fight over being the cheapest.

But.. that is just the way of the game i recon.. Still miss EC.. the price
haggling, trading one piece of gear for another, and the occational Shady
killing.. Noobs training the entrance with greenies in hope of survival..
Not that social any more..
Only n00bs you meet nowadays is the ones in the bazaar that go "Can i please
have 100pp for some new gear Mr.
Highlevel_gotta_be_so_rich_that_you_have_plat_falling_outta_your_ass_player
plz!"
