I picked one up last week for 200pp. That's the best buy I've made so
far - they seem to be selling for around 800-1k now. My poor shaman
started with a 2hb skill of 12, though. Up to 54 now. :) (I duo with a
shadowknight - he tanks while I attempt to bash the mob's skull in
from behind)

As for buying stuff from players and selling to vendors, I saw Lord
Bob's Axe (Djoil-something or other - drops in Velks) for sale for 4k.
I remembered reading somewhere that with good faction and decent CHA
this thing sold to vendors for ~4700pp. So I bought it, took the
spires down to GD, ran to Thurg where I'm ally, popped my +25CHA
steins in my hands and sold it for 4761pp. Ran back to the spires just
as they were firing and went back to business in the bazaar. :)
