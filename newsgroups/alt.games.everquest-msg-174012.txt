I probably will, one day, get a horse for raiding purposes.  This is
after I've gotten enough money to buy all my level 60 spells.  This is
going to be a while though. 

But for general use, I'll probably stick with some kind of wolfform or
SoE/SoW.  Yeah, a horse would be better, but it just doesn't feel
right to me to see druids on a horse.  Seems too much like a city folk
kinda thing.  But I'm really, really weird that way.
