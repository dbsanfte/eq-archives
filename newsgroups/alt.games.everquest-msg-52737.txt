    Sometimes it's worse than that. The Kunark experiment with one-way
dungeon zone-ins was a failure, and some spectacularly bad CRs can result.
I've seen Kaesora, Droga, and Sebilis all eat HOURS of time in CR, and it
wasn't in getting folks back to the dungeons.

    OK, there's no excuse for this. If you have a raid, you have to have
planning. This isn't a pick-up group, where planning doesn't extend beyond
"where are we going, and can this group handle it". EVERY raider has a
coffin on the body or in the bank if bound in a city, EVERY raider gets a
nearby bind, a necro with a few coffins is left camped at the zone-in. And
there you go - low recovery time. Some areas are intrinsically harder than
others to do this in, like ToV (where the nearby binding isn't really
nearby), but it's pretty global otherwise. Reason it doesn't happen - people
are too damn cheap to spring for coffins, and don't think about planning for
failure as well as success. Put as much effort into CR planning as you do
loot distribution schemes (for the average raid) and things will go much
smoother.

    And that comes back to what the original poster said about "learning
from your mistakes". Hopefully it only takes ONE disastrous Vox raid or Fear
outing before young raiders learn that having a disaster plan is required.

    Argh, personal pet peeve here. I HATE folks that come on a raid knowing
they'll leave midway through. If you can't see things through to the end,
don't come. I understand emergencies happen, but when you have people asking
for a TL out after one hour of a six hour raid so they can go to bed, you
have to wonder why they showed up at all. (Can you tell I play a buffing
class that hates all the group reshuffling?)
