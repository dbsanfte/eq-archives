  Well, with minor mobs I wouldn't go to any great lengths as a GM to verify
KSing, unless it isn't being done to harass another character... and if a person
is intentionally harassing another player, that calls for more harsh punishment
than simply taking away some of the loot they've gained (but that should be done
also if verifiable).

  If we're talking major mobs which actually drop valuable loot, and this is
verified, they should definitely have the items taken away from them.  I view
this no differently from material gains from bug or mechanics abuse, except in
the case of KSing, you're denying another party potential rewards (so in a way,
it's even worse).  Remember what the people are doing here... they're
killSTEALING.  You don't let a person keep what they've stolen if you can help
it.  It's not fair, and it doesn't deter people from doing the same.  If an
authority wants to maintain their integrity in this sort of situation, they
don't let the guilty party keep what they've gained.

  I've never said that.  Reputation is important, but some people just don't
care, especially if they're in a self-sufficient uber-guild of likeminded
individuals.

  Also, a lot of people get pissed off when they notice policy violaters
continue in their offensive activities again and again over time, and they might
be inclined to take matters into their own hands with "vigilantism", possibly
committing their own policy violations, perhaps in some cases with "collateral
damage" that affects innocents.

  It DOES do something other than piss them off.  It establishes the precadent
and establishes that bully killstealing will not be tolerated, and that if
you're caught, you're going to have the items you stole revoked, and you are
going to receive a slap on the wrist, or worse.

  Killstealing rare/semi-rare "boss" mob, in my opinion, is a pretty big deal.
On its own it may not merit banning a player, but I think it may be enough to
permanently ban a player who has a proven record of not playing nice.  I'm not
sure what disciplinary processes Verant has in place, but there should be a
place on a person's record for "official" warnings.  Whenever a person is
verified to have violated a policy, they should receive [at least] a warning.
After a couple serious violations, or several minor ones, temporary suspensions
should be considered, and if they've already been temporarily suspended and
commit yet another violation, they should be suspended again, or banned
permanently.

  I only advocate handing out "official" warnings, suspensions and bans in cases
where violations can be verified (by whatever means... a /report that proves it,
or GM easedropping on guildchat, groupsays or tells between the offending
members which puts together a clear picture of what happened, or actually
witnessing the act itself).

  I suppose you're right on that count, it's hard to verify guilt when there's a
mob of 50 or more people involved.  In such circumstances it may not always been
possible to verify who KSed who, but what I'm saying is that when you CAN verify
guilt on the part of one or more players, there SHOULD definitely be a
punishment of anybody who can be verified as having "OK'd" or planned the
violation, and NOBODY in the party should benefit from the violation, even if
they weren't knowingly guilty of anything.

  Yes, it does mean that the KSing group doesn't get credit for the kill, but in
my opinion, that's entirely as it should be.  It would upset the people who
participated in the kill and didn't know they were KSing, but I guess that's
just the unfortunate consequence of teaming up with and following an asshole who
breaks the rules.

  Why not ban people for shamelessly violating Verant policy?  I'm not saying
ban somebody the first time they're ever involved in KSing, but there's a line
that should be drawn.

  No, I'm just saying that things should be "reset" to the benefit of the KSed
party as well as the GM can manage, without rewarding them for something they
didn't do.  A few of the epic mobs are "triggered" in some manner or another, so
it's not inconceivable that this was the case.  I'm not trying to "keep the ball
rolling", I'm just covering that contingency.
