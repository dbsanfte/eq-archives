Okay I would say you would be bored with a warrior. They are not well
rounded or easy to solo with.

I'm assumming you're a good Clereic, so why not play an evil character
like a Shadow Knight so you can see the other half of the world.

Stats matter a little, but I've never seen anyone turned down for a
group because of their race. I would think an Erudite Shadow Knight
would be fun to play.
