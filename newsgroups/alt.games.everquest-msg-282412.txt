How very gracious of you, I'm sure. "Benefit of the doubt" indeed!!
Who on earth do you think YOU are?  Bizbee has posted here for YEARS,
as you very well know, and has NEVER come across as a racist. If and
when he does so, then you can ride your little toy hobby-horse to your
heart's content.

Bizbee was also speaking out about unfairness, in the same manner - he
was using "nigger" to describe the attitude implied in the guy's
request for a port.  He was illustrating the lack of rights/respect
implied to porting classes...  Heh, what's the matter - only John
Lennon is allowed to do so in this manner, and no-one else on the
planet can do so any more?

>Can you see the difference yet?

I surely can. Can YOU? Or are you just being faux-pious to earn
brown-nose points?  Stop reading things into something that just plain
aren't there. The last thing we need in here is self-appointed
Semantics Police.

>If not, no biggie.  Ignorance is nothing new.  The world manages to keep right on turning.

Could we have a little more cringe-making pomposity there?  I don't
think you have broken your previous, not-inconsiderable record yet.
