Sounds like you might be running into the same problem I had.  I
started with EQ1, got a Station Pass when EQ2 came out so I could play
both, and decided (painful decision) to drop my Station Pass and just
play EQ2.

Turns out you can't downgrade from a Station Pass to just one game.
After poking around on my own for a while I called support, and talked
to a very pleasant person who told me that the way to do it was to
cancel my account completely, then start a new account when my
existing Station Pass ran out. 

I did that, and by the end of the month had decided that I could live
w/o EQ 1 and 2 completely.  Forcing customers to quit is probably not
the smartest thing Sony could do.
