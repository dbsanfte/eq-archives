A wooden cup and a crown of thorns
Will set up the stage for the cross
I rent a room next door
There is nothing more
No further voices to hear
I'll be free

It doesn't matter anymore that someone's knocking at my door
I've known it long before the Galilean's on the floor
Shame on me, shame on me
I'm a tool and nothing more

I can feel it's getting nearer
Images they'll turn out clearer
Creeps in and out of your mind
I'm destiny personified
I know there's something more behind
But is it really justified
To sacrifice, to crucify
The rescue of the human kind

Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"
Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"

I hear them howling hear them scream
The raging mob turns mad it seems
"The king's in town
We need a crown"
I think we all know how it ends

"So we're not going take it longer"
So all I know is I don't care
"So we're not going take it longer"
Now we are aware

I can feel it's getting nearer
Images they'll turn out clearer
Creeps in and out of your mind
I'm destiny personified
I know there's something more behind
But is it really justified
To sacrifice, to crucify
The rescue of the human kind

Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"
Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"

There I tie the ass
There I tie the colt
Begging for a last chance I hear the voices say
"We get him home tonight and that's all you need to know"
I'm alone

So I can't stand it any longer
And don't want to see it all
Nazarene, your vision will come true
Will come true
They'll get you

I can feel it's getting nearer
Images they'll turn out clearer
Creeps in and out of your mind
I'm destiny personified
I know there's something more behind
But is it really justified
To sacrifice, to crucify
The rescue of the human kind

Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"
Sadly sings destiny

"For ages I've been waiting

Let it in"
