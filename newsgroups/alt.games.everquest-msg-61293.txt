 No PC company will void your warrentee for adding RAM (or any component I 
might add). And as far as the difficulty in adding additional RAM, if you 
can change a light bulb in your lighting room, you can add more RAM. In fact, 
most (overpriced) hardware stores will put it in free of charge for you, 
some will charge you $100 too (for a 3 minute job).

 I've installed hundreds of RAM modules, it IS extremely easy. Only problem
I have had are a few bad sticks which do happen from time to time, all you
need to do is take them back for replacement.
