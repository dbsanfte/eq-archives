Wait a minute, please.  I want to make sure I understand this right.  
A level 25 wizard with 190 int has ( 25 / 5 * 190 ) = 950 mana. 
A level 25 wizard with 210 int has ( 25 / 5 * 200 + 10 * 5.8 ) = 1058
mana.
A level 50 wizard with 190 int has ( 50 / 5 * 190 ) = 1900 mana. 
A level 50 wizard with 210 int has ( 50 / 5 * 200 + 10 * 5.8 ) = 2058
mana.


Thanks for the info.
