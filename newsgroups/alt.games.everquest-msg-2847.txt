One caveat, and this drives me absolutely batty, is that YOU do not see the
effect. I have this one on Rosewhite

/kneel say makes a polite curtsey before %t.

What others see is her kneeling and "Rosewhite makes a polite curtsey before
Target."

What *I* see is, "You emote, 'makes a polite curtsey before Target.'"

Took me a heck of a long time to figure out that everyone else was getting what
I intended them to get.
