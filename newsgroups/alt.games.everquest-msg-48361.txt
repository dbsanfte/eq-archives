We "flipped a coin" last night and decided not to go after the Avatar of
Fear and head to the Tower of Frozen Shadows tonight.  This will probably be
our group makeup:

Rogue, Warrior, Chanter, Cleric ( all set ), and the other two will probably
be Wiz, and Mage / Chanter / Druid.  All will be level 31-34.

I saw the place for the first time last night ( as we ported in and
camped ), but that's the extent of my knowledge.  I -think- our goal is a
breastplate of some sort ( Cleric, maybe ), but I may have misinterpreted
what someone said.

What should I know about this place before I head in ( in about 1.5 hours
=)?  Is there anything I should be looking for to drop for me ( Chanter )?
Any unmezzable Mobs?  Traps?  Locked doors that will get me killed?

4 of the others have been playing together for 2 years, so know about the
place, but I'm new to it.  Any pre-information is appreciated.
