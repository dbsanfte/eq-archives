The SoTF can be multi-quested, and its worth it for every wizard to have
one. it's not a damage dealing weapon but it does help alot when you are
soloing. The hearts of fire and hearts of frost are the hardest part to get,
(we camped Sol A for about a month before 2 dropped), THe Rod of Bone from
the stone skellies in Lake Rathe is the easiest thing to get. at lvl 29 they
conned blue to me and the pets were light blue or green. jsut take one pally
with Instrument of nife on his blade, and 2 wizads with snare and AE
spells.. you'll rock through em in about 2 minutes.
