You can also simply check the messages from your first turn-in of four
items and turn in the correct number to "sync" the NPC the second time.
This assumes you have enough of whatever you're turning in to do the
quest multiple times, usually the case for me with the Canines in FV,
and pretty much guaranteed for lowbie turn-ins like the bonechip quest
in the Kaladim paladin guild.

The quests that are a pain in the ass are those that require different
items and/or items plus coin like the Miller quests in QHills.  For
these it seems like the easiest way to make sure you don't screw up and
lose anything is to always turn in all of the items and/or coin at once.
