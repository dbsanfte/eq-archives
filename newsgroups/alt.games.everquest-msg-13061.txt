    Not quite. I don't have experience with the "multiple atmospheres" part,
but I DO know that running from a grotesque overpull in Hands in Karnor's,
with the usual compliment of summoners, that once I ran up and jumped off
the wall I could NOT be summoned until the mobs got level with me. It looks
like a difference in height between summoner and summonee CAN make someone
immune to summoning. (Heh, guess I was exploiting. :-/ )

    Earlier reports from Conquest web site are mixed on what the GMs
thought. The initial claim was that Ventani was aggro on the clerics, but
couldn't reach them and thus wasn't fighting back. This makes no sense in
light of what Conquest says they were doing, and by the simple fact that the
clerics were casting heals - what are they healing if no damage is being
done? And to be specific, Ventani was (again, according to the Conquest web
site) cheerfully whacking away on the ONE melee. ;-)

>even if it is a bit cheesy.

    Here's the crux, I think, of the banning. Why would you say it was
cheesy if it wasn't taking advantage of some aspect of the game engine to
prevent harm that would otherwise occur to the clerics? And we all know what
Verant regards "taking advantage of the game engine..." to be.

    See above. It could be that a significant difference in Z-axis height
nullifies the ability to summon. Even if it delayed a summoning for a few
seconds, that would be an exploit (as it would allow time for a CotH to land
on the cleric and clear the hate list BEFORE a summoning).

    Yeah, the res effects thing was borderline - I could see someone saying
it was meant to be a disadvantage, so any use of it as an advantage is
exploiting. The chain-ressing the tanks was pure cheddar, too - I doubt res
was ever intended to be used to clear hate.

    SHHHH! The first rule of Exploit Club is don't talk about Exploit Club!
:-/

    Emphasis: it's easier. It doesn't have to be trivial, it just has to be
easier for Verant to not like it - because it WILL allow for, in theory, a
group that couldn't take him straight up to take him with bridge tactics.

    Dragon's Bane nails things with ABOVE 100 K hps, IIRC. I seem to recall
someone on The Safehouse complaining about a few mobs with exactly 100 K
that couldn't be Baned. It's quite possible that some dragons in ST have 100
K hps.

    I'm more of the mind that he DOES know what uberguilds do, and wants to
change it. He doesn't feel that any given mob in the game MUST be killed,
and that it's perfectly acceptable to have things that only a Zergling rush
can take down. When you think of the list of things they're on record as not
liking - spoiler sites, feign pulling, Kendrick's disgust at Stanos dying 17
times in 2 hours - it makes sense. They want a roleplayed world, where
things happen as they would "in real life". Chain-ressing someone so a
dragon will forget about them is hardly RP. ;-)

    I'll omit my tinfoil hat conspiracy theory that they secretly want
high-level encounters to require as many people as possible so that as
people level there's space for everyone to go raiding.
