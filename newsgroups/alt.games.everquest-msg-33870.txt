Anytime something blue or above takes a swing at you, you have a chance to
gaine defense, dodge or any of the other automatic use defensive skills.
Actually, you probably have a better chance to see a gain there than when you
get hit since in EQ, a successful skill roll generally has a much higher
chance to gain skill than an unsuccessful one.   (and I would classify a mob
missing you as a very successful defense roll. ;)  )
