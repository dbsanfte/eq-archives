}>The other funny thing is, there's two different Dorns.  You can tell which

}Interesting.... BDynn is the impostor?

I can never remember.  The real Dorn cons apprehensive, the fake is 
Scowls.  Your mileage may vary.  Especially if you killed a lot of bards. 
:)

I would assume, however, that the one without the ' is the impostor.
