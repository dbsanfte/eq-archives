PIII-800
768MB of 133MHz Sram
GeForce4 Ti4200 with 128MB of DDR
500kBPS wireless broadband connection

I run with everything turned on at 1280x1024 resolution.  Only times I need 
to adjust the settings are the Bazaar, and on raids.  All other times, I 
leave everything, including spell effects on.  I have never measured the 
framerate, but, other than the bazaar and raids, it does not seem to change 
significantly from zone to zone, including the ones that used to be the 
bane of EQ, like Warsliks Woods.
