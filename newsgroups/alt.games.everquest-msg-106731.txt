Quad kiting most certainly is a sign of soloing ability for the
purpose of gaining  experience.  Whether another class can come in
higher on the "Oh wow" meter is largely irrelevant.

Being able to port does make you solo better, since you can get to
your soloing spot much, much faster than a class who can't.  Your
amount of wasted time is minimal, once again translating to more
experience gained.

But quite obviously the intended context of my comment was general
class balance, not soloing per se.
