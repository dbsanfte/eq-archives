Ah, so that wasn't another false memory.  I used to farm RE when I found
it empty, and coulda sworn I'd gotten a BA Medallion off a Slayspell...
Of course, that's one Medallion off of well over 100 Slayspells.

If you know int casters who still need to fill in lower level research
spells invite them along, word/page/rune drops are pretty common.  You
would want to hunt level 4.  About half the value of the drops is in
the form of BA Armor and words/pages/runes, be sure your group has
plenty of open slots if you're untwinked or lightly twinked and in
need of cash.  At your level you won't get much exp there, but you
won't be at much risk in a small group either.  Battlewizard Unak
would probably be the biggest threat (you should have no trouble
keeping melees alive fighting the melee mobs), so be prepared one
way or another to chain-stun and or dump big piles of damage on him
fast (a Paladin or Wizard in the group, for example), especially if
you end up fighting him and one or two Slayspells at the same time.
The gobs like to attack in multiples, an Enchanter could keep plenty
busy and would be a huge help if you don't have a Warrior or Knight
to tank.

It's not too uncommon to find the mask for 100pp or less in the bazaar
(on my server anyway), my Cleric twink got his for 10pp.
