I recently (last 3 months) played an Enchanter Alt to 26 (not listed
becuase it was more of an experiment than anything else). From 16-26 I
couldn't give breeze away. When I could get a group 90% of the casters
already had KEI.

I also have a 32 Bard (retired 2 years ago due to wrist problems).
From 20-32 the ONLY thing he was wanted for in groups was mana song.
Like every bard before me I was constantly told to play mana song and
not twist anything else.

I know the value of both. Most pick-up groups below level 35 do not.

So tough s$%^ if you are a Warrior, Monk or Rogue? Tough s$%$ if you
cannot afford KEI or get dumped from a group for a caster with it?
