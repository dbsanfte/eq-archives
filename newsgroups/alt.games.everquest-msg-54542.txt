You didn't read dstep's post. :P  The surname policy really hasn't changed
at all.   They'll change it if:
You marry
You divorce
Your guild requires a certain surname
To add special characters (must not violate other rules)
To change it if it violates the naming rules

That's it.   A guildmate stupidly named himself "diesalot" (like many people
did).  The name doesn't violate any rules so the best shot he has is lying
and saying that he's getting a divorce and that was her name (I've seen that
done...or a combination name).

Or hope for a GM that is willing to bend the rules and take pity on him.
