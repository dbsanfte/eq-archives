Mendal,

If you want to get Gynok do this. Zone into Befallen and sit down with your
back against the wall looking down the long hallway. Around every 15min (you
can time it down to the second) something will spawn _right_ in front of you
and begin walking down the hall, kill it. If you don't kill it, what ever
spawns will walk away from you, down the steps and through the locked door,
letting the spawn live essentially makes it take longer for the next spawn
to pop. If you continue killing whatever spawns Gynok will eventually pop (I
would think in less than 8 hours easy) and attack you. At 36 it may be a
hard fight but you should be able to do it alone. I would keep yourself
buffed just in case. Gynok should almost certainly drop the Platinum ring. I
have heard he occasionally drops one of the other rings but I highly doubt
he will drop the gold. If i remember correctly the gold ring is obtained by
giving an NPC on Kerra Isle one degenerated guk weed. The weed is a _very_
rare drop off of the Mutant Fungus in Upper Guk.
