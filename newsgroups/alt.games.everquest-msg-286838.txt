It seems therunes.net is just a ghost. I'll probably consult it for
some epic advice, but I'd like some explanation about the newest AA's
and hear what other chantys have to say. Is there some other site for
us?

I haven't fixed the LD-upon-zoning issue, but it happens less and
less. It really can't have anything to do with my firewall, as someone
suggested. I got all new map files but that hasn't licked it.

Ditto the animation bug. They just ... turn off. Spell effects look
choppy as 1920's film. All drivers are up to date, all hardware is
recent, so I'm clueless. No, one clue - sometimes if i zone, the
animations go back to normal, and sometimes they don't. Can't figure
it out.

Anyway, I dinged 71 and have been messing around in the newest
expansion. Seems fun, though I'm largely useless until at least 72
(for mez). Reconnected with old faces from years and years ago and
meeting new players. I love being out-of-touch with the content, it's
like it's all new to me.

As far as AA's go, though, that's where I'm trying to find guidance
and not really getting anywhere. Would love some suggestions.

Thanks,

Fennin.Faza
