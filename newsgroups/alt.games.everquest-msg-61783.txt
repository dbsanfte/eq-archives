The famous Manastone was the best.  Right-click effect that instantly
converted some health to mana at something like a 3 to 1 ratio.
Consider a cleric with that, starting with 2100 HP.  A few clicks
later, the cleric is down to, say, 300 HP, and has gained 600 mana,
400 of which goes for a complete heal.

Net result: cleric has gained 200 mana in under 3 ticks.  Basically,
it was Flowing Thought 66.
