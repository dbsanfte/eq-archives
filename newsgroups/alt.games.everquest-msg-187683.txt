We had someone lag once coming to meet us - Hehe, that's just too
cool a sight :)

You can walk on the wall on the water and be out of aggro range
of the front 2.  Maybe you can taunt one from there?

The succor spot is back by the ledge on the water, so when
you get established, try to fight out of aggro range of that
spot, so you can succor.
