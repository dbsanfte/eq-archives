I asked in another thread about picking the lock of the boulder and that
question was answered (a bard can do it with max skill of 100...perhaps a
lower skill can do it too).

Someone mentioned that you can buy a key that would open it.   I figured it
was the same key as Erudite SKs get so I made one and checked it out.  Nope!
Dang it.

Who sells THAT key?  And is THAT key also no-drop?
