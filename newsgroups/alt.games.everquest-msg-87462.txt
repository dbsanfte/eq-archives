The Bazaar is great for me.

Its my fast route into Luclin (tl to bind plz thx)

it has an arena!! Most of my guild is bound there, so on raid wipeouts we
all head to the arena, its great fun.
We have monks versus ogres+trolls (warriors, shamans and sk's)  and
generally monks kick ass :)  (the first time we did it we totally dominated)
now they all bring weapons and armour they have banked though (some have SS
bp's banked heh)  and can hold their own

It also gives me a chance to bank too.. I generally don't make an effort to
bank, seens as exping in velk all day long doesn't weigh me down with cash,
and any gems I don't have room for I just put onto my cleric in velk... so I
only bank when I use my gate potion and goto thurg, or tl to bind
