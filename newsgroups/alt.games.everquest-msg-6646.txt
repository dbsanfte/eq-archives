I originally tried a utility named WKeyKill.exe that had worked for me 
under Windows 98.  While it does seem to disable the Windows key (i.e. the 
Start menu no longer pops up), EQ still returned to the desktop whenever I 
hit it.  And it is a mistake I made all too often.

Then I installed the Windows 2000 Resource Kit and found a utility in there 
named "remapkey.exe".  That does the trick.  I just remap the Windows key 
to Ctrl and EQ seems to handle that just fine.

So you may be better off looking for "keyboard remappers" rather than 
"Winkey disablers".  YMMV.
