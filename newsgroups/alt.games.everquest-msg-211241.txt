Actually, a lot of "thumpers" will point to NT scriptures against
homosexuality as well, and that was what the law was targeting. No, I
don't remember which offhand, but there are some they'll point to.

I never said that I assumed as much. However, it is the majority view
in most Christian sects that homosexuality is evil.

You're going to tell me that the majority of Christians don't consider
"homosexuality is evil" to be a "Christian value"?

I don't hate Christianity. I hate the radical, fundamentalist zealots
who try to ram their, frankly, incorrect views of their religion's
morals down the throats of the entire country, no, WORLD whether we
fucking like it or not. You can't sit there and honestly tell me there
isn't a HUGE Christian movement in this country to pass laws basically
forcing everyone in the country to be "good little Christians" and not
drink, smoke, be gay, or (GASP!) look at porn. And these nutcases are
given WAY too much power in our government. These bigots give
Christianity a bad reputation.

You're the only one making assumptions here. You can shove them up
your ass for all I care.
