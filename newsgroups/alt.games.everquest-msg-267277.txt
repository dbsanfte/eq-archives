That seems to be a good cutoff for tanking solo mobs. A bit higher in
PoP, maybe 900 hitters, but 700 seems to be my cutoff in OoW where you
face quadding mobs. I'm sure a well equiped raiding shaman could do
better, I barely break 6k hitpoints even with Virtue.

I'm pretty much always grouped with a cleric or druid (often a cleric,
druid and paladin) so my healing AAs had a low priority. I have
noticed that I seem to be healing a lot more with OoW. This is the
first time I've noticeably been hurt by not having anything past my
PoP heal or any healing AAs.
