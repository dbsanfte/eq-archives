This is the list SOE uses to determine on the Stormhammer (legends) server
what guild is in what rotation. This was publicized when stormhammer went
live so the list is only with mobs from that era.
Some sites are trying to make lists with pop mobs in there but that's
usually hard to do.

The list itself is also a bit off. My guild has no problem with IV or Idol
(tier 8) and we're sure we can take on the AoW (tier 9) but CT (tier 7) in
fear we haven't even tried because we only have like 2 decent tanks and
they'll get DTed too fast (we tried it with a allied raid once). Creator and
Glyphed (tier 8) are also out of our reach we think because we lack enough
healers.
Gonna try if we get the chance though :)
