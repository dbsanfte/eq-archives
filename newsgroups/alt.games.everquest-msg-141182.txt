I would go for RAM right now.  A stick of 512 plus the 128 and one of the
64s you already have would be a total of 704 MB.  That should be a nice
upgrade, meaning you will probably notice the difference, especially in EQ
loading times, and probably in other applications too.  Then just upgrade
the video card whenever you can afford it, who knows, by then the prices
might even drop a bit.

According to www.crucial.com a stick of 512MB for your motherboard costs
around $100, that's for Micron brand.  I would look at Kingston, it's just
as good and usually somewhat cheaper.
