Ummm, one word:  Zlexak.

Trust me, insta-cure of disease is a fucking critical aspect of
fighting this dragon...if this actually cast fast and they gave a
group version, it would be awesome.

They already have it:  Dictate is a fixed duration charm that's
unresistable.  They'll probably put a level cap on it just like
Dictate.

Stack them.

Lure is a resistence type.
It's damn near unresistable except if the mob is 100% immune to that
type of spell.  Imagine a root spell that's using a lure resistence
table.  That means on practically any mob in the game, you can get
this to stick.

Because of this, this spell CANNOT make it to live servers.  PvP would
be completely hosed.  Lure resistence is one of those funky ass resist
checks such that you can have 300+ resist and you still end up having
it stick about 99% of the time.

Ever tried to root a level 61+ drake in ToV?

Not if they use the same aggro as Dragon's Bane.
DB is unresistable 2000hps damage, it generates VERY low aggro.  So
low infact, as long as someone is hitting the dragon, a DB wizard can
nuke without worry.

It beats the shit outta the spam you have to deal with when shaman's
chain cannibalize themselves...at least this one, you know they can
only fire off two before keeling over dead.  :)
