Playing a Rogue well != playing a caster well.  My ranger has heals, does 
this mean I know how to play a cleric well?  Definitely not.  The next 
time she's not shedding aggro, ask her point blank if she has an evade 
hotkey set up (/attack off, /hide, /attack on) and what her hide skill is 
at (evade is based on hiding successfully).  During downtime, have the 
rogue practice hiding until she has it capped (I have a hotkey set up to 
hide, sneak, stop hiding, stop sneaking, sense traps.  It works well 
since they all have the same refresh time).

Her hide cap should be 80-85, enough to successfully hide a good 
percentage of the time.  My assling hole dragger had hide of 50 and it 
didn't take him more than 2-3 tries to hide successfully.

Rogues generate lots of aggro due to their damage output.  This is why 
they have evade.  Check to see if she's proccing anything or using 
poison.  If she is, that could be a big factor in her aggro generation.

Slows are definitely aggro grabbers (how often do you heal the slower's 
ass in XP groups?).  Debuffs are good too.  DoTs less so from what I can 
tell, though enough dots in succession will get you aggro.

If it comes down to it, dance for the mobs.  They'll die laughing.
