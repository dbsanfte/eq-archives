Ok.  Lets entertain your pinion for a moment.  If indead Taunt only adds you
to the top of the mobs hate list then why not have a warrior constantly
using it when it becomes available?  Playing EQ is not a Realtime
experience.  It is close but there is still a delay between what is
happening on the server and what is being sent to each client.  If I wait
until mob turns to hit a caster or secondary melee it may have actually
taken place a few moments sooner.  This can be affected by the speed of your
internet connection and any lag associated with it.  I tis not like Taunt
takes that long to recharge.  I never measured it down to the milliseconds
but as long as I keep taunting when I can then I know that lag should not be
an issue with me losing agro.  If I waited until I actually saw the mob turn
then the person may have already been hit.
