For Shaw, the NNTP-Posting-Date will fix the Date header every time.
My two headers are exactly the same, to the exact second. I can't do
anything about it. I forced it with two different newsreaders, I
simply can't make my date wrong. However, just because I can't,
doesn't mean others are under the same limitation, as we are about to
see....

The link I posted (which incontroversially shows Taras to know nothing
about what he is talking about, nothing new about that) shows the
poster putting his Date header after the NNTP header inserted by the
server. The Date used to sort the thread by newsreaders is the
incorrect one. Though he was doing it on purpose, the fault seems to
be with Comcast's news server for putting its Date stamp as the very
first header which makes it possible for messages get the wrong date.

Taras's server does not put a timestamp on it at all, though he would
like us to believe it does (Taras being the lying sort). You would
think he would figure out he was wrong by the simple fact the received
date is eighteen hours earlier than his stated posting date. I guess
Taras doesn't know how time zones work....

Luckily for us (and unluckily for poor Taras) we have other Comcast
users in the group, and we have a fairly active one in Dennis Francis
Heffernan. Observe his headers in the "You're gay" thread (which is a
terrible thread, btw, wtf was Annie thinking with that one):

Dennis's computer clock is one minute or so different from his
newsserver clock. It is his *computer* clock, however, which the
newsreader is reading. If Dennis was to change his computer's date to
2005, it would show up, on Agent and OE at least, as 2005, and that is
exactly the sort of screwup Taras is doing. So we know from this it's
now *possible* to mess up a Date header, even if you and I can't due
to our news server watching out for that sort of thing.

I remember Taras from years past, though (as do others, here,
obviously), and he could *never* admit he messed up. Not in a million
years. He will doggedly hold onto the idea that it is his newsserver
or the rest of us that is to blame, not himself. So the prosecution
must continue....

Unfortunately for Taras (again), he is not the only Newsfeeds user in
the group either. CJH, a lurker who appeared recently in a tech thread
(and topposted, but thats another subthread...) uses that news
provider and his date...

X-Received-Date: Mon, 29 Mar 2004 03:52:35 MST (pd7tw3no)

...is more or less completely correct for when he posted that. -0500
is EST. Therefore there is nothing wrong with Newsfeed's timestamps;
there is no evidence it does timestamping at all actually
(X-Received-Date is inserted on my end).

The evidence provided from Dennis's headers proves that the date can
be spoofed from the poster's side of a news post and will read
incorrectly if the Date: header is after the NNTP Date header. The
evidence from CJH's header proves that newsfeed's clocks are set
properly. Logically, the only conclusion left is that the clock is set
incorrectly on Taras's computer.

Game, set, match.

The funny thing is my original post wasn't hostile at all, and I was
willing to let bygones be bygones - missetting your computer clock is
no big deal and can happen to anyone, and is indeed done on purpose
sometimes. Taras did not feel the same way, and, I guess still hurting
because I made him start thrashing when I broke his argument that
emoticons were only used by poor communicators, he decided to take
another swing at it. 

And lost.

Again.

Badly.
