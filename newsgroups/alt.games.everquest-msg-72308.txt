See them go for 200-300pp on Veeshan. Personally im too cheap to buy 
them, so hunted them myself. Only took me 2 RL days to get 3 pelts, and 
i can even track the stupid highland lions, and got armor that can kill 
them without using mana.
Personally i think 200-300pp sound oï¿½k, since theyre rare at hell, and 
you can sell a fleeting quiver for 5K. If you buy pelts the ingredient 
pr try are 300pp for quiver, 250pp for the mana vial (if you know a 
chanter to make it for free), 13pp for a griffon feather from a vendor 
(or hunt it, easy to get). So that make 563pp a try, even with the 
ridiculous failure rate you can make quite a lot of money.

Made 3 myself in 3 tries, sold 2 for 5K each, one for 4500pp.
And made one for a guy that had the materials, got 879pp to press the 
combine button (hehe, might sound greedy, but if he sell for 5K, i want 
a piece of the cake for being the tailor that made it :))
