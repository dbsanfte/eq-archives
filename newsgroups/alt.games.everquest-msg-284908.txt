I haven't seen most of the Drakkin animations, but I would have to disagree 
with you on those I have. Simply standing still and turning is a very odd 
looking act, IMO. The act of sitting does appear to be more involved than 
other races, but that seemed to be all it had on them.

Overall, the animations felt a bit unlifelike and clumsy. Different 
strokes, I guess. /shrug
