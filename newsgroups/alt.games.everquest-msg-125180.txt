    I find that people who fear kite into walls MUST fear kite into a wall
where they are or else they will get adds. That could be the crucial
difference - without the exploit, the tactic would not work at all. Or it
could be that someone fear kiting a mob that gets adds will be hard-pressed
to deal with the adds and the original, whereas someone dealing with a death
marching mob can always burn it out and turn to the new threat. *shrug* I
just know that fear kiting into a wall is just wrong.
