As far as I've see, the reason people get upset when people inspect them is
because soon after, they'll get one of the following:

"How much for the ____?"
"____ sucks, you should get a ____."
"Ur eq sux d00d." (real one, told to my level 5 monk wearing Dusty Burlap
from Warrens)
"What are the stats on ____?"

Most inspections I get are accidents. I've only had one person in the last
few days inspect me without asking. Hell, I was selling off some equip I was
wearing in EC and put "come inspect me to see what's left" in the /auc and
people STILL asked first.
