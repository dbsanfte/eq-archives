Funny thing is that when you go into "chat" and ask guide or GM for help,
they tell you rebooting will, in fact, fix the problem...LoL...so glad I am
a patient person.  As to the old hats, I too remember the old days getting
booted, reconnecting and sometimes actually still being in the group I was
in when I went LD!  I have also heard (read) that the active character is to
prevent people from going LD intentionally to prevent death.  Now I freely
admit I am not a programmer, but isn't there a way to write a command that
if LD is accomplished via certain key combination then character remains
active?  And if LD is result of disconnect when the intentional LD keys ARE
NOT pressed, then immediately make character non-active?  /shrugs ...
