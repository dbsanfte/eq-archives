I know that as a bard I am more effective in a group but it seems like I
don't get much chance to.  Been leveling in paludal caverns and hollowshade
moor and have only been grouped twice and partnered not many more times than
that.  Tried moving to grimling forest and got warned away for being too
low.  Do I need to go to Norrath to find a group, or what?
