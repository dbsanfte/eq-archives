Tie sense heading to your taunt key and free up a hot key slot. I
started doing that, I think, at about level five and sense heading was
maxed quickly every level all the way to forty (where it freezes up, of
course) when I finally took it off. Bash I had to leave alone, not tied 
to anything, because timing is too critical against spell casters. Tying
anything else in doesn't let it grey out and recycle as soon as ready.
