 No, it's normally because they suck. I'm not trying to discourage
Verant from adding new zones. I'm just being honest.

 Trainability. It's hard to get a group since nobody is there. If you
decide to solo, which isn't that hard it's not bad until mobs near the
zone start turning green. If you go deeper then the dogs run away too
fast to catch them and they normally bring a train back with them.

 I'm boycotting Stonebrunt due to the TLC code. I'm level 60 anyway so
why would I want to go there?

 I did start my twink in Paineel/Warrens. I was tired of training back
to the zone every other pull when they ran off so I left Odus. I haven't
been back since and don't see a need to go there.
