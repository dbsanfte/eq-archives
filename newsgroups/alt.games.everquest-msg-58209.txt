I have three banks I use on a regular basis, not counting once-in-a-while 
banks. The first two are Grouping and Soloing.

both contain Forage, Track, and LOC[1]. Loc is handy because of the 
pause... If I am running, I get two loc's off a known duration apart from 
each other, which I have learned to triangulate fairly well on the fly. 
That one has saved my ass from many trains in unfamiliar zones.

My Group keys have a Healing one ("Healing ((( %T )))"), a DoT one ("((( %T 
))) is DoTed"), a snare key, and root key. None of these macros actually 
cast, as I only want my party to know if the spell sticks. 

My soloing bank has a lot of pet commands, as I tend to charm-and-fear-kite 
animals a lot soloing(Hell, charmed blue griffawns => red scythe beetles 
netted me 2 levels in a night around 16 or so).

My third bank is Utility, and includes /who all friends, /who all GUILD, 
/corpse (helpful for corpse dragging!) and a "Train" key. The Train key is 
to train skills on long camps/waiting for boats(not that I do alot of that 
at 26 ;) ). It evolved while I was camping Dyllin Starshine for ten hours. 
That key does a forage, then a track, then sense heading twice, then /cast 
8. 8 is a level 1 spell of whatever discipline I need to raise, usually 
Divination.

My other banks include an experimental /g 10m, /g 20m, etc bank and a book 
bank with /book 1, /book 5, /book 10, etc.

HTH!
