Well I stopped playing for awhile because I was getting bored. Now I've
decided I want to start playing again, problem is...its not letting me!

I can't create a new account because it gives me a "cd-key in use"
message..telling me to go to "change account" instead. I go to change
account and it says I have to go to new account!

Basically from what I'm getting out of it ....its telling me if I want to
play again I have to buy Everquest all over......I'm not going to do that.
Is there a way to re-active my account?

Also a friend of mine wants to try it out as well. His bank only gives him
ATM cards and he doesn't have any credit cards. Have they done any
improvements on methods of payments (such as checking account deduction)??
If not how would he sign up....I believe I read you can use money orders but
can't find it anywhere on the site.

Thanks
