Erud mages start with a 142 Int. Since they changed the mana rate for INT
above 200 I would definitely go with a erud. You get your first vision
improving stone at lvl 16 (summon heatstone). Go play in tox and painell
until you reach lvl 8 (invisibility spell) then make the journey across the
world. I waited to lvl 12 though and just bound myself frequently along the
way.
