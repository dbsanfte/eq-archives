I'm almost positive I remember seeing/using a command in game that would
allow you to count the total number of players in the zone or online of
some given demographic, including the anonymous ones, by using the word
"count" in the command. Damned if I could find it in the /help last
night or get it to work. Anybody got the correct syntax for that one? Or
am I dreaming again? (e.g. I want to know all the shadowknights
currently in zone who are between levels 40 and 50.)
