I have found these to be a vastly better way to solve that particular 
problem.

I have no problem with your solution, if you really think you can find 
what you need by inspecting random people (which won't even tell you stats 
on the gear...) but I would appreciate it if you asked first.

A Passerby says,"Hey, do you mind if I inspect your gear?"
Zinphandel says,"Sure"
A Passerby is inspecting my equipment...
A passerby looks tranquil.
A Passerby says,"Wow, nice stuff, dude!"
Zinphandel bows.
Zinphandel says,"Thanks!"

Makes me feel all warm and fluffy inside.  Just the bare inspect 
message... feels like someone's staring at me and not speaking.

And no, turning the message off doesn't help.  Believe it or not, I can 
deduce why that idiot silently comes up, stares intently at me and runs 
off, even without the message.
