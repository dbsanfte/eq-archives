If you feel you need to run to save your life- Tell your group. Save as many
lives as you can. Encourage them to run too.

The cleric should always have a hotkey that says something to the effect of
"I am running for the zone like a scared little girl. You come too!" on a
couple of lines and "TRAIN TO ZONE" in /ooc on at least one other line. Have
it hotkeyed to Gate if you think you'll have the mana for it. Or add the
line "EVAC NOW!" for if you have a porter-type who can get you out of there
ASAP.

At level 10, you're grouping with folks who are still learning how to group.
Learning to call it so everyone runs can be good. And if they aren't willing
to learn when to run, yes, you are better off finding another crew.
