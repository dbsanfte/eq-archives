While thats an interesting side discussion, I can say that I've done plenty of raiding
in my day, although I'll admit that I never went past BOT; frankly to me raiding is
generally the least enjoyable part of EQ.  I can see how others might enjoy it, I just
prefer single groups, duoing, even soloing to raiding.

But thats neither here nor there.  The fact is that you take credit for a good many
wipes, and I'm forced to agree with you, based on the evidence; if you pull for no
reason at all when told directly by healers to hold pulls, then you are indeed
responsible.  Not bad luck getting too many mobs, not the quirky pathing, not the
unexpected multiple slow resists, not the MT going LD at the wrong spot; You
personally.  I'd normally not blame the puller for any of that, but by deciding to
pull against advice of the group, you become the person responsible if they go OOM.

You may also be responsible for successes that your raid never would have made if
they'd excercized caution.  This is, of course, your claim.  But that doesn't mean you
aren't responsible for the wipes that happened due to your decision.
