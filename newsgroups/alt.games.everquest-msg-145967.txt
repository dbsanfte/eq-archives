I beg to differ. And really, Lifetap isn't as efficient as the Leech line-
the lifetap over time spells.

Call of Bones is better than Clarity. CoB gives you 8 mana per tick. Clarity
is a variable, but according to Casters' Realm: At level 29 it increases by
an extra 2 mana per tick. By level 35 it increases by 7 mana per tick. So no
matter what, COB is better than Clarity.

Clarity II does 11 Mana Per Tick.(castable at 54)

Lich increases Mana by 20 per tick. (49)

KEI increases Mana by 14 per tick. (60)

Demi Lich does 31 Mana per tick (56)

Arch Lich increase Mana 35 per tick (60).

Necros don't need ANY version of Clarity. But, I'll take anything in the
Brillance line! And my favorite buff is any form of regen.
