Yes they can do, depends on your lvl. Unlike summoned pets, charmed pets are
KoS to their previous allies.

It becomes your pet and becomes KoS to all your enemies.

DC the rusted mail,frog,skele at GY. /pet guard me. Then lead it down the
wall to the river at razor cave. Then slowly walk along the river bank until
you get to the castle. Then spend 20 fkin minutes slowly /pet follow me
spemming into the castle over the brdige and out. Soon as you reach the camp
find a nice spot away from a wall you can /pet guard here.

No pets in PoP regen. Some Kael giants regen quite well. Only other solution
is to DC a caster healing class, like shaman or cleric, paladin. But if you
have lvl 62 anim then you are at a level where you would not gain exp in the
zones these mobs frequent.
