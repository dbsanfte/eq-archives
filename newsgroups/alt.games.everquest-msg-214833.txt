I play a bard quite regularly... 34th now, and levelling smoothly in a 
duo with a Pali friend, but yeah the carpal tunnel on these guys is a 
little excessive. I don't mind 'twisting spells' during combat, but 
juggling instruments and weapons is getting excesive, and even downtime 
twisting, wheneveryone else gets to just 'sit', or bandage for a bit 
never happens for a bard.

Great class, but SOE really ought to streamline the interface a bit... 
for medical reasons if nothing else.

one iksar anything else. People were just so jazzed about a non-human 
monk :)
