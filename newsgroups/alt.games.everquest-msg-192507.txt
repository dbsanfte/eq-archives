It is not a glitch. I ran into him about 4 minutes after setting up to
solo. I am a lvl 56 and was going to work my way down below to solo
like I have done before many times, and I could not slow, dot, or malo
this mob. He attacked first. So thank you Sony, you have now managed
to make a dead zone even deader. I still have yet to get my epic, and
I doubt I ever will. I am in a small friendly guild like many and
there are not many large guilds to begin with on my server anyhow. So,
I guess that is out of the question and I save up money for a
comaparable weapon. (I only have the hole, and whats after that left),
but not much use if you have a guild where most are below 57, and the
plat and gear obtainable for 57 and below is weak. You really need
higher lvls are at least comparable lvls with better gear to get
better gear.
