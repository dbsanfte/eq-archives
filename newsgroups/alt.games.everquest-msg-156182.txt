Two players both have kindly or above faction to the thurgadin
dwarves, which is required for the armor quests. In the case of this
quest, its an example of one where the dwarves will STILL give you
the quest info even if your faction is too low (but you WON'T get the
item)

One gives the piece of armor, the other gives the 3 gems required for
the final piece. The person who gives last gets the item (which is
often NO DROP , so this is IMPORTANT)

The same is true of jboots. One can give the ancient cyclops ring to
the gnome, the 3200 Gp (or whatever) and the other one just hand in
the shadowed rapier. In that case the guy handing in the rapier
last would get the boots.
