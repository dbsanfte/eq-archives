At level 32 I jut cast spells and use my pet. I have some reasonable
equipmnt, but if I were naked it wouldnt make a lot of difference. Only item
I can see really making a difference to hunting is T/J boots when I get
them. You might want that money to buy a pet spell or some of it for buying
words. Pet spells are fairly essential. Dont wory about equipment... necros
dont need it much. At 49 (with your new pet) you can get some good stuff.
