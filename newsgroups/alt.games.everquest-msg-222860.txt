Yet interestingly, most of the people on this newsgroup are getting high
Griefer scores.  Does that mean there is a correlation between the
qualities he describes as griefing and a predisposition for USENET?  

Honestly, I don't care for the test at this point.  I answered moderately
positive on some Griefer things because I stand up for myself *against*
griefers.  I have no desire to "enable" griefers by letting them get away
with stuff.  He should call it something else.
