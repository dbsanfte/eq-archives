Re-read the post. You seem to have completely missed the issue.

This is nothing about centralising GMs. This is about people using
Legends as a 'clearing house' to launder server transfers. You can
transfer naked for $50, or go via legends for $40 with our bags packed.

Effect only a small percentage? Legend's power guild has already stated
the won't tolerate the GM enforced rotation system on that server, so
are looking for the system to either be removed (VI admitting it was
wrong?), for them to be transferred as a guild to a server without
competition, or the implied threat is that they will chose a likely
server with no competition for Emp/VT level content, and individually 
move the guild over there on their own. This will effect the dynamics of
that server hugely.

There is also the issue of being able to transfer dropable items across
servers. This is done routinely already, but it's only high-profile
cases like VT keys (or more accurately, power sources) that have gotten
the publicity.
