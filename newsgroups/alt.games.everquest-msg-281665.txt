Depends totally on the Laptop and on-board graphics device.  You'd need to
let us know which one.

Sony don't support EQ on Laptops which means that if any future patch
should break it - they won't put any effort into fixing it.  Having said
that, some people do play it on laptops, and it runs 'ok' for me on a
laptop here although that's with all models turned off and with broken
transparency support.
