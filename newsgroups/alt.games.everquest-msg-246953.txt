Um...Richard...*shuffle feet*...I'm not the most established artist, but
please visit my site if you haven't already.  I have no idea if my actual
style of art is to your tastes (I don't do anime or super hero style), but
one thing I take pride in is my ability to capture the essence of a
character.  It's not a professional thing, really, it's a personal thing.
Characters in stories are my obssession, and they MUST speak to me, the
person who thought them up, and whoever sees the picture. This is a
commission I just did (a human cleric no less):

If you don't like my style of art, no hard feelings, but I'm only charging
$25/character right now, and $5 for a sig tacked on, and because of my
dratted resistence to paypal I have no other orders, so.../nudge...check
me out.  URL is in the sig. :)
