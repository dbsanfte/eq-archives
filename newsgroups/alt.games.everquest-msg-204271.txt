I got a number of very good deals by watching those channels in the
bazaar.  There are people who will drop by the Bazaar in hopes of
quickly unloading some item(s) by offerring it(them) at very attractive
prices over the public channels.  Of course, there are others who spam
the public channels in hopes of selling stuff at inflated prices, but
/ignore works as well in the Bazaar as it does elsewhere.  And finally
I used to wonder about those who put up an occasional /auc of things
they are selling in trader mode, until I tried it a few times and found
that it does help move your stock, it seems that many potential buyers
just don't use the search tool very effectively without prompting.
The key seems to be to do it only very occasionally (once or twice when
setting up shop, no more than once every hour or two otherwise), at
least that worked best for me.
