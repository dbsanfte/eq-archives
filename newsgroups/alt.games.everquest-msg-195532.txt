It's quite prevalent amongst the quad kiting community, at least on Cazic
Thule.  It's become a game in some guilds ... who can pull the most mobs and
survive.

I've had groups run off of Ulthorks and Spirocs, and had my poor little 55
druid (I steadfastly refuse to get a KEI to solo) run off of Raptors and
Toilers by KEI junkies.  What's worse, they guy who hogs the Toilers is
two-boxing and using them to PL his shammy.

Also, the three IGs in Everfrost have somewhat lost their identity as three
separate camps since in the influx of KEI-juiced necros.  You'll see one
necro taking all three spawns, and when you try to explain that he/she is
taking three camps a pissing contest ensues.

It's really starting to get old, too.
