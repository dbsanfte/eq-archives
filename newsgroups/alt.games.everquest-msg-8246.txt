The zone that that character is in might require more memory than
the zones that the other characters are in.  Try making sure you
have enough memory:

1.  If you have virtual memory turned off, turn it back on.

2.  If you have virtual memory set to a fixed amount, set
it back to "let windows decide" (the default).

3.  Make sure you have a good amount (200MB+) of disk space free.
The more the better.

If the above is true, then maybe the zone file for the
zone that your problem character is in is bad.  Try hitting the
"thorough file check" button on the first screen that comes up
when you start Everquest.

Also make sure you hit the "Kunark Patch", "Optional Patch",
and "Velious patch" buttons.

If all else fails, delete all *.XMI files from your Everquest
directory, this often fixes odd problems like this.

Then try moving all files in your Everquest directory which
contain your problem charname in the file name (e.g.
*badcharname*.*) to another directory, in case one of your
character setting files has a bad entry in it for that
character.  If this doesn't help, move the files back
into your Everquest directory, so you don't lose your
hotkey settings and so forth.

If you've tried all of the above, /petition in game --
sometimes a character's camp position will be set to
some bizarre number, which will hose you when you try
to zone into the game for that character.  A GM can
reset this.
