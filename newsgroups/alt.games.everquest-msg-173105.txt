Depending on his FR, the 60 ranger should be good, and probably should be
your MA, with 6 levels on your highest tank.  I would send in the 54 paladin
as the second melee, or consider just having the ranger in there tanking
him.  The only problem with just having the ranger tanking is if he goes
down, you are SoL.  The problem I see is that you have a shortage of
healers, one cleric should be good for the 60 ranger, with maybe a druid for
some spot healing.  The 54 paladin is not going to resist the AoE much, even
with high resists, just due to level, you are going to need a lot more
healing for him.  You will not have Aegolism, unless you pay for someone to
cast it on you, and definately pay for KEI before going in.  The good news
is you can have the pally LoH himself, and a second pally that could run in
to LoH him, then run back out of AoE range.  I would still see about
recruiting some healing help if it were me, but, I think, if you get a
really good turnout, you have a chance at it.  If I were you, I would be
tempted to do a dry run, not turning in the tear just to see if you have the
power to do it, that way you won't have to go back and get another tear if
you find you are not up to it yet.

If you can, I would try to recruit help from one 60ish tank, and two 58+
druids or shaman or 50+ clerics to supplement your two clerics.
