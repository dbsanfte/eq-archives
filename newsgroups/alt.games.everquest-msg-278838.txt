Hey folks I could use some help here. I have a home built pc that just 
doesn't seem to like EQ1 , I'm on a home network with 5 computers total. 4 
of the 5 are box pc's and seem to run EQ fine except for low graphics and 
lag (Dell 3000, Dell 2400, Compaq and even a Dell Latitude laptop) but this 
home built just has trouble.I'm on a broadband cable modem with a linksys 
router. The home built has: AlbatronKX600PRo mainboard, 1 gb ram (in 
2-512meg 400hz Corsair sticks), BFG5500OC Vid card, Creative Audigy 2 ZS 
Plat sound card and drive, A Maxtor 13gb boot drive and a 40 gb Maxtor 
drive, 440watt power supply multiple fans (4 in case) and is running Win XP 
Pro.
It goes ld every time I zone. for a while I could only log back on after I 
deleted my character files. I seem to have been able to get that to stop but 
now I seem to go ld at anytime no matter how many are in the zone with me (2 
or 212). I'm just starting on this game and really like it but have already 
found that I can't stand Sony's tech support.

Any help would be appreciated.
Luke
