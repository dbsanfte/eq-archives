It depends on the pricing structure they have and how much
you're willing to pay.

The simplest option would be if the cable modem that's included
in your service has a hub on the back.  Unlikely, IMO.

You could buy the ONE-port Linksys router/firewall and plug it
into the hub you already have, then the computers into the hub
and shitcan the ICS.  The one-port's can be had for less then
$99.

You can get a second IP address from the provider, one for each
machine, and then plug the cable modem into the hub with the
computers in parallel.  For my provider (@home), they want $4.95
extra PER month for a second IP, so this is NOT an option for me.

You could buy the Linksys 4 or 8 port router/firewall, ditch the
hub you currently have, and plug everything into that.  These
can be found for well under $150.

You could continute to use your current set-up, with one machine
running ICS and acting as the "gateway" for the second machine.
Probably the cheapest solution, but also the flakiest (ICS on 98/Me)
and the lease secure (remember, you're online all the time with
a cable modem).

Finally (and most complex) you could build an old machine into a
Linux firewall (as I have done) which basically acts like a one-port
Linksys router but also runs a webserver, shares files, etc.  This
can potentially be insecure unless you're familiar with Unix/Linus
configuration.

For you, I'd probably recommend the one-port Linksys set-up since
you'd get firewalling and "ICS" for as many machines as you have
hub ports for (well, not really, but up to 254 machines).

If you need any help or have other questions, just let me know!
