I was advised that it was a good idea to bind for quick return to the area
of Seafurys.  I chose to bind on the landing dock at Sisters Isle.  Safely I
did return there once.  But recently, in an extreme circumstance, I arrived
naked and without spells memorized.  There was a greeter who was there to
make my life miserable, one Dayle Jarnin.  In his presence, I was unable to
load the spells, nor was it my intent to kill him, even if I could.  I was
lucky that a cleric was about to pull me back to my group, else I would have
died again, most likely.

What would be a better bind spot, so to avoid this problem?
