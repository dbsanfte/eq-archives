Beats the hell out of a 7 day raid to Sky. Tie my cleric up for 5 full 
evenings and an entire weekend, and get nothing but a bit less than 1 
blue bubble of xp? if i hadnt been there to help one of my best friends 
get the crown for her epic, I could have made most of a level, and 
serious plat kiting wyverns with a druid buddy of mine...in that guild, 
entire weekend long raids were not uncommon, nore were multi-evening old 
plane raids. Personally, I would rather take the same 4 hour chunk and 
do LDoN. I knoe it will be done in that timeframe, and not get the raid 
message, ok guys, back tomorrow at 6 pm...cya then.
