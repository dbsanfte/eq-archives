Hi bizbee! How's it going for you? Have you stopped beating your
ex-wives yet?
Have you stopped spitting in your customers food yet?  

You know, I loved all those posts from you where you ranted endlessly
about how people deserved it when you spit in (or adulterated in some
other foul way) their food!  I wonder to this day, how many people
walk in to Bay Area restaurants and ask if a Ron Green is working
here?

Take care,

Paul Phillips

PS. Call me, I know you've got my phone number.
