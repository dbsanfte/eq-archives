Not sure where Muse got it.  Maybe from the book. *shrug*

Teleportation around Luclin

The Nexus is a hub of all teleportation. If you cast Gate on Luclin, you will be taken to your bind spot. Casting any other teleport
spell, however, will take you to the Nexus. From there, casting a teleport spell again will allow you to go wherever you intend to
on Norrath. The Nexus is a hub for all travel coming to and leaving Luclin. You can also travel to and from Luclin without
teleporting. You do this by going to your friendly local Nexus teleporter, located at the four primary wizard spires, and they will
zap you up to Luclin. Coming back is just as easy, you go the appropriate teleporter within the Nexus and on a regular schedule
(around half an hour real time) they activate, taking people to the surface.
