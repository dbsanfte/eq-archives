From the shadows, the mysterious gr82meetu78@yahoo.com (Steve) (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>Anyone else?

After a hair raising trip with my warrior on FV, a whopping L25 at the
time, no invis, no sow, through Dreadlands from the FV zoneline to the
nexus portal, pre-PoK, just after Luclin came out actually (which
wasn't long after FV itself was put up), so there were few or none
higher than 50 on the server (and none in DL), an epically dangerous
trip in every way... I attacked the scion.

To this day I don't know what brain fart caused me to hit the + key
(my attack button) when I got there. It meant I had to do it again,
naked (I was bound in FV), AND the whole point of leaving Kunark was
gone since I was going to go train riposte, but dying lost me my
level.
