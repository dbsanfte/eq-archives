But Jim, suppose the guy's busted his ass in real life to earn the money he 
then used to buy the ingame items? Whether he earns it in the game or earns 
it in real life, he's still earned it, no? Moreover, earning real life money 
is much harder than doing it in any of these games, and one could argue that 
using that hard-earned cash to reward oneself in game will result in items 
that are *more* valued to the purchaser than the guy who's bot farmed his 
way to in-game wealth. The guy who purchased his Sword of Condign with RL 
cash has actually done something productive in the economy to get the cash 
used to buy the Sword, and may take great pride in this fact. Can you say 
that about the guy who spent 16 hours of his life camping Foozle?
