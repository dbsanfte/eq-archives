A Warrior will never be able to Taunt a mob off of a sitting caster.  A
Shadow Knight or Pally may be able to but not a Warrior.  A successful Taunt
does not add hate to the mob.  It just moves the Taunter to one point higher
on the mob's hate list than anyone else.  If there is a DOT or debuff
present on the mob then you can only hope that the Taunter is doing enough
melee damage and magic damage to keep their hate moving quicker than your
hate is moving.  The reason many Warriors spam their Taunt Button is because
the skill is not 100% effective.  Many do this because if a mob is mezzed,
it is safe to say that if a Warrior does 3 or so Taunts before breaking mezz
then at least one of them should have been successful.  Shadow Knights and
Pallys do not have this problem since they can cast on a mob and almost
always gain and keep agro.

I have read recently where SOE said they are looking at ways to address
Warriors' Taunting skill.  Personally I think they are just dangling a
carrot out there to keep the Warriors' hope alive.
