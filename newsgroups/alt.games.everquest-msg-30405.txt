Once you get past all the damn green aggros, it's a great place.
We're finding tons of stuff blue to 59 in the pit, it's big enough to
support two good groups, and it's so far away from everything that
it's almost always empty.  I have seen several people who keep
characters camped there, I think they have a regular group there.

Yeah, that's why I plowed through 54 so fast. I figure I need to get a
couple obstacles out of the way or you'd pass my by Labor Day.  Still
not the fastest leveler I've seen.  One of our enchanters just got
really bored with an enchanter about 2 months ago.  Asked to take a
leave of absence to play with another character.  Started an ogre
warrior.  He'll be 51 today or tomorrow.  I figure you two are long
lost brothers or something.
