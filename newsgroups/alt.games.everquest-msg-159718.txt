A lot of it has to do with size of the character.   In the old days my Dwarf
and currently, my low level Gnomes get stuck in the nexus one much more
easily than most others.

Another part is movements speed.  Luckily, Run 3 was enough that I was able
to get out, once I had that.  I haven't had a problem with the SH one since.
(Never been to Sanctus Seru.)
