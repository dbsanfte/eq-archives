For example, recently I was trying to update my tailoring guide with
the text of one of the cultural tailoring books. The book was written
in the halfling language, which I didn't know. I had to hook up with
and pay a couple of young halflings to teach me their language so that
I could read the book.

Languages aren't used as much as they should be (IMO), but they are
used.
