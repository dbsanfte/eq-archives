I am having some problems with Odd billings on my Visa card. The only
company that has my card info is Sony Online. Has anyone else found
additional billings to their card?

I have had my card cancelled and the extra charges have been dealt
with in my favor but knowing that Sony Online has been hacked makes me
wonder if others have been affected.
