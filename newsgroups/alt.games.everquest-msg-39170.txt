I'd never ask that question, because I'd be thinking "what effort to
take from?"  ;)

Wow things are sadder for funcom than I thought then = (

To be really fair though AO could have been great (or at least more
playable and finished feeling) They shipped like months and months
early to obviously make a CONCRETE shipping date that COULD NOT be
altered. You really got that feeling in the beta also. There is a kind
of funny thing in CGW, oct issue, where they BLAST World War 2 online
and Anarchy Online for both shipping in such horrible states. The guy
writing it even has quotes of what he said or something to one of the
AO makers a month before after seeing the state of the game like "what
if its not really ready when that date to ship comes?"

"it will be"

"well, what if it isn't what if things are not done?"

"it will be"

Or something like that. You really get the feeling from what was said
that there was no contingency plan. It was going to ship come hell or
high water even if all you could do was install it (barely, or not at
all for many players)
