I'm using a GeForce 3 Ti200 overclocked to around the level of the
original GeForce 3.  Things are slightly choppy in the midst of Kelethin
at 1280x1024, full Luclin textures and graphics, and max clipping
distance, using a Duron 850 and 512M of RAM.  However, that's mostly
during texture swapping.  Once textures are swapped in, it's butter
unless there are a bunch of characters on the screen at once.  With
Luclin character textures turned off, it's butter all the time.

That said, I'd hold out for a GeForce 4.  The lowest end one will be $200
and should have excellent graphical performance.  Also, if you're not
running large amounts of RAM, you might consider that as an alternate or
additional upgrade.  Windows loves lots of RAM...even slowish setups will
speed up considerably with more memory, or will at least run more
consistently.
