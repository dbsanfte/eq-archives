Since are you limited with the spells you need to choose what is needed for
what you are fighting.  Also put some important spells all on one page so if
you have to quickly mem one like cure poison or gate, you know where it is,
and the book is already open to that page.

Hardly a big deal.. Sure give it its own health bar that would be nice, but
I never had a problem with it.

Doable... but after awhile you should learn.  How many times did you burn
your hand on the stove as a kid?  You will learn....

Would be nice.. but like you said not needed.  Pay attention to detail, and
you won't need the map.

You should maybe look into Ultima because it sounds like EQ is not for you.
Ultima is a walk in the park compared to EQ, which sounds like what you want
in the game it also has most everything you want: unlimited spells "memmed,"
automap, forage is not a option as is pets..   EQ is a game of
accomplishments, like when you hit level 35, and say bye bye to the book as
you med.  Just like you trained and gained the knowledge to meditate....
