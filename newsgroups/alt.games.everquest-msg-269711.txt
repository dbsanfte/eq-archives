You do not need to stop attacking, you just need to not perform any of 
the special actions that would interrupt the HO during the HO.  It's 
probably best to decide beforehand who does what for the HOs, 
particularly if you are going to try them in a pickup group.  Just 
attacking, swinging a weapon, will not do anything to an HO, but using a 
maneuver, like kick, or wild swing, or taunt, will affect the HO.
