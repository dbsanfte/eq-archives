    I was amazed last night by just how nice some high level type will be to
non-begging lowbies.  I had just rolled up Teafist, level 1 monk out of 
Freeport, and was having fun bashing bats and snakes.  A druid was at the gate,
apparently waiting for someone. It was a little head spinning to see how many
people ran up to him saying "SoW plz" or variants.  For laughs, I ran up to him
and said "Brind, please don't SoW me.  I'm probably going to be dying soon from
a fire beetle anyways, so save your mana."  He laughed, didn't sow me, but threw
Skin like Diamond and some 14 per hit damage shield on me.  I thanked him,
slaughtered stuff till the brambles fell away (and dinged 2 in the process),
then ran back to him.  I thanked him again for the buffs, informed him that I
had saved Freeport from a wolf!, and then tried to give him the 8 bat wings that
I had collected.  He canceled the trade, and dumped all his gold coin on me,
about 6 plat worth.
    I did even better when a level 51 monk took an interest in me.  I told him
his robe was pretty (it was), then told him that the rat behind him was looking
at him funny.  Then I threw a shuriken at it.  He laughed too.  Then, a bit
later, he gave me a bamboo bo stick, a few other items, and about 50 plat.  Then
he came back with a his high-ish level druid, and buffed me some more.  Why? 
Because I told him his dress was pretty, and killed a disrespectful rat on his
behalf.  Or, to be more precise, because my goofing off amused him.
    I wasn't planning on doing any serious twinking with this alt.  She's just
for fun when I get tired of playing a caster type.  I certainly wasn't trying to
beg.  I was just _talking_ to other people, high and low level alike.  How can
begging be more fun than that?
