You should be able to turn everything on and run in 1600x1200 with the clip
plane all the way out and 32-bit color.  Mip mapping is like a poor man's
FSAA; it blurs everything very slightly so that edges appear smoother and
the world blends together better.  After you've done all that, there's not a
whole lot you can do to make the game look any better.
