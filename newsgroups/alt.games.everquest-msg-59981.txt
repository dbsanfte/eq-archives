That's when you leave the zone.
Seriously, it's a stupid waste of time when there's more than 20
people in Velk.  Either make friends with someone with a druid/wizard
mule or go start one on a seperate account and PL it to a level high
enough to be your taxi.

But when you have less than 20 people in Velk, and at least one group
is in the doggies, the spiders are stupidly easy exp.  Mobs die so
fast you can pretty much pull non-stop with virtually no downtime.
Grab as many rogues, warriors, monks, rangers as you can find.  Toss
in just one person who can cast some sort of healing spell and go to
town.

The rate of exp is just sick in Velk.
One of my guildie had a level 52 warrior twinkie in Velk about 4 weeks
ago.  She's level 60 now.  She rarely spent anytime in a full group.
Usually in a group with a shaman and a suicidal SK puller.
