Bovine Scat!

Please explain how the woman is somehow forced to slaughter her newborn
child (which you seem to think wasn't a child just seconds ago), simply
because she didn't want to deal with the concequences of her actions?  Maybe
you think that women are incapable of taking responsiblity for themselves?
In that case, maybe ne need to re-think that entire equality thing.

And do you really think that every pregnant woman is the result of rape?
Please, no strawman arguments.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
