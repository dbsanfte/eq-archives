/pet taunt

Say you have two mages grouped, with a difference of one level. One has new 
spells, the other does not. Obviously you want the beefier pet to take the 
damage, so the lower leveled character turns taunting off and the beefier 
pet gets most or all of the hate. 

This is also useful in groups, as you will likely want to be sending your 
pet in and pulling it back out, and a mob aggroed on it instead of your 
tank is not good in that situation, since pets get headstrong in the heat 
of battle.

Personally, when grouped with mages/necros/etc I ask that they turn taunt 
off so that I can effectively DS the main tank.
