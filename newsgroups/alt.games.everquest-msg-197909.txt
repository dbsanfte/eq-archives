: Bah, can someone translate what it means in game terms?
:
: What does it now stack with (I assume this is the difference?)

What it is saying:  IF new spell has less than 400 "max Hitpoints" in slot 2
(of stacking, there are 5 defianble slots) THEN spell doesn't over write,
ELSE go to stacking of new spell.  IFnew spell has no negitive toward this
spell THEN spells stack, ELSE new spell over writes.

When a new effect hits you it performs 2 IF, THEN, Else querie's for every
spell in your buff bar.  First it sees if it likes the spells that are up,
then it see's if the spells that are up will like it.

What i would be woried about is if the new way it is writen will keep some
getto heals from working.  If you used to heal with a spell that had Max 350
HP and Rais curent 350, this new definition would cause the getto heal to
not stick.
