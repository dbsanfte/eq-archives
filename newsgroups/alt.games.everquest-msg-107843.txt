Im with Ben on this one. Think i have ran to SS over 50 timed due to 
wyvern/drake adds.
Have had both wyvern and drakes add if you pull DIRECTLY over them. Can 
kite around them easily enough, if youre not KOS, but if your mobs get 
too close to a unaggroed mob they WILL aggro.
Had a level 60 wizzie guildie claiming it want possible, was able to get 
aggro to show him 3 times in a row, at level 52.

Might be level dependant, havent gotten any adds at level 54 so far.
