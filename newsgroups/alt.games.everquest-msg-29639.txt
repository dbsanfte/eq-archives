Not sure what it's like on your server but on the one i usually play on
Cazic Thule is always desperate for druids, mainly because alot fo the areas
need harmony for safe pulls, dungeons usually aren't druid friendly but
cazic is one that you can use your spells in, i always take my chars there
in mid 20's to hit 30 as fast as i can while still getting good profit.
Worth a try for you anyways =)

Occulis
(to many chars to list)
