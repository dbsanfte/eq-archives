So this begs the question, why carry them?  Why not dump them, find a
replacement, an/or just get on with it?  If they're so inept they
can't be a lynchpin in the group living or dying.

I see this too, but I drop 'em quick if it gets stupid.  Sometimes it
seems like someone just learning a new class but not inept, at which
point I'll keep 'em since they usually catch on quick.  Like me
playing a friends 65 necro even though I've not played one before.
But I understand the mechanics of the game and did a little research
on the class beforehand.  I find I play better with him than most
necro's that level I run into these days.  Maybe they're ebayer's, but
who knows.  Sometimes people are just inept.
