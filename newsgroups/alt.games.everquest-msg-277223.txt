I bought a mace, then realised there doesn't seem to be anything i can equip
my off hand with such as a buckler. It's a one handed weapon, but pretty
decent, and unfortunately i attuned it before i knew. I've been checkign the
broker and asking around but as far as anyone knows, if a brawler buys a one
handed weapon, they are wasting their time, you need either dual weild or
two handed. I've been looking for a site with decent brawler info but nada
so far.

I'm amazed how many cheat sites there are tho. Google is really flooded with
them. Pah!
