Quite stylish.

I think the boots kinda stick out though compared to the rest of you (shield
excepted)

And at least you don't have my /dopropertinting bug (TNT2 ultra) that makes
everybody naked except for external textures (eg plate armor and loincloths)
and the tinting.  Instead of removing tinting, it removed EVERYTHING ELSE!

As much as I like naked wood/dark/half elves, my screenshots are filling up
my drive WAY too fast now =P
