You would have probably been able to get your corpse with /corpse.  That
command either has no vertical distance limit, or it has a very large
limit.  E.g., I was getting a quest item from the goblins under Lake
Rathe (there is a tunnel between two of the islands in the lake.  It
runs under the lake, and contains some goblins in a building similar to
the one under the lake in Oasis).  The quest item is a ground spawn in
the midst of the goblins, and invis fell right when I was in the midst
of them.  Oops.  I got that corpse by just swimming over that /loc on
the surface of the lake and using /corpse.
