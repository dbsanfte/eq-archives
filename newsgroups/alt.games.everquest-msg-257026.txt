That's part of why I prefer using keys instead of the mouse.  To click
on a button when it pops up, I have to move the mouse there (if I didn't
correctly anticipate which button was coming next) and then click.  Or
I can just leave my fingers hovering over a bunch of adjacent number
keys and press whichever number I see pop up.

In practice, I'm usually mashing my Flying Kick hotkey all the time, so
that I can hope to catch it without the quarter-second or so reflex time,
and press a different hotkey (e.g. Intimidate) only when I see it pop.
(I'm actually not sure why I don't constantly mash Intimidate, too.
I think it has to do with wanting to see if the previous Intimidate
worked, because if it did I'll have to start moving to follow the mob.)

But yes, there's definitely an element of whack-a-mole to it.  But, um,
16 hours a day?  Wow.  I wish *my* job would let me play EQ all day.
(I guess I'll have to settle for being able to read a.g.e at work. :-)
