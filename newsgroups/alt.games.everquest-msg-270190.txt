How many times did you get trained -- by accident -- in
EC or QH?   THAT is what people are talking about,
not KC.   There are still trains in EQ2, they're just FAR
less common and not in the low-level zones.  What I've
seen of the level 20+ dungeons reminds me of KC,
though -- I've died (or came close) twice right after
zoning in...
