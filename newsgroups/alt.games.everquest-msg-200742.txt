Incorrect. KEI just makes it faster. Without KEI run farther sit stand more
often. Same result.
With KEI job is done faster and so you level faster.
The skill and knowledge of what to do is the same. KEI means you level
faster. So what.
With out KEI you can hit high levels fast if you really want to any way.
If you are gonna play when you hit XXX level whether it takes 5 days or 6 is
irrelevant.

Opps Incorrect yet again. Any one can quad with or with out KEI. A bunch of
resists just run farther reapply snare.
boom 10 more minutes so run farther sit longer and med up. Heck you can do
as many as you want in quad. with or with out KEI. only 4 max to hit at a
time. Sooo some are always behind you. Some get resists. Soooo.
KEI doesn't change the skill to do it. just gets exp faster. With out KEI
run farther sit longer.

Wow. incorrect and Incorrect. Mana regen just lets the casters play with the
monk(mellee) wearing fungis and hast items. Skill or intelligence or
courtesy of the player does not change one whit regardless of what spell or
item is used.
So leveling and exping is faster. Sooo. It happened before KEI. And will
happen without KEI.

That has always been the case. Regardless of mana pool Its the use that
always has and still counts.
The Heal happy cleric or nuke loving wizzy learn both the same lessons with
or with out KEI.
Skill changes not at all. Yep having mana when it hits the fan always helps.
Casters that learn this do this with or without KEI. KEI has nothing to do
with learning to play the toon.

Actually I think KEI may be a help here. players may tend to play the toon
up in level rather than buy one off EBay.
( ok I am stretching here but solo classes ie necro druid have always had a
tough time to get a group and many learn group skills late in the game)
