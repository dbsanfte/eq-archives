That's a long and fairly dangerous run for a level 7... even at level 14 
there are places where I have to just run and hope nothing manages to 
stun me.  BUT if you're heading out Freeport way anyway, go to North Ro  
and advertise for a derv group around your level.  Dervs often carry 
bronze weapons and a few gold on them.  You can sell the bronze for 
anything from a few gold to a few plat each to the vendors.  You'll also 
get a chance to grab some cutthroat insignia rings which a) increase your 
AC and DEX and b) can be turned in for experience in South Ro (not sure 
about the safety of doing *that* at level 7 either, however - I've only 
been to the very edge of Oasis near the shore once, and the whole time we 
were there my partner was jumping at the sound of every /ooc 
giant/spectre to inn!

Annnnnnd if you keep going yet *again* and run all the way to G Fay then 
you can hunt orcs and sell the belts.

Then again, you *could* stay around Halas a little longer and hunt the 
bear cubs relentlessly - my first 7 levels I found about 4 or 5 HQ bear 
skins - unfortunately I sold 3 to vendors before I found out how much 
they were worth - the other two sold for 35PP each in East Commons.

Oh yeah - and if you DO run to Freeport - do NOT run through Kithicor at 
night.
