Went to Mseru for 30-34 which was also great experience could sit just a
little way from the entrance and pull rockhoppers with my bow for hours.
When almost everything started conning green and light blue I went over to
Dawnshroud.  The great thing about being a ranger is that most of the wolves
don't aggro on you (they may on your group but not on you) with the
exception of the strange named ones rabid,and sturdy come to mind as they
aggroed me last night.  I have gone from 34-38 in a little less than a week
completely solo.  The only downside is that the loot sucks the only thing
that drops good loot is the fungi shrooms which drop fungus covered shrooms
that sell for 3 pp each.
