Fact: The guy was living alone in a trailer, after being kicked out by
his mother

Fact: He had serious long-term mental problems, yet did nothing to
ensure that he got help

Fact: His mother knew he had an unhealthy addiction to EQ, yet did
nothing to stop him from playing

Fact: His mother knew he suffered from seizures when using a computer,
yet did nothing to stop him from playing

Fact: Despite all of the history behind his life, his mother hires a
lawyer and files against Sony/VI citing EQ as the major contributing
cause of his suicide.

There is more evidence to support my assumption about her motives,
than your "grieving mother" assertion.

You have a wonderful way with "selective empathy". 

You feel compassion for this "mother", and even defend her despite the
facts. You "assume", despite the facts, that she is devastated by his
death like any normal parent would be. You "assume" that anyone who is
repulsed or sickened by her actions lacks compassion. You then insult
and condemn anyone who sees her in a darker light.

You seem to be unaware of human nature. I on the other hand am fully
aware of human nature, and am rarely if ever surprised by the actions
of others. 

As a species we are universally self-serving. Even the greatest acts
of sacrifice and charity are motivated by a desire to satisfy "self". 

I choose to "care" about the EQ community, because they are part of my
personal satisfaction when playing the game. I choose to not "care"
about this dysfunctional woman and her dead son.
