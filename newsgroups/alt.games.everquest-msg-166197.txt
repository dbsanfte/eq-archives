My brother-in-laws description of new troll was "Spock's Grandpa."  Pointy
ears, caved in mouth, wrinkly skin.  Thank about that next time you see one.
Old trolls are off for me, and AS a troll I would appreciate it if everyone
would turn new trolls off so I don't look like thatto you either!  ;)

tall.
