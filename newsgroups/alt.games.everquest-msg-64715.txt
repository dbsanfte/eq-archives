You don't even have to look outside Verant: SoL isn't the first major
EQ expansion.

They should be able to estimate fairly accurately how many people will
be patching on the first day (they know how many they have sold
direct, and from experience with Kunark and Velious, they should be
able to figure out a pretty good estimate of what fraction of the
players who get an expansion on day one get it direct).  From this,
they should be able to get a good idea of the bandwidth they will
need, and arrange for it.

My guess is that when they started things a couple years ago, they
expected to do well, but not as well as they have done, and things
didn't scale up very well on the operations side of things.  They
probably should have taken the opportunity with SoL to redo things,
such as how patches are distributed.  I also suspect that their
procedure for updating their servers isn't as automated as it could
be, leading to more server down time than is necessary.
