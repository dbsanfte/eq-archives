Actually, now that they changed the foraging code, my wood elf warrior
with 50 innate skill occasionally forages rare foods like cactus pulp
in north ro and salt in Oasis (something my druid *never* did while
she exp'ed in those zones, since she was still below 100 skill at the
time). The iksar will still forage the specials more often than any
other base 50 forager. Also, some of the special forages in Kunark
depend on where you are; I've heard that flarefire seeds in FoB are
only foraged in the pit, for instance.
