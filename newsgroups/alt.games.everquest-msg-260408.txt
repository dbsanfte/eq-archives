AC2 did it too. And it wasn't that bad.

Hell.. even Diablo2 did it in a way. Each of the four classes had a 
skill tree they could develop, and given that you only had 100+ skill 
points (99 level from level ups and few more (6?) from quests you could 
only max out around 5 of your 30+ kills. The result was each class had a 
few viable recognized 'templates' that essentially amounted to 
specialized subclasses.
