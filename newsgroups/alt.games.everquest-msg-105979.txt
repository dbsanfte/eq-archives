Finally, an example from gameplay.  Ok, now answer me this, are you
simply observing how healthy you were after soloing mobs?  or were you
MTing for groups?  If you were solo, you were killing the mobs faster,
because unlike a Paladin, your offense continued to improve thru the
40s, which combines nicely with the improving damage bonus.  And this
change in Offense is huge, Rangers hit a lot more often than Paladins
vs. xp giving mobs at higher levels.  Further,  if your opponents were
casters you were taking steadily less damage from spells.  If you were
grouped, were your groups taking as long to kill the mobs?  Did you
wear the same armor from 40 to 50?  Do you have logs to demonstrate
your claim of improved damage taking ability?

When I was going from 40 to 45 my Defense did _not_ improve (it was
before they upped Paladin Defense) and, other than gaining hp, my
ability to take damage did _not_ improve, I was getting hit as hard
and as often by the same mobs.  As a tank class I spend most of my time
being beat on.  I do pay a lot of attention to how well I can take it.

Again your absurd absolute assertion, trivially shown to be false.
With a few exceptions, (L19 to L20 when using high damage weapons,
for example) small variations in level have less effect than large
variations in gear, as well you must know.  What is well known is
that no amount of gear can compare to larger variations in level
(other than fringe cases like no magic weapon vs. magic weapon).
I can't think of any way you could make a L25 melee anywhere near as
effective as a L35 melee, so long as the L35 had adequate weaponry
and at least minimal armor, even as little as Banded and a pair of
Jagged Bands.  But there're lots of ways to make a L25 more effective
than an untwinked L27, without resorting to silliness like a Fungi
and a CoF.

The original purpose of my tests, to show that displayed AC is not a
combat "stat", is not materially advanced or hindered by variations in
level per se.  As my data accumulates there will be more comparisons
that can be made with level as a constant, and with level as the sole
variable.  If there is indeed any effect solely attributable to level
it will become apparent when those comparisons are made.
