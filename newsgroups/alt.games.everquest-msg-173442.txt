This is true, but I just want to say that any druid that takes a train
to the zone-out is a fucking idiot.  Tunare gave us the spell "Egress"
for a reason.  Spell has saved my ass more times than I want to admit
to.

As for charm breaks, they aren't really all that big a deal.  Make
sure you have your soon-to-be pet snared before you usurp his will.
Then have him sit and go get what you want dead and bring it back
snared.  Root the target and send your pet in.  Drop a DoT or two on
your victim, then sit your ass down far enough away that you can stand
up and recast charm before they get to you, or at least you can run
far enough away to recast charm.

Same method also, btw, works on rats in PoD.
