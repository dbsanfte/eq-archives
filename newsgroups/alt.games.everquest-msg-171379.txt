Honestly I have seen more stupidity in Paludal than any other newbie zone I've
ever played in.  One night a level 60 was power leveling ONE newbie and took
ALL of bandit camp #2.  And /ooc all over the zone if someone else pulled from
the camp.  Started a verbal war with some other players.  It got pretty ugly,
the F word being shouted....   Come on... If that's not thoughtless what is?  
Paludal may be great experience ... ok really GREAT experience... but it's
definitely NOT for the casual, easy going player.
