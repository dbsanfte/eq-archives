No, the other guilds in the alliance are far too small.  My guild can do it
with a really good turnout of the high level folks.  In the case of VS,
there is at least a pickup slot for anyone not in the rotation to band
together and use.  For Trak, there is no pickup slot, so, if your individual
guild is not capable of taking down Trak, then you are shut out of taking
Trak, period.  Until very recently, my guild alone could not consider taking
Trak, but, the alliance could, that is when the issue started for us.

In the case of VS, where there is a pickup slot, none of the rotation guilds
are allowed to participate in that pickup slot.  A similar rule could be
done to allow for alliances.  What is fair about a system that shuts out
people from a mob in EQ?  It is not like the guild I am in ever participated
in making these rules for the rotations, or had any say in it whatsoever.
The only reason for following the rules is that the likely consequences are
severe enough that we have decided it is not worth it to us.  That does not
make it fair.  Why should any guild have dibs on a mob just because they can
take down the mob without others helping them?
