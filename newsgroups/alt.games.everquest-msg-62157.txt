  No, you shouldn't need a motherboard that supports DDR memory to use a
graphics card that utilizes DDR memory.  The graphics card itself has all
the support systems it needs to make its DDR memory work.

  Newegg.com is fairly good, I believe.  They have the card you're looking
for listed at $156 plus shipping (less if you're willing to buy the OEM
version).
