I disagree strongly. Do not waste points in any skill that you can raise on
your own painlessly.

Points in mend to get to a hundred so that you never fail mend again is a
good use.

Points in instill doubt to at least 50 is a very good use.

Points in bind wound to take you to the 70% mark are a good use. (only
available after 50th i think)

points spent on a skill eagle strike you wont use much is not a good use.
Just train it when you are grouped with a shaman and have a 250 dx.
