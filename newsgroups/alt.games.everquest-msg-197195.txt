Thought I'd step in and help, since it was easy enough to pull up
Magelo.  :) I made a troll shaman of level 20, with all points into STA,
giving him 144 STA.  Then I made a 20th level ranger wood elf with no
points into STA...giving him 75 stamina.

The results?

Wimpy Wood Elf -> 505hp
Rugged Troll -> 446hp

Ouch :(

You are right, though...a hypothesis that can be cleanly disproven is a
well-conceived hypothesis.
