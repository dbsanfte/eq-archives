I'd subscribe that. Not that I want to hurt any wizards, but if I can,
I try to keep them out of an exp group. The reasons are, what other
people said:

1) Their skillset is very limited
2) The nukes are hard, but relative to the aggro management,
pointless.
 
Somebody mentioned above, that she hits 3 times per mob with about
350. Just
to relate that: My (not very uber) SK hits and double hits for up to
110 per
hit in a doubleswing. He alone can make that damage of the three nukes
very
fast and so can a lot of other melee classes (rogues spring to mind).

The only thing I like is a wizards port ability (I do pay them, and
mostly lots)
and of course the end game. There's just no way you can not have
wizards in the end game. In fact, I'm only really happy if there's
lots of wizards in an end game encounter. The ability of bane damage
for 2k, which can raise to 4k with AA skills or stuff like manaburn,
which I saw a picture of hitting for 17k. Yes .. it can make a dead
wiz fast, but baby, that's damage pure.

All in all, Wizards maybe got it the hardest to get to the point where
they are liked. But be prepared to be liked a lot in your uber guild
later. Well, as long as you keep aggro management. People will hate
overnukes in a raid mob scenario :)

> they can do 30k dammage over the fight which is not all that bad.

Needed, asfaik. I so often see a mob down to 10%, where clerics start
to get OOM, some main tanks dead etc and all is saved by wizards
nuking hard .. it's all about strategy when to start nuking and how.
