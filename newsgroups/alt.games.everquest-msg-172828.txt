Well, I can ignore the thread in OE, but, going to the next unread message
will still open the thread.  So, unless someone can actually tell me how to
accomplish that in OE, I will just continue KFing people who respond.  Yes,
I am aware that most are in the other newsgroups, but, it still cuts down on
the traffic significantly, as it is usually the same idiots responding to
the crossposts.
