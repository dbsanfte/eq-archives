How much time does it take you to work that out? To the nearest
millisecond?

Have you ever put your theory to the test? You might well be
pleasantly surprised. The biggest show of ingratitude I've had
exhibited to me was by someone who used full English words and
sentences throughout. My 10-15mins of time was rewarded by....
nothing. Not even a /bye before they zoned away.

Okay, let me demonstrate something briefly. You mention "bad language
usage" in the same sentence (which you failed to start with a capital
letter) where you mistakingly use "your" rather than "you're". That is
bad language usage. Will I disregard the content of your words due to
such blatant errors? No.

Now to answer your question:-

Am I saying that computer usage is an excuse for bad language usage?

Yes and no. What I'm saying is that someone who is unfamiliar with a
QWERTY keyboard should not be dismissed as in idiot just because he
resorts to lingual shortcuts in order to communicate his thoughts
before the person he is addressing has given up waiting for a response
and buggered off.

I'm not suggesting that poor keyboard usage is an excuse; I'm
suggesting it might be a *reason*.

I tend not to validate my views based on the number of people who
agree with me. I validate my views based on logical thought processes.

On this subject, we will have to agree to disagree.

Agreed.

It is just as well (for you) that the majority of usenet users are
more forgiving about spelling. Your above sentence contained 3 errors.

>If it annoys you so much, keep doing it.  

As I explained in my first post in the thread; I don't do it.

>Just don't get pissy if somone refused help for it.

I don't get pissy. I just feel sorry for those who are dismissed so
summarily due to their chosen style of communication.
