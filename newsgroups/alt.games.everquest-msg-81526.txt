Looks like MMRPG's have matured and moved on Bizbee, but you haven't. What
have Verant done? They have given you a medium where you grief activities
(killing someone over and over again...) have been newted so you have
decided that you will fight back with the only avenue left for you to cause
grief: repeatedly paging GM's on people over the slightest infractions.

Your not just playing your game, you have appointed yourself policeman
making sure everyone else plays their game your interpretation and even
going so far as arguing with GM's over what you consider an acceptable
name/behaviour according to the rules so obscure you are the only one
pedantic enough to care. Your dialling 911 everytime you spot a jaywalker.

This isn't UO in case you haven't notice, your a soldier who has been
trained to fight dirty but the war is over and you can't stop yourself. I
wander around EQ and I rarely encounter jerkish behaviour - even from people
with names like Leggolys. My Shaman made it to 29 without being paged for
his name because no-one had a reason to page me, I didn't cause anyone ill
will. Just played my game and handed out buffs, sows and heals randomly -
hardly jerkish behaviour. Of course I see immature behaviour everyday - as
would you. Proberly because we are OLDER than most of the other players we
meet - Duh.

Yes - I played UO and I spent a couple of years on RCGUO so I am well aware
of you and your behaviour. The thing is - the gaming enviroment has improved
immensley for us since then but you have stayed exactly the same.
