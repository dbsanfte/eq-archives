Dunno about trolls, but there seem to be some strange behaviours with 2H
weapons..
Some characters use the 2HS weapons the right way, others dont.

2HPierce seems to use the weapon in 1 hand and use it to pierce. I know it
might be.. uhm.. kinda hard to make an animation getting this right.. think
about it.. if you are to take a big stick and use it to "pierce" (thrust it
forward) would you hold it in your right hand, then grab it with the left
hand as it goes forward and push it forward using both hands? Think it would
be doable, but as of now the "piercing motion" is only done by one hand..

Now.. if you take the weapon on the picture, it is i think 2-3 weapons that
look like that one, the only one i really just taken a look on is the "spiny
great mace" 2HB weapon. (looong time ago) but when my BST used this weapon
(for the looks, and training some 2HB wich i eventually did not wanna bother
any more with.. hehe) he used this with the same motion as the 2HP weapon i
was describing above.. Have not tested this for 7-8 months now, so it might
have changed tho.
