And I have been in a pickup group with someone lower level than me,
and gotten teeth to drop (which are part of TCC) without getting exp.
If you can reproduce this, I would bug it, as I searched through every
match on warrens or trivial combat in the castersrealm.com archives
and found nothing that matches what you've said, but I did find
several instances which matched what I've already posted.  Of course
we have folks here who swear that you can get taunt to go up without
priming.
