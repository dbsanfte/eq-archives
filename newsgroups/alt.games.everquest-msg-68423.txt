I disagree that Verant screwed up.

The notion that they did not test the software is absurd, the software
worked amazingly well for an initial release into an extraordinary
operational environment. There is no way to completely emulate EQ's
operational environment in a limited test suite. In house testing had
reached a point of diminished returns and, as typical with modern game
software development, was released with the expectation of further patching.
This may seem inconvenient to some who paid $30 for Luclin and $40 for the
Trilogy (that was sarcasm - game software is incredibly cheap relative to
other types of software or entertainment), but it is the only effective way
to release complex - non critical - software.

Anyone who remembers the late-great flight sim software market has seen this
cycle. Micropose Falcon 4 spent years in development and test, the
technology changed faster than they were able to test a release version of
the code and the sim was re-written several times by different programming
staff. Year after year passed and Microprose finally said "Release it Now".
Even after years of in house testing, the initial release was horribly
bugged. Falcon 4 support by MP was stopped after a couple of patches and the
cost of the effort doomed the entire hard core flight sim market. Within
months of the release, though, patching efforts turned Falcon 4 into the
greatest hard core sim ever written. In fact, almost all of the patches were
written by outside hackers writing assembly patches, since MP stopped
factory support.

Within days of the release of Luclin, patches have greatly improved EQ.
These improvements could not have been made even with months of additional
in house testing.

As far as "Why couldn't they leave EQ alone" complaints go, well - Verant
had a choice to make. Move forward or wither on the vine. The software base
is shared amongst thousands of users and the software must run on all of
their vastly different machines. The new system requirements are relatively
high for today's computers, but not if you are looking forward to the next
2-3 years. Also, I believe Verant did a reasonable job in allowing the lower
end machines to still play the game by including several tuning options.
