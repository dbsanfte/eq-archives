Without the epic, shaman have two lines of DoTs, slow disease based ones,
and fast poison based ones.  At 54, I have the two best DoTs I will be
getting, got them at 49 I think.  They each do about 1k damage.  When I
solo, I pull with my best debuff spell, run to a safish spot, root the mob.
So far, he has not hit me at all.  I move out as far as I can, and cast one
DoT (has a DD component on both), if root breaks, I run off a ways, and
reroot.  Still no damage on me.  Cast second DoT, run reroot if needed.
Move off out of spell range, sit and med.  When root breaks, stand, keep
trying to cast until mob is in range, if not resisted, mob is rooted before
it hits me.  Refresh DoTs and roots as needed.  The shaman epic adds a third
stackable DoT that is equivalent to the other two.  The only time I get hit
doing this is when root is resisted, and I don't turn to run fast enough, or
when I make a mistake gauging the distance.

No question there at all.  If I had snare, it would make my soloing much
easier.

I know when I ask what my druid friends are up to when they aren't grouping,
it is almost inevitably, quadding CS.
