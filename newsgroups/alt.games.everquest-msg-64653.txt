You should be able to disable onboard VGA in the BIOS and then set primary
boot device to AGP.
I hope you MoBo has an AGP or that is going to make things difficult (many
don't, they have onboard, why waste space on AGP)

Word of advice about buying PC's/MotherBoards. If you intend to play games
on them do NOT get one with onboard ANYTHING.
