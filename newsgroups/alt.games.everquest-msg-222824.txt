    I've been watching the scores of people in my guild. Most of them are
very mellow, don't make waves, to the point that they let people walk over
them in groups a bit. They're all scoring very low, many of them getting 0
in Grief. For someone that enjoys taunting to score 75% doesn't say as much
about you as it does the average EQ player. The average EQ player doesn't do
any of the things listed as "grief" play, so relative to them, you're a
griefer. This is a relative scale, not an absolute one.
