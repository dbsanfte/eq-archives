Lets point out he hasnt bought the computer yet - he is waiting to get it -
and wants to make sure it works with EQ, before he shells out.

So. You're jealous, and being an obnoxious moron and he's checking his
new purchase will do what he wants before he shells out a substantial
amount of cash, by asking a group full of geeks dedicated to the game
he wants to play.

Sure. He's the one with the problem. Right.
