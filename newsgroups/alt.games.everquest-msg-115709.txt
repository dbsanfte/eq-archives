And that has never been my position, I always offer to pay.  Many druids
feel that a tell asking if they will buff for plat is a major injustice.
And maybe they feel that way from 10 billion level 1 peeps demanding sow.
But Im not level 1, and im offering an amount of plat that makes the mana
expenditure pale in ratio comparision.  If they dont want to do it, just say
no.  Will I stop offering plat for a port, no.  I dont assume its something
they owe me, im offering to pay them for a service.  If they get all bent
over it nothing I can do about it.

Since I play on the same server as Lokari's toon and know he/she doesnt like
it, and know him in real life Ill just refrain from asking him, not like we
travel int he same circles anyway but I will respect it, just like I would
respect any druid that said no.  the people to badger druids can /D me for a
donate, Im happy to hand some out.
