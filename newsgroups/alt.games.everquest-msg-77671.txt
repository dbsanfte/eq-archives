Yep.  On a lesser system than yours, too.  I have a PII-450, 256 MB
RAM and a 64 MB ATI Radeon whatever it is.  Windows XP.

If you upgraded from a previous rev to XP, I'm not surprised you're
having problems. I know, I know.  

I reinstalled the OS from scratch and have not had a serious problem
with the system since.
