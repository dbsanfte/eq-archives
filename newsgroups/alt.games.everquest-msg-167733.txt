No, there isn't really.  But there's better gear, since protection becomes
impossible.  Get more HP, more Mana, more wisdom... and best of all, get focus
effects and clicky items.  Oh, and get a horse.

Yes, especially as a cleric you are more than capable of going to Kael with
higher level raids or just camping the bank area with a single group of higher
powered friends.  A group entirely composed of level 46 people would have some
trouble there, but not by low 50s.  Skyshrine gear, although featuring better
stats, is actually less useful in a way, since its the same clicky effects but
you can't realistically get it until mid to upper 50s, where the effects aren't
as pronounced.

The gear can't be handed down, its no drop, but it can be multi-quested; higher
tier guilds that are back in Kael to kill big targets like Vindi or AOW often
end up with some of this gear which is not useful for any of their members, so
they sell it to help offset peridot and coffin and hate/air stone costs.

Plane of Hate armor is in your reach as an upper 40s guild, drops a LOT up
there, and its class specific, so you will only be competing with the few other
clerics on the raid for it.   Many pieces of Donals armor are also decent for
your level, featuring high AC (it will continue to mean something for a while
yet) and interesting clicky effects.  But by and large, good cleric armor
doesn't come in sets, it comes piecemeal; unless you wanted a matching set for
the visual effect, there's little to reccomend any given complete visible kit of
armor.
