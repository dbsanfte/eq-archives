You must have missed the part where he said that he would ask Cox to stop
carrying it, not that he would ask Cox to remove it from the internet.  Cox,
as is the case with any other internet provider, has the option of picking
and choosing what content they will provide to their customers.  He would
like to encourage Cox to make some specific choices in this regard.  If you
are a Cox customer as well, and you are not happy with whatever choices Cox
makes in this regard, you are free to find another provider.  The same is
true for Sanjian.

Personally, I prefer that my provider place no restrictions on the content,
but, I do understand that other people have other opinions in this regard,
and they have the option of finding a provider that caters to them, or of
asking their current provider to change it's policies.
