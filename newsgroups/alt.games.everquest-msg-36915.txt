And here's my response to that: EVERYONE ELSE who has EVERY played a
taunting class has NEVER had taunt go up before putting that first
point into it, even those who hit taunt EVERY time it popped for 15
levels. So, either DaFoo is right and you are full of shit, or you are
somehow being given special treatment by the game or have hacked it,
neither of which are very likely.
