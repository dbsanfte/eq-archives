With this I'm in full agreement.  The ability to see in 
a dungeon group is vastly underated by the naysayers of 
the change.  Interestingly enough, by their comments, many
of them have not played casters much, or grouped them 
much.

Then they're good learning dungeons.  Learning to deal
with the enclosed space, adds and runners is even more
vital at higher levels.

Bards are an enchanter hybrid.  Lullaby is still pretty
effective in the 20's (I used it on my first char before
it was originally nerfed, and I saw it used by a 20's
bard after it was fixed to it's current state.)
