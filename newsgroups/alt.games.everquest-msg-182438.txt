Earlier this week I was in a small group (my ranger, a shammy, and a pally)
by the ulthork tree in EW.  Since a lot of the good old zones are empty now,
we were the only ones out there (and the only other group in EW was at the
Rygorr fort).  All of the sudden along come a druid (in dog form) with KEI
and starts pulling 10 - 12 mobs at a time.  Three or four die, and he just
scoops up more.  Hunters .... Warriors ... Rhinos ... Walrii .... pretty
much everything but snow bunnies.  /w revealed the druid to be lvl 34.

Now, I have a retired 54 druid (all 54 lvls earned pre-KEI), so I know what
a druid of that level is and isn't capable of.

When a single character, under the effect of a single spell, can effectively
empty an outdoor hunting area to the point that the only other group in the
area has to leave ... wellsir, to me that's an indication that the spell in
question should be a prime target for the nerf bat.

KEI needs to be nerfed.  Flame me if you will.  I've been married for 16
years ... I seriously doubt there's anything you can do to me that'll even
come close to what's already been done.  But KEI needs to be nerfed.
