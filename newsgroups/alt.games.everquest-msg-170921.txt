Not the same situation at all.  Druids got Incomplete Heal which heals
for less at the same mana cost, and at a higher level.  This would be
more like giving druids full on Complete Heal at level 29, for less
mana.

This spell (apparently) has a lower mana cost at a lower level.  I
could see how Shaman can see this as stepping on their toes.
