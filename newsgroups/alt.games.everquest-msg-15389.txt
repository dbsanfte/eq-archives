The part where it's your opinion, which differs from my opinion.  If I go 
to Men's Wearhouse to buy a suit, they have a tremendous rack of suits, 
all black, and I'd have to look at the tags to know which one's a what.  
I'd have to inspect them very carefully to determine that this one is 
superior to tht one, or that the otherone, while chaper, looks better on 
me.  

I think having different items with similar graphics is not a mung, it's 
bloody realistic.

}> _that_ is how much I would know.  I wouldn't know whether it was a 
}> Damask Robe or a Raw Silk Tunic ulness I checked the tag.
}You would know if is FCUK or Hilfiger..

No, actually, I wouldn't particularly.  I'm not sure I've ever even heard 
of the first one.  Hilfiger seems to like emblazoning his name across most 
of his stuff, so yes, I might be able to spot that one. :)  Strangely 
enough, that's also exactly why I'd never wear his stuff.  I want to be 
clothed, not his personal advertising billboard.

And given the fantasy environment, I think it would be very un-fitting to 
assume that each and every piece has its brand name written across it in 
such a stunning, easily legible at a distance manner.  I think it much 
more likely, given the lack of mass manufacturing processes in _most_ 
fantasy environments, that every single Green Silken Drape on the planet 
would come out looking somewhat different from all the others.  That no 
two Silver Amber rings would be exactly alike, but would reflect the 
jewelcrafting style of the particular jeweler who made them, and the 
artistic statement he felt like making on that particular day.

the 'need to look at the tag'
}analgy falls down on reference to design in the real world and come on,are
}you telling me its unreasonable to have items distinctive...Verant make
}that choice anyway not us....we are playing the heroes :)

Yes, it falls down if you try to apply real-world design principles that 
appeared maybe as far back as 1980 to a fantasy environment, which in my 
mind is much closer to middle ages or renaissance.

}Ooooooh big assumptions to cover your argument....In game I say or do

Err, which line I quoted?  Note I said "You _may_ not..."  That does not 
mean that you definitely don't.   I don't see where I assumed anything.  
It is entirely possible that you feel that way, and entirely likely that 
feeling that way would lead you to face the choice I describe.  What you 
do from that point is up to you.

}Dont invent my behaviour to cover your butt in a discussion.

I'm not inventing your behaviour.  I'm describing bhaviour I've seen.  
Whether or not that description applies to you is up to you.
