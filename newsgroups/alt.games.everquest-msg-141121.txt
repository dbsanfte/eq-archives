I don't know, but I am awaiting the answer because I am having the same
problem.  I change mine to group and it always switches back to say when I
log on, or go LD.  It's very annoying.  I tried the Options window for chat,
and the various drop down menus and found nothing to change the default
(unless I'm missing something).
