Get either the:

Geforce 4, 4200, 128 meg ram  (not out yet, retail will be $199)

Geforce 4, 4400 128 meg ram $299

Geforce 4, 4600 128 meg ram $399

The differences in these are mainly frames per second, so if you are
like me and you don't really care about benchmark potential, wait for
the 4200. Its going to to the same job more than well enough. I think
they are holding off on it to sell as many 4400 and 4600 first,
because who is going to buy those otherwise when the 4200 has the same
advantages but is $199?

All are hardware direct x 8, T and L, etc next generation cards. Don't
get anything that says MX, even if it is a geforce 4. They are still
fairly pricey for the 64 meg MX's so you may as well spend twice as
much for the 4 4200.
