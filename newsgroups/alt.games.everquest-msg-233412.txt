At your level, I'd try chantkiting.

Any bard can do a threetwist; if your connection is good you can do a
consistent fourtwist.  Target a mob, get in range of it, twist three DoT
songs and Selo's with your best percussion equipped.  Mob chases you, you
run the other way.  Pick up a few adds (it's important) and stay out of
range.

Why adds?  Because a single mob that's hurt will run unless it has friends
around.  So by keeping a few adds on the same faction set as what you're
kiting, you'll keep the mobs moving after you and you won't have to chase
them.  Not to mention that your next target is following you around - no
need to hunt for 'em.

Charmkiting / swarmkiting is much more complex, but far faster XP.  For
that, I refer  you to eqdiva as others have.

Raivenn,
