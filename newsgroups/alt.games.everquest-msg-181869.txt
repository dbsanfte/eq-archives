I bet every ranger you know still uses the other epic sword for the ATK
boost during archery.

Then we are confusing the meaning of "high-end"

To me high-end means the current, top items...  weapons that set the
standard, not weapons that take a certain level to obtain (there are certain
things I can solo for, that are better than the loot an entire raid of 60
people could get)

Epics are Kunark era... they may have been high-end back then, now most
don't even rate.

Luclin made just about every epic useless (shitload of EB for warriors, ssra
and tunare piercer for rogue, ABHS/cursed claw for rangers, Sword of
ssra/goldenrod/Serus for knights, and so on)

The only epic that was really "unbeatable" was monks... and PoP changed
that.
The PoP haste spells won't stack with monk epic, rangers SoT atk buff won't
stack with epic...

No, I was clarifying it for the confused
