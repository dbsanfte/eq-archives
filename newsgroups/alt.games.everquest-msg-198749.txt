I'm of mixed feelings about this.  Currently I'm leveling up a frogluk pally
for fun.  I've got him up to level 10 atm - yay spells!

I don't two-box - one account is sufficient, thanks - so I've been going it
solo.  I twinked the heck out of him and he's got some pretty good armor.  I
bought him one 2HS, one 2HB, one 1HB, one 1HS, and a piercer.  Off he went
into the wilderness.

I tend to be anal-retentive about skill-ups.  From my very first character
on up, every time I level I spend some time maxing out my skills.  I pound
the Sense Heading key, I cast spells over and over again to make out
evocation et. al., I swim around in circles, I taunt NPC's.

What's killing this character is weapons skills.  I have five weapons skills
to max up, but so far I'm only to about 50 in 1HB; all the rest are hovering
around 5.  I'm levelling faster than I can get skill-ups.  Darnit.

When I hit level 9 and got my spells, I went to PoK and got a KEI.  I used
KEI to max out all my spell skills (it's nice that while I'm in PoK I can
cast Cease on myself without actually ever getting stunned), then decided to
return to Monual's old stomping grounds - the Field of Bone.  While I was
there, I saw a druid power-leveling an SK.  The druid cast a nice Damage
Shield on me.  With the Damage Shield, I went fearlessly up to reds and
whacked them good.  (Yes, I *know* it's a red, you don't have to chastize me
for wanting to attack, stoopid game engine!)  I shot through level 9
rapidly, far outstripping the ability of any of my skills to catch up.

Eventually I died just before dinging 10 when five reds at once proved to be
too much.  Instead of grabbing another KEI and heading back to the FoB, I
went back to killing burly kobolds and the like until I dinged 10, this time
getting some weapon skill-ups in the process.

So: having uber spells cast on you makes some things a lot easier, like
getting spell-casting skill-ups or getting levels quickly.  It makes some
things harder, like having your weapons skills keep pace with your level.
So I'll probably miss having uber buffs cast on my twink, but not as much as
you might think - there is an advantage to the slow but sure method, too.

As an aside: anyone have advice on the best way to get all your weapon
skills up?  Or will I simply have to keep constantly switching weapons as I
level up?
