You should be fine in Thundering Steppes if you are careful to avoid the 
group mobs, and the high conning aggro mobs.  I first went there and 
explored when I was level 13 or so, duoed with a 16 monk to kill solo mobs 
that were red to us.  She was there primarilly to harvest tier 3 nodes, and 
I came along to explore.  Many mobs there will not aggro unless you attack 
them, others will, you just have to be careful.
