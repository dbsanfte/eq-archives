As far as I know, there is no Basra in Syria.  There's a Bosra there, 
though.  I'm quite sure there's a Basra in Iraq.  But no Bosra.

Basrqa is a totally new one on me.

Google to check the -right- spelling. :)

Then, worry about the fact that all the names are transliterations of 
Arabic spellings and we're both probably totally wrong.  Along with the 
rest of the english-speaking world that can't seem to transliterate itself 
out of a paper bag.  Peking?  Beijing?  Let's call the whole thing off!
