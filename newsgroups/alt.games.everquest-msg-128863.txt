Then you aren't reading...  I stated that the +3 str helps from being
unencumberance.  While you take a ding in 8 AC, for some of us, being able
to move or carry a lot helps out, especially if someone plays banker.  But
then, you don't bother to THINK things through when you post

And obviously, you haven't bothered to do serious money hunting either.
You know, those large loads of cash and sellables that will weigh you down.
And yes... 8AC will keep you from being hit as hard, but oops.  Being
overweight drops AC AND AGI...  So I guess being able to run away, while
being quad smacked isn't really important.  And don't bother muttering
about Evac.  Quad smacked makes it difficult to get off a spell, even with
decent channeling.  You are better off running to get more room to cast
than standing there trying to turtle the damage.

Of course any damn Kunark right click armor spell is going to take long.
However, when given only 8 spell gems, and you want to conserve mana, plus
be able to chain cast, the Gauntlets are not that much of a hinderance and
it frees up a spell gem to have something else memmed.

You act as if he is permanently attached to the damn thing.  Gods, you are
an idiot.  Mr. Negative Int won't hurt.  Here's a hint...  Wood Elf Druids
start out, if done the way eq.castersrealm.com suggests, with 75 Cha.  My
druid runs around with the base Cha, and I swap out most of my gear with
Cha gear to sell, which, btw, includes the paw.  Functionality wise, the
paw goes In the bag.  Oh my god....  A stat item going in the bag means...
It doesn't affect my stats!  Meanwhile a -5 save... Since you seem to be
the 'buff' fan as well...  Hmmm...  Since I can boost my strength with
'strength' buffs the druid comes with...  Oh, look here...  Druids also
have 'Resist Disease' too...  Oh... And cure disease spells too.  And what
more... If going against a Non-casting or non-diseasing mob...  One doesn't
take the disease save hit to get better stats when one takes a Wis or other
stat hit to get most of his resist gear up, huh?

Think before you post, Ben...
