Whoa, hold on there.  Originally the entire concept of copyright was
an agreement between the public and the inventor which resulted in a
win-win situation:

1. The inventor received a temporary monopoly - enforced by the
   government - which is funded by the public - which gave the inventor
   time to profit from the work.

2. Upon copyright expiration, the public got the invention as part of
   the public domain in order to encourage the advancement of the public
   good - advancements both in the arts *and* science (arguably computer
   games can fall into both categories).

Copyright was not conceived so that individuals and companies could milk
something for every single penny it was worth.  Software is moving so
rapidly that 20 years may as well be eternity.  In my opinion software
should fall into the public domain sooner.  If it doesn't, the delicate
balance between #1 and #2 above is broken.  The spirit of copyright is
defeated if software only goes into the public domain after it has
become nearly valueless.
