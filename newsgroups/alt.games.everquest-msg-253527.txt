It doesn't increase mitigation, but avoidance.

This isn't due to pet agility, it's due to:

1.  Rathe's Son getting an innate boost in mitigation (from
-5% compared to WoX to +5% compared to WoX)
2.  The addition of +mitigation on pet foci (+10% on DPoC for
mages, +7% on it for BL's, then +2% more for each tier after -
up to a total of +18% for the new GoD one)
3.  The addition of a boost in pet level from foci (+1 from 
DPoC all the way to +5 for the new one that was found recently).

Way down on my list if/when I return.  Pet durability
is way ahead of it, so is the full course of crits, the
full course of SCS and pet fury/alacrity.

Pet affinity is a godsend, and I don't regret getting it for
an instant.
