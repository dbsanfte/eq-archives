I had a thought.

There's a guy on my server with a bad reputation.  He's been in and out of
damn near every guild, and booted out of them all for general assholery. 
But he's a level 60, knows his class really well, and if you didn't know
him, would think he'd be a real asset.  So he gets into a new guild, pulls
his old tricks after a few weeks, gets booted, and the cycle repeats itself.

I'm sure there are multiple people like him on every server.  Nobody likes
them, but they still come in to play.  Too much time invested in the
character to start anew on another server, and if they move, their gear
stays behind.

Until now.

Now he can duck his reputation by going to the Legends server, gear intact. 
So can all of the others like him on all the other servers.

I'm wondering how many of the people moving to Legends are in his situation.
