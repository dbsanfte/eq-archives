No, I feel that the C128 should have run all C64 games, not as an 
emulator, but as a C128, just as my 386 would run all the games (and 
other software) that my 286 ran, and my 486 ran all 386 wares, and my 
pentium ran all 486 wares, and my... continue the logic.

The C64 emulator on the C128 was a huge mistake; the C64 wares didn't 
run in C128, instead the extra cash spent (I never did but a friend did) 
on a C128 was wasted, he just had a more expensive C64 than I did.

Amiga was even worse, not compatible with either of the previous 
machines.  Spend 1000 dollars on software, and hundreds of hours worth 
of data entry getting business information into my C64 spreadsheets etc, 
and if I moved up to an Amiga, I'd have NO software and NO access to my 
data.

Contrast this to the PC upgrade process, where for the most part, buying 
a better machine meant... buying the machine and continuing to use the 
old software and being able to access the old data.  Upgrade software 
and I could move the data up along with; to this day I still have 
spreadsheet data from 1989 that I've ported along what, 8 machines worth 
of upgrades?

Meanwhile, anything I didn't retype manually from my move from the C64 
to PC is just plain lost.

Thats what I said, yes.  Course you  don't need the disk to play, but 
I'd need some way to move it to a hypothetical new machine.
