It isn't that big a jump in skill..more like 5 points (1/2 a level, since a
level gives both weapon skill and offense skill).

It is easy enough. Just plug any set of weapons into copelands with and
without an FBSS...(all done with a L50 warrrior with a base 100 str, 115
with the TBB):

Pair of Yaks:
Nothing: 592 Damage per minute
FBSS: 716
TBB: 596 

Blade of Strategy/Tactics (warrior epic in duel wield form):
Nothing: 860 
FBSS: 1040 
TBB: 867

Jagged blade of war (warrior epic in 2HS form):
Nothing: 831
FBSS: 1006
TBB: 839

Blade of the Black Dragon Eye/Bloodpoint:
Nothing: 890 
FBSS: 1073 
TBB: 897

Willsapper/Blade of the Black Dragon Eye (Between the jaw dropping ratios,
and the incredible usefulness on the proc of both weapons, this is one of
the best combinations you can ever get...the BotBDE no longer drops
however, so it would be a bit hard to come by)
Nothing: 960
FBSS: 1160
TBB: 968

Notice how the TBB is regularly adding a meager and insignificant amount of
damage, where the FBSS is raising it by huge amounts.

>On Bristlebane I can pick a TBB up for 3k and an FBSS for 8k (min)

The TBB is still overpriced at 3k...but the price disparity shows you
roughly the difference in the actual value of the items.
