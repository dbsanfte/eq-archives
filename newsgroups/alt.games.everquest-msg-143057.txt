ACLU:  American Civil Liberties Union, national organization
    which (largely) uses legal resources to advance civil rights.
    Notoriously "liberal," although they've also done things like
    fighting for the right of neo-Nazis to march in a town with a
    large Jewish population.  They're generally "for" things like
    the right to burn the US flag, banning Christmas displays on
    government property, banning school prayer, etc.

NRA:  National Rifle Association, national organization of people
    who support private ownership of gunpowder-based weapons (such
    as rifles, handguns, shotguns, etc.)   Notoriously "right wing"
    due to stances for private ownership of weapons such as full
    automatic rifles and ammunition such as "cop killer" bullets
    (Teflon-coated bullets designed to pierce body armor.)

The ACLU and NRA are both generally portrayed as extremist groups
due to the common "any infringement is a slippery-slope" arguments
on the issues they support.  So you end up with a lot of silly "No,
that Christmas display (paired with a Hanukkah display and a Kwanza
display) are all unconscionable government support of religion"-type
stances from the ACLU and "well, sure, Teflon-coated bullets in full
automatic rifles are extremely powerful weapons with no use outside
killing people, particularly police, but you can't take them away
without taking away the right of a shepherd to have a rifle for
killing wolves hunting his flock"-type arguments from the NRA.

That said, they both do some good, at least in context.  They both
get a lot of bad publicity simply because they're both so wound up
in defending the "letter of the law" that they can't see the "spirit
of the law" anymore.  And, of course, neither group can see that
they often do more harm to their *real* position than good...
