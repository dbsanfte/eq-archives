Make up your mind, is it going down the toilet or is it better?

Ashcroft had his beliefs questioned for good reason.  I certainly am
utterly opposed having the sort of intolerant and hateful policies
championed by so many right-wingers who proclaim themselves to be
"Christian" become the law of the land.  Let's not forget that much of
Jesus teaching is anethema to your typical "conservative" american.
How many right-wingers would "turn the other cheek", "love your
enemy", "sell all that you have and give it to the poor"?  Not only
would they never do any such thing but they routinely proselytize
the reverse.  These folks may call themselves "Christian", but they
go to an awful lot of trouble to distance their own behavior from that
observed and advocated by their namesake.  In modern america "right-
wing Christian" is an oxymoron.
