Hmm, ranger who cast it said he thought it had HP regen.. guess just the
natural troll regen was enough at my level.

The one hour duration is the key part, there are much much better DS's,
but they last such a short time you don't really get much out of them
unless someone is actively hanging about keeping them up on you.  COE you
can get off a ranger in POK (where they can be found hanging out LFG or
LFKEI) and they seem to be happy to be hired to cast somethign instead of
pay pay pay for KEI etc for themselves.
