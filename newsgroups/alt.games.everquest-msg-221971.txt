Oh, I know that Taunt is not the perfect thing we'd like.  But keep in mind
that the Ranger also couldn't pull things off him.  A 2-weapon Ranger should
have little problem getting aggro.

Also, I was unclear in my above-quoted paragraph.  He's self-twinked.  He's
also, I think, self-PLed.  Not as sure about that, but he stated that his
gear was all gained from his other high-level character(s).

Like I said, I've taught other clueless Rogues.  It's not hard to learn the
basics of aggro management.  This nitwit felt that it's not *his* problem,
it's mine.  And I *know* that it isn't, because I've seen people half his
level do far better.

With a Ranger, 2 Wizards, and a Shaman, and sitting in the easiest area in
HH, the rest of the group wasn't going to have problems.  Also, one of the
wizards and the shaman were both easily (and continually) able to grab
aggro.


Miowara's also self-twinked.  My main, Reyder (52 Paladin) got all of
Miowara's armour off rotting corpses in Katta, or bought the occasional
piece from the vendors.  A full suit of Validus Custodes Plate.  Vendors
sell the pieces for about (I seem to recall) 11 Plat per piece.  So, between
the bought pieces and the scavenged, I probably paid out about 5 Plat per
armour location.  Every piece of that armour is Str +, Agi -.  Picked up a
couple of Validus axes for him as well, and he looked pretty sharp.  And
currently has an unbuffed strength of 192.
