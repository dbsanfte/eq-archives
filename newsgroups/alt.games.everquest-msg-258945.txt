I'm pretty sure archery is unlike melee skills in that you can skill
it up on greenies.

Many moons ago I got really lucky around level 45 or so and found a
Tolan's Bracer up for sale at like 2k plat.  (I think they guy priced
it to match other Tolan's gear--helm, vambraces--not realizing what he
had).  I would summon a few hundred arrows and kite down an orc in
Eastern Wastes.  It took, literally, around an hour to kill one.  It
was horribly slow.  But I took archery up from a dismal level to the
max.

Can you still get skillups on Nexus Scions?  They are permarooted,
dont summon, have no faction hits, and if you dont have eq/am3, you
wont be killing them anyway.  (Just make sure you zone before getting
anywhere near her again--she will squish you in melee range)  FYI, I
believe that a Ranger is the only class that can solo a Nexus Scion. 
I did it once...just to say I did it.  It took me a loooooong time.  I
had archery and CF, etc, maxed.  Swifty haste and clicky haste.  It
still took me 1 to 2 hours.  What other class can do that?
