You're missing the point, EQ.

_I_ don't think that Nelson Mandela is a terrorist at all - I plucked
his name out of the air, because he was the leader of a
once-proscribed terrorist organisation, and because I figured
that he would be someone that *you* wouldn't regard as a
terrorist.

My point is that the structure of your argument fails - because
if *you* were trying to argue with someone who thought
Mandela was a terrorist, then you would probably at
some stage find yourself justifying Mandela's actions
and beliefs.

That person could then quite easily use your own argument
against you, saying, in these words "there you go again,
justifying terrorism.  So, you shed no tears on 9/11, right?"

And then, I guess, you'd say exactly what I say - there
is no connection between Mandela and bin Laden.  While
I can justify Mandela's actions, that doesn't mean I
support all terrorists.

It's not the terrorist or otherwise status of Mandela that
is at issue here - it is your idea that justifying the actions
of *any* organisation called "terrorist" means that you
are justifying the actions of *all* terrorists - a confusion
between a particular and a universal argument.

Saying "there are some people whose terrorism is
justified" is entirely different from saying "all
terrorist actions are justified".  (I should know,
because I believe the first statement to be true,
while the second is clearly false)
