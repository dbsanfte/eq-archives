Attunable gear is nice but it still lends itself to major problems with
farming unless it floods the market and the price drops drastically to
where it's not worthwhile to farm it for bazaar sales. I hear it's
already quite bad on most servers in Walls of Slaughter with 100+ people
in there fighting over spawns, training each other and the zone line
constantly. Currently, the nice attunable items are selling for very
nice prices, people seem to look on it like ornate armor, so they aren't
letting the fact it can't be resold bother them when laying out 40-140k
plat for some items dropping in OOW. I've sold 2 ft2 masks with
110hp/mana in the bazaar for 120k pp each and one didnt last on my
vendor more than 3 or 4 hours.
