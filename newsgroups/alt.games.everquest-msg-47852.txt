Level one. Zero experience. However, I did get success failure messages
on all attempts, so I'm not sure what's different here. Maybe just
because it's a racial thing for halflings? In any event, when I tried to
hide, it either said "you failed to hide yourself" or "you have hidden
yourself", or words to that effect. For the sneak attempt, it either
said "you're moving quietly as a herd of elephants" or "you're as quiet
as a cat stalking its prey".
  On a related note, as I posted elsewhere, I went back in and was not
aggro'd by the elementals or golems, and when sneak/hiding was not
attacked by the flyers or the ratmen, so it worked out just fine. Except
I'm stuck in there now and can't get back up the ledge to get back to
the zone.
