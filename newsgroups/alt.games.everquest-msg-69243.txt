It doesn't have to be deeper than that.  To paraphrase a common quote, never
attribute to <what ever...I can't think of the word :) > that can easily be
explained by a programmer who fails to read dox.

I seriously doubt if they thought there was much difference between 8.0a and
8.1...why would there be??

It's true that the game is running somewhat better in 8.1 than 8.0a and that
may be why they decided to use it without bothering to see what 8.1 DIDN'T
support.  I'll grant you that much.

Verant has excellent staff when it comes to making a game.  Crappy staff
when it comes to basic common sense.
