Last night I was with a group of 30's in Rathe (the highest was a 39 druid)
hunting hill giants when out of no where appears this flying Sphinx thing
with a name (don't ask me the name, I had to haul ass to survive, and I
didn't target it just to find out).  It proceeded to cast fear and from what
I gather other spells on my whole party leaving all but two of us dead. I
lived, but that's only because being a lvl 30 I was the lowest level member
of the group and I was with guildmates who gave me their blessing to gate.
So I gated and the other surviving member ran to the zone after taking a
severe beating and had 30 HP of life left (he was a 34 Shadowknight).  My
question is *what* was that thing, what level is it and all the other info
that might go along.  Anyone have any idea, because nobody in the zone
really seemed to know, and the druid that trained him on our party wasn't
talking.  (Note this is NOT a bitchfest about being trained, that's part of
the game, I just want to know what the creature is and what he drops, his
lvl etc.)

Thanks to all civil replies~
