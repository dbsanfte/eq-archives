Why? Is it the player community on Test that is so different? I've
never spent much time on Test except during the LoY beta, when it was
flooded with "proddies", because it's so empty and deserted when I
play, except if I play when the regular servers are down.

My highest level character is 43, but I've basically abandoned him and
now don't really have a main unless you count my trader who is on
almost all the time I'm not playing one of my many alts around level
10.
