IMHO XP is their best effort yet, certainly better than any of their 
other OSes. 2k lacks support for far too much and suffers from virtually 
all the same flaws as XP so its hardly 'better', and 98/ME is flaky 
unsecured junk by comparison.

And bitching about the alt-tab restriction in XP is ridiculous, it was 
in place to prevent crashing EQ. EQ is one of the -very few items- on 
the restricted list that has ever been patched to allow it to alt-tab out.
