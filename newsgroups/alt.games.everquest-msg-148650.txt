I'm just about to ding 14.  I sure hope Healing works alot better than Light
Healing, (I swear rangers have the same heal spell up til then).  Something's
wrong with that!  I am ALWAYS out of mana.  And I am always broke because I
never get to loot because I'm always sitting on my butt.  (This isn't really an
issue yet because I am twinked and my higher characters support this one but
it's GOTTA suck for the "true" newbs.  The "groups" gonna start a minute longer
so I get a chance to loot.  Level 14 spells are around 7 PLAT A PIECE!>)
Do you ask the tanks how many HP's they have so you can determine who to heal
first?  Or heal strickly by the health bar?  
Also, you non warriors that keep getting your butt kicked when we have 3 tanks:
 When I say 20 mana and you get aggro QUIT HITTING!!! Let one of the bigger
tanks get aggro back.  I know you are hitting TAUNT man I am NOT stupid stop
doing that!!
I've been playing with the dervs in West Commons.  Any opinions on where should
I go next?
