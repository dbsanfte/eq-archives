I have done this part of the quest on two characters now.  One took an
active role and wandered up and down the ramp to Kael.  This led to
spawning the Death Squad several times.  Seems if you get down towards
the bottom of the ramp, especially the left side as you go down the odds
of DS popping increase.  After the first few horrors I kept away from
the bottom and the left side entirely and didn't pop them again.

Second time I was playing a druid with tracking.  Was actually just
pulling Walrus and Man O War over near the Kael abyss and noticed the
little bugger pop up on tracking, much easier that way, he was out from
the city no where near the DS goons.
