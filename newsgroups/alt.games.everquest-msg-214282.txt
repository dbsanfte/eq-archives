If soloing is what you want, there are several classes in EQ that excel 
at it.  Necromancers, Druids, Wizards, Shaman, Beastlords, Mages come to 
mind.  There are few classes that are very difficult to solo, and some 
that are somewhere in between.  Many of the classes that are good at 
soloing are also desirable in groups, giving you the best of both worlds.
