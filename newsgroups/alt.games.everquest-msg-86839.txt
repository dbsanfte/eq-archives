    All the newbie classes in Cabilis when Kunark came out had
increasing-power item quests. Monks get Shackles, SKs get the Khurkis (which
now terminate with Greenmist), necromancers get headcaps (the Iksar Hermit
near Lake zone finally has a use, and do NOT prompt him for info unless
doing his quest), shamans get cudgels, and you get your pike. As you get to
further quests, smithing becomes integral. At present, the best pike in the
series is a 12/40 AC 6 Sv. Magic 10 piercer that also can go in the back
slot. Further quests "are planned in the future" - take that for what it's
worth. Warning - the quests are quite obnoxious, if anything like the other
class-specific quests (lots of farming rare drops on rare mobs). They're
listed in the section for East Cabilis on Allakhazam's.

     Also look at http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/qsearch.html?zone=76 -
the listing for your Trooper Scale armour. The Iksar answer to Crafted, most
of the Trooper Scale quests are fun and the armour is as useful as Crafted
(slightly less AC per piece, more stats, you don't get better until Hate).
Although the Allakhazam's walkthroughs do NOT list it, you MUST turn in the
appropriate piece of Banded to the named scorpion-men at the end of each
quest to get the Trooper Scale - another use for smithing.

    If you investigate at EQTraders, you'll find that raising smithing in
Cabilis is pretty easy. So get to it, young hatchling!
