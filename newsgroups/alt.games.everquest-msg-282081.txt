If you can find it, the game is playable with just the main game, but it 
would be just as easy to get one of the many combination versions out 
that which include several or even nearly all of the expansions.  Most 
of the expansions include one thing or another that is handy at low 
levels, and for the most part the combinations are priced the same as 
just the original game.

There's not even any reason to think that EQ2 is going to be coming out 
soon...  Well, ok, there is a game of that name out already of course, 
but its really not what most people think of as a sequel game, rather, 
its pretty much a different game which just happens to share a few names 
of races, creatures, classes and geography.

If "EQ3" comes out in the same vein, it might well be a version of 
Railroad Tycoon only with the steam engines named "Wood elf" and "Vah Shir".

A much more interesting question would be "is there a game coming out 
from the original creator of EQ, using much the same original premise?". 
  Answer to that would be a guarded "yes", you could look into a game 
due to be released sometime (next year?) called Vanguard.  But really, 
that won't be EQ3 (or EQ2) either.
