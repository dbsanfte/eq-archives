I don't think I've ever been in a group that used AoE except for the
occasional AoE mez. I'm itching to try it... supposedly clerics can
sail through 55-60 in AoE groups, but I wouldn't have a clue about how
to find one, and have only some vague speculations on the strategies
involved.

But the cleric/warrior duo will probably kill more quickly than a cleric
and warrior soloing separately. Which is sort of my point; it's easy to
say that for some classes soloing is better exp than grouping, but there
are some cases where it's grossly untrue.

Comparing a cleric+warrior pair with a necro for exp proves nothing about
the weakness of grouping as a strategy, but a great deal about how
pathetic clerics and warriors are at soloing vs. how excellent
necromancers are at it. I don't mind people being good at soloing, but
some attention to balance would be nice.

There's a debate going on on the eqcleric forums at the moment which,
amongst other things, covers the non-uberness of cleric soloing. The
conclusion that seems to be cropping up is that Sony want clerics to
group, not to solo, and making it easier for clerics (and warriors, I
suppose) to solo would disadvantage everybody else.

They also have the disadvantage of stacking poorly; one to a group,
usually, no more but occasionally less. (Paladin/SK as tank;
druid/shaman as healer.) So as a cleric I'm frequently LFG. It tends
to be a feast-or-famine tradeoff - either I get lots of offers or none
at all. I think I was in one exp group last week, and five (one per day)
this week.

So the tradeoff is not nearly as bad as many of those complaining about
*needing* a cleric would suggest.

Compare exp earned by various classes. I made up the numbers. If you don't
like them, make up your own, but the cleric numbers are solid in my
personal experience.

Class           %grouped  exp/hour  %lfg/solo  exp/hour    Avg. exp/hour
Warrior         50        100        50        0           50
Cleric          50        100        50        10          55
Shadowknight    30(*)     100        70        80(*)       86
Paladin         30(**)    100        70        20(**)      44
Druid           20        100        80        150(**)     140
Necro           20        100        80        200(**)     180

(*) Deliberately conservative
(**) WAG (Wild-assed guess) - my lowbie paladin had only about 20% LFG.
    But I'm trying to be conservative here. Frankly from what I've seen
    the percentages may be the other way around, for paladins anyway.

No idea where chanters fall into this. :-) Around the Necro level I suspect.

We really need to put some numbers together... unfortunately this would
need Sony's cooperation, and I doubt that they would help.
