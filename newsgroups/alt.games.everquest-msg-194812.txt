A 6/22 1hs, even with the proc, is not a particularly good weapon for
a L31 Paladin.  Have you done the Ghoulbane quest?  GB is slow, but
it is quite effective at your level:  15/34 proc: Dismiss Undead (I
might be misremembering the name of the proc, it's a 168dd vs. undead).
There are lots of decent 1hs/1hb weapons out there for Paladins, the
only reason I can see for you to use a WotFS would be if you had a
very good weapon (i.e superior to Ghoulbane plus a decent shield) that
used another skill and you just wanted something with a low delay to
use for 1hs skill-ups.

At L31 you won't likely get very good xp hunting most of the drops for
Ghoulbane (everything involved is NODROP and the quest is designed so
that it is impossible to multi-quest it)...

For the piece in BBM there's usually some brain-dead baby dr00d
wannabe camping the crazed Goblins so you'd likely end up just waiting
for the piece to drop (talk nice to the dr00d and he'll likely let you
know when the piece drops so you can loot it when the corpse goes
public), maybe you can find a nearby lowbie to watch over or something
to help pass the time.

In Najena you need to be careful, you can get trapped there so it's
best to go in with somebody familiar with the zone (or with several
people and a good map) so you can recover from an oops.

In Unrest I'm not sure where the ?crazed? ghoul(s) spawn now, they've
moved them several times, but if you go in with a friend or two at
L31 you should be able to get a little xp and maybe some ok vendor
trash (finesteel and bronze) while you're camping the quest drop.
As a bonus you can enjoy being a decent damage dealer via your
Instrument of Nife procs as most mobs there are undead.

In HHK just get in a goblin group in the basement and enjoy the xp.
Be sure to let your groupmates know that you're after the quest
drop.

Check http://everquest.allakhazam.com for details on the quest, and
good luck!
