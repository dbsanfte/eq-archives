I take it you never played UO in its heyday. PvP, or rather PK'ing was on
all shards, and most people didn't like it. It did add an element of danger,
which is now sadly lacking, but the problem was finding people who wanted to
be victims.

The problem here, is how tenacious grief players, are in their pursuit of
causing grief. If they can cause grief to another player, then their life in
Norrath doesn't become "a very restricted and unappealing one", it becomes a
very satisfying one.

How would you stop friends of the murderer assisting them? It would seem to
be impossible to stop a friend from giving out information to the murderer.
And that is only the bottom of the scale in aiding and abetting. Would
friends be able to heal or buff or rez the murderer?

Another idea that was implemented in UO, the result being that the head was
turned in by friends of the deceased, and they then shared the reward. This,
in effect, encouraged the player to make the bounty on his head, as high as
possible.

I think

I agree, but I don't think EQ can ever be coded to implement it effectively.

 And also, it would do away with

I can see this as an opportunity for the beggars to cause more grief, than
they already do.

I admire the sentiments. There is certain thrill from fighting another
player, that you cant reproduce when fighting against computer generated
foes.

I don't think it will happen in EQ, though I do think that it is the future
of online gaming.
