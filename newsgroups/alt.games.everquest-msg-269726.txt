According to this post on the official forums:
http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2/board/message?board.id=news_announcements&message.id=28

you can get an extra four slots by signing up for a Station Access subscription
($21.99 p/m), which also gets you all the other games from SOE.

So everyone who predicted this, you were right - they're trying to get
alt-oholics to fork out more cash.
