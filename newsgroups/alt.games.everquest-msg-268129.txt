When you turn on the roleplay flag, others can no longer see your
class unless you're in their group, which means you have to ask them
what class they are if you see them show up as LFG.  If you advertise
your skills that's not a problem, but when someone is looking for more
people for their group the roleplayers will probably be last on the
list since it's extra hassle.
