    I am now a LV18 Barbarian Warrior and would like to see more of Norath,
but be SAFE about it to.  I'd like to find an area where I can explore
safely, but also it would be nice to be able to do some hunting (not camping
unless its reasonably easy, (meaning safe, not safe as long as you stay away
from.... or as long as you don't....., normal safe hunting, like the orcs or
dervs, can usually take on a single one (non caster) no problem) likely to
be solo.  I'd like to hunt, get some EXP, decent loot for my hunting, and
would like to be a place where I'm not worried about faction (no dubious
unless its quick or at least easy to raise, apprehensive or better is
preferred, but not absolutely required, KOS is out of the question however
at this moment unless again pretty easy and quick and SAFE to get out of
KOSness).  I'd want to be near (zone or two, maybe three if safe to travel
naked at my LV) a place I can be bound to.  I'd really need to be able to
bank there, and buy/sell too.  Once again I'm a Barbarian Warrior, 1 blue
bubble above 18, wearing mostly bronze armor (need to let off some luggage
because 2 rusty weapons and I'm over weight by 1 or 2 WT).  And again due to
the time of night/day I'm able to get on I'd likely end up soloing.  I'd
mainly like to see and experience new places.  I've been all over Antonica
(all but deep into Guk and just ran through Rathe Mountains), and been to
the Eastern few zones of that dwarf/wood elf continent, and been to the wood
elf platform home place (that's about as far West).  I've played an Iksar SK
to LV12 so I've seen the 4 newbie zones surrounding the Iksar city, and took
my Halfling Druid there on a corpse run to go invis and rescue my lizard who
was being camped by some higher LV goblins and skeletons.  I've thought
about the new zone, but haven't seen much info on it.  Can I be bound in
paineel (and get there easily)?  I've considered binding there, /duel and
die, leave corpse at top, get one copper (need something on body) and then
take the 10K fall just for fun (never done that before).  Any good, safe,
fun, places to explore, minor hunting and looting, at my LV?

just hit LV18 Barbarian Warrior from ice country who's butt is currently
buried in sand of Ro.
