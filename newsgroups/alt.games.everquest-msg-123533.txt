In addition to your normal friends make sure to ask pick up groups if anyone
has spare pages, and most pick up groups won't mind you hoarding all the
pages... need before greed

Hate to say this... but awsome idea... ALSO... my habit is to also give
Clerics clarity every chance you get.. I don't know about you but at 54 atm
and I think I've died more than most ppl I know... as time goes by and I
befriend more and more clerics, I get more and more Free 49, 56 rezzes...
you never know when the cleric you kept claritied will be free to hook you
up with a rez

Find out which guildee's have alt chanters... especially higher level
alts... I've gotten so many spells/spell components from ppl who collected
parts for alts, got the spells, and then never used the extra parts... :)
good friend of mine kept me with ever spell I needed as I leveled until 49.
He had a higher level chanter main until about 48-49 when I think I passed
him... haven't seen him in awhile tho so I'm not sure

Just remember... you like it when someone says thank you for crack...
carma... what goes around comes around... make sure to tell ppl thank you
for the hook ups.. goes especially well with the free crack for clerics
thing I mentioned earlier :) God I love clerics :) hehe
