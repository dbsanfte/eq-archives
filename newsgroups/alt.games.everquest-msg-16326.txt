I have tried to find this info, if someone knows a web site where I can find
the answer, I'd appreciate it. My question is, how do you improve Fishing
skill other than just plain fishing? I thought I had heard/read that if you
use diff types of bait you can increase your skills. I am 23 or 24 in
Fishing and I can make a profit fishing. I was just wondering if there was a
limit in increasing the skill if just using the plain old bait I get from
the Port Authority. Thanks in advance for any help.
