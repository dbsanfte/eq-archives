That didn't explain anything other than the fact that the people involved 
were in a guild that wasn't interested in their getting flagged.

= bad guild

Each problem I've read of here basically stems from guild members getting 
flagged and then taking off for the higher content. If there is more to it 
than that, I'd like to hear it.

I *do* understand how the required DPS for the encounter is support class 
prohibitive. That *is* a problem. That does *not* mean that the trial 
should not be required, just that it should be fixed.
