I have to disagree.  For mezzes it's pretty critical.  In some cases,
people don't even notice that there is an add.  Not necessarily
because they are crummy players, but due to lag or strange pathing or
whatever.  Also, it's not unusual that a mob will appear to continue
to move or attack after I've mezzed it. The last thing I need is
someone deciding to "off-tank" (my least favorite word) right as my
mez lands.

 I'll usually use my macro key the first time and then silently remez
if necessary, but if we get lots of adds, and I think that the tank or
puller has lost track of the count, I'll announce remezzes as well.
Keeping track of crowd control is absolutely critical.

I agree that using macros to announce bufs or slows is generally not
necessary, EXCEPT when you have multiple group members who can perform
the same task.  Example: my chanter normally slows, but if we get
multiples it's way more critical to mez the adds than to slow one of
them.  So in that case the beast or shammy can slow.  Announcing the
slows avoids wasting mana.

If you have all of your group talk in a separate window, you shouldn't
be seeing a whole lot of spam anyway, so I'm not sure why this is such
a big issue for people.
