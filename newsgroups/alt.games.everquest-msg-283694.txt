Hmm, I'll have to experiment with that.  At the moment, I wasn't doing 
any attacking, so it wasn't important.  After years of playing 
caster/healer types, I don't have the "attack when attacked" setting on, 
I have to manually turn attack on for each new target.  Sounds like 
doing the same would be crucial for a monk, and perhaps for a SK/Necro 
if it works the same for us.

Right, that happened to me in my little experiment run.  Very pesky 
because I had to wait for the feign button to cycle back up.

I got that message a few times, and figured thats what it was about, 
kind of remembered it from hanging out with monk friends in the past. 
Worst part is that although the feign has failed to fool anyone, I'm 
nonetheless just lying there motionless!  Definately have to increase 
the warning level for that, perhaps audio triggers are the way to go, as 
you suggest.

Yeah, I was definately doing that here, I grew up as a cleric, so 
laoding DA the instant I woke up was one of the "must do" things.  FD 
seems like a far far better version of DA in most ways, not least of 
which is the shorter cycle time.

I knew that, and that Slows get cured with cure disease.  Couldn't 
remember what took Mala off though, and sort of hoped disease.  Guess 
its a curse.

I won't be dead, which is nice, but will I be FD'd?  Even if I'm not, if 
I'm back up to FM and FHP, I could continue the experiment.  It did 
occur to me that the "return home" option would be there, too.  Its good 
to have options, but my current intent is still to abandon toon, he's 
just an experiment.  Might be worth picking him back up just to try the 
rest of that trip down the shaft, though :)

Is there some way I can audio trigger that one too?  So I can duck out 
from under if I've started casting, and not blow a whole cycle.  Another 
option would be to put "others' casting on you" or whatever its called 
messages into a seperate window.

Yep, definately need more experience with this.  It seems to me SK FD 
isn't as reliable as monk FD, in that there's mana and fizzling and 
casting time to consider, in addition to the normal ways things can go 
wrong with it.  But still, a nice ability to have, and to try and figure 
out how to use well.

Ah, that will be a sad day.  I was going to say "not with full pet toy 
gear and buffs" but then, if I have a pet like that, I'm going to be 
pretty upset about burning him just to FD past trouble.

Not till 30.  Yes, FD plus Invis will be a big improvement, even if I 
get an invis fail, I can hopefully get to a safe position, FD, then 
recast GS to start over.  There's invis in a bottle even now, and if I 
really had to travel somewhere odd like this, I'd be using that, instead 
of trying to iron man it down using nothing but straight FD.

Yeah, I've done that.  I've even done it without FD, just running all 
the way to the guards (and making several laps around town till the 
guards clean up all the orcs).  But what fun would that be?
