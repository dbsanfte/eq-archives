I guess you missed the part where Uberbooger there says he is a 12th level
Druid.  But seriously, Ubergoober can't exactly purposely try and screw
over another group, nor can he stake a claim on any mob according to the
PNP...  Camping is not really officially recognized as part of the Play
Nice Policy.  Players have the right to 'camp' there as well, so long as
they are not preventing you from getting a chance at getting the mob as
well.
