Thats not what I said; I said there was no core function. The only
reason other classes are not used for ghetto crowd control is because
they can do other things more usefully. It is not something unique
to, or amazing about rangers in particular.

Monks, by contrast, offer 2 things *every* raid, as far as I can
see - superior (to rangers) DPS, and great pulling. Have you replaced
monk pulling with rogues or something ?

'up to' is a useful caveat; I parsed on the avatar of the elements
last time we did time for you - a noticably low AC mob and thus one
that gives good results for archery. I'm maxed worn ATK, parsed
375dps. Archery conditions were pretty much perfect.

Maybe I'm mistaken, but I was under the impression warriors had
gained an immune to all attacks thingy with the melee balancing
that took place once they canned the openings system - certainly
our warriors say 'I'll do weaponshield' now.

You know who ;) Bards and Monks. FD, fading memories and indoor
lull are pretty hard to beat ;) I'm not suggesting the 'puller
role' needs to be more crowded, nor that the DPS role does
really. Just that I'd like to see a more defined role for rangers
that made them something genuinely great to have along, rather
than something mandated by 'use this class to kill this content
or you wont get by' riddle-hacks.

Hm. Im not sure how really; even a rogue using only dagger of
distraction and EOE parsed 427 DPS on the rocks... I dont see how
a god/time dagger geared rogue could be parsing under 370.

Yeah, maybe that was - word of mouth from my friends in our 'uber
guild' who are deep in GOD was that their rogues were doing just
that. I had assumed it was because of the sheer power of GOD weaponry,
but it may well be archery mitigating GOD mobs that were responsible.
I'll think more before I make such a broad assertion next time.

Nonetheless; I would like to see my mana useful for something and
the ability to consistently outdamage tank classes in standard melee
if the 'role' of a ranger on raids is supposedly DPS, or I'd like
some genuinely more distinct and useful utility functionality, that
stacks, if its not.

I have this big bundle of mana. I'd like something to do with it ;)

Matt
