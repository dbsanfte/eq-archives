There is only one Spyware program I like, and that I recommend to my
friends who may not be confortable with editing a registry.

I like Ad Aware, you can get it at: www.lavasoft.nu

The OP's complaints sounds exactly like a spyware infestation. A lot
of EQ boards have spyware platforms from the ad agencies they use. I
also recommend making Active-X embedded controls on page a prompt and
not automatically run. One advantage from that is some popups spawn
other popups when you close them, and canning the Active-X controls
make the popups not spawn other popups.
