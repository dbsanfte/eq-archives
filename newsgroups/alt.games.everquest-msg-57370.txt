And you're a Paladin why?

Ah, yes, of course.

You're a "paladin of convenience".  You have no idea what being a
Paladin is about.  If the game actually was able to support the
Paladin class correctly, you and all the rest wouldn't exist.  You'd
find the class to be far too restrictive and hard.

Attacking at the wedding?  Improper but effective.  A Paladin, lying
to your own guild?  You're scum, pure and simple.
