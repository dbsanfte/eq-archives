    Actually, they must be talking about raids. You sure don't go OOM that
often in an XP group.

    If you didn't require over 200 WIS to do your job before, raising the
cap to 255 won't change a thing. It helps raid-oriented clerics, who do go
OOM and who generally evaporate if they attract aggro anyways (doing AoW on
the weekend may be colouring my view here), but for XP groups it's all about
mana regen rate vs. mana cost per unit time.
