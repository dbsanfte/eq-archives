In my 3 plus years of playing a druid, I have very rarely found
creatures that couldn't be snared.  I know there are more now with
Luclin, such as the sonic wolves, but they still can't outrun SoW.

And if I'm hunting solo, I'm almost always in Wolfform.  Faster than
SoW.  No slowdown at low health.  Longer duration.

I'd say that 10 minute snare is infinitely more useful to druids than
SoC could ever want to be.
