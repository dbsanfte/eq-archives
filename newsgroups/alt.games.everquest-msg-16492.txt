I have seen a lot of people that focus all out on the video, ram, and CPU,
and forget the hard drive.

Had a friend with a 4000 RPM Quantum Bigfoot drive.  Her system was zone
crash crazy.  Getting some tips from power gamers, I changed her up to a
7200 RPM IBM Deskstar, which her system accesses with ATA 66.  Zone crashing
disappeared.

EQ is no where near as Processor and Video intensive as most first person
games.  Yes, Lucin is slated to change that.  But what EQ does do that most
the others do not is a heck of a lot of drive cashing.  This is why many
people report improvements in crashing when they do a defrag.

What are the specs on your HD?  Is it 7200 RPM, ATA 66 or ATA 100?  If not,
you might want to look into something better and see if it helps.

I have 2 machines that are very similar.  One has a slower processor, but
better video card.  However, the other "faster" machine still has a 5400 RPM
drive.  They use the same DSL connection.  My roommate also has 2 machines.
One of his has a 5400 RPM drive.  Of the four machines, the ones with 5400
RPM drives zone MUCH slower, and crash much more often.

The only exception to the rule is one machine has an ATi Radion 32 DDR.
This causes video crashes at least once a week, and is very annoying.
Before the ATi patch it was at least once a day, and many times I crashed
out repeatedly.  A green bar would be across the top of the screen, which is
an indication of a video error.

A few other tips on hard drives:  Having slower devices on an ATAPI bus can
slow down the whole buss.  So putting your CD as a slave off your HD can
slow down the transfers to and from the HD.  Western Digital's quality has
slowly been going down, and Maxtor's going up.  The reverse of this used to
be true.  Right now IBM beats them both quality wise, but does not have a
drive cloning utility that I could find, making upgrades harder.  Drives
over 32GB have a whole new set of issues, and require BIOS extensions in
many machines.  This may even happen after patching the BIOS.  Do I would
avoid greater than 32 GB drives for performance reasons.
