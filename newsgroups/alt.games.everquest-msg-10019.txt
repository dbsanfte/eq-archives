I understand your point.  And I take it you already know it looks like a
tuning fork ;)

1) It's cheap because it's farmed to death...crystal caverns as I recall.
Feel free to correct me there.

2) Paladin's suck at pierce and have yet to realize how many *awesome*
piercing weapons are out there and/or are loathe to admit that they kick ass
over their current 2h weap.  Same thing happened when decent blunt
monk/war/etc weapons started showing up.

3) If the 'look' of a weap prevents you from using it to deal much greater
damage, please stop playing EQ. :)
