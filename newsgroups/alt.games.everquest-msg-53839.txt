Happens all the time in Oasis. Damn bug. The mob warped back to it's spawn
point.

No idea. The weirdest thing to happen to me was see my Druid (17 at the
time) fighting orcs in Highpass get dangerously close to death and barely
made it to zone. (As in, less than 20hp left out of 400+) When I zoned to
Kith a few things were odd. First, all my buffs were gone, as if I had
died and respawned. For a split second I thought I had been killed. Then I
saw all my spell gems still memorized and -then- it clicked what what was
beyond the spell gems on my screen was not the town of Freeport (my 
bind) nor the HHP entrance to Kith, which is what should have been
there... instead I was looking at the entrance to Rivervale. Talk about a
warp...
