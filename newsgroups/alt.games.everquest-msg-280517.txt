>All I want to do is 2-box on one PC...

I play on my homebrew box.  It's loaded with an Abit 800FSB motherboard, a 3.0GHz
Northwood, and a gig of matched Crucial DDR400 memory. 

To that I added my existing stuff: a PC Power & Cooling Silencer 400w power supply, a pair
of 80GB 7200RPM 8MB disks, a 16x DVD-+R, an Audigy 2, and the icing on the cake, a BFG
GeForce 6800 GT OC 256MB AGP vidcard. 

The disks are in a RAID-0 array through Abit SERILLEL2 PATA>SATA adapters. The RAID
controller is built into the Northbridge chip. The DVD--+R is on the Intel PATA
controller. 

The CPU is cooled with a Zalman CNPS7700-Cu and Arctic Silver 5. The NB is passively
cooled with a Zalman ZM-NB47J and Arctic Silver Thermal Epoxy. The insanely noisy dual-fan
cooler on the BFG vidcard was replaced with an Arctic Cooling NV Silencer 5. 

Net-net? 4 instances of EQ on the same box, windowed, with no perceptible lag except in
PoK, and it's so quiet that you can't really hear the thing running.

Total cost for the new components? About $780. Figure another $600 for the existing case,
vidcard, power supply, DVD-+R, floppy, and Audigy 2.

>I plan to run each instance of EQ from a seperate EQ directorie...

Why go to the trouble of separate directories?  I run all 4 instances from a single
directory without suffering any ill effects.

>...with the second instance having all eye candy and sound turned off.

I do not have to choke my settings at all on any instance.  I normally restrict spells to
My/NPC, but that's just to keep all the blinky lights from obscuring my view :>

>I want to run them both full-screen (not a window that covers the whole screen)...

You'll have to run all of your instances in a window, but CoolSwitch (aka ALT-TAB) is all
you'll need to get from window to window.  Instantly.

A couple of caveats:

1> Zoning takes FOREVER, at least 3x as long as when single-instancing.  I attribute this
to disk activity.

2> As experienced as I am, I will not drive more than 1 toon on a raid.  I am not going to
be the one who blows a CH chain because I'm looking at the wrong screen at the wrong
moment.  I can, however, drive 3 instances very well when soloing, and I've managed to
pull off a few Adventures and Expeditions when 2-boxing.  But the last time I tried to
drive 2 toons in The Hole, it was uuuuugly.  Bad things were running at our 14-person raid
too fast for me to keep up...which is bad news when you're driving the only melee and
healer in the group 8!
