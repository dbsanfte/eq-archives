True, though at 60, you should seriously outclass the ZI frogs, and 
could probably forego those buffs, especially if single pulling them.

A strategy for dealing with runners is to pull two at a time and root 
park one (or mez if you have it - which you don't, but I mention it for 
completeness). This prevents them from running. Similiarly you can fight 
near un aggroed mob (as the ZI mobs come in pairs for the first few. And 
refresh Pac during the fight to keep it from gettin involved. Generally 
if you fight close enough to another mob, the one you are fighting won't 
run. Its a bit riskier as you will occasionally deal with root breaks or 
paci-resists etc, and will be fighting 2, but if you outclass the mobs 
enough it works very well. (If you outclass them too much they'll run 
anyway in many cases...don't know about OS in particular)

Pulling the first 8 - 12 mobs is pretty trivial with Pacify. Once you 
pass the spiders things can get hairy.

The CR itself is another consideration... if you don't think Divine Aura 
and LoH are going to get you to the zone out (e.g. you're snared), then 
play it safe and die at the zone in. The last thing you want is a CR 
that requires you get 'close' to the Zone Out. Its brutal, many mobs see 
invis, and in a few places are fairly tightly packed. You may even want 
to bring a gate item instead of risking the trip to the zone out.

To top it off OS seems to be pretty terrible XP. I was hunting the ZI 
mobs with a holy trinity trio at ~50 and xp was slow slogging even then. 
At 60 solo (read: with downtime)... well... yuck...

Yep.
