    Hot chocolate would be made in a brew 
barrel, silly.  What, you make your hot
chocolate on a *spit* in your house?  Sheesh.
    And we could use brewed products in
cooking, too.  A chunk of meat, some 
foraged veggies, some red wine, and 
spices in a pot on a spit, and you
got yourself a damned fine burgandy 
beef!
