Yep, I was on for a bit on Druzzil Ro. Only guy there for like 15min.
Anyways, different races result in different wolf colours. Woodelf was
white, halfling <me> was brown, and the dark elf I wolfed was a black wolf.
Probably be the same with Bear form.

All the elementals i saw were old school though. And the scalebones in
kunark were old as well.
