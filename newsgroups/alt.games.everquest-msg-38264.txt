Subject: VI to hide server poulations at login screen

As many of you have noticed, soon we will be removing the population numbers
from the server selection screen, as well as our web site and our fan sites. We
will also be disabling the ability to use /w all in the game (which has the
side benefit of reducing the load on our servers a little bit).

"Due to the increasing amount of competition in the online gaming space we feel
that it's not in our best interests as a company to provide our existing and
future competitors with valuable information on our userbase. We have always
had a very open stance on the issue of what our numbers are specifically, but
as we grow in other markets around the world this information is simply not
something our competition needs to know."

- John Smedley

If Vi is so concerned about competiton all of a sudden  maybe they should
improve customer service first
