Actually, I'd play on one of those laptops that have either the Geforce 
Go or the ATI Mobility 7500 video chip.  It would be awesome for road 
trips that happen frequently at my work.

IMHO, you're wrong about LCDs as a whole not being ready for gaming. 
Some, perhaps, but my two Samsung 15" SyncMaster TFT displays have 
proven their worth.  I've played UT, Q3A, and fast driving games (NFS, 
Motoracer, etc.) with these displays, and they look wonderful.  I can 
see everything with no image blurs.
