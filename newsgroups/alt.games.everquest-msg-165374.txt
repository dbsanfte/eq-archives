    We were clearing VT last night on a lark, and boy was it easy - even
with them restoring what mobs can/cannot be mezzed. I must admit though, I
did die once - when the zone crashed after we killed a boss, and I logged
back in to six angry mobs. I almost got off Gate after DA'ing to mem it,
too. =/

    We also recently did Kael for kicks, and to gear up a few newer members.
39 person raid, Vindi-Statue-Idol-AoW down in 49 minutes. Getting six 100 HP
melee items in 49 minutes is the sort of risk-reward I like! ;-) And there
was some tension - our 5 clerics were nearly OOM when he went down!
