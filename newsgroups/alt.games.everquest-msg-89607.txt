You keep on about more customer service...

Pay for Legends.  Sign up and play.  There will be more GMs on that server.
As for losing customers, throwing money down the drain isn't smart trying to
retain business.  If you have good CS staff but not enough -- hire more?
With what funds?  The game makes money.  The money is allocated to different
uses.  If there is extra, use it.  If not, don't.  Simple business rules.

To address the CS issues they come up with a more expensive premium
membership.  see if it catches on.  If so, you now have the funding to
improve CS for the premium customers.  If it doesn't catch on then folks
will either live with what they have or move on.

I read their add for legends.  Simply put it's a final beta server (for "new
legends equipment that MAY go public") that will have a lot more customer
service folks around (thus the premium costs) and that offers a web page to
show off your character (woopie...  how much disk space and bandwidth can
that chew up?).  Biggest point is the increased number of GM's to "run event
s" but also to handle Customer Service issues...
