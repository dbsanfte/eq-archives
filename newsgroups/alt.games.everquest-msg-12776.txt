Playing with them isn't an option for all classes though.  As a Magician,
I'm not sure what I could to to a newbie in a duel that wouldn't be fatal
at some point, other than telling them have 30 seconds to beat feet before
I put Goner the level 27 Fire Elemental down their shorts.  Enchanters have
a lot more options for messing with somebodies head.  I've heard Charm has
lots of applications for this.  (Just don't make them suicide on a guard,
that's considered a booting offense at least, and is probably bannable.) 
Making them follow you around and chant "My leader is XXX" is fine though,
as it making them do Elemental Calesthenics.  "Pet sit down.  Pet stand
up.  Pet guard here.  Pet follow me.  Pet, who is the master?"  Repeat
until it stops being funny.  : )

This one only works on the clueless though.  In my experience, the most
annoying beggars are l33T DeWdZ who just made a twink and expect somebody
else to finish funding the twinkage.  They aren't clueless, they're just
stupid and/or rude.  If I'm not near a guard, I'll just target them and hit
my "pet attack" button, since I've added a social emote like "X points at
Targetname and orders Petname to kill him/her/it."  With all the new %T
items, it works pretty well, even if the pet does follow the order with
"That is not a valid target, Master."  If there's a guard around, I'll
usually just tell them to pike off.
