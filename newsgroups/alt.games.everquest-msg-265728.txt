If interactivity is lost, the worldy aspect goes with it.

It's loot that isn't on the cutting edge but is still acceptable for
the level. In post-PoP pre-GoD terms, cultural armor would be low end
average loot for a L65. Ornate would be moderate average loot. Thurg
quest armor would be unacceptable level. Elemental would be cutting
edge.

Work towards upgrades? Help others to do so? Have fun just playing,
grinding aa? Challenge yourself? Explore? Roleplay?

As long as the accomplishment vs reward is maintained, it doesn't
matter. One might be dead, or otherwise unavailable. What you are
suggesting is in fact exactly what instancing provides - go get your
loot from the one encounter you already know, to hell with any others.
LDoN proved that in spades.

But Y and Z are just as good as X. Your complaint is that you want to
go to X and despite Y and Z being completely servicable alternatives
when there are people in X you still demand X all to yourself?

You SURE its not because X is more convenient? Seems to me the vast
majority of players would be choosing on that standard, not yours.

As heroic as anything in these mmorpgs. If that is your standard, how
heroic is doing the exact same adventure you know you can beat (you
know because you aren't vulnerable to the unpredictable behavior of
OTHER PEOPLE, other than your group) over and over until you get some
piece of loot from a vendor?

Or how about the heroism of being able to come to someone's rescue
when they get overmatched? Kinda missing when you can't come into
their pocket dimension....

Heroism has nothing to do with it if there is enough content to spread
around. Your problem is you're trying to foist your non-heroic style
of gaming onto non-instancing dungeons and then complaining that it
isn't heroic.

Instead of pretending that you are a hero in a single player or single
group game, accept that these worlds are full of heroes and adapt. Or,
don't. NWN sounds more up your ally, you get to be the sole hero in
that game. Or Morrowind. And you'll never have to deal with those
pesky "other people" who you don't accept are also heroes in the same
world.

Welcome to playing in a world. Single player / single group games are
*that* way. The fact that games like EQ and especially the way it is
now along with the games developed on the same line make very poor
world does not invalidate the concept. UO is seven years old and still
has something like 150k subscribers and it works very much more like a
real "world" even with the Trammel baloney. Obviously there is
something to interaction beyond the chat lobby.

Gamey. Not a world. NWN is *that* way.
