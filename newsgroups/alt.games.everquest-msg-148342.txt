    Yes, it says that the average player won't look for a good place to solo
or group. Rather, they'll go wherever it's "good" to go. Part of that is the
group nature of the game - you have to be where other people are if you want
in a pickup group. But part of it is people THINKING that "I can only go
here, everything else is too tough or someone would have mentioned it as
being good".

    How many people do you know that did AoE on Shadow Haven guards? Triton
did it after the XP patch, got an AA point EVERY 20 MINUTES, and got the
entire thing nerfed because of how good it was. I doubt they've nerfed
Mother Fordel, the level 70 NPC in Shadow Haven with 32 K HPs, hits in the
low 100's and is soloable by a guild paladin. Oh, and she respawns fast,
too. It's just that nobody ever bothered to try and kill these NPCs for XP.
I've seen many places just like this, with piles of mobs waiting to be
killed, but nobody goes there because.... nobody goes there.

    Or people are unwilling to look through the zone and see if any "sweet
spots" exist. Ask Graeme about the spawn of spiders in Nurga he used to
solo. But nobody does Nurga because it's too tough, riiiight?

    You mean made easier? Ignoring individual boss mob adjustments, and
adjustments that come from other changes (like the resist patch):

-removal of pets from mage mobs in Hate
-removal of the AoE from bottom floor goos in Dalnir
-the raising of the levels of all Velk's spiders without increasing their
difficulty (also itemized them)
-adding of acrylia drops to several non-Grimling mobs throughout Luclin
(Luclin tailoring was made MUCH easier by this)

    There's one per expansion. Need more?

    The resist change made them slowable. So instead (in Emperor's case) of
the mob being 25% slowable, it was 70% slowable. The zone was also lagged to
hell and back in such a way that the mob's actual damage output was reduced
further. It took what was supposed to be the final fight for entry into Vex
Thal, the Luclin end-game zone, and made it damn-near trivial to anyone
capable of getting there.
