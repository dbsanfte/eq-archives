The Goblins have the added bonus of also raising faction
with the Dwarf Guards, possibly opening up the port of
Butcherblock for a non porter to actually take the boat
without having to swim etc.

As for raising faction with the Warriors and SK guilds, I
think most quests will destroy your hard earned faction with
the halflings.  

You should be able to train/buy spells in EFP, Grobb, Ogguk,
Qeynos Catacombs, and with some faction work (killing
Kobolds like crazy in Warrens, Paineel.
