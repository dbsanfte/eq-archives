Uhh that turns Umbra off but is a fairly bad test of whether
or not Umbra is screwing you up. In order to test this you'd have to
try it with both of those set to true then only turn UseTnl to false,
then restart EQ again and see what that did. Then you'd have to change
UseTnl to true and useumbra=false and start EQ again and see what that
did.

They fixed umbra after dec 4 and it is definately working for most
people.
Currently if you have useumbra=false change it to true (important 
thing is that its not saying false, or just remove it)

I found 

UseUmbra=TRUE

so it was no longer saying false, improved the game greatly for me
once it worked. The best place to see if it is working is somewhere in
luclin such as shadowhaven. Umbra works hand in hand with the 
clip plane to render only what you see. The problem in old world
cities, like Freeport, is that the clip plane does absolutely nothing.
You see just as far in freeport with the clipping all the way in or
all the way out. Umbra is not going to help in that situation very
much. It helps a lot in somewhere like shadowhaven if you turn
clipping down. Once they had umbra working my vah shir could
finally go back to shar vahl because it was able to move there
finally.

A good test if umbra is working is to use something like Fraps, a
directX fullscreen game frame rate tester. I was using this first with
umbra then with umbra set to false (requires you completely leave 
the game and restart it after changing the eqclient.ini.) I found that
with clipping all the way out, I was slow with or without Umbra
enabled (since umbra is rendering everything you see which is shadow
haven is quite a lot) and I was getting about 2 fps. If I then went in
a room with four walls, with Umbra enabled, I rocket back up to 30
fps. With UseUmbra=False even in that room i was still getting 2 fps.
That is exactly what umbra does, it renders only what you see where as
without it you are rendering everything around whether you can see it
or not. So now I make sure Umbra is not disabled, move clipping out
only a few notches and I can run through shadowhaven or shar vahl
pretty rapidly.

Umbra has improved the game for me a lot, I'm on a p2 400, tnt 16 meg
agp card, 576 meg of ram. I have all luclin models enabled and the
animations. The only time I have trouble is when I'm in EC tunnel or
something and 30 people are there, then if I just look towards the
wall more I'm fine.
