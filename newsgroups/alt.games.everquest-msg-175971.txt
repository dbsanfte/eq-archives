One other thing I haven't seen mentioned yet is that, at least in the
case of *some* NPC's, you must have the NPC targeted when you "/say" the
key phrase. Just saying it with yourself or nothing targeted in their
vicinity won't always work.  Found this out the hard way once when the
Coldain Prayer Shawl guy in Thurgadin got bugged concerning that after a
patch. Formerly you had to target him, then suddenly he wouldn't
respond. Turned out you had to target *yourself* and say the phrase,
then he would answer. Fortunately, enough people /bug'd that one and it
was fixed a couple patches later.
