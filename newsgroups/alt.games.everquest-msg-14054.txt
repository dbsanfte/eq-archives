Personally I think they just looked at their CS workload and thought "screw
it". I know a few people who have had their accounts tampered with (guess
what - they lent out their passwords heh) and in each case they pursued the
GMs and other Verant staff for 3 or more weeks (to no avail but hey). One of
the accounts in question _had_ been transferred previously. So, given that
this sort of thing is probably happening to a few-dozen people per server,
and each of them is hassling CS staff for _weeks_ over it (checking the
stories, examining the accounts, going through item histories, emails,
telephone calls yadda yadda) you can imagine the workload this phenomenon is
causing. So I think Verant said "screw this, just ban 'em all". It's a
pretty hardline stance but understandable given their position on account
security. That, and the amount of CS they were forking out to these people
for a mere $9.89 a month.
It's far from an ideal or perfect solution, but it's _enough_ of a solution
given the piffling amount of money we pay to play. IMHO anyway.
