For sheer fun, my friend and I play a couple of Beastlords, and find
we have a blast with them, so, bearing in mind your criteria, try two
of those.  They are fun solo and in a group, even at low levels.

With the two pets and our (rudimentary) heals/bandages we used to do
very well anyway, even under lvl 20, but nowadays we also have the
Healing/Clarity potions to keep us tanking even longer between meds.
  
For extra effectiveness, bum or buy a couple of suits of Summoned
Plate Armour for the pets, then when they can use pet toys, hit the
Bazaar and get the pets a couple of Hands of Ixiblat apiece and maybe
a Crystal Belt (for the extra hp on those) and the pets are quite
formidable!

We like all our other alts, admittedly, but when we want to kick back
and just have fun, we load up the Beastlords.
