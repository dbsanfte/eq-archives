I've been using LCD display for quite a while, have a KDS Rad-17
display for about 2 years now and haven't noticed any ghosting or any
issue.  The only major issue is the contrast ratio but that's
generally an issue if multiple players shares the same monitor (ie
Monopoly board game) but for single player not a problem.

I also have another LCD display, HP Pavilion f50 that came with an HP
computer.  It plays OK but the midrange color's really bad looking and
kind of washed out. ie where it should be medium cyan I see neon
blue-green and adjusting brightness/gamma has no effect.  Darker color
and lighter color's fine just the mid range color that is too light.
