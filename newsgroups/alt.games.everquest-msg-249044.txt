You are wrong. The US are signatories to those relevant conventions. That is
why Amnesty is in a position to announce that the US has breached them. If
you doubt it, hop over to the UN webite. Its got a data base on who has
signed what convention when. Its quite interesting.

Surely you are taking the piss by saying "We are far more moral than anyone
else". In the highly unlikely event that you are not taking the piss, please
explain why you think the US is far more moral than anyone else. According
to Disney? I dont understand why you make that statement and I think no one
else will either. If you would like to understand the conventions, then you
can read them on line. They are easy to understand. Dont rely on the Hogans
Heros versions of international law lol.

At least you are not arguing that the pretext for war was not BS.

Sad you find it difficult to accept the objective facts of the case however.

On what basis do you make that statement? Is it easier to believe in fantasy
than the facts that are known? Or is it that you think accademics and lower
ranking solders are the worst dregs of humanity? I dont understand your
statement - or perhaps you need to read the source material on the issue?

ah right so you think torture is ok so long as its done by the people who
ask for it to be done? I think the torture is the bigger problem, not the
blame shifting. I think you know that. Face it. America is one of the bad
guys.

Hmm interesting. America is in a minority of nation states that sanctions
state sponsored murder. You seem to make the point that perhaps you are not
in the minority, if pro murder nation states are weighted for their
population density? I cant see the logic in that argument - either you think
state sanctioned murder is right or wrong - but for the sake of the
excersise,  I might do the math over the next couple of days to see if the
numbers stack up just for the hell of it. America is in fine company with
China for sending countless (subsequently found to be innocent) folks to
death and its population is huge - perhaps that will deliver the numbers for
you....  Lets see. In any event, are you suggesting that America's torture
of untried persons is acceptable because China kills is citizens? Are the
prisoners the lowest dregs because your government told you they were? The
same government you say you don't trust? Perhaps you are just taking the
piss after all. I Dunno.

I am not sure I understand what you are trying to say when you write "And
how many of those nice countries without it would you feel safe as an
innocent man in there court system?" Obviously you would feel safer as an
innocent man in the judicial process if you knew the government were not
going to kill you at the end of the court circus.
