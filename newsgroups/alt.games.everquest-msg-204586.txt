First off, if you are looking to get rich quick selling highend tradeskill
made items, forget about it.  Chances are that you will spend more on
raiseing your skil than you will earn back.  That being said
www.eqtraders.com has all the information you could ever need to know about
learning a tradeskill.  If you want something easy and cheap to get to 250
(which is pretty much the skill level where you can make things to sell for
money (aside from Heady Kiolas and Leather paddings)) you can do brewing or
JC.  Some of the stat drinks will sell for a reasonable amount in the bazaar
as will PoP jewlry, if you happen to have access to the components.  Cheap
but somewhat harder is baking, with which stat foods can be made.  Cheap,
but requiring what seems like unending hours of farming, is blacksmithing.
If you happen to be a dark elf, then there is some nice cultural that can be
made along the skill up path as well as excellent blue diamond items.
Pottery is neither cheap nor easy, but the PoP focus items are pretty
nice(again if you have a way of getting the components).  As for
tailoring.... all I will say is "Tailoring is pure evil suckled from the
cold teat of Innoruuk himself."

Best of Luck in your Tradeskilling ventures,
