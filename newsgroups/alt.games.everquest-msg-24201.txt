Do nothing. Just /em "points and laughs at utter morons".

The joy of idiots who refuse to admit their mistakes is that they don't get
the opportunity to learn from them. They are doomed to repeat them until
there is no-one left to blame, at which time they normally head to a public
forum proclaiming: "WTF IS THIS SHIT VI"

Then we all get to /em "points and laughs at utter morons".

What is the worse they can do: Petition? GM "ACcOUnT CrUShEr" turns up -
observes the situation for a few minutes and then just  /em "points and
laughs at utter morons"... (whilst quietly setting their serverside <chance
of zoning to 10K HP fall> setting up a few percent).
