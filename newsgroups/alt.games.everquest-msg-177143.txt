If you are attacking, you will get a "can't PP while attacking" message.
If the mob is undead, you will get a failure message.
If the mob has only nonmagic loot, or 0 or 1 coin of each type, you
   will get a failure message.
If the mob "doesn't have pockets", you will get a failure message. Stick
   to humanoids like orcs, elves, aviaks, etc. Snakes, bats, elementals,
   and such do not "have pockets".

Otherwise, you get a chance to take a few coins or an item from the mob,
and you also get a chance at a skillup. Nothing quite as exciting as
stealing the pelvis off a gnoll without him noticing!

A polite rogue asks permission of the group before pickpocketing mobs.
They will figure it out on their own when they notice a lot of mobs with
only 1 coin of each type on them. Also, if you fail badly enough, the mobs
will sometimes notice and complain about it.
