Shees. Level 49 mage here. Walk to room by killing anything in my path, sit
in room, send pet to anything that moves, chainnuke chancellor when he pops,
kill anything that moves when walking out.

Got to love the lvl 49 earth pets :)

I was there with a lvl 51 cleric friend and he had a hard time getting
spells off before my pet killed the wimps. He reverted to stunning and
pulling outside the room after a while to kill the time. 2 hour spawn is
boring when you don't have a guild (moved to AB).
