Only if the trader is actually there, then trader holds it, identifier casts
on the trader.  Not sure if only the trader sees the resulting message.  I
know Enchanters get identify, not sure off hand who else.

Sounds to me like 50pp would be worth the try, even if you can't get it
identified first.  A couple HG kills will get that money back for her.
