I assumed you were talking about a RL, non-EQ gathering here, in which case
they'd think you were an idiot.  Wizards don't exist.  But if you're talking
about an EQ chatroom or a gathering of EQ players, and you walked in and
asked if there were any "wizzies" there, they would know what you're talking
about because that term gets thrown around all the time in EQ.
