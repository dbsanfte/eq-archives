No idea what (if anything) the saltwater seaweed is for.  Mention of
which zone the
boat was in when you fished it up might help jog someone else's memory.

Battleworn canteen is part of the second Brell cleric symbol quest, end
result is
without a doubt the finest magic item in the entire game; it has a
clickable
effect which turns one summoned water ( a spell clerics get at around
level 9 )
into an entire -stack- of Brell's Blessed Stout.
