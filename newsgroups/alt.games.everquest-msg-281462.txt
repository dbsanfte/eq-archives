	Ok, so I did a few of these when they first came out, they
were fun, but nothing I'd want a steady diet of.  Last night someone
sent me one of those "driveby" invites to "griffons, it's a MM, want 
to join?" so I did.  I wasn't sure where to go, and group chat was 
full of the kind of chatter you see when a group of long time co-players
are grouped.  I got the mission screen on the way to East Commons, started
seeing "two more eggs" and the like while I was figuring out how to zone
in to the mission, and next thing I new "OK, we're done!" and I get
almost a full AA.

	Hmmm.  We start another and this time I zone in too.  While
I'm discovering me new griffon abilities (flying around EC as a griffon
was pretty cool) they all run off and start the mission.  Once more I see
group chat and have no idea what's going on.  "Where are you guys?"
"Use track".

	Oh, cool.  I have track.  So I track a group member.  He's kiting
guards.  I ask if I should kill them too, and the answer is "Whatever."
SO I root one and start dotting it, but in the meantime I see the 
Mission Completed message.  I zone out (actually get booted, since everyone
else leaves mission) and get ANOTHER AA.  

	Total elapsed time maybe all of 20 minutes.  Now, I have
no objection to free XP, but I think this stuff kind of sucks because
there's no way someone leveling this way will EVER learn to play.  You
don't even play as a real player class, never mind as the one you're 
leveling...  And if you die, well, so you wasted 10 minutes and will
only get 4 AA's an hour...  That's why the guard kiter didn't care what I did.
Didn't matter if he died or not, still got the XP and no penalty...
