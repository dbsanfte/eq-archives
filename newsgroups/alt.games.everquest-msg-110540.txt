I'm not sure it's an exploit to do that, but from watching how it's done, 
I suspect that a GM/guide would think it is.  If you see him bugged, run 
by him (but I always run down the right/south side), but I wouldn't 
recommend doing the harmony trick.  (And from what I've seen, it's not 
just cast harmony and run by.)
