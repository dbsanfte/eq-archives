Inside the lighthouse in Gunthak there is a merchant (to your left if you
are looking at the bankers). She sells the trade supplies needed to make the
dye and a book that tells you how to do it.

You will need access to a kiln and a brew barrel (or, as the book says, a
medicine bag). Both of these are behind the huts near the lighthouse.

I don't know what the trivial levels are for making the items. The work in
the kiln is always trivial, I think, as it just involves a firing sheet and
an unfired item. The brewing part trivial level must be somewhere above 65,
as that is the skill level I had when I tried it and it was non-trivial.
Made two attempts, one failed and one succeeded.
