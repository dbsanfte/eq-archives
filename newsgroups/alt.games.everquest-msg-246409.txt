For the pleasure and satisfaction of grouping.  The pleasure to be had
by being in a "hot" group (savvy, working smoothly together,
complementing each others field of expertise yet efficient in their
own individual right, and funny too, hopefully) far surpasses the
pleasure from a successful solo venture, in the long run.

Soloing is great, but cannot replace in-group chat and jokes, the much
more rapid bashing of mobs, and  the fact that instead of hunting cozy
blues and risky yellows, you can wipe out reds one after the other.
You get to see other classes's spells and abilities in action, noting
what works and what doesn't, or passing on tips that you know and they
don't. You become part of a team - the sum of which is greater than
it's parts.  You make friends, roam further, risk that little bit
more.  If things go wrong, your new buddies will help you out, or you
help them.  They'll be there for you next time it happens too.

No, I like to solo - pushing your character to new limits on it's own,
and keeping the loot and xp for myself, but I'd pass all that up for a
"hot" group.
