when the big boat arrives at FV docks (the one with the huge sails), get on
that.
wait for it to move and zone into Butchers block. When it stops, a bunch of
small "shuttles" will ariive, jump on one of them.
the shuttle will take you to the docks at Butchers Block, get off the
shuttles when at the dock.
Run accross to the other dock and wait until a big boat arrives there, it
will be called "sirensbane" or something similar. Jump on it and settle down
for the long trip to Freeport.
This whole trip, from FV  > BB > FP will probably take 45 mins at least.
