Just a few words about the new patch.  I am very disappointed by the lack of
understanding by Sony that some people WANT to solo instead of group. I
always solo.  My experience with grouping is that it takes time to set the
group up and I would rather be playing my character.  Grouping is fine for
those of you want to do it.  KEI did not take away from grouping, but it has
diminished the fun of the game for those of us who want to solo.  People can
be "social" without grouping through the chat feature.  I have played this
game for a long time ( one of the orignal beta testers) and downtime has
always been an issue, but KEI allowed us to explore many new areas, get
different loot and meet new people.  Isnt this what Sony wants?  I emailed
sony and offered 2 suggestions...  to increase the mana regen rate or to
give all caster classes some sort of Clarity spell.  I hope Sony reconsiders
the portion of the last patch that took KEI from alot of people who were
enjoying it.  Plus, I am curious how many KEI casters felt burdened by all
the poeple coming to them and donating for KEI???
