Ok,I had a more careful look.
On the German Blizzard homepage there is a press announcement,
which says 620.000 sold copies in Europe(not only Germany),and since
1.April 250.000 more shipped to the stores.
Last numbers I heard from the U.S were 1.500.000 sold boxes.
Cant find hard numbers for Korea,lets say 500.000.
So that makes roughly 2.700.000,ok not 10 times ,but nonetheless
another dimension than EQ2 sellings.

>Is EQ2 really at 600k?  Or were you just guessing?

No,wasnt guessing,I am sure it was in the official news on SOE
homepage some months ago,so it was a little vague,if the number was
from the "station pass" or exclusivly EQ2.I highly doubt its EQ2 only.


All in all a pretty bad performance from SOE with 6 years experience 
advantage in running a MMORPG.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I know I repeat myself,instead of running 2 MMORPGs,it would have been
much better to make a hard cut and close EQ1,letting the players of
EQ1 transfer to EQ2 without the need to buy new Boxes,after all the 
players already financed the developement of EQ2 with their monthly
EQ1 fees.
They will loose more EQ1 players fast ,its a vicious circle,game
already has become almost unplayable because of impossibiliy to find a
group in a tolerable time on the 2 servers I occasional still play,and
these are already merged ones.

175 Traders just right now on the already merged AB/KB  server,pretty
sad to call this "thriving" when the number has come down to a third
compared to 1 or 2 years ago.
