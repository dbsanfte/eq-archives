Or from the source, the Verant developers board:

http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000521.html

"o We've cleaned up what happens while you're zoning. The days of a
frozen screen full of blurry text may well be over, forever. (The days
of losing /tells, /guild chat, and group messages while zoning will
hopefully be heading out the door behind them.)"

Its one of the things down under "For all everquest players."

Really it may be the single best change of all.
