It's not all that boring but geez man put in some line breaks....

Remember if you leave something sitting up like that its fair game,
she wasn't out of line at this point. Though its pretty tacky to do
something like that.

You ksed her. Or tried to at least.

This was a curious statement, why were you taking screenshots? To
trash that person's rep on a web board? (I completely agree with doing
that sort of thing btw, reputation being the big penalty for jerks in
EQ) If it was for the GMs benefit you should know that GMs don't
accept any screenshot as evidence at any time, ever. Except what they
get when you do /report.

Now she's trying to ks you of course.

Poetic justice. We all love to see that.
