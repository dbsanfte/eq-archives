The message has appeared a few times with my gnomie cleric, but it is
normally when a player is not online. In such a case, I would suggest trying
to log off and back on. It might have something to do with a bug while
zoning... or sumfin. If nothing else helps, petition in game. If a guide
gets the same message while trying to rez you, there is definatley something
wrong with it... and a GM has to be found.

Solitude :o)

P.s. Gnome clerics are the best :o)
