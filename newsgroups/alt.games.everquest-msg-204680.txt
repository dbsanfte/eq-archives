If your character has reasonable faction in Katta there is a
fairly easy quest you can do for an EB neck item. You have to
kill mobs in the grey, but they're not that tough for a 50+
group or soloist class.

That said an EB item is so much better than the spell. Standard
EB has a variable duration, which basically means it drops at
the most annoying times. It needs a component, can be stripped
and the recast interrupted. You can put an item on while FD or
invis and then just forget about it.

My necro adores his fishbone earring. Partly because the 
people at Katta are a little narrow minded but also because
I love being able to FD underwater.
