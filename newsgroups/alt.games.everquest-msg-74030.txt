Anyone here anything about ETA of PC merchants (ie, new bazaar feature
that was supposed to be released with SoL)???

Also,  when in the bazaar - if you go to the tent(?) right next to the
bank, the merchant immediately to the right  has some goofy thing with
his hair going on (looks like it exploded around his head) - his name
is peculair in that it is "!merchant soandso" which is strange since
it begins with "!".....
