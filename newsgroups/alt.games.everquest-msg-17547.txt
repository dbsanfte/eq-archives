Yea, Ive already started looking for a motheboard. I have found a
"barebones" set up with a motherboard that comes with a 1 Ghz processor and
a built-in video card and sound. I guess the built-in will hold me over
until I can upgrade the card :P. It does have an AGP slot so Im thinking
maybe the radeon 64mg DDR? Would that handle luclin? Thats also running it
with 512mg ram. LMK what you think of that...
