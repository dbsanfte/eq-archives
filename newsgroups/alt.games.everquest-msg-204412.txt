My first car was a Chevy.  A bright red little Chevy Sprint. It was this
bizarre little wonder car that, though years older, did 10mpg more than it
was rated for (that's right, 60mph...nice cheap student car it was!), and
never gave me trouble.

Then a guy I was dating totalled it. :(

I miss that little hot tomato car, though I'd never buy Chevy, or anything
other than Japanese cars, at this point.  IN fact, I probably won't buy
anything other than a hybrid anymore (I drive Prius). Toyota is evidently
expanding their hybrid car line, so all my car needs are pretty much set
right there.
