There's also, for the desperate, a "pay as you go" card some banks
offer (Net First, for one). It's a last ditch type card. Absolutely no
credit check required, currently in bankrupcy is fine, don't even
check for a job. It's like a secured card, but it's not. Basicly, $500
credit line with a $500 "reservation fee" placed on the card when you
get it. Send in $50, you have $50 credit available (minus fees). You
don't have to put up the security deposit up front, and it is reported
as an unsecured card for if you're trying to help your credit rating.
Usually an application fee involved with these cards, though.
