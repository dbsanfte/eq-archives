Firstly, you know that if you remember your original account name and 
password, you can reactivate it, don't you? No need to play from level 1 
if you were attached to that character... Hell, even if you only remember 
your account name, you can probably get the password back from Verant.

Now, as far as the lockups are concerned, they appear to me that they 
only happen on client-side, graphics-related actions, so I would probably 
suggest that you try different versions of the drivers (even if yours are 
the most up-to-date). Get the drivers from the EQ web site, for example, 
or the ones from NVidia, or the ones from the card manufacturer's web 
site. Something is bound to work.
