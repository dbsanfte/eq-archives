There are still good reasons do a lot of tradeskills, including
for example the Coldain Shawl quests.

I've had a Paladin as my main for over two years, and I've
never known a time when Paladins could in any sense claim to be
in "a three-way tie for second best healers".  We've always
been well behind Clerics/Shamans/Druids.

But we've also always been well ahead of Rangers as healers, and
still are, so it's hardly fair to say "about as insignificant
as a ranger".

I couldn't give you exact numbers, but I notice a *big* jump in
the frequency of skill-ups going from 160-ish WIS to 250-ish.

For example, I got to 115 Tailoring skill back when the highest
I could get my WIS was about 160.  The skill-ups were painfully
far apart.  I recently took up Tailoring again now that Wu's
is available for skill-ups, and my "tradeskill suit" puts me at
255 WIS.  My skill-ups were coming fast and furious, often
getting two skill-ups in a row, and 100 combines got me to
a skill of 136 (21 skill-ups).
