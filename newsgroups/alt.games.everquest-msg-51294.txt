Question for the MM experts here:

Think a 51 druid can solo Mistmoore? Specifically, I want to go pick
myself up a Nightshade Wreath from Maid Issis.

I intend to go in wiith Resist Fire and Resist Magic up. I can add a
pair of Velium Diamond Wedding Rings (each +8 to all resists) if
needed. I'll harmony everything around (and in) the Maid's Room. I've
read there are 3 spawns with her, which is cause for concern.

Is this doable, or should I try to bring in a team?
