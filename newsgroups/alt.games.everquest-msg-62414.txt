And that is really all that matters.  If you are happy, then all is well
with the world.  No one would be misusing your site by grabbing it since
you have included that within your intent.  But if you did have an issue
with it and folks disrespecting your intent either made you so cranky
you took down your site or your host became so cranky that you could no
longer afford to host the site then the eq world would have lost a very
nice thing.  That is really my point, respect those who go the the
trouble and effort to provide these sites or risk losing them not just
for yourself but for everyone.
