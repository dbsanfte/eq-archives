No real way other than trial and error (i.e, change a faction, see if it
helps your /con of that NPC).

Many people have done this over time, and Allakhazam and others
have compiled their findings.  But there's no other way.

As another poster mentioned, you can kill an NPC and one of the
faction drops (if any -- many "factioned" NPCs don't actually
give faction hits, such as the wyverns in CS, for example)
is *probably* the faction of the NPC, but not always.

Personally, I always thought it would be a nice thing if
there were some in-game way to check the faction group of
an NPC.  One of the more RP ways would be for Enchanters to
have a spell which they can cast after targeting an NPC,
and it'll inform them of the faction group.  (Similar to
the existing "Identify" spell for items.)
