Hiya

I have noticed that up until 30 , when I could start killing stuff with
reasonable drops (which I may have been able to do earlier depending on how
much risk I like taking , and on group) I have been spending a day or so at a
time buying and selling purely.  This was to upgrade my equipement after I had
managed to gain a little plat.

Now , 31 , I am finding that it is much better to simply use what I have and
level , hopefully gaining better equipment through drops and money for items is
much less of a problem.  I still am inclined to auction now and then for stuff
I have or want , but I anticipate the plat building up as I am not really
spending it.  Now I think I will be fighting , and questing and helping out
other guild members.  I really only need money for food and drink and perhaps a
skill.  This is fine with me , really.

However , I just wondered if this corresponded with anyone else's experience ?
