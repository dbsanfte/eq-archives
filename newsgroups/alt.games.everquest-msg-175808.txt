I've *heard* about pushing mobs around with melee, and I've noticed it
happen to me, but I haven't figure out what causes it, or how you can
improve your chances of doing it. Is it an effect of high strength, damage
dealt, hits connecting, the weapon type, high offense, high attack, high
weapon skill, something else??

kicks! :)
