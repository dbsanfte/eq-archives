No you have to have a certain mentality to do this, not to be a Druid.
Why are druids doing this then? Because they are the class that has all the
abilities to do it, sure they are the second best solo'ers but Necro's can't
track, sure they are the second best Trackers but then a Ranger cannot solo
nearly as well as a Druid.
It's not that all Druids go out and do this, it's that some people will and
the class most capable is a Druid, I could go and do this with my Druid but
my Main is a Warrior. Am I not doing this because my main class is that of a
Warrior or because I am just not inclined to fuck about with someone elses
quest for self gain?
