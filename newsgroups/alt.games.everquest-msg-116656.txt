I put it to you that you are an idiot, and that, by your own
definition the corvette you drive is *also* a toon being "a hand
animated representation of something not existing in the real
world..." (your machismo) "...and bearing no visual relationship to
the actor performing the part..." (you).

Ok, ok. I'm just playing with ya. Of course, I have no idea what kind
of car you drive *or* your affinity for the ladies. What I *do* know,
however, is that splitting hairs over the level of "toon-ness" of our
EQ characters is kind of silly. Personally, I don't like the term
either. No big deal.

Disclaimer: I have no reason (other than his post - *dang it!* Stop
it!) to actually think that Lance is an idiot. The content of my
response was fictitious and contrived purely in the interest of making
a point.
