I think you are 100% correct the worst thing Verant has done is allow Joint
Quest. Joint Quest has encouraged Guild camping to no end I have seen on
Prexus the AC spawn in OOT camped by a guild for 5 days taking shifts to try
to get all there lower members JBoots. I can understand a guild helping
their members out from time to time but not have every members equipment
maxed out. I have had lower members ask me to get Items for them and I have
but I make them go with me and camp along side of me. Call me a dick or what
ever but I believe it adds a little appreation to the item they want if the
have to take a few risks to get it.
