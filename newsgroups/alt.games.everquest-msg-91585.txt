Thank you for the info but I have to say that really stinks.  What a let
down.  I mean, I realize that Luclin isn't on Norrath but come on.  Do you
have to be on Luclin for the Nexus group port you get at later levels as
well?  That would suck.  I guess I assumed that it worked like every other
gate spell even though it's on a different "planet".  Oh well, I guess I'll
hafta to take the Nexus ports like everyone else.  I'll stop whining now!
