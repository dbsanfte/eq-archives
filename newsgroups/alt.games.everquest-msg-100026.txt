damn.. Was that the resason.. hehe

I found out (and though) that this was something happening everytime i
restarted the machine.. searching the registry for any info.. totally got me
confused..
I only use the c:\temp folder to like unpack files (drivers etc), but when
it is empty it is deleted..

Hehe.. Well thanx guys.. now i KNOW the reason why.. Actually got me worried
it might be some new virus that NAV did not take or something..

Well.. The next part is to maybe get verant to use some other folder for
this.. why not "the install folder \temp (eg. c:\program
Files\Everquest\Temp ) or something..
