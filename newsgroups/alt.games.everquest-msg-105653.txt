It's more than a bit of a stretch.  First he states an opinion as if
it were a fact (I know, I know, pot calling the kettle black).  Second,
he does so in the face of painfully clear evidence that multi-questing
is an intentional part of the game.  The evidence for this is that
(1) multi-questing been in place for _years_ and (2) quests specificly
designed to prevent multi-questing have also been in place for _years_.
