Correction, you get less XP per kill than any other zone in the game.
The mobs are easy and plentiful.  There are scores (if not hundreds)
of "safe" spots where you can rest without any risk of roamer agro
(barring a train).  The loot is acceptable for the level, easily
keeping a solo melee in bandages or buying spells for a caster (or
both for a hybrid).  It is one of the easiest zones for a melee 16
to 30 to solo in (note the wide level range), or 1 to 30 if you're
Iksar.  Solo or grouped, its a decent place to get a melee to L30
with all combat skills at or near level cap, and it doesn't take
nearly as long as the low ZEM would suggest.  Caveat:  If you're
being PL'd (or are a particularly extreme twink) there are lots of
other zones where you can xp much faster.  But if you're a more
ordinary sort you'll easily be able to kill fast enough to see very
satisfactory movement of your xp bar.  And finally, possibly its
single best feature is that all the morons and their even less
likeable fellow travellers have moved to PC.
