Players are packing in cheek to jowl in certain xp friendly zone while
others are abandoned.  I think SOE would do well to make xp in places like
the Oasis comparable to xp in Paludral.  I felt plenty of nostalgia going
past orc highway a couple of times recently and seeing nobody there.  All
those juicy orcs just going about their mean old business unmolested.
Meanwhile, Paludral probably had 50 million toons in it.

If you want plenty of company, start a toon on the Stromm server!
