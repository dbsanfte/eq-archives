Man, you little whippersnappers have it easy.  Back in *my* day, we didn't
have no fancy shmancy blinking text over a mob's head to indicate which one
was targeted.  Whack the wrong one and ruin the chanter's mezz?  Tough
boogers.  You had to use a freaking sun dial (or an egg timer) to tell when
your spells wore off, none of this pansy hand holding "Your spell has worn
off" message nonsense.  Bah.  I bet all you warriors out there just couldn't
live without your precious little critical hits, could you?  Well guess what,
we didn't used to have 'em, and we didn't need 'em.  You guys don't know how
good you have it.  "Waa, waa, Lake of Ill Omen is too crowded," you say?  Try
shoving every last person who's over level 40 into two indoor zones and tell
me if you know the meaning of crowded.  Why, back when I was growing up in WC,
the death penalty was TWICE as bad as it is now, and we didn't even bat an
eye!  "Ow," you cry, "I died and xp loss makes me sad!"  NO REZ FOR YOU!  See
how you like it?  You kids are all soft.  We got to level 50, we stayed there,
and we LIKED it, dammit.
