So you say. Having not played EQ for 9 months I guess I cant argue on that

We did it with 45, but that was much later, with better gear and lots of 
aa's. That doesnt excuse the roadblock that destroyed many guilds and caused 
many to quit, not to mentioned those that were cockblocked on RZ. (I notice 
you avoided saying anything about the emp cockblock)

Which is exactly what I did, unfortuantely it required a server transfer to 
find a guild that raided my time. (Which cost over $200 for 2 accounts, 
another reason to avoid the sony rip off machine)

Notice how he doesnt include any detail of his own. Basically just a "You're 
wrong".
Ill leave it up to the reader to decide who's babbling.
