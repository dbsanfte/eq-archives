Grouped with guildies in POI for a couple hours last night, now 3 yellow 
in to 51.  Its fun watching skills go up again; several of them were 
capped till 51, and now they are heading twoards final cap for the 
class, instead of for the level.  At 51 I don't think there are any 
skills left that are level capped.

So here's me midway thru 51

or.... sort of.  Hmm, did Magelo do -another- roll back?  There are 
several pieces of gear that are wrong and I know I updated at least some 
of them, particularly that eyeball that keeps creeping back into my ear!
