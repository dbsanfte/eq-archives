Caps at 100.

I poked around a bit, but I can't find a list of locks by level
needed.

I had gloves that gave me +3% lockpick (a gift from a gnome
guildmate who was making them just to see what it was like) but I
just gave them away to a guildmate rogue who didnt have a pair
and needed them to pick the door to the ST keyholder.

So, in particular, I'm wondering if there are any locks that are
pickable at 103% but not at 100%.. or if there's a higher
lockpick mod item that would let me pick any locks that I can't
at 100.

As a bonus, I'm hoping to find a list of any locks at all that I
can pick, the skill seems to be almost entirely useless capped at
this level... the Hole, but frankly I'd rather sit there and mock
anyone incapable of squeezing thru the crack.

Llyric, 50 bard, 100 skill.
