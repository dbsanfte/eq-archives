I don't have theoretical problems with hate crime laws enacted
as sentencing guidelines or special circumstances;  that goes
to motive, inclination to commit the crime again, etc., all
standard part of the existing criminal process.

Hate crime laws which create new 'crimes' are a different matter.
It's really not a crime to hate someone; the law shouldn't be in
the business of enforcing correct thought.   I believe it would
be inevitable for people to be convicted because of their stance
on personal issues rather than any facts relating to the actual
crime.

It's far too easy for prosecutors to argue emotion and play on a
jury's own biases as it is;  allowing them to do so on a criminal
charge and swing the 'guilty of one, guilty of all' club would be
a big mistake, IMO.
