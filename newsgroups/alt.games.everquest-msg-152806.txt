Does not fit my observations at all. Of my characters the druid was the
hardest to level . Everyone who has not played a druid seems to recall them
at there peak at 29 leveling with ease in south karana. This represents
.001% of the game .

My cleric was the easiest to level . My enchanter is the most powerfull
soloing , and the most requested for groups. My monk is the most usefull for
a raid. My druid sits there and looks nice :p
