Depends on what the cut-off you put on "pedophilia". In nature, as
soon as animals are physically able to mate, they tend to mate or be
mated with. In human society, it's only a fairly recent thing for sex
with a child as young as even 13 to be considered taboo. Of course,
it's not necessary to start producing children as soon as we're able
to increase the chance of at least one child surviving to adulthood
anymore.
