Lance I have played EQ for 5 years like you and now I have played EQ2
and WoW and I have chosen to continue my subscription to EQ2 and not
WoW. The quests are spot on and the voice overs give them much more of
an interactive feel. I am really happy with what they have done. My
only complaint is the masive amount of lag and hicups in city zones is
almost unexceptable (now this is in NO way related to my pc I have a
monster that will default things like Doom 3 to highest settings) from
what I can tell it is on there side but hey the first one was laggy as
shit at times also. Even with that being said I would chose EQ 2 over
anything out now.
