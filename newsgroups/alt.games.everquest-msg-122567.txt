I just bought EQ and all three expansions. I'm going to start my first
character. I've watched a lot of EQ, and taken a character up to 4th,
so I know a little.

I want to solo, so what's the best class/race combo? I don't want to
be an evil race (so no Troll Shamans), and I don't want to be an evil
class (so, no Erudite Necromancers). So, my thoughts are-

Halfling Druid - Misty Thicket is good newbie zone (so I've heard),
and druids are cool.

High Elf Magician - Magicians are good soloers, high elfs are good
magicians, and high elfs can run over to Kelethin and get the
Crushbone Belt quest thingy.

Barbarian Shaman - Barbarians are the only good race that can be a
shaman (or has this changed with the SoL?), and shamans are cool, too.


Anything else I should be aware of? And which of the three is the best
to solo with for a new player?Thanks.
