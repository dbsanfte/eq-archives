Basically, turning in the note doesn't give you much more than a guild
tunic, some experience points, and faction. I've read that the faction
adjustment is pretty huge, but I can't confirm that. For certain
characters (Iksar Necro for example) it is very important to turn in
that note if you ever want to do further quests related to that initial
item. Other than that, though, don't worry about it. You can go into any
paladin guild and train your skills. Just find the GuildMaster (trial &
error) and right-click on him. You'll get a message like, "Up for some
training soandso?" And you will see a certain number of training points
you can use for various skills. Some skills, like Taunt, Dodge, Riposte,
Dual Wield, Double Attack, and Channeling, will require that you put one
skill point in them (at least) to get them started. Otherwise, you will
not be able to use them. Hope this helps!
