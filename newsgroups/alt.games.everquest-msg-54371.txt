That is they only way they will change your last name, because it in
someway violates their policy.

Er.. or there is the marriage way.

Note: if your name violates it in a very naughty way, its sort of a
"get out of jail free card" to do that. They won't ban you I guess
like they might discovering it themselves. 

Examples of last names in violation:

Licesto Snaralot: because the first and last name can't combine to
make up some phrase. In this case I think the last name by itself
would be okay but its the combination, so the gm might change the
first name only, or just the last name, or possibly both.

Where they can they will fix the above problem by changing the last
name, since its against their policy for the player to be able to
change his first name possibly to escape a bad rep.

Neecro Philliac: Actually still saw this name on the trib server a
while back then suddenly never see it ( I think I friended them just
to check, yes I am bored ;)  ) 

That is of course illegal for the same reason but even more so because
its naughty too. In that case the person could actually just be
outright banned, but I think fi they petitioned for a change first
that they'd give them the benefit of the doubt and change it.

The only other way you'd get a last name change:

Marrying another character with the last name you want or saying that
both the marrying characters want a new last name to use, or joining a
guild or something with a common last name. 

So, if you want a last name and your name does not break any rules you
are out of luck unless you:

1) find a person to marry with a last name you want who is willing to
participate in the scam.

2) find a person to marry with the last name you want who also wants
their last name changed to that last name like you do.
