First thing, your vid card might give you problems.

XP and EQ have no problems.

As for the basic vs trilogy - it all depends on you.  will you be happy
staying in the old world?  you can have fun (hell, tens of thousands of us
did before Kunark)  but you won't get to play as the Iksar, nor will you be
able to go to places your friends will who have it, or have all the items
(soem require you to have the expansions to see/use).

I've been playing on and off since day 1.  I haven't even scratched the
surface of the game.

yes, when you first connect, you will be downloading a TON of patches.  not
that bad on a broadband connection though.  there are also OPTIONAL patches
you can download - free zones and such.
