As a necro i more or less have to use DoT's since most of my spells
are of that kind, my best DD is shock of poison that does 155dmg for
100mana, and as have been said when the mob is moving towards you not
rooted or feared DoT's do 66% of there damage, so i fear kite and that
usually works okey, having my pet whack the mob in the back, the mobs
i fight now at lvl 26 do hit rather hard 50's and 60's so my pet can't
take it for long, so i must keep fear on all the time (lvl 4 fear
lasts like 18 seconds) fear is also resisted a lot so i try to med
during fight but i have to be on my toes all the time.

I don't have root now, get it at lvl 34 and i get a better snare/dot
at 29, better fear at 34 that lasts (hopefully) 42secs, then i can
change tactics to root/dot instead of snare/fear/dot, let's say i get
more options at lvl 34.

My druid is only lvl 14 so he doesen't have ton's of mana, the way i
see it if i get an add during the fight i hopefully have enough mana
to deal with that, like root park and run like a school girl :)

The snare and nuke usually leaves me OOM and if attacked then it can
get uggly, my wizard has that problem at lvl 13, only root that brakes
randomly and when oom he is dead :(
