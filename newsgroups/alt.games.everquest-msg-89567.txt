My new necro erudite has been trying to kill something in the Warrens and
not having much luck.  But somthing strange has been happening when I zone
back into Toxxulia from the Warrens.  If I zone at almost empty health, I am
arriving at my bind point instead of outside the zone. It's not that big of
a deal, cuz the bind point is up at the top of the cliff, but it is strange.
Is this supposed to happen or is this a bug?  By the way, it's not just me,
my son created a new necro too and the same thing happened.
