I never even realized this was an issue that people felt so strongly
about! After reading the replies that you've gotten, I am
flabbergasted (sp?). I, for one, have been in chat rooms and in games
for so long that I don't even see whether someone has typed "please"
or "plz". They are exactly the same to me. I know my brother has only
recently begun to get into games and...well...anything computer
related, really. To type those extra 3 letters would take another 10
seconds for him. Time that the person he is asking might wander off,
or something could happen so that the request becomes moot. I'm not
saying that everyone has such sorry typing skills, but what you learn
to begin with is what kind of sticks. At that instant when the time to
type 3 extra letters becomes small enough to be moot, will he suddenly
start typing full words when he has up to now been forced to type
abbreviated words in the interest of being ABLE to communicate
reliably? I think not. I don't refuse someone anything just because
they use abbreviated words.

On the flip side, I would not complain to someone who DOES refuse for
that reason. I go on the assumption that anyone speaking in
abbreviations hasn't got the typing skills to do any better, so I
don't feel any need to make it even harder on them by refusing them
something because of their lack of skill. It is just as easy however,
and every bit as valid, to assume that anyone speaking in this way is
just lazy. Probably more valid, in fact, because it doesn't take too
long to get to the point where typing a couple of extra characters
takes fractions of a second rather than several seconds.

Either way, it's not that big of a deal, people. Sheesh.
