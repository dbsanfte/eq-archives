Been using DSL with EQ for over a year now and it works great - I've
been using Avirt Gateway as my firewall/web interface for the rest of
my phonenet network in the house. It was easy to configure for my son
to play his account off of his system and my wife to maintain her eBay
(*sigh*) fix.  A little pricey ($100+ for a 10 connection license). I
tried WinProxy but just too much of a pain in the arse to configure
and maintain connections.

My 2 cents...
