Not flaming anyone here... Jeff, I thought that I'd give this to you from a
trucker's perspective. I happen to agree with you, but this is the way it
is, on those wide open roads of the US. The "clean cut" guys, and the women
who drove while I was still doing it, never (or hardly ever, from what I
heard) got called into the scalehouse (weigh stations) for some oddly
irritating and generally trumped up reason. It was almost always the guys
with long hair, who *looked* like they might have smoked dope. They
generally got reamed everywhere they went, from paperwork to logbooks. I
drove for 8 years and got called into the scalehouse 3 times. And those were
random, except for Colorado, where everyone gets stopped if they don't have
a VIN on the side of their truck, and at the borders going into Canada,
where, as well, everyone pretty much has to go in for paperwork, if nothing
else. And as I said, I completely agree with you. I don't think people
*should* be harrassed for how they look, but it's a sad fact that they
certainly are. I realize as well that this is OT, I just thought I would
give you a trucker's perspective. Man, do we ever have to put up with some
bullsh*t. Not just from State Police and Sheriffs and city kitties, but from
every weigh station that we come across! It sucks to be a trucker.

Dark
