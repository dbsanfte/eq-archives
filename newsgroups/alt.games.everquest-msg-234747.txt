That pretty much undermines the point of playing the game. Currently a
non-twink can easily himself at level 5-15 with level appropriate gear
for a 50th level player pretty easily. But top end stuff
(elemental/time/ldon etc) is all no drop. So that's where it stops. If
you want to improve your equipment past a certain you point you have
to *play* the game. That may be 'unrealistic' but it sure beats the
alternative.
