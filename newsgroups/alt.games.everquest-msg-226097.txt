I just went and put my charm and stone in the bank and was still able to 
use the magus.  And I'm sure I've used it while dead and naked, as a 
shortcut when running from POK to Oasis or NRo.  Checked my key ring 
(/keys) and the only thing on it is my Trakanon Idol.

Only thing I didn't try was destroying the whole thing... I don't have 
my notes handy on how to do it again or I would.  So its possible that 
having it in bank or on body is also fine... but I'm guessing that 
really doing the quest itself sets the flag somehow that lets you use 
the system.

While I was at it, I took a look at the stats.  +3 hp +3 mana.

Here are my completed missions:

Deepest Guk 0
Miragul     1
Mistmore   13
Rujarkin   15
Takish      8

I've talked to the stone guy in both the 13 and 15 camps.  After talking 
to the first one I had a +1 +1 item, so I assume the second one got me a 
bigger jump.  When I get two more Takish missions I'll talk to the one 
in NRo and see how we do, I predict it becomes +6 hp +6 mana, but 
there's no telling really.  If that logic continues, getting Miragul 
might see +10 +10 and then Deepest Guk +15 +15... but hopefully getting 
all 5 would also mean something extra, maybe +1 to all stats and resists 
or something along those lines.

OR its possible, since thats over 30 successful missions, that talking 
isn't needed after all, once you go thru the first conversation.  But I 
haven't talked recently, pretty sure last time I did I didn't have 30 
total missions.

7 times 15 is 105, so I'm off somewhere, doing this to 70 missions per 
each would only get you to +7 all stats and resists, but 105 to hp and mana.
