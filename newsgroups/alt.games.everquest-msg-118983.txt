I've been playing EQ for about 3-4 weeks.  My first char, warrior is lvl
15 - I decided to start a magic-using char, to learn a bit about how MU's
are played before I launch into building a "real" character.

So, night b4 last, I'm playing my druid, getting a feel for the mechanics of
scribing/meming/casting etc - some low-level warrior guy starts shouting
"can anyone heal disease"?  Of course, I know that I can't.  later, I see
him sitting by the guards, notice his HP bar is low and launch a cpl hits of
"minor healing" his way.  I'm pretty low level, so I don't have a HUGE
impact, but it's noticable.

His response:  "More".  I couldn't believe it.  I'd rather he not respond
than make such a blatant command.

I ignore him.
He repeats his demand 3-4 times.

Then he says "Cure Disease!"

Now, I'm pissed.  In the back of my head, I remember the heated discussions
I've read about people demanding TP and SoW's on this board.  I can't
believe this guy.

my response:  a.  I don't have ability to cure disease.  b.  How about a
simple 'Thank You'.

him - no response, no further demands...  (or course, no 'thx')

jeeez...

Now I understand...
