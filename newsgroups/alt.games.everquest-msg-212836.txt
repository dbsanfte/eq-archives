You need it every time the dispell happens.  I suppose it would be possible to
time the dispell on some mobs, but on others the dispell is a proc, which means
it happens when it happens, whether thats one second apart or ten, and there's
no audible warning beforehand ("I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your buffs
down in two seconds!")  Since there are other insta click items you can buy that
you don't dispell yourself constantly, I can't think why anyone who is NToV
capable would still be struggling along with the handicap of Invis as his junk
buff...

You'd use an item which runs thousands of plat (if you are a charm class who can
use one seriously) or that you looted and could either give to a charm class
buddy/guildmate or sell for thousands of plat, which doesn't protect you while
casting spells or meleeing, when you could instead pick up a spyglass for 25 or
50pp?   Other options like the shrunken goblin earring or the bracer of the
hidden still probably cost less than the Gazuli ring...  Whats your definition
of "have to", you play on a server where the entire gnome population was killed
by a giant tsunami?  I mean, yes, the spyglass is annoying, but its far better
than the gazuli ring for this purpose, and the gazuli ring is very rare and
quite valuable for a very different purpose; breaking charm instantly on demand.

As I said, I don't know that there isn't some way to use it while meleeing...
the only reason I could think of that someone would use this as his clicky would
be if there was a way around it being dispelled, long shot but didn't want to
rule it out and have someone pipe up with a solution.
