Where to level a 36sk without any expansion packs? My friends are all
enjoying the dreadlands together, and im rather sick of soloing the two
spawns at the bottom of the CT entrance for the once-per-day average
crusader spawn... in fact if I never get another piece of darkforge banged
together I'm not sure I'll mind.

Also, where's a smart place (old world :P) to make plat in a not-too-boring
way. Hill giant groups are appalling (yes nearly dying for my 5pp average
share is very exciting <g>) but surely a level 36 person can obtain wealth
in the old world?
