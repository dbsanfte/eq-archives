1)  Kael armor has slightly higher AC in general, while SS armor has slightly
better resists.  They are pretty much equivalent overall IMHO.  However:

2)  You're not going to get quest armor from Kael or Skyshrine until you are
54+ and belong to a guild that can put at least 4 groups 54-60 into Temple of
Veeshan.

3)  The armor that drops in Plane of Growth is pretty much equivalent to
Thurgadin quest armor.  It is, indeed, a clear step below Kael/SS armor but
easier to get and obtainable at a lower level.

For myself, personally and just for convenience, I'd rather get beaten on by
the dwarfs than by the giants.  You don't have to go through Thurgadin for
anything and the only inconvenience of being KOS to dorfs is attracting some
wolves and wolfmasters in GD (which the giants near the EW zone will be happy
to kill for you if you have good giant faction).  On the other hand, you really
are going to want to run through Kael sometimes (unless you are able to get
your dragon faction up as well, so that you can port into WL without bumping
into a pissed-off Wuoshi).

Furthermore, there is no "Coldain Death Squad".  The Kromrifs will kill you
eventually, no matter how careful you are.
They patrol much of EW, the EW zone of GD, Kael of course, and the eastern part
of WL.  Whereas Coldains only control a small area around Thurgadin.
