I had one resisted the other day.  Kinda suprised me. :)

}Atone usually takes several casts to completely calm a MOB. It's hard to

}a MOB's hate list completely the "watch MOB facing" method is fairly
}effective.
}But then I'd gathered an impression that memblur was superior... maybe
}just as a relative thing, i.e. seeing clerics as solely healers and
}chanters as solely crowd control. 

I looked em up at lucy.fnord.net.  Atone is 1.5 times the mana and 2 
seconds longer to cast.  The Atone effect is listed as Memblur(1%), and 
the Memory Blur effect is Memblur(10%).  Based on a rather brief 
experience being a cleric with atone though, I thought atone worked much 
more frequently.

}Whereas root+Pacify+Atone is almost as good as a mez now, although rather 
}more time-intensive.

Yup.  Cool.  You do that, I'll heal with the 3 charges on my stein of 
moggok. :)
