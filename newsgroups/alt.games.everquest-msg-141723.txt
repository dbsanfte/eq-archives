Problem is most of the idiots who make laws about the internet don't even
know how it works.

If I pick up a newspaper and it has a story about some sick bastid who
kidnaps some kid and murders them, do they blame the manafacturer of the car
he drove whilst they commit the act? Do they blame the council who maintains
the road he drived on whislt committing the act. Do they blame the landlord
of the house he rented with the basement to do the deed in? Shit no.

The internet is a road, differing only in the fact that it is owned by
no-one. and next to impossible to control.

Governments and Businesses hate that. They want to control things -
everything. There is nothing more annoying to any government as a widely
used media outside their direct control.

The music industry? Fuck em. Buch of junky fuckwits the lot of them. It has
always been a direct indicator of the pathetic condition of humanity that
rockstars, movie stars, sportsmen and people who produce nothing but mouth
off and sell shit are the ones who make the bucketloads of money.

My house has been burgled too. Theft is a fact of life, can we chain the
entire population to their beds so I won't get burgled again? I left the
military a long time ago and have not signed up for anyone elses army so
will not willingly submit to any form of collective punishement.
