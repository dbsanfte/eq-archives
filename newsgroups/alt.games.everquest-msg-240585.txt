Farming velium in CC and doing the Enchanted Velium Bits. The only
downside is CC is probably still camped up the kazoo and you usually
run into all sorts of grief trying to farm there. Another option are
the LDoN combines if you can get the material in the bazaar or in
dungeon drops.

I hunted there as a warrior while ducking to PoK to get SoE's from
druids. Was sad to see what they've done to it.

Combine temper.. which part.. the windstones? The windstones you
usually can get quite a few of farming the grimling caves in the west.
Just keep them clear and wait for the RNG to swing your way. These
also tend to be camped. Also a decent PP spot in that if you collect
the grimling runes they build up over time, are stackable, and no
weight issues taking to Katta.

Once you can get up to the mid-220's, probably shadowscream is your
best bet. Especially as a druid you can AE nuke the southern camp in
Hollowshade and buy/farm the swirling.
