Of all my chars, i think my Human SK was the coolest to play, although i
regret not making an Ogre or Troll. The levels prior to 9 are boring though,
as the SK doesn't become an SK before level 9 really (and then only
basically).

I am now aiming at an enchanter i want to start, since they have alot of
different tactics, playstyles and spells, but it saddens me that VI left out
froggy encs :(
