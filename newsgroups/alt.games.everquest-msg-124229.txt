I use XP, both the onboard AC'97 and SBpci 128 cause crackles on the sounds
and some strange effects sometimes. I know from friends who use SBlive cards
that they have a lot of problems with XP having lock ups and such like but
then sometimes runs perfect for days. My other machine I use at work, a
compaq deskpro, has sound onboard and works perfect with EQ.

I also would love to hear from someone who has bought a card, plugged it
into their PCi slot and had no troubles.. I for one will go and by that card
straight away.
