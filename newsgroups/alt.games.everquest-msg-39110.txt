Wanted to touch on your last paragraph here Silverlock.  See I don't think
that they're necessarily pointing that loaded gun at their own feet.
Consider if you will, UO (didn't you used to post the UO newsgroup under the
same name?? - anyway...) - localization changes were made recently which
made all of our Asian brothers and sisters giddy with excitement but
INFURIATED the English speaking masses who still pay to play as they claim
it took away some of the 'friendliness' of the original wording in the
client.

Going back further they (EA/OSI) have made many sweeping changes which have
always angered the long time players most, but in the long run have been
shown benefit the longevity and subscription base of the game in the
marketplace/genre.

Could it be that VI doesn't care about the long time players but rather the
new purchases off the shelf that bring them that initial however much for
the box *with* a new monthly subscription on top?  I think the TLC - as I
understand it talked about here - and many of the other UI/Combat  & Loot
interaction changes that have gone in are directly designed to bend the game
to appeal to the broadest possible player base ala UO.

It has the feel that these game companies, while starting very player
conscious in the beginning (another argument altogether - but consider
official web boards, game official appearances - roll out events) are moving
more and more away from appealing to the hard cores and more to the drop
ins.

As a drop-in to EQ really, I'm loving life now compared to the EQ I left
back in early 99 after a short run into release after that final beta phase.
As a UO hard core, I'm nothing that pissed at how they've raped the game I
once so loved.
