Yes!

Actually, that's pretty much what it's designed for. In the dungeons,
there's none of the old "find a spawn, sit and pull all day" routine
-- mobs don't respawn. You have a specific goal to accomplish, but
even if you fail, you come out with decent xp, loot (okay, it's not
*great*, but the best loot requires saving your points you get for
succeeding missions). It's honest to god dungeon-crawling.

No trainers, no KSers, no one usurping your "boss" mob in boss mob
quests, none of those usual headaches.

The only complaint I've seen is some people feel this will take out
too much of the "MMO" part of the MMORPG. I completely disagree... All
it removes are some of the biggest down-sides of the MMO aspect.

I enjoyed it immensely. The only part I didn't enjoy was a part of the
actual beta program rather than the expansion itself, and that part of
the NDA is still in effect, so I can't discuss it.
