Bahhhh... we hear this talk every time a new MMORG comes out. And
speak for yourself... Im an "old player" and still have a blast ;) EQ
is and will be still very alive and kicking. The sky is NOT falling.
And how are you speaking for brand new players? I know several that
have just started and dont find it "un-fun". Because you may be burned
out - dont assume EVERYONE is.

Every mmorg captures attention then the hub bub dies down a bit. 

I beta tested COH for a short time, and yes its fun, but I question
the long term holding power. My personal opinion is that COH will be a
fun diversion but not a long term addiction. I can see this game
getting rather repetitious quickly IMO. Will some leave EQ to play
COH? Certainly. Will the masses leave? Nope.

COH wont kill EQ. WOW wont kill EQ (contrary to popular belief). EQ2
wont kill EQ.

It was interesting, I reactivated my UO account not too long ago, just
for perhaps a short walk down memory lane and to see how things had
changed. Heres a game that I thought for sure was "dead" with all of
the other MMORG's out there. I was amazed at the population I
encountered. People still play this in large numbers!

EQ has something very large over all the new games that come hot off
the presses. Content. It has had 5 years to build on. So many games
get rushed to market and are so thin on content. In many cases, even
causal players consume the content quickly.
