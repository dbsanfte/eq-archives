Real story:

I'm medding up in The Overthere, some time in my forties, when this 
Dwarf Paladin comes up to me:

Him: Er... Are you on your own? Do you want to group?

Me: Not really, but I can tell that you do. Let's fear-kite some cats.

So we group, and I proceed to Ensnare, Fear and DoT some hapless 
feline... The Paladin starts whacking on the creature's back... I sit 
back to med again... watch my mana bar creep up... Get up to refresh 
Fear every now and then...

Me: Still at it?

Him: Yeah, man, sorry... I don't know what's wrong with me today... This 
is embarrassing. Sorry, man....

Me: No worries, take your time...

Him: This is sooo embarrassing...

Okey, there really is no point to this story at all, except to 
illustrate that before the recent changes, Paladins with mediocre 
equipment really had a rather low damage output. :)
