That would be consistent with conventional wisdom, but part of the 
problem *is* finding people of similar levels at this stage of the game. 
I know, I should probably work harder at starting my own groups. Trouble 
is, I've soloed enough and been away enough that I'm kind of in uncharted 
territory here. I don't really even know where to lead us if I *did* 
build a group. That does sound a bit like an excuse, though. I'll put 
more effort into that.

That's really what I was thinking about. I have a speed bump to rely on 
there, whereas on FV the sky's the limit, and the higher people go, the 
greater the disparity between us gets.

Oh, sure, when you put it that way, it sounds ridiculous. :P

Bah, don't give that a second thought. That would be crazy.

Aye, that would make all the difference in the world, I think. Though one 
very nice perk of being the guild young-un, was that I had some very nice 
gear dropped on me by the ubers on occasion. ;)

I'm sure you're right. That 1-60(ish) has been one looong enjoyable ride. 
Out of curiosity I checked last night, and that character was created in 
August 2002, but only has some 60 hours played. I doubt I have another 4 
years to get to this point all over again. :P

In conclusion - "59 Bard LFG!"
