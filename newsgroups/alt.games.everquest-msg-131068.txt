The hornets are spread out (and roam)   Go for ash hornets first as these
are the lowest level (and weakest resists)

Alternatively infront of the fort (roughly loc 1k, 1k) there are many
roaming mobs, which almost always (and with a bit of common sense, always)
are far enough apart to pull.

You can pull them to the side of the "bowl" under the fort (anywhere out of
the fort ramps agro radius) and won't get any adds at all.   Inside the bowl
is also totally safe away from adds, if you pull into there.

What I always did was pulled a wanderer (or giant) to the side of the fort
(away from the ramp into the fort, but not down into the bowl).. on the
small hill that forms the fort/bowl.  Never had add-worries here.

Theres an undead camp by the fort too, and the tree nearby is a safe pulling
spot.. try to avoid moldering and tatterback gorrilas, and warboned skeles
as these guys have a shitload of HP and hit real hard.   The rest should be
easily killable.. if your too low to single pull, look at the mobs placement
etc.. as a level 1 character I could pull with reasonable confidence the
biggest pull would only ever be 2.

If I were you I would pull hornets (they are around a big pit near the DL
zone, and those white star effect 'trees'), then wanderers infront of the
fort, then giants/undead camps.

Avoid at all costs - Ancient Giants, Wurms (miscons), gullerback (almost
100% MR named mob), the named wurms (they nuke, hard)

The sarnaks are weak, but some are sowed - so be real careful when fighting
these.
