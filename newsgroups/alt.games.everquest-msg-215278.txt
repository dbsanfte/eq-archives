Here's the thing, though, a contract doesn't have to be actually
signed to be binding. The signature is just one way of proving the
contract was accepted. A verbal contract with witnesses can be just as
binding as a paper contract. All that has to be done is to prove that
you agreed to the contract, nothing more. Showing that there's no way
to play the game without either agreeing to the contract or hacking
the software to get around it (which would be just as illegal) is all
that's needed.

The only cases where EULA terms have been defeated are cases where
they wouldn't be upheld in any form of contract anyway. Terms that the
company had no legal right to enforce.
