I am getting to hate the attitude of high level players and camping. 
Getting to th stage where I am going to give up EQ.  If someone is
camping for a particular mob, no problem, if someone or a group is
camping a spot for exp, no problem, but why oh why cant high levels
camp something there own level? I wanted to kill the guards in
Paineel, I get both exp and loot, only one other lvl 52 Pally there in
the courtyard, so I kill the guard at the bank, I am Lvl 30, the pally
comes and asks me to leave the ZONE as he is camping it all? Told him
I was here for the exp,stil he told me to go elsewhere as he was first
and wanted all the guards.  I just looged out in frustration at his
attitude, but would it made any diiference if i had petitioned to a
GM?  How do you deal with high levels that have no respect for the
needs of someone 20 levels below them?
