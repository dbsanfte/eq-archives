Annoying as it might be, other players have all the right to kill NPC
guards, where ever they please. Now, if there are two guards, it would be
nice if they left one, but not many do that. Cursing and swearing at him
will only get YOU into problems. And if you get soulmarked, that can work
against you in a future discussion where you are right.
