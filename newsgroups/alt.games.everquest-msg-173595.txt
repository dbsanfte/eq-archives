Someone posted that the correct duration of the spell is 7 tics, and it was
lasting 7 minutes.

7 tics is 42 seconds, more than adequate for any pulling job or to move past
most guards (such as the ones at Kael Arena) but won't be usuable for getting a
whole raid past a lot of content in a row without a lot of care; it will be
wearing off mobs before you get all that far.

The other thing that won't work as well anymore is the infamous "cleric mez"
where we root, pacification, atone, reducing aggro range to zero and then wiping
memory meant that the mob wouldn't come "back to life" other than perhaps to
wander off for quite a long time, no matter what you did near them.  Now that
"mez" will last at most 42 seconds, so chanter mez will be preferable again in
most cases (still useful on giants, of course chanters get the same lines and
can do the trick at a lower level)
