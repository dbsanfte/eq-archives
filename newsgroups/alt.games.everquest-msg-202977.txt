    With capped stats from items, no shaman race will have an advantage in
these areas.

    Advantages, by race, at level 65:

Ogre: no stuns from frontal attacks, infravision, Slam, can use the JBB.
Barbarian: better overall faction, Slam, can use the JBB.
Troll: enhanced regen rate, infravision, Slam, can use the JBB, has access
to an infinite-charge snare item (depending on religion).
Froglok: better overall faction, infravision, can use the JBB.
Iksar: higher innate AC, infravision, enhanced regen rate.

    Being able to use a JBB isn't so great by level 65, although it is a
perk. The shaman can cast Acumen on themselves at 65, so vision also isn't a
huge issue. Slam is near-useless by level 65. Overall faction is also a
non-issue, as supplies can be obtained in a number of places. So really, the
advantages list is something like this:

Ogre: frontal stun immunity.
Troll: enhanced regen rate, access to snare item.
Iksar: higher innate AC, enhanced regen rate.

    The frogloks and barbarians may have an easier time getting to level 65
because of their advantages (faction, lower racial XP penalty), but once
you're at 65 it's the evil shamans that come out on top. Personally I'd
place troll shaman of Innoruuk above the others just because of how useful
that snare necklace is when soloing XP, but you can make a case for any of
the three.
