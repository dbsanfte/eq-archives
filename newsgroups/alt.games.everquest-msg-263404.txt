ARRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The PAIN! This bring 
back HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE nightmares of a life as a Cleric killing 
skeletons OVER AND OVER trying to get that bloody scythe for the Aegis 
of Life quest and then having to flee for my dear life even though I was 
max level at the time and having to call in a bard friend to help me 
kite the bastard around.

Man that quest SUCKED, but the reward was nice (for it's time it was 
like the best back item for a cleric).
