Well I just hit 29, so I'll see how it goes from here.  I'm thinking
it's probably a lot easier for a class that has the lull or harmony
line, or FD in MM (or someone with it in thier group) .  Lets see what
classes don't have that - shaman, wizard (been told they can solo fine
in mm though, don't know how), mage, rogue & warrior obviously - I don't
know what the hell beastlords have.

I have to admit I've hit the can't kill mobs indefinately spot in MM,
but so far I just ended up DA, run to zone and start from the top again,
and there have been some spawned near the entrance ready to kill again.

Not adds, I figured out to take them to the nethumbrian zone about
halfway through 26.  It still wasn't that great of xp.  It worked, but
it was booring, no loot, so-so xp (at least comming off of the paludal
rollercoaster it seemed that way) considering the time I was taking to
hunt one down and bring it back.  Well o.k. when no one was around in
Marus I got adds just running back to the zone.  If many people were
around I couldn't get anything to kill in a reasonable time.

What class?  Remember this is a cleric talking, not exactly uber damage.

I didn't try them when they were red because I didn't know how high they
were, but suffice it to say that without c3 I couldn't take a blue one,
they regenerate only slightly slower than I can output damage without
nuking much.  I *can* take things in mistmoor without c3, the difficulty
is in pulling one or separating one.
