I have just begun the Red Headband Quest in South Karana, and have been
unable to find the three gnolls I need to kill. There seems to be lots of
information about this quest on the internet, but most of it is dated and
contradictory.  Can any one give me up to date info on spawn location and rate.
Thanks
