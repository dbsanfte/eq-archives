Wouldnt call them that interesting to XP on. At level 57, my druid (KEI 
and epic) spend around 25 min killing one. Then you need to spend a few 
min medding up, then find next, or even worse, go kill the PHs.
XP a kill (after the XP boost), 1/3 blue a kill. That mean around 90 min 
of kill/medup time, and then not counting the time to pull them, kill 
PHs and the like.
XP on othmirs with KEI (note, before harmony nerf), 1 blue a hour, 
including med time. So imo, ï¿½ce Burrowers are only worth hunting for the 
tunic or the silk, which both are kinda rare, silks drop 2 silk on 
around every 3rd burrowers, have to see a tunic after 24 dead burrowers.
