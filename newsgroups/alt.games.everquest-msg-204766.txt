OMG you have the same Range slot as my level 34 Enchanter.
That just stunns me.

Is hive fiend's brain really that good that it will last me to 65 ?
Was it that good a buy ? 1300pp

I'm not taking the piss, it just amazes me that anyone at 65th has any 
equipment the same as one of my lowly chars.

Wow, I just got round to looking at your other items.
You are getto aren't you.
I sold my errudie heart and got a Stone Bead Choaker not much of an upgrade 
for you but my chanter likes the Cha. Many of your other items are on my 
"may upgrade to this some time soon list".

I guess that partly this could be the FV effect that sees nodrops for sale. 
Since Stave of Wit is on my list of "This could be my first 2hb"

I'm really not trying to dis you (I mean your 65th something I will never 
be) I just always thought that Equipment would have more effect on stuff. I 
mean you AC, HP and Mana are more than mine, but not *hugely*. Your int is 
about the same and you have no FT. Does this character play OK in a group 
at 65 ? Or do you notice mana pool / regen / sudden death problems ?

Just interested and confused, really really not trying to poke fun.

Here is my magelo so you can laugh at me.
