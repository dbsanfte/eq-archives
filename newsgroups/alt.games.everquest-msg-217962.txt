But when the GM tells me to contact SOE directly to have problem corrected
and SOE sends me an email blowing me off...that's BS.  SOE does have the
power to correct their bug.  Why have a GM tell me to do something for no
reason, I'd rather just had him say "Nope, sorry, you're hosed..." rather
than tell me to email direct to have it fixed just to get a brush off.

I don't buy into your answer.  I work for a computer hardware manufacturer.
As a manufacturer of a product, you DO have the ability to fix a problem
caused on your part.  If you make a buggy product...you don't just tell a
customer "oops, yeah well, that is a bug we've seen several times...oh
well...even though we make the product and constantly update it...sorry,
nothing we can do for you".  If the GM has the ability to fix the problem is
not the issue.  The issue is the in game GM told me to go to EQ site and
contact direct to have the problem corrected.  I refuse to believe that the
creator of this game cannot do something as trivial as awarding points that
were earned and not given.
