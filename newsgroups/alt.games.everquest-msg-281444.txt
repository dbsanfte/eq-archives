Other than the option is available to everyone who bought DoD ...

Suddenly it's not only the deeply flagged (PoFire-PoP, KT-GoD), solid good
group layout (MPG, RSS, Nest), well equipped kiter (Vxed), who can earn the
xp those groups always used to 'brag' about.

The real problem that I see with monster missions, is that in a few weeks
we're going to be swamped with people who went from 40 to 70 in a chosen
class, by doing something other than playing that class.  It'll be tough to
group with those people when they finally step out of the missions and into
normal xp zones.

Our guildies fall into roughly 3 categories,

1. Players who are chain completing 1 or 2 monster missions, or rotating 2
or 3 of their toons through the same one over and over again.  In many
cases they're doing this in full groups, without any 'afk' members.

2. Players who are completing monster missions and trying to do all of them
at least once, perhaps doing 1 or 2 over until particular characters get
the piece of loot they're after.

3. Players who hate the idea of monster missions and are still xp'ing in
their traditional way.

No one in our guild has left the game because of monster missions.
