Technically yes - you did kill steal. Practically - you were all at fault
and a bunch of putz's, but he only broke ettiquite (ie, was a jackass)
whereas your entire group not only proved they were also jackasses, but also
broke the enforcable rules.

If he did report you though, I suspect the GM would have watched, then left
after coming to the conclusion that you guys deserved each other.

It is just like here in Australia it is illegal to hit another person, yet
if you ring up the coppers and say your girlfriend just hit you then they
will just laugh at you.
