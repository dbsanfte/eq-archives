ALL class penalties were *removed.

*In oder to "remove" the class penalties they coded in an exp bonus
for each kill. For example SKs used to have a 20% class exp penalty.
So a troll SK used to have a total exp penalty of 40% (20% race + 20%
class = 40% penalty per kill). Now every time a SK kills a mob they
get a 20% exp bonus (20% race + 20% class - 20% Bonus = 20% total
penalty per kill), thus mitigating the class penalty. So to the player
there is no class penalty at all.
