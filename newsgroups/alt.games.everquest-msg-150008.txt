I'm not going to read replies as this is a guild-by-guild thing, I think.
I'll answer for my guild.  We're not end-game stuff, we've just killed
Ragefire for the first time, but have done Ixiblat (aka FixaFlat), the big
elemental in BW and Faydedar a good dozen times each (at least!).  We've
successfully cleared Fear (including golems but not CT) and Hate (not Inny)
and have gotten through Isle 5 in Air (ran out of time).  As any uberguilder
will tell you, we're n00bs.  Average level of mains is about 52.  We're a
social guild that raids.  We're not, nor ever will be, a raid guild.

Loot is usually handled by one person on the raid with the input of group
leaders.  I'm usually the loot guy.  It's NOT a democracy of group leaders,
I only get their input.  Assuming it's normal loot I usually base it on raid
participation.  A cleric that goes to Fear all the time not getting any loot
will likely be near the top of my list for loot in Hate.  Druids who go to
Fear (where druid stuff drops) but doesn't go to Hate (both are assuming
that this is consistent behavior) are lower on the list.

Epic pieces are harder.  If the person who needs the piece is leading the
raid, they get it...hands down, they get it.  No discussion...their raid,
their epic.  For other epic pieces it usually depends on how far the person
is into their epic.  If a new member just needs that piece left but someone
else in the guild's been with us a year and still needs 4 pieces, the new
guy will get it.  We encourage people to organize their own epic raids. ;)

Rarely even an issue.  At the upper end of the game ninja looters are few &
far between.  If there's a particularly rare component, though, someone will
lock down the corpse until the correct person can loot it...if there's a
stranger in zone.

One of our guildies created a critter called "Rottings."  Any time a piece
is going to rot he says in /guildsay "WOOT!  MORE LOOT FOR ME!!" <g>  He's
gotten a LOT of gear (well, ok, he hasn't, but play along with the joke, ya
bastahd).

Uberest, no one should care about the xp.  It's a narrowly defined fight.
Get in, kill, get out.  It's not an xp camp.  For planar stuff, once it's
routine for you I'd recommend trying to balance out the groups for xp and
take as few groups as possible (5 groups for newbies, 4 for semi-newbies, 3
for experienced, one or two for pros)...but for stuff like gods & harder,
you make groups to win the battle above all else.

I don't let it bother me.  Screw 'em if they're greedy.
