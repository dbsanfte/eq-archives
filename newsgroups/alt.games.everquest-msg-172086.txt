I have fought, both solo and grouped, in all those areas. Far and away
the most I found were in skyfire off the chromos. And because of their
debuff, lots of folks don't want to hunt them, so they are often

Your best bet is just to offer a good price and keep hanging out there
when you find groups hunting and try to get somebody who will save them
for you.
