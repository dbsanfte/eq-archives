I have to agree with one of the other replay on this one.  It is a problem
with the AMD and EQ.  There was a patch a while back that completely messed
up my playing just like the original poster.  I called Sony and they said it
was the AMD processor.  Couple days later there was a new patch and I could
play fine on my 450 machine but the 500 machine was still buggy.  I do hope
they can figure out what the problem is soon.  It's not a cooling problem
for me either since I have a seperate fan for the processor and vid cards in
both machines.  Just one of them things I guess...
