It works 100% of the time for me when I type /camp desktop.
It works just like /camp if I type /camp destkop. :)

No such command.  There's /camp (takes you to char), /camp server (server
screen) and /camp desktop (all the way out).

BTW, I'm nowhere near alone in this (though I don't know if the problem is
universal).  If you're running Win9x and you do /camp desktop,  - once
you're out of the game - if you hit the Start button to shut down your
computer, it will lock up.  Some weird memory problem I think.  The
workaround is to crank up any program that's easily accessible WITHOUT
hitting the Start button first.  Then you can safely shut down.  I always
use IE as that program.
