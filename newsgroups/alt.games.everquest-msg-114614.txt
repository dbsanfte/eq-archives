Well, to be fair, lemme play devil's advocate...  I can't say -anything-
about having to ask for healing...  Any healer class worth their salt should
know when to heal...  And, if you were consistantly dropping to less than
one bub of health, then he had no reason to gripe when you got more people
in the group...  However, allow me to point out some other things:

Asking for Buffs:  When I first join, or form a group, I will fully buff up
each member appropriately.  Everyone gets sow.  buff the tanks, etc, regen
the necro and the tanks, etc...  I usually have Wolf-Form up.  Wolf-Form
lasts longer than Sow... I will have to be reminded when buffs drop so that
I can refresh them.  I often don't cast the same buffs on myself.  To me,
it's a service when you -remind- me... After all, the tank is there to take
the damage that I cannot take... It's in my own best interest to keep the
tank buffed.  :)

Pulling:  Actually, if PLAYED properly, druids -rock- at pulling.  I pull
for my usual group all the time...  Rush in, snare, pull back.  If the mob I
want is in the middle of a group of others that will aggro, that's what
Harmony is for (unless I'm in an indoor zone...).  If I get an add, I'll
snare the add, bring the one I meant to pull in, for the party to kill,
while I keep the add(s) busy, running it around, and, when the party is
ready, I'll bring the add(s) in.  I'll have you know I have not led to
anyone's deaths (other than my own) by my pulls... And when I die, it's
usually because of something spawning right on top of me... Heh... :)

Just my own 2 cp there... :)  But you're right... that Druid, I would have
tossed from my group LONG ago...  Pulling the entire camp, not healing in a
timely fashion...  And Druids are not nearly as good healers as Clerics...
That is becoming painfully clear at level 47... I'm barely able to keep up
with the tank's damage...  but have a 37 cleric in the group, and NOOOOO
problems... LOL
