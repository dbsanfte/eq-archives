This is indeed a funny story, but I have to wonder just how
accurate it is...

While it would be expected for a hostile KoS-to-all NPC to charm
person A and send them after person B, the question here is why
would the peaceful gypsy enchantress, after getting understandably
ticked off at person A for using an AoE mez by accident, then use
person A to attack person *B*, the gnome whose existence she didn't
mind at all when he was fighting the bear near her?

Otherwise peaceful NPCs don't go on a rampage against everyone
in the neighborhood just because one person begins hostilities
against them.
