best one i begger senerio i have been a part of but not the begging end was
when i was trying out a DE SK for the first time and i am trying to talk to
the guy in commens to get the patterns and information i need so i know what
to get for the Bone mail armor
and this lvl 1 warrior is shouting in the zone over and over again for
someone to please help him with some plat..

so i finally got tired of it and shouted for him to shut up that some of us
low lvl's are tryint to read some quest info so we can get our own damn
stuff

and about 2 minutes later a high lvl SK walks up and dumps a full suit of
bone mail on me and says good job and walks away

life is amazing sometimes
