Yeah, we agree, it's *still* FCFS.   Having a cleric there
with four friends isn't likely to be considered a capable
force by either other guilds or a guide/GM if they get
involved.  And having your entire guild bound there or
camped out there doesn't help when he spawns and another
guild ports in, pulls, kills, loots, and ports out while
you're still going through your call tree at 5am...
