Here, I've fixed your ".sig" for you:

----------------------------- Cut 8< here -----------------------------
-- 
This e-mail, which is not an e-mail at all, but is in fact a Usenet
message, and any attachments are posted to a worldwide computer
network, and readable by anyone who wants to. And many who don't want
to, until they place its sender in their bozo bin. If you are not the
intended recipient you should stop pretending to be a Usenet server
and start pretending to be an FTP server or something, I don't know.
If you have received it in error please notify the sender of his
problems differentiating between e-mail and Usenet.

This e-mail and any attachments are believed to be virus free but it is
the recipients responsibility to ensure that they hunt down and beat
the stuffing out of the sender if they aren't. Alternatively, the
recipients could just use a plain newsreader which doesn't
automagically decode and execute arbitrary attachments without user
interaction.
--------------------------- Cut 8< here too ---------------------------

There, isn't that much better? A proper .sig delimiter and everything!
It got a bit longer, but I saw that you weren't really a McQuarry fan
anyway.
