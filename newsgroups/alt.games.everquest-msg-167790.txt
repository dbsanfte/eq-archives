And in that vein....

I doubt pretty seriously that I would allow my child(ren) to play EQ in the
first place, PvP or otherwise. There is far too much input of time time
required to fully enjoy the game. Perhaps it could be integrated into a
family activity in limited amounts, but I think I would opt to exclude it
for more constructive family activity.

Kids need to be out being kids. They have the rest of their lives to sit
infront of a CRT for hours on end, and need to spend their younger years
doing kid things. Staying ahead in school, making *real* friendships, being
in Boy/Girl Scouts, Athletics, school clubs, toilet-papering their friends
houses, etc. You know, character-building kinds of things that will benefit
them as adults, the same way they benefitted me. And as much fun as EQ may
be, I don't see much character-building(no pun intended) potential in it.

I am the father of a 2-year old boy, incidentally.
