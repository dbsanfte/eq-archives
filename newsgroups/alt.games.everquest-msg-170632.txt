Death is a time sink for the group, not just for the individual who
dies. Preventing death where possible isn't just a hobby, its
enlightened self interest, and good team play.

Yes, its possible for them to learn in the school of hard knocks...
but its also possible to educate them via conversation.

The wizard in question was level 65, unless he was ebayed he must have
had some idea what he was about.  I've had many other casters tell me
not to bother buffing them, seen such advice here in the newsgroup and
in guild chats in several guilds too.

My general thinking is that more HP is always better than fewer HP,
and beyond a few levels back in my 40s, that the expense of a peridot
really isn't much compared to the lost time that deaths can incur.
Particularly once Aego and now Virtue are available, where thats a
peridot every couple hours, well, its a pittance.

But assuming you know what you are doing... do you know I'm liable to
steal a couple thousand of your HP at the drop of a hat?   I don't
think all that many people have experience with DvA just yet, because
many people I group with express surprise and confusion when I
suddenly leach off massive quantitites of their hit points.
