Why not let the cleric or enc pull?
I do it all the time,though it took some work to convince
people that both classes make great pullers,especially
the cleric with  his unbeleivable tanking capabilties.
At level 51 with 3k hps and 1k Ac selfbuffed,I laugh at
several  (normal)Ldon mobs pounding on me.
Find it weird,that he tanks so much better than my Ranger
at a comparable level.
