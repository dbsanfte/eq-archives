Nobody even dreamed of charging a monthly fee for a game until EQ1 came out. 
Since Verant proved people where willing to pay for it, now everyone else 
does.

FFXI proved people were willing to pay for additional characters, so now 
everyone else does.

It's pure business. They don't make and maintain the games for the love of 
the art. They do it for the money, plain and simple. If people are willing 
to pay for something, you bet there will be companies selling it.

I don't like it one bit, but I know there's nothing you or I can do about 
it:
1) I won't stop playing the game because of it (I like the game, duh).
2) I will have to think carefully what my alts will be because I certainly 
will NOT pay extra.
3) They won't change their minds because there WILL be people paying for it.
