Instead, you attacked him, implied that he had no money (which he
obviously does) and called *him* an asshole.

Jealousy, plain and simple.

In the real world money is always an object, and intelligent people
try to get the most value for their money.

AMD sells plenty of chips, wonder who is buying the underpowered
things?

Riiiight. Sure. If I was as dumb as you and made purchases based on
past performance instead of current, I'd buy nothing except NEC chips,
because the V20 beat the crap out of the 8088 and was much cheaper.

Face it, you're an Intel bigot, pure and simple. Nothing wrong with
that, I was one for years myself. But at least have the balls to admit
it, rather than tearing someone else down because he didn't pick the
chip you would.
