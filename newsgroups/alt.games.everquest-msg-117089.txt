    There are multiple guilds on Xegony that were capable of waking the
Sleeper (first tier for the server). Congrats Inner Circle, they now all
hate you. You want any mob? You better all be /anon, because if another
guild sees you massing they're going to race you out of spite. Or block you
by killing key-bearing mobs before you can. Or any one of a million
different tactics designed to mess you up. (My favourite that happened to a
guild on our server with a trashed rep: some flurry drakes were "left" in
the Rotunda on a day when it was known they were going to head up and try to
set up a CotH past Aaryonar.)

    Worse, they can't attract recruits with morals. One guild that had rep
issues in the past is seeing the results now. Any time their people can gain
more elsewhere - Stormhammer, or cross-server transfers to FoH - they go.
The guild has low loyalty, the moral people who are left are starting to
defect to guilds like my guild, and until recently (when they cleaned up
their act) the people that would recruit with them would best be described
as massive lootwhores.

    You never know what playerauctions.com will bring, either. Players leave
EQ all the time, even in top-tier guilds. When they go, the person you
recruit will more than likely not have the gear the person that left had. So
you're going to need to bring them up to par. Primal is an irreplaceable
part of gearing up a melee. Our guild would like nothing better than to
leave ST and never return, but at this point that's not an option just
because we have to gear recruits. And killing golems to get it is slow as
hell.
