No, they had her originally in east freeport at the dismal rage
trainers.

The problem which happened was that characters, like my ogre warrior
of rallos zek who had relocated to east freeport and raised dismal
rage faction to train in the sewers and was fine with all the npcs in
the sewers, who were previously fine there could be kos to driana
poxbourne who is on the bloodsabers or whatever of bertox faction. 

Verant decided that even though they can be real bastards and totally
screw people over that this was kind of a bit too much (in my case I
could not get to this trainer to train at all... and having relocated
at level 2 running to ogguk to train more would have been hard and I
had no way yet to raise faction enough with neriak warrior guild
really) so they moved her to west freeport sewer where really you can
pretty much avoid her. 

My troll sk found her in west freeport and camped her for a while when
she was a blue con, just to get revenge. Her spawn time is kind of too
long though.
