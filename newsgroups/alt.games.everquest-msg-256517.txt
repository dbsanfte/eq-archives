If not resisted, 1 2/3 DPS.  It's not much but then people have been
known to pay thousand and thousands for similar improvements.

Just pulling a number out of my ass, assume that those things you were
fighting the other day to test out your DS had 5000 hitpoints.  They
lost 4 or 5% while beating on you for the length of one battle, right?
 If 5%, that's 250 hitpoints lost to your DS.  That's a little over 4
DPS.  The 1 2/3 DPS may not seem like much but the DS DPS isn't much
more...Too many damn acronyms.
