Druids get mana regen at 54 (Form of the Howler).  It's 2 mana/tick.
Harvest starts at about 170 mana every 10 minutes at level 34, and
increases to 301 mana every 10 minutes at level 60, so Harvest reaches 3
mana/tick.  I believe Breeze is 2 mana/tick.  Clarity 2 is, I believe 11
mana/tick.

(For comparison, at mid 40's, I was getting about 25 mana/tick from
medding).

Spirit of Oak at 59 also has mana regen, at 4 mana/tick.

While I agree with you that Wizards should not get a mana drain spell,
your reasoning is silly, and is the kind of thing class balancing
discussion always degenerates into.  Whether or not Enchanters should
get better nukes (or better anything else) has nothing to do with what
Wizards should or should not get...it only has to do with whether or not
Enchanters are underpowered and need improvement.  Most spell abilities
in EQ are shared among multiple classes, so no class really should be
upset if another class gets one of their abilities.  What differentiates
the classes is the combinations of abilities they get, and a class
should only be bitching if another class is mostly a superset of them.
