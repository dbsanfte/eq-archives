True; But as a level 54 ranger I can tell its worth keeping your
piercing up too. Getting it up from 3 to 210 at level 52 when
you get a lupine sucks ;)

Especially when you sheepishly explain to your groups that your
piercing is only 23, and would they mind very much if you used
this nice new dagger to get it up.... ;-)
