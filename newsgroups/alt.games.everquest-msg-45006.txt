It does. I did exactly the same thing myelf... camped my bard down in the
sup room. Used my other char bound in guk to sus out who was camping the
room, and send me a tell when it drops. I can be off earning xp while
waiting for my mask.

I had to wait for a couple of other guys who were camping it for an alt of
theirs, camped in that room.
