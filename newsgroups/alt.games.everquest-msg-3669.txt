I addition to the other advice you received, remember a couple things.
Even at level 7, you have a lot of hit points. If someone attacked
you, unless they were unleashing a high level spell, or they were
rooting you, it is very unlikely they will kill you. Secondly, you
cannot lose experience while fighting players in the arena. The worst
thing that will happen is you will have to make a corpse run. If they
were still there and killed you a second time, they would be guilty of
corpse camping, a petitionable offence. So you can just run straight
through, though I personally would have stopped to watch the show.
