I've soloed an enchanter to 24, wizard to 26, and shammy to 51.

These are the reasons I prefer to solo and almost never group:

1) I can't stand the idea that some mistake I might make could get
   someone else killed.  Just the fact that it's a possibility takes
   the fun out for me.

2) My RL situation demands that I often leave the keyboard, sometimes
   on short notice.  That's no problem if I'm soloing but potentially
   a big inconvenience for a group.

3) Group action is just too fast for me.  I prefer a slower pace.

4) When grouping I don't get to pick the targets, and I don't get
   to decide where to rest, etc.  I'm a very cautious player and
   groups don't like that style.

There are plenty of social aspects to the game besides grouping,
such as buying/selling, guilds, buffing, helping find corpses, sharing
information, etc.  Some people seem to think that if you're soloing
you might as well play a game that's not massively multi-player,
but that's just not true.
