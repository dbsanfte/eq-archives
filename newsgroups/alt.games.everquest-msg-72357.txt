Not likely. I have a router and all is fine on three machines.  Verant does
give info on the ports but they're all initiated on your side of  router so
it shouldn't be an issue.  You could place your machine in the DMZ and see
if the problem goes away.  If it does, it's the router. Then the question is
what's the cure.
