Hi All,
  I have got a level 46 Assassin character and seem to be in the situation 
where my quest log is full of quests that I can't do. Even the greyed out 
ones seem to be impossible to achieve. It seems to me that the level marking 
for quests is out by a large factor? A good example is a recent level 43 
quest to kill some goblin warriors in Lavastorm. You get there and find 
that, yes, they are level 43, but they are heroic! This makes the quest a 
non-viable one unless I get a group together.

  I don't mind hard quests, but they should either be marked properly at a 
level where there is balance or in the case of the above example it should 
be marked as heroic.

  Its a pain in the a having to look through a full quest log only to find 
that despite the alleged level requirements, none of them are achievable!
