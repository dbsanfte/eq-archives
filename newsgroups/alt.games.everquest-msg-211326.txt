I am in a guild where I am the only shaman with Fo7, which the guild 
purchased for me, so, I do feel some obligation there.  It will make my 
life a lot easier at the beginning of a raid.  We only have 4 shaman 
total in the guild, one is level 57, rarely played, one is 64, going on 
65, and the other is 65, but no Fo7, so, ends up MGBing stamina.

Yes, it is a no brainer, and it was first on my list originally, 
particularly since MC2 and MC3 are on the way there, and while pricey, 
still a couple more mana regen all the time is not a bad thing.

I don't have Torpor or Quiescense, and I use my incomplete heal with 
canni, as it's more mana efficient that Stoicism.  There is no question 
that I would be better off in any outdoor zone with a mount, but, I was 
finding that I was not using it enough at the time to justify the cost.  
I was spending most of my time indoors, or soloing in PoN, where most of 
the time was spent sitting around waiting for a DoT to wear off or root 
to wear off.

It wasn't just one spell, that is the last one of the relatively 
affordable ones on my list.  I did have a mount when I did the trials.  I 
actually have a borrowed Fungi already, so I am set there.

I found in the end that the mount was annoying enough that I didn't use 
it as much as I thought I would.  Most of the raids I am on tend to be 
indoors still, and other than when I am playing around, I tend to solo in 
indoors zones as well.
