I guess I should be more clear. There was a long standing bug with
factions that would stop moving one way or another when a mob gave
multiple factions, so if you were trying to raise x faction and y
faction hit the lowest it could go, it was then impossible to raise x
faction any higher (frogloks of guk, undead frogloks was a good
example). This made repairing live froglok faction by killing undead
ones impossible because you bottomed out undead long before you could
fix live. This bug was only fixed before Velious, so, presumably, they
intended all factions to be lowered and then raised again.

While it may not have fit from a role playing point of view, it was
really at least slightly more creative than the mind numbing key camps
that slowed a guild's "progress" through Kunark and Velious.
