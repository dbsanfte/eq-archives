Lol, how 'bout if I offered a stack of bandaids :-P

I wish I had something to trade for clarity sometimes.
I must admit though, I have to shake my head over some
folks I know (my RL buddy comes to mind).  I went 45
levels without ever seeking out a clarity while solo,
and never seeking out a rez.  Some of these people act
like they're going to perish if they can't get them.

In fact, the only rez I got up to 45 was an unsolicited
one while getting focus item components in Najena, I'd
lost 29 (teach me to mess around in an unfamiliar dungeon
after just getting a spell level) and a cleric who was
pl'ing someone saw me go down.  Just as I zone in to my
bind point I get a tell "Have a seat, relax, rez incoming
when mana permits."   Nice person.
