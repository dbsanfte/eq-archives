Nope.  When I read that "if your account is hacked you will be
banned" crap, I was astounded at the "you are guilty and cannot
be proven innocent" attitude that Verant has taken.

NO system is unhackable.  Period.  For Verant to assume that ANY
hacking that occurs is due to you posting your account and password
to some chat board (or something equally stupid) is outrageous.  As
you said, I think that most people who play EQ have invested a LOT
of time and effort in their chars, and they aren't going to "share"
their password around.

Consider the hacking that occured with Diablo 2.  Blizzard took the
precautions they thought would be required to safeguard the D2 chars
from hacking, yet someone figured it out and was raiding people's
accounts.

Personally, I find it purely disgusting how Verant treats the players
who allow them to enjoy excessive amounts of profit each month.  I'm
not a "Verant sux" evangelist either -- I haven't had any problems
with Verant AT ALL -- I just don't like their attitude in that
particular document.  It seems that they should be interested in
helping people.  I know they can't restore items since that would
lead to people lying about "losing" items, but they can at least
be civil and help you change your password and not threaten to cut
your head off/ban you because of a security flaw that just might
really be their own problem.

BTW, if anyone thinks that Verant has created a super secure
environment, just take a look around the web for the "hacker" tools
to see the reality of the situation...
