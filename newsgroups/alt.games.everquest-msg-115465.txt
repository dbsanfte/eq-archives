They are the "convenient stereotype" of a halfling from high fantasy
NOT Tolkein's universe.

You cannot hold them (VI) to a Tolkein stereotype. Halflings were
thieves (racial klepto's) and wandering adventurers in the Dragonlance
series. Why do you insist on "Tolkein" as the sole basis for
"halfling" lore and culture in EQ?

No, all three (Halfling, Human, and Wood-Elf). You could argue just as
strongly that Halflings should have had Rangers from day 1 of EQ's
launch.

According to you. Verant has written them into the world of Norrath.
You know, the world they create and control. Iksar and Vah Shir did
not exist when EQ launched. I don't see you bitching about them being
added.

The halflings in DragonLance are NOT Tolkein "ripoffs". The D&D
halflings are not either, if you are familiar with the game system and
lore.

But your whole argument is based on the fact that there Tolkein
Hobbits could never be Rangers due to temperment. That same temperment
(as described in the books) would also be contrary to a thief
class/profession, as well as a Druid priest class that travels the
world on the wings of magic. You cannot have it both ways. If you
accept ANY of the Halfling classes in EQ (which are all contrary to
Tolkein in some respect) you have to accept Rangers.

There is also no mention of halfling Rangers....."Which means you
can't draw any conclusions about such."

You cannot have it both ways. Magic is an issue here. You have a rabid
dislike for Halfling Rangers, because they are "contrary" to Tolkein's
work, yet you then go on to cast aside the MOST significant difference
between the two worlds? I am sorry, but that doesn't wash. You cannot
pick and choose your differences (Halfling Temperment= No
Rangers.....Magic is a non-issue). Your whole argument falls apart
when you do this

Where has EQ deviated from their own stereotype for the Halfling Race?
From day 1 Halflings in EQ have been
fighters/healers/adventurers/explorers (War/Dru/Clr/Rog). Rangers fit
the EQ stereotype of the Halfling race perfectly.

Now we see the real problem. Halfling Rangers make perfect sense in
the world of Norrath. Yet you insist on holding them to a Tolkein
model and benchmark that they NEVER were intended to match. You are
simply  jealous of thier race/class stats and bonuses. I think it is
obvious that you are blinded by this and refuse to look at the issue
objectively.
