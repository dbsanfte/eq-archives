I use the Silvery War Axe in my off hand, with a set of Icetooth's Claws in
the main. Not bad, decent damage and respectable delays on both.

But rather than keep using the shield, why not grab a nice low delay item to
get your skill moving fast? The Gnoll Hide Lariat is great for that sort of
thing. It's a rotten little weapon as far as damage goes, and the proc will
be useless to you, but the delay is only 22, meaning fairly fast increases.

You could also take a trip to The Warrens and snag yourself a Packmaster's
Lash. It's a 4/23, or something like that. I know the delay is just 23,
which is decent for quick increases.

Either way, ditch the shield and get something for your off hand while you
search for "the one" item you want to use.
