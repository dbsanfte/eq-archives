Well, to be fair, it was mostly scheduling conflicts.  See, I usually logged 
in after nightly raids had begun, and they usually logged after those raids. 
Plus they were kept busy with their own tasks.

Still, I was mildly hurt by the fact that they weren't much willing to put 
out a special effort for me.

One guy, a cleric in my old guild who is the nicest guy in the world, ran 
into me in Wall of Slaughter and said he'd help me get my signets.  We made 
an appointment to get together one day, and I waited patiently for him, but 
he never showed.  That happened to be the same day the other guild I applied 
to sent me a guildinvite.  He later apologized and said work had held him 
up.  By that time, though, the other guild had already given me loot and 
helped me with signets, so I felt indebted to them.  And they deserve my 
loyalty for being willing to help out when the other guild clearly wasn't.

I still have mixed feelings about the whole situation.  If only I had run 
into that cleric a week or two sooner, I'm certain I'd be a part of that 
guild and raiding with my fellow ex-Drinaleans.  But the guild I'm with now 
is the one that's helped me out, and they truly seem like a bunch of nice 
guys and have made me feel very welcome so far.  So I'll be sticking with 
them for as long as they'll have me.
