I have been using an ASSIST key, during group fighting, with the
following syntax for a long time:

>/assist
>/g Assisting %t

My method of use is to click on the Main in the group window, and
click the ASSIST button after he/she has started the attack.

The announcement would be made Soandso Assisting Dojigger on a
Buggerbear, or something like that, and auto attack would be initiated
on Soandso's target.

Doesn't seem to work anymore... The attack is initiated on the MOB,
but the anointment is now... Soandsos is assisting a Buggerbear or
something like that.

Have I inadvertently changed the Hot Box syntax someway..oris there
more to the story?
