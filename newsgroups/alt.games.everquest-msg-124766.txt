Thanks for the post. I know the link you posted but it has no link to the
install file which they kept hidden 'cos yes they don't want unclued people
having access. I reiterate I don't wanna use it, seen it running on a
friends machine and it is plainly obvious that all verant has to do is go to
any of the contested rare spawns, like Bilge or AC etc. and spawn it
invisible to all players and nail the players who make a bee line for the
loc of where they spawn it. No brainer really and I don't know why Verant
don't do it more often, would certainly cut down on the playerauctions
gimps.

If you have the link to the install file would appreciate it
