I solo Cougars in Iceclad at level 37 (started at 36). I get almost 1 and a hafl
blue for every 4 cougars, spend 80-100% mana to kill those 4. I get a LOT more
XP out of it than killing maybe 2 blues on 1 full mana bar as i did earlier.
Only danger is adds, cougars are agressive and FAST, have had to run a few min
to get so far away that i could cast a gate (yep, with sow on).
But can only reccoment quadding, i dont think ill stop anytime soon.
