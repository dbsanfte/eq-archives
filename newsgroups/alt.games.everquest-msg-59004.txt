My main is a 56 dwarven cleric and I made it a duty of mine to never back
off when aggroed (at least until the mob was taunted off me or I could land
a root) and to jump into the fray each time I could (when not overrun by
hordes, when all group members are over 80% hp and when I`m FM).

This, of course, has constantly angered some people in my past groups but,
now that my defence and dodge are maxed, I am almost never interrupted when
healing, stunning, nuking, rooting or buffing while under attack unless it's
by multiple mobs (pops and adds).  Also, I can`t honestly say that I`ve
gotten anyone killed by doing this, not even myself.  Heck, I`ve died tons
of times because of bad pulls and never thought of asking tanks to stop
pulling.  Why should they ask me to refrain from bashing if I don`t ever get
them or myself killed!  Whether it be in Sebilis, Velketor or Chardok, I`ll
tell you that many a time I got the necessary casts of Remedy on the chanter
while a mob was trying to make friends with me.  CelH and CH on the tank
were seldom interrupted by a tenacious mob beating on me. Why? Because I can
take it.  Why?  Because I had previously and repeatedly gotten my nose
bloodied and my hands dirty.

Meanwhile, on raids, I often see higher level textbook,
sit-med-stand-heal-sit-med clerics getting their clocks cleaned and their
tanks killed because they have the offensive skills, defensive skills and
dodging abilities of a dim-witted punching bag.  However, now that my skills
are maxed, I can jump in just for the fun of it as I figure that any damage
I can deal without burning precious mana is a bonus for the group,
*especially* when I`m in mana-friendly chain-stun mode.  Anyway, what is
Divine Aura for! )  Don`t wait until you`re camping the Captain in Karnor to
work on your combat skills, start now if you want to max them out
eventually.

Every now and then someone will still object to my participating in the
wail-fest but, after I ask them to just wait for me to prove that nobody in
the group will be endangered because of my active participation, they
usually come to see things in a different light.  Lets face it, we hit for
less than the pure melees, we dd for less than the pure casters but I`ll
still do either or both no matter what anyone has to say.

And I say, bash on! But be intelligent about it.
