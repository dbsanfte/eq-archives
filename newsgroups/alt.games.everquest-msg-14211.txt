Druids are not vegan. It is sometimes necessary to 'thin the herds', so to
speak, especially given the rate at which the little buggers spawn. Our duty
is to maintain the balance of nature, and death *is* a part of that balance.
And if we are culling the excess, why not make use of what remains? To do
otherwise would be disrespectful of the animals we have killed. My druid took
up tailoring and baking because NOT using meats and pelts herself would have
been an affront to the gods :-)
