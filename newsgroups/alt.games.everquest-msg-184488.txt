I would start with 4 and work my way up from that.

On another subject, note that you have the bare minimum amount of RAM to run
the game (after Luclin). While EQ will actually run with 128 (with all
models off), 256 is the minimum requirement. Sony actually recommends 512MB
or better.

Where I you, I would go ahead and up my memory before I did anything else.
It would not only improve EQ, it would improve everything you did on your
computer.
