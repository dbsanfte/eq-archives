While that is true, anyone that has been claiming that breaking the rules
(that is how it has always been phrased regarding names), is wrong, and
should never be done, would still not name a character against those rules.
Yes, I know they are "guidelines".  I do know that in Lokari's case, the
characters with the name are inactive, possibly deleted now, and she did not
know of the company when she chose the name.  Nevertheless, it is against
the guidelines, whether a GM chooses to enforce it or not.  Much like even
if I police officer chooses not to pull me over for going 5 MPH above the
speed limit, I am still breaking the law by doing so.

The only reason I even post in this thread is that there are those in this
newsgroup who have in the past been very vehement about the subject of names
that break the rules, and, at least some of them, seem to be not quite so
vehement now, in the case of the example of a name like Lokari.
