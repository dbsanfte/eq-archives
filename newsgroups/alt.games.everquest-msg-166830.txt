}>>All of which are unintentional
}>Who says they are unintentional, you cretin. 
}Ah, so now you are calling spelling mistakes intentional?

No, he's saying that misspellings are not necessarily unintentional.  Typo, 
sure, unintentional by definition.  Spelling mistake, again, yes, 
unintentional.  Misspelling?  Not so.  Consider "Pleeeeeeease?"  Is it 
properly spelled?  Do you think I put too many e's in it by accident?

Changing complete sentences?  Most likely intentional, unless I'm using one 
of those crappy mac keyboards. :)  And replacing random words?  Could be 
either, really.  Unintentional effect of not paying attention to what your 
spellchecker is doing, or intentional editing, or intentional putting of 
the writing sample through a filter program that changes every third verb 
to 'splurt'.

}>You really don't know whats going on, do you?
}I am more on top of this in my sleep than you are on your best day,
}noob. :-)

I don't think either of you has the foggiest what the other is trying to 
say anymore.  It'd be a miracle if you knew what you were saying yourself, 
rather than just mindlessly disagreeing.  "Are you here for a 5 minute 
argument, or the full half hour?"

Not that it's important, really.  But I disagree with Taras on principle. 
:)

Yup, and humans survived without motorcars, computers, nylon, and EQ for 
thousands of years, too.  Should we chuck them as well?  Sure, we don't 
-need- them.  Let's pare things down to the bare necessities, shall we?

Yes, he did.

}>>Are you now claiming you're not being pompous?

}>Derrida

See?  Can't get much more pompous than Derrida.  On a side note, that 
bastard hit on my ex-girlfriend's officemate.  Isn't gossip fun?

}And yet, with a few simple words I reduce you to a quivering mass of
}silliness and vitriole. :-) The ease of which was unexpected,
}considering I was for the most part agreeing with you, other than one
}point. That makes it even funnier. :-)

Ah, this is the part of the flamewar where both sides declare victory on 
the grounds that they think the other party looks silly.  How original.

}>You like Bob Dylan?
}Not really.

Yeah, me either.  And he used to date my ex-mother in law's best friend.
It's a small world.
