Good resource.

I am pretty sure it was not the PC because it happened on 3 different
PC with 3 totally different configs. I tried many different scenarios
and it kept leading back to the ISP.  I am moving to a different area
in the near future and I might try them one more time.

Do you know what Global Service provider you went with?  Genuity or
Qwest?

DSL is a smother install and setup than cable modem; as long as I have
a phone jack in that room I can use it.
