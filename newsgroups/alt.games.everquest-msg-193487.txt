i wanted to make a character on a server besides saryn and seen that next to
the firiona vie server it says roleplaying preferred.

i like the sound of that. i was wondering do people overall role play there
characters on the server.
  And also are there any special rules or features i should be aware of? is
it PvP, can a good aligned character group with a bad aligned character,
diff item restrictions, etc.?
  thank you all in advance for any advice and help.
michial.
