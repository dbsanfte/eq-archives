Depends.

Solo? Then you want the laborer cave in TM.

Do you have a tracker? The kill any wandering aliens in TM.

Group in the high 40's and low 50's? Then you want AC.

In my experience the Grol Baku aliens wandering in TM tend
to drop the most bricks or ore. I even dropped one that had 4
bricks on him. Trouble is you really need a tracker for them there
is no camp of them.

Want a change of pace? Then try the Blood tribe in Scarlet desert.
They don't drop as much ore as the other places but may give you
better exp depending on your level.

The absolute best place? The Deep, no question. But you need 1
or 2 groups in the high 50's to even hold ground in there.
