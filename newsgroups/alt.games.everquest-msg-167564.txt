Spell cast on you: Your mind expands beyond the bounds of space and time.
Spell cast on someone: An orc centurion's mind expands beyond the bounds of
space and time.
Spell fades: Your mind returns to normal.

It is also called C3. Because you already have Clarity and Clarity II.(lvl
54 enchanter spell) You pay between 50-100pp for each cast on you. It makes
you mana regeneration go faster. Some people are addicted to it. (so am I)
Some even say cast it on a warrior or monk and he/she starts to pull much
smarter.
