I believe that, from a roleplaying aspect, you're doing the right thing.  In any case,
it's the polite thing to do.  You have my respect.

HOWEVER - don't ever tolerate crap from people who may be killed by one of your trains,
announced or not, as long as you weren't intentionally training them.  My way of looking
at folks who fight by the zonelines as insurance? "If you sit on the train tracks, you'll
get run over."

When fighting in popular areas, I try to keep a social hotkeyed, for train announcements.
It looks like this:

/gsay Zone out - Zone out - Zone out (hotkey)
/say Zone out - Zone out - Zone out (hotkey)
/shout Train to zone! (hotkey, specifics in a moment)
/ooc Train to zone! (hotkey, specifics in /shout in a moment)

Then, I follow it up with a /shout with the relevant zone (if necessary), and a MOB list
if possible.

I don't use this spammy social a unless I'm in a group.

If I'm soloing and become dangerously low on HP, I just high-tail it for the nearest
zoneline, drop a couple of /say while I run the MOB in circles, then zone out.

Best regards,

Tim ==
