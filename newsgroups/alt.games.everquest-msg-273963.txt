please note that in French no cat will ever be a coward.

please note that almost all french words for cowards refer to gay males 
or straight females.

please note that in French you will *never* call a woman using slang for 
her genitals. The only situation in which you call a man using slang for 
his genitals is "gland" (a stupid and lazy guy) which happens to be the 
tip of the penis.
