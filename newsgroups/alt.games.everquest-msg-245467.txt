Check Wizard sites.

Yes, it is mana-intensive.  However, you are killing 4 mobs instead of 1.
So, suppose a quad-kite burns twice the mana as a single kite.  You'll have
twice the downtime to get the mana back, but you'll have earned 4x the
experience, so you are way ahead.

For Wizards, that is basically the end of the calculation.  For Druids, you
have to also consider non-nuking options, like rooting and DOTing, which
allows you to sit and med while the mob is taking damage.  Or DOTing and
snaring and running far ahead with your nice fast SOW, and then medding
while the mobs catch up.  Wizards have snare, but our snare only lasts about
20% as long as yours, so even if we have jboots/tboots or someone has SOWed
us, this isn't nearly as good.

Anyway, getting back to AE nuke kiting, start with *one* mob.  Snare it four
times, and then kite it, using your AE nukes.  If you run out of mana before
it dies, be happy that you tried it with one before trying it with four!  If
it does die, note how much mana you have left.  Hopefully, it is enough for
a couple more snares or a root or an evac...this is your safety margin for
when something goes wrong, like you get an add, when you are dragging four
around.  If you can't kill a single mob with AE with adequate safety margin,
find a different kind of mob, with less HP.

Once you've found a mob you can do, try doing two of them.  Snare one, go
snare the other, and then bring them together.  The way you do that is by
running in circles around them, or by running along the perpendicular
bisector of the line between them.  AE nuke them to death, and make sure you
are happy with your mana, and that you have a feel for when mobs are close
enough to all be nuked.  Remember, every AE nuke that doesn't hit all the
mobs means you'll need to use extra mana at the end on that mob (remember
that when there is only one mob standing, your other spells are better than
AE).

(Wizards have AE snare, but it costs more mana than yours, and doesn't last
nearly as long, so when Wizards quad, we often do NOT start with snare.  We
aggro the four mobs, and get them into a circle, then AE snare them.  Keep
that in mind if you are sharing a quad area with Wizards.  They have more on
their minds during a quad pull than you, and so might not be as aware of
what others are doing as you would like...so take it on yourself to make
sure that you and they don't get in each others way)

After a few tries with two, start doing three or four.

Make sure that you keep any buffs you need refreshed, such as SOW.  With
your mobs snared, you can probably recast SOW if you need to...but SOW is
also your emergency escape if you get an add right at the end of a quad
where you've had some resists and are out of mana, and have to run for the
zone.
