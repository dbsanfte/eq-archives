It's interesting.  In the '92 elections, the division officers used to come
out at quarters that morning and practically drag squids to the voting
booths, they used to stuff absentee ballots down our throats.  "Voter's
Liberty" was common place on election day (and less painfull than "Vampire
Liberty" for giving blood).  That doesn't happen anymore.  From what I've
been told, Clinton, as commander-in-chief, squashed the military's *ahem*
aggressive voting drive.

Note, nobody was ever told how to vote; it was believed that it was almost a
crime to neglect a right that we put our lives on the line to defend.

The swallowed chads was my favorite story.  I don't know whether or not it's
true, but I had to laugh my arse off at it.

That's the one that got me.  Back in Jack Kennedy's day, they had the
decency to hide the strings when they were cheating.  This time, there was
no effort made.

Yet again, the Supreme Court comes up with another "Right answer, Wrong
reason."  It's not an issue of equal protection, it's an issue of the
Florida Supreme Court violating the Federal Constitution.  The Constitution
gives the right to determine the electors to the state legislators.  The
Florida SC tried to usurp that power, and the U.S. SC slapped them down.
