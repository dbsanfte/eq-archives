Yes,  I ran 3 on my Modem inbetween getting ISDN turned off and ADSL turned
on.
Make sure your modem isn't a software (or Win) Modem, otherwise you will
likely have problems.

I also think I used Jolt as my ISP for this (0845 dial up) as my 24/7 Free
one from Claranet wasn't particularly good, even on one account.

EQ is not a bandwidth intensive game, except loading zones, which will be
where any crashes/disconnects will occur. Don't confuse improved graphics
with increased network traffic, all the server does is tell your PC what to
draw, it doesn't have to send the information on how to do it, that's
already there.  There were some patches, after Luclin,  that dealt with
bandwidth issues but I believe most of them saved some "here" to use it
"there" no actual reduction.

I admit I did blame the Luclin expansion (or one of it's following
patches...there were quite a few) for my constant disconnects on ISDN, I was
actually unable to run 3 accounts on a single 64k ISDN channel shortly after
the SoL expansion and needed to use 128k for all 3 to be able to zone...This
turned out to be BT not EQ at all, as I started noticing problems playing Q3
as well and, like I said, when I had to use a Modem I was able to run 3
accounts without problems.
