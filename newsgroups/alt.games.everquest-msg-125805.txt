I've always thought some method of communicating with people in the game 
from outside it would be handy.  The old website used to report how many 
people were online on each server.  Since EQ takes about 10 minutes to load 
on my machine it's obviously a major undertaking to get online if you then 
find the person you're looking for isn't there.  It'd be nice to find out 
before starting, or be able to send them an instant message from outside 
which they would pick up inside if, say you only wanted to ask them 
something.
