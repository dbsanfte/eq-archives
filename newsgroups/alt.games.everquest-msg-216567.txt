ROFL....Or the idioticness of me driving a friend to an AA meeting 
mandated by the US Navy [because he got caught doing something idiotic 
while drunk, and the Navy will sentance people to AA, and restrict 
driving priveleges...] and everybody at the stupid meeting spending more 
time trying to force me to see that I was an alcoholic in full rampaging 
denial then trying to help people who were there because they had a 
drinking problem...i was inside because it was winter outside and i 
didnt feel like waiting in a cold car. I *don't* drink, it interferes 
with my pain meds and *i* would like to have my liver stay relatively 
intact...The most I ever drink is a sip toasting at a wedding, or if 
there is some in whatever food i order in a resteraunt or at a friends 
house.
aru
and i think lenny did the right thing, and if he had been 65 it still 
would have been the right thing for him=) Huzzas to him=)
