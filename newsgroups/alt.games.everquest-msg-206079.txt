It's all relative.  At L40 the dmg boost from a large STR boost is
still quite noticeable.  When I've parsed hits agains "normal" AC
mobs (i.e. dark blue cons in old world/kunark/velious) with a melee
who was near level cap in Offense/weapon and between the levels of
28 and 50 (that enough qualifiers for ya?) the average per hit has
been very close to ((min+max)/2) every time.

At L40 his dmg bonus isn't all that big yet, and his max hit with a
"normal" (120ish) STR is gonna be around 3x WeaponDmg.  Since STR
increases raise max by roughly ((StrIncrease*WeaponDmg)/100), a big
boost in STR will help his DPS noticeably.  It's true that as the
"level effect" and increasing skill levels raise his max damage and
the level-based damage bonus increases both min and max the boost
from +STR will be less and less significant relative to his total
damage output.  But at 40 he's still got plenty of time to play with
stats, why rain on his parade?  :-p  Besides, he's a Warrior.  So
much Warrior gear has +STR on it that even a wimpy Half Elf who put
his starting points into AGI ends up with a half-decent STR, you
could hardly avoid boosting STR as a Warrior if you tried.

Yeah, yeah, overall as a tank AC > HP > everything else.  Been there,
done that, ripped the t-shirt trying to put it on over my platemail.
But big hits are still fun, and EQ is still a game, so let him have
his fun.  ;)
