Well, but you see, that's not what DT said.  He acknowledged that you did 
15 years in the service, but by my reading it's your behaviour in this 
group that he sees as a disgrace.

}DT doesn't know me for shit but I willing to bet you wouldn't
}like him telling you that your a disgrace after all  of your time in
}service or your husbandsfor that matter. I just want to know on what

Everyone seems to be pissed at him this week for being a hothead.  If 
anyone's siding with him, you must be well and truly over some line, mate.
