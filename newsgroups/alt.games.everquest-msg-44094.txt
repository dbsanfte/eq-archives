OK, it's been a while for this topic, but I found myself in a group
this weekend that amazed me.  Every now and then a group works in
spite of itself, and sometimes you just get lucky.  My guild has been
working to get everyone a VP key, and the hardest part besides one of
Trakanon's teeth is the medallion that drops off of Verix Kylox's
Remains in the basement of Karnor's Castle.  When I have a bit of time
to kill and am in Kunark, I try to drag a group down there to kill him
and help guildies multiquest.  
The problem is that almost everyone in KC is afraid of the basement,
so you have to take what you can get.  We started in the courtyard
with cleric, shaman, monk, bard, then picked up two rogues.  I asked
if anyone wanted to go to the basement, and was able to convince folks
that I knew enough to keep them alive.  We worked our way to the
tunnel enterence, and as soon as we went into the tunnel, the cleric
gated out and disbanded.  I saw my guildleader coming towards the
basement, and convinced the group that a 59 necro can backup heal for
the shaman, and that he could single pull for us.  Oddly enough nobody
minded too much, though the monk said if he didn't have feign there
was no way he'd go in.  We start clearing easily, everyone is suprised
at how well it's going, when the shaman has a RL emergancy and has to
leave.  We aren't even much past the water tunnel, but instead of
giving up we pick up a second monk and continue to move forward.  We
clear the entire basement in about 15 minutes, and settle in to camp.
After we get a minute to catch our breath on of the rogues notices the
makeup of the group and about freaks.  We are now a necro, a bard, two
rogues, and two monks.  No healer, no buffer, no evacer, and we're
getting exp like these guys have never done before.  
We started joking about it and quickly figured out why we were so
successful, we literally were killing stuff before he could do any
real damage to us.  The necro would put a fast dot and root the mob,
the rogues and monks would swarm it, and I would slow, haste the
tanks, and sing catata to give necro mana and everyone else regen.
Even when we had 3 or 4 at once we were killing the first before I
could get the last one mezzed.  We were there for probably two hours,
not a single death, and killed Verix.
Of course the next day I went back with just the necro, a 57 monk, and
myself and we were able to break into Verix's room and camp it, but it
was exceedingly dicey and there was no way we could pull more than
Verix's room and the one next to it.  (We also had to let Verix's room
spawn if Verix was there, no way we could kill him without charming
his guards and sending them after him to take his health and mana.)
