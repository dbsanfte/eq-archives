Woodelf,
Thanks all for suggestions, given me some ideas on where to go. Don't really
want to spend plat on the character (rather spend it on my warrior, need
some cobalt boots)
Should crack 50 with my Warrior this weekend (I doubt that'll get my Druid
out of 45 but should be most of the way thru) then I'll start after some of
these items.
