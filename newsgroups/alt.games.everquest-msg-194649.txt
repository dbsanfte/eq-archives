Bards tend to get aggro before anyone when a pull comes in due to buffing
everyone as the mob runs up.  Also, if the MT dies, that bard has been
buffing 6 people (or in a raid, 30) for the entire time leading up to that. 
It seems the bard is right behind the overburning wizard and monster rogue
to get eaten after the MT dies.
