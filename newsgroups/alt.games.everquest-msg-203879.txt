Think you need to break that down into its 5 components.

Enchanter is the group MR buffer, but do they have targeted buffs 
for any other resists? Druid (+Ranger at high levels) is the group 
FR/CR buffer, Shaman (+Beastlord at high levels) is the group PR/DR 
buffer. Necros can buff PR nicely via DMF. Then you have Bards who 
put all of those to shame with their songs.
