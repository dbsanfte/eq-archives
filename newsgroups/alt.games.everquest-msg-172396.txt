Of course, the problem with camping the Grey is that it is airless and you need
EB to camp it, LOL.  Catch 22.  For a 48, a bit dangerous anyway.

I suggest you either camp Hadden or else buy an earring.  Then the problem is
solved forever.  And if you get a nice EB item (Lodizel Shield for instance has
an EB effect,even though I don't think wizzies can equip it, but there must be
something on that line for int casters), you can sell the earring for nice pp.
