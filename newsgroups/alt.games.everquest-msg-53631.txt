Oh yer funny, in fact, I'm in complete hysterics. Tour, yes you should tour
around the country with a vast wisdom like that. You'll have crowds,
cheering, praising your whit. Congratulations, your the only reply that
wasn't helpful. You win the asinine award for best non-supportive jerk in a
short message. Oh, and the checking of the usenet, man, you must be some
kind of l33t hax0r.

To all that atempeted to help or give insite: Thanks !! I got in touch with
Tech support, it was a mistake! Someone complained about someone else and I
ended up somehow with the account ban. Ahh, no matter...

Everone should praise and adorn the vast wisdom and compassion of the one I
call "Captain Imtool33tforj00". I came to the news group out of desperation,
looking for answers, not so much to rant. He is a model news group citizen
