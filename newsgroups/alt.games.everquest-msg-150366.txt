While I appreciate the thought, this wouldn't work,
several problems.

First, you'd need to make that
/target bergh corpse0
since the line
/target bergh
would target my live body (I'm obviously in the zone and nearer to
myself than my dead body is)

Second, if I'm dead, I won't have Rez memmed, not in slot 8, not
in any slot.  Take longer than 10 second pause to mem rez, even
without the load please wait time.

Third I suspect that death breaks hotkey progress.  If not I bet
Load Please Wait does anyway.

Fourth you want me to bind within rez distance of where I'm
fighting?

Fifth clerics don't die anyway.
