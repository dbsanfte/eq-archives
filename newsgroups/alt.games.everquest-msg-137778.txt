}There are a few other reptiles that do that, although I don't know how

Do you know of any specific ones?

}Fascinating concept.   I'm iffy on the details of parthenogenesis, 
}though-

Yeap, me too.  I better look it up. :)  Heheh, 

http://www.encyclopedia.com/html/p1/partheno.asp 

mentions it happening in bees, and 

http://www.orst.edu/Dept/animal-sciences/poultry/index.html

discusses birds. :)  

} how does the species ever exchange genetic
}material?   Or, to put it another way, how can California Whiptails
}evolve as a species if the individuals never exchange genetic
}material?

I've long been curious about that myself.  There would still be some 
background change just from random mutations, but I'd be suprised if they 
developed some other way to mix genes.  Still, the whole idea suprises me, 
so what's one more suprise? :)

}Oh sure, take all the fun out of it!   I know about the "ex-gay"
}movement, of course... and the "ex-ex-gays"  LOL.   But you have to
}admit its still a fun proposition to throw in the face of the
}homophobes who use the "choice" argument to justify themselves...
}usually results in a lot of indignant sputtering.

There's 'ex-ex-gays'?  Lol.  Were they Born Again? :)  yep, indignant 
sputtering is always good. :)

}Say, while on the subject, I've always wondered why people try so hard
}to isolate the gender we are attracted to from any other part of
}sexual orientation.  I have met plenty of bisexuals who say that like
}to do X with women, and Y with men, for example.   Then there's kink,
}and sex/romance vs. sex/physical activity.  You get the picture.  As
}tempting as it is to draw a line from "I like guys" to "I like gals"
}as a linear model of sexual orientation, I have to wonder how valid it
}really is to separate that axis from a more complete n-dimensional
}model of sexual orientation.

Yep.  I think some people just have a bit of trouble with that 
multivariate analysis thing. :) Maybe if we could describe our sexualities 
as n-dimensional vectors, we could categorize the most common clumps...

}Yikes, can you tell I was reading tech manuals all day?  Ignore me,
}I'll be much more normal after I get some sleep.

Oh, normal isn't any fun!  Stay up! :)  Lemme go find some links to some 
tech manuals. :)
