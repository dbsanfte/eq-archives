Trolls cannot be stunned from the front either.

Nope, it's STR. HOWEVER, the point which you are making is very true. It's
best to put some, if not most, of your points into STA as you'll benefit
from them in later levels.

Disagree entirely. Paladins are key damage-takers. No way is AGI a primary
stat for Warriors. Keep it above 75 for a newbie and then let it take care
of itself.

Pretty much true. Zing won't help your HP level, though. Only a shaman can
sort you out on that one, so unless you group with one regularly (and maybe
even if you do), it's worth thinking about.
