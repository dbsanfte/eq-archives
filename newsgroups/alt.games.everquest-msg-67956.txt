Can't speak for the zones, since I haven't bought Luclin, but it's supposed
to be an expansion more like Kunark, which has plenty of room to explore,
and can easily take a character from 1-60. Velious is entertaining if you've
got a guild that likes raiding, but if you don't raid, it's more or less a
wasted continent, aside from the tradeskilling benefits of Thurgadin, and
the stupid easy post-50 XP in Velketor's Labyrinth. :)
