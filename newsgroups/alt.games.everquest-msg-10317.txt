The way I was told to get to Kith from EC so long ago was to follow the left
(desert) wall all the way from EC to Kith as that was safer than following
the right one.   The first time I made the run was probably April of 1999
and I followed that advice and had no problem.  But I don't know when
Shadowed Men were added (assuming they were added after release).  The first
time I "saw" one was probably August 1999 in SK.  I doubt if I ran across
the ones in WC any earlier than 12/99.

Anyway, my point being, folks may still be giving out that advice.  I have
no idea if it's still valid though...I can't remember how far behind the
shadowed men the zone wall is.
