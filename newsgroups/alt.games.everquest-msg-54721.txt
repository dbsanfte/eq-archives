Might work, just be ready to run.

Sirens are prime hunting at 12, goblins start to green out at 13 or 14
though.

No idea here, only reason I want to go to Rathe Mtns is to camp a Mithril
Plated Girdle.

If it's the old Befallen, you'll do fine at 12, if its the new Befallen, RUN
AWAY. FAST.

Not too fond of this place, only time I tried to hunt here I got yelled at
by a bunch of people claiming every wisp on the island as "camped".

Prime undead smacking at 12 here too.  Stay til  about 20 in the basement,
you could even get a Solist's Icy wand or even.... an Iksar Berserker Club!
(and for the love of god don't give Jabober the club!)

Not really, the undead are too high, only thing for you is death beetles,
and then you'll still be sitting on the train tracks.

Not too many unused early teens places that you didn't mention, you might be
able to hunt in Warslik's woods though until 20 or so when you can start on
giants there.  At 30 you could hunt in Firiona Vie also, just avoid the
drixies, pilgrims, scouts and Vekis (actually, you could probably take a
drixie at 30, but they're VERY social)

You say you want to stay out of the Oasis/LoIO/OT/DL cycle, I don't blame
you about Oasis, that place sucks ass, but LoIO, at 12, has many undead you
can solo, easily, all you have to do is turn off /ooc and /shout and it's
like you're alone.  OT I don't care for because of the massive amount of
chain pulling, no rest whatsoever, as well as the heightened sense of
awareness needed to avoid goons, which I don't have with my nose in a
spellbook.  Never been to DL except 3 times, 1) get Gorenaired, 2) get
Gorenaired corpse back , 3) run like a mofo to the FM zone from port in, all
the while avoiding big cliffs, see invis giants/drachnids/drolvarg, and
Gorenaire.

Although, you could solo in the low level end of OT at 16 probably, I have
never seen anyone hunting there, and it's good exp up to 22/23 or so.

At 25 or so you could group to kill FM giants, but don't try solo, they have
a royal assload of HP, at 24 I could solo a low red Warsliks giant and have
2 bubbles of mana left, but a blue FM giant handed me my ass on a platter
between resists and too many HP to nuke him for with my limited (full at
start of fight) mana. (note: this is as a druid)

At 30 or so, move to Velious, you've got Cougars in Iceclad, Lots of undead
in ToFS (though you might need a group to help with the overpulls), Orcs in
CC( you can solo them at the zone in or down by the dwarves where there's no
wanderers or orcs within social aggro range), Tizmak or wolves in GD (or
Dorfs if you're interested in going Giant faction).

This is probably a bit disjunctured, but I wasn't really awake when I typed
it, but I hope you can understand it enough to help you, hehe.
