True, with one notable exception: Coldain Velium Weapons. You have to go to
Velious to actually buy one in the stores for 60-80pp, but they proc at lvl
1. The rest of it's stats are the same as normal Velium weapons though.

Decent twink item for not much pp, although for a newbie getting a high
level character to fetch one for you might cost a bit :)
