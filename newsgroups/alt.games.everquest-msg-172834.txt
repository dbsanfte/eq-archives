Mystic,
There was no folder named c:/program files/everquest.
The only folder found was c:/program files/sony/everquest.
Anyway, EQ Tech support wanted to take a look at these six files:
DxDiag.txt, MSinfo.txt (from DxDiag), MSinfo2.txt (from Win2k Administrative
Tools), DBG.txt, EQclient.ini, and EverQuestl.log (the last three are from
the Everquest folder).  Maybe they can figure out what the problem is.
Thanks for trying!
