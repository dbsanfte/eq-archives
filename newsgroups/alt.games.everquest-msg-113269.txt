  I'm not familiar with the trilogy pack, but I assume the cds are numbered
and that the installation procedure should be pretty foolproof.

  The only expansion not included in the trilogy pack that is currently out
is the Shadows of Luclin expansion, which you should buy if you think you're
going to be really getting into EQ... what it adds is well worth the money.

  As for your race/class pick, it might be a little tough because you're
playing an "evil" class to start, which means that travelling might be a bit
more difficult than usual.  You will be KOS (kill on sight) in many areas,
and not well liked in others, and knights don't get invisibility magic or
stealth abilities to help them with this problem until level 30.  Shadow
Knights aren't that difficult to learn and play, though knights are often
called on at higher levels to be a group's "puller" (the person who goes out
and finds a creature to fight, and brings it to the rest of the group),
which perhaps is not an ideal role for a new player... it requires a degree
of confidence and familiarity with whatever area you're hunting in, and a
willingness to die for your group if you accidentally pull more creatures
than you intended.

  As for tips on quick leveling, ect.  I would just get comfortable with the
game first.  The game is meant to be experienced and enjoyed, and it's
typically not best enjoyed if you're playing it as a race to level X.  Get
the feel of the game, try to figure things out for yourself, and then when
you have more specific ideas about what you want to get accomplished, then
solicit advice.

  Good luck and enjoy the game.
