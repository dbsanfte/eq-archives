So you never compared the buy/sell prices of Fine Steel weapons, or
most any other usable drop-only items, vs. those of gemstones for
instance?  They doubtless have a default behavior for most vendor
sold stuff like gems as well as some common dropped things like
batwings.  But other items, including spell scrolls btw, have mods
to their buy/sell prices that are item specific.  In fact, so many
items have goofy prices, and the goofiness appears to vary from
item to item, that buy/sell mods seem certain to be standard item
property in their database.
