Not bitter, just irritated at the stupidity of SOE tossing KEI onto
the already grotesquely overweighted side of the scale.

And just how many untwinked Warriors can afford to pay a Cleric with
BoA to buff them (assuming they can even find such an individual)?
And how many of those could make enough pp hunting solo to buy another
BoA when the first one wears off?  And how many of those also have the
pp to get an Embalmers Skinning Knife (or equiv.) so that they don't
run out of band-aids long before Aego runs out?

I've solo'd an untwinked Half-Elf Warrior to 32 without buffs, just
takes some hp gear, and an incredible amount of patience to put up
with not only the slow recovery between fights (10 seconds per
band-aid, + lag and user response delays, start next band-aid at
the wrong time and it is not only wasted but you have to wait the
ten seconds besides) but also the irritating runs back to town to
buy more band-aids (this was pre-Velious, no free ports and LOIO was
the best L20 - L30 soloing grounds for a Warrior I could find, too
much social and roamer agro in most of the old world for an unSoWed
Warrior to cope solo).  I never did find anyplace I could solo him
past 32.  Besides, by then I had been beating my head on the brick
wall for so long that it felt incredibly good to stop.  :-p
