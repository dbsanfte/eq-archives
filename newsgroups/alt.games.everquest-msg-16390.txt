	Start killing bears as soon as you possibly can, and keep
killing 'em until they turn green.

	HQ bear pelts go for between 25-35pp on my server.

	If you're an evil character, go to the Sisters of Erollisi
island in OOT.  They have Sisters there who are low- to mid-teens (I
soloed here easily with my 16th level SK).  Every time you kill one,
you get a Purity Belt.  Purity Belts can be sold to vendors for a
couple plat, and you can come back from the OOT with 30-40 of 'em
easily if you have the backpack space to carry 'em all.
