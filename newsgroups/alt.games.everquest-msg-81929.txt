Just curious to know what other chanters have in their 8 slots ?

Personally I usually have....(lvl 35 now)

1 Alacrity
2 Tepid Deeds
3 DD
4 Root
5 Tashania
6 Entrance (single mez)
7 Mesmerisation
8 Memblur

Depending on where I'm hunting, and group make up, I may swap out
mesemerisation or Root for  a Dot, sometimes clarity or RuneIII or  the
weaken line (although this line doesnt seem to be regarded, Im undecided)

If its an area where a lot of nasties are likely to show, I will often find
myself without any damage causing spells.

And do any of you have both colour flux and shift memmed, and if so why?

I'm suprised by ppl (any caster class) that have Gate memmed, never have the
room! perhas gate comes into it more at higher lvls?

Cheers

Kev
