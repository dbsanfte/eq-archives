Since when is a 3k heal weak? Take a normal exp group and you wont be 
seeing cleric heals landing for much more than that.. There's rarely any 
  need for cleric quality healing in exp grouping any more, why not take 
a druid as main healer instead of a cleric? They can actually make your 
group kill faster, which means more exp. Clerics can't do that.

Now what would you choose, someone who can heal good enough plus 
contribute to your exp or someone who can heal more than is needed but 
will suck up your exp? Earlier on we would get invited into tough groups 
because we were the only ones who could keep up with the healing needed 
while other classes could heal in easier situations (like most exp 
groups are anyway). In tougher situations get a cleric as your main 
healer or pull slower so that the second rate healer can keep up.

While I agree that it is a good thing that clerics arent the only ones 
able to heal in most situations (although I still think that for the 
very hardest places, only the best should do) clerics need some reason 
to be invited into groups so we can get some exp. I would even go so far 
as to say clerics should be more attractive in groups than a druid 
simply because druids have an alternative way of getting their exp 
(soloing) whereas clerics only have groups.

So, what ability have we lost? None. The problem is that another class 
has become a better choice than the cleric for the vast majority of exp 
groups.

Touchy subject .. :)
