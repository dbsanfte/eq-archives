I was gonna post this until I saw yours.  For those that dont know about it,
you can "rent" a mob/spawn for a 4 day period, assuming your guild is
"tiered" or strong enough to handle it so your not wasting anyone elses
time.

To me this takes out part of the fun of the game, but guess it should keep
people on Legends happy and IMO verant will do what ever it takes to keep
the $30/month rolling in.

I hope this feature doesn't make it to the regular servers.

(btw, I rented the AC from May 19,2002 to May 23,2002 so hands off! =P )
