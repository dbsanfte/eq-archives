    If you can consistently kill a black reaver with melee, I'd say you tank
just fine. I doubt you can, though.

    Yes, based on my experiences soloing a warrior and my observations of
what warriors in my guild do. I remember when my cleric was the same level
as my warrior, and there was no way in hell she could have kept all of dead
side zone-in clear. She had enough time to clear the undead half of the
entry area, and a little "breather room" - and that was it. The warrior was
killing twice as fast at the same level. So there's at least one class I'd
put below the warrior as far as soloing goes - the cleric.
