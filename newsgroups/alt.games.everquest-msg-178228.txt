That's the first thing that crossed my mind when I read this thread.
Like, "WTF?"

I've never fallen asleep playing. I've had to gate out of some raids
when it would have been very cool to stay, but I figure contributing
*nothing* by not being there is still less damaging then causing
problems if I fall asleep in a dangerous spot and my friends stick
around trying to "protect me".

If you fall asleep on a raid, you're just fucking everyone else over.
Either go to fucking bed or go mainline some Meth and wake the fuck up
already.
