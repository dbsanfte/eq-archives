One of my good ingame friends is a 60 mage. (Gives me all my focus
items, mod rods, etc. and I give him EoS that drop off chromo's since
he's doing smithing). He assures me that he still get's xp off almost
everything there and grinds his AA there whenever he's not raiding.
Would you rather stare at a spot on the ground or grind XP and/or AA xp
with your friends?
