Some newsreaders automatically trim off parts of a subject line before
a : in the "Re:" on their reply. This is designed to prevent subject
lines that read "Re: Re: Re:.....". Not the best newsreader design,
but not something he's intentionally doing either. Kinda boggles me
that people haven't figured out a different way to do such tags. Maybe
"EQ2 - <blah>" instead of "EQ2: <blah>"?
