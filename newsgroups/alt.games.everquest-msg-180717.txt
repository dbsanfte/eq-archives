    And you should be able to explore the NFQ pretty freely once you
complete the quest out in Nek. There's a dark elf out there that wants sonic
bat meats in exchange for faction with the trolls. Nice solution to the KOS
issue, especially since you can hose factions without even realizing what
you've hosed. People doing troll/ogre quests to get liked by one used to end
up disliked by the other, for example, and unless you knew what groups the
obscure faction names referred to (one won't be in game until this
expansion) you'd never know until they attacked you.

    Of course, no meats are as yet dropping from sonic bats so you'll have
to wait until that part is implemented!
