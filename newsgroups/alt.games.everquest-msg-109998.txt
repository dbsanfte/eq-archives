(top post fixed)  hehehe

I think the bad thing will be when the pork it up so much with
graphics and stuff that only people with high speed connections will
be able to play. I know that there are a lot of EQ players with cable
or dsl (both who for some reason seem to go LD far more often than I)
but a majority of the people out there are still on dial up. More so
for people in non-American countries. People often just say "Well why
dont you just get DSL then?"....as if it were readily available to
everyone on the planet.
