Depending on what class/level you are, you can hunt Hill Giants in Rathe
Mountains. Compared to other creatures of their level (around mid 30's) they
tend to drop a substationally larger amount of platinum. They also sometimes
carry fine steel weapons, that you can sell to venders in the same zone.

The downside to doing this is that very often, Hill Giants are hunted to
near extinction during peak hours. Also, I've been the victim of more kill
stealing in this zone in one night than I've seen in any other zone within a
few months time.

To answer the second part of your question, as far as I know, I've never
seen any quest made that gives you a large amount of money. There are some
quests that will give you an item that you can sell to other players for
some money.

everquest.allakhazam.com has a good list of quests. You can also sort
through the list by level, so you can find a quest that can be done at your
level.
