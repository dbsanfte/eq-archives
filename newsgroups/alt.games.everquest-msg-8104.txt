Since you are Iksar, it would require some effort, get a map first, make a 
couple of practice runs too.  If you have high level friends you can ask
them to buy it for you.

Sol A has 2 types of residents, goblins and gnomes, both could see past
invisibility, though with feign and luck you can do it.

5250 coins weigh about 130, not too big a deal, but you might want to get 
a SoW first, just be glad you don't play on a PvP server.

Oh I would take a bit more than 5250 with me, sometimes a vendor would just 
charge a little more for no apparent reason.
