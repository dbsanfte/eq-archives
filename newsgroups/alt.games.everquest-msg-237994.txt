"butting into their real life marriage"...not exactly.  I was BROUGHT into
it by her constant reminders of what she had going on at home.  She enjoyed
having me as a confidante of sorts it would seem.  I enjoyed playing the
game with her, we actually had fun together, but every once in awhile I'd
get hit with a shot of reality from her end..."Joe fell asleep drunk on his
drum set again".  "I'm gonna be celebrating New Year's home alone with my
cats and dogs."  Her comments were inserted to have me feel sympathy, to try
to comfort her, to reinforce to me that I was filling that hole in her life.
"There there, you deserve better than that!  You deserve a man who falls
asleep on your crotch!"  Now, there's nothing wrong with sharing your life,
but her comments were much too personal for someone who wanted to keep my
distance.  She was telling me about her prior cyber sex
partner/luver/whatever the hell it is 10 mins after I met her with NO
prompting from me, and I found out later that she was cybering him nearly 6
mos. after her honeymoon.  She wanted me involved in her marital problems,
to be a counselor, but she didn't want to be a friend at the same time.
Never would she ask about me, unless I TOLD her something about myself.  She
used the "I'm not nosey" excuse, and yet in the few groups we were in
together with other players, I would see her occasionally ask someone a
somewhat personal question in the group.  She wanted me to know her up and
down, to empathize with her problems, but she didn't want to listen in
return.  She realized I cared about people, about her problems, and she used
that to her advantage.

So, yes, I do call her manipulative.  I was using her as well, but yes, she
is manipulative.
