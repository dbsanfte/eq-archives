I'll say, although I'd rather get 100% than 75%, I won't be nearly
as fanatical about making sure I get that one point of damage if
its not a question of 100% versus 25%...

Have to go reread that patch message though, I wasn't running a
pet class (heh, well cleric is a pet class but the odds of my UHOF
doing 100% of the damage to even a cyan to me mob are passing
low) and just skimmed it.  Are you sure its not "pet takes 75%?"
