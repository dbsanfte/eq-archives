if u still havent got round to maxing your defence at lvl 49-some more soft
hitters are seafury cyclopses in ocean of tears.

im lvl 49 necro and my defence is a poor 136. the good thing is at lvl 49 we
get a powerful dot that heals caster (me) over time by about 500 hp. when
killling a sf i just pull to beach cast this spell (bond of death) and let
pet tank. as soon as i get full health i go into melee range and get whacked
for about 400 hps, then i back off and cast bod again, and take another 300
hps or so in whacks. all this time the sf is whacking u he isnt whacking pet
so pet doesnt need to be healed as much.

you get about one skill increase for every 3 mobs -so i will have maxxed
defence by the time sf s green out at 52-53 or so.

basically , this is the place to be if you are a necro with a poor defence
skill (as prolly the majority have)
