People are different, I know, but I just never understood the ire that
humans lack of night vision brings out in people.

Between simple things like lightstones, and the tons of equipment that
give off light, to various items that give infra/ultra-vision it seems
trivial to get around.

My human ranger did fine without night vision, and my human cleric
doesn't seem to be slowed down any.

But that's just me.
