I was fighting cragbeasts in natimbi when the 'fierce' appeared next to me.
It attacked and started wiping me out, so i started running to the magus,
when it summoned me. :P

It's a huge undercon compared to the other cragbeasts. Maybe it's a survivor
of the reset of that zone.

I noticed other people soloing there at 57 and don't know how they do it
unless this critter can be avoided. My gear is about half ornate and i had
virtue up and still died before I could really do anything about it. Anyone
know if the critter is confined to a small area for spawning or something? I
noticed the other cragbeasts don't seem to be social.
