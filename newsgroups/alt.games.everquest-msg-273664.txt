Its set in the city of athens, and has a mythical feel to it .
You can use your energy on a number of things. Train your stats, fight
monsters and other players in the gladiators pit, and work at the three
eagles inn for some extra gold. When you kill monsters, you get stuff called
"Burelia", which is used as sacrifices to the 4 gods
(Artemis,Posideon,Hades,Zeus) to gain blessings. Blessings are used to
enhance your armor and weapons. Each god gives you different blessings that
affect your equipment in different ways.
Plus there are many things to do that dont cost energy. You can modify
equipment, train and compete in events at the olympic stadium, go to work,
put a contract on someones head, join a clan, chat, use the forums and much
more.
