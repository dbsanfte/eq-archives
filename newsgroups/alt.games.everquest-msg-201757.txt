Well, my magician was still wearing raw silk and cloth at 50+.  It kinda
became the norm for him - he'd leveled so much in ultra ghey gear, why
bother to spend money now?

In those days I didn't really have much money, but I also didn't spend a
penny, for like, 2 years. Now I have more money than I can spend, so why
continue the struggle!

The best part of it all, though, is his best slots were all free (the PoE
stuff) - they came as a side bonus to my monks exping in PoE (well minus the
cost on gems for vials etc, but for the 5k it cost me, it probably has a
retail price of 150k+).

And his robe came from a tunare raid (by the time we started doing tunare,
we had full SS/Kael/NtoV), so it was 8 hours of twink farming before a date
with tunare

Spells don't really worry me just yet.  Im not the kind of person who has to
have a full spell book.

I did my mage the lazy way, for 30 levels, when you could buy 2 pets, and
research 2, I just made do with the 2 bought ones every time (until 49, when
I bought them all).

i still don't have muzzle, or even 3charge mods (got BO IV and other
droppables from 50-60 though, Im guild spell banker with 300+ kunark and
velious useless and rare spells).

I do have every single etheral spell though (about 4 copies of every
spell!), and a handful of specs, from friends PLing twinks in the right
zones.
