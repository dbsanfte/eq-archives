Yes they will transfer your character with all your equipment IF it stays on
the same server. The catch is you have to pay 50 dollars to do this. Unless
you have alot of no drop stuff it might be easier to restart your ranger. I
would bet that with a little help it wouldn't take you more than a week to
get to 25 again. Be sure to wait till lvl 6 to throw your equipment on your
new ranger though or you might lose your gear if you die.

BTW, I restarted my mage because I screwed up the first mages stats
terribly, I have never regretted restarting her. By changing races and
starting stats I gained 41 int points and it didn't take long to get to 22
again because I knew where to hunt, get spells etc.
