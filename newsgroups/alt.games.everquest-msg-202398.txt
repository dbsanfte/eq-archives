The keys have no relevance whatsoever to installing software to a machine.
Each account once created is divorced from the keys as well beyond ever
having to go back for password recovery and reclaming an account etc.

All you need is your station name and the associated password and you can
login from any machine with EQ on (obviously problems occur if you dont
have the relevant sofware patched in)

Rebuild the machine, install all the software, login with the relevant
station name, it will patch you up to the latest versions of everything
and in you go.
