I am an erudite wizard and noticed a lot of my recent spells seem to be 
for sale in neriak which alttough i havent tried am sure i will be kos 
if i go there.
What can i do to get in there and then be sold the spell by the vendor
I cant invis because as soon as i dal with the vendor the invis will 
wear off and i assume vendors kos just as guards do?
I was thinking either i need to make my faction change and become more 
evil but i was wondering if theres any other ways.
Ive been getting a necro friend to get me them but i dont like pestering 
them if theres a way to do this myself.
I heard something that if i can be changed into wolf form i become evil, 
is there any truth in this?
Does anyone have any ideas of how else i could get into neriak and other 
evil places safely?
