The upper end (upright, not the desktop) Intellistations were/are pretty
much made with high-quality, standard parts. I've had very good luck with
them at work, and done some upgrading (memory, video, disks) with non-IBM 
parts, without any trouble. (Not sure about the ones that use RDRAM, though
I have added IDE disk drives to them; they come with SCSI.)

It's a pain actually; they generally run well into late obsolescence; it's
hard to justify getting rid of working machines.
