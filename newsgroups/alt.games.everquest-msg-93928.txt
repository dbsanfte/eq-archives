I can't agree with you that it is cowardly to go anon.  It is a way to not
be bothered by as many people, it is something that makes a lot of sense to
do.  Someone who goes anon, recognizes there is a problem, recognizes there
is a solution, and uses that solution.  Certainly you will not be harmed by
the barrage of tells, but you will be annoyed by it, so why put up with it?
If you enjoy being annoyed, go for it, but to say someone is being a coward,
or performing a cowardly act if you prefer, for not wanting to be annoyed is
silly.

As to the distinction of being a coward vs performing a cowardly act.  I see
no need to debate the finer points of this, it is not really relevant to the
issue.
