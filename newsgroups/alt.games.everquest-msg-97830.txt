On this issue, yes. You are, that's for sure.

Yes, simple things like being able to watch the screen change, instead of
blandly looking at the same boring spellbook page for 90% of my playtime.
After 35, I could actually monitor the progress of a battle...like notice
when an add came instead of finding out when it started beating me like a
rag doll because I was sitting.

Getting equipment is nice...not having the spellbook up when I meditated
fundamentally altered (considerably for the better) the way I play the
game. I don't know how the people who had to put up with the spellbook
THEIR WHOLE GAME CAREER did it, before the book-goes-away-at-35 rule was
put into effect.
