Well, I think this matter was covered quite clearly in the classic textbook
"The Neurophysiological Effects of Spell-Casting".  Unfortunately, I do not
remember the author, but I do believe he was from Discworld.

In a nutshell, he argued that we should feel happy that we can cast spells
at all while moving about what with the distortions such practice has
effected on certain brain structures at a neuronal level.  Specifically, the
reticular activating system.  And as we know, that structure is intimately
related to balance and motion sickness.  Thus, the reason that spell-casters
cannot cast spells on a boat is that we are all too motion-sick!

Now, if we could only discover the components to create a potion
corresponding to this world's Dramamine...

Or, as Dan Day pointed out:

"....So that some numbnuts doesn't cast a spell on <insert big
mob here> as the boat passes the creature's island, only to
have the creature swim up to the boat, slay the spellcaster,
and then everyone else on board who has nowhere else to
escape to."
