Possible "good" reason:  One of the few zones in the game that supports
(relatively) easy soloing for a Warrior in the 20 - 30 level range (can
actually get to 32 before the dark blues are too rare to keep you busy).

If you go there, save those Green Goblin Skins.  Depending on server
you can get as much as 250pp each for them in bazaar.
