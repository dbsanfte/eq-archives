AFAIK, there are only two places to find it (unless Luclin or PoP snuck it
in somewhere), Dalnir and Seb.  I'm not even sure about Seb.  What I am
fairly sure of is that it's not easy to farm in large quantities, but
since Dalnir is the lowest level place to have it, I'd suggest
there.  

Of course, in Seb you could probably find a group and get XP, so that has
advantages. :)  Assuming I'm right about Seb.  Damn it's annoying being
away from EQ for 6 months at times...memory gets a little fuggy.
