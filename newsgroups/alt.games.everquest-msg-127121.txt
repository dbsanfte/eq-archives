Subject: Shaman and making Sow Potions

My shaman just hit the level to make potions.  She makes about 10 sow potions
per stack of ingrediants (more than 10PP per potion, even with a high charm
bard buying the ingrediants.)  I haven't gotten any Skill Up messages in about
200 attempts.  Is this normal?  (I did way better with my ranger and arrow
making...)  Any idea why?  
Isn't there a talisman or something you can buy now that ups your odds 1% or
something?
