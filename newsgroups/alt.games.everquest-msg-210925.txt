actually had that happen in PoJ the other night - guy pulled a few mobs, 
which we had been handeling well all evening, and suddenly i'm unable to 
cast any heals.  had to tell the group to book out, so i was unable to 
tell if it was a zone-wide problem or limited before zoning

craziest thing i ever saw.
