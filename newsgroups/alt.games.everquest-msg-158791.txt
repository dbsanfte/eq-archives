No, but thanks for playing.  Don Pardo will now tell you about
your lovely parting gifts.

Did you have an actual disagreement with my critique of the spammer's
screed, Rastus, or were you merely indulging in a bit of free-form
"I'm so above this" cynicism?

"All", eh?  Speaking of "knee-jerk radicalism", Rastus...

Quite true.  But from your post I get the impression that you're of
the opinion that "all" people are this mindless.  Except yourself,
of course..

I try as much as possible to find unbiased information, which is why
I've given up on ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN (after decades of comparing
their output to the results of my own research).  As the old saying
goes, "the media appears competent and unbiased, until you get a chance
to watch them cover a topic you actually know well."

The best sources of information today are internet sites that provide
pointers to current news stories from all sources, then provide a lively
forum for discussion of same.  Sure, a lot of crap gets thrown around,
but in the adversarial discussions that ensue, the truth tends emerge
(as well as analysis that's inevitably more astute than you'll find
from, for example, Dan Rather or the editorialists at the New York
Times. *cough*).

Unlike the "sit in your chair and we'll tell you what to think" media,
(http://home.houston.rr.com/danday/pictures/mediaspin.jpg)
the online current events discussion forums give you pointers to
where you can go research the topic in greater depth yourself, 
if you're in the mood to double-check something (or reanalyze it), 
as well as a way to bounce your own views off people and quickly 
learn which can be shot full of holes and which can't.
