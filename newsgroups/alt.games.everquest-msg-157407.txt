It's amazing what a snare+dot spell can do for getting and holding
aggro.  

Made a SK twink a week or so ago.  He's 17 and I'm having a pretty
damned good time.  I just wish somebody had told me that the Mace of
the Shadowed Soul was so incredibly awesome and so insanely cheap
before I got to 16 without working any 1hblunt.

19/29 and 10int for 100pp?!?!  The things must drop like candy in CoM.
