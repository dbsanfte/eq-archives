Was thinking about this some more last night...  Ideally you all want
to start somewhere similar as well.  Form a Barbarian quartet.  I've
always liked the EF newbie areas, and Halas is an easy town to learn
your way around. 
Maybe a Shaman, Rogue/warrior and a pair of Beastlords.  =)  You'd
pretty much be unstoppable...

Or 3 Beastlords and a Shaman.  That's SIX+ damage dealers in the
group.  Sure, you don't have big heals, but with all that melee, you
may not need it.  And Shaman's get SoW early in the game.

I know I have a lot of fun when my BL groups with 1 or 2 other BLs.
Pure carnage.
