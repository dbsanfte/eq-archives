Congratulations! More fuel for the "EQ is actually good for you" 
arguments =). I'm slightly arachnophobic (*and* arachnophilic, go 
figure... I guess we are fascinated by that which we fear) in real life, 
but this has never reflected in the game.

I came across a Wizard in Fennin Ro who was quite allright with the 
normal spiders in the game, but was terrified to death by Drachnids. In 
fact, they look so realistic to her from a distance she had never come 
close enough to realize they have human torsos.
