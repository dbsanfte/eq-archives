After playing with a bow for pulling (from advice from this group, thanks
guys!) I have one comment. Wouldn't it be nice if bows or arrows could do
some real damage? Wouldn't it be nice if in EQ, bows could REALLY dole out
some damage other than a *Thwack* Hello. Think of the possiblities.
From playing another game, which shall remain nameless, but there was a
common nickname for a character that went with only a bow, "Bowazon". You
could have bows that could do frost damage or lightning damage or poison
damage. You could take this another step with arrows as well that had
serrated edges that would do a DoT type affect and slowly bleed the mob to
death.
I don't know if this kind of ability exists in EQ now and I just haven't
seen it, but most people I see with bows just use them for pulling instead
of really dishing out damage.

Think of it, a whole company of archers with nuke bows going into
Kithicor....
