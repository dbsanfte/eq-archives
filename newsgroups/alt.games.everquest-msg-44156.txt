A Trollie friend of mine ignored my istructions upon entering Paineel 
about being very careful _not_ to fall in the hole.  "Uhh, oops, my finger 
slipped..." quoth he.  Much experimenting commenced.  I created a new alt 
so we could play with the quitting-while-falling strategy for getting in 
there.  You should issue the /quit command approximately 4.5-5 seconds 
after you zone to take the least damage.

He was only level 30, though, so he still got hammered before he could 
loot his corpse.  A friendly Bristlebaignian rogue was located, who 
dragged our corpse to the entry hall.  "Ah, no problem," we thought. "Now 
we can just use shrink!" Hmm.  You can only cast shrink in a dungeon.  We 
went into warrens and cast it, but it dropped when we zoned.  So shrink 
ain't gonna work here, unless potions are different somehow...

So my alt went to get the key.  Over 100pp, ouch, and no drop... But she's 
been to the hole at level 2 and lived. :)  The door really doesn't stay 
open very long.

And an Erudite was too big to squeeze in... exactly how small do you have 
to be?
