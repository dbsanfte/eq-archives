We had that happen to our Troll Warrior once.  Got stuck in the water pipe.  
I was just casting lev on him when he swam down and fell.  That was fun.  
Not.

Ended up being a total wipe since we had just pulled a Liz from a lower 
level about 2 seconds before he fell in.  The lizard showed up with 3 
friends and it went downhill from there.

It's much easier if you get there and the Avatar isn't up already =)  Keep 
the room clean and pull him alone when he pops.  Grab some of the lizard-
blood potions from the Cenobytes.  I got one for my warrior the last time 
there, and won't leave home without it.  Not just for escapes, though, as I 
like to travel and way need a quick "port" to cazic.  We port into there a 
lot when we want to be in that area.

I killed one outside of the Archon pyramid yesterday.  That's where I have 
seen other SKs looking for them, too.  Dropped the arms.

Just stay near the zoneline and pull to there, and heed the "TRAIN!!" 
shouts.  Then slowly move in as you get more comfortable. Again, "Train to 
Zone!" is usually a good sign to get off the tracks in there.  My 
Enchanter's old group took the Ass / Sup room over around level 33-34.  The 
Wizards down below were a bitch, I recall.

Someone else said this guy ( Evil Eye )is an Enchanter.  He's not, he's a 
Wizard.  Bash, slam, and stun him and he goes down fast.  Drops the bag 
every time now, from what I have seen.  We stayed in Dalnirs until we were 
about 35-36, then on to Kaesora.  Left Kaesora at 40 (?).  Will be leaving 
CoM at 45, I think.  Then, on to LGuk for an FBSS...

I really enjoyed going to Dalnirs ( decent PP for buying your loots, rare 
decent drop ) and then to Kaesora ( decent drops, good plat ), and now to 
City of Mist ( nice drops, decent PP again ).  The best part about these 3 
places, at least on my server, is that the idiot players don't last there.  
You get to know who they are and noone lets them in a group twice.  This 
usually makes for good grouping.  In Dalnirs, we solidified our party of 6, 
and now we are a killing machine that will be traveling together for a long 
time.

Ow.  In Kaesora, and now CoM, I prefer our Bard over having an enchanter, 
but one is pretty much required to to do them right and semi-safely. We did 
a lot in Dalnirs without either, but not further than the 1st level.  If 
you ever want to hit level 3 for the hell of it and wipe out the whole 
dungeon, you need CC.  It's always nice to say you took out a whole dungeon 
before you move on, especially if you are level-appropriate for it.
