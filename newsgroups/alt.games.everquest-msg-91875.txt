I would say the chief problem with the "end game" in EQ
isn't the risk versus reward on any particular mobs, it more
has to do with Verant's notion of "progression." If you
haven't noticed, Verant loves the idea of a progressions,
meaning: you have to do A to do B, then you have to do B to
do C, then C to do D, etc.

Even low level dungeons have progressions where you must
work your way to the mob that drops the good thing by
carefully killing lots of mobs in the rooms before it.

End game zones like Veeshan's Peak and Temple of Veeshan are
similar on a more difficult scale. The problem with this is
that once one guild gets good at and begins a progression
(like ToV North, for example), it becomes very hard for
another guild to ever get any of those dragons because the
first guild knows it better and gets there first. Also,
since the respawn times on many uber mobs are the same, the
guild that last killed a progression always has the best
idea about when it will respawn, thus insuring that they
will continue to get that progression. This leads to the
uber guild phenomenon where one guild gets most of the good
mobs on a server over and over.

Fortunately, the recent "randomness factor" that was added
to many Velious uber mobs helps this somewhat.
