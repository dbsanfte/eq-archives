Obviosly that's just 'one persons opinion'. I know a number of people 
who acquire friends much easier than computers, and still more who play 
eq fanatically but don't care much about the social aspects. They 
interact sure, but they aren't looking to expand their social circle.

Again, just your opinion.

Lose a war with a single half decent untwinked 20th level bard?

Whatever floats your boat :) Obviously we disagree; that doesn't make 
you wrong but it doesn't make me wrong either.

So all these people posting here, looking for places to solo at 34, 41, 
56, 64 etc etc etc... they're what? Playing the game "wrong"?  Perhaps 
Verant (at the beginning) should have made it impossible to leave town 
without a full group?

I'm of the opinion that the purpose of the game is overcome its 
challenges. There are a variety of challenges, and a significant part of 
it requires grouping and organization to overcome, but I don't see that 
making friends is the point.

Hell most raid guilds treat you more like an employee than a friend, 
giving you a schedule, jobs to do, and pay you in rp, (which you can use 
to buy gear). Real 'friendly sounding'... and these are the most 
'organized' and 'uber' people in the game.

If friends were the point then there is no need for gear or character 
advancement. Yet 5+ expansions brought us gear, more gear, and still 
more gear, not to mention more levels, aa abilities and dozens of new 
zones to defeat to attain them. I am unconvinced that the object of the 
game is anything but character advancement.

Its an mmrpg. Rpg's have always been about character advancement... the 
mm just means you get to (even have to) interact with lots of other real 
people along the way, as part of the fun. You don't have to become 
buddies with everybody (unless you want to), you can play an mmrpg and 
interact with people without 'making making a lot of friends'.

Not as much? Sure I agree with that. Never said otherwise. But buying 
legitimately acquired plat amounts to actively looking for ways *not* to 
play the game to advance your character... if you dislike EQ enough to 
look for ways to avoid actually playing it you probably shouldn't be 
playing at all. (And ought save your money for a game that you actually 
want to play...)
