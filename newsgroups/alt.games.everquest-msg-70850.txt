If you're talking about the handwraps/claws stuff, then yes I've heard it
doesn't become trivial til the high 90s.  Even so, the drops for required
items is ridiculous.  I'm level 13 and I still haven't found simple level 4
drops to do the newbie quest.

For the reward you get, these quests are questionable; considering you can
get far better weapons off low level mobs.

Personally I'd like to take the quest guys from Verant out in the back and
beat some sense into them.  But for now my way of venting frustration is
just to /feedback and not do the quests.
