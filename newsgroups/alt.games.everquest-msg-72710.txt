Good for you!  Too many dont do this.  Yes, casters can use them, but
casters can also hollar out that they need them so that others dont
destroy them.=)

Zytl, Dorn, Gix are all major undercons.  As a warrior I wasnt able to
start killing Gix with any degree of success until I was in my late
20's.  Dorn was still giving me a run for it when he was green into
the mid 20's.

And yes, he does have some nasty spells, primarily that death touch of
his....
