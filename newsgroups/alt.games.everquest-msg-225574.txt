Yard trash in Storms is quite a bit different from the level ~62 mobs in
Valor.   Very few hunt it, and no pickup groups.   Perhaps there are rare
exceptions, but in the vast majority of cases that 55 shouting for a group
is dreaming of an all 62 -65 group killing golems / giants that adds them
for the hell of it.

*shrug*   Perhaps.  I'm not really up on the specifics of mage combat, and
what they can do at each level.   But I'm willing to bet thier dps is pretty
bad, and significantly lower than if they waited in an appropriate location
until the mobs became yellow to them, rather than deep deep red.
