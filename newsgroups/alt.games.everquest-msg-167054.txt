To "Play"?

Wizard

To play to it's fullest?

Bard

Now, my main's a bard, so I'll give that disclaimer. I have something like 9
alts (1 or 2 on my daughter's acount) of various classes.

The bard is a ton of work, but the issue is really more than that. Since a
bard can do virtually everything, I'm finding that it's a fairly rare bard
that knows the "right" thing to do is. I have a serious question mark for
any bard that can just recite his song lineup as a matter of conversation.
My response would be something like "you mean *right now* - right?" Every
situation is different, and that means that bards need to be the master of
adaptation. Group member leaves? OK, so replaced them (If anyone)? What do
they bring to the group? How do I need to change what I'm doing because of
them? A bard's role is really never set with the exception of certain raid
situations (does anyone NOT know what a bard's going to be doing on a Naggy
or Vox raid for goodness sake?). OK, so your role is changing as the group
changes, but it also changes as the fight changes. I'm dotting, no, wait,
I'm mezzing, no, I'm doing both, hey, there's a runner, better snare him,
but wait, that means I don't have enough twist room for that haste buff -
what to do?

Tough, very tough.

Now, that said, the hardest time I've ever had with a toon was a BL I
created. Had a heck of a time even getting level 2 with her. 3 was
nightmarish. I should have stuck around for 4 (at which point things would
have gotten lots better), but I just couldn't stand it anymore.....

BTW: I would toss in that I think that a Mage is a often poorly played
(still not sure hard to play though) one also. Far, far too many mages seem
to think that all a mage is is target mob and cllick pet attack. There's
really so much more.
