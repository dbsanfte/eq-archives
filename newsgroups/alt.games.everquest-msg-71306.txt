Well I think it's possible they are limited by the technology they
invented 3 years or more ago. Remeber the zone files live on your PC
and are fixed so the graphics engine is limited to using the data 
that's in the zone files. Maybe adding some new data structures
would speed up rendering but that's just not going to happen. The
patches are big enough without downloading new zone files.
