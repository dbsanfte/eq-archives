    I don't have much experience with CH yet.  Lenny just didn't have enough
Hitpoints to make it all that useful.  He is now, however, approaching the point
where I will have to get used to it.  I know that it is one of the biggest
defining spells of my class, however.  Right now, though, it is the one that
makes me the most nervous.  This passes, right?

   I have mount too.  Her name is Gumdrop, (she's green!) and you're right, she
does make it easier to swap spells outside.  Not much use in dungeons, of
course, but some use is better than none.  I understand that I might be spending
more time in the planes as I get older.

   Well, to be honest, I don't usually do all four of these things all of the
time.  Pulling and CC is what I am mostly used to when grouped.  Nuking only in
emergencies, and stunning if I happen to get bored.  But mainly, I sit and med,
and then heal.

    Actually, I would estimate that almost 75% of my experiencing has been in a
group of 2, me and Lenny.  And the vast majority of that with Lenny 1.0, without
a single spell to his name.  I'm glad that you have confidence in my future
abilities.  Let's hope that the future bears that out.

   Well, since I read Lance's essay about just using the level 5 stun (thanks
Lance!) I'll just be keeping that one loaded.  And I'm looking into Thomas's
advice about getting a Donal's bracer, as well.  But things are bit weird on FV
as far as prices go.  I bought a set of Donal's arms for around, well, I don't
remember, but it had to be under 2k or I would have remembered it.  Yesterday I
looked for any Donals stuff in the bazaar, and found two sellers for the
arms...at over 117k each.  Ya, right.  Good luck with that.  Oh, and no bracers
to be had at all.  I wonder if Lenny and I could duo in Old Seb.  If now, I
wonder if I can talk Splendid into coming along and baby-sitting us.
 
> One cleric should be all the healing a group ever needs.

    Well, with only one healer, I guess there is more of a chance of a wipe
should there be an overpull.  But jeez, EQ is at least a little bit about living
on the edge, isn't it?

    Even if I was doubting my ability to keep up with a specific group, I would
never ever blurt that out at the start of an adventure.  It seems like a great
way to get a group from thinking "Great, we got a cleric, this is going to be
fun" to thinking "Uh-oh..."
