I did this quest as a level 8 DE enchanter.  It's fairly simple.

The first time I ran it I cast alliance on Clurg and turned in the
book.  Sadly, I did not get the stein, but I did get the positive
faction hit.  The next time I ran it I was indifferent after casting
alliance and he gave me the stein.  Incidentally, completing
the stein quest gives a MAJOR faction increase with Clurg.
Everytime I completed it I bumped up one level until I didn't
need to cast alliance on him.  I am his ally after 6 or 7 runs
of the quest.  I worked this route for a while on Prexus and
financed my lower level spells when I had time.

Hope that lends some guidance,

Jarlaxyl the Obscure
