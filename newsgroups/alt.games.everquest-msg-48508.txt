I've heard that said before by lots of folks. And there are certainly
enough 50 to 60 warriors in the groups I play with who aren't even
bothering to try for theirs. However, I am. Two reasons.

First, it's an epic quest. Yes, it's going to be a humungeous PITA, but
if I manage to finish it, and have my light sabres to carry around, I'll
be proud of them and it will remind me that I stuck it out and did it.

Second, you (along with many others) keep mentioning how many vellious
weapons put the jagged blade of war "to shame". Obviously you are
correct, but where do you get these weapons? From what I've read, you'd
better be raiding Sleepers or ToV to get your hands on them. I'm still
not in an uberguild, and until I am my chances of ever getting into
those zones and getting a shot at those weapons will remain pretty slim.
The Epic may be the best I'll have access to for a long time to come.
