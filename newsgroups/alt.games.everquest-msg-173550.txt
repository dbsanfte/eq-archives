This Bazaar you guys are talking about, where about is it actually ?

So would you just go to the bazaar and start shouting "spiderling
silks for sale, 3pp each" ?

I've found it's not too hard to get spiderling silks down in the
sewers of qeynos, there's usually two of them down there and with
tracking not too hard to find.

Also another poster once said something about robo traders ? How do
you set yourself up to become a robo trader ?
