Heh, Sont doesn't live long on Lanys -
Auxillium, Inevitable Storm and a couple of
other guilds are keying for ST at the moment.
In Aux, we have just over 20 keyed folks right
now (also causing some debate.  My ranger friend's
2 boxed cleric got a key before some of the mains,
but he's ALWAYS there)

I think Kael is definitely a good place to start.
With a rogue you can do CoM.
The Hole is a good place to practice raiding.
