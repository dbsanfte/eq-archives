Ahhhh, now that makes sense.  I tried lots of different things to get
the Shaks to pop.  I was fairly succesful but I was just slaughtering
2 caves of them, hoping that the next pops would be the black ones.  I
tried killing the warlord first, and last.  I tried killing all but
the Shak Dratha Warlord, leaving him up to call his friends back (lame
I know).  I tried leaving every other one alive.  Nothing seemed to
work.  I bet the time of day is the key...which is a bitch since you
can't tell what time it is on Luclin.

BTW, even on very light greenies, don't try to fight completely drunk.
 I damn near died there once because I decided to buy some ale from
one of the merchants and drink with him before I killed him.  Worked
fine until I attacked the warlord.  I couldn't outrun him.  I couldn't
channel a heal or snare.  I couldn't attack him for the life of me.  A
40 or so druid saved my ass, which was quite embarassing.
