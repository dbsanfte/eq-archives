Best thing to do if you are inexperienced in a group is LISTEN.

All but the most obnoxious groups will not have a problem with you
being new to grouping.  They'll generally try to be very helpful.

You are going to make what they perceive as mistakes and they'll tell
you so.  It will be hard at first to judge whether what you are doing
is wrong or whether  it just doesn't fit with their particular play
style.

Take an example:  We've had new people crowding the person calming
mobs.  This often results in mobs getting pulled too early when they
are not all calmed.  If  you listen and stop doing that then fine.  If
you do it on every pull after being asked many times and eventually
cause a serious overpull that wipes the group ... well lets just say
that ain't the way to make friends.
