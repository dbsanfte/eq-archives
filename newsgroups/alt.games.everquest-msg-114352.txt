The thing is that most of the players who are effected by Verant's
current patching schedule (Like myself, I work 3pm to 11pm.  I am up
till about 6am before I got to bed, then start my day again at about
1pm.), I really don't care all that much.  Hell, gives me time to
catch up on all the TV that I have TiVo'ed.
