Sorry, I must have missed it. Where did anyone say a "significant chunk
of their self esteem"? You don't have to take anything very seriously to 
derive some satisfaction and maybe even bolster your self-esteem a little

basketball or simply hit the wastebasket across the room with a crumpled up 
piece of paper.
