>My level 30 warrior in crafted/banded with no haste item still solos, 
>unbuffed.

A guy in my guild only solos his character and his warrior is now over 50.  
100% solo except for 2 minor raids that I'm sure he got no more than 2 
ticks of EXP for.

His warrior ( and other charactes ) are relatively poor and untwinked.

The reason Celaeno doesn't address Randy's "point" that non-casters can't 
solo after the mid-levels is because it's not a point - it's a fallacy.
