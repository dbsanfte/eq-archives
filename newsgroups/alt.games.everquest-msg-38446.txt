Not yet. You'll get bind later on. (I think level 12 or 14 or so.) You
don't need to change your bind point for a while, though. You need to
stay there in the newbie area outside of town, near the guards, and kill
things that are blue to you until they all start to green out. Then you
can worry about moving on.

Here is an *excellent* resource that you should bookmark immediately.
The menu on the left has tons of stuff, including "Quests by Zone". You
can go there and see a list of all the quest available in any given zone
where you might find yourself. Also *TONS* of other good information
there on all the zones, classes, equipment, etc.
