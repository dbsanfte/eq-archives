Do warriors get double attack as well as dual-wield?  I pulled out my 24
ranger this weekend for a little down time.  With double attack, dual wield,
and kick, I can attack five times a round when everything fires.  The poor
26 paladin we had as MA was really having to work to keep aggro; I ended up
stopping kicking and switching to lighter-hitting weapons - and this guys'
weapons are crap, lammy and a green jade broadsword.  (Piercing skill needs
help anyway. )  At higher levels, with double attack and dual wield maxed,
it's gotta be ill.
