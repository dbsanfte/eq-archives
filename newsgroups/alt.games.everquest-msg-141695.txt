So this is supposed to explain the Clerics of Tunare sending their
young paladins off on quests that require them to slaughter Faeries?
That's very nearly as lame as asking me to believe that clerics and
paladins devoted to Erolisi Marr (goddess of love) have more in
common with necromancers and shadowknights devoted to Innoruuk
(god of hate) than they do with a fellow paladin devoted to E. Marr
(from the same home temple even), just because the latter is a
half-elf and the former are all humans (i.e. the cultural smithing
restrictions).
While it is possible to roleplay in EQ, and many do so enthusiasticly,
the gaping holes and absurdities riddling the backstory stretch it
well beyond my ability to suspend disbelief.  That, combined with some
of the more arbitrary restrictions and absurd quests, hinders RP more
than the good bits help it.
It's still a great game though, and there's nothing to stop you
from inventing your own bits of backstory to support your RP.
