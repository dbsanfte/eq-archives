Did you guys just miss the obvious qualitative difference between IGE and
SOE doing this?

Yes, they both would have a real economic incentive to keep you from getting
the items or cash yourself ingame, but IGE has far, far fewer and much less
effective methods of doing so, SOE isn't burdened by those restrictions.

And that's what puts me off on this issue a lot more than people's farming
habits.
