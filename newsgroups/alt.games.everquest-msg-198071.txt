Really? I spent a lot of time (both my characters are barbarians) in the
Everfrost area and never came across them before. I had to buy my shield
(which was either the same kind they drop or close to it). The daggers I've
never seen before, anywhere. I used to get tons of rusty daggers off the
decaying skeletons though.

I played regularly in this zone just a month or two ago. Lots of new things
dropping. My friend noticed the same thing in Greater Faydark.
