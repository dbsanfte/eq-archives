Will, I suppose if I took you seriously when you start by saying
"nor its really so much "RP"" and then go on at great length about
RP rationales, I might be confused.  But maybe that's just me.

At L30 they can start getting the same gear as me.
FWIW, my current main is 50, playing on Stromm server where I started
him the day the server opened.  Some of my gear is purchased in Bazaar,
some of it is looted from mobs I killed or helped to kill, all of it
is level appropriate in that sense (not that I would refuse to buy
better stuff, but better either isn't for sale or is priced insanely,
I see more outright greed in the Stromm bazaar than I've ever seen in
EQ on any other server I've played on).

You appear to be unaware of just how much good gear is accessible to
you in the mid-game.  Here's a hint tho, if you insist on looting
everything yourself you're gonna be pharming greens before you're
done, there ain't no rule requiring mobs to drop the item you're
after instead of something else.  That little fact is what makes the
Bazaar so useful, btw, it really was pretty awful for most of us
when you had to endure the lag and spam of the crowds in GFay or EC
(depending on server) in order to buy/sell gear.  For every person
who waxes nostalgic over the "old days" there're many more who are
far happier with the Bazaar.

Well, there's no shortage of jerks in-game, that's for sure.  Not
everybody is considerate enough to find some out-of-game forum to
vent their unpleasantness to.  ;)  And, of course, some folks just
do the jerk thing 24x7.
