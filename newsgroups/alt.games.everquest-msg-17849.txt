I noticed no change last night while fighting gargoyles (level 18-19). I'm a
level 22 mage and was partnered with a 25 shadownight and then later with a
21 paladin. In both cases the gargs stopped beating on my pet which had to
be the lowest level among us and started beating on the tank and then back
to the pet again. In other words, the mob aggroed between its available
targets without regard to level but with regard to its hate list as normal.
This is from a total of 20 garg battles.
I didn't pay much attention to the much lower level greater skeleton
placeholders/yardtrash (level 14-15 maybe) but I did not notice them
exclusively attacking the pet either.

Just one more clue to add to the puzzle of the intentionally vague patch
message.
