Wow, that would be just wonderful..  less cramped space, easier to arrange
groups of spells without having to spread a group over several pages.
And if we coul have "auto-meming" would be a grand bonus indeed..  Just
wonder what happends when you are halfway through memming up your
favoritespellbatch_01 and bastagemob_002 decides to bonk you on your head.
Will you have to restart the hole process from spell 1 again or will there
be a resume, say you managed to mem 4 spells before being jumped and you
sit down and it restarts with no 5?  I guess we'll find out soon enough,
like before X-mas (of what year nobody knows).
