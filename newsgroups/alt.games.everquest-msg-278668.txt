I was not arguing that any other spell is the defining spell, however I 
would argue about calling the other differences minor.  They were large 
enough such that at the 2 or 3 levels immediately prior to me recieving 
my new heal spells, I could not keep up with being the main healer in a 
group hunting in a level appropriate area, whereas a cleric could 
trivially do so.  This was particularly noticable in the high 20s and 
high 30s.

CHeal is actually not really all that useful at level 39, it does not 
become useful until the cleric is grouping with other characters that 
have enough HP to make CHeal actually efficient to use.

What's the level 39 CHeal cap now?

Going strictly by heal spells, yes, that is correct, if you also take 
into account that as a shaman I can reduce the attack speed of mobs by up 
to 70%, probably not.  If a mob is only inflicting about 30% of the 
damage it would otherwise inflict, I don't need a heal anywhere near as 
large as a cleric does to heal the damage inflicted.
