I think your analogy of the used car and gas is faulty . What is being
done with the "pay more get 4 more character slots" or most of the
rhetorical examples you put forward is more analogous to buying a car
and dickering over the options. The base model will run just fine, but
having things like air conditioning, power steering, CD/AM/FM radio and
stereo speakers, and the High Performance package, etc. make the car
more enjoyable.

If you don't like the options and consider the base model to be
undesirable because of the lack of those options you don't want to pay
for, then you don't buy the car (or game).

Analogies are often imperfect and the car purchase one is definitely
imperfect.
