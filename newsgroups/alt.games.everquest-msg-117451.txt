An AA level is equivalent to level 51.

I've never actually had my AA toggle at 50:50 - I was level 60 (and maxed
exp) long before Luclin came out, so when I bought it I simply went 100% aa.

When my exp loss started getting too high (I was down to 2 yellows in 60) I
switched to 100% regular exp for a few hours, and then continued with my alt
levels.

Now I just do that when I need to keep 60 safe (im 4 blue from max exp, so
good for a while again)

Im not imagining things, honest.  ack, who said that?!?!
