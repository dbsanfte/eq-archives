Ranger/Shaman looks pretty good to me (best slows in the game are
absolutely golden in the view of a tanking Ranger).

Warrior/Shaman also works well.  And Paladin/Druid is surprisingly
effective (DoT stacking makes it work).  And, if you're feeling a
bit twisted, Paladin/Necro is quite passable in most circumstances
and flat-out devastating vs. undead.  Finally, one combo I've not
seen listed by anybody, just as twisted as the PAL/NEC, would be
Beastlord/Necro, not sure how easy it would be to bot it, but it
sure looks deadly to me.
