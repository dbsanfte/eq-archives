I died as a newbie Iskaar monk (not that I'm particularly seasoned
now...) and lost my starting bracer.  I spoke to a monk NPC in my
guild and told her that I did not have my bracer.  She then gave me
a book and instructed me to see the Toil Master.

I did that, asked for my hammer and bag, then went to see the
mortician to get my mortar and pestle.  Then I spent the next
two hours or so whacking MOBs with a tremendously slow hammer
to get all the bone fragments I needed.

I combined the items in the bag and handed it back to my guild
member.  She took it and said nothing.  At this point I promptly
tore all remaining hairs from my head.


So... was I supposed to give the combined bag to the toil master?
Rather than the representative of my guild? (like the book said)

Considering I'm doing it all again I'd like to get it right this time.
Oh well.. at least I now have 10 in 2 HB... compared to the zero
I started with... by the end of this pennance I should be up to
about 15 at least...


Cheers,


Dave
