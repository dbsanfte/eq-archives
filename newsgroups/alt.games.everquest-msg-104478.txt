Ok, i guess that i am just not convinced that it would work in this type of
game.  How would you do it?  What I am really looking for is the purpose of
first person's perspective to a game where you aren't going in to a dungeon
to get experience as much as you are trying to get from point a to point b,
and hundreds of monsters stand in your way.  I am just taking one side of
this (i recognize there are other sides) but when is the last time you went
from freeport to qeynos hacking away at everything that moved?  The monsters
in this game don't leave you alone unless they don't see you :>)

Ok the look it up comment was a bit much.  "I" think of dungeon crawls as
hacking through monsters to get some quest or item or to get to a new
section of the world you have never seen.  In everquest i don't really see
this.  I see dungeons as: load into a zone, find a spot to pull to, kill
monsters (hey look uberitema dropped give to "player_character"), ok trouble
is here time to evac, rinse/repeat.  I LIKE everquest but you can't compare
it with Dungeon Siege, not because one is better then the other but because
they really are different types of games.

True, it isn't a true first person view, but it's so dang close you can see
the details on the monsters you are fighting and it's close enough that you
can see only what the person you have selected can see...(was that the
purpose of First person?)
