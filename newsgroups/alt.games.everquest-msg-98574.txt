> 4 SK ( best  MA's  can  pull  in  a  pinch  .)
> 5  monk ( if  you  can't  find an  sk to  pull)

Why do you think that?

The topic specifically says "high level raiding"... and SK's have *nothing*
which can come close to a warriors defensive disc (think mobs on a par with
Tormax, Statue, Vindi, AoW, Dain, nTov, Rumblecrush)

An SK means double the mana needed for heals, a much faster cheal rotation,
much more cleric ago, and still a dead SK probably

Also, interested to hear why you think SK's make far superious pullers to
monks?  I've played both a fair bit, and I don't think SK's FD spell is even
on the same level as monks FD.   Granted my SK didn't have deathpeace, but
even with that I see a massive massive difference between the 2 FD's that
makes me think monk FD is far far superiour
