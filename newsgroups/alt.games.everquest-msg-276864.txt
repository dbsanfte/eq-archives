Yep.  Sony automagically withdraws funds at the end of each billing
cycle; you must actively cancell the billing in question.  What's to
stop the potential buyer from just letting it ride? If you sell the
account, put in the cancellation order before the next billing cycle,
then THAT cancellation order is cancelled by the new licensors request
and billing info (remember, you license accounts, you do not own them),
that then raises red flags in the SOE billing department with regards
to a potential breakage of the EULA (in this case, it would be
correct).  Account gets banned, the buyer's not happy, and everyone but
Sony loses.
