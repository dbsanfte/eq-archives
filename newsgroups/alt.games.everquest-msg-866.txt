Actually, having played a cleric to 31 and usually playing casters, I've seen
too many idiot warriors who pull without checking.  That really wasn't the

I realize that reading comprehension is hard, but we were discussing
irresponsible healers.

Feel free to defend the rights of idiot healers who let their tanks die.
