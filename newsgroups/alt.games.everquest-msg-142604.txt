Yes I think I have understood all your explanations and I bet I see  
now the difference between kiting and rotting.

It seems that the language got all the meaning out of my sentences.
If I had now to write again the same post, I would do the same in 
the concept, the contents, but I would change some words.
All the stuff I read or discuss about around kiting was in English 
language.
*My* idea of "kiting" was kiting AND rotting.
Unfortunately, since one year I have been playing EQ, reading many 
English language-based boards, visiting many websites, but I read 
now and here for the first time the word *"rotting"*.
I do believe you he, I have a curious nature. I did not know 
"rotting" existed, that is all of the point.

As my opinion, it probably explains that a whole concept was 
missing in my argumentation.

But please let you keep in mind that the techniques ([does this 
word exists?]) I have written about are TRUE ways to hunt for a 
Druid and that I personally do use them frequently between two 
ports. What is the name I put on them. :)

Later I may perhaps try to explain again, with other words.
