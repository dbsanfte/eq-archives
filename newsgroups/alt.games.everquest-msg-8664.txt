Heh, exact same thing happened to Rosewhite. She ran from Rivervale to West
Commons to buy her first ring spells (self-only teleports), sat down and
proceeded to scribe them. Just before her second ring was in her book, someone
shouts "Hill giant to druid ring!" Stood up (and interrupted my scribing) only
to see the giant's fist coming down on my head. Woke up back in Qeynos at 18th
level and unable to teleport. Even worse, the ONE spell that got scribed was, of
course, Ring of Commons.

Even WORSE, I was impatient running from Rivervale back to WC and started out
about 6am. Guess what naked, unarmed me ran in to?
