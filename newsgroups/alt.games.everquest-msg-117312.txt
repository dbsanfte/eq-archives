Idiots? Like the ones who think some random spot in N Ro, S Ro, or Oasis is
a good place to sit AND go AFK (AFK message up...no response when talking to
them).  Or back almost 2 years ago I grouped with someone in S Ro, who every
time a sand giant would spawn, he'd try to get close enough to get a
screenshot of it.  Key word there was TRY (he was LV10).  Or the people who
think they can solo the orc camp (at about the appropriate LV where they can
still get EXP from them...conning dark blue).  Or when fighting dervs in N
Ro, someone gets low on HP with the entire group about to die, then
remembers they are bound in Qeynos.  Or the group member who decided to suck
up the EXP by going AFK for half an hour by a derv camp.  As payback the
group waited for a lonely mob to be walking that way and everyone who wasn't
AFK backed up so not to agro, and watch the slaughter.  We spared the mob's
life for doing us the favor in not wasting EXP.
