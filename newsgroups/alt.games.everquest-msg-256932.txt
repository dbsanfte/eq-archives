I have Mantle of Guthank, ImpHeal3 [working on getting the ornate 
vambs for ImpHeal4=)] Crystalline Torc [ManaPres3] and usually 
run with my Blessinf of Faith, and have the Channeling Focus 2, 
but the 1.5 difference can be fairly vital on a patch heal...if I 
need something to go off, I need it to go off fast=)

Poofy does contribute to overall damage, and any DPS is better 
than no DPS=) I will agree that poor loittle Poofy isnt worth the 
mana, which is why I feel sort of ripped off, I would rather have 
something like the enchanter pet that you cant order but sticks 
around [maybe in the form of an angelic, like an air pet with 
angel wings, or a little white wizzy 'demon' Poofy can attack 
from the rear if you wait until the tank has agro and can sic him 
from the rear...just takes moving around the mob, or a MTR who 
does mob placement.

I also had my evoc higher than alteration, and did the sol ro 
quest to fix the specialization, but then I did enough raiding to 
max out my alteration=)

I dont normally need to lock a caster down, I tend to go with 
fairly assorted LDoN groups, my game husband plays a BL, so it is 
always he and his pet, me and Poofy, a tank type [I happen to 
like a good SK or pally, but will go with a warrior as I can 
paci-pull just fine if we dont have a chanter or bard.] I like 
adding a necro and a shammy, and love having mages along, but my 
prize is a bard=) I love bard pullers who know what they are able 
to do=) They are so much more than a mana song! and I have been 
known to start offtanking an add until they polished off the 
original mob=) At least my AC is good for something, and my 56 
summooned hammer procs fairly well as I have a good dex=) though 
I was thinking of getting the little primary hand Delightful Orb 
of Forgotten Magic =)

CH chains are incredibly dull, and above 55 some targets can get 
the who;e raid wiped, and in general the aa/regular xp is 
worthless, there is no loot to speak of, and I would [now] be 
going along as a guest with no loot priveleges so it is really 
not worth my while to do anything but Epic raids. [heck, I will 
do epic raids or fights for total strangers=) I love seeing 
people get epiced=)] so I now pretty much refuse to go raiding at 
all. I have made a couple exceptions for old friends who 
desperately needed clerics badly enough to grant me rolling 
rights on all/all loot. [well, I also like raiding Kael for the 
faction, and I really do love a good ring war=) I have absolutely 
*killer* ToV faction, they love me in Skyshrine=)]
