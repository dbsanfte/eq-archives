    I don't know how smart or dumb this person was, but let me ask you a
question:

If his 34 monk went from 700 AC to 650 AC, then versus the typical set of
mobs in The Overthere by what percentage would the damage he takes increase?

    THAT could have been what the monk was asking when he said "What does AC
do?" I doubt it from the way he phrased it, but it is a valid question.
Anyone coming from AD&D could have answered this question exactly, because
there To Hit probabilities are public knowledge. If someone asked you "what
does STR/DEX/AGI/CHA do in EQ", what answer would you give them?
