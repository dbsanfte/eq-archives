While sitting around bored at work waiting for a test to complete
it occurred to me that EQ could really stand to have some "fun"
new content added to it.  For example:

Flying Wedgie -- this unresistable spell-like effect starts out
similarly to the low level Enchanter spell "Whirl til you Hurl",
except that the target is levitated above the NPC's head while
he spins, and is then flung violently at a random victim chosen
from the NPC's hate list.  The range to the secondary target can
be quite large, depending on the aerodynamic qualities of the
initial target (contrary to the long-held belief of veteran Gnome
punters, plate-armored Dwarves give the best distance, rivalling
the extremes achievable by the best of archers).  Damage (to both
victims) is affected by AC as well as the mass of the flingee,
damage in excess of 30000 hp can be achieved by flinging an Ogre
at a High Elf caster (the Ogre typically takes less than 3000 hp
damage in these cases).  There are uncomfirmed reports of NPCs
showing a preference for flinging Dwarves/Gnomes/Halflings at distant
archers, while Ogre/Troll/Barbarian missiles seem to be tossed
most frequently at nearby robe wearers (supposedly including Monks).

Bowling for Tanks -- similar to the Flying Wedgie, this special
ability uses a player character as a weapon.  Proper execution of
the attack is a three step process:  first the NPC uses a short
range teleport (similar to the Shadow Step spell, but not limited
to equal/lower elevation destinations, some testers believe it's
really nothing more than a deliberate "warp") to gain the necessary
room, followed immediately by the Summonning of an attacker, who is
then thrown in a very low arc at the (by now) charging mass of
melees from the raiding force.  Odd zone-wide messages have been
reported following the execution of especially successful or
unsuccessful "Bowling" maneuvers (i.e.  "stEEEEErrrike!" when large
numbers of secondary targets have been stunned by a particularly
effective shot, and "AIRBALL!" when a quick-thinking Wizard used
Gravity Flux on the initial target during a Zek-simulation test).
Damage from this attack is not as extreme as with Flying Wedgie,
but long duration stuns on multiple targets are common.
