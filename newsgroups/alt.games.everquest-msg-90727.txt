Warriors are one of the most sought after classes in the entire game.
Boo-friggin-hoo.
You have become better at Lamentation! (200)

AAXP?  A number of useful skills to go with it (and some not-so-useful).
Classes below 50th got pretty much nothing across the board.

Soulbinders.

People

I can't swing a dead gnome without hitting a 50+ warrior.

Bind wounds.  Warriors have better caps than almost any class.

Spires to Nexus (Tox to GFay/DL in 20-30mins) or TimDeep firepots to any
starting city.
Thurg gate potions, Overthere Hammers, Leatherfoot Raider caps, Cazic
potions....

With the exception of Luclin, there is a bind site within about 4 zones of
any spot.  If you've not planned well enough to be bound closer to where
you're fighting, you've no rights to complain.  If I'm fighting in KC and
haven't bound in either Shadowhaven or FV, I'm the idiot not the caster
standing innocently nearby.

Keep a spare weapon in the bank, and/or your hand-to-hand maxed.

Your ability as a player is defined by the way you handle your challenges.
I'm not crippled by any of these things.  I move beyond them and look for
ways to circumvent them.
