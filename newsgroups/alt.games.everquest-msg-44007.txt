Taken from the UK version of The Edge magazine. This quote is from
Kelly Flock, CEO of Sony Online Entertainment:

When asked if he takes into account consumer input Flock is
dismissive, relying instead on the expertise of his staff. "No, we
never talk to consumers - they just fuck us up. Someone asked for a
copy of our market research which made us take the decision to do
EverQuest. I said we hadn't done any market research. Had we done, the
game would never have been made. We never focus on them. Gamers don't
know what they want. We just want to know if they have a valid credit
card."
