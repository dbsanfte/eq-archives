So, when you were posting to Usenet prior to TCP/IP you were in the
military or at a defense contractor?

Back then, there were only a few hundred of us posting and there
darned few newsgroups for anything other than technical issues about
operating systems and programming langauges.

That was the late '70s and I was there on  a PDP/11-34 and later a
Cyber.  Sheesh.  Fortran-77 and PL/1 were the "cool languages".
