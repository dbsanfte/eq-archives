    Let me describe two of my friends, A and B. A is married, has children,
works, and doesn't have much time for EQ (a few hours per day, at most twice
per week). He has been playing for roughly two years, though. B is A's
brother. B is single, works, has a bit more time for EQ but not much because
of his social life. B plays maybe three or four times per week, but never
longer than one or two hours. B has been playing for a year and a half or
so. I would classify both of them as "occasional gamers".

    A has a 55 rogue and a 56 cleric, in addition to sub-50 alts. B has a 61
magician and I believe his monk is in the 50's as well, and his druid might
be in the 50's too. All other characters are sub-50. A and B have been
members of small guilds whose greatest accomplishments were raiding the
arena in Kael and working on epics, but they are currently unguilded. None
of their characters have their epics.

    But beyond a lack of No Drop gear, you couldn't tell them apart from
guilded players. Their gear is excellent - Obulous Mantles for mana
preservation, INT/WIS well over 200, all spells for a given level, etc. The
mage, last time I checked, had 21 AA points. If one of them logs on and the
other isn't on, and that person feels like playing one of the mains, they
two-box and can duo both the Necrosis Scarab-Guardian camp and the
Gangrenous Scarab-Iksar Jail camps in Sebilis with the mage and cleric.
Should something bad happen, like they get trained, they log on the rogue
and drag the corpses back to zone-in for the cleric to res. At the end of
the day, all the sellable items are given to the cleric. The cleric uses his
Faithstone to go to Misty Thicket, and from there sells the cash drops for
deposit in the bank and clicks via PoK books to The Bazaar to drop the
saleables off on the sales mule (Lamentations, Iksar Bloods, etc.) He then
gates back to the Sebilis portal, ready for the next day's adventures. Last
time I looked, they had over 25 K pp in the bank for their next big
purchase.

    They haven't even scratched the surface of what they can do in EQ as a
duo. They haven't gone to Chardok, or Howling Stones, or Velk's, or Efreeti
in Sol B, or Skyfire for the cleric's epic shards, or any of the LoY zones,
or Umbral Plains/Maiden's Eye, etc. If they added other friends, like a
crowd control/slow class, the list of what they could accomplish would be
even longer. And they've done this all on their own. I have offered advice,
I have played my twinks with them when they were levelling up (they've
passed all my twinks now, pretty much), and back when I got them to do item
transfers for me I used to give them fair compensation for doing it. That's
it. So when you paint a picture of occasional players as being unable to
access a lot of the content in EQ, I have to laugh. There's a ton of content
out there, at all levels of play. It'll even take people at the highest end
of play some time before they've farmed Time out.

    I think the only thing the occasional gamer misses out on with a timed
dungeon with no respawn is the ability to go AFK at will. That is something
that most occasional players have to deal with, constant interruptions for
real life issues, and having an adventure area with a built-in "pause
button" would have been really nice for them.
