   Aw, pawsha!  Even without the sig file and arrow
tags lines I use, I'm sure that regulars here, both
posters and lurkers, would realize that if Annie M.
Benson-Lennaman posted "Fuk u all u so gay its jst a
gamme so stp playngg wif yur diks you fags!" that
I was being hacked.  My name might make it into a 
few kill files from the newbies to the group, but
I'll wager it wouldn't be many.  
   Now, if thousands of newsgroups got that message,
it might be different.  I might have to change my
email address (thinking of it now, damned spammers!).
But since most of the people haven't seen my name
before, and aren't too likely to see it again, 
in a way it wouldn't matter.  It would be like
someone on Tunare screeching in the commons that
Tealeef Benlen had burned them on a trade scam.
I'd only be upset if it happened on Drinal.

 Annie  <--- Glad to see someone's keeping up
             with the saga of her sig file.
