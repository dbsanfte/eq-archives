<<<<<If I wear more than one piece of gear with Mana Preservation,
does the Mana Preservation effect stack?

Thanks in advance.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Mana preservation gear is really just a crutch used by players that lack the
necessary skill and or talent for EQ.  If you find yourself needing mana
preservation gear you might want to check out Planetside or another game that
requires less skill than EQ.  It sounds like this one may be over your head.
