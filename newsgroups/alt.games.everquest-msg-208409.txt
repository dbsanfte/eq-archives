My Paladin (still my main character) wore full Bronze plate armor
for over a dozen levels, until I quested a full set of Armor of Ro
in his early 30's.

Armor of Ro was great stuff then, and although the quests were
hard at that level, they were fair and a huge amount of fun -- I
still think that's one of the best examples of a well designed quest.
After doing the quests you had seen remote areas you'd never have
been to otherwise, fought mobs you didn't think you could handle
(e.g. Sand Giants, deep Mistmoore, eek!) but could pull off with
some good friends of similar level, and gained a real sense of 
accomplishment.  It was the first time I really felt like a 
traveling knight, slaying dangerous beasts in remote regions just 
like in the movies.

Today, of course, people just buy better armor in the Bazaar for
less plat than cost of just the storebought ingredient portion
of the Armor of Ro quests (2 platinum bars per item), and no one
does the quests.  It's a shame.
