Actually, by now I've posted my 'intro' to the Ye Olde Coffeeshop, but no
where else just yet. I will though, soon. :)

No, Claviger is the PC who is Hartwin's brother. He's my RL best friend. He
was the one with me when we were trained, and is the one who convinced me
that our being trained was a legitimate form of defense for the residents of
Neriak. However, we did another invasion on Tuesday night, and weren't
trained that time, although the danger was there. :) Another party was
invading also, and the residents were running around watching everything.
When one of them saw us (at the zoneline into Neriak Commons this time,
gotta love invis potions), his comment was 'Dwarves too?' It was kinda
funny. :) We RP'd keeping away from the PCs. At one point, in the Commons,
we became overwhelmed (our own fault, not trained on this time) and Claviger
died. After I rezzed him, one of the original people from the first invasion
was there (I don't know that he actually trained on us or was just
supporting the one person I know for sure trained on us), and we had a
heated in-character argument that was fun to RP. Then he challenged Claviger
(level 50 warrior at that point, as he'd just lost a level) to a duel,
although he was green to me at 46. Clav and I debated it, and decided it was
RP for him to accept the duel, despite the huge level gap. Clav accepted,
and it was over with one swipe. Found out later on the guy was level 8.

However, the guy was either really smart, or it was just coincidence,
because this duel occured in front of the Fleshweaver. And yes, the
Fleshweaver then attacked Claviger after he killed the dark elf. It was
actually really funny...once the DE was dead, I saw the Fleshweaver start
casting. I yelled "Run!" Clav just stood there. I yelled "Run now!" Claviger
had his back to the Fleshweaver and didn't realize what was going on. He
just emoted 'Claviger turns to his brother in confusion. "Uh...?", then was
struck by spells. He went from 100% to 38% in one shot, took another shot,
then fell dead. The Fleshweaver stood guard over his corpse as I just shook
my head. All in all, it was hilarious, and I was sort of surprised the
Fleshweaver didn't attack me, since we were grouped, but I'm pretty sure it
was because I didn't have time to heal Clav. If I had, I'm sure I woulda
been toast as well.

Ok, long verbose response for a simple question, eh? LOL

As you can see above, we did go with this option (the dueling) for the
second 'raid', and of course the insults were flying. We did try to move
around a lot so we couldn't be trained this time, and the RP was great.

Really? That's cool; he and I have always wanted to invade starting cities
since we started playing on The Nameless a year and a half ago, but never
did until after we'd moved to Firiona.

Heh, I wouldn't trust them to either. I just noticed this morning that all
the screenshots I took this week, including of the second Neriak raid, are
foobar'd; can only open them in Paint, any other program says they are an
unsupported file type, although they're BMPs (although I would think the
ones from last night, at least, shouldn't be since I followed instructions
and put the line in the eqclients file to make them JPGs).
