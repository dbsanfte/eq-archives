I was doing Gornit for cash, with the nice side effect of 
not even noticing getting through all of 44 and half of 45
while getting the money for T-boots :)

I would never do giants for xp - 
Gornit runs 34-38th and requires
a malisement, 2 SoS's and a Barrier
of Combustion, as I have to use
a water pet for it's better tanking
ability.

Sarnak Knights, however, are also
34-37 ish, They require a Malisement
(mostly insurance) and one SoS after
the firepet's DS has eaten them alive.

The other problem with a static spawn
like Gornit is your XP is limited by
how quick he spawns, not how efficiently
you can kill him (6 minutes recovers a 
decent chunk of mana).
