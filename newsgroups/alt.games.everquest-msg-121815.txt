Everyone knows about playerauctions.com. 

I guess it kind of depends on
the buyer and how badly they want something vs how long it takes to
actually get in this downtime timesink sometimes frustrating "game."

I recently saw a shield of bane warding on my server which was up to
112 bucks with a 190 buyout or something. Call me a loser, but I was
sorely tempted. I've wanted this thing in game for a while but the
quest itself is a huge time sink for parts such as the iksar skel
heads and THEN you have to get enough people together to help you with
the other parts. If I were to apply that time to doing something else,
such as the ability of where I work to have overtime for 8 hours on
saturday and sunday over the weekend (plus 4 dollars per hour if work
the 16 hours, plus overtime on top of that) which of course earns me
brownie points to boot, then you see that doing the quest in a way I
lose money. 100 and some bucks for such a thing looks better and
better.

I didn't buy it, but again, I was sorely tempted. The case of the
50,000 plat is similar. I've never had 50,000 plat, I'll never have
50,000 plat. The highest I've ever had at one time was like 9 k plat
and that took lots of scrounging. I'm not an all pro farmer like some
of these people are who in fact sell the items at such auction sites.
If you really think about it, outside of moral/legal/eula arguements,
it is no different than hiring a lawn service for 25 bucks a week for
something that you could certainly do yourself. People do hire lawn
services, all the time. No one ever has some moral objection to
someone hiring a lawn service, even though its pissing away 25 bucks a
week (at least) for something you could do yourself in a few hours.
Virtual or not, this is really the same thing because it all comes
down to one thing:

Time.
