Not more powerful just useful on high level raid encounters.

It is. Way behind. Many other classes have legitimate beefs
as well for the high end game like mages reduced to CoH and rod
whores and necros reduced to mana pumps.

I wonder how many people actually READ it instead of just jumping
in and ranting that druids are asking for too much.

Yes druids are powerful solo no one argues that, but EQ is a grouping
game and solo is fucking boring and will get you only so far.

I play a druid and I never quad kite, I group as much as I can so spare
me the "but you're so powerful!" bullshit.
