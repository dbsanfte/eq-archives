Umm... really not so much.  The most expensive component you need to do it the 
traditional way is 2p6g, and successful combines sell back to vendors for a 
good fraction of the cost of materials, even non-enchanted.  If you can 
enchant, and bother to, you usually approximately break even.

Naw, not thousands.  To 54, we're talking about maybe 100pp in the worst case.  
Well, I suppose in the worst case you'd fail every combine you attempted, that 
could be more, but the odds of that are pretty dang low. :)

Yeah... except, that's how JC is traditionally done anyway.  Most cities have 
gem-selling guy and metal-selling guy just a few feet from each other.
