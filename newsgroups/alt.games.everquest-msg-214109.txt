Same here, I just can't spare the spell slot for it even solo.

 ... although there are rare times when I'll mem gate while soloing,
times when I'm trying something new and think I might need to bug out
while my pet holds em off for 4 seconds <g>. 

The reason I made that comment is that (IME) people who solo a lot
tend to keep gate up (or another escape spell) a lot more than the
others, even when they group. I admittedly have a very small sample
size but it's universal from what I've seen.
