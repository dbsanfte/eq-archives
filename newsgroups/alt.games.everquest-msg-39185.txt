err, depends on what you mean by best, and how you intend to acquire
them. Are you talking, the best you can buy with 100k pp? or the best
you can reasonably acquire on your own? What race is your SK?

I'll assume you're a non-twinked SK. 

If you don't have at least full banded armor and a fine steel 1hs, 2hs,
piercer, 1hb, and 2hb, then that's where you start.

If you're looking to upgrade from banded, then you should be able to buy
bronze, if you want to, for about 1.5 or 2pp per ac in your server's
auction zone. In either case, in a few more levels, head to Cazic Thule
and start working on your darkforge armor quests.

For other assorted armor pieces, always go max AC. The only exception is
if you are a small race SK, in which case make sure you have just enough
strength so that you can wear your full plate armor and still have a
couple pounds to carry some fine steel loot. Examples of good misc.
armor pieces would be crested spaulders, lizardscale cloak (which you
can just wait and get when you go to Cazic), jagged bands for rings
(should be about 25-40pp each), orc fang earrings, iksar pariah mask
from LOIO (free, easy to get 5AC face isn't bad - just take it off when
buying/selling to merchants), straw spun belt, skull shaped barbute for
helm.

For weapons, some of the cheaper magical upgrades to FS would be runic
carver or axe of the iron back for 2hs; crystalized blades for 1hs (not
sure how cheap these are though), maybe ebon razor if you are a small
race SK; stalag terror spine spear is a great SK only piercer; stone
thunder is a somewhat decent, cheap 1hb to practice with. Or you could
just get velium weapons really cheaply. Oh, and don't forget the lovely
SK-only 2hs Dark Reaver. This is a nice 2hs to have in the late 20's and
early 30's, as it will start procing for you at 30.

Another alternative that may be doable is to head to Runnyeye. You may
be able to upgrade your banded to black alloy (don't bother with the
black iron, it is worse than banded), and get some of the decent 1hs
swords that drop there.

Eventually, your goal is to have full darkforge and max ac items
elsewhere by 35-40 at the latest. I guarantee if you hunt Cazic Thule
nonstop for a few levels you will have some nice earnings in your bank
account as well - save up and try to get a Mace of the Shadowed Souls by
your mid to late 30's as well. You might supplement your bank account by
hunting HG in Rathe in offtime from Cazic once you're 30+.

If you are an ogre/troll SK, you might save up and try to get a full
suit of Sentient armor - it actually has about 1 more ac total than
darkforge, and is all massive +int. Otherwise, if you are any other race
(excluding iksar) SK, go full darkforge, that +sta is really nice.

Hope this helps you.
