Because the regular group gear isn't going to be worth anything on a 
raid. You want to raid Quarm, you aren't going to do that without raid 
gear.

You still do. Raid gear is still better than regular gear. Its just more 
limited where its as uber as it could be. Just as dropping level 65 
recommended gear on a 10th level alt really takes a chunk out of it. Its 
still uber gear, but nowhere near what it is on its intended target.

Similiarly raid gear on single group content will be weaker than it will 
be in a raid. The difference being that it starts out where good gear 
ends, but and the 'extra stuff' adds onto it, when in a raid.
