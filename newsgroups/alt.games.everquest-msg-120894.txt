You might not want to be THE primary healer on major raids but
you're also not going to be totally crippled.   You can turn off any
options that lag your computer, turn off most chat filters, look at
the floor, etc. and still function on upper-level raids.

It's not really the connection speed that will lag you;  it's the speed
of your computer rendering what's going on.  Turning off everything
you can (and having a good, fast computer with a good graphics
card) and using /serverfilter so the data doesn't get sent to you at
all will make you useful for pretty much anything (except *possibly*
being THE main tank healer.   You can still function in CHeal chains,
however, especially if you're careful to look at the floor, etc etc etc...
