Okay so I just get this fancy new Linksys router. I didn't really want
it but the roomies want to put their computers on the same internet
connection as mine. But I get ahead of myself - that hasn't happened
yet. All I've done is connected it to mine.

It *seems* to be working properly as far as I can tell - Internet
Explorer is working, and so is Agent (which is why you can see this
post at all).

But EQ? Fuhgettaboutit! It isn't even getting past the patcher. It
does a file check then thinks it needs to download a Timorous file,
then hangs (never comes close to finishing the file). At this point no
internet activity works, not IE, not Agent, and I have to reboot to
get it back.

I am open to suggestions. Occam's Razor and all that; the simplest
answer is most likely to be the best. Any ideas?
