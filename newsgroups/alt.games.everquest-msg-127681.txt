Group assisting sounds the best option of dealing with this (assuming the
likely chance they are unstunnable for AE).  What levels are each of the
waves?

Hopefully we can get another shot at this soon.. now we have some kind of
idea what to expect we (hopefully) will get further.  Getting caught out by
the re-start of it won't happen again either (thats when it got really ugly)

What ends the chance of the mob, or does he never "poof" like AoW/Shei?

Well were still obviously failing somewhere in our AoW fights.. tank
rotations is something new to us that we've only used for AoW, so Idol is a
"safe" target to practise on.

Until we've killed AoW a few times, it seems a pretty good idea to practise,
without blowing the AoW spawn (we've killed him several times unslowed, with
35+ people still alive)

Yes static list of warriors.

I missed the last AoW attempt, but IIRC the tank order was a point raised
before then... basically start with lesser equipped tanks, with the better
geared ones later on to gain agro better...

Also placing a good geared tank between every lesser geared tank (to better
re-gain the situation if it got out of control)... I think this was raised
before the attempt (may have been after)

Several do have ae taunt (maybe 6 or 7 warlords) and our best tank is about
7150hp (hes a human tho)

Well to be fair.. each time ive trolled other servers boards (not often) I
see the same bitching and whining thats on my boards

One training, somebody was coming to leach faction (they were asked not to..
sigh) and they agrod the Idol / ran it to us...  That was the night of our
first effort.

Firstly he (idol) somehow followed a monk home while pulling (we only had 20
or so people to kill vindi while more logged on)  wipeout 1.  He got bugged
in the arena doors, we had just rezzed and rebuffed, when a shaman saw a
wondering giant in the arena...  he decided to pull it (not realising the
Idols agro range covers almost all the arena) wee wipeout number 2.

The bank one... no real clue wtf happened. A guild was attempting him and
failed. 2 mins later he is wreacking havoc at the bank.. I think somebody
tried to train him to the WL zone (ho ho ho..)

The last one.. sigh what a fucker.  He waited till Idol died, then went into
the arena, to "buy some food".  He came back with the AoW,  deliberate as
hell and no real motive

Well both monks were better geared, but we obviously don't have more HP than
a 60 warrior.. nor we we have taunt.

Ah 4c - thats not where I was refering to (it wasn't there).  I haven't done
4c since the update, but the people in the group who have, said the hidden
temple was much much tougher than 4c

It's one bitch of a pull (not sure theres any point to it either) thats for
sure
