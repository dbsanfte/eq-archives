Yes, very good, Occasional use= some use.  Second, I'll take World
renowned reporters word for it.  And Yes, Rick atkinson is recognized as
a writer as well as an author

Truth is bizarrely like fiction.  I'm not disputing that dexadrine was
also given to infantry.  and I'm not suggesting that pilots were
addicts, I'm disputing your radical claim that pilots didn't use them
and never had them available.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
