Roleplaying is playing a role; it has nothing to do with whether or
not others are around.

Most of my characters spend a fair amount of time solo; that doesn't
mean that I'm a roleplayer with the social ones and a non-roleplayer
with the solo ones.

My druid, Caelashibrar Baker, spends most of his hunting time solo,
but also spent a lot of time around Levels 15 to 20 wandering all over
Eastern Wastes and other places looking for baking supplies.  Was he
only roleplaying when he was grouped?

Reyder Axeman does about 75/25 soloing and grouping, and is instantly
recognizeable by the way he talks.  Is he only roleplaying when he's
in a group?

( I used to play him on a MUD named Apoc V, and spent a lot of time
solo there.  I got and gave a surprise one day.  I play Paladins as
truely as I can, which means I help those in need and battle evil
wherever I find it.  I was wandering through town when I found a
prostitute unconscious on the ground (someone had beaten the mob
unconscious then left it).  So, I healed the mob (you can do that in
Apoc V).  Just as I was leaving, an IMM (who'd apparently been
watching me invisibly) popped up and asked me why I didn't simply kill
the mob for the XPs?  I told him "I don't play a Paladin, I am a
Paladin". )
