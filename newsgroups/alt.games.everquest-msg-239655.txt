You are either being deliberately stupid, or are legitimately stupid.
Given the evidence in the thread, I believe the only logical
conclusion is that you are legitimately stupid.

ig�no�rance     The condition of being uneducated, unaware, or
uninformed.

Apparently you, sir, are the one who is unaware of what ignorance
means. Which almost redefines ironic. It has nothing to do with "doing
something you're not supposed to".


> how, then, is someone ignorant when they know what
>they're doing is wrong and they do it anyway?

Well given you don't know what ignorant means, its not hard to
understand why you wouldn't know willfully ignorant as well. It's when
you deliberately act as if you are uninformed. Which is precisely what
you are doing.

That sound you hear is your ass getting completely whipped, btw. I'm
sure you've heard it many times before.

Art is in the eye of the beholder. I don't consider being deliberately
ignorant an art form. I consider it a sign that you are uneducated and
unaware of the way your poor presentation looks to those who ARE
educated.

In other words, it makes you look like a buffoon.

What you fail to realize is that, how shall I put it... they knew what
they were doing. You're just a wannabe who thinks doing something
different for the sake of being different somehow makes you a poet, or
more highbrow than the rest of us.

Communication is about the audience as much as it is about the author.
You would do well to learn that soon, kid.

The opinion of someone as clearly uneducated as yourself will probably
not weigh too heavily on the minds of the people here, most of whom
are demonstrably smarter than you.

You are not an artist. You are a poser who believes being "different"
or "contrarian" = art.

I never focus on grammar or other faux pas unless the person
demonstrates they know better and still deliberately act ignorantly.
