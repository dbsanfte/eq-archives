Well, just to beat this thead totally to death (and really make me regret
posting in the first place).. if undead don't aggro on the nearest person,
why did the ice boned stop chasing me and run to the other group?  I didn't
run very close to them but I assumed that one of the following happened:

1) Ice boned like to protect each other so it grouped with the other one.

2) The other group KSed it.

-or-

3) What I assume to be the most logical.. when I was running from it at some
point I became slightly further away from it, than it was from the other
group. So, it went after the other group. It does seem like ice boned will
switch targets pretty readily (something I noticed last night while trying
to help someone who was getting killed by one).
