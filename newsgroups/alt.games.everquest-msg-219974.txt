*wince*  You do realize that B5 came out *before* DS9, and DS9 is actually
the copy-cat?  That's like saying that Tolkein was copying Terry Brook's
Sword of Shannara series.

That much is probably true, because of the 5-year arc.  While some of the
later season episodes woudl be good by themselves, I would never encourage
that because B5 is one story you shouldn't see out of order.

Try again.  Endure some of the horrific acting in the first season and try
again.

*still limping from hearing B5 called a snipoff of DS9*
