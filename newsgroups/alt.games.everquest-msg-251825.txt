For shaman, both LoY spells are worth questing for.  Stoicism is only 
worthwhile until you get Torpor or Quiescence, but, until then, it's 
great.  Blood of Nadox is invaluable anywhere you are getting aoe disease 
and/or poison spells cast on you.  Cazic Thule in particular with the AoE 
slow/DoT that gets cast a lot, and on raids, such as Bertox and Trakanon.
