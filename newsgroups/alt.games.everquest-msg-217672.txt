This is taken from one of the patch messages from LDON beta:

"Adventure Timer change.  Our servers keep the exact time remaining for your
adventure.  Inconsistency in the way computers keep time and other issues can
throw the timer off by a few seconds here and there for different players. 
Because we don't want to update every timer every second for everyone on an
adventure, we've changed the timer to only read minutes remaining."

They had  mentioned that some computer clocks are either running too fast or
too slow to keep accurate time.  Near the end of your adventure, ask your
groupmates how much time they see is left.  I'm sure you'll get different
answers.
