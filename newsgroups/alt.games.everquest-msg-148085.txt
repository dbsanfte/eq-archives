Probably the same reason things like the tradeskill trophy (which
realistically requires 252 skill to make) has 5% to that tradeskill.
Geelocks are a dime a dozen, the mods don't stack, and wouldn't take you
over the cap anyway.

Irrespective of what's coming in PoP, the way mods *currently* work is
that they do *not* stack, and do *not* take you over any 252/255 caps.
Extensive tradeskill testing has prove this, as has extensive testing of
the meditate mods. No testing is realistically possible with the combat
mods, and no disproving testing has been provided for any other mods.
Ergo, the conclusion most people have come to is that no mods stack and
no mods take you above cap.

The jury is out on whether they can take you over racial/class caps
below 252/255, such as warrior dodge 175.

Due to the fact that the mods don't even effect the numbers on your
skill screen, I'd be tempted to say a lot of them flat out don't work
