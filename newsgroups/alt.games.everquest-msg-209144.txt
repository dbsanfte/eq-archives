One thing you may want to do is hold on to the equipment and check back when
the dungeon expansion shows up. I am hoping this makes dungeon crawling fun.
Or get a group and try ChardokB it has that "crawl" feel if you do it right.
You fight through to the exit, there is no need to camp anywhere and it can
get fun with a single group. There are easier boss type mobs on the way as
well.
Or get a group with a 'porter or everyone have a gate potion and fight
through Veksar, again much different than the other high end game and pretty
fun with a single group.
Other option would be to go to the test server and create a level 25 of
"that class you have never played" and do something different.

If you are 100% set to give things away, offer up some naked drunken gnome
races from ak'anon to qeynos or something with some helpers placed at the
books to ensure no cheating and hand out more liquor.
Have trial by combat for new paladins using hand to hand naked, or swords
and naked, etc. Make a day of it.
