There is the thing...armor is *FAR* more distinctive looking at it normally
vs inspecting. There is depressingly little variation in how things look in
the inventory boxes.

With few exceptions (belt and cloak are all that come to mind), all pieces
of non-visible equipment are items that would also not normally be visible
RL just looking at someone. To *really* see someone's rings, or earrings,
or necklace, you have to really get up close to them. Personally I consider
that sort of behavior to be really rude. Not to mention caster robes which
obscure everything but hands/feet/head...in order to know anything about
their arms/wrist/legs, you are essentially lifting up their robe without
their permission. RL, that gets you arrested.

Stuff that is invisible without inspecting is generally not very visible RL
either. Again, belts and cloaks are  the only exceptions I can think of.
And most RL belts are never noticed by anyone, unless they are expressly
designed to grab attention.

You can easily tell the difference between platinum and silver just with a
casual glance? That's pretty amazing.

Theres no way that verant can not know that some people are bugged by
inspections. Easy solution: Add in a toggle to disallow them. The people
who don't care or want to show off can leave inspects on, the people who
are bothered by it can be unbothered. Hell, they have an option to turn off
guild invites, and that happens a lot less than an inspect.
