That makes sense...but it unfortunately doesn't help me much in Finland,
since knowing who goes is a matter of whether we are following default
rules or whether there is a yield sign hiding behind that bush.

My theory to this bizarre rule of theirs is that they just treat all
intersections, 3-way, 4-way, or otherwise, as if all directions have stop
signs.  Which certainly encourages cautious driving, but even so when I'm
driving 25 mph it's harder for me to determine the situation than if I've
actually stopped.  No doubt it is something I would become talented at if
I spent more than 3 weeks there. :)

BTW, Bob, my husband asked if you could steer him towards the right
section of the books for learning more about these laws of negligence.
He's been looking through the site I referenced and hasn't had any luck
finding them yet.  I forget the official term for it, but I think sections
and numbers are involved...
