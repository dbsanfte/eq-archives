I don't know if this still happens, but I remember zoning from unrest,
with the low to no health condition and ending up under the world, in
the water at a position which was roughly under the hero camp. Was alway
able to gate out from there.

: Take it as a blessing ;) Also sometimes all your buffs are gone after you
: finished loading, but you dont lose xp or equipment.

This has happened to me a few times, the most critical of which was
zoning, very low on health zoning from Kedge Keep..... 

I was thankful that I had water elemental illusion memmmed and that it
is a relitivly fast cast, I probably would have only glurped once.
