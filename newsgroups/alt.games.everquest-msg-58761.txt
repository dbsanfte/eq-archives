Asking in the EQ-addicts counseling group?

Anyway, here's my list of most-played games the past month or so:

1. Everquest
    Still a rookie considering I have only 1 character at lvl 50 and 1 alt
of 23
2. Unreal Tournament
    I think I can call myself "advanced" now. Played mostly CTF and
Domination.
3. Red Alert
    Networking component doesn't work well. 2nd CD (allied) is corrupt so
normally I only play skirmishes. The few times I did
    play over a LAN I squashed my opponents mercilessly.
4. Diablo II
    lvl 67 assassin, lvl 50 amazone. My younger brother has a sorc in high
80's now which I tend to log in with from time to time
5. Quake 3 Arena
    Ever since I upgraded my pc I haven't been able to get it to work
properly. Everything happens a second after I did it.
6. Arcanum
    Only played with a friend's copy, going to buy it myself soon

That's it for this month :)
