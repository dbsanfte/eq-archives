Sounds like there's a memory leak somewhere and you're running out of
memory.  I had this happen and actually crashed and got a message on my
screen that the system was out of memory.  The particular problem for me
was medding while a bard was singing the mana song, if I either stood up
or got out of range of the bard I was fine.  They fixed that one but it
sounds like there's another one.
