Bards are a completely different animal from all of the other classes.
My guess is that the benefits of the SSS far outwiegh even the most
"uber" offhand weapon that is Bard usable.

I am no expert on ultra high-end drops, so it is entirely possible
that there is another Bard weapon out there that is more desirable.
