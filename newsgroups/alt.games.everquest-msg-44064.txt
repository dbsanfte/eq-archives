>>>SNIP REDUNDANT QOUTE<<<

OMFG, they don't listen to us? They say we don't know what we want?? They
never focus on us??? That's it... I'm organizing a EQ boycott. I'm deleting
my files, burning my CD, going over to all my friends who play EQ and
trashing their files ......


oh, wait a minute,

</sarcasm>

seriously, don't people read the NG before posting? I just love how we get
information twelve times in so many days, with each person acting like they
posted it first. I mean, ... hold on a sec

<rant>

I mean, come on people. what was the intent of this post really? To get us
to realize that EQ doesn't care about the players? That was already pretty
obvious before. And to elaborate on a post I commented on earlier, this is
not talking about customer service. It's talking about marketing research.
There is no customer service during market research, because the product has
not been released yet.

People are gluttons for punishment, and if VI came out and said they will
never support customers ever again, you will still get people who want to
play EQ. If you have fun playing a game, you keep playing that game until it
is no longer fun. Then you find a new game, and start the cycle all over
again.
