Yea but even if you lose it's still good xp, some good coin, and a few
augments.  Sure drops are rare, but even in good drop dungeons I'd usually
pass on items that could be used by other guildies because they aren't
actually upgrades to me.  So augments though not great are better than what
I'd normally be getting.
