And there's the reason necros solo 1-50 (then spend 50-60 either soloing in
SF or LFG everywhere else), we rock!

My level 8 necro can take down yellow young kodiaks and occasionally a low
low red YK, depends what level Jobober over there is, as long as my DoTs
don't keep getting resisted. (if they do, shadow step and run for zone while
pet is sacrificed)

But, we necro's rock in groups too, I was with my level 12 (now 13, don't
get exp w/ him til I level...) warrior friend at the alluring sirens in OOT,
he hardly got hurt taking them down w/ my help (and Jobober), I fed him
health if the sirens started to hurt him a bit, then tapped it back, all the
while using Dark Pact to keep mana up.  Even used the strength feeding spell
to keep warrior going strong ( I carry 23 weight, dont matter if STR is 65
or 55 ), although that spell is 95% useless.

Now, if only I could play for more than 3 minutes before my computer
crashes.
