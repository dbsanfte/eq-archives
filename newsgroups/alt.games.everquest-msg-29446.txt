>> The annoying part about that is VI *supposedly* fixed it so mobs couldn't
hit you if you couldn't hit them. They forgot to carry the 1 or something,
because it's still happening. <<

I hate this. I'll be fighting a mob, the mob will turn to the left/right
slightly, all of a sudden I'm getting the message "you cannot see your
target" in between messages of "target hits you for xxx damage".

I literally have to back up and reposition myself directly in front of the
target. And keep getting hit the entire time.
