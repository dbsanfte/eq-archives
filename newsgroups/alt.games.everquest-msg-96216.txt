Well, I've been chastized by enough monks that it must be true. Damn. It
HAS been too long since I played my monk. I would have sworn that I'd
failed on mend past a skill of 100. But it was either whatever I was
smoking/drinking at the time or maybe I was playing during one of the
bugged periods. Ah, well, thanks for setting me straight.

Can you make smithing be like that now, please? Never fails over 100?
