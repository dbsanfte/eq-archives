Okie... factions to check on would be GuardiansoftheVale (pretty sure that's
Rivervale/Misty Thicket) and JaggedPineTreefolk (not sure of the origin...
pretty sure it's Treants and/or Surefall Glade, tho)

Kill orcs in the E/W commons for Guardians... Gnolls for JaggedPine

That SHOULD see you safely thru the Circles in Misty Thicket and the
Karanas... but I'd have to dig deeper to find out about other druid rings
