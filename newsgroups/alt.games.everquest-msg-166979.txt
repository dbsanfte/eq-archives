If there were indigenous people on the asteroid, they certainly would, 
and damn rightly.

Well, other posters have done as good a job of demolishing your argument 
as I would, so I won't bother reinventing the wheel. I'll just point out 
that Mexico's natural resources did make a country (namely, Spain) 
insanely wealthy, for a while. And Russia's natural resources are vast, 
but nowhere near as accessible as those of the US.

By the way, I'm still waiting to hear how capitalism would make the USA 
the largest economy in the world if it had the population, size and 
resources of, say, Belgium.
