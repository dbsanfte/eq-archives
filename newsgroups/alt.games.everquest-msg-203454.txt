The use of ice should be level restriced.  Those underage (17 in some parts
of Norrath, 20 in others) should not be allowed access to ice.  They have
refrigerators, after all, that are well suited to the purpose of keeping
their drinks cold.

Between 21 and 46 they should be allowed access to cubed ice only, and these
folks should not be allowed to give ice to those underage.  Should they try,
they should receive some kind gentle reminder that this cannot be done ....
say a mild electric shock.

At 46, the sexy, more adult crushed ice can be used.  Again, should someone
over 46 try to bestow crused ice on someone less than 46 they should get a
warning ... possibly a court summons for contributing to the delinquency.

Of course, this is just a proposed framework.  The details would have to be
put in place on the test server and the percentages fiddled with a bit
before bringing these changes live.

And for the love of Pete, please test the changes out on drunk people in
wolf form on horseback walking backwards!
