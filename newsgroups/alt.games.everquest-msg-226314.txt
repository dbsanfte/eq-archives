WinXP requires that you download and run a "compatibility toolkit" to
be able to alt-tab out of EQ. When XP was released, it was coded in
with a list of programs that couldn't be "safely" alt-tabbed out of
(programs that would cause crashes and other such problems if it was
attempted), which it disabled alt-tabbing while those programs were
active. EQ was on this list. The compatibility toolkit allows you to
edit that list and disable the entry for EQ.

Unfortunately, I don't remember the URL to grab the toolkit from. A
Google search should turn it up. And don't worry, it is official M$
software...
