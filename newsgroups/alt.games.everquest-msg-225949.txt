I'm a little unclear as to what you're asking, so I'll answer the following
question and hope it's what you wanted.  =)

When is a good time to start working on cleric AA's?

Well, personally, I found getting Run3 when I was 52 to be well worth it.
It's invaluable in many situations.

After that?  It's an interesting dilemma, because levels mean a lot - not
just new spells, but how effective all your spells are, and how well you
resist stuff.

Because levels fly by pretty quickly after you hit 60, I'd concentrate on
getting to 65 as soon as you can.  Truly, 60-65 goes by like <snaps fingers>
that if you can just keep at it for a few days.  And AAXP is easier to
obtain when you're 65.

Then when you get a comfortable cushion in 65 (say, 10-12%), go ahead and
start working on AA's.  Start with Spell Casting Mastery, as it is
hands-down *the* most important AA you can get.  Don't stop at SCM1, go all
the way to SCM3.

You'll never, ever stop working on AA's.  Currently I'm at 110 AA and
there's still so much I need to get.
