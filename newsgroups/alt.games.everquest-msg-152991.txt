Let me say thank you.  I work with severely abused dogs and have spent over
a year with just one dog trying to get him ready for a home.  I have been
bit 46 times in the past 3 years, all from fear based aggression.  I have to
wonder if what I heard of their life stories is even half of it.

The problem is that in Northern Wisconsin, where the sanctuary is, there are
horrible laws in regards to pets.  This is also componded by the fact that
there is an over population of dogs that are for all intents and purposes,
wild.  Then we have a wolf pack who is struggling with parvo because it
consists of hybrids, the list goes on.  And for every 100 cases, I only get
to save one.  It's heart ache and painful and the community isn't doing
anything to help so it's also like running full force into a wall over and
over again.

So, for those that realize that thre are rescues out there that are just as
good if not better than a puppy, thank you.

And Willie thanks you too, that's one less dog he has to share his
bed/toys/waterbowl/tennisballs/mom with.
