On more sophisticated systems than Windows, you usually *can* copy,
erase, write-over, etc., files that are open.  If you need exclusive
access to a file, you have to ask for it.  Perhaps the original guy
was used to working on real computers, and was not aware of the
limitations of the DOS-on-steroids versions of Windows?

Unix handles deleting a file that someone has open in a particularly
logical way.  Deleting a file removes its directory entry, but the
file still exists without a name as long as anyone has it open.  So,
if program X deletes a file that Y has open, and creates a new version
of that file, Y continues to work with the old version until it closes
it.  Everyone else who opens the file gets the new version.

Not allowing deletion of open files has caused a huge amount of
trouble for people who write Windows installers and uninstallers.  How
does the uninstall program delete itself?  All kinds of really ugly
kludges have been used for this.  They finally addresses that problem
in NT by adding an option to DeleteFileEx that says "delete this file
the next time the system reboots".  On 9x/Me, you can write a section
in win.ini (I think that's where it goes) that lists files you want
deleted or renamed the next time Windows starts.  However, if your
uninstaller doesn't want to make the user reboot Windows, you have to
really jump through hoops.
