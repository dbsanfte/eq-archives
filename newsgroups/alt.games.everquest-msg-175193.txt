18 bucks. I intend to buy it and tack it onto my second account, but I
accidentally bagged it for my first without paying any attention.
Wasn't trying to buy it in the first place, though.

On another note, why the fark can't Frogloks be enchanters? I've
wanted to play a Froglok since the very first time I saw them, and I
just started a new enchanter. He's level 13, but I'd start over in a
heartbeat if he could be a Froglok.
