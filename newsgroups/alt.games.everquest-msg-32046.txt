I haven't been playing nearly as long as you have.  I've been on for about 3
months or so I guess.  I've been having a blast at the lower levels.  I see
the occasional level 5 loser camping a specific spawn but for most people
it's running around, killing, dying, questing and exploring.  Maybe you
should start a new char, something you've never played before, starting in a
city you've never started in before.  Don't twink.  Don't put anyone on
ignore.  Fight something you know will beat you just because.  Hoard up eggs
and honey combs and skeleton bones to make phat lewt. 2pp per stack.
Woowee!

Why worry about leveling.  I have fun with quests and skills.  Between my
characters, I'm a master baker, master smith, master fletcher.  Almost a
master tailor (well I'm at about 50).  36 at pottery, low at brewing no
jewelry at all. I'm also very very very broke.  250pp to master smith.  I'm
at 101.  With my healf elf druid, starting from Qeynos I went to Odus at
level 3, Halas at 5, Highhhold (mail delivery) at level 7. Feydwer at 10.  I
killed a bad dwarf and traded his head in for a 2hb hammer I never use and
can't sell.  I kill scarabs to get armor I can't wear.  Halflings love it.
Makes them look like Marvin the Martian.  I'm warmly to the dwarves and
amiable to the half-evels and high elves.  I went to Kunark to buy an
enchanter her spell at level 14.

The thing that bothers me, is camping.  I'm going to do my best to make it
to what ever level I make it to with out being a camper.  I've heard it's
impossible.  I guess I'll find out.

Good luck.

Lewis
