Thanks to all.  

What I'm looking for is how to be the best bard (or close) you've grouped 
with.  What songs should I be twisting during down time, during Melee, etc.  
Most of the time I'll ask the group what they need help with and try and 
fill in.

I once grouped with a higher level (much higher) bard when looking for 
Lambent quest items.  He volunteered to help me out.  What an enjoyable 
time.  First, the person behind the bard had one hell of a great attitude.  
Very nice.  But he also really new how to play and twist the right songs.  
I aspire to be like him.  So any song combinations you guys suggest is 
greatly appreciated.

M
