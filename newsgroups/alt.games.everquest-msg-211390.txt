Agreed.  As with any activity you do for recreation and enjoyment
there are aspects you don't like or that aggravate you.

It seems to me the things you are referring to are more an issue of
the individual behaviour, which will always baffle and in some cases
irritate.  Nothing to do but continue with what you enjoy.  It is,
after all, a game (an activity engaged in for diversion or amusement).
