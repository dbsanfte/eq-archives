I guess you could say that, but I suppose the lowering of the necessary
reagent could be considered a way of offsetting that oversight.

Considering that all other classes with pets buy thier regeants off of
vendors, maybe we should make thier reagents drop off mobs to offset us?

Of course, we do get a pet at level 1. It's not much of a pet (hey, it's
level 1!), but it's a pet nonetheless.
