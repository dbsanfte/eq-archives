You're wrong.  Sorry, but this is just so much paranoid BS.  MS, like Verant,
gives their customers more credit than this.  No, I am not a MS fan (anything
but), but I hate seeing such disinformation being spread.

How the hell would the system even *know* the serial number of every hardware
and software component of your system?  It's not like there's some standard
Big Brother format for storing that super secret info for transmission back to
Microsoft's labs where they sit twisting their mustaches while making their
diabolical plans to take over the world.

By the way, the CPU ID thing that Intel tried a couple years ago is disabled
by default.

Having said all that, their anti-piracy measures that the registration process
is instituting may cause headaches for legitimate users.  That's all I'm
worried about, and if it's the case I'll be the first to raise hell over it.

You can register XP by phone also.  No net connection required (and thus no
dumping of unauthorized info).

You can already run EQ on a better OS: Windows 2000. :P
