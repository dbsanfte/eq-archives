I did too.  Well, loved is probably too strong a word, but I enjoyed them
both a great deal but felt that there was room for improvement on both of
them.  I had hoped that MoO3 would have done that, but instead they
completely botched it.  The counterintuitive interface alone was enough to
make me toss it out, but the problems certainly didn't end there.  It was
putrid in every single area.

I just don't want to give the impression that my opinion of it might have
been the result of MoO3 not being my type of game.  It really was shit.
