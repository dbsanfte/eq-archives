There definitely will be more options. For one, you can't choose any scale
patterns for iksar yet, nor change any colors beside's the subtle
highlight. We've been assured this will be remedied. They've also said
their art team is working to improve upon the hair as much as is possible
(I assume that means new textures).  I expect we'll see a few other
hairstyles added here and there, and perhaps they'll fix the fact that
eyebrow color doesn't always change with hair color. :P
