   I thought it odd at the time, and still do, that an indifferent necro
would suddenly turn lizardcidal just because he was hailed.  Is it
possible that you conned his pet?  Necro's generally aren't so good at
hiding their hate.

   I remember that.  Hearing the plaintive question in the age channel
"Um guys.. this guy will eventually wander off.. right?"  And the harsh
answer that came back "No".

  Gotta love feign.  I played a necro up to 30ish or so... and I miss,
miss, miss that spell.

   I know what it's like to get stuck in a situation where having the
help of some one who is a bit older can be pretty much needed.  More
than once I've had people pull my bacon out of the fire and help out. 
I'm glad to do the same if I am able, and not stuck in a situation
somewhere (if I am, well, all situations do end sooner or later).
