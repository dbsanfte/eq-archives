Sony To Unleash EverQuest II 
By Michael Singer 


 

Just when you thought it was safe to go back into Norrath... 

The online game world of EverQuest is getting an upgrade in the form
of a better visual engine and a wider reach. 

Sony Online Entertainment (NYSE:SNE), which produces the game, said
Thursday that it is developing EverQuest II for a scheduled launch in
the winter of 2003. 

The new version will take advantage of a 3D engine developed in-house
to generate what the company calls, "an unparalleled visually stunning
3D world." The 3D advances include per pixel lighting, dynamic
environment mapping, and a fully programmable surface shader system. 

Sometimes known as "Ever-Crack" for its seemingly addictive properties
(with more than 13 million registered users, that's a lot of game
junkies), the massively multiplayer online role-playing game has been
going through some improvements recently. In addition to its The
Shadows of Luclin release in December 2001, Sony announced that it is
developing EverQuest Online Adventures as the first in a series of PC
online games for the Sony PlayStation 2. 

Not a bad cash cow for Sony considering that there are an estimated
400,000 subscribers playing the game at anytime, each one paying a
subscription fee of $12.95 a month. 

"It's no secret that we have seen phenomenal success with EverQuest,"
said Sony Online Entertainment senior vice president and COO John
Smedley. "With these improvements to an already great game, we are not
only investing in our growing online community, but also pushing the
boundaries of what the next generation of role-playing games aspire to
be. EverQuest II is the successful embodiment of better technology,
player feedback and our desire to build an online global community." 

Larger in scope than its predecessor, EverQuest II will be able to
host hundreds of thousands of simultaneous users from all over the
world. Sony said it has beefed up its localization features to include
real-time translation in English, French, German, Japanese and Korean,
as well as localized servers in select countries. 

Quest II returns to the world of Norrath in the future of the original
EverQuest. There is a non-confrontational means of character
advancement that including a completely new tradesman character class.

The game will also feature the new ability to own real estate, ride
horses, command ships, and experience enhanced spells, quests and
events.
