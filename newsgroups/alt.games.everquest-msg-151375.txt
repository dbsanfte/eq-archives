I think it depends in part on where you are.  I just had the pleasure
of being part of a pick-up group in Seb that worked out very well,
BattleCleric(tm) master-looter ("cleric commie" in local server slang)
and all.  It didn't hurt that we were a "classic" group, that is, we
had a Warior MA, an Enchanter for crowd control, and a Cleric as
healer, so the rest of us quickly sorted ourselves around this, I
(mostly) kept caster mobs from casting, the second Warrior (replaced
by a Rogue when he left) contributed damage as best he could, and
the Wizard (later replaced by a Necro) gave quite a few of the mobs
a surprisingly quick trip to the showers.

Oh, since I'm replying to Mister BattleCleric himself, I ought to
point out that our Cleric mostly stopped meleeing after we replaced
our second Warrior with a Rogue...  I guess at that point she decided
we were killing the mobs fast enough without her direct assistance.
But, while she was in there I noticed an <awful> lot of procs from her
weapon.  Every fight was like the one in ten where I get a bunch of
procs if I'm using my SotM.  If that's "nerfed" then the original
must've been ridiculous.

Kaev <--- who suddenly likes pickup groups again, for the moment anyway
