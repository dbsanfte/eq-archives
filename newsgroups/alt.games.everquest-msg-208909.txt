Do u have an ATI graphics card?

if u do, kill the control panel in taskbar
i had exact same problem, and traced it to that

hope it helps

kill it from taskmanager
on mine there where 2 references to atixxxx (on XP )
killed them and eq works fine

God knows why it screws the keyboard up, nice one ATI.
