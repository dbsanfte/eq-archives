I would agree with both these assessments, although history tells us that
Blizzard is more likely to postpone the release longer than SOE. I believe
SOE is going to shoot for a holiday release and will make it (whether the
game is ready or not, witness Star Wars Galaxies). Blizzard's schedule is
probably like Id's: "When it's done". The stakes are high, though, and
Blizzard's never really played in this market so the usual rules of
engagement may change. We'll see.
