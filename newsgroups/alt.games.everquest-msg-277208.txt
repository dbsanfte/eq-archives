This info is all for EQ1:

There's no special "agro indicator".  Usually the mob will be facing
the person who has agro and will be beating on them.  If you are
getting hit, then you know you have agro.

Another way to tell is to assist the mob.  Target the mob in question
and type: /assist.  Your target will switch to whoever has agro.  This
is useful if the mob is not able to beat on someone because it's rooted
or mezzed.

Another way is to use one of the leadership skills. I think it's called
Health of Target's Target.  If your leader has that skill, then you can
have an additional "target" window that will show the target of the
person you have targetted.
