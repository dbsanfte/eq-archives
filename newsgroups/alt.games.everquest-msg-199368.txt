My dark elf cleric of tunare who is level 42, also known as "crazy up
the bum faction raiser", is trying to get non kos in Kaladim.

The stormguard/cleric/pally guild were incredibly easy. I started with
halfling one use form mask and loads of CB belts in kaladim at warrior
guild. Later I got the mask again and used about 250 bone chips in
pally guild. 

FYI: 

The bone chip raiser is weird because I stopped at amiable in halfling
form, backed around corner to con, found I was amiable in dark elf
form.. weird. Perhaps I was threaten to start, can't remember, but
halfling got me to dubious originally.
So its kind of fun to hang out at the cleric and pally guild as an
amiable dark elf in kaladim.

Now the problem is that the only way to raise the last KOS faction in
kaladim, miner's guild 628, is quests with them or killing the bandits
in butcherblock. They seem to be the last mobs to raise it outside of
high level goody mobs, which would defeat the purpose (since they are
on good kaladim factions)

Halfing or dwarf form (since there are dwarf form potions now) gets
her to dubious to the dwarves. Via using the hand in/hide skill/ then
complete trick, she is able to do the quests such as Giant Rat Pelt
one at an Indiff con. This is NOT enough though, evidently their
quests require amiable.

I bound at one bandit camp in butcher, running back and forth between
them killing bandits for several hours. When I went back to kaladim to
check, I was still kos as a dark elf, SCOWL, still in fact.. so I
presume I'd still be dubious in dwarf form. I saw no dwarf essence in
the bazaar though, plus blowing 150 plat or so on it just to check
gets old.

So I guess its just bandits, A LOT?

Sadly all of the stupid bugs in Rathe mountains that used to raise
some stormguard as well as miners 628, LONG AGO, were nerfed long ago.
Since then they only raise or lower the ankfetn or ank something else
bugs. When I started on solusek ro they were a nice way for an evil to
get non kos, while getting XP. The bugs were a much faster respawn
than the bandits, if I remember.

FYI:

For the rat quest the guy offers it is 
GIANT RAT PELT
Nothing else works. As you might guess,
GIANT RAT PELT comes off of GIANT RATS
and does not stack.
Giant rats are mostly in Qey hills, though other
rats like field rat or large rat are there who don't drop the pelt.
Shopping around qeynos I found something like 35 
GIANT RAT PELT for the quest, this was only a few
days after the last patch, so even on a server like the tribunal some 
newbies are getting them and selling to vendors.

So the quest item to raise faction is easy to get, once I'm amiable in
dwarf form from killing stupid bandits.

More info:

No, the banker is not on miner's 628, but rather merchants
of kaladim (verfied with my wood elf druid who is ok there)

My dark elf just wants to raise these guys so she can go into the
bank, though I have all expansions, without being KOS. Running into
kaladim is just fun for the reaction of dwarf players.

I'm still dubious to merchants as well, which makes me think that
starts in the hole enough that you'd be KOS, but merchants can't be
more than DUBIOUS? I raised stormguard from dubious to amiable mostly
on quests that also raise merchant faction, yet it has not budged.
Among them I've bought out kaladim of scarab type shells and done the 
scarab armor quests a lot ;)

Innoruuk brotherhood is lowered from the billion cb orcs I've killed,
but this is not really an issue since it is only the neriak warrior
guild as well as some ambassador guy in the basement of the maiden's
fancy bar.
