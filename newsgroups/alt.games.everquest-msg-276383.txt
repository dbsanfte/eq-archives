Sounds to me like EQ1 continues to spiral downward. With EQ2 getting all the 
attention these days (and probably requiring far more CS representation), 
the server consolidations, the brief window of opportunity to capitalize on 
Blizzard's current server problems with WoW, it doesn't strike me that EQ1 
CS is going to get a lot of priority cycles. Which is about as dumb as 
Apple's decision to abandon the $600M educational market and the multi 
billion dollar Apple II market when the new darling, Macintosh, emerged. 
Chasing new markets is good, but abandoning your base to do it is stupid.
