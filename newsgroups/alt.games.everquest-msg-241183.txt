You'd be surprised. A lot of the newer players are skipping kunark and
velious to a large degree... some of them actually do want to go back
and slum around... for them its new, even if the loot is garbage.

A guild that raids 7 days a week, expects AA grinding in between
raids... and your going to make them have fun in their offtime? Lol...
these people barely have lives as it is...

Given that you are controlling the raid issueing what appears to be a
small amount of pre-scripted 'generic commands'. Scripting that
shouldn't be that much additional work. Sure if something goes outside
anticipated parameters the raid will wipe badly...  but you claim that
you'll have all these little mini macros for handling these various
contingencies you expect... it shouldn't be much additional work to
automate detecting the contingencies and respond to them. ;p
