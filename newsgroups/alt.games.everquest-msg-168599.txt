Prepare to slap your forehead....
 I did.


I had the same problem. After a long bout of troubleshooting, I found
something out. My wife had purchased call waiting. I use dialup. 
All those periods of lag were when someone was calling in. I don't know
why I never got packet loss readings on the bars, but it all came back
to normal once the person hung up and the call waiting tone stopped
coming in.

if you dialup, put a *70, in front of your dial number.
