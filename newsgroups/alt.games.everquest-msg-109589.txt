LOL... do you KNOW how much it costs for EACH skill-up past 200 in
blacksmithing???
And how RARE those skill-ups ARE???

People are spending between 1 and 2.5 THOUSAND plat to gain each skill-up
after 220. It's not uncommon to make 200 attempts and still not get a single
skill-up. That's 200 'quality' pelts, 400 spiderling silks, 1200 large
bricks of MQ ore and 600 flasks of water... that's what it takes to make 200
Fine Plate gauntlets (currently trivial at 235... for cloaks, use 1800 MQ
ore and 800 water).

At skill 190 you have roughly 38% chance of succes on a Trivial-250 item...
at skill 200 that chance rises to about 50%. There are only a few
non-jewelry items that can currently be made that are superior to Planar
gear... and to make THAT stuff you need to be of a high enough level to have
'done' the planes (at least Fear/Hate) and be moving into areas (Like
ToV/Dragon Necropolis/Sebilis) where better stuff drops (rarely, but it's
still available).

To make Elven Cultural Armour, you need to be in a low/mid 40s Mistmoore
raid (to clear and hold the jail), spend 4 hours getting 6 Essence of
Moonlight to drop... which gets you THREE tempers (if you have Brewing 135
and get lucky by not failing any combines) to attempt 3 items (which,
bizaarly, require FORAGED Morning Dew, and no High Elf can ever forage...
they can't play Bards, Druids or Rangers!). Just count how many Koada'Dal
Mithril Plate Cloaks there are on your server, then count how many Heiropant
Cloaks there are. :o)

You still can't even make a weapon as good as the stuff that drops in LGuk!!
