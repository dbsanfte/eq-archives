Actually, unless they've fixed it even if you DO NOT have SoL installed
you're gonna go up...of course, then you're stuck since you won't be able to
access that character until a GM brings you back to Norrath....

15 mins, supposedly (I've only used it once...seemed longer).

Again, unless they've fixed it, if you're in the ring of spires you're going
up...with or without the shard.

Unless they've fixed it, getting a port from a wizard to any of the
Nexus-enable spires is a scary proposition if you don't have SoL
installed...it's quite possible (though unlikely unless you go afk during
zoning) that you'll pick JUST the wrong moment to port to GFay, only to be
yanked up to the moon by the Nexus Scions.
