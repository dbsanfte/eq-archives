Has anyone had any problems using the following while playing EQ?  Just
wondering cause I'm outfitting a new comp an checking to make sure there' no
known problems, it's been close to a year since I've played... *GRIN*

-Wireless Keyboard and/or Mouse
-Trackballs (I'm trying to get the best directional control  possible, and
make running around easier if there's any ideas out there any other
ideas...)
-ATI Radeon Video Card

And if there are any tweaks for Windows98 2nd edition (or version or
whatever... hehe I'm not very tech oriented.) they would be much
appreciated... I am using cable through the @home service from Rogers in
Toronto for what it's worth (in case any local folks know any tips) I'm
upgrading to enhance gameplay primarily.

Thanks much in advance.
