  I'll be disappointed if "MMORPGs" don't eventually evolve to the
point where these things actually happen.  However, I remain skeptical
of claims of how things will be until the games actually go gold and
are a reality.

  I was reading a file the other day which was sort of a "guide to
EverQuest" before EQ was completed.  Part of it claimed the designers
claimed that lycanthorpy would "definitely" be a part of the game, and
that players could be come cursed and become werewolves.  I don't know
if this was misquote, or something that Verant actually claimed, but
we know the reality is that in EQ today, werewolves are just another
mob, and the closest you can come to "becoming" a werewolf is a mere
illusionary spell.

  And becoming a werewolf, I think, is a lot less ambitious of a
design goal than the things you describe.

  I have high hopes, and I think eventually MMORPGs will have a lot
more depth than they currently do, but whether or not it'll happen any
time soon, and which games will actually introduce the
revolutionary/evolutionary features, I can't say.
