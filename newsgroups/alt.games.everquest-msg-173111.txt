All of the men and women in uniform are protecting your ass and mine
for very little pay, and generally no recognition. They don't get to
pick and choose where they are sent. Many die in training accidents or
in classified operations that neither you nor I will ever know about.
The USA has an ALL volunteer army. Show some respect.

No matter where US troops are sent they are fighting for us (US
citizens). You have NO right to sit comfortably in your home and look
down upon those men and women that choose voluntarily to put their
lives on the line and their trust in the US government not to waste
their sacrifice. The President and the Joint Chiefs of staff do not
get their news or information from the spin doctors at ABC/CNN etc.
There are a LOT more people involved in the decision to send troops
than just Bush or Cheney. If the full weight of the US government
wasn't behind the mobilization, it wouldn't be taking place. Don't let
the "peacenik" sound bites politicitians fool you into thinking that
Bush is acting alone. They are simply padding their political position
so that they can scream "I told you so!" if/when something goes wrong.

What is "bullshit" is people like you who think 9/11 was/is an
isolated incident and that their is no real threat from rogue nations
such as Iraq (who finance and support terrorist organizations and have
a deep seated hatred for the US). You further compound your "bullshit"
by insisting that "oil" or "political(economic) gain" is the only
reason we are going to take SH out. Anyone who can't see that the
world would be a better place without a psycho like SH running Iraq
should have thier head examined.
