According to Niami DenMother (whose name will be familiar to anyone familiar 
with EQTraders.com, or who spent any time in the Crafting channels of 
Beta1), Antonia Bayle will be the RP server and Runnyeye will be the English 
speaking Euro server. Niami has had a number of inside scoops from the EQ2 
PR team based on her site and her past comments have been substantiated, so 
this looks credible.

Haven't made a final decision where I'm going to play. Although I welcome 
the designation of an RP-preferred server, it's likely to be the first 
server flooded at release and this has good points and bad points.
