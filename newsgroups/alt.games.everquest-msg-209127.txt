I don't believe that is the case, but, if you are far enough away, the 
mob will not come towards you.  Not sure that a bolt has that much range.  
If you get closer to a mob that hates you as a result of damage you did 
earlier, it will head straight towards you.

Pretty much any spell that causes direct damage, or melee attack has a 
chance of breaking a root when it hits.  It still works fairly well with 
the bolt spells, as you can be far enough away when you cast the bolt to 
have plenty of time to reroot the mob before it reaches you.  Then, move 
off again, and nuke away until root breaks again.  I was doing this in 
Paludal Caverns with my wizard at levels 8 to 10.
