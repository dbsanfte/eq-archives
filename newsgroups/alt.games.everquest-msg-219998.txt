/agree

When describing EQ to someone who has never played, I have found they 
either find it very interesting or incredibly stupid and boring. If the 
latter is the case, I just stop right there and advise them not to bother 
with it then, because it's obviously not the game for them. No harm, no 
foul.

The trouble is, that is the exact same crowd that SoE appears to be 
catering to these days. In trying to make EQ more interesting and 
accessible to those who will likely not be willing to dedicate too much 
time and/or effort to the game anyway, they run a very real risk of 
effecting changes for the worse for those who are. Hello, SoE, let's look 
at the big picture here.

The often-overused metaphor, "slippery slope", comes to mind.
