I've been wondering the same thing.

I've also spent a lot of time wondering how they managed to
code horses in a way that would break so *many* things.
For example, spells which rotate you to face some direction
or object (e.g., locate corpse, sense the dead, true north,
etc.) *still* are totally broken if you're sitting on a horse
(I test and /bug it again after every patch).  And yet, I
can't think of *any* way I might have chosen to code horses
which would have made any difference whatsoever to how
those spells operated.
