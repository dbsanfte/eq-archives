You misunderstand, or I was insufficiently clear.  I forcefeed both food
and water routinely, hitting the hotkeys to do it far more often than
it is actually consumed (I get "... you would explode" messages about
10 times as often as "Ahhh..." messages).  So I watch my stacks of food
and drink decrease routinely.  It <seems> as if the food:drink ratio
shifts towards food when I'm fighting most of the time.  But I've never
actually tried to verify this.
