Bought Ornate Rune blade for 1k sold it for 4k.
19/30 +5ac +3 on saves (2hs) would never be worth 18k. Used to be 6k on BB,
dropping all the time.
You did real good tho, 450pp for a yak and an Ornate Rune blade.

No Forget EQ prices and all other price guides, market changes to quick and
as the price starts to drop people no longer post about the item (because it
is now old news)
Crystalline Short Sword for 1k? Wouldn't pay you 100pp for that PoS. The
Crystallized Short Sword, on the other hand, is about 12k and I very much
doubt you saw one for 1k, if you did someone got a great deal  (12/24 1hs
plus a bundle of stats)
No, this is a free market, it's capatilism, supply and demand, not communism
where you would be forced to sell for a set price.
I'll give you some examples,

Shiney Brass Halberd 16/48 2hs used to be around 100pp...can't give one away
now.
Blackened Iron Bastard Sword, once about 300pp now you'd be lucky to get
50pp
Runic Carver and Executioners Axe both were once 2k now you could get either
for 200pp

This is because there are better weapons available, some at lower cost (I
once payed 5pp for an Axe of the Iron Back)

But there is more;

Crafted BP used to be 2k now you shouldn't pay more than 800pp (Haggle, you
should be paying less)
Mitheral BP used to be 1500 now around 700pp or less
Rygorr Battlemail (this is a velious drop so relatively new) once 2k now
under 1k (this also killed the Mith BP price)
Ykesha's (Short swords) I can remember when they were 7k each as was a Mith
2 hander, you can get both now for 1k and less (as you've just seen)
Mace of Shadowed Souls (a 19/29 1hb!!!) around 2k from around 10k

These items haven't really been replaced by better items, they are just more
common now. There is nothing in the 2k range that matches the dam ratio of a
Mith 2hder and few weapons are better for a 37+ dual wielder than SSoY's
when they start proc'ing.

Thats right the price guides are wrong, welcome to Everquest. What you (or
your son) has hit upon is how I (and many others) make money and buy nice
equipment, without being twinked.
You got some good trades there, mind you, if someone offered me 200pp for a
weapon I was asking 5 times the price for I doubt I'd even give a reply.
The market is to volatile to have an accurate price list this also puts the
risk in trading. I passed up on a shield of stalwart seas for 2k, a week or
so ago, thinking maybe the market value (limited on buyers, Erud Pally only)
had dropped that much, apparently not, someone sold one last night for 20k,
ahh well for all I knew I could have been left with an item that I couldn't
sell and 2k down in plat.
