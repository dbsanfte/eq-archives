There are a couple of approaches...

1.  Put a big damage shield on the bard, have him wade
into a batch of mobs, and just make sure that he personally
does at least one point of damage to each mob before the
Damage Shield kills it off (he won't get credit for any
mob that is killed 100% by the damage shield).  Heal with the
druid as necessary.

2.  Have the druid nuke the mob down to a sliver of health.
Have the bard charm it.  When charm breaks, the bard can kill
it easily and will get 100% of the exp (any damage done before
charming doesn't count).
