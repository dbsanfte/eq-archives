*sigh* I was REALLY hoping they wouldn't do the EQ-in-a-window thing 
until they'd fixed that little problem.  And as my keyboard no longer 
worked using eqw with Test after they patched it this way, I suspect 
I'll find the same thing with EMarr.  There goes easy transfers and 
bazaar mules for the foreseeable future. :(
