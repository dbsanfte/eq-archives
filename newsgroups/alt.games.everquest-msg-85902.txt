How much gear on any uber character is tradable?  Resist jewelry maybe.  
Weapons, most armor, etc is going to be no-drop anyway.  If someone wants 
to pay the $50 for the move, plus the extra $30 for a month on the Legends 
server, plus the second account fee, I guess they could, but wouldn't it 
be simpler and faster to just move over naked and have whomever you're 
coming to join help you regear?
