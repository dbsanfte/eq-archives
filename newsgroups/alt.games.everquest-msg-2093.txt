Robert,

I'm a relative newbie at EQ myself,  as I've only been playing a couple of
months. If you are a Human monk, you can definitely buy  another tunic to
give your Monk his "Monkish" look back again. It'll be called a "Torn Brown
Shirt" and one of the vendors in FP sells it... I can't remember which one,
you'll have to try them all. I can only assume that Queynos would have a
similiar setup.

 I don't know what the Iksar equivilent is, and I don't know if the same
holds true for them.

As the other folks suggested, I'd start on raw silk. I dumped every training
point into tailoring that I could, which made the swatches trivial. When
grouping I asked to loot spiders, and let the other members loot all else. I
ran around naked until I could make my own raw silk stuff, a piece at a time
:)  Now my monk is lvl 19 and has made his cured silk, well everything but
the Kiolas as I paid a guy with high brewing skill to make those for me.

I bought a pair of mesh gloves cheaply at around lvl 10, which I finally
traded out last night for Wu's fighting gauntlets for an outrageous price.
My monk fights mainly with his fists, though I do try to practice other
diciplines occasionally.

 That may not be the best way to do things, but it's  worked for me so far.


Have fun,
Matt K
