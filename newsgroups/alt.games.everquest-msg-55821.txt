This is what I saw:

EK - Good drops for all classes.  Some stuff more rare than other - the 
warrior sword, bard mace, and ranger cap for instance.  After the Quest was 
completed a few times ( loot for doing it -> Essence Emerald! ), the high 
levels weren't finishing the quest so that people could get "stuff".  It 
lasted over 4 hours one time, and may have been like that several times.  
I'd say the average lifespan of the EK loot-fest was 2-3 hours.  Most 
people would shout out the loc of anything they didn't need, which was 
nice.  Of course, there were the people paying for LOCs of items, and a few 
people looting anything they could and bragging about how they had every 
item, even though they can't use them all.  My favorite were the people 
trying to sell the droppable book.  This made me loot them and give them 
away to any caster I saw who didn't have one.  My 9th level cleric would 
pretty much wander freely here, as there were 200+ peeps in the zone.  If 
anything attacked him, I would cast my Divine Aura spell, and before it 
wore off, someone was killing it.

NRO - I was only there for about 45 minutes, doing tailoring, and it was 
horrible.  Some high-levelers finished the quest in what was apparently a 
"Newwwwww state record!" so that the low level people couldn't have their 
fun.  Very sad.  Verant didn't think this one out that well.  They had to 
know this would happen and that letting it be up to the players to handle 
it just doesn't work.  They could have made the Mob(s) you had to kill 
invulnerable to anyone they conned anything but red to or made it totally 
invulnerable for a set time or make it not appear until 30 minutes into the 
event.  ANYthing but the way it was done.  I told the people whining to go 
to EK or Rathe where it was easier to get stuff, even it the mobs were a 
LOT harder.  Good supply of Zombie Skins, though, for pottery.

RMntn - Scary.  My highest guy is level 34, and was able to kill a few 
things, but I was mainly a clarity whore in there.  The bodies at the zone 
lines were IMPRESSIVE.  A couple 500pt AOE cold spells could ruin a lot of 
peoples' day - including my chanter's.  I helped a couple guildies get some 
stuff in here, showing them the safe spots to hang while the high level 
guys killed stuff.  I would clarity and mez a few things, and they were 
very nice in letting my friends loot items.  My 9th level cleric got 
everything for his class from here and only died once the whole time - I 
just hugged the walls, asked people very nicely if I could loot any CLC 
items that they don't need, and they were very accommodating.  The staff 
that dropped here wasn't dropping in EK, nor was the caster Robe.  Does 
anyone know how to end this one?  It started on my server and never ended ( 
as of last night ).

WC - I was there for a very short time, but saw some decent stuff dropping.  
People were very friendly and helpful with buffs, etc, to the low levelers.

QH - Was only here long enough to log in my Necro and get him out of the 
zone.  Saw a lot of skellies.  Varsoon was dropping the GBS off and on.

All in all, it was pretty much just a loot-fest that brought out the best 
and worst in people in typical EQ fashion.  I wasn't here last Halloween, 
so I don't know if this was normal.  If not, I would say it's Verants way 
of trying to get people not to leave the game if they can get some free 
Phat Lootz.  Between my 4 characters, I think I got all the items ( except 
a doll someone mentioned in this thread.  Where does that drop? ) and will 
be using pretty much all of them except the warrior neck item, one of the 
cleric items, and the CHA bracelet for casters.  If this is indicative of 
upcoming events, I can see Christmas being crazy.

I wish they would have made new models for some of the items, though, 
especially the caster robe.  I also collected a 10-slot backpack full of 
silk swatches - not silks, but swatches, in EK from the spiders that didn't 
get looted of their normal stuff.  I cranked my tailoring up to 87.  Now I 
have to find a deserving Monk to give the 2 Wu's Gauntlets to ( went 2 for 
2, with 2 skill-ups [ 86 & 87 ] )!
