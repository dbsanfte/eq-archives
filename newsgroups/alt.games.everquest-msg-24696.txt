Congrats on that one... I have an alt Erudite SK as well, and despite the
howling about that it is, quote:"Pointless, no str, no agi, no sta" I really
love him !

Its strange, but I noticed that the Freeport guards only con dubious without
having any major faction work done. So you should be fine... I think ! I
didn't try to confront them face to face though... And btw, I think the
tunnels are a _nice_ way into NFP anyway...
Havent tried anything else so far, he is only level 19, and I wont leave the
warrens till 22...
Without being twinked, I reached level 19 in 4 days 5 hours... the warrens
are a really nice place to hunt in, although the growing popularity sort of
reduces the benefits.
I also think that after the last patch those kobolds hit harder, and the
molars dont drop that often anymore... anyone noticed this or is it just my
imagination ?

ok, this was sort of OT, but I hope it helps anyway :)

Cya,
