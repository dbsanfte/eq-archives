My beastlord is 55 and halfway to 56... solo'd about 90% of that.
Only need to group for HIGH level dungeons or planes. Or just for so
company.

Yes... especially if no shaman is available. Groups love the kitty
crack ;-)

LOADS!!

Thats a tough one to answer.. depends on your fighting style. If you
melee with pet.. then I'd say str, sta and agi (ac) too are good
bets.. if you play pet cleric then get all the wis you can.
I do a little of both, so I have my str and sta up.. still working on
AC.

Pets are now summoned at full level.. you just have to put buffs on
them.

As someone else stated.. that is mainly preference.
I chose a Vah Shir for a few reasons.. first new and novel ;-)
Although ogre and troll had really good starting str and sta (and
troll has regen) and iksar had high wis and regen.. I didn't want to
play another evil race and have to worry about faction EVERYWHERE I
went. I chose vah shir over barbarian mainly due to the night
blindness issue. Hehe, already went thru that with a human ranger and
didn't like being blind at night.
Plus I think Vah Shir is the IDEAL race for beastlord.. good faction,
not night blind ,decent stats. and racial safefall really comes in
handy also.
