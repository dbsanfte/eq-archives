Let's think about this for a bit, shall we?  The /con command involves no
in-game skill--it always works, 100% of the time, 100% accurate.  It takes
no in-game time--you don't miss an attack by using it, or interrupt your
casting, or have to stop moving.

The /con information is information that in-game your character is supposed
to be able to determine at a glance, and all this change does is unclutter
the interface.  It doesn't dumb down the game like your whine implies.
