I was in a hill giant group last night with a 42 druid, 39 warrior and
something high 30s paladin and my 32 cleric self. We had a ball kiting
giants- the druid cast snare, and dotted, while the warrior and paladin
whacked the giant from behind. I ran around in circles doing whatever
was needed - heals, stuns, buffs and nukes- and the druid and I both
stopped to med up between pulls. They really didn't need me there, but I
certainly had a lot of fun. And yes, this is very unusual behavior for a
cleric. I'm the only cleric I know who's evocation is better by miles
than their abjuration.

For anyone waffling between the two classes, start one of each. Try
both. See which one you like better. I have a level 6 druid that I
started about the same time as my cleric. I'm level 32 now... gee, I
wonder which I liked better? /grin.
