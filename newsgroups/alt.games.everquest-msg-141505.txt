Yes, through /auction, but you may not find as many buyers unless you are selling
local items (such as frost giant heads and toes in GD).

On The Nameless server where I play, EC used to be the trading zone, now it's
deserted except for the newbies.

You can still have fun playing without the expansions... the game hasn't changed
much in the older zones.  If you liked it then, you'll like it now.

Most of the newbie zones got revamped to include newbie armor quests, which
are pretty nice.  The only significant change to an older zone (that I know of)
is Cazic-Thule.  That is a high-level zone now.
