"People" is such a nebulous term. There are "people" who would love it
if EQ became a first person shooter. Hell EQ might even be more
popular than ever if it did, if it became a massively multiplayer
Hexen.

But that doesn't mean they should do it. The people who play the game
are the ones who like what it is, and if it changes the people playing
change too.

EQ became the most popular mmorpg without any of this silly instancing
or fractionalization. Why did it have to change so drastically?
Especially since it has never grown anywhere near as well since it
started?

I'm not ignoring it. If I were to invoke everything that has been and
is going wrong with EQ in one post it would be a very long post. But
there's so many problems I can usually just stay with ones that
directly relate to "solutions" (using the term loosely) suggested
here. It does not mean its the only thing I find wrong.
