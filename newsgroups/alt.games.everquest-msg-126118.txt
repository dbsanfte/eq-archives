After spending a LOT of time away from EQ, I finally needed another fix.  
*g*  I've deserted my shaman, though, in favor of a DE rogue I made on E 
Marr.  I'm finding that fighting is a lot more interesting than 
meditating all the time, at least...

Anyway, a couple questions.

1 - The guild I just joined is doing a raid of Befallen soon, and I 
would kind of like to look it over before we go.  Does anything in there 
see through sneak/hide?

2 - I managed to get myself a few piercing weapons.  Walrus tooth, 
focused etherial rapier, and tombcarver.  Anybody have any suggestions 
on what to use in which slot?

and finally, on a rather unrelated note, do any tailored bags besides 
the backpacks sell?  I'm wondering if I should give players a chance to 
buy them and make a plat or two, or just sell them off to the nearest 
merchant (seems like such a waste of all that effort...).

Ryou
