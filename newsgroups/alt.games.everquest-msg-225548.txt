Wouldn't bother me one bit.

There's no regulatory agency out there forcing people to abide by such 
deals, and there's precious little in the game that can't be gotten by 
anyone who's willing to exert the effort required to get it.

Personally, I take a look on /bazaar for what the item I'm selling goes 
for, and then price mine well under the current lowest price.  I don't 
talk to anyone about what I should charge, and the only way anyone could 
raise the price on my item would be to come buy it and put it up for 
sale for the higher price.

I don't set up in bazaar mode often, and when I do, I want to clean out 
a bunch of stuff that I'm not going to use fast, not squeeze every 
copper out of it that I can.

I appreciate that some people love the buy/sell part of the game, and 
they are welcome to it, I'm just not one of them.

In fact, my fondest memory of the buy/sell game is from back when the EC 
tunnel auctions were THE way to do it (none of your fancy chat channels 
either), and there was someone in my guild who loved playing trader; 
he'd take whatever I had to sell and get rid of it, taking a 30% cut off 
the top, and would also buy things I wanted when they came up, adding a 
30% surcharge on top of whatever price he could get the item for.

On top of that, he used to take my cash and buy up any great deals he 
could find, and sell it off at a profit, keeping all the profit; 
sometimes I'd want my money and it wouldn't currently exist in cash form!

Sounds weird, but all I had to do was drop by occaisionally with 
whatever loot I had collected, and occaisionally pick up cash or new 
gear I -did- want, and update my wish list every now and then.

Bazaar mode is  sort of like that, and much more efficient, but I have 
to screw with it... frequently I don't bother, just dump stuff to 
vendors even though I'm pretty sure it would fetch more in bazaar.

I =do= like being able to shop and compare, though, I never knew half 
what was available back in the EC days (even when something was on 
auction there were no links, you couldn't see the stats unless someone 
posted them... and we had to cross Everfrost barefoot, uphill both ways, 
to buy anything, and we Liked it that way)

Splendid
