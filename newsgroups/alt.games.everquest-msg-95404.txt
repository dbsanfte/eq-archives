Ok, not a KS story; but I tried an Erudite Enchanter on FV the day it went
live and we had a problem with people dying and then immediately sitting
down to mem spells. Next guy dies and respawns, couldn't find the ground,
kinda jittred up and down for a bit then fell to his death. There were
dozens of Erudite corpses just at the spawn point at any given time.
