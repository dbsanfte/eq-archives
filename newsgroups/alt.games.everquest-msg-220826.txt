  Agreed, if I'm grouped I usually have a cleric with me that tends to
overheal anyway (just can't seem to train her <g>). I just can't
decide whether to wait for 51 and get Tae Ew or just break down and
buy a crypt robber's.

That seems to be the common suggestion, I do plan to try that.

Now that you can get keys for CoM, getting a reaver got a lot easier
(albeit more crowded). We can duo Rak easily (shaman/sk) so reavers
are trivial.

Nah, no illusions of ever getting earthcaller. I know rangers that
spent months in Hate looking for the drop. It just isn't worth the
hassle.
