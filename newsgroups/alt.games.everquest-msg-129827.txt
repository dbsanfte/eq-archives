Judy,

 That is a warm story, and I truely appreciate you sharing that with us.
Where did your friend learn software programing?  This is a great
success story, and does indeed indicate that *all* Pali's are not bad.
In your story telling, I wonder if the whole problem came up, and
if you happened to "draw" on it with him from a relaxed, high level.
It was noble what he did, and what he was enduring in Israel, but
not that it matters, but just curious, do you think he and his family
would entertain ideas of comeing over to the States? Actually, in a 
way, it does matter.  I realize that NO one would "want" to leave
thier homelamd beause things are in a state of dissarray, but I
wonder if this fellow valued prosparity and personal advancement
more than the fate of his nation/land.

If we were to see/hear more stories like this, I think maybe more
Pali's might also be inclined to consider this path, and maybe with
a little luck, it would snowball. And the world would see a "different"
Palentinian, and hence a different image.  There's always hope.

Thanks for the story.
