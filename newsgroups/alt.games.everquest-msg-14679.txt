A higher level cleric or wizard, yes. But I have found (having played almost
every class in the game at some point) that you WILL have trouble keeping your
skills maxed to at least level 10 because most classes simply level too fast. And
when you have only a tiny bit of mana to spare, practicing with the low level
spells can be a blessing.
