Hi all.

I bought a sheetmetal ulak last night 
( http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16358 ) and I was 
wondering... How do the new bane/poison/whatever damage bonuses work? A 
10/20 with Poison Dmg: 2... Is the poison damage added to the damage of the 
weapon, added to the hit (after calculations) or added like a damagbe 
bonus? Does it add everytime or is there a save or some random effect that 
occurs?
