You can add monks to that list too, we actually had to switch tanks in
a recent LDoN group because the Warrior couldn't dependably hold agro
over our monk. Pally became the MT and warrior our primary off tank
where grabbing agro didn't matter as much. Admittedly it was a pretty
extreme example since the monk is relatively uber and had about 60AAs
on the warrior but our choice was to have the monk use a worse weapon
or just have the pally as MT.
