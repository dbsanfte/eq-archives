From various comments I've gotten it looks to me like the DAoC designers belong
to the "casters are gimps" school of game design.  One friend has told me she
has a lot of trouble soloing her caster in DAoC.

How the spellcasters work is pretty important to my reaction to a game.  I
liked almost everything about AC better than EQ, but the ultra-lame magic
system drove me away.
