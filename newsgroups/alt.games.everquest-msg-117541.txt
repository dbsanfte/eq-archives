Then something is very wrong or you are imagining things.

Grr damb my brain. One aa is either equivilent to 50 to 51 or 51 to 52.

This means that if you have just dinged 60 and you put AA:XP to 50:50
You will either get 2.2 or 5.2 AA points by the time you fill 60.
(Depending on if it is 50-51 or 51-52)

Either way AA should go up twice as fast.
