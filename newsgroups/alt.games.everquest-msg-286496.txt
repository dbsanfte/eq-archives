	I actually don't care if they're down.  I'd like to know
that they're going to be down, so, for instance, I don't get up
2 hours early to finish a quest before work and find out I have to camp
in a safe spot.

	There's no reason not to put 24 hours notice in the MOTD.  Even
if nice people on Usenet send me urls to otherwise-useless websites that
contain the network status information I expect to see in the page 
prominently marked network status...  It's sort of like if I went to
Home Depot and walked over to the plumbing section but all that was on the
shelf was a broken light bulb because I'm expected to know that to find
the plumbing section I need to go to the men's room and read the writing
on the third stall from the left.
