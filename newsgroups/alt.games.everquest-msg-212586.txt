So what, if I come to beleive every decision I make was predetermined 
millenia ago it rather sucks the joie de vivre out of it.

An object lesson for who? The people around me can't change. Their 
courses of actions were likewise carved in stone.

Showing a moving billiard ball its about to fall into a pocket doesn't 
help the billiar ball avoid falling into the pocket. Its on a 
predetermined course, with no ability to change anything based on an 
'object lesson' or anything else.

True. But we've already established that I don't have a choice. Merely 
the illusion of choice, at best. Why torment someone with the illusion 
of choice with object lessons demonstrating how he should change his 
behaviour if he could...
