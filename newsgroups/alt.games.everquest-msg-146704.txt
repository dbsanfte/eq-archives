I would like to help you, but right now I am levelling two characters in
that level range and I don't want my favorite zones over-run :)

But if the info is just for you and you aren't going to publish it *wink*
then try Dawnshroud.  Exp. is not as good as Paludal, but then again there
are NO zones at ANY level range that compare to the exp of that zone.

Dawnshroud can take you from 30 all the way to 50+ because there are a
number of camps with MOBs of different difficulty levels.  I would suggest
staying close to the Netherbian zone and getting in Zelniak/Wolf groups
there (watch out for trains), or going to the Santus Seru zone line to fight
Lightcrawlers.
