Because you're still very attractive to groups.

Even leaving aside the many other things you add to a group
(regen, DS, healing, nukes/DoTs, snares, etc.), and focusing just
on the port ability you claim you've "lost" as a valuable group
contribution, the fact remains that Druids will still be wanted
for evacs (dungeons still don't have convenient "this way to the
egress" buttons every 40 feet, last time I checked) and ports closer
to the fighting area than the cities which the PoK serves (Druid
rings are "out in the field" close to the dungeons, the cities
are not).

Nothing has changed, really, other than the pure "taxi service"
function which most Druids found more of a pain than not.

Don't get melodramatic, it's coming THIS WEEK, as per Rich, the
SOE spell guy.

I'll bet you 10,000 plat it's not.

Nor should it.

Funny, I've never seen this happen to a Druid.  Ever.

If it happens to you regularly, maybe it's because you don't know
how to properly play your class other than smacking the port key.

Given that you don't seem to know that Druids have a lot to offer
a group other than ports, this seems likely.
