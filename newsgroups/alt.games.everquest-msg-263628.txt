Yesterday after returning from Freeport to the Plane of Knowledge (together with a friend, I was in
follow mode) I could only advance in an extremely slow pace. I have logged out and back on the
server (Morden Rasp), exited EverQuest and restarted and even rebooted my pc. The GM couldn't help
either and he referred me to tech support.

My character is not encumbered and not in duck mode. When using Ctrl-R (still the active key for
run/walk) I see the appropriate button on the Actions window change to 'Walk' and 'Run' back and
forth while my dwarf rogue maintains his slow and steady pace. When I checked my other character on
the server I found that that one can still run as never before.

thanks,
Martin
