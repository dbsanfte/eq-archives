This part is just great to read.
"For a few months, one type of "Star Wars" character, the rare and 
powerful Jedi, could be permanently killed. But when players began 
singling out Jedi characters for vicious attacks, Jedi players cried out 
for help, and last month LucasArts abandoned permadeath, a company 
spokeswoman said."

Back during the middle of Beta 3 for SWG, I wrote a rather exhaustive 
paper in the beta forums about that very subject. It included my own 
predictions for the future of the game after release, how I saw it 
developing, and some problems that would be encountered. One of them was 
that their Vision regarding Jedi was totally screwed. I predicted that 
once Jedi started being unlocked in the game, very soon there would only 
be a few of them and they would be in the hands of only the most very 
powerful Player Associations (think "guilds" in EQ terms).  And that 
they would never even log into the game unless it was in a safe, guild 
held area with a large number of guildmates already there and guarding 
the spot. And when they went into battle, there would be platoons of 
troops from their PA who's sole job would be to decimate anyone who got 
near the Jedi.

Looks like I wasn't far off.
