From guides I read, it seems like your better off at least until higher
skill of skilling up on non-enchanted jewelery, as the enchanted stuff
at low skill isn't in that much demand and the sell back price is
basically the same.   Generally you will want to be making items with
the lowest cost and trivial level that will still allow for increases. 
The closer to a trivial level you are, it's generally considered a
greater chance for an increase in skill as well as in making the item. 
You will want to balance item cost/trivial levels. Watch what it costs
you, and as you go, if the bar/gem combination is more expensive than
the next bar up and malachite, switch to that.  ie. when silver and jade
trivial, it's cheaper (failure wise, etc) to switch to electrum
malachite than it is to make silver and pearl items.  

If you can get some items to raise your intelligence more as well as
buffs from a fellow enchanter to raise your intelligence (is this
brilliance?  I quit my enchanter fairly young), you will improve your
chances of a skill up.
