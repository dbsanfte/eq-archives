Sadly, she was only a ranger.  That's right, our only healer was a 
ranger.

Even worse, she disbanded without a word about fifteen minutes after she 
started pulling.  She didn't say anything to any of us, and after a 
bunch of "wtf?"s and looking around to see no sign of her, we shouted 
out for another healer and actually got a cleric.  No big loss, in other 
words *g*

lol!  Let him melee on his own next time, and then, just as he falls to 
the ground, step in and ask "need some help?"

(and ding 20 on my DE rogue, yay for a last name I haven't even bothered
