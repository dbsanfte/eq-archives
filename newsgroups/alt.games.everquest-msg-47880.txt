How does the /pause command work in with other commands on the same line?
Also I noticed that when using /pause 150 instead of 15 seconds it took
about 20 seconds, while /pause 200 took 25 seconds, but /pause 100 only took
the normal 10 seconds. Any idea why that happened? Also here is what I've
tried and the results I got.

/pause 100,/pause 100

Paused for 10 seconds (the second part was ignored).

/pause 100, /pause 100

Same here.

/pause 100 /pause 100

Didn't try this today, but I don't think its ever worked either.

/pause 50 /command

Result would be that the pause would be seen, but nothing after, same with
other way around, command is done but pause is ignored.

Anybody have more info on how this works?
