Hey, Half-Elf Bard, level 30 here!

>Do Bards get more exciting (was a great class for the first 15 or so lvl's)

You're about to hit what looks like "the sweet spot" for bards. From 20-30,
bards get a host of new abilities that radically change how they can hunt:
targetted slow+snare, group damage shield, ae fear, mez, charm, and targetted
dot. You'll soon be fear kiting mammoths in everfrost, bug zapping the
needlites in echo caverns, swarm kiting, chant kiting, and doing crowd
control.

Hey, at least go check out the aviaks in Lake Rathetear. There's a Soulbinder
in Arena next door. The 2-spawn right outside the zone line, or the 3-spawn
at the diving board, or even both camps are bard-soloable with little
downtime.  And at least you'll be getting xp with your loot. It's rarely
camped, but if there's someone already there, you can team up and camp the
gnolls at the SK zone line.


>Any other good zones that give XP about that may be more populous?
>I've only got the PoP expansion....

South Karana has The aviak tree (aka "KFC"), centaurs, the hermit, and
gnoll spires. There's generally a few folks there. SK will last you easily
into your high 20's if you want. South Karana, like Lake Rathetear, is
another zone where you can solo or group as you like.

Highhold orcs will last you 1 or 2 more levels, tops. After that, try
looking in on the Highhold basement. The downsides to HH is that you'll
need a group for orcs or the basement. If there's no one else camping orcs,
you're screwed because they tend to pop in groups of 3-6.  The basement
tends to be crowded, with a waiting list.  If you don't mind waiting a
while, you can often find a group in under an hour. And while you're
waiting, there's... well, there's really nothing else to do. But the xp
can be *really* great.

The closest PoP books are in Rivervale for HHK, and Feerrott or Qeynos for
SK and LR.


<www.eqdiva.com> has a decent hunting guide that's bard-specific, and often
tells what tactics will be helpful. You should check that out too.

And remember, getting groups together is as much about finding a group to
invite you, as it is inviting other people to hunt with you. You're a bard.
You can do (almost) anything. The next time you see someone "/ooc lfg" in
your level range, invite them to group with you. Between the two of you
there's bound to be some nice synergy between your class abilities and the
other guy's.
