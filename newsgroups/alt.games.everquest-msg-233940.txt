Hey

Safe fall maxes at 94 (or so) I ran around N Ro a lot and that is a
good place. I suggest to all rogues, max out 1hs and 1hb, throw things
(throwing) and keep archery up.

You will be pleased when you level and a 1hb drops. My method is to
use the weapon until my skill maxes and then move to the next.

For archery and throwing you can play ranger. Get a SoW and kite
around some cacti on OT or skellies, anything that is slow. Pepper
them with arrows or daggers til you run out. You will be pleased to
know you crit with throwing stuff, for silly amouts of damage (18),
but you can sneak pull.

Keep working it, find wepons that have low speed and it will skill in
so time.
