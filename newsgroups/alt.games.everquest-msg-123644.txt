Cure Disease removes 1 disease counter; Counteract Disease removes
8 disease counters;  Abolish Disease removes 36.  As examples,
Rabies adds X disease counters; Spreading Crud adds 3 disease
counters; Scarab Storm adds 10 disease counters.  Drowsy adds 3
disease counters;  Turgur's Insects adds 10 disease counters. And
so on and so on...

I haven't bothered to check this out, but I also believe all the
different disease counters go in different slots (assuming they're
stackable.)  So if a shaman-type mob slows you and then DoTs you
(with a disease-based DoT), you would remove the DoT (and some
of the Slow counters, most likely) and then the Slow.  (It should
work that way because the DoT counters are in a higher slot.  I'm
not sure it works that way, though.)
