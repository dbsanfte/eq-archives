8 slots is something verant says will never change (yeah, they said
other stuff would never change also) and the difference between other
never change things is that many players think 8 slots is plenty. Yeah
sometimes my druid is lazy assed and she'd like to be able to mem her
skin spell and personal thorn also so she doesn't have to stop and
remem when they run out, but by and large in regular play at level 55
I never feel that I need more slots. Verant knows that 8 is all you
really need for normal play and its true. 

I have two spells I stop and mem to rebuff myself every hour or so
then put back the old spell (usually improved superior camo) back in
the spot, its not a big deal. Clerics are the one class that might
really have an easier time with even 2 more slots (because they have
so many varied circumstance heals) but they sure seem to do fine as it
is. 

It kind of gets to the point where signing the "petition" for such
things in EQ would be like signing a petition for our country to
switch to communism. Verant changes stuff when they want to where they
see a problem and they don't see a problem in this. Its not something
LACKING in the game but rather something players are lazy about that
they think would be "nice." I'd far rather have them fix the things
which are LACKING such as velious graphics not being on Luclin models
even though that was one of my major reasons for purchasing velious. I
mean otherwise they should stamp on all new velious boxes "New armor
textures, Oh unless you "upgraded" to Luclin then you don't get them!"
(I can't even remember now if it mentions the velious armor on the
velious box though now)
