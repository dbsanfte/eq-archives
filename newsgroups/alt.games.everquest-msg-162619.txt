Isn't that also a theory of the Tower of Frozen Shadows? It got blown
there by the blast and landed in Velious because it didn't have enough
escape velocity.

Of course we don't want to speculate how many kitties had been smushed
into paste on take-off/landing, and why there are no Erudites on the
moon as well. Maybe the Vah Shir had a big Erudite bar-b-que.
