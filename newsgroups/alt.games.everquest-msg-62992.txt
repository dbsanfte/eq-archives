Have seen this happen ONE time involving a corpse. Grouped with a level 
52 cleric who died, and when he came back, he started to loot corpse and 
forgot to rez himself, so he did a /q while he was still in the loot 
corpse screen but had all the loot in him.

When he came back, he was so lucky that the server had not remembered 
that he looted the last backpack, so he could rez himself.

But only seen this happen once.
