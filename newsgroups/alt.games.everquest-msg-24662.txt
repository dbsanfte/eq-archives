Well, the time has come.

I have finally realized I am not having fun playing EQ anymore. I am not
sure if it was the huge number of beggars or 733+ d00dz, or the fact that I
got tired of the "Kill critter, loot, repeat" cycle. So after 2+ years, I am
hanging it up.

But I have some pretty decent gear on a couple of characters, and it would
be a shame to just delete the account, without sharing the wealth. And since
selling accounts is a no-no, I will be giving away items in Kelethin. I will
be there around 5:00 PM, CST. Minor weapons and armor as well as jewelry
will be freely passed out, but the better items like a FBSS, etc., will be
awarded to players that can answer trivia questions. These questions will
not all be game-related... here is an example:

Where does the quote "Another mouth to feed is another mouth to feed!" come
from?

Anyhow, it was a long, interesting trip, but the time has come to move on.
Thanks to the folks that were cool, and made the game fun. And to those that
didn't... don't bother to ask for gear. In fact, if you are a moron with a
less than intelligent name... spare yourself some ridicule. Don't even hint
that you want the SSoY.
