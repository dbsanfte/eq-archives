Well.. I'm sure you were going to the correct place.. or atleast if you were
to enter something like  http://everquest.com   it -should- work... but,
then I checked out EQ Traders and found their DNS records (as well as your
own DNS as we both found from the post/reply after this) are messed up as
well, IMO.

If I go into a browser it is accessining by default, port 80.  A local DNS
should see this and say, "Oh port 80.  He wants the website, here ya go big
guy."  Though, EQ Traders DNS isn't doing that oddly enough.

Then of course there is the fact that your own DNS (well, the one you use
that is) is also messed up.  Call your ISP and tell them its hosed, not
caching (probably not setup as cache only anyway) properly and most
importantly is not resolving IP addresses.

If you have any other difficulties with any other websites and before they
get you situated, you're only real choice is to find out the FQDN's
associated IP address by doing a ping/tracert on that FQDN (ie.
eqtraders.com).

Pain in the butt... though, thats why they have DNS servers (-when they
work-). ;p
