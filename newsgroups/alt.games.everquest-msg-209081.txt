Bristlebane's Guildless is my favourite atm.

There is a new guild on BB called something like Cenie's Minion (not 100% on
character name, it wasn't that memorable but it is the name of the Guild
leader) I certainly wouldn't want a guild tag that described me as an
underling to another player. Of course, minion could also mean something
like beloved or chosen but that it is not the first thing I think of when I
see the word.
