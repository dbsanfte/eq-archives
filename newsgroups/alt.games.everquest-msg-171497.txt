You are very very right. Anyone who isn't seeing this must have
blinders on. Even my own enchanter throws caution to the wind and goes
soloing when I run across a free KEI (I don't buy them). How many
groups could have used me during that time, I wonder? And on test my
warrior sees almost no casters grouping at all. Why bother when they
have virtually unlimited mana regen?
