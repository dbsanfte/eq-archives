Yes you can transfer characters from one account to another, just be
prepared to pay for the privilege.

What items are transferred? Nothing, you go naked, no items, nothing in the
bank. Up to you if you think it's worth it. Oh and Verant say that you
should not transfer items to another character before a move, they take a
dim view of that and it may jeopardise your account.
