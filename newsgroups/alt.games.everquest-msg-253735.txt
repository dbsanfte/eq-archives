This equal to or better agro than a Knight is patently false.  Any Knight
worth his salt can, at will, yoink agro from any War no matter how well
equiped that warrior is.  War's are still very much a one trick pony, i.e.
/def on ubermobs, and even that recently has seen a vile bit of nerfage.

In some of the GoD trials there are at least now two mobs, Kyv Heastriker Jiro
and something else that check once per tick if the player they are smacking on
is using defensive or some other form of dmg mitigation.  If KHJ makes that
check he then emotes something about not wasting his time and goes off and 
obliterates #2 on the hatelist.  Wheeee, what fun.
