Hey, my 8088 ran PC DOS, not MS.  And, it had an EGA monitor.  Of course, it
was alot easier to reinstall your OS... just open the A: Drive, remove
floppy, install good floppy, close A: Drive, hit Ctrl-Alt-Del (no dialog
boxes, it just did a soft reboot).

That and a chip extractor if you didn't want to bend the pins.  Then they
came out with the new-fangled SIMMs chips.  What will they think on next?
