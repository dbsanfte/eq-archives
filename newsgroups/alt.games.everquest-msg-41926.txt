 Okay dimwits let's wrap up the shitty dog analogy. The terrorists aren't
the fucking dogs, the countries that harbor them are. The terrorists are
like the rabies virus. In every rabid dog that was ever to be dispatched
from the plane of the living you can be sure it's heart was saying something
like, "hey what the fuck man, don't shoot me it's not my fault this goddamn
virus thing is living here. Go shoot the teeth out, but leave me alone." But
you know what? We kill the WHOLE fucking dog because sometimes it's just too
hard to separate the parts. I hope I cleared up some of the finer points of
life for the duller readers.
