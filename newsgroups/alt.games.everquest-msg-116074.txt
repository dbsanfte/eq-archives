<SNIPPED EVIDENCE>

Sure it has, in me and you. You can probably point to the post you
made as evidence to your Father that EQ has actually been a coping
mechanism to you. I mean by that, in a crappy situation, you have a
way to channel your energy into a social game, where you learn to
interact with people, and get a whiff of Capitialism.

In posts I see from you here, I see often that you think thinks out,
and use your head. EQ has affected us all, some think it for bad, but
in reality often for the better.

This is coming from someone who is twice your, ummmm, "weight" lets
say. It has affected me too, for the better I like to think. Perhaps
it is pure escapism, or maybe it's just inteacting with people.

I am often told at Church by people that it is a danger to my faith,
however, I find that exercising simple courtesy, and the ability to
try new ways to help me cooperate has helped me in my own search for
God. In this time, in the Catholic Church, we are under incredible
spiritual and secular stress, and believe it or not, EQ has helped me
cope with it.
