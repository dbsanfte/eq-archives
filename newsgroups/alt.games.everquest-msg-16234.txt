Ya, neither my pacbell nor elink servers have it up at this point.  They
both are slow to add new groups I've found, too big for their own dang
good <g>.

Actually been following this one for some time now.  Lost a few friends
to early beta phases, despite the fact that we've all beta-ed together
over the years, honoring NDAs is a point of honor with us heh.  Premise
has potential, but what I am curious to see is customer feedback during
the opening weeks.  From reports I've gotten it is going to release in
pretty bad shape, hopefully they survive the initial months and get the
money to finish it, but rather than buy now I am planning on following
the NGs for a bit and seeing what sort of progress they make on their
issues.  Thanks for the info on where the NG is even if I can't see it,
guess I'll have to go the archive route.
