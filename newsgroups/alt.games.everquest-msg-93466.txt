Actually, this is not really true.  The most recent study I read 
www.nickyee.com/eqt/home.html indicates that slightly less than 1/2 the 
female main characters are played by men.  (84% of EQ players are male, 
and of those about 15.7% of the men play female characters as their main.  
Just about 2% of females play male characters as their main.)  
Also, females are significantly more likely to be guildleaders than men, 
statistically.  I personally feel that this is due to the generally higher 
value that females place on socialization and community, though I have no 
proof of this.
I do know that one of the reasons my guild is so successful is that we 
have very effective officers.  Three of them happen to be women, and while 
their playstyles differ, they present a clarity of vision that the male 
officers don't possess.  The other officers may offer a stronger 
short-term focus, but for long range planning the breast brigade runs the 
show.
