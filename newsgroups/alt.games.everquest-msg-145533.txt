Yes, 50+.  Some of the rogues' best features don't come about until
after 50, and I'd dare say after 55 (or 59...duelist r0xx0rs ;-)  ).  Not
much
different pre-50 in a ranger and a rogue, although the ranger brings
some utility spells as well.  The rogue can hide through a party wipeout
if he's not on the hate list.  Same for wizards, though...pre-50 they have
a hard time finding a group, although not as hard as it was pre-wizzy-
snare.  Both classes are damage monsters, but that's actually a pretty
narrow specialization to focus on for 50 levels.

The 50+ game for rogues is the reward for sticking it out that long.  As
a bonus, since you HAVE to group as a rogue (and lots are pickup groups),
you end up getting known on the server and getting invited to all sorts
of things...like being the only level 48 on a Trak raid because your
friends'
mostly 55+ guild is smacking him down that night and you happen to be
on.  It happens more from friendship and being known as a fun-person
than from "I'm level 20 with a Fungi and Jade Maces...I p0wn Oasis!!!"

That's been my biggest beef with the rogue class since day one (ok, maybe
like
day 30...my first time through, day one was spent not getting out much past
the huts in Misty Thicket..."wall, what wall? HOLY SHIT! That guy's dagger
was 6/23 and was +to DEX!!!"

VI screwed up the implementation of the rogue class.  Pre-kunark, it
was possible to know by name/sight all 10 of the other 40+ rogues on
a server.  There were SERIOUS problems, but even during that time
many rogues just wanted to be a little more roguish...with quests that
invovled picking locks or traps, and pickpocketing meanies (or good
guys, for that matter).  Evade and sneak/hide went a LONG way
towards making the class playable by the masses instead of the weirdoes
(<----me), and while the rogue anti-twink bias STILL has some adherants
(ask Ryou what I think about her rogue making it to 35 as a non-twink.
Seriously, ask her.), lots of mid-range and end-game content is easier
with a rogue assassinating the lawn trash to get to the good stuff (unless
the lawn trash is red to a level 60, at which point the rogue cries for
a defensive warrior while he hides).

VI screwed up the implementation of the rogue class, mainly putting it
in EQ because, well, RPG's always have rogues or scouts.  Living up to
folklore, novels, and pen/paper RPG's would be tough, though, simply
because with a poison skill of 250 I should be the BEST FUCKING SOLO
PLAYER EVER.  I mean, I can create poisons out of goblin poop.  That
should be an instant 32k for any mob.  Rogues are supposed to be
lone wolves, not constantly in need of protection.  I don't want to just
sneak past those dogs in Chardok...I want to poison some meat and
have them die choking before I saunter past.  I want to sneak through
the Queen's protection and backstab her with Inferno Blood, watching her
burn up from the inside as I loot her.  Then sneak back out through the
turmoil and kick back some beer in Rivervale (where the only good beer
is made...dwarven beer suxxors ;-)  ).

Lendel Deeppockets is God.

Well, simply because some of the folks with real exposure to rogues
who have stayed going with the class DO see how they're useful at
higher levels.  Meemers probably hasn't seen Unrest in 3 years...

I agree.  I think that many of the key-only locks SHOULD be pickable.
Either fight through ToFS and get all the keys, or bring a rogue (or two)
along.  Open up that door in Highkeep and chat with a skeleton.  Panty
raid on Mistmoore!!!

If the rogues can't stick it out through their 30s, I'm glad.  It's sort of
like
a cleric in Ssra bitching because he wants to melee some.  As you
level with every class, your role becomes more sharply defined. If you
want to take on AoW with 40 warriors for melee, go ahead.  I bet 2 warriors
and 20 monks/rogues would do a faster job, though...
