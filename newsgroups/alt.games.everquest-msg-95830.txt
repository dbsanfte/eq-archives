Meanwhile, for those who passed Reading Comprehension 101:
dragging the gem icon to the hotkey bank just makes it bigger
so it's easier to click on it.  In raid situations lag can be a very
big factor and it's easier to "find" the bigger icon.

A druid, for instance, may have a full, normal hotkey bank for
buffing and/or while the raid fights their way into an encounter.
Once the target mob is going to be pulled, however, the ONLY
spell they might cast is their best heal.   No one cares to hear
that a druid is spot healing;  they want to hear the cleric CHeal
rotation.  So that druid might have a hotkey bank of just a
/target tank_name hotkey for each of the main tanks in the
rotation, an /assist hotkey for assist healing, and a gem icon
hotkey of their best heal so it's easier to click on it.

The equipment hotkeys are, generally, for warriors who can't
cast themselves or for zero casting time items that help delay
getting debuffed by some mobs, at least from raid screenshots.
It's fairly common to hotkey some equipment for many people
for everyday use as well, like the mana-free DoT and Snare on
Kunark druid armor.
