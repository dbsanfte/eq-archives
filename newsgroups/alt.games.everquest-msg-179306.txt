Not me - I've got my leather padding at a reasonable 20pp.

It's just that I sold spiderling silks at 5pp each along with a couple of
other guys.  Next thing I know, there's 30 people selling silks and the
price dropped to around 1p 5g.  Next, iron oxides off of Stonegrabbers -
sold a handful at 200pp each.  Then everyone else shows up - price is now
down to 75pp and I can't unload 'em.

I'm just crabby.  As I leveled from 30 to 35, the ability to get a couple
1,000 plat from the bazaar got *very* addicting.  Now, it just ain't
possible anymore...
