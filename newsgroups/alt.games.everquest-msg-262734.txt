True, the benefits remain, but the meaning is removed.

Say, for $50 you could equip your character in every slot with Time
level equipment. Then for another $50 you could instantly move your
character to level 70.

***

Now you are level 70 with the best equipment in the game.

Q: What do you do now?

A: Kill things and take their stuff.

Q: Why?

A: Because I can. With all this cool equipment and levels, I can kill
anything.

Q: To what end?

A: To get better stuff.

Q: Don't you already have the best stuff?

A: ... Yeah, I guess I do.

Q: Now that you have the best stuff, what do you want to do?

A: I guess I can go brag about how good my stuff is and how powerful
my character is. I mean look at my hit points, I've got over 10K!

Q: Yeah, but doesnï¿½t every snot-nosed little punk with his mom's
credit card already have the best stuff and the most powerful
character?

A: ... Well yeah, I guess...

Q: Okay, so what now?

A: I guess I can just cancel my account, but first I gotta' get my
fucking money back.

***

You might say that there is more to EQ (and really any MMORPG) than
killing things and taking their stuff, so that you can get better
stuff later, but if there is, it is provided by the players, with very
little encouragement from the game itself. If all you were interested
was the player provided aspect, you can get that from any of the
hundreds (literally) of free RP chat rooms around the net.

In all honesty, to put people like IGE out of business (if only to
remove my own temptation, if nothing else) I'd be willing to accept
SoE sold items, but only if they were NO DROP, NO RENT, and were
clearly identified with flaming "Loser" particles flying off of them
while equipped. =P
