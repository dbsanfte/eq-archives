It is *NOT* a damage shield.I got the level 61 version,it "procs"(dont
know how to say it better) randomly for 405 damage,uses SCF AAs,
is self only(unlike the Shaman version),and the Cleric needs to tank.
So what does this all mean in everyday solo xping(most groups wont
accept the Cleric maintanking I think :)  )?
I tested it on undead mobs at entrance of Chardok B,which are around
level 55 to 58.In an average fight it goes off 6 to 8 times,me
tanking,meleeing and chain nuking.So I get around 4k damage from
it for 500 mana;for me it means I could make some solo xp where I
could not before,I average 1 AA in 2h to 2 1/2h.
Depending on how often I get spell crits,I finish the fights with 20%
to 50% health,lowest was 3%(ouch),and loose about 25% mana.
My Cleric is level 65,89 AAs(SCF4 among them),has 5k hps buffed,
41% haste from Tribute,full Focus gear,FT 15 from items,I usually have
no Kei or other non-self buffs.

Problem with Cleric soloing is there are no undead mobs in the level
range I need close to a PoK book,run to Chardok B is annoying,it 
would be nice if there was a spot,which I could reach in a reasonable
time to get some xp while looking for group.
