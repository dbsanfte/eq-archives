Your position would have certain merit if the guy had apologized *before* 
being caught. If he had started off with "Er, Red... remember that 
incident at blah blah? I'm really sorry about that, I was a bit of an 
asshole then, but we were desperate", there *may* be an argument for not 
deguilding his sorry ass on the spot. As it is, Bob would have failed in 
his duty as an officer if he hadn't acted like he did (providing, of 
course, his guild's charter has a "no assholes" clause).
