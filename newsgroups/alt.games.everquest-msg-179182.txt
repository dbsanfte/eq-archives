Two Things.
1. I am way past caring what the GMs are sick and tired of. As the a
customer I am sick and tired of complete SHIT service. I have NEVER
had an issue resolved with this company, that goes for the "tech
support" personell also. They are bigger joke than the GM's. At least
with GM's your have a CHANCE (albeit small)of a response.
2. My question was not: Can a snippish prick explain to me SOE's
policy regarding /petition. kthxbye.

The rest of the posts helped tremendously. Thanks all.
