corporations own no money. Every bit of that money is owned by someone else.
I,E, it is impossible for any corporation to spend money doing anything .
All money comes from the hand of an individual, If a corporation made a
donation then what really happened is that the owners of the corporation all
chipped in a bit for a cause they believed in.

Legitimate private concerns certainly do have enough money to be heard. For
instance the national education association is widely regarded as the most
influential of the lobby groups . There one and only goal is to make life
easier and better for teachers. This goal is pretty much in opposition of
the goal of educating students but hey they certainly get there agenda heard
and responded to.

Lobbies always are groups of people who are joining together so that when
they speak they have enough noise to be heard. They are nothing else and
when anyone tries to tell you about the evil lobbies what they are really
saying is we want to keep our neighbors from talking cause we REALLY dont
like what they are saying.
