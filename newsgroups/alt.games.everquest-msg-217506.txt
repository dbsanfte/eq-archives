Whats next? I figure a hotkey that puts soulbinders and merchants on 
'call' so you just press your hotkey, they popup, bind you, sell 
whatever you need, etc. Minimizes the amount of time you waste on 
travelling, and locating merchants, etc.

Its extremely hard to balance the need for mindless tedium to preserve 
realism and immersiveness and doing away with mindless tedium precisely 
because its mindless and tedious.

As much as I hated the boats, I liked hating the boats. Now that I don't 
have to take them, I actually miss them. Going to Velious used to be a 
real trip...now its 15 seconds from Freeport (not that anyone ever goes 
to freeport anymore... so 5 seconds from pok)

As annoying as travel time was, there was something about being a 'long 
way from home' that has long since been lost between faction irrelevance 
with luclin, and pok books with pop.
