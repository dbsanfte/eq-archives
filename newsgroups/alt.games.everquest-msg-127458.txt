I'm sorry.  Is that considered to be an accomplishment?  It's not like its all that
hard to do or anything.  I do agree with you that consistent follow-up is a nice
touch, though.  I also like that he's implying that he's getting more offers from his
antics here.  I somehow doubt if many people are rushing out to buy the game + "free"
account because of his postings here.
