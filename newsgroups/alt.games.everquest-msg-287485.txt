Yes he would, have every legal right, because it's a breach of 
copyright.  What he would NOT get, would be any financial compensation. 
  The law is nice and clear, it's a breach, but has no value, and *that* 
is why most people don't follow it up.

Here's the thing - if you want to do it, just ask.  If you ask, and they 
say yes, then you're golden, if you don't ask you're stealing.  If you 
respect an artist, you'll ask.  If you respect their work, you'll ask. 
If you believe that artists have a right to own their own creations and 
to be in control of how they are copied, then you'll ask.

If I loved an author enough to want to do what you suggest, then it 
wouldn't take me 5 minutes to find out how to contact them and just ask.
