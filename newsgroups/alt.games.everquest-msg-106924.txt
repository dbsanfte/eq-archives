My lvl29 (almost 30) druid:

BCP chest
Gator legs
Ulthork arms
RMBs
CGS secondary
Spirit Tome/EBM primary
Othmir cap/Leatherfoot Raider cap
+3 wis earrings
+7 wis rings
BIM neck (crappy I know)
+8 wis/str face
Karana anklet feet
Belt of River
Spore cloak (another crappy item, looking for Mammy Cloak)
Splitpaw gloves
Braided Ivy Cords shoulders

I think that comes out to be around 187 +WIS.  Got gloves, belt, cloak,
anklet, LFR cap on my own....bought the rest.

Lukkas Thistlefoot of Povar
lvl29 Halfling Druid of Karana
