Well my catman bard guy just hit 40.   I've been soloing for the passed 5
levels in eastern wastes and iceclad, awesome areas.  Anyhow,  for those
last 5 levels I didn't swing a sword once and I am curious.  As bards
progress in levels are required less and less to melee and rather just twist
their songs?  I don't plan on going nuts between ticks and swapping out
instrument for weapons, it can be tricky enough just swapping out
instruments for the added bonus for the songs in my line up.  Of course this
applies more to outdoor zones....

Bards 40> , what percentage of the time do you just play instruments?
