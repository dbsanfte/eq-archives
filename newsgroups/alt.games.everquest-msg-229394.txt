I'm surprised that anyone here finds this surprising. Seriously, you've
described my experience with every mmog chat room I've visited since UO. I
think the SWG chat rooms were probably the worst of the bunch (although I
suspect that's because they have so much more to bitch about ... ;-)

It's a pretty predictable experience and those of you who've been in betas
of mmogs know the drill. Lot of bitching and moaning about the servers being
down, followed by canned, uniform replies that "Hey, it's beta", with an
escalating exchange of insults and STFUs, ad nauseum. Then the product is
released and the "It's beta" excuse no longer works, so the whiners gain a
sort of moral ground that they pound into everyone's head with threats of
lawsuits and other fun stuff. Of course, the people playing the game rarely
stop into chat, so you wind up with an audience that's almost exclusively
people who have a problem and no recourse. My guess is that you're only
hearing whines from a pretty small percentage of them, but they sure make up
for it in volume.

Aye, it's embarassing, and maybe more so for EQ folks than a lot of other
games. Can you imagine what it must be like in the FF chat rooms, or what
it's going to be like in the WoW chat rooms?
