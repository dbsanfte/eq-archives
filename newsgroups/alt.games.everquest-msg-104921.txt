    They are for the twinks that already have the items. That's the real
issue. I don't mind so much when new stuff is added with anti-twink coding
on it, like the items in Cazic Thule. Nobody ever put those on a twink
without knowing they wouldn't work at full capacity. But there's a bunch of
people with Venomous Axes on twinks who likely bought them thinking they'd
work great, and now they don't. That'll get people a lot more upset then
twink-proofing a zone nobody's been in yet.

    Oh, totally agreed. The Fungi Tunic was a massive mistake. But the
question is, and I certainly don't have the answer to it: can you nerf
existing items to prevent twinking without pissing off people who traded for
those items believing they would continue to work as they have for some
months? If you do, will confidence in "the economy" (and indeed, the economy
itself) become broken?
