Paineel
Warrens
Stonebrunt Mountains
Jaggedpine forest
Tons of new items, spells, enhancements (you don't need the expansions
to use them....but getting them without the expansions is
tougher...they need to be imported)
New customizable UI (no expansions required)
Hybrid EXP penalty removed
Grouping EXP bonus
EQ in a Window (current imlementation sucks, but free to all)

That is just some of the things ALL players get for free, no
expansions required. So what is your argument again?

You can use all of the items and spells from the expansions in the old
world. (with the exception of post 50 spells/items...You can't level
past 50 without expansions). The only trick is getting the items
"imported" to the old world by players with the expansions.

Further almost NONE of the old world zones/encounters (with the
exception of Dragons and Planes) have been changed or made "harder".
You could make a point about the improved caster AI, but at the same
time you have to concede that player power (even Old World only
no-expansion players) has increased over the years as well.

I am sorry but there is no foundation for your argument.
