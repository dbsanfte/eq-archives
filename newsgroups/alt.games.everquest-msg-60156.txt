    Could be the "too little XP" thing: frequently, if the amount of XP one
person would get from a kill was deemed to be "too small", they'd get no XP
at all. I used to be able to demonstrate this with someone in a hell level
paired with someone one level lower (when XP was split by total % of XP in
the group) killing an XP green. The higher level person would get the XP
message, the lower one would not.
