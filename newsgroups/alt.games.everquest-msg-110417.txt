With 100(?) limit in skill, the hp / bandage ratio is pretty weak.
It's hard for me to imagine that the mana you lose by not medding (20
mana / tic  with maxed med skill at 60)  for the 6 seconds it takes
you to bandage would be offset by lich damage you healed.

That being said, I have first aid 3, and it's worth it just for the
looks on the melee-type faces when I bandage them past 50%. :-)

(I'm an enchanter btw)

If I were you, I'd go with regen before first aid, because you can med
and regen at the same time, but you can't med and bandage.
