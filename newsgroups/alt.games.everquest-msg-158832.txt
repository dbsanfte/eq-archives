Maybe you can help. I'm trying to list all the differences between these
two dragons and what they have in common. Maybe.... just *maybe* if I
can gather enough observations on them my pea sized brain will be able
to figure out this puzzle.

We've killed Feydedar more times than I can remember. The last time was
with seventeen people and only four of them melee.  We've now tried
Trakenon three times, the last with 42 raiders boasting no less then a
dozen level 60+ among them. Result? Three TPW's and three tedious CRs.
The guy who sells tiny coffins in the bazaar has given us a customer
appreciation award and sent us all next year's "Hot Elf Chicks at the
Beach" calendar. This last time we had Trak down to FIVE FOOKING PERCENT
when the last man went down. Talk about a heartbreak.

But they are both Kunark dragons! Why should they be so different? What
can we say to compare and contrast these two dragons?

HP: The same. 32K as best I know.

Color: Fay is sort of oarnge. Trak is kind of purplish black. Maybe it's
some sort of Fen Shui thing?

Size: Fay is tiny. Trak is humungous.

AoE: They both have one. Though Fay's is fire and Trak's is (?)poison?

Resistable? : Anecdotal evidence at best, but on the last few Faydedars
I've resisted every single AoE and not been feared once. With very
similar PR to FR, I've yet to resist a single AoE from Trak.

MR:  They seem equally susecptible to lures, in my experience. *shrug*

Aggro? :  Dunno. We've started just zerging the hell out of Trak, so
there's no knowing who's got aggro at any given time.

Anything else anyone has noticed about these two that could be added to
these observations?
