Anyone know if 1 stone will port a group or if each person must turn in a
stone to be ported?  If it's single only, then I would assume Wizards will
still be getting /tells for ports so that a group doesn't have to get a
bunch of stones from Neriak 3rd gate.  (I am assuming they aren't being sold
elsewhere yet).

I know that if I'm going to solo or meet a group that's there, this will be
a great feature.  If I have 4 of us that want to go, I'd rather only need 1
stone and bug a wizard to send the group all at once.
