Well, If you don't count The Hole, there is the cliff in Emerald Jungle;
Kurn's Tower; the Kael Drakkal entrance chasm, maybe the coastline in EW if
you do it right; jumping off an island in PoA (do you take damage for
that?); getting bugged right after a port and getting stuck inside a fellow
portee and stuck in midair until you move and then falling for 2k damage
(saw this happen to a friend); getting bugged and sucked up the mast of a
boat, then falling (same friend had this happen); skydiving in Kelethin, and
jumping down the well in Befallen.
