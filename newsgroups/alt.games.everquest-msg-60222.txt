There's a difference between not "taking the game that serious" and
"not caring". Yes, I do get upset when someone does something stupid
that will risk ruining the fun of others. Frankly, that's not taking
it "too seriously". If you think it's a bad thing to get upset when
someone ruins a game for other people, you are the one who has
problems here...

Yes, yes, when it is an honest accident, people shouldn't and often
don't get upset. When the train was intentional, THEN people have
every right to get upset.

By the way....grow an imagination and come up with an original last
name rather than ripping off TSR.
