   I can understand the inpulse to do that.  I
do the same thing, to a much lesser degree.
I tend to be a somewhat social player (yes, I
do generate my fair share of inane chatter,
though usually only about ingame issues). I
have a few friends and aquaintences.  Its nice
that they can usually recognize my various alts,
by the naming convention that I've picked.
Plus, for me, it's nice that my husnband can
always find me by doing a /who all tea.

           with George Foreman, though.
