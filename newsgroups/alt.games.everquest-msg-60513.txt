Illegible scrolls and cantrips can be turned in, but one of them has
to wait till your faction is high enough. My gnome mage is IIRC
indifferent, and is told to increase her reputation before turning in
scrolls. If they won't talk to you about cantrips, have someone invis
you before handing in. (Mind you, I might have scrolls and cantrips
backwards)
