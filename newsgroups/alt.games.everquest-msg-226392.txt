Hmmm... I ask for an explanation and I get a little tirade about how 
'stupid and close-minded' I must be. I see you've decided to go with 
innuendos about asses and IQs. Ironic.

Wow, thats just a little inspired gem of wisdom. Now your refuting my 
arugment, by avoiding it entirely and diving off on some tangent about 
it not being an important issue, with some allusions to my life being 
pathetic for even taking time to consider it. Well... hate to break it 
you but this whole NG and everything on-topic is thoroughly unimportant, 
from warriors being broken to the pants bug, and yet most people here 
are not pathetic.

> Oh, wait, no excuse to whine, either...

Give me a break. Like I need to dig into EQs beta policy to find 
something unsatisfactory in the world...
