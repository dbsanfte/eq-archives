So i suppose it is  for a person to be rude? Am i not allowed to come on
here and ask a question? maybe i missed the part on how to get to
veliuos...maybe i skimmed through it to fast...? see  i can tell what the
deal is..i guess because matt has been posting here longer than i ,then it
is ok for him to be rude to someone you guys are not familiar with..What if
it was me that answered someone the way he did? would i be ok with you guys?
I wonder if i would get the protection he gets? But like i said since he
felt it neccesary to be rude ,  I felt it was my part to be also too..YOU
SEE THE PROBLEM IS NOT ME ASKING.The problem is his rudeness..many of you
will not admit or it or dont care too..so like i said if you have to be rude
,then keep your mouth shut..then i woundnt have a reason to cuss him
out..that is what could have been avoided..I thought the boards were for
asking questions ,even if they are simple or complex?I can be a nice guy if
you are to me .but if you wanna act snotty,,then I can be a A... too..peace
