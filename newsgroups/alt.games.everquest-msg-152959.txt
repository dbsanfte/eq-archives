What about the large ubers that can have literally 30 members raid
the guy one day, 30 the next, 30 the next, and a MB wizard team to
finish him off while the first 30 gets re-allowed back into the zone?

My main's guild is 41 people.  I've seen some larger guilds that
have rosters of 100+, all level 59+.

It wouldn't be THAT difficult.
