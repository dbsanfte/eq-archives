She's already been killed on a couple of servers - one took well more than
an hour.  Lootless and almost instant respawn.  I don't know if they got any
xp from it, though I hope not.

There's also another spawn like her in the Warrens.  At the very source of
the river (haven't been there myself), there is a mob called Riversource.
