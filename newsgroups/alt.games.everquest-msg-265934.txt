Absolutely.

As with all things Mac or PC it typically works out as follows:

For the PC

you can buy utter shit, to mediocre, to adequate, to good quality, to 
high end quality, to the very bleeding edge of performance.

For the Mac

You can buy good quality or high end.

The very worst of the Macs typically end up being much better than the 
average PC you'll see, given the plethora of utter shit to adequate pc's 
being peddled into the budget market. But the very best PCs can exceed 
whats available for Mac.

That said... yeah... you can get a PC case that rivals or even exceeds a 
Mac one. But it won't be cheap.

They're works of art. :)

Sounds like a good case. Not a bad looker either. I find so many of 
Antec's cases look over-wrought plasticky. Sort of like a honda civic 
that's been done out to look as curvy as Porsche always falls short of 
the mark. The kitted up Civic has the curves... but the elegance just 
isn't there. Those thermaltake xasers for example, are just garish, but 
they aren't a bad case to work with.

One thing I don't like about your case is the door. In general I hate 
cases with doors and popopen panels. I use usb camera's, scanners, 
memory sticks, headsets and use the front ports extensively. I also have 
an audigy2 platinum with the "Live!Drive"... So the doors / panels 
always have to be open... so what's the flipping point. Plus they break 
off. :)

Lol. In an era where cases start at $9.00, paying 10x as much for a 'box 
to hold your bits' when it adds nothing to performance is a tough pill 
to swallow for the budget conscious :)

Exactly. Which ought to be a clue about the honesty of their claim. Mac 
users deserved a chance to play on a virgin server free even from the 
alt-rush of PC users. But there was no good reason to not let a guy with 
10 RL friends on Server X play on server X with them.

Aye. AFAIK they play together.
