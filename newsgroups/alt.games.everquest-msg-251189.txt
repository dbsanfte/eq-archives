Have you considered putting the computer in another room?  I've toyed with
that.  Basically, have in the room where you are just a monitor, mouse,
keyboard, speakers, and an optical drive.

The mouse, keyboard, and optical drive can be connected to the computer via
USB (or you can use Firewire for the optical drive).  You can get a fair
distance on USB for Firewire if you chain hubs.  Speaker cable can also run
great distances.

Or, for sound, use one of those external boxes that hooks up via USB.

The hard one is the monitor.  There are converters that can run DVI over
fiber but they are rather pricey (and so is the fiber cable).

There are also boxes that can run an analog video signal over CAT5 cable.
I've seen some that also can extend USB over the same CAT5 cable, and audio.
These are still pricey, but not as pricey as the DVI to fiber stuff, but I
think they might not be able to handle high resolution and refresh rates.
