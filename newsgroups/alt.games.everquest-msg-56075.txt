Well, from my attempt so far, you don't get casters.  So far this is what I
have played:

Lion Warrior, level 9, East Karana, Killed by a guard after attempting to
eat a blue farmer
Fire Beetle Warrior, Level 2, Toxxulia Forest, Killed by my fellow fire
beetles after turning on my own kind
Decaying Skeleton Warrior, Level 4, Toxxulia Forest, Killed by an adept
initiate(I think that's what it was)
Giant Scarab Warrior, level 9, Butcherblock Mountains, Honorably retired

I never ran into any low level players, I did have one red druid beam a
smile at my Giant Scarab after I hailed him.  I had just finished off a
player controlled Krag Chick that attempted to take me out.  He kept trying
to move behind me, unsuccessfully, and he was green to me.

When I got the fire beetle, I couldn't help but start laughing as I
remembered the diaries of a fire beetle posted here sometime back.

I did get xp with all of them, but not enough to level, from killing other
mobs.
