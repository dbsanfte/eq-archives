Um, excuse me?  Where exactly do I accuse the OP of that?

Ah, and you, of course, have been granted special knowledge of what
exactly is common and invariant across all 6.5 billion of us.  No
doubt revealed to you personally by the Lord God Almighty.  Wait,
don't tell me, I've got it!  You're Oral Roberts' evil twin "Skippy",
right?

lol
1) has it never occured to you that what's obvious in your private
little world might not actually exist in IRL?
2) if he didn't want comments on what he posted then why post it?
3) why exactly is it that you are "sticking up for" him?  I noted that
he had expressed a common attitude (that I do not personally share and
still find amazing after all these years), and you leap from that to
him requiring some sort of defense?  I had not realized that being a
"normal" human being required defending in a secular forum.

Yeah, first trip across Antonica is the best.  Mine took 5 days IRL:
1 day to get halfway there and die repeatedly, 4 days of regearing
from scratch until a L14 Druid offered to help me (and the friend
whol died with me) recover our corpses (we were L9 Paladin and Monk,
iirc, EK was our bane).
