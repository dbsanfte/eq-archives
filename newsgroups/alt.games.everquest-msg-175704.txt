Got there fairly easily the first time invis, only took a wrong turn
once and left the zone by accident... at least I found the zone out
:).   I left and came back wanting to make sure I had the path strait. 
My invis wore off, I conned everything wandering around and nothing
seemed to be kos, so I kept going then I was attacked by the rats, which
the first few I passed were dubious and hadn't attacked me.  Got off
color flux ran off and gate out.  Took me about 20 minutes to get my
health back.  So I came back and it was camped - by a group all higher
lv than me :)

I came back this morning, and it wasn't camped.
I was able to pull one punisher using pacify on the other.  After it was
dead the enforcer broke and started hitting me, my color flux didn't hit
it, it was apperantly too far away.  Long reach - I wasn't expecting
that.  I tried rooting it, it resisted.  I tried mezing, couldn't get it
off kept getting interrupted, should have just run perhaps.  I died. 
Got a rez and decided to try again another day - got a peridot off of
the punisher.  I'll try meming the higher lv colors instead, but I hate
doing that since they take longer to cast.

They really beat each other down, I didn't have a chance to slow the
punisher until it was down to 1 bubble.  Are you Nuking too?  Any more
specific tactics welcome (although I'll try my own of course).

It does look like it might be pretty good once I get used to it.  Always
have a death or two until I get used to a zone or 50 if I don't get used
to it and give up :)...
