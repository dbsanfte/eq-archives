Any reason you felt the need to sign off here? :)

*shrug* I dunno.  Why 'ranger port'?  Which I *also* asked already.  
Who's ignoring who here? :D  And thanks for clearing up why on earth 
anyone would do such a thing anyway.  I couldn't imagine anything except 
maybe grabbing something from the bank that you *really* needed and 
managed to forget.

Exactly :)  Verant needs to implement about a dozen more inventory slots 
in the bank.

Not that THOSE would be empty for long.

Well, most of the time I ignore it, but during downtime, I peek in and 
see what's up, and when I'm looking for something to buy or have a 
question about the class, it's handy to already be in there.  I have 
serverwide.age, serverwide.eqtraders and serverwide.necro on autojoin.  
age is the only one I pay any real attention to.

Oh I dunno.  He seems nice and malleable.

::cackle:: I'd be so tempted as a monk.  "Okay, your puller (played by 
me) just ran up with six red mobs on his back and died, dumping them in 
YOUR lap.  What do you do?  WHAT DO YOU DO?" *feign death*
