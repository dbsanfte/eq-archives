Hmm. sorry. They are the tactics I followed and I felt they worked well,
considering
enchanters are NOT a solo class per say.  I fear kited with my pet, mezzing
if my pet
died. recast pet and kept at it. Not really many options for an enchanter
lower than
12th.  While it was feared, I would help by beating on it and DOTing it. I
tried to
never DD it since it would agro on me again.
As far as group, debuf and limited traffic duty. Do not forget your stun
spell, but you
have to be in Hand to Hand range to make it work. Enchanter is one of those
classes
that, at lower level, not many really need your talents, but after 12th and
especially
after 16th you will be BEGGED to group.

Hope this helps. If there were more, I would include it. I have made it to
25th with my
enchanter and am enjoying ill omen in groups.
