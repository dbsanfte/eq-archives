I don't agree.  There's a big difference between feeling a certain
way and enforcing that feeling on my neighbors.  I'd never consider
an abortion (except under the most severe circumstances like rape
or incest); however, I wouldn't make abortion illegal.

Do I consider some people who have abortions irresponsible?  Yes.
Mainly people who use abortion as a type of birth control repeatedly.
But I *still* wouldn't make abortion illegal.

Yikes.  That's a scary subject.  But I'm just trying to make a point.
I can feel someone is being irresponsible without taking away their
right to do it.  There's no conflict.  You're assuming I can't do that
and you're wrong.

My post that sparked these flames was, unfortunately, worded for
dramatic effect; but in fact, I don't want to shoot anybody.  I don't
believe in murder.  Please forgive me for my poor choice of words,
and that is meant without sarcasm.

The children themselves are never to blame, of course.  And once
they're born, their parents have a responsibility to care for them.

At some point, you have to put yourself in the hands of someone
else.  You have to trust that the engineers at Ford built your
car right, or that the carpenters built your house right, or that
your doctor will heal your injury right.  (You don't have to blindly
trust them, of course; some minimal research and knowledge is
undoubtedly helpful.)

At some point, even parents should decide, "Is having children right
for me?  My husband and I are both carriers of X, and any of our children
would have a 50% chance of contracting it.  It would ensure them a short
life filled with pain.  Should I risk it?"  Perhaps at that point they
should talk to doctors, their spiritual leader, their insurance company,
their friends and family (if appropriate), etc.

Should they make the final decision on their own?  Probably.  Should
they make that decision without advice from multiple sources?  No...
I didn't mean to imply doctors were demi-gods with all the answers; but
they seem the best qualified starting point for parents that find them-
selves in the aforementioned position.

: But its a key point. As soon as you advocate that some authority gets to 
: decide who gets born and who doesn't

This is a key area where you misunderstand me.  I've probably already
made it clear (above), but I'll reiterate it: obviously, the final
decision is made by the parents.  Legally, morally, and ethically, this
is the way it should always be, in my opinion.  Freedom is sacred.

However, I won't be made to feel compelled to not judge people the way
I see fit.  By judge them, I don't mean "judge them to death", I merely
mean judge them in my own mind, as in: "Hey, these people did something
I consider irresponsible."  Anyone who claims they don't judge people
in their mind all the time are just liars, in my opinion, though it may
be the politically correct thing these days, to lie and say you don't.

: 'you'd' like their to be a 'reliably compassionate objective authority' 
: such a entity isn't available to us.

Some people would argue with you on this (I'm *not* one of them!).  Some
would say the Christian Bible is the ultimate authority, for example.
And that the Church should be the ultimate deciding factor.

Be careful!  You just stepped on some toes yourself!

: Working with what we do have: 
: special interest groups, political agendas, corporations driven by 
: capitalist mandates, corrupted and corruptable people, outright whackos, 
: etc... how does one assemble a panel.

Ultimately, those with the necessary power (political, military,
religious, whatever) make those decisions for everyone else, though
it's nice to live in a country where we (for the time being) mostly
have freedom.  George W. Bush is eroding those freedoms to the best
of his abilities, of course, but it's still a darn good, and free,
country.

Hey, I agree with you.

I agree with you here, too.

Ah, ok.

Looking forward to your response!  This is quite intellectually
stimulating, thank you.  :)
