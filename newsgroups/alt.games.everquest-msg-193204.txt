I have a 61 mage.  A while back I started 2 boxing a cleric.
Cleric/Mage works well.  Pets tank well on xp mobs (before
PoP).  With cleric buffs and heals, the fire pet becomes MUCH
easier to use.  With its innate damage shield and buffed HP
and cleric heals, you get far more mana efficient kills.

Paladin also works well, they are good tanks (and preferred
for XP groups in PoP).  The problem here is the lack of damage
output, ergo slower kills.

Not sure about the necro. 

Personally I'd group with the mage until they're in their 30's
then try out the cleric/paladin combo - see which you like better.
