There are four tier ones

You forget Justice.  Yes, I know, thats where the trials happen, and there's no
way a 52 cleric is going to "pass" one.  But there's plenty of other stuff to
hunt in PoJ, some of it goes cyan to 61, so its really not all that high level.
In particular, sentries can be pulled to the zone out and at any rate are non
social for other sentries (attack a prisoner and its a different matter
entirely).  I can't think of a safer thing for low levels to do in all the
planes than pull sentries and rats to the PoJ exit, and I've never seen anyone
doing it, you'd probably have it all to yourself (at least unless there are
other AGE lowbies on your server)

Ethereal Remedy is worlds better than anything a 52 cleric has.  Supernal Remedy
is worlds better than that.  A few months ago, I'd have agreed that a 60 cleric
was little better than a 52 cleric with a deeper mana pool, but now I'd have to
take issue with that.  On the other hand, if you stick to easier targets, a 52
cleric should certainly still be adequate to the challenge.

I thought they said there would be mini-planes set up so that many small groups
could do single group events without having anything to do with other groups.
No, only one group at a time, and MAN can you get screwed if anyone is still in
there after their trial and you come in for yours.  Succede on a trial and
there's a 30 minute  wait.  30 MINUTES.  Whats the reasoning there?  How about 5
minutes pass or fail?  Thats plenty of time to get everything cleaned up,
frankly, and there's no safety net at all after failures and yet one six times
as long as necessary for success.  This creates an atmosphere where three
quarters of the people in the zone are secretly rooting for you to fail!

I haven't observed this, but I have seen what looks like blatent class
targeting; I can stand in the middle of the group, not casting anythign for five
minutes, and a wanderer will come by and attack me over everyone else in the
party!  Racial profiling by werewolves?  I dunno, but I sure don't appreciate
it.
