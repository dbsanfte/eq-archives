I'm not sure, but doesn't this approch assume that the zones are scaled
the same?
What I mean is...have a look at PoFear. It is a awful small zone if
you're going by the /locs. For me it seems there is far more ground to
cover to move the same distance as it is for instance in the feerott. It
doesn't seem this way as the objects are properly scaled. This would
explain the somewhat wierd aggro too as mobs aren't that far apart as
they visually appear to be.
But as I said this is purely an observation. I don't have hard data to
support my claim. :/
So to make the illusion perfect they have to adjust walking speed not
just jboots speed. Any thoughts on that?
