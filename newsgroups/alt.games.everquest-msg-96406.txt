So does this mean that Sony / VI have found a way (*) and are "removing"
hell levels or does it mean that they have not found a way and are not
removing hell levels ?

*) I have found a way, inside of about 10 mins of thinking about it, but
I have no idea how hard it would be to code, or even if it is possible
to code (I guess everything is possible to code, but what is the effort
: return ratio like ?)
