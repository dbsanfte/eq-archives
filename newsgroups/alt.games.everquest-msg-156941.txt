I pull solo or with 1 partner, I dont like any more than that in the nearby
vacinity of the mobs.. sometimes theres exceptions, like if im teaching
somebody a pull, or specific mobs that are easier with more (and the monks
dont be getting in the way of each other)

I really doubt it..  the statues loot has been rotting (/ooc xxx item FFA)or
banked for quite a long time now for us.. reavers, swiftblades, hammers,
scrolls, even his breastplate.  That won't change as we get higher level,
the only reason we kill him is as a pre-requisite for AoW
