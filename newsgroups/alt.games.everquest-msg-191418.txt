Hell, while we're at it:

See any obvious gear upgrades for a now very poor ranger?

Things I'm looking at upgrading are the boots, Hero Bracer, get
another Vah Shir earring, and a better cloak when I can get around to
it.  A new helm is last on my list.  I already have a Mushroom Veil on
my mule that I need to get to Att.  I also keep a couple of Velium
Fire Wedding Ring's in my gear bag to swap out if I'm going to be
tanking, so don't bitch.  :-)
