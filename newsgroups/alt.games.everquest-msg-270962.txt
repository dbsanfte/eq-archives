Nah, you can hold whatever you like in inventory, its only when equipped 
that you may run into trouble, apparantly.  Its just an anti twink 
device; if you don't have someone actively PLing you by buffing you up 
to where you can wear the stuff, the stuff stops working.

And its not just for PLing; this is a process built into the game, buffs 
from one class enabling another class to use better gear, as long as you 
can keep the buffs running.  Imagine if an enchanter could enable a 
warrior to equip gear that is restricted at 20 levels higher than he is 
(and imagine all EQ gear had level restrictions, so he's not already 
wearing gear dropped by mobs 50 levels higher than him, and sneering at 
your pathetic 20+ items)

Well yes, but you don't need lots; one good HP and one good Nano kit 
will last several missions, and in several missions you can put together 
5K while making 10 times the exp you'll get in the same time on the island.

I'd be more excited about the ability to buy all the small nano crystals 
you can get in the basic shop, which you can use but which weren't in 
the nano kit from the island.  Lots of interesting abilities in there, 
if you have a few Kcr on you.
