I'd go with a Troll or DE if I was creating an SK, but that's just me (I
don't like running an Ogre).

Iksar is a good choice for BL. Field of Bone and Kurn's Tower are both good
places to hunt, the Iksar warder looks cool, and  the regen comes in handy.
I've got an Iksar BL alt, and I've had a lot of fun running him.
