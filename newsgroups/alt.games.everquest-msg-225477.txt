That sounds extremely low, for some reason.  Even at it's worst, I always
gained a blue and a half of real exp in a full LDoN run.

At 55, LDoN slows down dramaticly.  In my experience, that is when the "high
level target bonus / low level target penalty" system begins to kick in.  In
a LDoN "level 55" mission, you'll be getting mobs that are lower than you...
and if you happen to get averaged down to "level 50",  you're getting mobs
that are *barely* full blue.   If you can get in a group with higher levels,
you'll still get planar level expereince gain... but for a full group all
the same level, you'd all be better off actually going to the planes.

Raid exp is never very good.  You forfiet all group bonuses (and possibly
take a penalty).  So instead of double exp getting split 6 ways, you get
normal experience split 8 ways.   That being said...  IMO, adding raid
experience was one of the best changes they ever made.
