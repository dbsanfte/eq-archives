All the things you're talking about are in either the general files
(player models, etc.) or in the patched version of the zone files
you have.   So, yes, you would see the dock in Butcherblock, and
even the shuttles.   If you tried to ride one, though, you'd get a
message that the "zone is down" and would be transported to the
"safe place" in Butcherblock.

The expansions give you access to any interface changes as well as
the zones;  players and equipment are global, so you'd see those
anyway.
