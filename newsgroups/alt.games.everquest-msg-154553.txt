No, not really.

Just try the basic EQ version or the Trilogy box with the graphics
set to low and you should be fine.
It will play at your 128M ram, you'll just see slow zoning times.

BTW- anyone know if you can still download basic EQ for free
from the Sony website?  That would be a true rezo-cost means
of trying the game for 30 days.
