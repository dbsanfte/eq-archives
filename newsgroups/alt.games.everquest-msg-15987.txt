You know when you nuke something and it says you hit it for X amount of
non-melee damage?  Only you get that message.  All everyone else sees is
"An Orc Centurion convulses as lightning arcs through them".

If you are in a group that thinks that (1) you need to nuke a lot, and
(2) won't give you time to med between fights, try switching back to
your level 8 or level 4 nukes.  That will cut your mana use way down,
so you can put on the show your group wants. :-)
