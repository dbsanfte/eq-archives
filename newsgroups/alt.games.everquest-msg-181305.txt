    Default answer #8

    Yeah baby, I miss EC and think the bazaar is stupid.

    Of course, since I started playing in sep last year..... uh... im not
sure WHAT exactly I'm missing about east commons. I still go there
occasionally, sometimes just to splatter an orc camp and see how many
seconds it takes these days :)

    Theres this big empty area in the tunnel? What the hell is all that
about?

    Then again, being that I'm on the Povar server, apparently it was
gaydark that had the player run bazaar thingo, so I have no option but to
inform you that your guesses are...... really..... way off.

    Can you ask yourself ( yes I know only completely insane people ask
themselves questions, but give it a go this once for me ) if you really
honestly think this cartography thing adds anything to the gameplay, or
simply makes things easier yet again? Furthermore, were you just jumping on
the bandwagon and having a good old flame, or did you seriously think I
needed to be ridiculed?

Cheers,
James
