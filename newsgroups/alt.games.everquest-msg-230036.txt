Perhaps.  I'd say unlikely.  Track doesn't go up quick, it's not a skill
that you can make go up invisibly by tying it to a movement hotkey, you
level 4x faster (4x?), and all skills get reset on death.

Nor +mana armor though, which makes nuking an equal level warrior down less
appealing (not entirely unappealing, I think wizards are top notch in PvP
and would be in that environment as well).

A wizard comes up to a warrior and a ranger side-by-side and both at half
health, which one is he gonna nuke?

It also does bring up the innate MR warriors have from level 1.
