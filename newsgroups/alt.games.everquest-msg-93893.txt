I was not in any way flaming you, I was pointing out, reasonably politely I
thought, that the PGP is annoying, and that you had inaccurately stated
information regarding encryption.  I would also add that, if I recall
correctly, the restriction on exporting encryption has been significantly
relaxed.  So long as you post in a civil manner, you can expect the same
from me, you can also expect that if I happen to have an opinion on
something you post, I may post a follow-up.  I may also correct information
you post that I believe to be incorrect, I am not likely to correct grammar
or spelling, unless you do so first, or you happen to hit on one of my pet
peeves.
