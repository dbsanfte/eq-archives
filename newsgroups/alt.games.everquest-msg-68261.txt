Try this, from someone in another group:

I recently upgraded from DirectX8.0a to 8.1, and all of a sudden none
of my DirectX 8 apps/games would run.  Running dxdiag.exe would
complete the DirectX7 test fine, but would give the following error
when trying to test DirectX8:
Direct3D test results: Failure at step 5 (GetDeviceCaps): HRESULT =
0x8876086a (3D not available)

Here's what I did to fix it on my PC.

Run dxdiag.exe and go to the "Display" tab.
Even though the line that reads "Direct3D Accelleration says:
"Enabled", go ahead and click on the "Disable" button.  When I did
that, the message I got was that Direct3D would now be ENABLED.

Toggle the D3D Enable/Disable button untill you actually see the text
change from Disabled to Enabled.

IMO it seems that a registry setting in the DirectX8.1 install is set
to an incorrect value that the dxdiag tool displays D3D as being
Enabled when in fact D3D is really disabled.

FYI: The other buttons don't seem to share this problem

I hope this works for you too!
