Not to mention they all proc'd fucking blind. I still chuckle when I
remember Tigole's exclusive pictures of vt that were all black.

To be fair, GoD not only brought it back but made it worse than the
previous worst I can remember, which was running back to NToV after a
wipe. Running back to yxtta after a wipe would have been 100x worse than
the run to NToV.

As well, GoD has to be the first expansion where they've fallen down
badly on the one claim to fame EQ has; interesting zone designs. Instead
we got the same basic outdoor design, and the same basic indoor decor
(which incidently appears to be mostly textures ripped out of Srae)
Dispite the complaints about cut and paste zone design in LDoN, they
actually went even more overboard on doing as little art as possible
with this expansion, so even when you progress to a new zone, it just
looks the same as the last fucking zone you were in.
