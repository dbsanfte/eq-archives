Sorry, but I'm pretty sure "fair use" would allow it. The law may be
clear, but I'm not so sure you are with respect to those details.

Neither is at question here. No one is copying anything. Also, it's
not a sign of disrespect. If anything, it amounts more to paying
homage.

Getting a bit dramatic there, but fine. Sure, it would be nice to have
their blessing, but it wouldn't really make any difference. For one,
everyone already knows what the answer would be and why (greed -
ruling out pretty much any emotional aspects of the discussion).
Secondly, they would have absolutely no way of even knowing of the
existance of this private server, much less being affected by it in
*any* way. I just don't see how they could demonstrate any damage or
even risk thereof to their intellectual property.
