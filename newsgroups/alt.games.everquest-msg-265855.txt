2 Easy answers and a not so easy answer. First off for Pdophilia and 
beastiality its a matter of being able to make a choice of entering in to 
said behavior. Animals, and children dont have the proper coginitive 
abilities to make that choice, and in affect can never give thier consent.

As for Polygamy / Bigamy.. *Shrug* Its a matter of what society and the rule 
of law has determined to be the accepted norm. Society has detrmined that 
those are both unacceptable and passed laws accordingly.
