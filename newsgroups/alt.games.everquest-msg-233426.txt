I'd like to get involved in this as I have time problems too due to poor
health... I haven't grouped much with other people and mostly played
conservatively, and being 56 druid without much experience with
raiding/dungeons etc has made me very wary of embarassing myself or
resulting in other peoples deaths in a LDON adventure.

 I have a 20 beastlord but haven't been able to get into an adventure with
him to 'learn the ropes' and can't find an equivalent to eq atlas to learn
the zones.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
