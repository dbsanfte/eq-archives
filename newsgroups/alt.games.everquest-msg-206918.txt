Doing it once to escape from a mob would be highly unlikely to be an 
issue.  Using it as a strategy to defeat mobs would be far more likely to 
be an issue.  If someone petitioned, and a GM felt like coming on over, 
he'd come over invis, and watch what happens, if he sees you repeatedly 
using this as a strategy to defeat mobs, then, quite likely you'd get 
dinged for it.
