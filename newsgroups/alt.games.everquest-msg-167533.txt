Tae had varying experiences there during his, oh, week of exping.  One 
group was outstanding.  Several groups were good, no complaints at all.  
Two groups were just frightening - one because the monk, puller and tank 
of the day, kept failing his FDs at bad times and said "guess I should 
work on FD, huh?" (Uh...yeah?), and the other... oh, god, the other.  I 
killed maybe two things before I ran away screaming.  As soon as I 
joined I asked who I was assisting so I could set the assist hotkey.  No 
answer.  Fifth time, when I typed it in all caps, I got "um... assist 
druid?"  Gyah.  I watch the first pull and decide to assist the paladin 
who, although she isn't holding aggro worth shit, seems to be the one 
trying to tank, and therefore will be making decisions during adds.  
Second pull, kill it.  Third pull, druid somehow manages to get himself 
killed on a pull.  After that, the group got even messier, and I finally 
got a chance to leave when two people wanted to join, but that would 
leave no room for a replacement healer.  I believe I said something like 
"if you need a healer I'll leave and find another group, g'luck 
everybody, bye" /disband ... one minute later I got a tell from another 
in the group who said "damn you, I was about to get out, but you beat me 
to it".

So... yeah.  Ups and downs.
