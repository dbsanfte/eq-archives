At level 14, you should be able to stay in everfrost if you want, just have 
to find the right mobs to kill there.  Blackburrow is a good spot as well, 
but, the best solo spot for xp in game at your level is Paludal Caverns.

As for maps, you can use maps from www.eqatlas.com, just print them out, 
and keep them handy.  That's how I did it for most of my playing, as LoY is 
pretty recent.
