However, I'm quite sure I don't really care whether you like me or not! :-)

Look, everyone has their little things that bug them.  Personally, mine is
the misuse of like sounding words (their/there/they're, your/you're, etc.).
I don't post about them everytime I see them as it's not relevant to a.g.e.
(not to mention the fact that I would spend all of my time posting).

At dead level best, what you present is a chicken v. egg arguement.  If you
wish to continue it, email me.  My spamblocker isn't that hard to figure
out.  I check that box about twice a week.

You originally posted a commentary.  I responded with info.  You replied
with some venom, obviously looking for a response.  It was late, I had just
finished a multi-corpse run night, and I responded ... doom on me.  I was
willing to drop it at that point. You responded with an attack on me (not
extremely aggressive, but an attack nonetheless, see above).  I have replied
to that attack, and have offered to take it offline if you wish to proceed
along this line.  That's as far as I go ... this subthread is now killed.

Feel free to have the last word.
