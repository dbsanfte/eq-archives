	I disagree completely.  If anything it is too low.

	Any all-you-can-eat price scheme on commercial muds is unrealistic.
People used to pay for these games by the HOUR when they were TEXT ONLY,
running up bills of hundreds of dollars a month (over and above online time).

	You can bet your lungs the next generation of these games is going to cost
more.  It's a miracle that they haven't raised the price on EQ's basic
service, not even to allow for inflation.
