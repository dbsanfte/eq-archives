The first sentence of the paragraph above offers a better answer to the 
second one than any I could possibly come up with.

Invade the country where Mecca sits? I can't vouch for GWB, but I don't 
think his advisors are *that* crazy... One 9/11 is already one too many. 
Iraq is weak, demoralized, and has no friends, so it's a much easier 
target.

If there are, I'm yet to hear them. So far, "the US is scared of Iraq" 
doesn't sound entirely convincing.

Now, that's rich. The issue here is the US taking umbrage at the fact 
that France also has a sovereignty, and that they don't feel that 
gratitude over American help in WWII necessarily extends to taking it in 
the ass forever and evermore.

Of course, like many Americans keep bashing the French in general, 
instead of the current French administration in particular. Political 
arguments have a way to degenerate into inane flag-waving like that... 
But, you'll have to admit, nobody in Europe has started renaming foods 
yet.

And from over here it looks like the US will cynically abuse the support 
received after 9/11 for profit, and won't let either the UN nor almost 
unanimous world opinion get between their oil-crazed president and the 
petroleum he craves, while the French, Russians and Germans are the only 
ones with the balls to stand up to them, at least symbolically.

Pretty fucking unfair, I'll be the first to admit, but at least we're 
both clear now on how the other side is perceived at the militant 
grassroots level.

Well, I have a much better idea of what America is than most Europeans, 
what with it being first hand and all that; I was just trying to come up 
with a few things that Europeans generally like, but perhaps I didn't 
need to look that far... After all, even the most rabid anti-American in 
this newsgroup is -or has been- paying good money to an American (after 
a fashion) corporation to play an American game.

Some of my conversations with nominally "anti-American" friends resemble 
the skit "What have the Romans ever done for us" from The Life of Brian. 
Hell, even the most vocal of them loves Bill Hicks, American cars and 
"Starski and Hutch".

I wonder that too... Definitely, if he had weapons of mass destruction, 
now is the moment to use them. So far, though, not a sausage.

Well, you say potato, I say potato. I guess it all comes down now to 
whether American oil companies go on to be the greatest beneficiaries 
from the spoils of this war, and to whether any weapons of mass 
destruction are actually ever found.
