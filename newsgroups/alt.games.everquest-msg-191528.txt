No.  Primary hand damage bonus becomes more and more important as you
gain levels.  My post in the "Ranger dual-wielding..." thread explains
the rule-of-thumb formula I've used to compare weapons, which is based
on parses I've done of Paladin and Warrior combats.  In general, if
your Ranger has a low (100ish) STR you can make a reasonable comparison
with ((base damage * 1.5) + level bonus damage) / delay.  A higher STR
and/or ATK buffs and/or weak opponents require adjusting the 1.5
multiplier upwards, unusually high AC opponents require adjusting it
downwards to keep it in line with actual damage per hit.  But just
going with the rough formula you can see that as your damage bonus
grows delay will become more and more important.  At L40 (5 dmg bonus)
if we compare a Centi LS [14/27 becomes ((14*1.5)+5)/27 or 26/27] to a
Defiance [9/19 becomes ((9*1.5)+5/19 or 18.5/19], so in primary hand
you would expect the Defiance to slightly outdamage the Centi LS in
most circumstances for a low STR melee at L40.  If you're massively
buffed the Centi LS would improve more than the Defiance, if you're
fighting over your head (say against elementals in The Hole) the Centi
would suffer more than the Defiance.  And if you're a Ranger then I'd
recommend a Wurmslayer in primary for the best dmg vs. agro ratio you
can get (also nearly the best dps you can get period until you're in
your 50s unless you've got an awful lot of pp to spend).
