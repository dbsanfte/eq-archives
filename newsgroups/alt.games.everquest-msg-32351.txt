Hello all, 38 yr. old, former D&D player here.  I began playing EQ 3
weeks ago and have been reading, with some amusement, the posts here
for the past week or so.  EQ reminds me of the days spent in the
college dormatory playing D&D, except now it is played on the computer
screen.

A few comments on the recent "Names" thread which is approaching 500
replies (And I do not wish to start another).  I have been posting to
many newsgroups since the days when the only definition of SPAM was a
ghastly meat(?) product.

On the matter of the name reporting, I feel that if a violation had
occurred, then a report of it was in-line with rules of the game and
have no problem agreeing with the person who reported it.  However,
being Devil's Advocate, I also feel that reporting only one name and
not reporting ALL names that violate this policy is a bit selective
and unwarranted.  As I ran through several zones last night, I counted
no less than 39 potential violations of the naming policy.  Everything
from 2 variations of the word "Kermit" as a name for an Iksar to names
such as Azzcrax and Furrberrgerr.  I suppose that everyone has a
choice on whether to report the names or not, but from what I have
seen, I would be spending half my time reporting names and from the
discussions on Kill Steals and the like, I would prefer the GM's to be
attending to those matters as opposed to changing someones goofy name.
 Maybe a 1 week suspension would deter starting these names to begin
with.

As to the newsgroup itself, I find most of the material informative
and have used much of it already in playing the game.  The only
problem I see with the group is a complete lack of tolerance to any
opposing views on any subject.  In reading the posts, I see that there
is a core of posters who seem to control the group and when a new
person offers an opposing view, they are immediately flamed out as a
dork, child (Which some of them probably are), or are accused of being
the same person.  I realize, of course, that this explodes into a
name-calling thread such as the "names" thread, not only by the
replying individuals, but by the original posters (I am not pointing
out Lokari here..no offense intended).

Hopefully as a new poster, you could grant me some slack and not flame
me to horribly on my first post to the group
