I've been playing a Warrior Troll for some levels, and I'm enjoying him 
immensly. Just to add a comic note to him, I saved quite a bit of money, 
and dyed his entire armour very, very yellow. So now I have a Troll in a 
yellow tin can so to speak. But I just happened to stumble across some 
other players who were wearing the same colour of armour, so I inquired, 
and it seems its player made deity armour. This one was wearing Cazcic 
Thule armour with very, very nice stats.

Now I made my troll agnostic, will that kind of armour be available for me 
when I hit the higher levels. (I'm only lvl 12 as of now) Or would it be 
wiser to start over and pick a deity. The major reason for me to go 
agnistic was, that I had the idea I could raise factions in cities like 
Qeynos by killing gnolls and such, but that doesn't seem to work, since 
they still kill me on sight....


Thanks in advacne,

Khalistro
