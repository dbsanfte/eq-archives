Not necessarily.  Assume I wish for someone to kill me.  If I accept this 
axiom as my guiding moral tenet, it behooves me to attempt to kill 
everyone I meet.  Perhaps that's what's going on in someone's mind when 
they go postal.

It's a funny old world, isn't it?  I do like the axiom, but it's not 
-quite- perfect, somehow.
