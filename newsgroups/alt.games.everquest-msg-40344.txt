one of the things i like about DAoC is the fact your characters can wear not
just cloaks, but hooded cloaks (i'd love to play a ranger ala strider, but
he's got to have a hooded cloak you can actually put the hood up and down
on).  i've been told by others in this group cloaks are coded into the 3d
models in EQ, just unavailable to PC's for lag reasons...that some high
level monster characters have them.   i have been told tho by some that
gamespot shots where firiona vie (sp?) has a cloak are evidence not only are
there going to be horses, new character models, and new textures in the
luclin Xpack, but there are also gonna be cloaks?  anyone have a definitive
answer on this puppy?
