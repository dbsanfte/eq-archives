Lol, not LDoN related, but, last night, I went LFG, and immediately got 
asked by a Paladin, to come group in BoT CY.  So, I ran on over, and 
joined up, only to find out the group was all level 65, various guilds 
and unguilded people, Paladin, Ranger, Monk, Monk, Monk, Shaman(me).  
Paladin told me, I am healing, hasting, slowing.  I figured what the 
heck, worst case I die, not like I'm going to lose my level.  We 
proceeded to clear the Storm Riders going nonstop, around the courtyard 
for 2 and a half hours.  We stopped once for the Paladin to med for a few 
minutes.  Maybe someday when I am elemental flagged I will see better xp, 
but, that is, without a doubt, the best xp group I have been in yet.  We 
made just under 1 AA per hour there.

I just wish I had known how much easier the CY was than the giants prior 
to this.
