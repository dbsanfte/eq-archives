[The following is not just for EQ.  It applies to most PvP RPGs]

The biggest factor is probably grief players.  Having someone waste you
whole night, when they gain nothing from it but the "enjoyment" of ruining
your night, is not fun for most people.

In PvE, you've got good reasons for fighting the monsters: advancing in
levels, and getting loot.  Since most PvP games don't give XP for PvP kills,
and don't allow looting or at least restrict it, those goals don't apply for
PvP.

Although there is not a *lot* of roleplaying going on in most MMORPGs, I
think most people like to do a little roleplaying, and most games don't
really provide a roleplaying reason for your character to slaughter other
characters.  I'm not saying one can't find good roleplaying opportunities in
PvP (e.g., that "defending the swamp" thing from Flowers of Happiness is
a great example of outstanding PvP roleplay), just that most of the games
don't provide the background.  E.g., in EQ, there's a huge amount of story
behind most of the PvE game, providing a rich framework for roleplaying.

Another factor is class balance.  Because even in PvP games, advancement is
usually through PvE, classes have to be balanced toward PvE, which might not
be good balance in unrestricted PvP.  

But, it's probably mainly the grief players.

Anyway, those are among the reasons that PvP remains a minority taste in
most MMORPGs.  The only major exception I can think of is DAoC.  PvP works
there because:

1. The PvP is limited to the frontier zones, and there is PvE content in the
non-frontier zones for all levels.  In fact, with the new expansion, which
added only non-PvP areas, I think the non-PvP areas dwarf the PvP areas.
Anyway, this means it is easy to avoid the grief players.

2. There game's storyline supports and encourages PvP.

3. The PvP is oriented toward group vs group, not individual vs individual.
That makes class balancing a lot easier.  They just have to keep the overall
abilities of the realms in rough balance, not the abilities of every pair of
opposing classes.

4. There are rewards for PvP.  Conquering keeps and stealing the relics of
the other realms increases your power.  Killing enemies earns you "realm
points", which are basically an alternate XP system, and when you earn
enough realm points, you can buy special abilities.  (It's kind of like EQ's
alternate advancement abilities).

EQ's biggest innovation in MMORPG technology was *not* having PvP.  They saw
all the problems earlier games had with it, and made the brilliant decision
to focus the game on PvE.  DAoC's big innovation was coming up with a
workable way to get PvP in.  Coming in February (allegedly) is Shadowbane,
which will be the next major attempt at fairly wide open PvP.  It will be
interesting to see if it works.
