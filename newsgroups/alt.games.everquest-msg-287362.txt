Nah. I find myself soloing often enough, but there are groups to be
had. As long as you're an appropriate level for the zone you're in,
people will find a use for you. The only time I have a bit of trouble
is when I need to put together a complete group for a specific task,
like my epic or something.

Also, it's about to get a lot easier to play AA catch-up. They're
getting ready to implement an AAxp curve that will give nice bonuses
to AAxp (like double) for those with fewer AA's.
