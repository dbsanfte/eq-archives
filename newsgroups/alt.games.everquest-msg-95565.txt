Hehehe I found that out the hard way, I was goofing around with a wood elf
warrior (shush, no comments about the combo lol) who worshiped Rallos, went
racing to Kaladim to group with a guildmates alt, ran by the guards at the
xroads without agroing them, ran past the guards at Kaladim zone and didn't
agro them, ran straight through the archway between the two towers just
inside kaladim and didn't agro them...hit the war guild and brought all of
Kaladim upon my little head lol, on my corpse run back I conned as I went
and sure enough was KOS to them all. Now they remind me of Rotweilers, they
let me in but sure as hell weren't letting me back out lol. That experience
came in very handy though, now my de cleric can safely run in to a point if
needed since I know they have a smaller than norm agro range.
