Hi,

I tried to login and got  the error 1014 message - You are not currently 
subscribed etc. etc. which is due to my credit card being renewed recently.  
It asks me if I want to subscribe now or later - I click on now and that 
takes me to the global collect button - I click on that which takes me to 
Sony's website and my account.  I click on that and it says You cannot 
modify your account subscription until the account has been closed.

I load EQ back up again click on Account and edit billing which takes me 
back to the website (and dead end) I was at previously.  I click on end 
billing and that gives me 0056 you do not have an active subscription to 
cancel!

Please can somebody help me out here I'm just going around in circles and 
getting nowhere.

Thanks to anyone who can help,

Steve
