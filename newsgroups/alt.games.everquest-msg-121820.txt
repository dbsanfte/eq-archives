The world is a big scary place. The internet is a big scary place. A 1 
second search of the web, or *any* newsgroup, will turn up a TON of 
profanity, pornography, and various other "filth".

I'll be sure to let my wife know when that happens! 

Your weak jibe at my name and your assumption that I work at a Taco Bell 
somewhere are ridiculously off-target. 

Just because we happen to disagree and you happen to believe you are right  
(eous) does not mean that my opinion is any less right, less mature, or 
less valid. It simply means that it is different.
