Is there an index to those archives at crgaming? I can only see
one of the site news, not these (the actual patch messages)

It's the one where they announced they were replacing the
original group bonus system with a "6th person does not count
when dividing the xp among the group" system... I think it was
around the beginning of this year?

I will happily give a reference and link if there is an index to
these (other than just spending 4 hours looking through the site
news hoping to catch references to the patch notes.)
