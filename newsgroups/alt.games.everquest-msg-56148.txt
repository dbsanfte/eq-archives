Funny how the thread starts with HP and ends with something else :)
One could also say that an SK is a much better taunter than a warrior
and much more able to protect his casters from level 1 - 60 in any
normal experience group.

One could now rant about how only warriors can survive ubermobs
(statue in Kael etc) long enough with their defensive discipline,
which is absolutely true .. but hey .. what exactly are we
talking about here?
