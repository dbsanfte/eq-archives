So you're saying it's better to be dead with lots of mana than alive with
less mana?

Again, you'd rather be a corpse with lots of mana than alive with a little
mana?

You play an enchanter...if you can't get by with 30m per fight you're doing
something wrong, even when you're the only slower.

My enchanter is level 57.  With Aego and Shielding I have about 2400hp.
With just HB or SLN & shielding, about 1600.  If something triples me for
450 per round when he's slowed I just laugh in his face, even with just
1600hp.  He'll never be able to kill me...he'll be dead long before.  I'd be
nervous if it was 750+, but with a dedicated healer (druid preferred, IMO,
but that's me) I wouldn't see my life flash before my eyes.
