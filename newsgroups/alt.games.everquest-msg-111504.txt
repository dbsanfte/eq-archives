The skill is flesh to bones.  It turns meat into bone chips.  Several high 
level characters on Innoruuk have been searching for a flesh-to-bone necro 
to help them get good faction in Cabilis.  One of the more sociable 
necros decided to get flesh-to-bone just because there was obviously a 
market for that skill.  The funny thing was that when the original 
requester asked if there were any flesh-to-bone necros, the concensus was 
that it was an absolutely worthless skill.
