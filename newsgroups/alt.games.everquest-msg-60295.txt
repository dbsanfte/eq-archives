> I would like to know why you are in a guild , what is it you enjoy about
it ?

It is so enjoyable to get booted for daring to argue with the guild
leaders....
:-(

First time I got booted for complex reasons, but I never broke any written
or unwritten guild rules... Well, half the guild (or what was left of it)
followed
me soon, when they couldnt get me back in.
Even half the high council, so I kinda had some backup...

The second time I leave for you to judge
(I'd really like to have some input on this):
I will just tell what happened, without telling you my point of view on
this,
except that I did it out of boredom and for the excitement:

I was in WFP, bored and with my brand new Jboots...
I decided to have one of those funny guard trains on me.
I shouted my first warning: "I will start a guard train to
zone in about one minute"

After that minute, I shouted a second:
"Will start train in some seconds"
and a third:
"will train guards from gate straight to EC zone"

No objections or complaints so far.

Then I ran past the guards, had them aggro me (ate an ugly hit :)
and made a straight dash for the zone.

Nobody (except me) got hurt, and nobody complained,
except maybe someone did in ooc or shout after i zoned out.

I wanted to share my experience with the guild,
told them about my train, and about two persons
(officers) had a problem with me risking to get
newbies killed, I objected to being flamed for it
(all in tells), and asked them if they saw it that way,
to bring it up on guild chat...
They only did after they had talked to all officers
in tells, and shortly after I was booted.
I did NOT swear or insult anyone in the process,
not even with the slightest words.
I don't really care about the boot, as after that
argument I didn't really want to stay in that guild anymore
anyways. I just think it is ridiculous to make such a fuss
about this (admittedly purposely done) train,
where I did my best to make sure nobody got hurt,
and apparently I succeeded...

Oh, did I mention the guild was an evil one?
I mean - I am a DEF necro!

Ok, I _did_ tell you about my point of view,
sorry, couldn't keep my opinion to myself...

Do you think I am a bad player for that?


Interested in your opinions,
