Don't worry about it - even if you don't skill up another point, when you hit
56, you will max your 1hb, offense and bash (to its current level cap) by the
time you hit 57.

When I hit 56 I had offense about 100, 1hb about 70 and bash 25.  Took me less
than half the level to get offense 200, 1hb 175 and bash to whatever the cap was
(something in the 150s I think) at that level.
