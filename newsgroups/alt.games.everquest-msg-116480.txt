> I am often told at Church by people that it is a danger to my faith,

Is it by those who think all technology is evil?  Or do they actually have
more of a valid excuse that can make some sense?  They can't blame it on the
worshipping of other gods, or the spells.  Personally to me the fact that my
character worships a certain god only means that some characters (NPCs)
won't like me no matter what I do, and I just have to avoid them or use
creative thinking and strategy in dealing with them.  I play a Dark Elf
Necromancer.  Don't necromancers believe they get some of their divination
from the dead (or something like that)?  I'm no where near that way in real
life.  Also because of being Dark Elf, that means that many humans don't
like me.  So can someone say that because my race in EQ doesn't like humans
that means that I hate all people too?  To me, and probably many others as
well, the spells, worshiping of certain gods, and other various things (such
as Dark Elves not being liked by humans) are not taken seriously, but just
effect the strategies that we are forced to use.  To me in EQ, racism
(referring to Iksars not being liked by any other race, or Ogres being KOS
in Freeport and Qeynos) isn't actually an appropriate term if compared to
real life.  If you compared the racism in EQ to real life, many who haven't
played EQ (or many of the deeply religious who refuse to understand, because
by listening to your explanation is giving into evil) would think of this as
white/black racism, when it is more like rotwiler/poodle (sp?) racism.
Although they are called races in EQ, the term "species" would fit more
appropriately if you were to compare it to real life.
    So personally I don't see how anyone can say that RPGs can effect your
religion/faith in real life any more than any other game can.
    It's the fanatics that I don't like, the "technology is evil...because
it is....and it is, well, just because it is".  One time I was with a
friend, picking up their boyfriend at work and while waiting on him we were
talking to another of his co-workers.  She'd made some comment about "I
don't know what some people would do without cell phones." and I responded
(joking) saying that there is no such thing as a non-evil phone company, so
that would make allot less evil in the world (SWBell, and AT&T being some of
the worst).  She (the religious lady without a sense of humor) was the only
one in the room to not realize the joke and went on to talk about how the
Internet and other technologies are just the devil's way of getting us all
to go to hell.
    I've never understood people like that.
