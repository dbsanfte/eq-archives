You're right. Why not? However, Kenneth to Ken, a shortening or a
reference in the familiar, is a completely different relation than
that of wizard to wizzie, which in the absence of any other
explanation, is merely an attempt to be new and fresh.

Besides, I'm not talking about RL here. I'm talking about what is
supposed to be an "immersive role-playing experience" which has been
contructed within a fantasy genre setting. I just bothers me that
people feel such a need to drag RL into it so often and bastardize
what is there. New and fresh really doesn't have any place in a static
fantasy environment. It's not a chat room where "fronting" runs
rampant.
