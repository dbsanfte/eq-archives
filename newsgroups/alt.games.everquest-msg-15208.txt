Ok, speaking from my experiences, both "from scratch" and twinked.

The first problem with edible goo is that fire beetle eyes do NOT stack. I
could buy a spit and make them on the go, but with the cost of that spit, I
could buy more than a stack of bread. And there are many areas where a spit
just can't be gotten easily: an evil Erudite starting in Paineel has to
travel to the other side of Toxxulia to pick one up, meaning a wait until
5th level at the very least. I don't recall ever seeing a spit in Rivervale;
the nearest a halfling could pick one up is Freeport! The ability to stack
becomes a very big issue then.

Second, there is the money issue. Your plan works great when you have a
higher level character with money. For a very lowbie, the 2 silver from a
fire beetle eye is good loot. All of my human characters started in Qeynos,
where there are LOTS of fire beetles and even most of the twink
powerlevelers will take the eyes. Very often, rat meat gets left to rot so
you don't even have the cost of killing the vermin. Same with wolf and bear.
With the meat free, you end up saving money and time by making sandwiches.
Also, there is the cost of skewers, either by buying them from a craftsman
or making them yourself (skewers are player made only AND they don't stack.)
Fish fillets are a bad item for a cash strapped person to work on, because
by the time you fished a few stacks, you could have gone out, killed, got
experience and looted enough to (guess what) buy bread :-)

If you have cash and time, that is fine. But when you are a poor, first time
player who wants to have fun rather than pathetically beg for coin outside
the bank.... :-)

There is some (albeit not much) money that can be made from baking. Try
auctioning fish rolls in the EC tunnel for only 3pp a stack, or strength
enhancing beer braised bear for 4pp a stack. I've known people who can make
a nice profit for just cleaning up after other people's kills. Baking with a
spit is something you can do while meditating (my druid alternates between
baking and fishing), before starting a raid or while auctioning other items.
