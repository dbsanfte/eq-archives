The trick to getting Vox, especially now post "make casting mobs tough as
heck" patch is not letting her CH herself.  Keep her AWAY from that wall.
If you're in a pickup raid on her and she CHs, it's pretty much all over.
IN GENERAL, pickup raids are not well balanced nor organized enough to
survive what essentially amounts to killing Vox twice in a row.  Now, a
guild raid of her is different.  I know of many guilds who have taken her
out after a CH, namely because they are organized enough to know what to do
if it happens and they have the buffs and mana to get em through it, not to
mention how to manage aggro and keep her in one spot.  But in a pickup,
where aggro tends to bounce from person to person and Vox ends up roaming
near the wall, the CH tends to be the call of death.  Talk the raid leader
into trying something like this- when storming the room to fight, first send
in the MA group only, and everyone else stays out for now.  Make SURE this
group has 2 paladins and a cleric, as well as the MA of course.  Have the MA
charge to center of room and start swinging, and have the cleric and
paladins just in casting range of the MA.  Let MA swing for a few- paladin 1
lay hands the MA.  MA is still soloing her- paladin 2 lay hands.  As this is
happening, the cleric is healing both him/herself, as well as the 2
paladins.  After the second paladin uses LH, HE calls the rest of the raid
into the room to engage in standard fare.  This is also the sign to the
cleric and the secondary MA cleric that MA healing is now theirs.  As long
as its well coordinated and the MA stays up, this is generally enough to
keep Vox aggroed on the MA and hence locked down in one spot.  I have found-
in my experience- that paladin LH do NOT tend to get aggro from Vox.  Maybe
I'm just lucky, I dunno- but it seems to work well.  The only time I have
managed to get Vox close to death (2%) we did it like this.  Only reason
raid failed was because someone had failed to see the red con icy terror in
the corner, which preocced to kill about 15 of us. Good luck to ya.
