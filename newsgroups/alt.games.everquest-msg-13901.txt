In Neriak, the vendor isn't far from the ramp to the
magician/wizard/enchanter's guild.

In the Ogre city, the vendor is on the right fork after you leave the
city.

In Kaladim, the vendor is the same "room" as the mine and bank
entrances. She has a beard.

In Paineel, the vendor is just outside the bank. He's also the only
vendor who shows you what's in his inventory.

In Erudin, the vendor stands in the greater room outside the bank
entrance.

In Felwithe, the vendor is right before you cross the bridge into the
city.
