Which is terrible from a strict role playing standpoint; how does the 
change get generated?

Still, they should either have the thing make change -anyway- (not like 
this is a vital role playing aspect of the game) or they should do away 
with it entirely; a "good roleplay but terrible game" mechanism is 
stupid, particularly as most people don't understand it.

One alternative thought I had was that they could improve the thing so 
it would make change out of your pockets, and forbid you to loot the 
cash if you have autosplit on and -can't- make change.  It would have to 
have a "within reason" setting, so that it wouldn't end up failing 
constantly when trying to divide 2 coppers amongst 3 people... but it 
would both do what you -think- the feature is doing (split the loot 
among the party as it falls) and do what Verant thought was needed (yep, 
its vestigial Vision at work) and make change without transmuting matter 
from one metal to another.

The other "bad thing" (tm) about Autosplit is that one class in the 
game, monk, gets a substantial bonus to AC for having very little 
encumberance, and cash adds up quick without giving any battle benefit. 
  Filling your monk's pockets up with spare change in order to get out 
of having a ML is both unkind and perhaps unwise (unless he never gets hit)
