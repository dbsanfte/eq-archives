Sebilis and Kael Drakkal will not be affected?  What does that mean? 
Those aren't server names are they?  If they are zones, how can they not 
be affected but all other zones are?  If I'm logged on in Kael can I 
keep playing?  Just be careful to bind inside or NOT DIE?

And what could be wrong that would require a patch EXCEPT on non UK Euro 
servers?

Sometimes I wonder
