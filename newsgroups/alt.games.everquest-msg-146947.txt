That isn't the case. This is running as specified by Microsoft. It
makes me think about two things, Allakhazam's needs cash, and his
adserver promotes scumbags. I am ready to pay Opera, and use them, or
go over to the Lynx browser.

Yes, it makes me think twice about my subscription. Ezboard has the
same problems, scumware and attempts to hijack my PC. As scumbags pop
up, I will block them.

The most aggresive sites for scumware that I block are gator.com
whenu.com and findthewebsiteyouneed.com. I recommend putting these
fools on quarantine.

If there is a way I can give Allakhazam more money by simulating hits
through him to these sites I would just to drive these crooks out of
business. Of course I wouldn't do that.
