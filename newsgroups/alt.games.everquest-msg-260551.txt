My mage bought those three spells (the greater ones) and then trying 
them out on literally dozens of chests over a wide range of levels 
(bought em in my 40s and tried, on and off, up to 65), and never once 
found a trap.

I still have the two reagents I purchased when I got the spells.

I've seen only five or six chests opened successfully over several 
characters playing in LDoN's.  Usually they get ignored, or we try and 
find traps but can't get an answer, and lack one of the three types of 
detect; even with all three present, we usually can't get an answer, but 
when trying to open, trigger a trap after all.

On the rare occaisions we've opened a chest, we've found augments same 
level as looted in the dungeon... but with an average of one augment per 
dungeon, this doesn't strike me as total crap the way it seems to strike 
you.  Or we've found items similar to those dropped off named, in one 
notable case, the precise same item that had just dropped off a named on 
the same run.  Haven't had the bad luck to see the one charge illusion 
potions many complain about; while I don't doubt they exist, zero out of 
six (or so) drops have been this, which suggests to me that the "booby 
prize" is a rare occurance.

However, I can't help thinking that I'm doing something wrong while 
trying to detect traps, because I'd think 25% of the time I would find 
one (assuming random distribution between arcane, divine, mechanical and 
no trap at all), which should mean three in twelve, or twentyfive in the 
roughly hundred times I've tried this... instead of zero.

If I'm doing that something wrong, though, so are most of the people I 
group with who can be bothered to try it out.

Grage, 56 berzerk who's never touched a trap
Splendid One, 65 Mage who's tried dozens of times
