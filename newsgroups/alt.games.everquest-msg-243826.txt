For the content that I'm doing, obsolete is probably too harsh of a
term but I think that I've played in GoD enough to see the writing on
the wall. Even with my regular 'non-uber' group, about the only place
I can think of where my mal-x and slow is really useful would be
Ferubi and I can see where that wouldn't be the case if we had raid
lvl gear.

That comment, along with another comment that they were aiming for
quicker fights in future expansions, is why I used the term obsolete.

Any idea where exactly the new slow and heal drops? Friends of mine
are trying to talk me in to farming the early trials for spells and
augments.

Hell, I'd be ecstatic if I healed half as well as a cleric. Sony took
one line of cleric heals to arrive at that number but you can't just
ignore all of the tricks that clerics have in their healing toolbox
that we don't get.

Silly shaman, whatever makes you think that they actually have a
vision? ...certainly not any of the recent comments by the developers.
Compare the intial GoD AAs (mostly pet related) to the ones that went
live and you can tell how unfocused the whole thing has become.

Let me know if you ever find out. <g>
