Hi everyone,

I currently have a 17th level High Elf Paladin.  Back when I was a
young elf some generous soul gave me a Silvery War Axe.  It has held
up well in the many battles since then, but I have started noticing
that the amount of damage I hit for is falling behind other characters
at similar levels.  It has a damage delay of 22 and a damage output of
6 and only weighs 2.5!  Because it has such a short delay and low
weight maybe the lesser damage is not necessarily a bad thing, but I
wanted to get some opinions from people here.  Should I start looking
for a new weapon?  I don't have a lot of plat to spend - maybe 40 or
so.  Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Lianah, Paladin of 17 Seasons, Morell-Thule
