I found the damned thing on a vendor for 60 some-odd plat.  I mentioned that
fact in my first post to this thread.  Was I supposed to pass that bargain
by because my damage will be capped for 2 levels and change?  I got
frustrated not long ago after my warrior died and was too casual about
getting the corpse.  So all his stuff rotted and he was naked.  Now he is
still naked, but he has a very nice 60 plat sword to hold on to while I get
some bronze armor or something for him.  May not be the best way, but it's
my char, so it's gonna be my way.  For reference, the sword did hit greens I
tested it on for 28 or 29 each hit.

Exactly my point when I said cash is the shortest route between my chars and
this quality of sword.  The other route is to level a whole bunch.  Not sure
where the breakdown in communication is here . . .
