Actually, I was responding to the fact that Jazz said several times in
the past that he was having a blast playing the Wizzy.

That said, it's not like Wizards are losing manaburn.  They aren't
going to be able to take our raid level mobs anymore with one six man
group, but manaburn will still be there.  How useful will it be is a
fair question, but all of the hubub about this is a little excessive,
IMHO.

And on one final note, for all the rending and gnashing going on, none
of this is actually in game yet.  Enough bitching, and this might not
see the live servers.
