But all the wizard can do is root and nuke.  Again, it's all in finding the
right spot and pacing yourself.

And they could put a cleric there, too.  And maybe a buffy-bunny.  Then no
one would ever have to group up.  But that's not their stated intent.  They
even went so far as to mention it in the last patch message.  I believe the
line was something like, "After all, this is a massively multiplayer game."

There are times that I thoroughly enjoy soloing .. a lot of times, as a
matter of fact.  Those are times when I want a slower pace for the night.
When I'm in the mood for a more rapid-fire gaming experience, I group.

I, too, have limited time online ... having two young kids who are in to the
soccer/baseball scene will do that to you.  You either have a practice or a
game with one of them seemingly every night.  Because of that, soloing was
my exclusive was of gaining XP until recently.  Then I learned a trick.

Now, before I group up with someone I've never met, I tell them up front ...
"I only have an hour or so to play.  That good for your group?"  If not, no
hard feelings.  But usually, the response is along the lines of, "Hey, an
hour of a cleric/chanter/ranger is better than nothing.  Come on down."  Not
everyone online is a power gamer, y'know.

It may (or may not) interest you to know that I have been trained (and
killed) more times than I can count for the sole crime of doing what you
just suggested.  Friends have had higher leveled characters come over to
where they were root/dotting something and nuke the mob to get it to break
root, then laugh at them it tells.

People seem to percieve ports to be different from rezzes.  May because the
porter is almost always solo, I don't know.

Again, though, SOE wants their game to be a group oriented game, not
Baldur's Gate with other folks in the background.  That's the way they
choose to have their world, and they will continue to makes moves to
reinfoce that goal.  As long as they makes changes (and, as has been
mentioned many times before, this is not a nerf ... they're just making KEI
work like my druid's Regrowth or SoE) to reinforce the grouping behavior and
are rewarded by increasing subscriptions, there's no reason for them to
change their belief that this is the way the game should be.
