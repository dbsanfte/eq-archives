Happens to the best of us. Truce?

Eh. I don't recall screaming about a lawsuit, personally. My opinion is that
a straight apology would've been far better than telling those of us who
use(d) Win95 to fuck off and die. :) I don't so much have a problem with
what Verant is doing, as opposed to how they're going about it. But then,
I'm also of the mind that Verant's entire PR staff should be violently
thrown out into the street. :) If Absor were working for me... er.. wait..
he wouldn't be. Suffice it to say, I think the man is an idiot. ;)

Incidentally, I think trying for a lawsuit is a bit extreme, plus it
wouldn't work anyway. Sony/Verant as a corporate entity has better lawyers
(read: more money) than any of us can hope to. It'd be a futile effort, and
would just tie up the already overworked US civil legal system with another
frivolous suit. I *still* think the woman who sued McDonald's for sticking
hot coffee between her thighs should be forced to found a charity to benefit
the chronically stupid.

I did exaggerate a bit. My wife and I certainly aren't in dire straits, but
we haven't got a ton of disposable cash for the moment, as I'm unable to
legally work at the moment due to the immigration process. What I was trying
(and failing) to point out was that $10/month for EQ is something that's
easily planned for, and in the long run, doesn't make much of a difference.
The cost of upgrading an OS is also quite doable, given ample notice that
it'll be required. Upgrading a PC, for the average middle-class person, is a
fairly large expense. In my case, I have a friend who's been an MSDN
subscriber for a few years now... he was kind enough to allow me the use of
his XP Home key, as he wasn't intending to use it (he's got Pro installed on
his machines). Win98 was never a viable option for me, as the OS refuses to
recognize my network card, which renders the machine rather useless as an
internet box. ;)

Going back to my earlier point... had Verant given even two weeks' notice
that Win95 wouldn't be supported, it wouldn't have been nearly as big an
issue. 2 weeks is plenty of time to find a bit of extra cash to grab a
Win98+ upgrade. The point isn't that Win95 isn't supported, but rather, that
Verant led those of us who use(d) Win95 to believe that we wouldn't need to
upgrade, right up until the servers came back online with SoL.

That said, I take less issue with Verant for their lousy customer service/PR
than I do with folks who flame Win95 users for being upset about VI's bait
and switch. We pay our 10 bucks just like anyone else does, and we
contribute to the community that is EQ... surely that's worth *something* -
common courtesy, at least.

And on the note of courtesy, I would very much appreciate an apology for
your earlier comments. They were not by any stretch of the imagination
appropriate or called for. Given that my wife has also been reading this
thread (she doesn't play, but likes to learn about stuff I'm interested
in... evil mac users ;), I believe you owe her an apology as well.

I think this entire thread is a good reminder that we should all be a little
more careful about what we say, before it's said. It's easy to fit a foot in
your mouth... tends to be a little tougher to extract it. Everyone's human,
and we all have feelings. Trust me, jaZZ, I don't at all like the fact that
I can't work at the moment, but there isn't a whole lot I can do about it
until we get our paperwork done and approved by the INS office. Given that
we just got married on the 2nd, and Jen had to obtain copies of her tax
returns, we're doing the best we can.
