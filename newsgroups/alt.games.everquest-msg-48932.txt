People in loio are just more newbie in general. I think an incident that
happened to me earlier this week kinda sums up a lot of the problem there.

Im playing my lvl 19 cleric, and I go over to the WM to pair up with a lvl
24 warrior. I arrive, we group, somone gives us sow, I follow him to the
west and we camp just outside these ruins. He pulls a single, and we kill it
pretty easily. He pulls another single, but we get an add. There are mobs
just wandering past us, so its not that surprising. So hes getting beaten on
a bit, and I start pumping in the heals. Naturally the second on then agros
on me (red to me) and starts whacking me around. Im down to 2 bulbs of
health and one of mana. hes down to 1 bulb of health, and then a third one
comes along. The guy wont run, even tho hes got sow. Ive told him my mana.
He knows im being beaten on anyway so I cant heal him.

I decide at this point that unless I run, im gonna die, so I tell him im out
of there. So we both start running for zone. By this point ive had about
enough of this guy. First he sets us up in a stupid pull spot (new spot for
me, i didnt know), then he expects me to heal him on 2 health, 1m and being
beaten on by a red. I say good luck and disband the group. next thing hes
/ooc'ing "not to group with such and such, else youll be left to die". I of
course apologized ooc for running on 2 health while a red was beating on me,
and also pointed out ooc that he should learn the concept of safe pulling
spots.

As I say, stupid newbies make for bad manners.
