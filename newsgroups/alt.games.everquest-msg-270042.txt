You can always just do like I did before books and PoK came out.  I 
walked to the zone I wanted to group in and started looking for a 
group there.  Walked from Paineel to The Overthere just to die and 
have to walk all the way back again.  That or you could just buy a 
Wizzy/Druid port and be to any area in a bit longer than if you used 
the book.  Gasp!
