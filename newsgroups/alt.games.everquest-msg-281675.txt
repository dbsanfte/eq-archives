My wife and I have been playing EQ since the beginning on laptops (one
toshiba and 3 different compaqs).  The most work I've ever had to do
was download the latest video drivers.  I had a harder time running
Worlds of Warcraft, but even that game I got working by downloading a
video driver.

I highly recommend the laptop, but it is much more expensive.  You
can't upgrade the video card (at least ours won't upgrade).  So, an
upgrade means whole new computer.

We bought the cheap laptops at best buy and circuit city for around
$800 a pop.  Then we threw in a ram stick for another $100.  The same
routine, about every 2 or 3 years.

Personally, I play enough games on the computer that $900 every 2.5
years is well worth it to me.  Guess that's under $400 a year or $40 a
month.  Costs less than our internet connection.

It's a whole lot nicer to be able to sit in the living room or move
that laptop in the kitchen if you want to make dinner while you wait
for a group to form.  With the silent cool technology, it's also very
quiet.  I can run full graphics mode as well.  I've found performance
to be great.
