The reason they think this is because for years the game Ultima Online
was the only real game around (Before EQ came out) and this type of
behavour was given the blind eye.  The game was ruled by twinks and
idiots whose only goal was to ruin the fun of others.  It was very
easy to get away with because of the massive amount of bugs and
expoits in the game.  Also anyone could make a character with the same
name so you never knew who they really where.

Thankfully I noticed right away that this type of behavour isnt
allowed and widely frowned on in EQ.  Its one of the reasons I love
this game.  There are so few people of that calabre in it.
