Actually, it does.

Close. If a 'contract' isn't binding then it is NOT a contract, and
never was one. Even though people that signed it may have thought that
what it was.
ALL contracts WHILST they are contracts are binding, but also if
something isn't legally binding it maybe one of many things, but
'contract' isn't one of them. ;)

Then we've different understanding of 'impossible' and 'perform'. While
I would not expect him to climb ladders with his hip in cast I think
getting a replacement workforce to my house, at no additional cost to
me, would not be unreasonable to ask for.

We go round in circles some so I'm going to snip most of it...

I disagree with your conclusion, but ... I am not going to challenge the
quote itself. It is good enough for me. I am happy with 'a court will
_ALMOST_ certainly conclude...'. Neither of us is represents a court.
You offered your opinion, I offered mine. We disagree.
I believe court rulings could be found to support either (although
example is a bit on a simplistic side). Perhaps the rulings tend to lean
more towards one side in the UK and towards the other in the US.

Your damages are, indeed $200. Earning another $100 was not a result of
my breaching the contract, but your initiative. It's not like you have
to sit on my drive as long as it would take you to paint the house. What
you do with _your_ time is your business. I promised to pay you $200 and
this is how much I owe you. What if you get another job that's worth
$400? You owe me $200 for my breaching the contract?!

Disagreement here. As long as we have a _contract_ it binds us.

Well, if it wasn't binding before it was voided it wasn't a contract
then either.

Two separate points here.
If it was made void than it is no longer binding, but it isn't still a
contract either.
If it wasn't voided and it isn't binding it isn't a contract, and prolly
was never one.
And it goes back to my original point - _CONTRACTS_ are ALWAYS, and
without exception legally binding. If something isn't legally binding -
it isn't a contract.

Yes, contract is voided. We are no longer bound by it, because it isn't
in place anymore - it does not exist, not because it wasn't legally
binding when it did.
