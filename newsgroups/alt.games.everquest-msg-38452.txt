	Oh, bull-fucking-shit.

	The game is an order of magnitude easier for the "true newbie" today than
it was back then.  Even the newest servers are overloaded with low-level items
that high-level players give away or sell for peanuts.  There's also a lot
more cash lying around to be had.  Imagine, for instance, someone /auctioning
on 3/17/99 "Stack of bat wings, 4 pp!".

	Yeah, and they LOST most of the ones they already had.  They added new
accounts by selling the game in different countries.  2/3rds of their user
base is now on the Pacific rim.  (When was the last new American server
opened, hmm?)

	Koster was off of UO when the changes you allude to were made.
