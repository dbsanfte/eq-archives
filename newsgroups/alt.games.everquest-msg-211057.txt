Recently dinged 34 and got my first pet.  There are a few things I don't like 
about this first pet and I'm hoping they get better and I get more in later 
levels.  First of all it seems I have to be really close to my pet before I 
can cast a buff or heal on it.  If I am at the edge of aggro range of a mob 
slowing and Dotting it I have to move in closer in order to buff or heal my 
pet.  I'd rather stay as far away from the mob as I can.  Also if my pet is 
getting low on health and I want to pull him back and let the mob dot to death 
while rooted I can pound on the Back button and the pet will not listen.  He 
continues to fight until he dies and I've wasted a whole bunch of mana that it 
took to create him.  Last thing that bothers me is it seems I have to pretty 
close to a mob before my pet will even attack it.  With charmed animals I 
could target a mob that was a lot further away, hit attack, and the charmed 
animal would take off and go attack.  With my summoned pet though he just sits 
there unless I'm closer.  Is there any hope?

One last question.  Can a Shaman pet dual wield?
