I play EQ in half screen mode to; no colorblindness, just like it
that way.  All the things I need to concentrate on visually are isolated
in a relatively small area of the screen, and I don't have to shift focus
back and forth between "behind the text" and the text or health bars
or anything of that nature.

I'm partially crippled by this decision, of course, since I'm forced
to look at the little art display for my class (middle left side) which
conveys no useful information at all, and don't get access to all
my potential hot keys; all my banks of hotkeys are only six buttons
deep instead of the ten that full screen viewers get.

When I started playing, this wasn't an option, nor was the full screen
mode as configurable as it is now.  This means that when I was
making the choice as to what mode to play in, there were -no- disadvantages
to partial screen mode.

I've tried to force myself to switch, but I just can't do it.  If Luclin
doesn't allow me to use partial screen, I don't know what I'll do,
finally switch, refuse to install Luclin, or quit the damn game entirely.
