Your str sucks because you're a high elf. :p Something to learn,
though, str is far from being the most important stat for a cleric,
and it's fairly easy to find str boosting gear if you really have that
much trouble with it. Don't worry about being a wimp, you're not
exactly a melee class (though clerics CAN melee and some have been
known to do so, you're usually best off healing, stunning, pacifying,
and medding).
