Actually my own experience with wireless networks is slightly
different, I get approx 4.5 Mbps, using the 11Mps cards and a 3Com
Access point which bridges onto my 100BaseT network, but even if the
card is 2 feet away from the access point I cant get anywhere near the
11Mbps quoted speed.

Funnily enough the range and quality of the link using 2Mbps cards is
better than the 11Mps cards, and yes using the 2Mbps cards you do only
get about 1.6Mbps, compared to about 86Mbps per second on my 100BaseT
.. quite a difference.

Wireless networking in the home is more hit and miss than within the
office environment as well, maybe it's the brick walls.

Definitley useful to have but for your main machine go with Cat5e
100BaseT if u can.  A small switch can be had for around 50 pounds
(UK), definitely better than a hub.

Just my 2 pence worth, email me if u want more details.
