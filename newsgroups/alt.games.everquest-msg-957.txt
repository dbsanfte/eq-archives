An increase from 12 - 20% isn't piddly.  What do you think is fair...100%?
Why do you think Nurga and Droga are only being increased 12%?  Couldn't it
be that the xp there was already better than in the dungeon that's getting a
20% boost?  I don't know...I think it's a possibility though.

I think your opinion that folks won't go to the dungeon with a 20% modifier
boost is a bit incorrect.

Anyway, go to FM.
