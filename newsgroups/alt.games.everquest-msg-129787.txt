Here is the link you were hoping to see.
http://eq.castersrealm.com/menu/research.asp

You will see that there are three ways to increase skill in research.
1.  Pay for practice from a trainer.
2.  Combine Words (if you are Necro) or the other items if you are another
of the "pure casters".
3.  Combine the practice runes that you or someone else made.  Note here:
You do not have to be a caster to create the runes.  You just have to have
the Concordance of Research.

Further note:  The practice runes are identical for all the casters.
