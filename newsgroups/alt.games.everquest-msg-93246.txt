Would help to know specifically what the error message you are getting
is. However, it's likely one of two: either it's saying it doesn't
recognize the account key number, or it's saying that the key is already
in use.

If it's the latter, (key in use) you need to talk to/e-mail customer
service immediately and get on the horn with them. I had that problem
with one of our copies, and they wound up providing me with a new
account key after I proved I had bought the game.

If it's just not recognized, then you've tried most of the stuff I would
suggest. The old Kunark discs used a VERY funky font for printing out
the account key labels, and many had trouble with them. (been changed
since then.) So DOUBLE-double check all the zeros and o's, "L's" and
number ones, "B's" and number eights, etc.  In the end, you may have to
scan a picture of your CD key and send it to them. Then they can either
tell you the correct number, or e-mail you a new one to use. If you have
a scanner, you may want to do that in advance just to be ready. If you
have one ready to fire off to somebody's e-mail *while* you are on the
phone with them, you may come to a surprisingly rapid fix.
