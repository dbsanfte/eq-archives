HOWEVER, note that the lower-level character requires
less experience to level (or get a blue/yellow bubble of
exp), and given that the exp-per-level is not linear
by level, whereas the split is (almost), the good news
is that low-level folks in a group actually get bigger
"chunks" of exp than they would have under an "equal bubble"
plan (like used to be the case before the big experience
revamp patch).

In other words, the low-level members of the group
will make blue bubbles of exp faster than the higher-level
members of the group.  Over time, they'll narrow the
gap between themselves and the high-level folks they
group with.  Think of it as a slow form of powerleveling.

In "the old days", every member of the group, regardless
of level, made exactly the same number of bubbles of exp
per grouping session.  Now, the lower-level folks get
a boost, sometimes a pretty big one.  I've been in
very mismatched groups (like 56 with 38) where I (the
56) have gotten barely a blue, whereas the 38 got well over
a yellow.  In the old method of exp splitting, I'd have sucked
up more of the exp to the point where I'd have gotten, say,
1.5 blues, and so would the low-level person.  I like the
new method better, it doesn't slow me down a lot, but
really helps my lower-level guildmates make some progress
towards catching up.
