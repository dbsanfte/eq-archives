Pay Sony twice as much as a single account.

Play EQ and two machines at the same time.

and um ... Pay twice as much ... darn already done that one.

Really I cant think of anything else to say about owning 2 accounts, I have
2 and other than costing twice as much its no different, yes transfers are
way easier and you can be pretty sure your alt isnt going to run off with
your hand over gear and CR are a breeze with a Cleric on one account and a
Necro on another but thats not really a "helpful tip".

If you want self grouping tips I hear SK and shammys make a good team.
