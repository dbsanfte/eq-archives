52 levels of not having to do it.

I've had good XP in PoD fighting the Bulks, but pretty slow XP fighting the
goo and rats.  We had trouble sticking slow on them as well (and no
chanter), but in our case it got hairy each time because the mob would then
try and eat the shaman, tank couldn't regain aggro quickly, shaman was busy
trying to heal himself, couldn't heal tank, etc., etc.

I still find kill rate more important than overall xp per mob (mainly
because it also keeps my interest up).
