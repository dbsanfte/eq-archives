I don't really have a problem with the locked combat system, it means no
kill stealing, and i can feel pretty safe when a mass of beasties run by
that I won't be mabbited. As far as soloing goes, questing gives bulk xp at
low levels, and that might mean kill really easy mobs or go on postal
rounds. I don't think quests in eq1 ever gave the relatively awesome items
eq1 did. If anything that's a complaint amongst tradeskillers, who feel
their items can't compete with the quest items.

However, I would say that you are right about it not working as a solo game,
unless you like crafting. There is multiplayer interaction however. I joined
with others to help them finish quests i'm not involved in, can't benefit
from etc, or answer things in ooc if i can, and have been helped by others
with no possible benefit to them. If anything, i think that they should
encourage grouping by allowing you to share quests like i am told you can in
WoW.

I have lots of gripes about this game... no offline trading, being kicked
after an hour in merchant mode if i use najena instead of antonia bayle for
no apparent reason, inadequate testing of code before release... but there's
community interaction, you can explore zones that are grey to you without
being nagged by skeletons and orc pawns ala EQ1 (it's fun to see undead
cower, it makes me giggle), and i think that it could get better. Remember,
if they see one feedback, they won't act, but hundreds all saying "more solo
stuff please!" would carry weight. Heck, guilds could create a form letter!

There are other things that concern me, some quite serious, but i decided to
renew my subscription for a bit. I find it amusing that they have now
released the manual. It would have helped to have everyone reading from the
same rulebook from the start.

It's like an election. Get enough votes one way or another, and they'll go
your way. They want your custom.

Hope this patch helps.
