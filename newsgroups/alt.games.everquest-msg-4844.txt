The nearest ranger guild to Freeport is in Kithicor, nearby the entrance to
Rivervale. Enter at night at your own risk.

Freeport does not have a ranger's guild because the people of that city are
uncouth and uncivilized. You can find most of your fletching supplies in
East Commonlands, however. Go to the so-called "hidden inn," which lies
between the two orc camps along the northern zone line. A ranger who does
not fletch is not a ranger, says I.
