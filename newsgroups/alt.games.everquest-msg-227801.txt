Well, I wouldn't disagree with what you're saying, but for an end user with
typical home-user sensibilities and knowledge, I'll admit my bias is against
recommending systems built my unknown third parties because of the support
issue. As I've been building my own systems for many years, I've completely
lost track of that market so I still tend to recommend the major dealers who
compete with each other largely on the basis of support. My wife is a buyer
for a small private school and she swears by the support she gets from
Gateway. I don't think I would think I would choose that company myself but
I can't argue with the track record I hear her describe.

I'm in Redmond, Washington. Lots of computing activity around here. ;-) If
you're aware of any good reliable system builders that you can recommend,
with some longevity behind and ahead of them, let me know, please, and I'll
pass this information on to my wife as well.

I am a nerd, and I don't know! That's what I'm afraid of, an uninformed
nerd's opinion. ;-) It's easy for someone like me to spout off on the
superiority of home-built solutions. But with a couple of kids at the local
University who both depend on dad as their primary Help Desk, I know what it
means to provide support. It's a pain in the ass for the supporter and
supportee and the variability on this issue far exceeds (in my experience)
the variability the I see in intrinsic hardware quality. So I see support as
the primary issue when I make these recommendations.

You're right, that was poorly worded. What I really meant is that the
demands of EQ are high, not so much in terms of pushing the feature limits
of the technology, but in pushing the performance limits (e.g., geometry
processing power as you mentioned). Anyone standing around PoK during an MGB
or strolling the Bazaar can attest to this, and it's my feeling that
upgrading RAM and the video card are probably going to deliver the most
visible upgrade to this system.
