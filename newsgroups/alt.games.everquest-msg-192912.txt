And you know it doesn't...  how?

By the way, there are rumors of a coming change to a 9-man possible group
circulating among people that went to the last Fanfair.

4 people group.  Each gets 1/4 of the exp of a mob (plus a bonus).  6 people
group.  Each gets 1/6 of the exp of a mob (plus a bonus).
