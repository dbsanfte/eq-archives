I apologize, Celaeno, if it sounded like I was clinging to a
definition. :)

You're right that this is off the subject. I've just read so many
times the phrase "I've invested blah blah blah amount of time" and I
just finally had to say something.

My point (unclear as it was) was that many people use that term with
the tone that they're going to get something back other than what the
game actually offers.

Many times I've seen the declaration along the lines of:

"I've invested 3 months into raising my character to a high enough
level to do the magic spoon quest and another week to do the d***
thing and now I find out it's broken. I've contacted a lawyer and I'm
suing Verant."

It just really sticks a bug up my rear.

Sorry for jumping on you, Sui.

I promise, no more on the subject from me.
