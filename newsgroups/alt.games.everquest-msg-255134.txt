I find it amusing that you refer to loot as "raid awards".
Ever hear of *quests* or *rare drops* that require days of farming in a
single group or solo? I guess not.

You seem to think the casual players want something for nothing, or thats
how your post sounds to me.
Go do the coldain prayer shawl and then you might understand whats missing
from eq nowadays.

ps: Im in a raiding guild, and raiding is what I like doing. At least I can
see theres more to the game.
