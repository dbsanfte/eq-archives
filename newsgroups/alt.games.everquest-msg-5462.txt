Pets can be lifesavers or lifelosers.  As an SK, I never use my pet in a
group as he is too green and aggroes alot of wandering greens.  Also, I'm in
there meleeing and can't watch him as closely (totally irrelevant to a mage)

For a mage, what others have said works great.  Just keep an eye on him as
he will break mez and get you to the bottom of your enchanters "people to
group with" list.

If he is really out of control hitting all the wrong things, you should
group on some easy mobs, where screw ups aren't as big a deal.

Everyone has to go thru the learning process, so don't feel bad if you
aren't a whiz at controlling the pet... you'll get there.
