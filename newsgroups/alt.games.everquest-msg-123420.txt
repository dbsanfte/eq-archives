I don't know where persuasion came into it. What I said is that there is no 
absolute right or wrong, only "what is the best course of action under the 
present circumstances", or what it comes to in most cases, chosing the 
lesser evil.

Don't get me wrong, I have passionately held views of what's right and wrong 
(hell, I've been a vegetarian for twelve years now for purely ethical 
reasons). I simply don't entertain any illusions that I'm so wise that my 
standards apply to every person, everywhere and at all times.

I wouldn't know, I'm not religious.
