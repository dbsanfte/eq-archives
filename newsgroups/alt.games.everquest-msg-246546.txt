Wow!  Even my Cleric has his bind wounds at max.

And the first item I tracked down for my "baby" Beastlord, now lev 32,
was an Embalmers skinning knife to proc summon bandages while I was
fighting.  I always wanted one and it was a higher priority for me than a
cheap haste item at the time.  My new beastlord (lev 11) already has maxed
his bind wounds skill each level.  I always bind before casting heals, even
when at FOM.

I just assumed everyone did bind wounds.  <oops>
