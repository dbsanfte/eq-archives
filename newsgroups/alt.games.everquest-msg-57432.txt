Hi Mark,

I went to XP recently and have had no problems. Well, at least not until I
downloaded the XP drivers from Creative's site for my SBLive!. Now I get no
sound, although I had sound with the drivers XP loaded on install.

Other than rolling back the drivers (which I will consider soon), got any
advice?

Thanks,

Lefty
