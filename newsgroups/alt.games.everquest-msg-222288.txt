Wood elf is my guess. Not familiar with ranger quests in your home area.

About the only one I can think of that may be worth doing is turning in
Greater Light Stones to the gypsy in the Karanas gypsy camp. Good experience
and you make ~9 pp selling the book she gives you in exhange for the GLS.
Experience killing wisps at level 15 will be kind of meager.

There are a lot of quests starting out of Surefall.

You can build faction by having the Millers convert low, medium, high,
quality bear and wolf pelts into armor. The Medium bear pelt actually gets
you a focus item, extended enhancement boots which are pretty good.

There's a quest that will net you a +5 charisma neck amulet.

Various poacher heads turned into the guildmaster will get you some faction
but not much else.

Gnoll teeth from Blackburrow can be turned in to Captain Tillin<sp?> who
gives you exp, faction, and moonstones. The moonstones can be turned into a
bartender for a Blackburrow Stout and more faction.

Another lousy one is bringing nitrates to a farm in West Karanas. I wouldn't
do that, but if you have PoK you may want to do the following.

Get the nitrates from the guildmaster in the Surefall tree/druid guild.
Sometimes he is just outside the wall, sometimes inside.

Got to Steamfront and smack a lot of Kobolds until you are amiable with the
short people. Downstairs under the city Zoo is a gnome who will exchange the
nitrates for regurgatonic. Take the regurgatonic to West Karanas and feed it
to Frostbite. Frostbite coughs up a fish. Take the fish and give it to the
guy who is usually swimming in the pool in North Qeynos by the temple. Make
sure you are amiable to him. If you are unlucky you will get some prayer
bead with a couple of charges of healing on them. If you are lucky you will
get a ring of Rodcet Life, but not too lucky since it is an int + mana ring
instead of wis + mana like would make sense for a cleric/paladin guild.
