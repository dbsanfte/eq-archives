I do kinda get a laugh when I see the listing for glide drivers. Other
than Quake 1; I'm hard pressed to find a program in my library that
even uses the old glide standard anymore. I've never owned a card that
supported it, heck I had to go out and buy one of those add-on 8meg 3D
accelerator cards. Didn't even bother to move it over to my Pent IV.

The again, the retro graphics do allow them to have a larger costumer
base so maybe from their standpoint, it's a good graphic engine.
