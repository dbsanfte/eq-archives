I think your problem is your video card.

The maker of your card, 3Dfx is out of business. They have not updated
drives in a long time. The latest patch went beyond the abilities of the
driver software. I have a Voodoo 3 3500TV. I can get into the game but the
graphics are screwed up. I called tech support. They sent me a program to
try and fix the registry, but id did not work. I am trying to find any one
who may be writting drivers for 3Dfx cards on their own. Otherwise, we may
both need to buy new video cards.
