   Be glad to.  But people do need something to 
work with.  Be vague, get back answers you might
not be looking for.

   I'm married in EQ.  Specifically,  Tealeef the Barbarian 
is married to Lennaman the Troll, as played by my real life
husband Steven, who sometimes posts to this newsgroup as
"Lord Lenny".  It was a lovely ceremony, performed by a 
guide, and attended by about a dozen guests, some of whom
are
regular posters to this newsgroups.  Our in-game last 
name is Benlen.  No kids yet, but Tealeef is looking forward
to her first Barbarian-Troll son or daughter (I haven't 
told her that that might be a long time in coming).
   You're welcome in advance for this info on an EQ Wedding.
