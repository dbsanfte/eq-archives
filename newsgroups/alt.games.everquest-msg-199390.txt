When I started playing, my druid hunted in Orc highway groups from 15
to 19, dressed in patchwork and using a bronze scimitar, a cracked
staff and a runed totem staff. Didn't have soe, had very low level
sow, usually only my own buffs. How ever did I make it...

Was usually sand giants that killed me anyway, not adds.
