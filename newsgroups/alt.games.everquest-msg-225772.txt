Well, we used to hold that same camp with a 62 warrior (back when I was
61 and the ranger was 63 or 64).  Also, I've had my air pet tank those
things (level 60, <6k HP buffed out) without too much difficulty.

I still say a 60 warrior can do fine at EW/WW in PoV.  Any problem getting
groups there is due to the number of higher level tanks LFG rather than
an inherent inability to tank the mobs there.
