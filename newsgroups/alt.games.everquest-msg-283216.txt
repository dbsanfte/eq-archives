Anyone else been reading the forums? In particular the $99 Anniversary
Subscription. 9 whole pages of comments. Most are people complaining
about getting shafted, a few are saying they should start a class
action suit, a few quoting the long lost page with the offer and
saying they are going to contact the various fraud agencies, a couple
from Kythrea (sp) saying anymore talk of class action
suit\BBB\Consumer Fraud  will be deleted and possibly the posters'
priveledges suspended.

Pity I don't have an active sub at the moment. I'd just love to stir
things up more. >:)
