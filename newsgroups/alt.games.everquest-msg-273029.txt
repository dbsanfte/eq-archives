Comments on the sub-thread, some of them a bit nitpicky...

Root sucks as runner control for a solo Paladin.  DD procs have an
aannoying habit of breaking roots, giving up our combat innate proc
buffs gimps the crappiest damage output in the game (except maybe
for Clerics) even further.  Stuns are much better, faster casting
and they don't turn the mob back on you, and Paladins get more and
better stuns than any other class.  Unfortunately, chaining stuns
to stop a runner is very mana intensive.  Without KEI (and maybe
tribute FT as well) there's gonna be a lot of downtime involved.

Pacify will work in OS, no need for a careful Paladin to have any
adds working near the ZI.

Dying solo in OS would suck, it's an annoyingly long run from PoK
(binding in FV would save very little time and abandon any hope of
buying KEI and/or Bot9).  10% xp loss looks a lot bigger when you
are xp'ing at Paladin speed.  Wasn't this about completing a solo
"task" that's supposed to be a good way to get xp?  20 minutes
spent on a CR that's gonna end up costing 10% doesn't sound too
good to me.

All in all, OS should be an ok place for a 60 Paladin to solo,
just take care not to get yourself killed.  It'd be way better to
duo with most any other class.

These tasks really are pretty stupid though.  Seeq can do this
one if he decides he wants to, Paladins can solo if they can stand
the glacial pace.  But what if he were a Warrior, Rogue, or Monk?
