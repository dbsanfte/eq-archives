}SOW.

I'm level 56 and don't have Tboots, Jboots, anything like that.  I've spent 
about the last 4 levels in Seb, and 5K still sounds like an incredibly 
heinous amount of money to me.  I dunno how it is everyone who goes to Seb 
gets rich but me, but there it is.  Run Speed 1 will just have to do.
