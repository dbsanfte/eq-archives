Probably from an uber guild, which is what I meant ;)
2 groups from an uber guild of high level people in Uber gear 
is still an Uber guild outing the way I see it. It very likely is not
a pick up group of 12 or more people from Seb who suddenly decide to
go and do Tov.

You being guildless won't be going to TOV going "55 warrior looking
for a group."

I was in ToV with my semi uber guild in the off hours for a normal
raid for us so it was only about 4 groups or less.. but its still an
uber guild thing. The people you are with are in an uber guild and
have the uber guild gear and would not be doing Tov otherwise.
