I had the greatest experience the other day! I banged my head on a desk
for about three hours, then when I stopped, it felt SO good! As such, I
have requested to my employer that once a week everyone be made to bang
their head on a desk just so they can realise how good it feels when
they stop.

Just because people have done it, doesn't make it fun, and certainly
doesn't make it valuable. Sense heading has always been a needlessly
sadistic and pointless skill, and people should be rejoicing at it's
removal, not saying that everyone should have to bang their head on a
desk just because they did.
