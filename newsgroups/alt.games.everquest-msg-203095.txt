 I love grouping, but it would seem my xp bard wouldn't even budge.  Luckily
my main is a bard and my most played alt is a necro, so I could solo
occasionally to rack up a bit of xp when no group was to be found or not
much time to find one.
Logged on last night to see what the new xp bonus for grouping was
like......
WOW!!!!
First my buddy and I grouped together and were quite impressed.  Decided to
/ooc to join a group and got into a full group.

OMFG!!!

I'll never solo again...

Sean...
