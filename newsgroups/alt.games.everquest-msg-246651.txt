The issue is principles. If Sony made you disable your antivirus, 
firewall, and unlock your car doors as part of the beta application 
would you think they were being terribly bright??

Even though we all agree the beta application itself is very likely to 
be perfectly safe its beyond stupid to require your users to make 
completely unnecessary security concessions in order to use it.

There was no reason whatsoever to require us to use IE or activeX. It 
really didn't even make their lives easier... a simple normal downloaded 
program to run us through the application would have been easier to 
write and less hassle to use...
