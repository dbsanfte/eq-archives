CoE will *not* stack with FoN.  It will, however, stack with all skin
buffs, all cleric buffs, and the paladin line of devil buffs (brells).
Interestingly, it *will* stack with the ranger self only Warders
Protection (combo of CoE, SoN, CotP, and a DS).  Also, normally the
ranger can't cast CoE on the newb.  The shaman's benefactor here had
one of the Velious quest breastplates with clicky CoE.
