I'd probably suggest a half-elf Ranger starting in Qeynos.
Simple, easy to start with warrior type and you get the bonus of the
tracking skill which lets you find mobs to fight quite easy.

Plus, as mentioned, you start getting spells at level 9 and that will let
you try out spell casting before you try and make a pure Caster character.

Also, I'm biased.  <lol>
Qeynos is my favourite city and newbie zone area in the game with
the low level Gnoll dungeon nearby and close access to Everfrost
(Barbarian snow & Ice zone) and the plains of Karanas for higher
level hunting.

If you start on Saryn server please post your new char race/class/name
and I'll drop by with my Cleric/Shaman/Magician/Ranger/etc. <heh> to
say hello and give you some starting off help.
I also have low level characters on The Rathe, Tribunal, and my soloist
Magician on Firiona Vie but I don't recommend FV server to new players.
