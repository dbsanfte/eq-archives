Guess what? The numbers there are EXACTLY THE SAME. A typical quad
empties my mana pool from full. Have you EVER played a druid? Done a
lot of quadding with one? Quadding is most definately not all it's
cracked up to be. In fact, a typical quad empties my mana before it's
done, meaning it turns into a med-kite. Yes, I have 200 wis.

Plus, the quads typically take a LOT more than 5 minutes. If I'm
quadding something that I can take down all 4 of in 5 minutes, then
it'd be faster xp to root-rot something bigger one at a time.

Again, you're talking like someone who's never quad kited before. Quad
kiting is usually only feasable on low blues.... And you are aware
that you can fire an arrow and flick a root off during the recycle
time with a lot of bows and barely miss a beat, right? Oh, and firing
while running backwards is handy, too, if the mob's too close for you
to have time to get root off. You sound like you're so set in a
specific pattern, you're crippling yourself.
