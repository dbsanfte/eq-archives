I'll second this. In EQ, once I got past lvl 15 or so, I pretty much
never soloed. In DAoC as a Necromancer, I could solo all the way to 50
but it wasn't a ton of fun. That class is way overpowered for PvE in
the game. CoH seems to be about perfect. While grouping is preferable,
solo can be done but quite difficult. Missions are scaled to number of
folks in the group (or lack thereof).
