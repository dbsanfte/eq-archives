LOL it's probably true that it still got flooded. Gamers are a dedicated
bunch aren't we? Still, I don't remember it being down all night, I bet it
was down for less time. I remember that I forgot all about the start time
and then read a message in the rpg newsgroup that the beta signups had
begun, so I wandered over and filled out the app. I'm pretty sure it was
within a couple of hours of the signups starting and was definitely the same
day.
