Wow - awesome concept. This could be expanded in sooooo many different ways:

    -Level 65 Death Touching patroll all zones under the world till they
detect a Halfling Druid above, upon which they dig through and devour said
Halfling Druid.

    -"Sow plz" become a magical keyword for instant teleportation to a spot
in the air roughly 200 ft above the centre of the Hole in Painheel.

    -"Butt Plug Fungus" mobs to spawn under any player character who sits
down for too long to meditate (this timespan would be considerably less for
Ogres) . The effect would be a cross between "Root" and "Banshee Aura". The
message would read "You are tormented by a root up the butt"....

    -Reverse Track. Cut the legwork out of the tracking skill. As soon as
someone hits the <track> button, every mob in the zone becomes aggro and
makes a beeline to the tracker.

    -Critical Hides. The character attempting to hide stays perfectly
visable but all the mobs in the zone turn invis instead. They then file in
an organised fashion and line up 3 deep at the zone line to await the next
person inbound.

    -Reverse Critical Hits. Every time a warrior scores a critical hit, they
run the chance of scoring a reverse critical. Upon encountering a reverse
critical, all their armour flies off to the ground over a 90 foot radius and
there weapons are transfered to the mob they are fighting.

Wow - once you have one good idea - the rest just flow so easily!
