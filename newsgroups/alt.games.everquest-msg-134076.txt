I have another besides Dan's. I am colorblind to a couple colors. I
have, in the last month, *finally* switched over to full screen, as I
was told that it would be the only option with the new interface, and I
figured I'd better get used to it. The number of colors that I can
clearly see on any given background, however, is fairly limited. The
shifting background colors of a semitransparent chat screen were making
my text often invisible. The only choice I found usable was to make the
chat background totally opaque and black. This works fine for reading
the chat, but also wipes out part of the bottom of my screen.
Personally, I'd do with a little less vertical view and be able to
shrink it up above my chat box and not have part of the view blocked
out.
