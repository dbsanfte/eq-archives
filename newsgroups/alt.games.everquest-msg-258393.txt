I routinely pull mobs off clerics and other casters in PoP zones.  I do 
so with slow, so, even if the mob does not agro on me at first, at least 
he is smacking the other person a lot less frequently.  For xp/trash 
mobs, I can generally keep myself healed just fine with the mob smacking 
me once it's slowed.
