Have to remember, best class to solo, is a tricky question. There is a
boredom issue involved, as well as brain exercise.  Sure a necro can
fear kite, but what do you do in luclin zones where things are
*immune* to fear?  Oh, no solo necros.

I prefer mage. There is something that gives a thrill from having 3
mobs on your damage shielded pet, all beating themselves to death.
Sending some pretty major nukes in finish them off. Walking away with
60% mana, and taking more time to loot the corpses than it took to
kill them. when pet dies mage dies unless can channel gate.

Druid root dot = boreing. you aren't saving yourself anytime, because
the mob gonna take 2 minutes to die anyways.  Druid quad kiting = fun
fun fun, but can't do it inside or with casters. And fun wears off
pretty fast. don't start at 34 as people suggest, wait until can do
some big stuff so won't burn yourself on it too fast. Had a "blast"
doing it.

Never played a shaman

Never played a monk, but best monks are ones who have one as thier
main. twink monks = bad idea and attitude.  And nothing screams twink
monk than having a last name "Corpse"

Shadow knight, awesome solo up to 30 before I gave up and deleted it.
Again have to rely on fear kiting to get serious

Never played a ranger but here they get the shaft a lot

Never palyed wiz, but duo quaded my druid with one. Never felt so
worthless in my life.

Saw a bard quading something. Or maybe was just running around in a
cricle foir fun. at any rate he was doing pretty good for killing
yellows/reds.

Enchanter, don't even think about it. sure can sometimes charm
something to kill something else, but get realistic. 

Cleric. If its undead and blue its toast. No contest. Never lost
against a blue undead with my cleric. soloed off and on from 42 to 49
in dreadlands

Never played paladin but hear they complain a lot

Warrior. Ha

Rogue's can solo?
