The arrows were from the mobs original loot not from bow using players
shooting at it.

They could save space on the disks by dumping a ton of stuff that

You would still be able to do that. Its just an optional thing.
The first thing i think most people to when they hit the bank is conver all
their low denomination coins to pp for weight and ease of telling how much
total money you have. Just trying to turn 8 clicks into just one. =)

I have had situations where people were anon and joined a group that
was much lower, thus sucking up exp.

Happens all the time. NPC names are similar, item names are similar, items
given stacked when they should be separate. Yes as a veteran EQ player I
always double check everything but this can frustrate newbies. I know it did
when I was new.

And people think 'man this is a stupid game' and move on. *shrug* its a simple
'user friendly' thing to do.

I am so sick of having games screwed up and made frustrating and a pain
in the ass to stop 'some' people from cheating and exploiting. We have LORE
and NO DROP shit to put up with because of farmers. We have linkdeaths
causing exp loss on death because people 'might' pull the plug because of
iminent death.

Besides a few seconds is hard to exploit, this would only be on zone in anyway
and only until you got control.

ASAP, as soon as their aggro list is clear. Guards do this, why not shopkeepers
and bankers?

Should be simple, you can page with the shift-arrow keys now.
This is not as big a deal since i have a wheel mous and scolling the
text  window is easy now.

My character is meditating not me.

Yes they use that excuse all the time, when its convienient, and ignore
RPing when they want game design/balance things. Either is fine just stick to
one or the other.

I play in high resolution. Plenty of room. =)

I don't understand why it would take that much over head. The game has to
load the new zone and objects into memory right? Just show a progress of
that.

Clicking on those tiny arrows to change pages is such a pain, especially
in the heat of battle. The only other way to change panels is to use a shift-#
key combination. Which you have to do with one hand since the other hand
is usually on the mouse.

Good point, use a different key than / or use quotes maybe.

I use those keys but they are not reliable, I stopped playing my enchanter
to to all the problems I had targeting things. It just got too frustrating to die
because I couldn't target the right thing.

Make the client do it. you have to download the item data for the right click
anyway.

That is charmed. If its mezzed it is bascally a long stun. Many time due to
lag and distance I can visually see the mob but not the PC.

You but a snareed mob that is chasing someone looks just like its normal walk.
Happens all the time in Rathe Mtns with HGs.

If something is dotted you can't see how much damage is on something unless
you are very close to it. Happens all the time.

So? Store it on my computer, its not like its critical info to be hacked.

Just to have a variety of use for weapons. Why have a 1hb 12/23 when you can have
a 12/22 1hs? All high level characters look the same all the time. Everyone finds
what the best weapon is and gets that. Allthough I have to say this has gotten
better with the new expansion packs. Remember when EVERY melee character
had SSOY?

No I spent 6 pp when I was a newb making a pole once to have it freakin'

Hard to do when you are dead somewhere there aren't any wisps or
fire beetles. Hard to kill a wisp with out your weapons anyway =)

This really struck me as odd when my druid was waiting at the entrance
to Unrest once and I had 2 naked barbarians and a human ask me for
a light source so they could get their bodies back one day. All I could do
was buff them and lead them around. *shrug* MAges can give their wispstone
away why not other casting classes?

Yes, that is an exception. But you have to admit there are spells you never
cast again once you get the upgrade right? There are tons of spells in this
game, but I suggest that only about 20% are ever used consistently.

I lost an item to a quest once. I turned it in to the right person but never
got the reward. I petitioned it and got basically the answer of 'tough shit'
no way to prove it.' Huh? I had done the quest previously and
again and got the reward.

Record who struck the mob first. More than one instance of course.

Not that I know of. As far as I know its just who does the most damage.

Would have to be a new game probably. SoW and teleports are too ingrained
into the structure of EQ. Travel should not be a 'spell' or ability of only a few
classes. Running should be like swimming, every character should have a skill
to move faster as they increase in levels.

No just add wood and branch drops to Treants. =)
Besides there is various wood items that vendors can sell like
the ore for smithing. The higher quality woods could be mob drops
like the higher quality ore drops are now.

No it should be relatively easy, like sense heading skill.
How hard would it be for a character to draw a freaking map?

Difficult only to raise to get more esoteric functions, like location
markers and land marks, secret doors, etc. But a basic map just
to have a few major lines just to be able to get around a little easier
would be nice addition to the game.

Read it again. Leveling would take the exact same amount of time.
It would be just less boring. Halve the experience and double the med/heal
times. I don't mind leveling taking a long time I just don't want to pay $10
a month to spend my time staring at a static screen. Bad design plain and
simple. Only reason EQ is so popular is because nothing else even comes
close. Plus I have played the other games and the downtime issue is the same
or worse. Hello? Is it really that hard to figure out? People sign up
and pay to PLAY a game! What a freaking shock!

The whole secret to the popularity of RPGs is one simple thing: PROGRESS
You progress in skills
You progress in attributes
You progress in levels
You progress in hit points
You progress in areas to explore
You progress in items acquired
You progress in money collected
You progress in quests completed
You progress in factions and reputations raised
You progress from a level one wimp that gets his ass kicked by a rat
to a level xx uber hero that is taking on dragons and gods!

So why hamper that sense of play and progress by having long pauses
in the game where NOTHING happens.

Don't get me wrong I love this game but I hate it when I have to sit
around in it 'waiting' to play it.

You wait for your mana to come back
You wait for your hit points to regen
You wait for the boat
You wait for a port
You wait for someone to buy an item you want to sell
You wait for a LD group member to come back
You wait for a raid to get organized and started
You wait for a rez when the raid goes bad =)
You wait for a friend or guild/group member to get to where you are to hunt
You wait for some mob to spawn
You wait for some item to spawn on the ground
etc etc etc

Yes I know some of these are unavoidable, however many of them can
be improved or reduced quite a bit.

Sorry rant mode off. =)
