No they won't. I bought EQ Gold edition from Game (a shop in the EB chain
here in the UK) after having started playing EQ from a magazine cover disc
and thinking getting the complete game with expansions was a good idea :-)
Only to find that someone had used all the codes - I emailed customer
service and was told that the only way was to take the game back to the shop
and tell them (they can't give out fresh codes for obvious reasons). Of
course on the plus side it proved a long held suspicion that Game staff put
the returned boxes right back on the shelf :-)
