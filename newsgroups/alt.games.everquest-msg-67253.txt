I KNOW you can't be saying something as stupid as EQ is camp kill kill kill
and that DAOC is any better.    DAOC:
camp...kill...rest...kill...rest...kill...rest...stop getting anti-camping
bonus
run to the next camp (5-10 mins)
camp...kill...rest...kill...rest...kill...rest...stop getting anti-camping
bonus

So, how's that different than EQ?

What is there to do in DAOC?  Let's see...

Tradeskills.  Done MUCH better than EQ but boring as all hell (as boring as
EQ) unless you have some good music cranking.
Kill critters.
Be killed by other players until 30+
Kill other players once you reach 30, avoiding higher level players.

Do *cough* quests.  You're told who to go to, what to say, what to kill,
then go back for your prize.  Average quest time: 30 minutes.
Mini-quests (tasks).  You go to any NPC, type /say task, and either are told
that they have none for you (at which point you just go to the next  NPC) or
they hand you something and have you run 5-10 minutes to give that item to
another NPC.

I don't like having my hand held that much.  EQ-lite.
