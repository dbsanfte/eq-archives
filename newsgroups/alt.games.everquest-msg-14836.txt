Is seems to me that Verant's customer service is becoming more and more
useless. They claim that they are trying to be more responsive and helpful,
but in realty, it appears to be quite the reverse. They come up with all
these situations where they won't help a player out. Why not? Most of the
situations where they refuse to help have nothing to do with game balance
which is a concept they always try to hide behind. I just finished reading
their reimbursement policy and, excuse my language, it's a crock of shit! I
am not bitching because I was refused help at all. Fortunately, I've never
needed to call for help for anything less than a known bug. Hell, even then
I normally don't get the help I need.

The point? I think more people need to start bitching at VI and get them off
their lazy asses and do what WE PAY THEM TO DO.

Personally, if things don't get better, they can kiss my ass and both my
accounts goodbye, especially with all the cool games that are coming
out soon and will surely be followed by more and more that will remove EQ as
the only show in town.

I really hope someone at VI reads this and takes it to heart. This is a
sincere complaint and not just a mad rant because I got screwed out of
something because I didn't... YET.
