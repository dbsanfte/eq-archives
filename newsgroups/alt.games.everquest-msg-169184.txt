Spelling things weird is not roleplaying, since /say and /tell represent
spoken words, not written words.

I've never played a low INT or WIS character to high enough level for it to
matter, but I've wondered what I'd do if I did and was trying to roleplay.

For example, suppose I had a low INT Warrior, and was leading a party
through a dungeon.  In real-life, I'd have a map of the dungeon printed out,
so there would not be much chance of getting lost.  If roleplaying, would it
be OK to take into account my character's low INT, and occasionally
purposefully make the character lead the party down the wrong path?
