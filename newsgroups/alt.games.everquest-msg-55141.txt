Well put, Jazz.  Necros are great.  I'm fairly new to the game (mid-summer I
said "Fuck You!" to the sun, went inside and installed EQ) and started a
necro.  After awhile, I wanted to try a couple other characters and was
extremely disappointed.  I do like my enchanter and my ranger, but the necro
is my favorite, mainly since it can solo great.  My wife works at night and
I'm sometimes playing while being "Mr. Mom" so joining a group isn't fair to
the other group members if I have to bolt once in awhile.  Kill something,
wipe a nose, kill something, break up a battle, etc.
Occasionally I mezz the kids with television.  It's rather powerful and the
mezz doesn't even break when they are attacked.
In groups necros are pretty good too.  Wait until you hit lvl 24 and get a
damn good DD poison spell!  You get a good upgrade to dark pact at 20 too.
2 necros are good in a group, but you really have to discuss who's casting
what so you don't cast likewise spells on the mob.  Waste of mana, ya know.
Unfortunately, and this is not from experience, but from what I have read
necros lose a lot of their edge at high levels.  Damn, I wish I had tried
this game before all the nerfing I've heard so much about.  I will still
plug away at it though  :-)

 Keep at it.  Necros are fun!
