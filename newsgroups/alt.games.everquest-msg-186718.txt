    Oh, I know the name could be based off Frank Zappa. But frankly (no pun
intended), a dead singer that was never terribly popular even when he was
alive isn't what I'd call a sterling example of a name begging for banning.
If I saw someone named "Grimaldi" I wouldn't assume he was named after the
royal family of Monaco, for example. It's even more tenuous in this case
because "Zappa" may be a minor alteration of "Zapper", the sort of name a
nuker might pick. As I said above, unless the last name made the reference
really obvious (Zappa Motherofinvention, say) I can't see a GM asking him to
change it.
