Even if the standards of public education aren't anywhere near where 
they should be, when you consider the number of parents who would choose 
home schooling because they, in fact, are better educated than the 
teachers, compared with the number of parents who would choose home 
schooling because they want to teach their children that the Earth was 
created around 4000BC, I think I'd settle for mandatory public schooling 
as the lesser evil.
