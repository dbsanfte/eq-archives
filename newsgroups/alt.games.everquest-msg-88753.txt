I made several changes at the same time as this file came out, so I
can't say with certainty.

I turned off all the detailed models (because, as nice as they were I
realized I'd rather have speed than have everyone around me look
prettier). My old-world zone times have been a consistent 11 seconds
for the last several days. Very easy to live with that! I've yet to
try any Luclin zones.

I also notice that the sounds do indeed seem to be working for me, for
the first time since I loaded Win2k on my system. The music is
stuttering like mad, but I don't care as I don't play with the music
on anyway.
