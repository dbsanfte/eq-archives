I actually think its sad that it seems to be you group with 5 people
to make a full group and you feel like you get more xp per mob than
you did if you took  it out on your own, which, Im sorry but takes
more skill. Especially as you can kill faster in a group.. personally
I think you should get the same xp, so it should take into account
that you're grouped and so if it takes you 20 minutes to solo 3 mobs,
and get say 5 percent xp, the same 20 mobs you may have killed in a
group should get you the same 5 percent xp.. after all, thats probably
the effort lvl you put in. (yeah flame me Im sure, but, if you were
working in your RL job doing the same amount of work as 6 people who
in fact were getting more money for the same amount of effort, wouldnt
you be unhappy?)

Im trying to lvl a toon in echo at the  moment, and like you Im seeing
next to no xp per kill, as an ogre I get a penalty anyway, but, all
the same, thats going bad.
