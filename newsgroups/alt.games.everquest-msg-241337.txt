   I had a similar problem in Shadeweaver's Thicket... any time I
looked up to check out the sky, I got a blur of stars. I quickly ran
to the PoK, no problem there... the sky being screwed up seems to be
zone specific at this point.

Targetting was also horrible for me... it was nearly impossible to
click on a mob. I did like the light up effect on targeted mobs... it
will be very nice once it works.

  As soon as I logged in, I was SO HAPPY I decided to only use my alt
on patch days... XP loss and a CR on a main because the display is
buggy is always a drag.
