I'd have to be horrible out of synch with the server to have it think I was 
anywhere but behind the HG. As a druid, meleeing the last 4% of hp from a hill 
giant takes some time with a shitty weapon like I have, so I was behind him 
swinging for a good 30 or 40 seconds before he died. I'd be in horrible trouble 
if the server didn't know I was still behind him that long after not having moved 
:)
