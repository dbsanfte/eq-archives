Okie dokey.  My ranger(28) is, as I type, sitting in South Karana on
the Wizard/Combine temple thing by all those undead.  He's I'm hidden.
Most of the Skellies are indifferent to him, but some are still
scowling.  All the skellies are green to me.

My hide skill is maxed out.  Why, pray tell, doesn't it work on all
the skeletons?  Does hide only work on certain mobs of a certain
level?  Most stuff that is red to me can't see through it.....
