The chanter really should learn to charm.  A great place to to this is the 
Dreadlands.  I know DL gets a bad rep but the xp is good for both of you and 
it's a great place to work on charm.  Here is what you do.  Chanter finds a 
mob and charms it.  When I did this in DL I didn't bother to tash and the 
charms still held quite nicely.  She can haste the charmed mob if she chooses, 
I always did.  You pull a mob and start tanking it and she sends in the 
charmed mob then slows the one your on.  After slow lands the chanter needs to 
back away from the fight.  In DL there are many pull spots where she can stand 
away from the fight.  When charm breaks the chanter needs to cast her lowest 
level mez which I think is a lvl 4 spell and casts pretty quick.  I've never 
had it resisted and it wears off in like 20 seconds which is more than enough 
time to recast charm.  The mez wears off quickly and the pet is sent back in.  
The best mob to charm in DL around the KC entrance is a Ravishing Drolvarg as 
they hit the hardest.  She may want to gain a couple of levels first but you 
could give them a try now.
