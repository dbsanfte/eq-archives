The thing is, Archery is super duper low aggro anyway AND I'm using
a Blessed faydark thunderbolt. The range is insane. I'm shooting
arrows from further back than the clerics are healing. Totally outside
AOE range for the duration of trueshot. Once that becomes my main 
raid damage deliovery mechanism I'm looking at delivering sustained
undebuffed hasted ATK improved damage for the duration rather than the
fever-click-AOE-junk-replacement-shit-I-got-knocked-back-20000-miles-and
now-I'm-snared sporadic output I do once trueshot drops at the moment.
