When something's attacking me, I'll whip around
to face it, hit F8 to target it, and then immediately
hit the autoattack key.

Note to self:  Don't do this when a bear attacks
me while I'm standing at a vendor.  The vendor
is most likely closer to me than the bear, and
the F8 will target the vendor...

I've done that one a few times.

Also just recently, I was doing the fifth
Coldain Ring stage, which involves spawning
a bunch of killer Orcs near the Garadain
coldain camp.  You have to kill the named one,
loot him, and turn the loot into Garadain.

So we fought down the named one, I looted him,
and then I had two choices:

1.  Run *all* the way to the faraway zone-out
to lose the other Orcs, then run *all* the
way back to Garadain to complete the turn-in, or:

2.  Rush over to Garadain and quickly complete the 
turn-in with killer Orcs running madly around me, 
then book out for the zone.

I opted for #2.

Unfortunately, since I had been doing hit-and-run
fighting with the Orcs, my autoattack was still on,
so when I clicked my quest item on Garadain in order
to hand it to him and that targeted him...

Needless to say, he wasn't pleased.

I ended up running around the zone for a while
with a clump of mobs following me in tight
formation that included the Orcs *and* Garadain --
mortal enemies united in a common purpose for once.

When I finally outran them, the Orcs noticed
Garadain in their midst and ate him.

So I had to wait for him to respawn before I
could complete that quest stage.
