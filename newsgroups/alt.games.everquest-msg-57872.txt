Nope, not possibly in the 40's.

Monks can bandage to 70percent at a skill level of 201+, which is not
possible before level 51.   I haven't used bind wound in the last few
months, so my skill is only 210 - but when healing my girlfs monk, I could
heal her as much as possible in 3 or less bandages.
