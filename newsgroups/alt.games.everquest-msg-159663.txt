Could be all of those things, plus:

1. Now that POP has come out people can easily get to other zones, so maybe
they are checking out places they missed out on.
2. Luclin seems to have developed it's own exp. grind sequence and that is
Paludal to Netherbia/MSaru to Dawnshroud Peaks.  Yes, Dawnshroud is the NEW
Overthere with all the KSing, fussing and feuding in tact so you will feel
right at home.
3. It was Halloween.  It did seem a bit thin last night.

The only thing I really doubt had anything to do with it was that characters
have all advanced to the 50+ level.  There will always be new players and
players starting alts.
