Lol, I got my first few bags from killing orcs as I recall.  Got another 
for some quest or other.

Agreed, I think the complaint is more that people are now off in 
instanced zones instead of in noninstanced areas, but, even that, is not 
really true to a large degree.

It was quite the adventure for my level 9 shaman to make that trip the 
first time.  I did not know the way really, having never been to the 
zones, I had no invis of any type, didn't know about the potions.  I died 
once on the way out there in NK to a griffawn.  I died once on the run 
back at level 14 to a Highland Lion, which was when I first discovered 
that some mobs can ran as fast as SoW.  Nonetheless, it was a blast.

I did not start running into boat issues until well after Velious release 
as I recall.

That was certainly an annoyance, but, I generally was able to find 
someone to bind me, and always offered to bind others.

I remember trying to get in and out of Blackburrow with a torch, you 
still could not see where you were going with my old Voodoo card.
