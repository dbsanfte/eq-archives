Ok, I had to do it, one last response to her:  =)

*************************************************************************


I understand what you are telling me and I still disagree, although
obviously, there's no point.  I'm not sure how many ways I can
misunderstand your comment:

"Now, as to your next issue.  Woe and Envy.  These items are handed in
multiple times in an attempt to get the epic with out completeling the
quest completely and correctly."

Moot point again but it seems pretty clear what you said.

Regardless, I'll live without my epic.  Just a thought for the
designers though.  Wouldn't it be simpler to make the quests linear,
ie have a turn in piece that links every step to very step.  Then
there would be no chance of something like this happening as no steps
could be duplicated without starting completely over and, no matter
how you see it, an honest player losing months of playtime for
nothing.

Thanks for talking with me, considering my point of view, and
reinforcing the beliefs of hundreds of people in newsgroups,
messageboards, and countless other resources that customer
satisfaction really is that unimportant to SOE.
