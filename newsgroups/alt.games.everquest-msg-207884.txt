All valid suggestions, but no- what I have discovered is this:-

Formerly slower mobs (Un-SOWed Sarnaks, Ice Bone and Charbone
Skellies, Iksar Exiles and Goblin Battlemasters etc) are now as fast
as Sabertooth Tigers. These can no longer be out run without some form
of speed buff (bard or otherwise)
Tigers havent changed, these used to cause me some problems with mixed
pulls, as it is that bit more difficult to herd mobs of different
speeds.
Faster MOBS (SOWed Sarnaks and Goblin Agressors) are FASTER than level
23 Bard speed (Selo's Accelerando obviously) UNLESS I switch to drum
(or tambourine in my case)

This is soloing, with no buffs but my own, stood up, not walking, less
than half encumbered (ie no speed penalties at all)

I dont know if this is server specific (Antonius Bayle) or zone
Specific (LOIO) but it is certainly not what it was before the patch.
