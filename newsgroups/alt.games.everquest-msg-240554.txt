*shrug* I've always had my petitions taken care of within a few days
at most. Biggest thing I've petitioned about was to restore a deleted
character, and had that within a few hours of petitioning. Gotta keep
at it, though, if it's not taken care of within a day. Petitions
expire after a certain amount of time, and some require the GM to
actually contact you in-game. If you're not online when they get your
petition, they can't do anything in those cases.

Anyway...all it takes is persistence.
