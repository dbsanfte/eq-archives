That is because you are setting the MODE it will work in. You choose
between what the old /hitsmode command will register. You are filtering
the contents of the 'hitsmode' data, but unless you actually filter the
'window' to show that data, you won't see those contents

That is because 'melee' is a window filter. Choosing 'my hits' here
means 'show contents of hitsmode'

Though they are named the same, their hierarchy is different:

Melee --> My hits filter
is not the same as
Hitsmode --> My hits
