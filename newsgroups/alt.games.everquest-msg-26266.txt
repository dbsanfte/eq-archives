>>> Stopped all the druids and necros pharming the warrens

    Last night's data point: six people in The Warrens total. Two people
wandered in at levels 8 and 7, and promptly died/trained out. My party was
levels 13 MNK and 14 NEC, and pulling pairs of blues/evens to me fine, with
the odd green add. Second duo was a level 9, then 10, then 11 cleric and the
anon druid PLing him. Third duo was a 51 druid and a 24 druid, who were
farming the top-end rares.

    Point of interest: The Muglwump, the big level 25 SHM tadpole mob,
Rampages. ;-)
