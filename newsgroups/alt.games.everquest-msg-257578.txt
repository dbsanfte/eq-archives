Or even more likely: Reader Expired.

He started that series over a decade ago. I figured I'd pick it up when 
it was finished and read it at my own pace at the time.

I get more satisfied with that decision each year he drags it out, 
especially as my friends reviews have gone from 'an exciting new epic to 
take its place alongside lotr' to... 'dear god just friggin end the 
stupid thing'. Not to mention my friends now -hate- most of the 
characters.

I probably won't even bother with it now.
