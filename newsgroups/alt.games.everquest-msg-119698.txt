That is definately not true in velious, was scowl to claws of veeshan
and got max allied. In the old world I've got tons of factions which
started out threaten to max allied now. I think when they added
"allied" it changed things? Also people may have thought this since
some quests no longer raised you if one faction maxxed that the quest
rose, they fixed that.
