    On our server you can still sell Judgement and/or BAotR for over 2 K.
And because of the Bazaar, you expend no effort doing it.

    AC 5 STA/INT/WIS 4 HP 80 MANA 65 and some focus effect. About the same
HPs as the second Chardok ring, depending on your STA, and the ninth Coldain
ring (it has 75 HPs and 9 STA, right?) For the casters in the guild, Ring of
the Shissar > Coldain Ring, and is pretty much > Chardok Ring (Chardok is
very long and involved to get second ring, but if you get second you can
also get a new first which is a big plus).

    Yeah. The name of the ring, as I said above, is Ring of the Shissar. And
like I said, you can cap Blood (who is weak) once you're all keyed up and
easily decide loot and gate in the ten minutes it takes the Emperor to wake
up. And blood loot is very nice - look it up on a spoiler site, two drops
per kill.

    Yeah. If you want Torpor, you have to group the shamans. It's a simple
example of group form determining group function. People who throw groups
together at random miss all the little synergies they could get if they took
time and planned.

    I do mean that. For Emperor, all our groups are pre-made. All of them.
Each group has different assignments, each group has different healing
needs, each group has different buff needs, each group may need bards for
different songs, etc. No, we're really retentive about groups - they're
planned for every big encounter.

    I did - I kept the main tank alive, then compared how quickly he needed
healing to how fast I felt the mob's health was dropping. Made a decision
that if I nuked once, at the right time, I wouldn't be late for a heal if I
misjudged the mob's health AND I should get the killshot. And I was right. I
don't try this on mobs like Flurries, though - my slow-as-molasses nuke
pretty much guarantees it only happens on lower damage output mobs.
