I am now ally with both Coldains and CoV and I did this all solo.  How you
ask?  First I hardly ever group as I am not on for long periods of time.  So
when I would see a giant killing party I would pluck a few arrows from a
distance and leech my faction that way.  Over the course of a few days
hunting in Great Divide and Eastern Wastes I went to ally with both the
Coldain and the Dwarves.
