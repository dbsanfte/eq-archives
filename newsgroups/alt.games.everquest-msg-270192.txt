The paragraph, you understand, but the gist of the whole post, you missed.

I'm fine with the fact that the little guys get replaced, doesn't bother 
me (or at least not much).  What gets me is where -everything- gets 
replaced, including targets with names.  Which is why I proposed mini 
zones with the encounter with the named inside (along with whatever help 
is appropriate, a little box with just the boss mob would in most cases 
be too easy), and then setting it up so a given character never gets to 
see that mini zone again once he's killed the boss inside.

Yep, if you eliminate mobs and don't replace them with -something- then 
you eventually empty the world.  Even with the plan I mentioned, this 
could happen, although the world wouldn't empty, and it would never 
empty for other people based on your actions, you could clear out every 
named and have nothing but "rank and file" mobs left to go after.

I don't think thats a big problem, if you make sure there's plenty of 
content out there to get you thru a level, then you won't care that 
those low level names out there are getting sparse, there are new names 
you were too low level to go after on your horizon.  Eventually you may 
top out, hitting the highest level in the game and clearing out every 
last name... but I put it to you that the same thing happens now 
eventually; once you've picked up every last piece of gear that a mob 
drops, there's little point in going back and killing him again and 
again, other than to gear up your friends.  I'd just as soon lose that 
capability entirely, put all the reward the guy is going to drop -on- 
him so when you kill him first time, you get it, and move on.

It isn't the way EQ is now, I'll grant you.  I was just thinking I 
personally would like it better this way, assuming some thought was put 
into working around the difficulties it presents.

I'm afraid I don't care a whole lot about what other players think
of me or my progress, so the "discussion of which guild killed him first"
thing doesn't help my immersion into the world.

They did have a mechanism for letting mobs care about what you've done, 
called Faction, in the game, and they used it in interesting ways in 
some places, where you'd start out nuetral and could single pull mobs, 
but later after losing faction would end up getting double or more, 
unless you leveled up to the point where nobody was willing to help the 
guy you attacked.  By and large, faction seemed to be forgotten as a 
mechanic after a while, in the later expansions mobs tended to hate 
everyone the same regardless of what they had or hadn't done, for or 
against other mobs of their faction.
