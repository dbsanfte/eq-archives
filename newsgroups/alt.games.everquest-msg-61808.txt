Same experiences here - no high-street stores have it on their release
schedule that I can see, and online will take 48h for processing, plus
another day or 2 for shipping, in most cases

So, the press release trumpeting a simultaneous global release date was
an outright lie then. I see absolutely zero difference between 
Kunark/SoV availability and SoL availability.

I get to spend a week listening to the guild having fun in Luclin, while
I'm stuck down on Norrath with nothing to do? Yay for me!

Maybe I can pop over to the UK server building and hammer on the doors
demanding a copy - anyone know the address? hehe
