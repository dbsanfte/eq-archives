I'm currently soloing Frost Giants in GD. I was wondering what is the best
pet for this job.
I've used earth and fire.

Earth had way to low damage/sec because of the root casting and the giant
kept fighting instead of fleeing because it was rooted. This caused the pet
to get hit a lot more then necassary.

Fire had way to low hp. The damshield and nukes made sure the giant went
down quicker, but the pet simply went faster.

I'm now using my water pet, good hp and nuking, but it still takes 1 Frost
Giant Berzerker to let me use 60-70 mana in a fight, mostly to keep my pet
alive long enough.

Is it simply this hard to fight giants as a mage, is there some technique I
don't know yet or is the Air pet worth it because of it's supposed high ac?

Thanks for any tips

Kilmir
