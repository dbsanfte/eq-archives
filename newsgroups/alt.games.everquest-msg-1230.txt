Have you considered how much of that goes into OH bandwidth, and
hardware costs?? ok, lets see 2.97 million,  how many servers now? 16,
18? ok believe 3-5 boxes per server farm+ backups so lets say 7 boxes
per server farm lets assume they are 2k per box, upgraded quarterly 
7*18*2000=250,000/3= 84000, 2-3 paid GMs per server at oh 84k annually
I'm being generous I know.  Dev team lets say 25 guys same base slary
Board support personel nother 12  12-30 guides per server at $10 a month
lets say 22 guides per server(220*18=3960 call it 4k)   45+12+25=82*7k
per month=574K

574+ 84+4= 662 monthly, lets assme that its an even 500k for multiple
OC3's, thats 1.162 leaving us with 1.808 for CS phone support, for
"acceptable 24 hour service" lets say peak time is 64 hours a week lets
say 40 persons using phones+ phone lines for them call it $15 an hour
thats 153k a month, plus computers on these peoples desk replaced
annually lets call it 1200 per box that 100 a month times 40 nother 4k a
month phone lines at $15 each call the monthly phone bill 1k, thats
another 160 off our 1.808 leaving us with 1.648  we need computer
support personell, again 84 a year call the computer support team 20
people. nother 140k thats 1.508M.  Management?? call it another 20 at
average 84, as their will be varying levels phone managers might get 50
and Upper management making 150. leaving us with 1.368. now don' forget
off-peak phone support.  15 an hour times 10 people*104 non-peak hours a
week* 4 weeks a month.  63k=1.305, now, electric, thats likely 300-500
they are in california, leave 800k a month.  thats not, a signifigant
amount of cash, esp as I haven't counted paper supplies, insurance, and
misc personell.
