Thread gone, so cant read it, but SURE hope they put that in game. Would 
be a GREAT boon for us tradeskillers that gotta have 2-3 mules just to 
keep our tradeskill stuff. Doing baking at the moment, almost 400 
vegetables on a mule, need a guildie every time i need a stack, and no 
space in bank or on me to have a few stacks of at a time.
