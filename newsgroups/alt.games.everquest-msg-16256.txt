At level 15, my Iksar Monk wanted to poke around a bit, so I caught a
port from Lake of Ill Omen to the West Commons, then got escorted and
bound to the edge of the West Freeport zone. I leveled quicker than
expected, fighting caimans and gators in Oasis. When I hit level 17, I
had to return to Cabalis to learn Feign Death.

I dreaded the trip back, figuring it would involve a lot of sneaking
and some corpse runs. This was not the case!

In Oasis, I hopped the barge to the ogre island. From there, I got a
SoW and Levitate and ran South, on top of the water (first shouting to
see if Faydedar was in the zone). At the Southwest corner of the zone,
I found the Teleportation Combine and swam into the tunnel below to
the Firepot Room (supposedly you can take damage from the fall into
the room, but maybe the levitate prevented it - though I thought
levitate to disappear when I started swimming). Stepping on the
right-most firepot on the South wall, I found myself in West Cabalis.

Look where you can port to from this zone room:

North Left:(fire on floor) to Grobb (entrance) 
North Center:(6 side gray) to Oggok (entrance) 
North Right:(6 side tall) to Erudin (near dock) 
East Left:(6 side gray) to Neriak Commons (entrance) 
East Center:(4 side wood) to Greater Faydark (under Kelethin) 
East Right:(6 side rust) to Northern Felwithe (entrance) 
South Left:(Brown box) to Halas(near dock) 
South Center:(Dark with blue) to East Freeport (on dock) 
South Right:(tall gold vase) to Cabilis West (entrance) 
West Left:(White marble) to South Kaladim (entrance) 
West Center:(Lava Lamp) to Akannon (entrance) 
West Right:(torch stand) to Rivervale (entrance) 

This was the easiest trip ever and I am sure I will be using this many
times in the future. I was amazed and had to share.
