I see precious little skill involved in playing EQ.  What I mean
by this is that there just isn't a whole lot involved in viewing
your display and operating your keyboard and mouse.  There's a
lot of nitpicky knowledge required to play a character well in
some situations:  knowing when and why to perform a particular
series of button presses and/or mouse actions.  But the mechanics
themselves are quickly and easily mastered.

Can anybody come up with an example of skill in EQ that:
1) does _not_ involve a Bard, and
2) does not boil down to simply knowing what to do?
