 I'm definitely willing to hear reasons why
> that wouldn't be good.

Think I would prefer to do away with levels completeley, and just use raw
experience to determine your skills / spells etc.  With the experience being
able to go up and down.

Another good thing about this is it allows more freedom as to when to
recieve skills etc.

Titles recieved (and not lost through death) at certain levels of experience
would be a good way to seperate the high 'levels' from the low, and to
signify progress and achievment. You would be unable to use skills / spells
if you fall below the required exp level.

This is probably not a new idea (probably grabbed from somewhere deep in me
brain that I dont recall :P ).
