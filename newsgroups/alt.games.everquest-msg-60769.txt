Look at the bright side...

Back when I was in college, I happened to be in the computer
room when they were installing a massive memory upgrade to the
time-sharing mainframe.  The CS department had managed to squeeze
it out of the budget, it cost many thousands of dollars.  It 
was a memory board the size of an extra-large pizza box.  

It was 256K (0.25 MB)...

Things have improved just a little bit since 1976, so enjoy
what you've got.  :-)
