If you are used to KEI, then it will seem like they are not doing much.  
They do speed up mana regen, whether sitting or standing, however, if you 
are standing, you lose your own sitting mana regen.  The visibility of 
the effect will depend on your level and your mana pool.

Breeze regens 2 mana per tick.
Clarity regens 4(L29) to 7(L48) mana per tick, depending on the level of 
the caster.
C2 regens 11 per tick.
KEI regens 14 per tick.
Tranquility regens 16 per tick.
VoQ regens 18 per tick.
