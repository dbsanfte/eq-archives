Stolen Shamelessly from Casters Realm (http://eq.crgaming.com/)


-------
CASTER BALANACING

There appears to be a new spell being toyed with on Test Server as
part of caster balancing.
A slightly scaled down version of Complete Heal is being tested for
Druids & Shaman. The spell is currently set at Level 54.

This spell has been very clearly marked as Test Only however and may
not go live at all. 

A new Bard song is also being tested which would provide high level
mesmerization ability. The song is currently being set at Level 58.
