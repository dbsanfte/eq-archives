So, this seems to be the essence of it.  A beastlord can replace the
shaman or enchanter on Slow duty.  We can replace the rogue on DPS
duty.  We can replace the enchanter on mana regen duty.  Heck, somebody
box a cleric on over for a backup rez, and let's just take a group of 6
beastlords. :)  In other words, when we are called on as "backup", a
group isn't giving up enough by taking a beastlord.  Contrast this
with, say, asking a ranger to tank, which is doable, but widely
perceived as sub-optimal.

Indeed, beastlords are quite self-sufficient.  I can see how they break
a model where a cleric, warrior and enchanter form the core of a great
group but are each helpless individually.
