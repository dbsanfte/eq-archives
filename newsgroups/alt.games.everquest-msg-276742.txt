Yes.
Group.
Yes.
Should be easy. You got the basic idea.
No. *
If you don't change it.
Depends. **
Don't know.
No practical benefit except that some classes normally need to read
books and such in a language they would not otherwise know, but all the
relevant information has already been translated into english on
various web sites.





* If the speaking character has skill 100 in that language, the other
group member need only listen.

** See previous answer, otherwise a character can only teach language
up to skill+1 to a listener. If the listener is also teaching the same
language (spamming the group), then eventually the other will get a
skill up and this see-saws back and forth until they reach skill 100.
