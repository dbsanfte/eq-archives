Dear Sock Puppet,
I find it interesting that your username and e-mail has only appear in
two posts in the history of Alt.Games.Everquest and those two posts
are specifically related to this "cyber affair".

LOL...please do...

I have a beautiful loving family and a house by the beach.  I have a
good job and an active healthy lifestyle.  I probably play Everquest
for about four hours a week.  Many people that I have played and
grouped are in much better situations than I am and I would know
because most of them are RL friends.  Very few problems (if any) here.
 Lots of responsibilities though.

Yeah, the boogey men are out to get him.

Right...those comments not supported with any facts.

You have done no different with your troll post, Mr. Sock Puppet.
