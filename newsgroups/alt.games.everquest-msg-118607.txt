Hmm hah you're doing better than me, been playing Faydwer residents
since release, including my first L60 and my current main both being
wood elves, and I can STILL get lost in Kel if I stop paying attention
to where I'm going. :-p

On the other hand, I can get through BB to GFay from the druid circle
with the monitor turned off. So I guess it all balances out.

I'm definately better outside cities though.
