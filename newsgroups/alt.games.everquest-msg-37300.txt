I, so far, have only needed an index card.

Two sides...

Side one "Asshole List"
Do not assist, do not group, do not port, do not bother being polite.  DO
NOT IGNORE, consider dangerous.

Side two "Charge Double List"
People who have demonstrated that they do not appreciate my porting them
about, and therefore should be automatically get the "persona non gratis"
rate for any service which I might provide.  This also includes people who
have demonstrated unwarranted, and/or irrational greed, and therefore shall
be shown no generosity.

Two columns on each side of the card.
Column 1: Name
Column 2: Reason they're there (in 5 words or less)

I'm a compassionate and forgiving deity (wizard) so you really gotta work to
get on this list... like flat out insult me after demonstrating a need to be
on the list.

What's sad is, I encounter these people occassionally, and they just
reinforce why they're on the list... some of them even get worse.

For example:
Asshole List:
Stupid Druidbitch ... Intentional Training

A few weeks ago I'm hunting with a group, and I notice Stupid Druidbitch
(who had been on my list for about 10 levels) kiting near and clearing lower
level groups away from what she wanted to hunt.  She runs up to my group,
begs desperately for a breeze... which our rather nice enchanter provides
(clarity).  Three minutes later, she runs her 66% dead kite through us...

About 45 minutes later she comes up to the enchanter and begs for another
clarity... about now I left the group (to go to bed)... noticing that Stupid
Druidbitch was hanging around a little closer to our group (being the last
one around)... I /tell our puller to be careful, "Stupid is on my asshole
list for intentional training for some months back."

Before I logged I got a tell from our puller that Stupid had pulled a very
large train onto the group, and parked the baddest mob in it ON the
enchanter... and dragged the rest of it back and forth ... I assumed she
hoped that we would distract/kill enough of the train that she could get exp
from whatever her "kite" was... and maybe pick off the lead mob after is was
weakened by slaughtering the group.

No... my asshole list is written in pen.
