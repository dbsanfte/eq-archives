For some reason I thought there was a ceiling of 100.  I figure it
logical to have a ceiling.  Then when you taunt, you go to the top of
the list.  But if there's no ceiling, then when you taunt, you go to
max(hate)+1. 

Of course there's other variables that add to hate.  Your level, your
proximity, your health, sitting, others? 

Getting back to the beginning of the thread, I'm not totally clear why
my cleric was indifferent to mobs in Unrest but my Paladin friend was
ready-to-attack.  Someone posted that maybe he did something previously
to adjust faction.  Oh well.
