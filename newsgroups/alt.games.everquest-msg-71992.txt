Enchanter made 35 hp earrings seem to be popular among monks.  I prefer
higher AC personally, and wear 2x sarnak earrings.

Dragon tooth choker

sarnak hide mask, forsaken pariah mask

Fine unless you want to upgrade to the 6/65

>wrist=shackle of stone, nothing

Iksar are kind of screwed on bracers.  I ended up with shackle of steel and
shackle of bronze until I managed to get two benevolence.  You're some ways
away from benevolence, but you can go ahead and do the shackle quests over
again for a 2nd shackle one rank down.  For purchasing, there's a siren
something bracer that doesn't seem to sell for all that much.

>arms=azuree

Plenty of 60 monks still wearing these.

>hands=gem encrusted gloves

Fine until epic unless you want to have haste on hands rather than waist,
then go for the silver chitin handwraps.

>shoulder=Dvlorg mantle

Fine.  Again, not many options.  Even fewer that are affordable.

>chest=fungi tunic

Plenty of 60 monks still wearing these too.

>back=spider fur cloak

Fine.

>waist=spider fur belt

Fine.  But you need haste somewhere.  Either a FBSS or silver chitin
handwraps are probably your best bet.

>legs=gatorscale legs

Fine.

>weapon 1=cane of tranqil
>weapon 2= Khaliz katar

You don't give your level.  Cane of tranquil is better than fist up to about
40 or so, but then your fist is better.  I don't know the stats on the other
one off hand.  In general, as you get higher level you want the faster
weapon in main hand and best ratio possible in off hand.

>Weapons and a haste item would be next I think but I spent my savings
>on the fungi tunic and need to start saving again

If you saved up for a fungi, FBSS or handwraps shouldn't be too hard to work
for.  Most of your equipment is quite decent and you'll see monks in their
50s still wearing a lot of these items.
