Look you lame ass moron. Don't follow any more of my posts with your insults
and idiot drivel.

If you had gone to the trouble of looking, you would have found out I have
been playing since about the first month the game was introduced and have
been posting to this group as long.

You hand out more off topic and wrong information then anyone else I have
seen in the last 4 years. You just don't know jack about the ranger class.
