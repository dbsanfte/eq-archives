Nah, CoH really isnt very much in demand. Yeah, its convenient, but it only
takes 1 mage to move a raid force. Needing 1 mage isnt high demand. People
like our focus items, but you dont need a mage on your raid to get them.
I've passed out dozens of bracers and rarely been asked to join in the fun.
Even when we do get on a raid, half the time we're told to sit back and make
mod rods. Thats no fun in itself, but many times people dont even use them.
Not that I'm complaining about our raid role, its fun to go out and raid.
We're just considered to be extras - a benefit if we happen to be around,
but usually not sought out.

So yeah, mages really arent in demand in the high end game. I still like
mine though. :) You'd just better like soloing.

Joe
