How the hell does THIS logic work? How does distributing limited
amounts to a large number of people cause the supply to be less than
letting "first come first server"ers buy however much they want?
Selling however much can be afforded to whoever will pay for it first
causes fewer people to receive the resources. NOT rationing causes
scarcity down the line.

1) Why wouldn't the gas sell?
2) What "every other man like him"? We're talking only one station
having gas available in this case. (By the way, resources sold just
fine during WW2 rationing, at least according to my grandparents and
my history books)

Cite specific cases where rationing has caused a shortage in supply.

Love people who are so extreme in their views that they make up
ridiculous "facts" to reinforce them...
