It only takes a few peoples taking advantage of the 4 hours delay to make
guilds suspicious of *anybody* who kills blood and leaves emp to poof
though.  And im not a fan of gimp methods like that =)  Prexus had some
drama when guild Y (notorious cockblockers, from ToV to RZtW) felt that
guild X was cockblocking them on Coirniav, even though Guild X offered them
a rotation.   So Guild Y posted flames and various blabber.. almost had some
kindof community support too, until one day they went and killed Coirs
trigger with 2 groups (to blow the spawn and force a respawn late at
night).. not only did they cop some flak for blowing spawns, but they even
lost the race to the respawn later that night heh.

We've all been there =)
Its kindof a catch 22 though.. they are blocking you from VT, you are
getting incredibly more desperate.. then you blow emps spawn for 4 hours,
which infuriates the guild, gives them some kind of material to flame you
for deliberatly blowing spawns.. and allows the officers to more easily
pursade the regular members to prolong the cockblock.  We too had emp ssra
perma killed, and coir become top priority for our rivals once we were at
that stage too.  Its just sad i guess, people see cockblocking as a lesser
problem to the "gimps" who blow triggers, delay spawns and camp events.

Well thats cuz CiH are dicks =)

Nod.  Although really, another gms ruling would be nice to see if that was a
SOE policy.. or the original GM just didn't understand what the event was
about.  Ive never seen a guild wipe to cyno though (or even heard of any
other).. so i don't even know what the event recycle time is. Or even if it
DOES recycle.  In which case, that just further boosts their point that
after giving you first shot, rezzing you in, they felt entitled to the
spawn.  i mean if it never resets, did your triggering of it entitle you to
every try of it, until the zone crashes? =)

Well it doesn't help that they can just use inktu'ta as an excuse either,
regardless of their real intentions

We have very strict rules on members conduct, which basically means a
blanket ban on posting, stiring or joining flame fests on the server boards
(and its really strongly enforced).. it works quite nicely in the sense that
as far as I can see, we have a very good reputation to all our rival guilds.
In saying that though, our average age is 25+ anyway (no high school
members) so its not like most people want to flame and the rules don't allow
it.. were just not like that.

Well...  Txevu has 3 progression mobs.  Mob 1 is near to zonein, a fast kill
with decent loots... we still kill him for loots (like i said, Txevu is very
poor loot rewards for the time invested) who drops a key... this is where
they will cockblock you.

The key takes you to progression mob 2, a real deep clear, they won't block
you on this one.
He drops a key for progression mob 3 (the gate keeper to Tacvi)... and even
if they kept Zun Muram perma dead... the way Tacvi is set up, anybody with
progression mob 2's key can start an instance in Tacvi.. whether or not they
ever killed Zun.

Well they are number 1... rotations will hurt them more than it will benefit
you (for pride, advancement, gearing, all that...)
You need to overtake them, and then lay the smack down =)   if they didn't
have complete dominence I think they would be much more inclined to agree to
rotations.

If you just tried having your warrior ready to agro at the respawn spot, i
think your leaders would be quite surprised at how pointless what they are
doing is.  Getting agro on respawns has never been an issue for us, nor even
on a banish because as you learned on herald, you just have the next tank
there ready to take over.

I wonder if one of your leaders heard about some leet strat involving mage
pets.. and missinterpreted it into this bizare strat =)

There are 2 noqs, how would the strat have worked with just 1 mage?
Ah well, theres nothing like making a non standard class feel crucial on a
mob =)  But you really are wasting your time doing all that stuff.
