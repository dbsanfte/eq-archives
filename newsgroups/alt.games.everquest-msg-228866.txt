    After the savings with what mana preservation foci on? Did the player
change foci to see if it was still 1%? And, if so, couldn't you just remove
your mana preservation focus item when Reclaiming to cheat the system? If
this system is set at 1% loss using the best possible mana pres focus in
game, and doesn't check what mana pres focus you have on now, then next
expansion when mana pres. numbers get better on new loot top-end mages will
be able to pet canni again. So I can't see how they've stopped the practice,
unless they plan to never improve mana preservation foci again (or nerf IRE
after every expansion).
