Anyone and I mean anyone that sits at a zone medding is a moron.
If they are AFK at a zone they are complete morons and
they deserve to die.

Gee lets go AFK while at the ONLY  EXIT to safety.
Yeah that's a good idea.

Zones are death traps. Always have been always will be.
Don't want to be hit by a train, get off the tracks.
Don't pull to a zone (unless you are the only ones in the
zone) Don't med at a zone. Don't rest at a zone. Don't even
stand there for too long. And definitely don't go afk at a zone.

I /shout TRAIN to ZONE! as a courtesy, but I don't go out of my
way to avoid people at a zone, in fact I run right over top of them
if they are in my way.

My favorite is when some one shouts "What zone?" What
difference does it make? If you are at a zone MOVE!
