What's stupid about it? You're looking to force the game to save. Sit,
camp, stand. That simple. You don't have to camp all the way out. Just hit
the camp button. A simple alternative is to just drop anything at all. A
loaf of bread even...

Getting lost is not gimpy - it's just plain stupid.

Experienced player? Dropping something that's going to be -gone- in 5
minutes? No - experienced players grab their graph paper, a pen, and their
trusty sense heading /loc combo. (Thinking back to the days of mapping out
dungeons playing D&D and then again playing single player games like gold
box AD&D, and Bards Tale)

Dropping something that's guaranteed to poof in 5 minutes, or be picked up
by a wandering NPC, is pretty damn silly if you're depending on it to find
your way back out again.
