Picking and choosing the spells to have memorized is getting a pain at
lvl 5 as a shaman, i have almost all lvl 1 and 5 spells and they all
have there use, depends on if you wan't to buff others or not, but
i shure could use 2 slots, my lvl 14 necro has lesser problems with
that now since removing and memorizing another is rather quick, a few
seconds at most, a lvl one takes bloody ages and some *lol*
