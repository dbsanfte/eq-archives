They have never deleted characters.

Never.

The only chracters which might be deleted are ones on perm banned 
accounts.

At one time they were going to delete all characters under level 2 who
had not been played in a month. Due to player opinion, they did not
even do that.

Their guaruntee is 3 months, so if something weird happens they can
say the guaruntee was 3 months. They never are deleted. They want you
to come back in two years and many people do.
