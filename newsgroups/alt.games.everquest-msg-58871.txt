Heh...I love the folks that say,"I've been on the
Internet for  20 years and blah,blah,blah..."

>>>and then don't know what the RFC's
       are or what they're for.<<<

Hell, I HAVEN'T been on the internet for 10
years, and even I knew  it was poor form to
top post.  And to reply to a 9 kb post with
"me too."  And to do all kinds of other crap
that interupt the flow of a conversation.

If anybody has a question about top-posting
and why it's generally frowned upon, get into
the habit of thinking of Usenet as a giant
place where it's ok to eavesdrop on others'
conversations.  Not only is it ok, but it's also
encouraged for you to interupt or add your
own comments along side them.

Now think of a normal conversation.  Do
people answer questions before they're
asked?  When trying to help somebody
catch up that may not have "listened" the
last 5 minutes, would you not re-cap the
last bit of conversation?  Would you
repeat an entire Shakespeare poem to
discuss the significance of one line?  Would
you call somebody a Nazi because they
disagreed with you (just thrown in for
humor...if people don't agree with me,
of COURSE they're Nazis!!! ;-)  )?

The preceding "rules" of a conversation
include, in order, top-posting, quoting of
relevant material, and judicious snipping
of message content.

It's just politeness in a written media, as
opposed to a verbal communication.  Doing
things "your own way" is fine for a lot of
things, and no Usenet Police will come
knocking on your door because you top
post or do "me too" replies.  But what
CAN happen is that somebody will see
the style of your posts, figure you're just
some clueless n00b and therefore both
stupid and not worthy of replies, and
just leave you out of the conversation
entirely.

Unless you call them a Nazi.
;-)
