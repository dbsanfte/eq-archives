Which brings us back to his "I can't even imagine that it would be
implemented in such an idiotic fashion" statement.  It's far more
likely to consider a simple stack of individual damage (each time
someone new does damage, put them in the stack, then add any
additional damage to their entry) than it is to keep a separate
stack of each damage and total it later.   With a simple tree
instead of a stack, that's a trivial operation and much, much
faster as well as more efficient in terms of memory.

Even assuming they're stupid - and I don't think the game would
be as successful as it is if they're as stupid as some people seem
to think - it's still an incredible burden to keep a stack of each
hit as compared to one of each person's damage.   The game runs
on non-supercomputers;  that indicates to be their code is at least
moderately optimized.
