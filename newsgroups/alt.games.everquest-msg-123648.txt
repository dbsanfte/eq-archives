The Amway folks got $2000 from some good friends of mine.  Tried to sucker
us into it too.  Not thier fault, it was the pushy guy on the tier above
them.  We went to thier house for a presentation by that guy and he got a
little miffed when I kept asking "but who is going to be doing the selling?"
I kind of wanted to buy some of the product until I sat through that.  He
wasn't even willing to give me a base price for the products.  From what I
could glean, product goes through at least 3 hands before it comes to a
customer. BUT....they don't encourage selling of product.  They just want
you to sucker your friends and family into the scheme.
