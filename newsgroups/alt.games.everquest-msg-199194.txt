Mobs on top the big plateau in the NE part of the zone are level 
45-ish and popular with upper 50s players. The NW part of the zone 
is mostly dark blue into the mid 50s, the SW part is mostly dark
blue until the low 50s, the SE part until the high 40s.

I've seen the Light Cheetah several times while hunting in the SE corner.
The rest don't ring a bell. Better look in Mons Letalis for the spire 
spirit, you won't find that in SD.

They're all fairly rare. No way I'd bother with Twilight quests without
a good tracker. Been there, done that, gave up. There are no vendors in SD. 
Closest vendors would be in Twilight Sea then Katta. Most likely to have 'em? 
Bazaar.
