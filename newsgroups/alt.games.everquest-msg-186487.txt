The QUESTION was what do I do when I stop killing stuff. Period. I
said I've gone weeks at a time, but that's really not changing my
answer to the question. If I stop killing stuff and keep playing, I
roleplay. What is so hard for you to grasp about that? I only
mentioned that I have gone for weeks at a time without ever hunting to
illustrate my perspective. I have never quit hunting all together.
But, that's irrelevant. The point is, I have gone for a fairly
extended period logging in nightly without hunting.

Really, child, I'm sure you're too old to be playing these bullshit
playground games. You're desperately reaching for a fight. Get over
it.
