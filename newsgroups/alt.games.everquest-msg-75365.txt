Ahhh cool.. so the part you need is this(one problem though, historian
ben despawns after giving the book so the quest can only raise your
faction by one every so often when hes up):

(say black to loremaster sarl in thurg)

"
You say, 'Black' 

Loremaster Sarl says 'Excellent, I know what we're lookin fer now. 

As soon as you say "Black" he will despawn and respawn in the library.
So, if you know where the library is, simply ask him about the name of
a slain dragon, and then say "Black." He will pop in the library. Just
run over to him and hand him 50pp and he will give you the book. 

Lorekeeper Sarl says 'Ah hah! Here it is! Let's see here..Yes, I
remember now. This is 
the story o Burdael. Ill lend ya the book, but it'll cost ya 50
platinum. 

PART III ï¿½ FROSTONE IN CRYSTAL CAVERNS 

Gave the book to Historian Baenek in Frostone. 

Historian Baenek says 'You found one of our lost tomes! A lost volume
of the Book of Grudges, quite a find. Oh dear Brell! This evidence
proves that the legend of Burdael is true! Thank you Metopious. And
now I suppose you wish to meet his ghostly form. I have snesed him
from time to time. I will call to him now. Go and wait for him in the
lower halls. His spirit sometimes calls to me from where the fearsome
Stalag Terrors lair. Be warry though, unlife may have twisted his mind
beyond reason." 

Your faction standing with the CitizensOfFroststone got better." 


This is another reason why I picked vah shir to make a shaman with
(only shaman that gets sneak.... very nice for getting indiff ;) )

From comments there on allakhazams (in case that site is as slow for
you as for me sometimes):

"And before you ask, you can do that part multiple times, but a guildy
did it 3 times, burning up 150pp, and still can't buy/sell there. So
unless there is another quest that is undiscovered as of yet, you will
need to rely on your skills if you have them or rely on others to help
you out. I have found that this is not a problem, there is generally
someone there to help you. 

Dzaka Wolfcaster 
Scaled Mystic of 39 Moons Past 
Torvonnilous"


You need max claws of veeshan faction to actually do the quest
fully but not to do the above parts.
