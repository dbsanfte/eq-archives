Nonsense.  I know several 60s who solo mobs that are significantly
more difficult than blizzard spiders or FG 'shrooms or TD raptors.
They do it because they *CAN.*  They do AAXP on the above mobs
because the risk/reward was greater;  VERY little risk per AAXP
level.  That's changed and they're bitching.  NOT because they can't
find level-appropriate mobs to hunt solo, but because it's not quite
so easy to get an AAXP level or two per session.   Not any rangers,
mind you, but that's true for shaman, druids, wizards, monks, and
warriors I know personally.  Probably true for clerics now too, for
that matter.

Well, "reasonable rate" just changed, didn't it?  You CAN still kill
those same mobs and you WILL still get XP.  Just not at a "reasonable
rate."  If you want more, you move on -- same as you did from about
level 3 on up...

Some are, some aren't.  Some of the "stupid" choices just got a lot
better.  Increased STA (more HPs), increased regen (speaks for itself),
and so on.

Not necessarily, as I've said.  Fighting a blizzard spider now doesn't
give reasonable experience.  That's the same choice you had when a bat
didn't give reasonable experience anymore.  So now you kill something
a bit harder, something that's actually a bit dangerous, and something
where the risk/reward is more appropriate.  And the 50s just moving into
Velks actually find some spiders here and there instead of four 60s
soling all the spawns.
