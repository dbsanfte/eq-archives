If you go to CB it is pretty easy to find a group most of the time.  The
only problem is that, once you get into the teens, it's time for people to
start playing their class as it was meant to be played.  Tanks have to tank,
casters have to sit and med, etc.  Alot of the people there don't seem to
understand that and they all think this is just like fighting those decaying
skeletons.  I know that when I started my chanter and was around lvl 10 or
so, we took the TR and the tank pulled about 5 mobs: Crush, The Prophet, an
oracle, and a lego, and a cent.  I could mez all except for Crush and the
Prophet, so if my group had stayed on Crush, then killed the Prophet (as I
had told them to do) we'd have been fine.  Instead, 2 were on crush and the
other three were each fighting their own mob (none were no The Prophet).
All of a sudden the tank says "run" and everyone scatters.  /sigh...  Most
of my groups went something like that.  So if you are willing to put up with
that kind of thing, I'd say go for the group.  It may be annoying and
stressful, but it's faster than soloing.  And if you don't have alot of
time, don't worry about it, those groups never last very long anyway.  Just
make sure you get your ass out of there and head for PC as soon as possible
(I usually go at about lvl 12).
