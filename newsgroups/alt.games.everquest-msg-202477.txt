Which is irrelevant to his point that it's idiotic to have a server
status page that always shows the servers up hours before you can log
in after a patch. 

It really is a fucked up approach to customer service, lets lie to our
customers on a regular basis so they'll waste time trying to log in.
It's pissing off some customers for absolutely no reason that I can
think of.
