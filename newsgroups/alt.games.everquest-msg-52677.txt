    Going by the "gentleman's rules": it depends. I'll use your example on
my server. On my server, Frenzy is considered a "camp", AM is a "camp", and
Sage is rolled into the "Exe and friends" camp. So if you were on my server,
you'd inform the person doing the camping that you were interested in
assuming one of his camps as he's holding down multiple areas. To be fair,
you'd ask the person if there's a particular camp they'd like to hold, and
respect that decision. So if you only wanted Frenzy, but the person really
wanted to keep Frenzy above the rest, you'd respect that and claim something
else.

    This is the solution that will earn you the most respect from everyone
else in the zone, and those are the people you want to support you if the
person camping half of Dead Side wants to be an arse. The perception will be
that the person holding all those areas is "greedy" if they won't yield one
of their choice to you when asked, and so if you petiton and invoke the PnP
people will understand. The key is to know what the "commonly accepted
camps" are. In Nagafen's Lair I was in a group camping King/Priest/Champion,
when a level 60 bard came by with friends and demanded one of Champion or
King (friend wanted No Drop warrior weapons for rogue epic quest). He was
quite belligerent until I asked him to ask his guild whether those three
rooms were considered one camp or not. He did, found out they were, and
apologized profusely for his mistake. Later on I sent a tell to the person
that wanted Painbringer when it dropped, because the bard had respected our
claim.

    This also depends. Why do you want one of "his" camps? If the reason is
"we don't get XP in Ass/Sup, we do in AM" or "we need a Shiny Metallic Robe
for our rogue's Ragebringer" you're likely to earn support. If the reasons
are "I want an SMR for my level 12 necro" or "The loot is better in AM",
well, people won't support you as much.

    This is good. Things would go a lot smoother in EQ if people went into
zones expecting to treat others the same way they'd want to be treated.
Sadly a lot of EQ players seem to want asymmetric relations. 8(
