bottom line is that eq is a great game and I liked it for awhile. but
(not everything....)then  when I get on here and disagree with some of
the dumb policies (for instance ebaying), the bizbee's come out of the
wood work, which really leads me to believe that he is really a GM or
higher.....We all know that Brad reads these posts, but since
everybody knows Brad, he is abit more polite and doesn't throw stuff
at you the way bizbee does. I mean who else would want to really
"research" the posts like a detective like he does to try to get dirt
on somebody because they don't happen to believe the same way he
does..........???Also bizbee, without even "researching" the posts
like you do, I would bet that you are a hard core company man who
backs EQ 100% of the time........
