Depending on how many Skill points you have Sow Potions IIRC around the low
30's the Kunark book on EQ says 21, but it's higher then that.  You can make
them as soon as you hit 25 success rate will vary though depending on your
Wisdom.  You can only train 5 points per level at 25 in Alchemy.  I can not
recall though if Alchemy is cap restricted per level.  I was making them
though on a regular basis at LVL 30 with few failures.  I guess the number
generator was kind to me.
You will need the following items to make your potions though.
1.  A Medicine Bag available at most merchants who deal in Alchemy.
2.  Birthwart, Fenugreek, and Wolfs Blood.  All the ingredients you require.
Again available at your major Alchemy retailers.
3.  A Bear Skin Potion Bag.  Available from your friendly neighborhood
Tailor.  Usually if you provide the Skin the tailor will make you the bag,
at a small cost to you if any at all.  You will need this bag to combine
potions from 5 single units down to 1 unit of 5 shots, or 10 single units
down to 1 unit of 10 shots.

Good Luck fellow Shammie for Alchemy is not an inexpensive trade skill to
master.  Hope this info helps.
