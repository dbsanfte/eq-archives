You must be having major bad luck. I hunted there a pile recently for
experience with my ranger (a lot of them monsters are animals). I
rarely paid any attention to where I was in the zone (as long as I
fought near *some* wall). I never ran into this guy. He must stay
really local to that spot. I don't even remember anything white or
yellow on track, and rangers track almost half the zone.

Can't you kill him? Or does he cast/summon?

CONGRESSMAN:  "These reports undoubtedly prove that your product makes
    people die. You are selling things which make people die, but not
    only do they just die, they also become addicted to your product
    for tens of years before they die, thereby supplying you with
    obscene amounts of money in exchange for letting them die."
TOBACCO REPRESENTATIVE: "Yeah, so?"
CONGRESSMAN: "Only us governmental officials are legally able to kill
    people and take their money."
