Thanks for the assist, though I already have a Crypt Robber's
Chestplate.

I'm realy interested in a plate look, but I was seriously under geared
until I spotted the Crypt Robber's Chestplate for 2k, so I can't
really downgrade like that. I can always quest a Barnicle Breastplate
really quickly if I need one for a special occasion though.

Thanks for the assist though.
