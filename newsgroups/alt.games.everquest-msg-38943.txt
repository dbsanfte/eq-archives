Huh? Care to post a link to that? I've never heard of the case...
Anyway, if by any remote chance it's actually true, the problem lies
with that person being allowed to have children, rather than with him
playing EQ.

The guy has no right whatsoever to take away her "crack", at least not
in Western countries. If he's bothered because the washing and cooking
doesn't get done, he can get off his fat, beer-guzzling, WWF-watching
ass and do the cooking himself for once in his life, or he can try to
become a person actually worth spending time with, and earn back her
interest or... yes, he can get a divorce. In any relationship, if one of
the partners prefers the company of a computer to that of the other,
they may as well call it quits straight away and save themselves some
aggravation.
