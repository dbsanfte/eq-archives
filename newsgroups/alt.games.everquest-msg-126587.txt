He is saying that it is so rare a drop, that it is likely you will have
maxxed out your faction by the time it happens.  Off the top of my head, I
don't know where else you can check your faction in FV.  You can do it from
a distance so as not to be killed attempting to determine your faction
level.  It is pretty safe to assume that if you get the message informing
you that your faction cannot get any better with them, that you are no
longer KOS, as Ogres have managed in the past to become nonKOS in FV.
