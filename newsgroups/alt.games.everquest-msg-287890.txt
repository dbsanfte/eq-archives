There are various keys for targetting nearest mob, cycling through all
nearby mobs, toggling between the last two mobs you've selected, toggling
between yourself and one other target, select nearest PC, etc.  I've used
the Options/Keys window to change which keys I use for most of these, so
I'm not sure what the default keys are any more.

I'd suggest looking at the Options/Keys window and finding the section
dealing with targetting, and see what the choices are.  Try out the keys
shown for those choices, decide which selection commands you like, and
then maybe change what keys invoke those commands.

Sorry, I'm not familiar with bard weapon choices.

Sounds like maybe you were (a) fighting mobs that run at low health and
(b) you were hitting them for enough damage to take them to low health
but not actually kill them.

Are the mobs gray?  Many (though not all) mobs won't aggro if gray.  And
of course not all mobs are KoS to begin with.  Since you didn't say what
level you were or what mobs you're talking about, it's hard to be more
specific.
