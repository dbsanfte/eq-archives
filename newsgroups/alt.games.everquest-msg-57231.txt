You said later that you have at least one 64Kbps channel and that you plan
on playing only 2 accounts at the same time.

You should be fine.  Many people have played 2 accounts on a 28.8Kbps dial
up at the same time.  It was not GREAT, but it was good enough.  Since you
are at least twice that speed you should be ok.
