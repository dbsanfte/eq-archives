Shamans are a pet class.  They get thier first pet at level 34 and a better
pet each spell level after that.  I use my pet to take aggro when I first
pull so I can lob a few DOTs, sometimes he even holds aggro thru the DOTs so
he must be pretty tough.  Pet is also good when I get ADDs, he can usually
hold his own til I get the ADD rooted and dotted and can get back to helping
him out.  And last but not least, never underestimate the loyalty of the
shaman pet, he will sacrifice himself for me, holding aggro while I run for
the zone.

A shaman pet may not be as powerful as a mage or necro pet, but the shaman
is also not as weak as the mage or necro.  If a mage or necro pet bites the
big one, the mage or necro is soon to follow.  Not so with a shaman.  Higher
HP, AC and better combat skills means the shaman can step in where the pet
left off.

Shamans are considered one of the best soloing classes.  Druids are NOT a
better soloing class, but probably about equal.  They are better at
multi-kiting, but that requires a certain type of zone to work well and
limits the places Druids can successfully solo.  Druids and Shamans are both
powerful and versatile classes, but if I had to choose one, it would be the
Shaman, which is what I did.
