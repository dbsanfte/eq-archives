If the bards circles are ever widening, they are idiots. Tight circles means more mob
control, you want to stay just out of their reach.

You, on the other hand, might want to exercise a lot of caution, if you see a bard or druid
or wizard working with a crowd of mobs, they must be considered a real and present danger.
Bards don't care so much, but for a druid or wizard, people in their kite area are the worst
thing they can see, since they are spending a lot of time and energy packing the mobs
together tight enough for AOE.

A bard loses a bit of DPS if one of his swarm peels off and attacks a bystander, once the
bystander is dead the DPS comes right back... no big deal.

Generally, though, with either my druid -or- my bard, I make a point of finding a clear
running area to kite in with noone nearby, both from a practical standpoint and because I
don't want to hurt anyone my mistake.  If, however, someone enters an area I've been working
for an hour or so, then I figure they get what they get, the sight of a pale green blur
running in tight circles, never stopping, with half a dozen flies following him around like
gosling on a mother goose should be a big red Caution flag.
