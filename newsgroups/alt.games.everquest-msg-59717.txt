    Like the Warders did in Sleeper's for a while? ;-)

    NoS dropped off The Kly, the boss mob in Dalnir. As Dalnir was at Kunark
release:

-the goos near The Kly had Vox's breath weapon
-The Kly was an insanely rare pop. Most estimates of how long it would take
to get a NoS were around the same as the camp time for JBoots when they
dropped in Najena.

    The goos having the Vox breath weapon was a mistake, so they corrected
it. After VI figured out it was becoming Drelzna II down there with the
silly camps, they moved the NoS to Drusella Sathir in Howling Stones. IIRC
she's roughly a 24 hour spawn, loads the NoS as a rare drop, and is not
"casually campable" like The Kly was.

    Now, the one item that *was* dropping off the wrong mob was the Jewel
Encrusted Ring (or a similar name). Stats were Ac 10 STR 7, again IIRC.
Dropped off giants, and apparently should not have. My theory is that it's
the reward for the complete Overthere Hammer quest, but I have no way of
testing that.

    Velious did have them get squat, in a way. The one "mistake" item that
dropped was the Yelinak sword, the Griffin whatever. It was dropping off
regular Sentries. And VI did the right thing, for once: they changed all
copies of the sword to the items that should have dropped. Now, the first
people in Velious did get to take advantage of very high drop rates on PoG
and Kael armour, but that's not an actual item database error.

    What amazes me is that the one thing that players seem to focus on - the
loot tables - aren't gone through with a fine-tooth comb before release.

    So am I. Gotta get there and get the extra loot on day one! 8)
