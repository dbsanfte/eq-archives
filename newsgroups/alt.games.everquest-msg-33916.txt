In the lower levels you dont "need" a group but i recommend it. In the
upper levels you are better off in a group cause the mobs hit hard for
the amount of xp you get soloing. Mostly it is ignorance or jealousy
that makes people hate necros. here's a macro i set up to help out
while grouping.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Target the puller when he pulls multiple mobs to the group. If there
are a lot of bodies on the ground or you cant see him very well just
select his name in the group list.


/em shouts ... "Bones, go over and help %t kill a monster"
/assist
/pet attack
--------------------------------------------------------------------

using this macro you can sit and med and still sic pet on the mob (via
the assist function) and not have to get up.

Another thing, if you can solo the same mob by using darkness and fear
kiting, then why not do it in a group and save the cleric a lot of
mana he would otherwise be using to heal the fighters? The downside is
that in crowded areas you get a lot more adds. Always keep fear memmed
because in severe add situations ive saved several lives with a last
moment fear.

A lot of times i dont bother with DoT's in a group cause the mobs are
usually dead before the dot gets to run its full course.

Try sometime to get a group of a few necros and a few mages together.
You'll have a lot of fun with all those pets going nuts.
