Yup. This is why I am doing my own, along with the research quest. I
want a high research skill so I can be the guild researcher. 
 Why? because research has been somewhat ignored by Verant for a while.
I am expecting some new research spells to be added soon. Maybe with the
new expansion. Either way, being a master researcher is a useful skill
to be able to offer your guild.
