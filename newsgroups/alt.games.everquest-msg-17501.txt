Id say either conj or evoc, depending on your play style. If youre soloing
youre probably using the swarm line dots for the major part of your mana, so
conj wouldmake sense. In some groups, dd will be more appropriate, where you
need evoc.
At 52 (i think) you get breath of ro which is a nice evoc dot, so evoc skill
is useful for that. Also for quad kiting, the lightning based dd spells are
evoc.
Id go for evoc if you cant mak your mind up.
