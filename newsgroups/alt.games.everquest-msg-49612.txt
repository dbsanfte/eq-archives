I disagree.  I've been killing the guard near Lavastorm in Nektulous for
a couple levels now, on and off, and he drops a newspaper sometimes...
I pull him as quickly as he spawns, and there's noone near him when
I do.  He doesn't drop any other weird stuff at the same time, if this
is a prank its an elaborate one.

He's dropped Ogre, Dark Elf, some sort of human (Qeynos?) and
Rivervale, all issue 7, I can confirm that the same issue of the
Rivervale paper is sold in Rivervale, since I had to bop back there
to train dodge.
