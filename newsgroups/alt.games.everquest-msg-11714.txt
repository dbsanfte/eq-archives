I just took my 33 Druid into Najena for my periodic Elemental hunt in
search of Swirling Mists. Well, I was a little suprised when, in my
formally newbie dungeon, I noticed several Blue skeletons on the top
level. These guys are pretty dangerous, I'd say it is suicidal for any
mid 20 or lower to try and solo in there now.

The new skellies are about 30th, 750 HP or so and hit for a max 52.
Because of the limited visibility in there, you can't really get around
them - they pretty much aggro on sight. They seem to be guarding all of
the entrance ways. Also, they hover around the entrance if they are
trained to the zone. I pulled 2 to the Lava zone, healed and medded full
(10 min) and went back in - they were both still there.

The good news is they are not magic resistant at all, I killed 5 or so
and all spells seemed to hit for full damage. One root broke after
hitting him with a Combust. They drop 2-3pp each, cloth and bronze.
Casting can be tough, though, they are fast and sight distance is bad.
At 33, I got 1/3 blue bub exp per kill. May be a nice place to hunt for
30 something Clerics and Tanks now. I'd hate to die in there, they spawn
pretty quick and you will need to fight your way back in for a CR unless
you can get Invis to Undead.
