    Would he WANT to? He kills boss mobs, to be the "baddest of the bad".
Not sit in front of the brew cask getting carpal tunnel. I'm a tradeperson
myself, and I can understand why someone who wanted a game to be exciting
wouldn't even consider doing them.

>Played all class and race combinations up to 60?

    Given he's the guild leader of Fires of Heaven, I imagine he has access
to any class at level 60 that he'd want to play. Certainly lesser guild
leaders do. As for race combinations, why? So the perspective is changed
when you're in combat?

>Done all the quests?

    Given Furor's gear, I doubt there's any quests he could do that would
result in an upgrade to his gear - so why bother?

>No one and I mean no one can say they have done everything.

    No, but they can say they've done everything that would remotely be
useful or interesting to them.
