Too bad, vox and naggy have great loot for the level at which you can attain
them (Cloak of Flames comes to mind). But if you level fast enough you won't
really notice the lack. Just make sure you gank gorenaire to keep your
pallies happy :P.

PoP introduced a lot of very good gear which makes a lot of the older
expansion encounters much easier. The extra 5 levels and upgrades that go
along with it also made normal raidstuff single-groupable.
The better upper gear also trickles down to lower levels. For instance the
Windblade is a huge dps weapon compared to practically anything up till
higher Luclin zones. All previous good wepons wielded at 55+ by casual
players then tend to get dumped at the bazaar for lower level guilds to
grab. This mudflation gives lower guilds a nice boost in power and they can
take down targets a lot better and with fewer people then before.

In other words, yes you will have it easier :).

Just don't be fooled. Some mobs are easier because of your relative good
gear, but they can still eat your raid if something goes wrong.
