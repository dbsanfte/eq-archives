Two paladins, a ranger, two druids and an enchanter with group.  I've easily
done missions with similar lineups before--but I think the fact I was 56 may
have pushed us up to the next "chunk," especially since so much was higher
than blue to the rest of the group.  (I'm used to entire dungeons being blue
to my 51/52 Druid.)
