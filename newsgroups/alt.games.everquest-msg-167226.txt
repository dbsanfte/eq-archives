Better yet if you spot an ebay noob (a melee class.....like a 60th
level warrior who says "but how do i tell which way is north?" or a
high level necro who ooc's "but how do i make someone twitch?") group
with them.....give them levitate and lead them off the highest cliff
and bind them in mid air. the entrance to kael from EW should do the
trick. eventually theyll return to their bind spot. over and over
again. ding back to 10th. You could say "hey! look at this neat trick
we can do!" /troll on Because most of them got to 60th level via
affirmative action they are obviously unqualified to understand whats
going on and are therefore a detriment to any group they join. Hell,
maybe GMs will assign groups from now on.....you just stand in line
until some government agent assigns you a group based on your race,
not on your class or ability to play said class effectivly. This is
how the San Francisco Fire Department got stuck with a bunch of female
gnomes who dont even speak common tounge and a lower than average
strength than a bunch of ogre males capable of carrying an unconcious
troll down an escape ladder. And the East Commons chief of police went
to a barbarian with a low iq instead of an erudite with a college
degree. The dumbass kept telling people to look for a dragon when
everyone knows it was a griffon whos been killing noobs passing
through the zone. Hell, there were even eye witnesses who saw the
griffon but he wouldnt take that into account. Screw Verant. You can
have my stuff.  /troll off
