Agreed, seconded, and what he said.

Bonus: Get those belts and pads. All of them. Get in to Kaladim and
feign death near old whatsisname. Turn them all in. You can get to
indiff that way in a half hour and a half dozen backpacks.

Long long ago, in a character far far away, my Iksar monk was amiable to
most of Kaladim, and indiff to most of Kelethin. My buddy the Iksar
Necro was dubious to most of Kelethin too. I think we were the first
Iksars to be able to trade and bank in Kelethin and Kaladim. We went to
Crushbone at level 3 and stayed there through 20, marathon style.
