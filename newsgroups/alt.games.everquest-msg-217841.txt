   Whew!  I thought I was the only one for whom the information
presented on Lucy isn't crystal clear.  

    What I am hoping for is that these things are like mini-kei potions,
that they stack into twenty, that they take over a 200+ skill to make,
and the cost to make them is low enough that they can be sold for around
10p each.  If they can't be lugged around in a stack, and if they cost
much more than that, I can pretty much see them being little more trader
satchel ballast.  If both of these conditions are met, then having them
at over 200 skill will help to keep the market from being flooded with
the things, and reward those who go through the pain of GM the skill.
