The lizards are all based ont he same mythos so it wouldn't make much
sense if they were to create another Lizard race.

IMHO, I think Gnolls, Aviaks, and Orcs are good choices. Aviaks would
be interesting. Their city could be something like Kelethin except
there are no bridges. The plus side, they have innate Levitate
(although it's more like they can glide).
