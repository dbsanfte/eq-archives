Ok, that makes more sense if that's your belief system, I guess I hadn't
thought of it that way. When I hear people choosing to "pass" or "roll", my
perception has been that they are making the choice between:

1) passing and thereby preserving the option to roll on something of higher
value later; or
2) take this bird in the hand now and give up the opportunity to get
something better later.

Neither choice suggests a commitment to actually equip the item and use it.
I guess I have this differing view from yours because of my strong belief
that most loot is just plats waiting to be converted. I honestly can't
remember the last time I saw someone loot something that they then equipped,
I would be utterly suprised to see it happen. And even in my most cynical
moments, I don't for a moment believe that pickup player X is really trying
to convince me that he wants this particular piece of loot because it's an
upgrade. I know what he's going to do with it and I don't have a problem
with it. If I want to play in that game too, I will roll for it. The fact
that I don't just means that I'm not interested in making that choice.

The one area where NBG has worked reasonably well has been ldon augments.
Since those are no drops and generally of obvious benefit to particular
classes, it's a lot easier to play the system the way it was intended. If an
INT augment comes up, I'l pass on it because I know it will be of more value
to the int casters in our group, AND I want to preserve my ability to later
roll on a WIS or STA augment. Where it gets tricky is when resist augments
come up. We all need resists, so there's no NBG issue really, it's purely a
question of how wants to use up a roll and potentially thereby give up the
chance of rolling on a class-benefitting augment later.

Hah! I know better than to think that I can get ahead of my little bald
friend. No, I am forced to rely upon fortuitous computer breakdowns in order
to stay *in the running*.  And what's this "Grr", some new team-building
variant on "Gratz!"?
