Asherons Call has them.

Its certainly technically doable. EQ would however, unfortunately have 
to have a set of textures for each season, and this would likely be a 
very substantial undertaking for a purely aesthetic effect (especially 
since nobody hunts on the surface of the planet any more...so who'd 
really even care)

To be really cool, the mob spawns could be seasonalized too...
