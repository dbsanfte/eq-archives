UO isn't dead newb, but - you were right about not comparing the
two...apples and oranges and all that.

Now from someone who played UO for nearly 4 years:  it's a fun game and not
much at all like Everquest - 2 entirely different games in which you get to
be someone else and slay powerful creatures and maybe pick up a friend or
two to join in your fight against evil.

That said, both games IIRC, allow you some free play time (a month with UO)
to try it out before you're committed to a recurring monthly charge.
