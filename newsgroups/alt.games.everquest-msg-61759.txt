> There's a beastlord trainer in Halas already, so they can go there for
sure...

  No, it just means barbarians will have the option to be beastlords (we
were told that the 'shamanistic classes' might have the option to be
beastlords in the early Luclin FAQ and it appears that this is true of at
least barbarians).  Obviously just because two races share a class doesn't
mean they're going to be welcome in each other's towns. :)  Dark elves can
be warriors, and Kelethin has a warrior guild, for example.

  My guess is that Kerrans will be KOS for sure in Erudin, Paineel and
Cabilis.  Their acceptance in other towns will probably depend on their
religion, but I'm willing to bet they'll be accepted in most of the
good/neutral towns.  And of course Kerra Isle. :)
