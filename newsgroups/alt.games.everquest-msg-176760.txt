The first thing I noticed in the OP's post was that he would be "playing
on his brother's account" for a while. If he has username/pw access to
his brother's account, I'm guess that the brother has/had access to his.

I agree that hacking an EQ account from the outside, while not entirely
impossible, is difficult and unlikely enough that it's basically never
the cause of these things.

To the OP: Listen, pal. If you have a brother (and/or any other friends,
relatives, guildmates, etc.) who play or have played at your house, OR
if you have EVER ONCE given out your username/password to ANYONE (and
this includes your mother) then you don't have to look very far to see
where your stuff went. What you do about it from here is, of course,
strictly up to you.

No, you don't have to post back here admitting that you gave out your
username and password, but let's face it. You did. Or (far more
unlikely) somebody was looking over your shoulder or has a keystroke
logger installed on your machine. But in any event, it's somebody close
to you. Get investigating, get your shit back, and immediately change
your password (and your username while you're at it) and stop letting
other people know it.
