no, the attempt was to annoy the person making the killfile.

Basically to say it's pointless.

But also to let him *KNOW* that I don't care.

If he killfiles me, he make think I'm totally hurt or something.  In order
to let him know that was not true, and in fact quite the opposite, I changed
my handle (actually, I should have changed my e-mail address--doh!) so I
could let that be known.

From this point forward, since I've made my point to him, I don't give a
shit.
