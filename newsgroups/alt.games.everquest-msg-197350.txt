My spell layout for soloing in PoP zones (no pet):

Malosini
Root (one of them anyway)
Chloroblast (Almost never use it, but it's permanently in this slot)
buff swap slot
Cann IV
Bane of Nife
Turgur's Insects
Kragg's Mending (gimp CH, again, permanently in this slot)

I pull with Malosini, root, slow, epic DoT, Bane of Nife.  Reroot and reDoT 
as needed.  Cann/Kraggs back to FM, repeat on next mob.

For soloing with pet in nonPoP zones (CT mostly)
Malosini
Root
Chloroblast
buff swap slot (swap in Celerity/bane of nife/Plague as needed)
Cann IV
Pet only buff (name escapes me, short duration, long refresh time)
Turgur's Insects
Kragg's Mending

Pull with root if more than one mob, Malosini if just one.  Debuff, slow 
all mobs, keep all but one rooted off.  DoT some keep pet healed with 
Kragg's.

For grouping
Malosini
Root
Chloroblast
buff swap slot
Cann IV
Alacrity
Turgur's Insects
Kragg's Mending

Unless there is an enchanter, in which case I dump Alacrity for the pet 
buff.  Don't DoT much, as, usually, group is going fast enough that slowing 
is a full time job along with rebuffing, spot heals, and root for crowd 
control, if needed.

I never keep SoW memmed.  For 99% of the mobs, strafe running will get me 
to the zone, if the shit hits the fan.  My buff slot generally has my best 
regen in it, when I don't need a different buff to cast.  After a painful 
lesson learned when I used to use my heal slot for a swappable buff slot, I 
never, ever, swap out a heal.  Until I got Kragg's, I only kept one heal 
memmed, now I keep both ready, always.  When I want to cast a DoT, if it's 
not loaded, I swap it into the buff slot, cast it, and swap back as needed.  
The DoTs last long enough that it's not a major issue.
