Its one of the only good animes to come out this year, im sorry if you
couldn't follow it but that doesn't mean noone else wont like it.  Maybe you
should watch the directors commentary to help you understand it.  I hope you
have seen the full unedited versions and not the shortened pieces of crap
they played on cartoon network recently.  Any true fan of anime doesn't
watch what is played on cartoon network, those bastards, but I do like
Sealab 2021, Home Movies, Aquateen Hunger Force, Mission Hill  and a few
others.
