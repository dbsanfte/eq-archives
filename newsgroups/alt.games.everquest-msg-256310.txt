When in Lilliput do as the Liliputians do, on the AGE newsgroup, any 
amount of observation will tell you we are overwhelmingly bottom posters 
here.

If you end up on the other side of the lake, in one of those newsgroups 
where top posting is the rule, then crack the top end of the egg by all 
means.

Posting the "wrong" way, whichever that is in a given newsgroup, is 
similar to driving on the "wrong" side of the road, which definition 
varies from country to country.

Then you have those NGs where posting is done randomly, some top some 
bottom... a lot like driving down a city street in Rome.
