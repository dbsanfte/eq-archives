Forever.

They never delete the characters and your login/password account will
always be there, with however many expansions enabled, with all
characters. You could come back in 2 years and it would be there,
you'd just have to submit a credit card number again.

They were going to delete all characters below level 2 who were not
played in a month, at one time, they never even did that.
