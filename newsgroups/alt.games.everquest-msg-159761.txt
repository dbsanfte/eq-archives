OMG! Don't say its so! EQ will end one day?!?! You are joking right?
I thought EQ was going to go on forever!

Captain Obvious strikes again. Do you stop people on the street and
tell them "You know the sun is going to set, don't you?"

EQ will end when it stops making money. That is when most the players
stop playing and the revenue drops off. EQ is a cash cow for Verant
why would they dump it when its still making money?

People have been predicting EQ's end was right around the corner ever
since beta ended. Been three+ years now.

Yup gonna end any minute now, any minute now.
