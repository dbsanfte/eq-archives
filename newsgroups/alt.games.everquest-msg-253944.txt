Those screen shots where taken from a zone that is currently in game .. it
is a zone that is built for you or your group to explore .. it is mainly for
show but there is a room od bats and a nother room of rats .. and as they
are geared to level (like ldon's) it might make a good place to group .. but
never tryed to hunt there ..

Speak to the person just py the start or the pier in nedaria's landing to be
granted access .. and you can gome and go indevenatly ( not timed ) clicking
on a rock in the 'bear caves' lets you in and speaking to the gide in there
lets you out
