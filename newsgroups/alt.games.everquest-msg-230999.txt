>I'm considering starting out in the game, having played AD&D in college
over 20 years ago... Will there be Everquest adventures online three years
from now?

If the investment of $30 for EQ Evolutions and $12/month is a question, run
now - a D&D fan will find EQ compelling and if that small an amount of money
is an issue you would be better off spending the hours on a part-time job.

If the main question is the games legs, so to speak, if it will still be
around in the future, I gotta say 'Yes', mainly because of the community.

EQ is taking on a life of its own, beyond the reach of SONY [much to their
frustration], and I think that is a good thing, and in retrospect an obvious
result IF the game is done right.  Just consider that it has created what,
to my mind, is the first 'real' virtual economy.  People are selling,
platinum, items, characters, and of course, information [although if you
have the time much of that can be had for free] in the real world for real
money.  Ebay has a section on it.  For those who question the significance
of this, consider that IBM recently announced they are developing software
to handle the economics for MMORPGs.

Moreover, just do a browser search for EQ sites [getting into the free and
for sale info mentioned above].  Look how many.  Consider the time involved.
In the spirit of TANSTAAFL, remember that time is money - this economy will
keep going.  That will keep the game going.

I am an old D&D player from college as well, and this has what I have hoped
for for years:  The right people.  The people in any RPG are, to me, more
important than the mechanics of the game, and you can hook up with the ones
that will make the game what you want it to be.

Do it.  Enjoy.

MStone
