I do. I have a tremendous memory and memorize most game
levels after only a few times thru them.

Problem is most people don't. I want it for the other people that
I have to constantly lead everywhere. And to stop all those people
that constantly shout for locations everywhere they go.

Yes. Glad you agree.
Its called a map. Cartography skill anyone?

Or get this how about a Spell! Magic! My character can teleport across the world,
slay dragon with spells, or Bring someone back from the dead but he cant draw
a friggin' map? Or buy one from some cartographer NPC? Gimme a break please.
