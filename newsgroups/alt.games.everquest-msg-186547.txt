If you want hardcore PVP with no crossteaming, then move to Sullon
Zek. I played there for nearly a year, and only moved because they
only allowed one character per account at the time, and I didn't want
to give up my character for something else, then started a new
character on FV and liked that char so much I stuck with it. If I
recall, you cannot change from PVP to non-PVP server anyway. Except
for going to Stormhammer, changes have to be between like rulesets. So
while someone on a blue server (except FV) can move to all other blue
servers, on Vallon Zek you can only go to Tallon Zek. You could not
even move your character to Sullon Zek or Rallos Zek. 

If you do opt to start over on SZ, then don't pick the evil team. They
comprise about 70% of the people on the server, so going evil is like
PVP-lite. If you want to be moderately hardcore, go neutral (20%), and
people who really like to suck it up and have a lot of targets go good
(10%).
