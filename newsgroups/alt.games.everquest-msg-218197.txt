If you want to use hot keys, and it's not a bad way to go, use

/stopsong
/cast #

For each hot key.

I played for a couple of years this way up to level 61, often twisting 4
songs at a time (5 if they are DoTs).

But recently, now that I raid more often, and want to play in LDoN groups,
I need more hot keys than just the
two left over  (1..8 were for song gems 1..8).  So I've switched back to
double clicking all the songs, but have changed
my keyboard mapping so that F1..F8 casts gem 1..8 (not Alt-F1..Alt-F8).
And I've moved the targetting that used to be
done by F1..F8 to Alt-F1..Alt-F8.

While there are some disadvantages to this, it does slightly speed up song
twisting because there is some inherent delay
in the hot-key with social setup that you can't avoid.  And it frees up all
my hot keys for other uses.
