Hail, friend!

My main is a 15th Warrior in the Halas / Qeynos area (though he is a
Freeport native). I still consider myself more or less a newbie, but I
think I can answer some of your qestions. BTW, I play on
Morrell-Thule.

My first (and only) magic 1hs weapon is a Langseax - Dmg 6, Dly 23 -
not too bad. I think it's part of a rogues quest, but people auction
them in Everfrost. The guy I bought mine from wanted 25pp, but I
offered an HQ bear pelt and he took it.

I also picked up a Langseax of the Wolves - 2hs, 19/44, +5STR, +5DEX -
from an auction. This guy was asking 100pp. I gave him 2 HQ bear pelts
and 50pp. I'm not sure what the going rate for this thing is, but I
think I got a fantastic deal.

Never played a Shaman, but I think there is a vender in Everfrost
along the north edge of the map almost to the river that sells Shaman
spell.

My 15th Warrior is still wearing his full suit of banded. I think this
will last me a bit longer. I'm not sure where I'll be going after this
or when. Prolly not gonna improve it till I start making FS plate -
"Real Soon Now".

Druids and Wizards various teleport spells. I think all spell users
also get Gate which they can use to teleport back to their bind point.

Blacksmithing is a great skill. You can make a profit at it, but it
takes a pretty good investment (about 200pp before you can start
making / selling banded). I mastered Smithing in Freeport, then moved
to the Halas area to market banded amour. I'm up to about 140 or so
now. There are a lot of adequate smithing guides out there, but all
you really need is a trival chart. Just find the next cheapest thing
to smith that has a higher trivial rate then your current skill and
make it 'till it's trivial. Repeat. Good trivial charts can be found
at www.eqtraders.com.
