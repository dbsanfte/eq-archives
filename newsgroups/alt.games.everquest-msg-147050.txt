I disagree, but I see a tradeoff.  I think spirocs are better.  But
only if you have the right utilities (c3, good +int/+mana gear).  I
don't think a level 44 wiz could do it without either of those.

Here's my case:

(1) Ulthorks are too spread out.  Takes a long time to gather up
ulthorks, as they wander all over.  And there is a LOT of room to
wander there.

(2) Different mobs are mixed in.  Walruses will aggro you
automatically, as will a hippo crossing through an AE spell.  I think
it's better to have all of the same mob for hp/run speed/social
habits.

(3) Snow bunnies.  They've got huge fangs and pointy teeth, and we're
not equipped with the holy hand grenade of antioch.

(4) Ulthorks give less exp than spirocs, and at 44, are just about to
turn light blue (if not already).  Here's the listing from allakhazam,
and it is pretty well known that higher level mobs = higher exp
reward.

 A Spiroc Lightfoot  35 - 37  Monster  
 A Spiroc Proven  39 - 42  Monster  

 A Ulthork Man o War  40 - 42  Monster  
 A Ulthork Warrior  34 - 36  Monster  
 An Ulthork Hunter  30 - 31  Monster  

I suppose you could make the case for quadding these mobs, but their
loot sucks:

 A Wooly Mammoth  32 - 38  Animal  
 A Wooly Rhino  35 - 41  Animal  

(5) Loot is debatable.  With spirocs, I have a guaranteed income +
research components, but no hope for winning the lottery.  With
ulthorks, it's a lottery ticket.


The tradeoff would be twofold: Spirocs don't support too many campers
(2 or 3 hunters should keep tree clear) and the level 44 wizard must
be well equipped to take them on.  I don't see the faction hit as a
negative, who needs spirocs of TD faction?

If you are on the Quellious server, I wouldn't bother hunting the
birds in TD.  Apparently, on that server, the birds have taken flight
north for the summer and will return when I ding 52.
