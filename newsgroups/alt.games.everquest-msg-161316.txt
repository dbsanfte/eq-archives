On the sixth freaking try, the dragon Trakenon fell to our forces and we
got our very first bard epic.

Thanks so a new, ingenious, brilliant strat I developed (*COUGH* Stolen
from Martin *COUGH*) we took Trak down with 32 people when we had
previously failed with 42.  Dropped the bard epic piece and a druid BP,
and we got Jumpy's robe and some cool spells in the process.

All in all a good day. :-)
