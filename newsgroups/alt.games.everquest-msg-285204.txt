PoR and TSS.  PoR isn't included with the current titanium set.

Beside the CD's mostly useless when they go to print because of
continuous bug fixes and improvement.  You're going to have to
download a number of updates when you register the latest set.  If you
have a friend with up to date EQ set or are getting the set for
multiple accounts, it's easier to copy over up to date EQ folder than
to buy the CD and run patcher for 3 or 4 hours. (more on dialup)
