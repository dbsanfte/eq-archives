Flame me if you want, but this is complete and utter fucking bullshit.
Yes, maybe it's wrong to limit someone to 10-15% of an expansion when
they've paid for it like everyone else, but COME ON!!  The time for a
change like that is a week or two after release, not SEVEN FUCKING
MONTHS or whatever it's been, christ!  Suuuuure, they're claiming
there will be a reward, but what reward can make up for the hours and
hours I spent sitting on my ass in the trials room, waiting to be
rotated into an attempt at flagging, only to fail.  How do they give
me those lost hours back? 

And don't get me started on what PoV/PoS, Tactics, etc. are going to
be like now, jesus....someone on my server message board suggested *at
least* implementing a level 55 requirement before entry... *sigh* I
hate to sound like bitter old man telling stories of what it was like
in the old days when I had to walk to school through waist deep snow,
uphill both ways, but there *had* to be another way, besides
eliminating the flags altogether, and throwing the doors to the zones
wide open....some kind of test/challenge...ANYTHING!
