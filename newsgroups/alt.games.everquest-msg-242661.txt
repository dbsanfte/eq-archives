If so, only marginally.  I don't know if they re-nerfed pacify or not, but
when I was playing it sorely needed it.  IMO it was sickening how effective
it was.

IMO, they can relax when the last body hits the floor.

Don't be silly.  This is Usenet.  Everybody argues everything.

Slow messages are pointless, unless (again) you don't trust that the slower
is doing his job.   Whether the mob has been called slow or not, it's still
the rate of decrease in the tanks hit points that you need to judge your
heal off of.

And before you mention resist aggro, calling resists instead of slows is
1/5 - 1/10 the amoutn of spam, and imparts the same amount of information.
Perhaps more, as an overused spam message gets mentally filtered.
