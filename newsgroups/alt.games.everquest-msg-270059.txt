1) I'm a he.
2) I never denied that I was a geek.
3) I only took issue with the implication that being a geek is a bad
thing
4) Girlfriendless? I'm engaged to a girl, thankyouverymuch.

So, while the geek part of the statement fits, the girlfriendless part
doesn't. The original statement used the term "geek" as an insult,
which it isn't. Not sure how I can "admit" to something that I never
denied...
