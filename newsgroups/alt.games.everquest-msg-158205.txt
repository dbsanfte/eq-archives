I didn't.  I accepted donations, but if I was going to port you, I did it if
you paid me or not.  I actually GOT a donation of any form about 20% of the
time at most.

I'll admit that some people USED the Druid class, and exploited it, but that
doesn't mean that there weren't ACTUAL druids out there.  People that chose
the class for it's own sake, and did their best to play it well, and to help
out others with their abilities.  I have NEVER killed a Wolf, or any form of
standard wildlife that wasn't hostile to me.  I don't care if it wouldn't
give me bad faction, I don't care if it has great treasure or fantastic XP,
if it's wildlife and it won't attack me, I won't attack it.

In other words, I play a DRUID.  People like me DO exist.

Maybe we had to lose the port monopoly because of those that exploited it.
I can see this, and I don't object to it.  It's probably a betterment of the
game AND the class in the long run.

It is also a diminishment of our utility and identity to some extent though,
and all I'm saying is that some work should be done to help us create some
new utility and identity to take its place.
