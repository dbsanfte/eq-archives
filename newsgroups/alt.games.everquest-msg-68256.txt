It's actually ridiculously easy to obtain.
The swords aren't very rare off the ape like things (Gorang-something)
and these are pretty easy mobs (well the scouts and bitchslap you if
you aren't careful).

The gatherers are soloable (and solid blue to level 60's--WTG
Alternate Exp Farming!!!).

Since it's a nice big outdoor zone (whose pathing bugs are already
becoming legendary), the standard collection of soloers are
permacamping that zone on my server.

And there appears to be a bug with some of the mobs in that zone:
None of them summon, and yes, I know only level 51+ mobs summon.  But
I'm talking about cons-yellow-to-a-level-57-enchanter mob that doesn't
summon.

That means even non-fear kiters can solo their hearts out in that zone
(well, the chain complete healing four arms in that zone can't really
be soloed).
