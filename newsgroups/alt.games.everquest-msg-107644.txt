Tough server to start on for your very first time in EQ.

On a non-PvP server, I'd say that North Ro would be a good place for you to
adventure.  Only down side is that you'd be kind of far from Druid and
Ranger trainers when you level (Kithicor Forest is nearest Ranger guild, and
Rivervale is nearest Druid guild).
