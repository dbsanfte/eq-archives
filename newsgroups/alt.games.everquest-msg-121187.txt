You are assuming that was the way it was intended to work Dan.  It mostly
seemed to work that way, not always.  VI has now stated that the fact that
it stops running while offline is a bug that they are not fixing yet.  Maybe
that's not a change, but a clarification.  Maybe it's just a way for them to
ignore a bug (that it should always stop running while offline), they have
stated how it is supposed to work now.
