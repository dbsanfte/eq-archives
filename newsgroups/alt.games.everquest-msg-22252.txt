 But in the meantime it's good for root parking. If the enchanter can't
get a mez off a well timed root will allow him/her to back up and do the
mezzing. However, as mentioned, due to the damage component you should
only snare mezzed mobs and not root them. Basically this sort of stuff
is learned in a consistent group and people know what to do and when.
Pickup groups are a little trickier since everyone has their own ideas
about how they think things should be done.
