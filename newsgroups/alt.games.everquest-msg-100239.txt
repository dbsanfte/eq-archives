Hahaha thats not to far from the truth, but in less then 2 years this entire
system will replace the garage system, I have been been winging it for a
while now, I have a Voodoo4 4500 in it now, and truth is it runs everything
even in XP just fine, the only game I really have troubles with is Quake3 if
that worked I would just replace the fan and keep the card I have in it
now.. I thought instead of spending more money on this system I would
upgrade the video card.. The Geforce4 4600 Ti is an great card but more then
I wanna pay, and also would not help my system ( or rather) is more
powerfull then the system I have now could really take advantage of.  :(  so
I am now split between the Geforce4 460MX and the Geforce3 Ti200  ( I know
the 500is faster) but again wanna stay in a resonable price range. and not
get a card that I couldn't take full advantage of..  Anyway Everquest is
calling my name I feel drawn to it..
