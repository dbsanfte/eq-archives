If all* the Druids and Necros hadn't been so thoroughly brainwashed
and bullied into soloing (and now the Druids get fed that oh-so-sweet
KEI-candy which reinforce this by making them as good at soloing as
the Necros) you'd see groups with multiple DoT casters, a decent tank,
and an adequate healer (Druid/Shaman = DoT caster who can heal) doing
just that, crushing mobs swiftly with most of the damage coming from
the casters.

(*) ok, ok, it's not "all", it's "most of" or "nearly all" or somesuch.
