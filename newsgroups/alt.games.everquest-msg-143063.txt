There are two other variables:

First, vendors have an intrinsic 'greed' variable.  There are a few 
vendors for which the best price achievable is higher than the next vendor 
over, even if they're on the same faction and your charisma didn't change.

Second, vendors sometimes give discounted rates if you trade with them a 
-lot-.  This usually becomes noticeable during tradeskilling, when you've 
been buying and selling from the same merchant for a long time, and 
suddenly the prices change in your favor by a couple silver.
