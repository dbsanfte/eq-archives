conspiratorially whispered:

You posted a fucking pyramid scheme you dumb twat. That's illegal in
every civilized country. Your "woe is me" apology maybe duped a few
people into some sympathy but you're still a spammer trying to get
illegal money from other people.

You're just less intelligent than most of them, who know better than
to get caught.
