I wouldn't, and nowhere.

Rogues shouldn't be powerleveled, UNLESS you already
have played another melee character to 55+.

Why? Because you'll never learn effective aggro
management, and could end up wiping a group of
folks that figure a level 60 rogue isn't going to go
Duelist 2 seconds into a MT's "Attack" call.

Or you'll end up getting your party stuck deep in
Sebilis or VP when the other rogue leaves and you
ask "What are these 'lockpicks' you folks keep asking
about?"
