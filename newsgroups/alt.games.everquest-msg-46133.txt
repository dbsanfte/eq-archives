Rogues are probably among the most overpowered class in the game right
along side warriors.

If you honestly think a warrior stands a snowball's chance in hell of
matching a rogue's damage output, you have absolute shit rogues.

Our level 60 rogues out damage our best equipped warriors by such a
huge margin, it's sickening.

And these are warriors armed with primal and Kreizenn's Flame/Katana
of Pain.
