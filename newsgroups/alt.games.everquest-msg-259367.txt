I just upgraded my computer.  From a 1.5G CPU to a 3.0G CPU.  From
512m of ram to 1gig.  From a P4T asus MB to a P4C800.  And lastly 
from a geforce3 video card to a geforce FX 5700.  Now when I run EQ,
it crashes to the desktop.  I made sure I was running the recommended
version of the drivers and reloaded direct9X, but it still crashes.
The only way I was able to get it to run was to set my video res to
standard VGA (640x480) and then run EQ.  

any clues?

thanks,

Robert
