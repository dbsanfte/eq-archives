	No, I'm simply incapable of understanding why you're such
a fervent apologist for such obviously flawed service.  It would
be one thing to argue that the problem isn't as bad as all that but
it's quite another thing to argue that there isn't a problem at all.

	So how much downtime *is* acceptable?  What do *you* consider
to be the limit of something to whine about versus an honest complaint?
