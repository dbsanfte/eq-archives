Focus items are effective on pets from level 4 to 49
They are practically useless on pets over level 50.
I only use them them for the stat buffs and reclaim effect.

FYI....
Most folks don't know this, but you have the focus in your hand,, ie, on the cursor
when you summon pet.
Most people think if you just have it equiped you get the benefits of it. Nope!!
