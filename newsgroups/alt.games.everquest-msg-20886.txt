    My old guildmates still remind me of my "lucky find" - full backpack
with all Rubicite pieces, including BP, at a time when Rubi was peaking in
price. Someone must have thought the higher reaches of the wall in WC was a
safe spot - it wasn't.

    The way I get around that is to use Inns where someone has to go through
multiple doors to get to my drop spot, and I close all doors behind me. If
when I'm starting to drop items I hear a door open, I abort.

    This doesn't happen often, though. Most of my characters are scattered
all over the place. To get twink gear / tradeskill supplies back and forth I
usually use a friend's druid. I try to use (quest)-style language to make it
mildly fun, and usually give her the twink's old gear for her own twinks.
She now likes seeing that her faction standing with Mulva has improved.
