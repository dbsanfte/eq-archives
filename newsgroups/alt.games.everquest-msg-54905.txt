On PvP servers, people will kill you for the thrill. Personally, I'm
one of those people. Each to their own I guess, although it's not like
I'm killing a bunch of people who didn't want PvP (hello? pvp
server?).

You'll find a wide variety of attitudes on the various PvP servers.
Rallos Zek is mostly non-PvP, ie most people won't attack you ever.
Sullon Zek is quite crazy, forget about roleplaying there, your main
aim is to grief/train/whatever your opponents (from the time I was
there that was the case, anyway). A few of my friends delevelled a lvl
59 evil bard to 54 because he fell asleep at his bind spot. All
unrezzable deaths except for the first death.

I've never really played on Tallon/Vallon so I can't really comment on
those.

And as for powergamers, you'll find them on PvP servers. There was a
bunch of people from an "uber" blue server guild who started on Sullon
Zek, they got to 60 really quick (like <2months if I'm not mistaken),
and within a few months of that half of them were running around with
epics. Right now, they are farming ToV and sleepers, go figure.

If your idea of PvP is roleplying PvP, stay away from eq pvp servers
altogether, you'll only be disappointed in the long run.

Oh and if you start on Sullon, prepare to be anally raped for about 50
levels. I started a char on SZ when it opened, played about
6-10hours/day for a few weeks, got to level 27, and a bunch of
powergamers would run through the newbie zones killing everyone they
saw (being what, level 30?40?). Incase you are wondering how they
levelled so fast, they had it all planned out before the server
opened, ie perfect group set up, and they rotated the accounts (so all
the characters from the group were logged on 24/7 getting exp with
various people playing them).

Up to you, but PvP is no joyride, and if you go into it with the
attitude that "you cant kill people because you want to!!" then,
whether you are right or wrong, you WILL be disappointed and end up
pissed off.
