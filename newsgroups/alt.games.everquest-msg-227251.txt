Hmm.. don't really agree with you here.   Auctioning does have its problems,
sure, but the replacement system you proposed would seem to have two
important drawbacks, both with the high points people and the low points
people.

At the high point end you're talking about points hoarding.   Everyone pays
the same price, so people who have been raiding longer and built up very
high point totals are always getting thier items first.   Everyone that
needs the upgrade has to pay the same price, so the gap is not reduced by
the high points person getting thiers first.  There is never any chance to
catch up and get the "good" items, since you can't attend more than 100% of
the raids (that you are flagged for).  If the guild suddenly breaks into a
new area, like Vex Thall or PoTime / Elementals... the points leader could
concievably buy every single drop at many raids, before he gets down to a
level where somoene else has a chance of taking one from him.

Sure, the much later people pay less for the drops... so that lowers the gap
a little, if  you're still killing the thing.  But a bid system you
generally start paying less on every successive drop.  The first one might
go for 140 points, the second for 125... third and fourth for 100, down to 1
point for the 15'th when that drops three months later.

Second problem is rots, unless you had a way to deal with that that you
didn't mention.   Charging someone full price for a minor upgrade seems
silly, when the alternative is having the drop rot and nobody gets it.  In a
bid system, this doesn't happen, since if it is not a major upgrade, people
will not bid "full price" for it.   Only those for whom it is a big upgrade
will go all in.    Another problem along the rot line is someone for whom
the item is a major upgrade, but he does not currently have the points to
buy it.    Maybe he just bought a different upgrade that wiped him out.
Under your system the drop would rot on the ground, even though it is a
major upgrade... and you would come back some other time to hope the mob
drops it again when this member has built his points back.  Under a bid
system the drop would go to the member for reduced points, and the next raid
time we can move on to a bigger and better target.
