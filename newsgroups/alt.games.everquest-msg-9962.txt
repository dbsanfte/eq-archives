Oh, I might hit Autoattack but when I do I don't expect to get more than 10
points a minute (in other words, just as a joke).

To answer your questions, my enchanter is level 51.  I regain my mana very
easily...clarity does that.  The spells are cheap to cast, so clarity does a
pretty good job of keeping up (good enough...more below).  My weapon doesn't
proc, it's right-clickable and only handy at merchants.  No, I don't garou
myself unless I'm just fooling around (and if I'm in a group actually
hunting I'm not going to fool around with a spell with a 3 minute recast
time and 6 minute lasting time).

I have clarity.  I'm at 80% mana or better, and I can chain-cast stun for
over a minute on a single bubble of mana.  Because I used a bubble of mana
on doing something that doesn't noticeably piss of the critters it means
that the cleric doesn't have to heal nearly as often as he might.  Since the
cleric doesn't have to heal, HE won't be aggroed.   Since the cleric doesn't
have to spend his mana on heals it means we're ready for the next fight that
much sooner.  How cool is that?

Plus, I'm "ready" usually at 30% mana in the same fights that I feel
comfortable if the cleric has 70% or more mana.  I always save enough mana
for 3 attempts at mezzing...and if I'm OOM after mezzing I sit my butt down
and WILL have enough mana to re-mez if needed.
