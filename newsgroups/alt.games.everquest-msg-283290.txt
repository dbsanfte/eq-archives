Nektulos have been changed for quite a while and is a lot uglier than
the original version.  Version 3 is on test now that looks more like
the original Nektulos with updated graphics.

Freeports, North Ro, Oasis, and South Ro have been revamped as well.
There is no more North Freeport and the Sewer is separate zone.  The
new Freeport looks a lot bigger and the new harbor actually looks
lively and busy not the old harbor was.  But I get lost there and the
find still don;'t work right :(

Oasis and South Ro have been merged into a single zone and looks much
nicier alomg with north ro.

There will probably be more zone revamps, possibly around the middle
of Antonica since the next expansion is rumored to be named serpent
spine, which is the name of the river that runs through the middle
from a lake near Everfrost (you'd need an old map that was included
with early games to find the river as they were never in live)
