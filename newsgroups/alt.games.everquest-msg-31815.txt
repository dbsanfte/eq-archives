No, I don't petition anyone for camping a mob, there is no rule against
camping a mob.  I also don't attempt to force someone to share a camp with
me, although that would be within the rules of the game.  Just because the
rules allow me to do something doesn't mean I MUST do it.  If someone were
to attempt to make me share a camp with them, I would either share it with
them, or leave and find something else to hunt.  And just in case you really
care, no, I didn't tattle on everyone in school, I was far more likely to be
the one tattled on.
