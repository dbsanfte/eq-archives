Having someone online likely takes grossly more resources in terms
of memory, CPU, and bandwidth requirements.  If offline trading
were allowed and it was handled by Trader NPC's then chances are
the 500 trader limit could be raised.

I suspect some people (perhaps including you) don't understand my
idea.

You walk up to a Trader NPC.  You right click.  You then click
"Sell Items", "Buy Items", or "Gimme my Money".

If you click "Sell Items", you get a window which allows you to
transfer items to the Trader NPC and set prices on those items.
You can then go exp, tradeskill, quest, or logout entirely.

Presumably, at some later time, you return to the Trader NPC
and right click.  You select "Gimme my Money".  If your items
have sold, you get some nice pretty platinum.  If not, you can
walk away and check back later or take your items back from the
Trader NPC.

If you click "Buy Items" you can, obviously, buy stuff.

A small handful of Trader NPC's could handle all the buying and
selling in Norrath with ease, much like now Banker NPC's work.
