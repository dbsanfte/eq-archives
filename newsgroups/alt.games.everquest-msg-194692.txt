You assume he's still there.

I assumed (perhaps foolishly) that he wasn't, since trolls moved to Neriak.

One of us is right.

Of the two of us I'm by far the more foolish, though, since I actually needed
something off him, while you're just trying to be helpful

I think the Everfrost guy will sell to anyone, as well, but without
invisibility I wasn't able to get my Iksar from the book to him, since there's
that trio of barb gaurds with Frostbite covering one exit, and Brand (who I
happen to know sees invis) covering the other.
