I just placed a bet for $1000 on the Raiders winning by over 3.5 points
tommorow, I could use the money to help pay my legal bills so that I can
continue God's work so I know that I will win the money.

Anyway, I was rewarded quite handsomely financially for doing what God told
me to do today and for proving that I had faith and patience and an interest
to learn more about the Bible, my goal of being able to prophesy for 3.5
years to the world in an antagonistic manner in the spirit of Rev. 11 may
come to a reality after all.



Sounds to me like u just lost 1000 dollars, thats a pretty handsome
financial
reward, eh? What's with the 3.5 refrences are u hung up on the size of your
little
friend or something, don't worry someday you'll find a woman that loves you
for your
car and not the size of your ,um, little fella.
