Yes. Chances are, someone I meet in EQ shares at least one interest in
common with me. Personally, I don't see how meeting someone in EQ or
any online forum is that different from meeting someone in a bar...

Engaged to someone I met via EQ. We knew each other and talked a lot
over the course of 2 years, sharing gripes about our relationship
troubles, and eventually realized how much we had in common. We
arranged to meet (no small accomplishment, given we lived on opposite
sides of the country), spent some time together, and I wound up moving
to be with her.

Never been to a fan faire.

Well, given my answer to the second question, I'm sure you can figure
out the answer to this yourself.
