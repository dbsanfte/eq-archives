An interesting thought. I'm betting that the delay timer on the weapon
*is* stored. Whether it's only stored until the timer runs out, or until
the next attack, is another question.  But it must store it somehow.
Othewise, people would get some weapon with big damage but an ungodly
awful delay up in the sixties or seventies, and proceed to just turn
autoattack on and off and on and off, thereby reducing the delay time
significantly.
