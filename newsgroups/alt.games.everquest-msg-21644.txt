Most annoying puller I've grouped with lately was proud of the fact that he
could get the group out of mana.. well, when I'm pulling I'm not "trying" to
get everyone OOM. I do pull harder if the cleric is constantly at 80%. I'd
rather have nice constant pulling and little downtime, and most people I
group with seem to feel the same way.

(still talking about Dreadlands here.. dungeons are a whole other ball of
wax)
