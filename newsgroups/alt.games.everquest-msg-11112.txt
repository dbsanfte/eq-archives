"Scott T. Jensen" <stj@home.com> wrote a lot about pro's and con's of the
cleric class, but it was snipped in order to fit in the Usenet format.

What you talked about, in my opinion, is just common courtesy some players
exhibit.

As a bard, I hear constantly, Mana song, mana song, Damnit sing your mana
song.  As calmly as possible, which is tough for me, I reply that I am
twisting mana and restoration during Down time, because the druid or cleric
is always out of mana.  They just need to turn bard songs on to group,
because there is no icon, just words.  Deal with it.

Of course, I also have gotten more and more jaded as I have played and have
no tolerence for idiot members.  If the cleric is oom and hitting at the mob
instead of medding, damn straight I am going to tell him how to do his job,
and if he doesn't he's gone.  If the paly or ranger is carrying the weight
of healing because the cleric doesn't grasp it, I will boot out the cleric.
We're better off keeping the paly and ranger and getting an sk or another
warrior.

If a warrior pulls after the chanter or healer has said lom, wait a few or I
have said, need a rest, my hand is going to fall off, from twiting during
down time as well as during batle, I will drop them.

I die enough on my own, without having the help of someone else.

All Clerics aren't nice and good, and all sk's aren't evil and mean.  It's
the players behind the characters who are nice.  I have gotten a lot of
things from strangers and friends, but the rule is simple, pass it on when
possible.  When I give things away, the caveat is that they pass it on to
others when able.

I have run out of my way to sing my mana song for a group of people who were
begging for a chanter to join their group.  I have run 2 zones past my
destination, because a player couldn't sow, and I could selo's them.  I have
spent over an hour, helping someone find a corpse stuck high on a wall in
Felwithe.  I don't accept donations, I simply ask that they pass it on.  I
am not a cleric and yet, I just bought a shaman his level 14 spells, he was
binding at a city, taking donations which were more than likely rare or
stingy.  All he had to promise to to sow anyone who asked, just ask them to
come to him.  Not a shabbie trade.

If I am in a city (With the exception of Gfay and Woodelves because of the
fact people play the female woodelf just to get shit, ironically enough, I
am a woodelf and female.) and I see a newbie stumbling around the newbie
are, I will take the time out to help them out a bit.  My rule is never
plat, just the items.  Yeah that shaman could have sold his spells back, but
he would have gotten such a fraction it probably would be worth his time.

Every class has it's pros and cons.  Play a bard and when the PL is low and
you can twist 4 songs instead of 3, someone will tell you how to twist.
That if you stop the regen song sooner it is more effective.  That you need
to twist in 3 songs during rest and during battle and then when you are
moving.  I mean, why shouldn't I be able to twist 3 songs all while leading
the group to a new camp and constantly having to circle back because they
don't comprehend that unless someone else leads, I will out run them.

There are tons of pros though.  The player who buys my next few songs
because I sang clarity for him at the city gates before retrieving my
corpse.  Or the Paly who asked me if a rev was ok because I spaced out and
didn't get a bind and was in EK while bound in Erudin.  How abotu the necro
on my server who gave me 800 plat and buffed me nicely and kep me alive
while I killed a kodiak.  I was level 4 and had run to help someone else.
He's a neco, not a clerc.  Or what about the necro who summoned my corpse in
The Hole after I fell in, much to my chagrin.

Characters are good and nice, because the players are good and nice, not
because of their class, yes even if they roleplay.  I can be as effective
playing a paly as a cleric can be.  Several times, it has been a paly who
has saved my sorry ass from one of its many deaths.
