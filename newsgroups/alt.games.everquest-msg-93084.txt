I've done this a few times and have a seperate hotkey page set up for it.
The important thing to know is, you only have to have the instrument on when
the song starts.   When twisting, for example, a percussion song, singing
song, and string song, I will do this:

Have string instrument on cursor, percussion wielded;
pulse percussion song;
pulse singing song;
click on instrument slot, thereby switching instruments.. percussion
instrument is now stuck to cursor;
pulse string song, switch instruments, repeat.

You can get into a good rythym and using instruments for all of your songs
really increases your effectiveness.  If you're over 30, you can start with
amplification to beef up your singing song quite a bit.  Of course, most of
the time at least one person in the group will ask you why you're not
meleeing.
