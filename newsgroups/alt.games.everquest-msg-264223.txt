Just a little side-rant regarding Blizzard/WoW...

One would think they will have fabulous support, but the overall flavor 
I get from beta is that Blizzard are cheapasses.

Blizzard's patches during beta have been around the range of 700MB, 
300MB, 250MB, and so on.  Distributing said patches uses a custom 
"Blizzard Downloader" which uses bittorrent as its core.  Great in 
theory!  Saves them a ton of bandwidth.  I understand, its beta.  No 
revenue.

Then came the post on their forums that said they will use bittorrent 
post-release.  Nevermind the fact that lots of people complained they 
can't use any p2p software (college campus, and some people complained 
about the upload rate saturating all their download bandwidth, etc.)

The last patch was around 250MB and was just horrid on dialup.  Finally 
(a few weeks later) I took a laptop to Kinkos to download it.

I would hope that if they have that kind of revenue stream on release, 
they won't be cheap bastards with their bandwidth and provide direct 
downloading like Sony does for EverQuest.
