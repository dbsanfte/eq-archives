"I am an avid tradeskiller" translates in my brain as "I'm a masochist,
hurt me please!" :-P

Maybe because the one time I tradeskilled was back before you could ctrl+
click single items off stacks.  If it hadn't been for the bug that left
my bard naked and penniless, I wouldn't have done those hours of pottery -
in fact, despite the fact that it was unheard of PP per hour for back then,
I deleted my pottery mule the moment I finished re-equipping.
