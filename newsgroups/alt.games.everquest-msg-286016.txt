Like the honest, useful videos on YouTube.com showing you how to break into 
houses by defeating a deadbolt lock. I've gotta admit, I don't agree with 
those either. Regarding my use of the term, "Leech", see below.

Emphasis mine. Not sure what, exactly, it is you don't get. They profit 
from the design and distribution of methods used to degrade the intended 
in-game experience - the experience the the vast majority of the players 
buy in to when they subscribe - all to cater to the least noble intentions 
and to the detriment of the game's lifespan.

Perhaps parasite would have been a better word. My bad.
