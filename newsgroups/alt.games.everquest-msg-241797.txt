Triage, learn the word, take it to heart. Tanks exist to soak up damage 
while DPS takes down the mobs. Casters serve to provide DPS but are made 
of tissue paper. Tanks can put out very large amounts of damage that 
when combined with disciplines, weapons procs, clicky effects and buffs 
serve to keep the agro off the tissu\\\\\the casters. Our job is to keep 
the tanks tanking along. Sometimes we clerics have to take healing agro, 
or even step in and thwap a mob with our gimpness to get it off a 
caster. Someone WILL die in your group. Hopefully it isnt you =) Tanks 
other than the main tank can die, and casters will die if it is between 
a tank that can keep agro off me until i can pop a rez on a caster, or a 
caster. I cant battle rez anybody if something is hitting me upside the 
head=\ HoT spells are excellent for casters, as are blast heals like 
remedy/divine light.

Depending on the group style, you actually can keep your group up and 
not get agro at higher levels, mid 50s and up as you get better mana 
costing heals. Do keep in mind that you do need to be a touch away from 
the mobs when you heal, and never sit down immediately after...but a 
heal over time is fairly low agro, and something like celestial healing 
[level 44 spell, 180 per tick, 6 ticks, 225 mana] is great as it will 
slowly heal the casters damage when you get the agro off them. You can 
use the same spell on the non-main tanks also - it is great for rogues 
if they know their class and are good at staying behind the mobs=)

Wouldnt recommend the same healing tactics in raids as groups, they are 
VERY different...
