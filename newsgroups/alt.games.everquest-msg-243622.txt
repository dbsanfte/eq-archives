In another thread, I was thinking about a different way to add a new
race or series of races to the game: converting race on an existing
character, so that a human might become a skeleton or an elf become a
bain sidhe, or lycanthropy might infect a halfling (were mouse) etc.

The attraction of my idea was that instead of starting over to play a
new race (see my Vah Shir Bard, or my (now deleted) Froglok Warrior,
you could take your already developed character and change him.

Down side of that, as far as SOE is concerned, is that you wouldn't
have the long development chain working back up from first level,
which presumably keeps churning interest in the game for those of us
who aren't into spending years working on developing our already level
65 characters, pursuing the top end content.

Well, it occured to me that another, similar idea, might -not- have
that drawback; stolen from AD&D, multiclassing.

Or more precisely, from AD&D 1st and 2nd editions, Dual Classing.

A dual class human in those versions of the system (I believe 3rd
edition did away with dual classing in favor of multiclassing for all
races) would change over to a new class, stop advancing in his old
one, and start over as a level one in the new class, only with the
benefit of his old class/level's hp.  He was banned from using his
former class's abilities on pain of losing exp for whatever he was
fighting, until he'd surpassed his former class/level in his new
class/level.

OR there's the current multiclassing system, whereby class/level is
divorced from character/level, and your character level is considered
the sum of your various class/levels, for purposes of how much exp
you'd need to advance to the next level.

I'm not sure how practical Either idea would be in EQ terms, and
there'd surely be a lot of details to work out, but either way, or
some variant on the idea, might breath a lot of new life into the game
without increasing the level cap up past 65.

One interesting variant would be to keep the character level cap at
65, which would mean the 65 crowd would be cut out completely, but
those with characters -under- 65 could advance in new ways... for
example, I have a 61 mage, I could multiclass into a 61 mage + 4
necromancer... would that be enough to get me a low level snare and
fear?  Or my 57 bard could add 8 levels of Cleric... bard with root?

Or if the old Dual Class rules are in place, I'd have to work up 52
levels in a new class before becoming a shaman (51)/SK (52)... but
imagine the potential of someone with both sets of capability once I'd
reached that point!

Not that such a thing is ever likely to happen, but its fun to think
about.
