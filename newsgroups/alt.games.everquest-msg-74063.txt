Just because I've yet to comment on any LOTR threads...  I wanted to make
sure you all know about the song written about Bilbo Baggins.  It is called
'The Ballad of  Bilbo Baggins' and can be found on Audio Galaxy for sure, I
don't know about other places...hehe

I bring this up more because of the artist that sings the song...  You all
remember the Original Star Trek right?  LOL  A certain Green Blooded, Pointy
Eared Hobgoblin that we know and love sings this song.

My brother who collects vinyls (what are those?? hehe) actually has Leonard
Nimoy's album among his collection.
