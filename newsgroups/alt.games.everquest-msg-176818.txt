I've removed mine twice that way. Didn't even give a reason. Just keep
petitioning every time you log in (in case there's an invis GM on who
feels like dealing with it) and hope for the best. Then, when it gets
removed, just wait a bit and use the /surname command again for your new
one, assuming it's not a wierd one that also required GM intervention to
approve.

Yes, on Test it may take a bit longer, but hang in there.
