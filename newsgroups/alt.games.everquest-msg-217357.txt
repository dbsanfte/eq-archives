As a shaman, my rains are actually significantly more mana efficient than 
my nukes.  I am specialized in alteration, as that is most of what I 
cast.  I rarely have a mage focus for either DD or mana conservation.

Tears of Saryn 650 per hit for 450 mana.
650x3x0.8=1560
450x.875=394
3.96:1

Velium Strike 925 for 300 mana.
300x.875=263
3.52:1

With DD focus
925x1.1=1018
3.87:1

Best poison nuke
Spear of Torment 675 for 275 mana.
275x.675=186 (I have Ornate Gloves which give 20% savings on this spell)
3.63:1

With DD focus
675x1.1=743
3.99:1

Hmm, guess I need to get a DD focus IV and start using Spear of Torment.  
I honestly never did the calculations for Spear of Torment after getting 
my ornate gloves.  The one issue still would be the difference in hate 
generated by the DD vs the rain spell.

I usually choose to use my rain spell in xp groups when I have excess 
mana, as it is the most mana efficient, and rarely causes aggro, and the 
mobs usually die to fast to make DoTs worthwhile.  When soloing, I never 
use rains, unless I am farming greens that will die from one wave.

The other issue to consider as a shaman is that the rains are all poison 
based, whereas the best nukes are cold based, so, depending on the mobs 
resistances, one or the other may be more appropriate to use.
