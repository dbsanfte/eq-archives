Simple and effective. It might be harder for a smaller guild to come
up with five sponsors, but a single dissenting vote should be all it
takes, provided you already have trust in your current members. And if
you don't, they shouldn't be members. I'd also add a probation period,
such as my guild has, ours is one month. For the first month, a  new
member cannot recommend or sponsor any new members.
