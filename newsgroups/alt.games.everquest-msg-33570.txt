God i do wish for a corp decay here :))

My main guy is only level 19 and he bought the coldain staff at lvl 16
for 178pp at scars edge, pricey but that staff has been great

None of my level 1's have any nice gear, some have no more than what
they can buy for there own loot cash, i have 31 guys by now and most
of them will have to make do with killing bats/rats/snakes woushi and
other nasties that stand in there way :)

/Regards Berth that now also has bought AO
