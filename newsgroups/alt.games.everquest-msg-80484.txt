I practiced all of my safe fall running through OT and FM. You can
heal while you LFG.

Hand to hand is functionally useless to you as a rogue. If you have to
fight hand-to-hand, you're either going to die regardless or win
regardless.

If something is big enough to aggro on you, it's big enough to kill
you, HTH or not.

Yeah. Neither rats nor skellies are pickpocketable. Non-undead
humanoids only. The way I got pickpockets up ties into evade:

"Evade" is a rogue ability that allows you to lose aggro from a MOb
you are fighting. To use it:

Drop auto attack.
Hit hide
Hit auto attack.

I've just put my other trainable skills in there, so it's

Drop auto attack.
Hit pick pockets
Hit hide
Hit Disarm
Hit auto attack.

Which is mapped to A342A on my control pad.

Any skill you get after level 1 requires you to at least put one point
of practice into it before it starts to go up.

>6. At 13th I get duel wield.  When I use backstab I get an extra attack.  If

Dual wield, double attack, and backstab are all independent.
