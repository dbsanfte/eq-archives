One theory I've proposed in the past is that the "R"NG is taking
into account my facing, using it as a seed or something.

I've noticed that if I get a result I like (say a skill up) and
don't change my facing, I often get it several more times in a
row (say, more skill ups).  But if I change my facing, I usually
get results that match up with the odds.

So if, for example, I try a trade skill and get a skill up, I
stay right where I am and keep trying.  But when I fail to get a
skill up, I change facing.

Same for spells, if I get a fizzle I change facing, if I don't
get a fizzle I try to stay where I am (unless prudence dictates
moving).

Another factor that seems to change odds is that the First swing
I take at a mob is more likely to hit than subsequent ones.  This
apparant advantage was large enough that my cleric used to use a
large slow weapon, and turn attack off and back on for each blow;
he'd hit 75% of the time instead of about 25% of the time if he
just let it keep swinging.

So what I have to ask is, a) why not use a much better seed
generator, say the time in nanoseconds for example, and b) how
can we deliberately exploit the crappy one they have now until
they fix it?  I like b) and have been using it (insofar as the
positioning thing) happily, because I get the advantage of it
until repaired, and it seems that the odds of them fixing any
given bit of crappy code they have in the game are directly
proportional to the degree to which it favors the players.

If the streakiness is random, it doesn't really help or hinder
players.  But if the streakiness can be controlled, then it can
dramatically affect player success rates... want to bet they
don't bother fixing that?
