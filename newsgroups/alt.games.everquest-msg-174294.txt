The "GM" ( at 144, now, I think, and geerlock ) smith in our guild did his 
first combine on an Underfoot BP for himself.  It suceeded.  He's quite 
happy, no doubt.  There's probably not a shortage of Dwarven GM armorers, 
but I'm sure he can make some plat, now.

I also now have a source for the Ogre cultural.  Too bad I don't have any 
Ogre characters.

Great post, Mon.  I had a pretty fun weekend, myself.
