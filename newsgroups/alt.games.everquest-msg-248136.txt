The guards in question are Guard Heridion and...can't remember the other
skeletal guard. They are the guards at the newbie area. Coming from Toxx or
the top of the Hole, you go down the tunnel and emerge into the newbie area
that lies between the tunnel and the entrances to the Warrens and the Hole.
Those are the guards you hail to get the key (when your faction is high
enough). Anything less than indifferent, and you generally get insulted or,
if you're low enough level, attacked.
