You can by all probability scratch that one up to the old random generator
system..
If you roll a six sided die 6 times in a row statistics tells us it SHOULD
turn up a 6 once.
We all know this does not happend, and even if you roll it 60 times you
still might not have seen
one single 6 come up, because probability tells us the chance of it being 6
is just as good as it being 5.

Therefore you might roll those dice 600 times and STILL not have seen a
single 6 come up, it is most unlikely
but still possible.

And since loot spawns on mobs are generated by a random generator picking
from a preset list of possible item drops for each mob type it works the
same as rolling a die, maybe just not a 6 sided one but maybe a 10 or 18 or
23 sided all depending on how long the loot table for the specific mob is.

And add to that the old Murphys law and you sudently might have a vedry low
chance of getting the drop you actually need :))
