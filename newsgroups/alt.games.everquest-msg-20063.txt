Wow that exact same thing happened to a guy i know just a few days ago. i
almost thot you were him since he lost a bo staff too, he didnt say what
kind of Bo staff but only that he lost one. i myself dont use spirit pouches
or anything like that, im ok with being encumbered. altho i have a druid
friend that im around a lot that gives me strength of earth when i need it.
altho i know how being encumbered can affect a monk.... i feel bad for
you...
