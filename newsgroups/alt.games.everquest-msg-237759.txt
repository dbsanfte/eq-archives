 Well I have been told an Erudite SK is as hard as it gets. Bet I can tell
you that I have a Human SK that is 3 years old this Wednesday. He is KOS all
over, including the OT and Neriak, and though I don't play him as much as I
do my others, 3 years is extreme on one character. In retrospect, it was my
first attempt at EQ, and my very first character. I killed guards with him,
I sunk all his points in strength ignoring INT, and I put myself in a
position by failing to read first, then create. I was told long ago that no
one ever keeps the first toon.
 But I refuse to give up on the guy. He is now almost 53, he has more HP
then many SKs levels above me, and his armor and weapon is top grade. Not to
mention, his pet reached manhood finally and can actually contribute.

 In short, me and my SK have been through a lot together. You learn as you
go and the mistakes I made with him, I have not repeated with my Alts.

 But make no mistake. A Human SK is close to the top as one of the hardest
classes to level.

Just my two cents.....
