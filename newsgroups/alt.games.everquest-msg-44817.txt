I did the same with my Necro.  I finally left when I dinged 21 for a
Befallen raid, and never went back.  Not counting my Wizzie on another
server, that was my first character, and the 8pp for an Eye was awesome.  I
think I only ran into another person there once, and I showed them how to
get a free Harpoon and they were so estatic they left.  Better yet was the
endless supply of Halberds off of the Sisters for my skelly pet.  Sometimes,
he wouldn't wield it, though.  Never figured that one out.

Loot is not a priority at all with me right now.  My Chanter is my Provider,
and he's providing well for the moment.

I can swim.  As well as any other rock.  I don't even know if my swimming is
1.  I have some web work to do tonight, so I may log him in and put him in a
good "swim training" spot.  Anyone know of one in Oasis?  How about further
south of the SE Orc camp?  Can I swim against the wall there?

Actually, my swimming is 4, I think.  I sometimes would swim to pull crocs
in the water with my bow.  Plus, I always fight them underwater to get the
experience bonus!  ( heh, that belongs in the "Nostalgia" thread, I
guess... )

Thanks for the input.
