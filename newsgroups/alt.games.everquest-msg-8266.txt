This has been asked before, so if you can't find it on Allakazams or
something, you might try searching the old newsgroup messages.   Sorry, I
don't have the answer on me.

One way you can find out though is to go into the game and type /who all druid
50 60.     That will return all of the higher level different class names, as
long as one of them is on at the moment (and not anon).
