If you are looking for EXP Rathe is NOT the place to go Rathe has excellent
loot but the EXP is a bit weak. Echo Caverns in Luclin, Tazmak Caves and
Kodiak (<you are a bit low) caves in GD, Dalnir in Kunark, even SOL A will
be much better exp. HGs in Rathe Mts are some of the best looting mobs in
the game for Plat but exp is very low.
