Ok

I finally got my horse, and not one of those old swayback nags, mine is a 
powerful handsome steed.
Anyway, aside from the faster travel and numerous parade appearances, what 
other benefits dose being on a horse afford you. I.e., does it increase your 
armor or battle abilities when you fight from mount?

And.

I saw a player fly by me who had transformed into a bird.  My other 
character can transform into a bear, so I know about the shamen, but what 
class can turn into a bird and when?

Bonus question.  Long ago (2 months or so) within my first visit out into 
the wild of Antonica, I can across a player how had transformed into a 
unicorn.  Was that just a developer playing, or are there actually unicorns 
in the game?
