First, what is your datarate.txt file set to?  It's in your EQ directory.  
Based on your info, I would suggest using a setting of 5-7.  The 
possible settings are intergers from 1-9, basically depending on your 
connection speed.  
Second, do you cache textures?  It seems like you're downloading a bunch 
of textures or something, so you might want to play around with that 
setting.  
I've seen similar lag issues when I first log on, but I rarely LD because 
of them.  Play with your datarate.txt, and if you're still having 
problems, we'll try something else.
