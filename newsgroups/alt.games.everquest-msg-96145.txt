Did you also know that the cheapest horses are barely faster than
running speed and are a total waste of money?

Did you also know that they cannot be traded in or upgraded for a
better horse and you will lose about 2K selling it back?  

Finally, did you know that the money you save up to spend on a horse
could be used to buy an uber piece of gear for your character that
actually does him/her some good?

Isn't that cool?



>>Has anybody noticed that, while on a horse, you can track yourself?

>>Bizarre. =)
