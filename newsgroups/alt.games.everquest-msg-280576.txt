Three factors:

No new content in a while.  New expansion coming out should change that.

No newbies.  If you're new to the whole MMORPG thing, you're not likely to 
pick up EQ anymore.  WoW or other things will appeal more.

Fewer people playing EQ.  Simple fact-o-life: the numbers on EQ are way down 
from their peak.

And, to a lesser extent, fewer people using Usenet.  AOL stopped providing 
usenet access, as have a lot of ISP's.  (I actually pay $12 a year to 
Newsguy to use their usenet servers.)  These days everyone uses message 
boards.

But mostly, it's just that EQ is a slowly-dying game.  It'll keep going on 
inertia for a year or two at least.  I, for one, will keep playing it.  =) 
But of all the people I was playing with when I first picked up EQ, none now 
are currently playing.

Ah well, life goes on.  Whatever may be may be.  Pick your cliche.  =)
