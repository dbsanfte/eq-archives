Tak's Whistler is 11/22, and requires a Gem of Nimbleness
and some frontier mountain ore from goblins in Droga.  As
well as 500 pp to give to a dwarf.

Shaded Dagger is 11/22 with some +5 to all resists (except
Fire, which is -5 like all Shaded pieces) and usually costs
(on E. Marr) 500-1000, but have been dumped for 300 or so
from folks who spend a lot of time in those places hunting.
Like the centi weapons.  I remember when a 12/24 +stats
CSS was like 6kpp and was godly for an off-hander.  Then
the Centi SS came out, 12/25 +5 str/sta, and dropped so often
that it's hard to sell one for 450 pp these days.

The Whistler is nice (heck, my level 3 corpse mule in
the Hole has one...I had the quest components from my
main, and MQ'd 'em with myself), but it IS a lot of trouble
for an equivalent weapon if you just want to save money,
since it costs about the same anyways.
