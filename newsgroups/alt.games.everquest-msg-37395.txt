I actually keep a little note book beside my keyboard, and note the names of
people who act like this.  I keep several categories or lists, depending on
the action.  I found it necessary to keep track of people's reputations back
when I was a guild officer.

The habit of keeping a list of people's names got reinforced when I started
playing PvP.  :-)
