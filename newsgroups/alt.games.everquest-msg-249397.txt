The standard we are supposed to be using is that it is better for 10 guilty
men to go free then to convict an innocent man. Beyond any reasonable doubt
is another way of measuring it.

When this standard is not maintained we fail at what we are striving for but
striving for it we are.

We had a muder case here recently where the victims blood was found on the
defendant, found on the defendants car, found on the defendants clothes .
Where the defendant had no alibi . Where the defendant acted strangely
before and after the murder. Where the defendant had a previous history of
abuse towards the specific victim. He was found innocent because one of the
arresting officers made a racial slur 10 years previously and it was just
barely conceivable that the officer might have manufactured some evidence to
keep the defendant in his place, though no evidence of such manufacture was
ever found.
