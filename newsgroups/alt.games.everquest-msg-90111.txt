I like shamans because they are so versatile. They can solo well, and
they are welcome in groups. It's a fun class to play because it can be
succesful using a large number of strategies. Solo, they can kite mobs
with sow, or root/dot them, or melee using slows, or combinations of
all 3. In groups they can play healer, or damage dealer, or debuffer.
Shaman is a nice class.
