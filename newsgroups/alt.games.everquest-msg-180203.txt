First, I have to appologise any bad language that might follow. 
Second, I know nothing about African, so my post will stick to the
Asia side.
What the hell is this?? Why people love to politicalize everything?
Norrath is a fantasy world. What does Gnome, Dark Elf, High Elf,
Troll, and etc. mean to you? Aren't they races??
Sweetie, to start with, Norrath is a Western fantasy game. In the
asian mythology, there are only 3 races, the human, the ghost/spirits
and the gods. The Gods are very much like the Greece ones where you
can actually find a god in everything. The spirits are those animals
who can act like humans after hundreds/thousands years of meditation,
or if they are hardworking enough, they can even turn themselves into
human forms (Hm...so that's where Sony got the player race idea for
Lizards, Frogs and Kitty?).
I hate people for being such a fussy over the political correct thing.
And what makes me sicker is even when do the Westerners try to add
some Asian content to their game, everyone will look as ugly as Mulan.
I'm happy with the Norrath races...so if you want to publize your
races ideas, probably you can advocate yourself into convincing the
Freeport guards not to slain my cutie Ogre warrior when all he wants
was just to get a decent meal there. I call that racist.
