Heh, you can't get to 6 on the island without killing quite a few 
greens, I did know that.  But the exp isn't much compared to yellow or 
orange, which is what I was used to going thru... and at 6, there aren't 
a whole lot of greens, principly the bosses.

Well, on first glimpse it looks nice, but its possible that being able 
to tailor missions to this extent will make them get old; I remember in 
LDoN's seeing group after group refuse to do anything but slaughters, 
for example.  Will AO groups refuse to do anything but 0% stealth, 100% 
good, etc. missions?

Well, I imagine you need to put some IP into the right spying skill, 
too, and perhaps Agility or something.

So far I'm not making much, a few hundred credits per mission (maybe a 
thousand at best); I've heard there are items worth tens, even hundreds 
of thousands sold to high level players who can no longer do the 
missions to get them, but haven't seen any real hint of that sort of 
commerce going on.  Is there any way to buy/sell besides auctioning in 
the OOC channel?

Aye, I keep meaning to get around to trying grouping, "as soon as I get 
this other thing figured out", only there are so many other things!

I didn't get an apartment.  Whats the point of that, more storage, like 
the banks?

Also haven't seen the info boxes or guides, odd that they'd hide them up 
there instead of putting them in the orbital station (where I expected 
to find them) or on the newbie island (where I spent quite a while 
banging my head against walls trying to figure out how to do some things)

And it explained how the skill works, or added to the skill itself?
40 credits?  I don't think I've seen anything in the game that cheap, 
unless maybe it was a vanilla shake and small fries.
