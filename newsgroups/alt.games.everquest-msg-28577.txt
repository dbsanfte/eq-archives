When Zavijah was level 7, she started a massive self death spree I am
not trying to wean her from. She is bound in EFp and was living and
dying in North Ro. After one of those deaths, she zoned into North Ro
and got a tell from a mid 40s cleric offering a rez. I declined, since
it was insignificant exp loss and I was in the same zone. Ran up,
looted my body, and got a truckload of cleric buffs instead :)
