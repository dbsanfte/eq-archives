Ha, bet you all thought this was a where to hunt question!

I took a couple of days off from EQ, and got to thinking about what a
time sink it is despite the fact I still enjoy playing. My enjoyment has
diminished quite a bit though, starting with the LoY expansion, then
turning from a downhill coast to an outright "over the cliff" feeling
with LDoN. So.

Will I go to EQ2, Not likely given what the current developers are doing
to EQ. I know they are different from the developers in EQ2, but they
take their direction from the same people at Sony. SWG, from what I've
read, is a major disappointment to most, therefore more fuel to the no
Sony decision aspect for my next choice of online games.

I liked the original EQ before the current dumbing down. I see no need
for the dumbing either. I regularly start new characters for fun, and
see so very few true "newbies" that I vehemently disagree with Sony's
current direction or "vision".

OK, finished with the rhetoric, and want to throw it out to you. What
new games sound interesting to you? What concepts would you take from
EQ, SWG etc., and combine to make a better EQ type game?
