I wanted to check out the free 1 week trial from soe website but got the 
message:
We're sorry, there appears to be a problem loading this website. You may 
need to enable JavaScript in your browser in order to continue.
So I checked and IE does have java enabled.  So I downloaded firefox, but 
got the same errormessage.  Any advice on how to get the free trial?
