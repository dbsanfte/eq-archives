Uh no. The term homophobe was applied to those who spoke 
out against homosexuality resulting in the politically correct,
who are scared shitless to say anything controversial, in fear 
of being labeled similarly and they clamed up regardless of 
how they really felt or what they expressed in private. The fact 
the word they were so afraid of is virtually meaningless apparently 
escaped them.

And can be renewed indefinitely under section 33[4],  5 years at a time. 
Yes, and I'll tell you why. I'm sick to death of us having legislation shoved
down our throat in this country. From our exchanges I would guess you
are in or around Ontario. Well we in BC and Alberta are moving
towards telling the rest of the country to piss off. So I would applaud
Alberta invoking the notwithstanding clause on virtually _any_ laws.
Quebec robbed English speaking Canadians of their Charter rights, and
the pricks in Ottawa did dick, but just funneled more of our tax dollars
into that pos hellhole. Three provinces pay all the bills in this country
and two of them, Alberta and BC are fed up and close to pulling the plug.

Yes I'm with you and it's completely erroneous. There never has been, 
is not now, nor given the federal governments position will ever be ANY 
reference to sexual orientation in the Charter, section 15 or otherwise. 

A soldier in the Canadian armed forces [ cpt Birch ] publicly proclaimed 
his homosexuality. He was advised by his superiors that by doing so he made 
himself ineligible for promotion, military postings etc. He decided to file
suit under the premise he was discriminated upon because of his sexual 
orientation. 

Birch's lawyers realized that the Canadian Human Rights Act didn't mention 
sexual orientation and devised a strategy which in effect said,  the absence 
of a declaration forbidding sexual orientation grounds for discrimination in 
sec 3 of the Canadian Human Rights Act was a violation of the equality rights 
guaranteed by sec 15 of the Charter.

The federal government's position was that, although sexual orientation 
wasn't one of the protected grounds listed in sex 15, it should be included 
by way of " analogy ". However they disagreed omitting sexual orientation 
from the Canadian Human Rights Act constituted discrimination. The gov't
said that while it can't pass laws that discriminate_against_homosexuals, 
it can pass laws that don't include protection specifically _for_homosexuals. 

The Ontario judge hearing the case, ruled in favor of Birch, expressing
the opinion that although sexual orientation wasn't specifically mentioned
in the Charter, it is an " analogous " grounds of discrimination. He then
went even deeper into his peanut of a helmet to conclude that because
the Human Rights Act doesn't mention sexual orientation it is in essence
saying discrimination is acceptable. 

A clause mentioning sexual orientation was included in the Human Rights 
Act somewhere down the road following this decision.

And so they should. I'm babbling about this on a bloody games 
newsgroup.

This is interesting, do you have a link to the story ?

lol. I didn't say a live hamster.

Yes I do. Do you want 30 examples of where the government and private 
sector would come up short ?

>Thinking present, since I have had a spouse by law since Jan. 1, 2001.

How can he be your spouse ?

Why did you snip the part I provided which would have made 
this question moot ? I specifically said financial factors are not
the most important consideration.

>Ah yes, god forbit we make people feel warm and fuzzy!  

We're back to that damn hamster again I see. Let it go--it's not
going to happen.

When higher purpose people get all warm and fuzzy I sit down 
quickly because you just know reason and the average Canadian 
are going to get it in the ass.

 I'll skip the
>debate regarding your 4% figure, at least until the census data is
>out.   Its a moot point anyway- even if the figure was as low as 4%,
>you're talking about 1,240,000 Canadians!

Which of course leaves 31 million on the other side of the plate.

Look, I wouldn't want to hurt or discriminate against any deserving 
group be it's size 100 or 1,000,000. I just don't think it's in the best
interest of the country to promote a homosexual agenda and don't 
believe the denial of same sex marriages constitutes discrimination.
