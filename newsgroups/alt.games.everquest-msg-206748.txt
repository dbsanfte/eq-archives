On the other side of the fence, leveling up a character to 50+ and then 
camping for hours for a rare drop item or for cash and buying that uber 
piece of gear does sometimes make you want to crow about it.  It -is- 
better than that 100pp item that the level 30 legitimately earned... but 
the two are competing in different forums.  "best twink gear" is a 
different category from "best earned gear" .  Luckily the response to 
having that 30kpp gear waved in your face is a depreciating "twink!" 
which should take care of well meaning friendly sorts nicely, and at any 
rate make you feel better about your more "honest" status.

The other part of this conversation, though, is when people are 
comparing the same sort of item.  If there are two weapons, one 10/20 
and the other 25/40, for example, and both are currently retailing at 
the same price, which is better?  While the ratio is better on the 
25/40, it won't aggro as much nor (in the hands of a higher level melee) 
do as much damage.  At low levels, the 10/20 will do far more damage due 
to the damage cap (both will do same damage but the slower one will do 
it half as often).  Considerations like this mean that one weapon may 
well be better than another for one purpose and in the hands of one 
person at one level, and the other may be better for a different purpose 
or under different circumstances.  Its possible to have meaningful 
discussions comparing items outside the "that took everything my 
character earned from level 20 to 30 to buy, while your item took 10 
minutes for your level 65 to get" spectrum.

Because the FBSS has crappy stats otherwise, while the SCHW aren't 
nearly so bad.  Replace your gloves with SCHW and you probably won't 
take that much of a hit in AC/HP/Sta, while replacing the FBSS with 
something good will probably jump you up noticably.  Yes, your haste 
won't go up much when you upgrade to an SCHW but you practically get a 
free slot for new gear.
