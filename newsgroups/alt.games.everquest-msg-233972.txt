I'm about halfway through the monk "shackle" quests, and was skimming
ahead a bit to see what sorts of things arise later.  I noticed that
the Monk "Whistling Fists" epic has a step where you give your top-level
shackle to an NPC and never get it back!?  Ow!  Sure, the epic reward is
a very nice HTH weapon, but the Shackle of Tynnonium looks like it would
be a very nice item also.

So it sounds to me like, if I want to have both the epic and the shackle,
I have to plan on doing the shackle quest series TWICE?  Once to get the
shackle that's used up in the epic, and once to get a shackle to keep.
Oh, and I might want to do it a third time, stopping at the next-to-last
shackle (since each shackle is Lore) since it's pretty good too, though
I imagine once I hit the high levels I can hope to find better wrist gear.

Frankly, the worst part about maybe having to repeat the shackle quests,
is that I'd have to start with the "penance" quest for people who've lost
their starting shackle.  I just read through that one and it looks really
tedious!  And if I want to be able to end up with two high-end shackles
and the epic I have to do the penance twice!

Am I missing something, or is this really the way it is?  Folks out there
who've done the Whistling Fists, did you just give up the shackle and say
oh well, or did you do the penance and repeat the quests to get it back?

I'm thinking that if I'm likely to end up repeating the shackle quests,
I might as well start running 2-3 sets of shackles in parallel (staggered
of course, since the shackles are all Lore), so I can do them more
efficiently.  Or should I just figure that once I've finished the epic
I'll find it a lot easier to go back and redo the shackles if I still
want them?
