Heh, had something like this happend to someone else. I wanted to buy 2 +5
cha bracelets.
The first bracelet which was put down was the one I wanted (right-clicked
it). While measuring my money I saw an identical picture of a bracelet being
put there. I assumed it was the same bracelet and continued the trade.
After a few hours I suddenly noticed that my cha was up more then I expected
so I checked the bracelets; to realise the second one gave me +7 cha instead
of the +5.

Honorous as I am I wanted to find the player again and point out the
mistake. She logged already and I haven't seen her the night thereafter.

Forgot her name, but it should be on a note here somewhere....
