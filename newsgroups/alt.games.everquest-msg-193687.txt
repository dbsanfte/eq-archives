As you've already found out, you need a different hide to make the combine.
Just want to add a few hints about tailoring:

1. You can train tailoring up to 21 a your guild master if you have some
extra training points.
2. Work with low end silks (spider, spiderling, shade, Shadeling)  until
they trivial because you never fail, and end up with a product you can
easily sell to other players.

Good luck, and happy tailoring,
Naphtoe
