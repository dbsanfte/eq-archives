To put this all in perspective I have three graphics cards atm.  A
Radeon 9600XT, Radeon 9800 Pro and a Nvidia 6800 GT.  Using thge
synthetic benchmark 3D Mark 2003 on my P4 3.0 Ghz with 1MB of DDR ram
they give the following results:

9600 XT just under 4,000 points

9800 Pro just under 8,000 points although I can get it higher by
tweaking.

Nvidia 6800 GT  11,781 points stock standard.

In my view the 9800 Pro gives the best bang for the buck out of all
cards in EQ atm.  Obviously when the prices come down on the Nvidia
6800s and the X800s they will be far better.

With the 9800 I could run with all options turned up and the only time
I would get a little lag was in a full scale raid.

The 6800 GT gives no lag whatsoever with everything turned up full.

I think you can do no wrong in getting the 9800 Pro it is a good card.
