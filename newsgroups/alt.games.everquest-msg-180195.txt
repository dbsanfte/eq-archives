I don't know but what is sure is that I saw many PC trolls trying to 
take back grobb hehehe, I just went there with my paladin to check my 
faction with gukta frogs and I saw these trolls "camping" the guards at 
the entrance. =p
Oh btw I'm max kos in upper guk and still amiable in gukta =)
(I know it's a shame for a paladin to be kos in guk but I really wanted 
my ghoulbane and there was no quest for this item at this time hehe =p )
