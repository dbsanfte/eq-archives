I am always seeing familiar faces. If you bother to look around you
can't help but see the same people if your play times are regular and
not sporadic.

The "level tedium" is really up to you. It's there if you want to
engage in it, but no one is forcing you to. Many players play to have
fun, and ignore leveling. Several posters in this newsgroup have
played since launch and never levelled a character past 30. Some spend
all of their EQ time buying and selling in the Bazaar amassing
fortunes that they never really spend. EQ is what you make of it.

EQ is a completely different game now. I wouldn't even know where to
begin when it comes to all of the changes over the last 3 years.

The Shadows of Luclin expansion includes updated textures for the old
world zones. These are basically higher resolution and look much
better. They are not different.

There are always low level characters around. On the older servers
many of them are alts (alternates) or twinks (loaded up with gear
earned by higher level characters). 

>Have the questing and story aspects of EQ been improved or are they still
>somewhat lackluster?

They are only "lackluster" if you allow them to be. EQ isn't TV or a
movie. It's more like a book. You have to use your imagination, and
put some effort into it. Don't expect everything to be handed to you
on a silver platter. EQ provides the frame work. You have to provide
the imagination.
