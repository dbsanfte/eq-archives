Not necessarily. Confession time:

When I was young and stupid I was a wannabe l33t d00d. "Cool" handle,
collection of phrack and 2600 magazines, you name it. Never did crack
or phreak anything, but it sure sounded cool. I thought of myself as
a hacker.

These days, now that I'm older and not quite as stupid, I'm a wannabe
hacker (In the good sense), and I dislike the newer usage of the word.
I'm resigned to it, though. Hard to change the accepted usage at this
stage.

Not saying that Jeremiah *isn't* old school, just saying that he might
be young and still know the "right" definitions.

Mmmm, thread drift...
