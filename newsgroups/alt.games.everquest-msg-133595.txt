Heh, Doomshade.  He owned us.  We went on a raid with another guild in UP,
just pulling what we could find.  Doomshade popped.  We discussed it a bit,
decided, we know he's going to own us, but, let's just see if we can dent
him, it will be fun.  Well, great fun was had by all, corpses were littered
about the zone area from ME.  His health bar did move though.
