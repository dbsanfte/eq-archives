Pathetic, just pathetic.

Not bad, and assuming FT works, really great from 36 on, when charm
starts costing mana

Pathetic but at least its not an orc fang earring level of pathetic.
Looted myself hunting in SS

This is useful for checking spawns or checking out areas I"m not
familiar with, the eye actually has a greater travel range than bard
track (caps out at 100).  There's no reason to actually wear the
thing 24/7 though, I could easily drag it out of a bag for the couple
times a day it sees use.

MM, this was fun, I made it in to loot this puppy at level 4 I
think.  No need to wear it although 13 cha isn't so bad perhaps.
Funny thing is, as a Vah Shir bard I'm a large race; this comes in
handy as a bard usable shrink device, in tight quarters a DE is much
more raid friendly.  This is at least my third character to have this
mask and the first to find it useful for anything but banking in
Ogguk once in a blue moon.

Nothing exciting, but decent enough I guess

Same

Invigor... oh that comes in handy never.  AC... do I care about AC?
Bards are not a "beat on me" class as far as I can tell.

Replaced whatever even crappier shoulder I was wearing when this
dropped back in my late 40s in BW.

Looted this one myself too, back in my 40s

>
> SS Bracer AC 16 clicky Shield of Flame

This used to be my secret weapon soloing; slap a DS on my charmed
pet, when charm broke I'd charm the other mob and DS it too, or in a
swarm I'd kill pet charm new one and have swarm beat it down, but the
whole swarm was taking DS damage.  Unfortunately this doesn't scale
well, when killing mobs that have 10K hp and hit for 150 on average,
the 9 point DS just doesn't do much at all to change things.  Still
handy with a MA, with this and bard songs I can get to 41 DS without
a potion... just need it to be someone else thats getting beat on!

> Sentry Girdle AC 10 Cha 5 Agi 8 HP 10 SM 5

More "hey, I looted that!" gear from SS.  At least this one has Cha
on it

This also dropped in SS, was hunting with a 65 paladin partner and a
named dropped this, not too shabby.

Bought em, too cheap to spring for Veliums.

> Large Acrylia Plate Greaves AC 20 AGI 4 HP 10 SF 2 D 2 C 2

Bought em... no regular size available at the time and heck, large
fits and its only a little more weight.

> SS Boots AC 21 Clicky Aria of Eagles

This effect I use a lot, the effect is a bard song, but lasts a
couple minutes instead of 18 seconds.  As a Vah Shir I get 50 safe
fall instead of bard cap at 40 safe fall, but still you can take
-serious- damage running around at bardspeed.  Lev also keeps me out
of trouble with terrain like running into some water kiting and
looking around, (slow down, mobs catch you, stun and eat you alive)

> Goranga Idol AC 8 Dex 4 Sta 3 HP 25

Got this soloing in ME before moving back to POD, not too crappy I
guess

Heh, can you say "only bard at kill?" I knew you could.  Tendonslice
seems to be a snare, but with mere bardsong duration.  It isnt
overwritten by bard snare, but -is- overwritten by and will not stick
on top of necro or ranger/druid snare.  It does come in handy as a
backup when killing a RIP mob (running in place, its what I call the
mobs that are low HP and running but snare stops them from moving)
with a good resist to bard snare, as it keeps proccing and helps fill
in the gaps when bardsnare drops.  Still, as a proc its nothing to
write home about.  Weapon is pretty nice otherwise, and I've never
gotten proc aggro with it so I use it as my primary weapon

> Troubador Mace 13/21 1hb Str 7 Dex 7 HP 30 Mana 25 SF 5 SM 5
> Brass p/s

Works as a brass instrument as well as a weapon, nice boost to a few
song lines; in a melee group I keep this in secondary slot most of
the time.

>
> SS Gauntlets AC 16 EB

There are other EB items out there, but these do the job, only
problem being they take my haste item slot.  Still, amount of melee I
do in an EB environment is quite small and I suppose I could always
get a cast EB if I really thought me being hasted would make that
much of a difference.

> Walrus Skin Drum sec percussion

This is what prompted me to make the character, we were camping BP
gems in SG and four of these dropped.  Second best drum in the game
at the time (Third?  I have no stats for Drums of the Beast other
than that they are primary weildable which would be nice) and I
thought "hey, how about a bard twink?"  At the time they went for
8kpp if you could find them, now I've seen em as low as 300pp in
bazaar.  Yet I still see bards with Nostrolo's Tambourine.  Go
figure.

Flute, combine Flute I mean.  Can't think of a song that I care about
that is affected by quality of wind instrument.  Nor can I think of a
really good one offhand.  This is storebought at character creation
and I have a bamboo one or something like that in the bank for invis
CR emergency use

>
> Orcish Lute of Singing sec string Str 3 Dex 3

Heh, drop off a mob I'd never seen before... apparantly it was
fantastic for a while but fixed before I got it.  I use it for
secondary slot lute for when I'm on instruments.

> Lute of the Jharin Apprentice pri string Cha +2

This is my pride and joy, quested it myself with no idea that it even
existed (was just doing the Vah Shir Bard quests for the fun of it
while learning the character).  Primary slot strings means I can
melee dual weilding, with this on my cursor, and twist in healsong,
swapping in lute just as it goes off, and back off again, hardly
missing even a single swing.  Using instrument on healsong almost
doubles the HP regen rate

I'm Eldrig, Phinny and Trak away from my epic... so figure a year or
more given that there's little chance my guild is going to help me
kill Phinny a dozen times to get epic for my alt; if he always
dropped the piece I could probably get epic tomorrow :)
