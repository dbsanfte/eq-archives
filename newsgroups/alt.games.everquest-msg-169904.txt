ROTATION?
as in: write your name on a list and get access in a month?

well well who likes it shall go with that. in my opinion its not even worth
considering. most people cant plan ahead that far, if u have a guild with
many casual players and/or family type players. with such a guild or
constellation you go into a zone when its not taken and you have the force
or you wont go ever.

how are spawns like shissar/golems/broken/named hate mobs handeled? or is
the rotation one full spawn cycle of those? if so, why cant someone go in
between to just farm some armor and VT? if not, grats to the persons who
know the spawn timer of the named mobs and when they were last killed! they
now can cherry pick their access times and get them all.

all in all that concept sounds very bad to me sorry. correct me if i am
wrong please.

i rather go with the rule: whoever gets to the zone/mob with sufficient raid
force first, gets it. with the possibilities of joint raids or sharing zones
always hanging in the air. communication and common sense solves many
problems :p
