Has anyone seen the Everquest Atlas for sale? If so, how is it?

I, for one, am looking forward to a book of maps and zone information
without spoilers and with a bit of background information I wouldn't
normally see. Hopefully this gives me what I want.

Let me know if you've seen it for sale or have a copy yourself!
