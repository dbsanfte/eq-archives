While many of the features are interesting, I don't care for the looks
of that compass, seems less informative than the default one and takes
up more room.

What really interests me is the lower left corner.  It looks like you
have 10 hotkeys AND access to 10 inventory slots.  At the moment
I have several of my cleric's hotkey slots dedicated to inventory
for right click; Donals Arms (220 point free heal is handy sometimes,
if annoying at others) Greaves of Forbidden Rites (105 point group
heal is handy sometimes and almost never annoying) Donals Boots
(these little toys are astonishingly powerful in an AE group, when
I"m a bit LOM I can switch to pouring out free damage with them,
at one point I got the kill on over 30 mobs in a seb AE group,
one wizard LD, everyone but the chanter OOM, but I was still
pounding out boot damage) and of course open slot for mod rod
and/or Tboots and/or Spyglass, then there are the dedicated
slots for automatically force feeding fish rolls and fuzzlecutter so
I don't eat my stat boosting food and drink.

If I'm reading your picture right, it looks I could save myself
quite a few "real" hotkey spaces!

Since you are a rogue,  I don't get to see what they are doing
with spells, and since you are solo I  don't get to see group
members, in particular pets.  I'd really like to see the group
member pet bars much easier to grab than they are in the
default UI.
