Oh c'mon.  "blahblahblah for donations" has been part of the in-game
jargon for 4 YEARS now.  And those who mean to be semi-charitable
make a point of saying "donations accepted but never required" in
recognition of that.  To still be upset over the use of language
years after it's become commonplace is ridiculous.  Most of us gave
up that fight long ago.  Do you chastize the military for referring
to combat deaths as casualties?

No he's not.  He's an EQ player advertising an in-game service for hire
in a time-honored fashion.

That attitude is years out of date, the usage is established and it's
silly to continue arguing against it after all this time.  I used to
hold the same position, but eventually you gotta move on.  Language is
a matter of common consent and it does no good to continue railing
against a usuage you don't like long after it has become "standard".

Open yes, plain yes.  But, in EQ it is no more honest than "for
donations", just more specific.
