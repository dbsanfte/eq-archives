If you can't find anything at all wrong get something like Fix-it Utilites
(unless your running XP which I think you are unless I got confused
someplace, there should be an XP version of it out I think its by a company
called Mijenix....it can fix some problems)

If you don't feel like spending more money, reformat from a boot disk and
just reinstall windows...
