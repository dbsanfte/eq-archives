    Name one method she has that she, and she alone, can do. Right, there is
none. The best option she has for mana acceleration is KEI in The Nexus, and
I'm too tightfisted for that. ;-)

    Of these, the only ones available solo (and the whole point of playing
the little people is to go solo) are Flowing Thought, assuming the Earring
of the Solstice's FT works at lower level, and a med bonus item like a Cloak
of Truth (assuming med bonus items actually work).

    You might want to re-read the bard forums. Our guild bards have all been
going after the eighth coldain prayer shawl - something about flowing
thought being changed to work with bard mana regen.

    Trading summoned items for buffs? Heh, I wish. Not many people seem to
want summoned food, drink, or bandages except for classes that can't cast
spells. And grouping is right out the window - the entire reason to play
alts, for me at least, is to get a feeling of accomplishment on days when
guild activities are frustrating. Going LFG for hours isn't "getting stuff
done".
