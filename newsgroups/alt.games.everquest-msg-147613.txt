}watch on group bars....enchanters have a lot more work.

My understanding is that you can get the durn horsehead out of your way by 
turning Horses and Elementals off in the models selection.  Haven't tested 
it myself, though.

My concern as a chanter is that that very targetting process often 
involves suddenly moving over to the left 10 feet, stopping to cast, then 
running around the mobs, stopping to cast, etc.  As I understand it, 
horses accelerate and decelerate, rather than going from not moving to 
full speed right away.  That -could- prove to be a major butt-pain giving 
all the stopping and starting I do.

Still.

I want a pony!
