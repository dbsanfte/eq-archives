Hi all,

I've just come back to EQ after a few months off.  Before I left, I
used to back up my entire EQ directory to my laptop in case of a HDD
failure.  This also allowed me to play whilst away from home.

Now that I'm playing again, I've copied all the data to my laptop but
when I run EQ, it does the file scan then starts trying to download
ALL the files again.  All the files are there (including the ones it
wants to download) and the file and directory sizes all appear
correct, I just can't get it to stop downloading.  I've run a full
file scan but to no avail.

Anyone got any ideas?

Regards,

Wayne...
