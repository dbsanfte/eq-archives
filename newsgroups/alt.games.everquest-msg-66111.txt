Yup, probably bugged.  Do the /bug thing to let them know.  Let them know
that you're already aware of how enchanters have to deal with being the
wrong size to those zoning/logging in after the spell is cast, but you're
not a tiny race (in fact, GNOMES aren't that tiny).  Yet AS a wolf you're
tiny to those zoning/logging in after you.
