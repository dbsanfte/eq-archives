Not by a long shot.  EQ is a middle age man, as far as I can see, a leader:
and an instructor to the younger generation (of games, in this case,
hopefully not gamers).  He's no longer young enough to fight in battles, but
still has alot of useful life ahead of him.

Anyways, I'd rather have an old '63 Corvette than a brand new '03 Honda
Accord.  Just becasue it's shiney and new, doesn't mean it's better.

There's no life support necessary.  EQ will eventually be eclipsed, but
until Verant starts diverting resources, EQ is still the same EQ that is
good enough now.  It's not like code degrades (it started out that bad).

And how many of those are going to survive to adulthood?

If the players decide to stick with EQ1, Verant will go back to it.
Otherwise, they go broke.
