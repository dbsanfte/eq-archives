Go for items with WIS don't worry about the rest of the stats too much...
As a Druid ya shouldn't be getting hit much, so I wouldn't worry about AC.
My 44 Druid has an AC of about 400 that's all.... don't care : )
Bear in mind that I only solo my druid in outdoor area's, and never enter
dungeons, maybe those who group up and fight inside dungeons may have
different opinions as to what stats are necessary.
Obviously the higher you go, you will start to think about other stats,
resists etc, by then ya will be able to afford what you want anyway : )
