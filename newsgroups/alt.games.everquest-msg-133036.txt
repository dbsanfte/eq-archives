OH, so in your opinion South African 2 yr olds must be more intelligent
than.  You've been stating that 2 yr olds shouldn't be told about AIDS & HIV
since they can't understand the concepts invovled.  Now you're agreeing that

South African children that makes them so much more intelligent, as they
must be to understand these concepts.
