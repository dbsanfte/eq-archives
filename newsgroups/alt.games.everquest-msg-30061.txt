Maybe it's just luck or the server I'm on, but in 35 levels of pick-up
groups I've had five or less *really* bad groups, quite a few that
weren't optimal, and just a few really *great* groups.   Sure, there
are people who are just more fun to be around, and that I'd rather
group with, but the "rare good group" seems to be a myth to me.

Maybe it's because I expect *good* groups, not *great* ones.  And
it helps that I rarely spend a lot of time in any one area doing the
same thing, so I'm gone before anyone can move from the "annoying"
to the "no res for j00!" list.   IMO, it helps that I don't feel I *have*
to stay in Highhold Keep if it's annoying just to level.   There's still
plenty of places out there, and, if I find the idiot level just a bit high
in one, I simply move on or go do something else until they move on.
