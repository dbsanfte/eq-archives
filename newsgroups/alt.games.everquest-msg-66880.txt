Just by being in the game your already a sheep:
Warriors can't cast gate
Casters can't tank
Only Druids and Wizards can port
Only rogues can make poison
No one can walk through walls
Druids can't lick their balls (even in wolf form :( )
(the list is endless of what <they think we should do>)

There are a shit load for rules that <they> have put in place that we must 
abide.  All of which are in the best interest of everyone, for the sake of game 
play.  Yes I deffend the TLC since it would raise the level of fun for the lower 
levels and not do harm in the least the upper levels (except for some spoiled 
brats that just need the newest toys when they come out).

Although many rules are a real pain in the ass, all in all I think the game is a 
hell of a lot of fun and that is why I play.  I also think that there can be 
improvements.

Unfortunately I didn't realize I was talking to a child that cannot engage in an 
adult conversation.  Oh well, go back to your camp and get that 1557 g34r and 
I'll proceed to "shove it".
