The concept is pretty straight forward.  You should make a hotkey to 
announce when you cast, and, usually, who is up next, can be in a 
seperate chat channel, group, if all grouped, but needs to be visible to 
all the clerics in the chain.  When you see that you are up next, you 
count the number of seconds, then cast, and notify that you are doing so.
