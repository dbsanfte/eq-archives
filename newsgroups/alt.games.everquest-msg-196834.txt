Please

I waited for 5 years for that game to come out, paid $60 the day it came out
only to find it was the *exact* same game as the original, only with new
graphics.  I think it lasted on my hard-drive less time than it actually
took to install it.
Sure...you can have my CD key.  I certainly won't be using.  I'll send it in
a few.

Sean...
