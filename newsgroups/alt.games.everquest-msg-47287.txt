Sorry. Luscian is right...

The doctors I am talking about are the ones who are working at metropolitan
hospitals... The ones who will not get paid anymore or less should an event
occur. They are the ones who have been hardly trained for this yet are
considered the CDC contacts for each hospital and in charge of handling
these situations. BTW, my information comes from fellow doctors speaking to
them, not me asking them. The fact is America is wide open, and we are
sorely prepared. The government plan is to quarintine and contain, not save.
