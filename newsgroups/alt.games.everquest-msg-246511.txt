um no, id rather not completely ignore a theme.... but to get a group
together for certain particular themes is more than a nuisance... its
an up hill battle on most occasions.  Personally I go where ever the
group goes....  I'm not a bitcher, and I don't mind crusing around and
seeing the world, trying new things.  
I understand your point, I hope you understand mine..
