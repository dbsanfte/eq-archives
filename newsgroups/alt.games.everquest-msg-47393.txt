I was not trolling, I was exaggerating its uselessness. It was NOT
noticeable to me on a barbarian I made BEFORE I read the change
factoid.

In otherwords, I did not make a barbarian and think "WHOAH I CAN SEE
BETTER" but instead to me it was the SAME and I was bumping into the
halas tunnel.

My 19.9999999999 meant that it was so much the SAME as far as
USEFULNESS that for all practical purposes it would be like the iksar
xp penalty did not change at all. 

I was trying to say this is not going to HELP the night blind at all
really.
