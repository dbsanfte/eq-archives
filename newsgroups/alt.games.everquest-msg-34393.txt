Depends on how brave you're feeling. If you can make it through to Runnyeye,
and get through there to the Gorge of King Xorbb, you just might be in luck.
The muddites here drop ore, which is very heavy stuff. If there are higher
levels hunting here, this is normally left to rot. At your level however,
this stuff is well worth the trip back to town when you've got a few. You'll
just need to be on your toes and us sneak/hide to keep yourself safe. This
does rely on a hunting party being there though.
