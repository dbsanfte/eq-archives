Today a close friend of mine informed me that he was quiting
everquest.
We are friends in real life, and the main reason I started was because
he was addicted, and basically his whole life revolved around the
game.

He is quiting because he really wants to get a life and for that I am
proud, but I'm just now getting back into the game.  I have taken one
char all the way to 25, and I'm sure I could probably go further, but
now it's kinda lost it's luster.

He has a few characters on Terris Thule, with over 1Mpp in the bank,
all of his chars are 50+.  He has no desire to sell, but he has
offered me his account, if I want to play a high level for a while.

Honestly I've seen most of the world thats accessible to a lvl 25
mage, and I DO really want to try out being a high level for a while,
but I'm having conflicting feelings because I most certainly wouldn't
ever buy an account because I feel that you should level honestly and
grow into your character....

So the way I look at it I have 3 choices 4 if ya count the final one.

1 Accept his account, and use his high lvl gear as twinkage for my
mage, and go to town in the bazaar and deck out my halfling warrior.

2 Refuse and carry on life as normal.

3 Accept his account and play in his honor.

4 Beg him to come back into the game...

I've already tried #4 he says he started playing when him and his wife
got divorced and was using it as an escape, he now just wants to carry
on in life, and the 18+ hours per day he tends to spend on everquest
could be used for so many other things.  So I guess thats just not
going to work.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
