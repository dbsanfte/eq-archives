ZoneAlarm caused lag and oftentimes LD whenever I used it with EQ, and
would sometimes break into fits where it wouldn't allow me to view ANY
websites.  When I finally uninstalled it, I couldn't get back online.
I had to go to a friend's house and do a search on google to find out
how to *really* uninstall it, since apparently it likes to leave some
settings behind to really fuck you over when you get rid of it.
