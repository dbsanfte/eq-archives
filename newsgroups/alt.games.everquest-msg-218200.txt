I've thought about this a little bit and I think, to make doing Hard
more attractive, would be to have the "reset" timer on all Adventures
missions be set to the Normal fail timer.  I.e., you could not get
a new Adventure until that timer had run down.  This would make
getting the hard 70ish/hr really worth more than the Normal 51 point/hr.
Since you really couldn't artificially plow up the points/hour rate by
chewing thru many many Normals.

: better if it didn't smell so strongly of McDonald's and SuperMario.

Problem is really, all the zones ever, once the "new" wears off smell
that way.  It's all part and parcel of my in-game addiction to off the
wall timesink crap like 7th Hammer, Hate's Fury trigger thing (damn
booze grrr), CT trigger event, etc.  Those things are really, IMHO,
off on the less traveled pathways of the Habitrail.
