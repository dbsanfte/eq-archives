You need amiable faction to get the hammer. The only ways to increase the
faction are
kill dragons (kinda slooooow)
Turn in Sarnak War Braids to the undead marine captain 4 at a time (also
kinda sloooow)

A bard may be able to charm him and do the turn in (you can't charm him for
someone else, he'd be indifferent, but if YOU charm him he'll be amiable to
you.)

You pop up in the belly of one of the under construction boats, forget which
one. I hear conflicting reports as to the safety of the spot you land in. I
myself am a dark elf, so I don't worry about it. There are however skeletal
workers close nearby. In theory, you could chain agro a goon, the foreman,
or cliff golem if you were real unlucky.

I think I'd gate in with mez song up and hope to mez whatever agro'd on you
while using the mask.

Ah, a friend that plays an erudite enchanter says he gets agro once in about
10 ports there... says he stuns, illusion:de, then AE mem blurs
