Every group member after the second adds an xp bonus, going up to 20%
for a full group. However, that's 20% to the total xp gained before it
is divided among members. Overall, I don't beleive the bonus increases
the amount of xp per member per kill, though you do kill faster. It
mainly makes it so that taking on more members doesn't cost each
member as much xp per kill.
