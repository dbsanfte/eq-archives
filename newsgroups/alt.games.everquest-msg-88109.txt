Well, I already knew faction is a numeric range.

Probably a better test (which I'm in the middle of now) is to make in FP, an
Enchanter mule (max out his charisma), and a Magician or Wizard mule from

can find a good cheap NEGATIVE charisma item for my Mage to make the
charisma gulf even wider, that would be better.....
