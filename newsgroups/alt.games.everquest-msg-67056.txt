Question to ask yourself is (or atleast this is what I do with all my
"alt's") just how much twinkage do you plan to do from the get go?

What I did when I created my bard was, decide which race I truly wanted to
be.  Myself, I chose the mainstream/popular choice (on my server anyway) of
Half Elf.  From there I copied the starting stats down (which are available
on the web, though this way was much faster for me before the creation of
eqdivas.com) then how many bonus points I could alot.

Once I had these figures and decided upon how much twinkage I would apply
(all Lambent with your typical CHA/DEX jewelry, etc.) I set forth with
finding out the stats of each item.

I went to eqprices.com to find out the stats (allakhazam for prices,
eqprices for stats is my personal preference) of each of the pieces, then
add and write down those stats on the same piece of paper.  Once I had an
idea of the "total" stats from taking the starting stats (minus bonus
points) and adding those onto the stats from the armor, I would fill in the
"spaces" with the bonus points where I saw fit.

I cannot tell you off hand atm what stats I found to get my CHA and DEX at
"decent" levels, though I can tell you I decided to place a few points into
STR so that I wasn't a total limpy handed bard. <grin, please no flames, was
just a joke>

Again, do what you think is right, though the above is my opinion of a more
calculated way of going about it.  Personally, ever since my VERY first
character of a Human Paladin, I cannot STAND humans for ANY class, not even
monks where the choice is (/cough VI) STILL either Humans or Iksars.
Remember that your Bard will be very blind (well, who knows after that one
patch a few months ago) though will be tougher (STR) if you choose a Human.

Also, I would suggest ensuring that your Bard is Agnostic for its Diety.
With whatever you decide, I hope you enjoy playing your new class.  I cannot
comment on how well a Bard the Vah Shir make, though, I have heard cats
"sing" in the past and it isn't ever pleasant. ;p
