You are assuming that this warrior will make no effort whatsoever to 
learn his class such as learning to manage aggo. I am saying when he 
starts grouping, how can he possibly avoid it? In this regard, his 
choice to solo a lot as a low level warrior is going to have more impact 
on this than whether or not he does it with temp on, don't you think? 
Although I will concede that perhaps if he could not have temp he'd have 
abandoned soloing already, started grouping and in so doing start 
learning to play his role in a group.

But what's the harm in his case? He's having some fun now and that's 
what we all play for. He isn't going to solo forever and he probably is 
going to learn to play his class just fine when he starts grouping, temp 
or no. As I said before, I think he'll have to.

In a general sense it seems to me that you assume everyone who likes to 
play with buffs on does not have the sense to realize that learning to 
play one's class well is important in order to have fun. In fact, you 
seem to be ignoring the idea that learning to play one's class and 
becoming good at it is one of the more fun parts of playing the game and 
that as such most people are going to gravitate towards at least 
attempting that for just that reason.

I have not played as long as you have but really, in a year I have just 
not seen this to be the enormous problem you describe with people 
everywhere who are so utterly imcompetent that the game is no fun to 
play because of them. Maybe it was before the level restrictions. But it 
does not seem to be a huge issue now. If it really was, how could I have 
played for so long and not come to same conclusion you have?

Oh, boy... I am probably going to get hammered on that question... lol.
