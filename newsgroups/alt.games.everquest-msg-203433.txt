I'd not buy from them, you pay a bit of  a premium. I like
to buy software, or things I might have to return such as hard drives,
from them but not computers/motherboards etc.

I'd go to alienware.com instead. The way I figure it is why spend 1200
on a computer today which is semi obsolete just because it is lower
cost? I'd save it and spend a bit more.

You can probably get an alienware with a geforce FX 5900 soon
at an okay price.
