    Nope, the caster mob I had did not have near-infinite mana. The mobs
used player templates, with all stats set to 75 and full spell books. You DO
have mob faction, though.

    Um, it's not always fun. I have a confession to make.... I was a Grief
Monster.

    One of the mobs I got last night was a max-level "a skeleton" in Nek
Forest. Almost as soon as I spawned some PC shouted about dragging the PC
mobs to the guards to "fix them". Being a PC mob, I took offense. Avoiding
the hostile guards, I found my way to the newbie log, where I found a level
1 PC trying to loot his one item off his body with two mobs that aren't
normally KOS on him. So I went over, smoked him quickly, then killed the two
PC mobs for good measure. Then I staked out the newbie log.

    I swear, almost all the mobs in Nek Forest were PC mobs, and a level 1
and 2 were the only PCs there. So the gankage was awful - the PCs were
pinned right beside the guards, and if they moved they got swarmed. So I did
the proper thing - I started killing all the PC mobs by attacking them and
forcing them to flee blindly right when I saw the wandering guard nearby. I
was a two-Bone Chips wrecking crew. The level one PC once tried to get me to
go away by nuking me, but I hid behind a rock to interrupt his line of
sight - and as soon as he came looking for me, splat. He was also casting
Flash of Light, which got me annoyed. Meanwhile, the level two is begging
the zone to let them level in peace.

    Finally, I had all the PC mobs cleared except for one shifty-looking
blue "a skeleton". He could /con, though, and stayed clear of me. I
carefully approached the level 2, and started trying to communicate with
emotes. As a skeleton I could do the animations, and apparently I was pretty
amusing. She didn't get what I was trying to say, as the /apology emote
isn't distinct enough. Then the level 1 tried nuking me again. The other
skeleton ran in, pulled all three guards away, and I ran up and pounded the
level 1 into paste before waving /bye and suiciding on the returning guards.

    I was griefing, but I had a conscience. Imagine what the true griefer
would be able to do with this. "Ding, level two!" would have meaning again.

    Sadly, no. I wanted to drop my bone chips for the level two necromancer,
but I wasn't allowed to do it. I did hear that mobs in Runnyeye could bank,
though. 8)

>Well, from my attempt so far, you don't get casters.

    Yup, you can. I was a Froglok Tad in Upper Guk at one point, and also a
Faerie Guard (level 9 ranger in LFay, at the Faerie ring).

    I'm going back tonight, to try and get into Cazic or Perma to explore.
This is what I got (can you tell I was having fun?):

    Feerrott Black Wolf, Upper Guk Froglok Tad, Dagnor's Cauldron Shoal
Serpent, WFP Large Rat, WC Orc Centurion and Giant Spider, Stonebrunt
Rabbit, Warslik's Woods Goblin Scout, Nek Forest Skeleton, LFay Faerie
Guard. I heard when I was in WFP that they were disabling the ability to be
Drowned Citizens because of how they were decimating the newbie population.
