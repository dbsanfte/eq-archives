Good question. But usually dungeon mobs have better loot than
their outdoor counterparts and are usually tougher. The con system
is only level dependant. It does not take into account special abilities.

Here is a good one for you. We had 3 full high level groups to take down
a guardian wurm in skyfire. The thing hit for 400-530 damage, summoned
and killed several people, took us several minutes to kill with 18 people and
do you know what it dropped? 9 gold. That's right NINE FUCKING GOLD!
Not even a full platinum piece or a spell or any item. Not even a scale to
sell. Tell me that is not stupid.

Then I go solo kill an HG in rathe mtns and get 55pp. That is just not
right. Mobs should have level appropriate loot.
