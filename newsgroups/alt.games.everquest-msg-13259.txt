Same thing happened to me while I was running over the mountains in Great
Divide only I managed to aggro Kardakor,
Stopped to trade with some and all of a sudden start getting ripped apart by
an unseen foe, who did not aggro anyone else in the area. Needless to say I
died.
Then I was offered a res but as I had the report bug screen up I missed the
message and lost out on then res :ï¿½/ oh well, in the past now, hope that
isn't still happening, one thing being bitten by the pirhana in Nek (and yes
I have had the same thing while over the bridge with DMF, funny they can't
do it if you actually stand or sit on the bridge, only while floating above
it) another to be aggro'd by a 60th level, casting mob.
