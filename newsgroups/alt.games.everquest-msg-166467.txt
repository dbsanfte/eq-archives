Tirya, thanks !!!
Here we have a correlation !   I did notice that I was a lot dryer in my
eyes after this experience than I ever was before the headaches.  I woke up
and could hardly open my eyes the first night after playing.
Also it did feel like when I looked to the left, right, up, and down I felt
strain in my eyes, not pain , just that it felt a bit like I wanted to go
back to look straight forward (the central position).
