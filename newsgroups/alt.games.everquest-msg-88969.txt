Then explain the following: I was ported into, I think, West Karana, to
the Druid ring. I sat down to med before setting out on my journey, and
shortly thereafter a freakin' bear is attacking me, while I'm sitting
there minding my own business with my back against a stone! I jumped up
and tried to back away, not taking the offensive at any point. I never
even swung once. However, as I'm trying to get away from this bear the
druids decide to help it kill me. What could a High Elf Paladin have
done to make this happen? I was bound in Freeport at the time but
luckily a couple of nice players saw what happened and one of them
rezzed me so I didn't have to make the trip all the way back there.
