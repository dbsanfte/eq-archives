I'm thinking of starting a troll/ogre based guild on Firiona Vie when it
goes live or shortly thereafter.

It will be a RP guild (funny that) where everyone is encouraged to speak
troll/ogre and help each other. Any race/alignment/religion will be allowed
IF they are compatable. (Not sure if guilds will be created with
guildmasters alig and therefore similar to grouping restrictions).

But either way, the propposed name is 'Spuggs Marauderz' and will be a
fairly loosley organized 'evil' guild.

One of the reasons for starting one so soon is because of the restrictions
on grouping/looting etc and I am sure nobody would turn down a little extra
help ;) who knows? we might get huge

So if anyone is interested reply here to bump it up and contact me on

ICQ 27531381

or email me at

Working on a web page now. Any suggestions, comments or ideas welcome.
