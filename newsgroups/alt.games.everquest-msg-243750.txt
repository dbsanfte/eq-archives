But this is just semantic bullshit.  You don't care how long he spent doing
it, you only care that you got the quantity of spider silks that you wanted.
You're trying to change the discussion here.  This isn't about whether it's
legal or legitimate or whatever.  You started out claiming that the
transaction was an appropriate measure of time spent ingame farming, and I
pointed out there's no constant function between time spent and loot
acquired, so that the transaction isn't a function of how much time one
spent ingame accumulating that wealth.

If you had been concerned about the time, and not the spider silks, the
latter example (1 silk acquired over four hours) would have been preferable
to the former (250 silks acquired over 6 minutes) because you weren't paying
him for silks, you were paying him for the time he spent collecting them,
and in the 250 over 6 minutes, you just got ripped off for 234 minutes where
he wasn't collecting silks, instead cybering Floyd or otherwise loafing
about.  In the latter example, you got four good hours of constant farming.

But from you response, you'd prefer the former, because you got more silks
that way, which proves that the amount of time he spent doing it was utterly
irrelevant to you.  It was simply the product that was important.

If you want to prove your original point, which was, and I quote

> But you can sell your time, can you not? Isn't the amount of plat merely
> a measure of the time they spent gathering it?

you have to show that either the wealth accumulation is constant per unit of
time, which it certainly isn't, (I doubt I could come up with two 4 hour
sessions my entire 5 years playing where I've made exactly the same amount
of cash) or you have to show that the actual wealth itself doesn't matter,
which is also certainly not the case.  Otherwise there is no valid "measure"
that you referred to in your initial post.
