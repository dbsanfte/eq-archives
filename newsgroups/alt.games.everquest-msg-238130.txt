Yep... Behind a firewall.  I keep AV software running when I am not using
memory intensive programs because of the possibilities when surfing or just
reading email.  I did get a worm from a PIF file, once.  I was expecting a
new electronic card from a friend and, when it arrived, I opened it without
thinking.  Sure enough, I got hit.  But the only reason I knew immediately
was that my AV software showed email goiung out and my email program was
down.  I may not like the additional overhead, but I am happy to keep it
running when not a major impact on my system.  I will never run without a
firewall, even though I am behind a router, also.  Not worth the anxiety.
