    You still need the minis. As long as you require something previous in a
chain of flags, you are considered "unflagged".

    I've seen a lot of oddness with flags when you have later flags but are
missing prior flags. The Seer isn't set up well to describe things like
that.

    And to help clear the confusion about Sol Ro's chamber: when trying to
bring in unflagged people, we have found that typically having one unflagged
person try to enter a flagged zone and fail will "bug" the raid and not
allow any unflagged people to enter. This is regardless of whether the raid
could allow more unflaggeds to enter or not. When everyone is clicking to go
up to Solusek Ro's chamber, it was very likely that unflagged people tried
to click up before there were enough flagged people in the chamber. That
would bug the raid and prevent anyone unflagged from clicking up until the
raid was reformed.
