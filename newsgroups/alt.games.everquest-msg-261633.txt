Nobody mentions it because its generally agreed that it would never work
with the current EQ system.

Which is not to say it couldn't work in any game... just that the game has
to be designed to accomodate it.  Gear upgrades in EQ are too few and far
between to have any kind of decay.  Nobody would put up with a game where it
takes four months of questing to get an epic weapon that wears out two weeks
later.
