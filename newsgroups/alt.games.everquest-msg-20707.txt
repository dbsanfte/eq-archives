nah . other player imput is FAR more important . I dont expect to know all
the assholes but I do expect a query on guildchat to reveal anyone I ask
about .

A guild is essential for doing any of the harder encounters in a reasonable
amount of time with a reasonable degree of sucess . All of the best toys
come from such encounters . If you dont have a guild after 55 I pretty much
will completely ignore you no matter what you want of me . The less than
desirable guilds also garner you a reputation which will also get you looked
upon with grave suspicion.

Gms are completely clueless . Warning for exploits would mean nothing to me
on someones record  . Warnings for bad language, stupid names , and certain
other items might be relevant though . Just on my server I know people who
have been warned for coh pulling , using harmony to dispens with adds during
velious quests and for slowing trakanon (since your not supposed to
supposedly)
