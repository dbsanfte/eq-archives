I'd hate that, I mean, not just dislike, but actively hate it.  There's alot
that goes into a name, it's more than just a label.  It would be like having
the hospital pick your child's name out of a baby book at random.  I'm
pretty sure that, if SoE took away my characters' names, I'd tell them to
stuff it and their game.
