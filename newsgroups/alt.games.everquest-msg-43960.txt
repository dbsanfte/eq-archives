Greetings to all in the group.

This is my first post here.  I have been reading a small sampling of the
posts here.  The reason that I am doing this is that I am considering
purchasing and joining the EverQuest community.  I would like your feedback
on the overall community and playability of the system.

A couple of years ago, I was on UO, and found my major problem was in dieing
at the hand of other players.  This was before they split into a PvP and
non-Pvp worlds.  Unfortunatly, I was on the PvP world, and the only way to
get to the other was through a special stone that could be found on "some"
encountered creatures.  I would have had to do that with each of my
characters, and some were not that strong in the adventure catagories.  How
is EQ set-up for Pvp vs non-PvP?  I have read that the system is set to
toggle whether you wish to participate in PvP.  True or False?

The other problem that I had with UO was that the players were not open to
newcomers.  I did not know anyone in RL that was playing, so I was not able
to "hook-up" with people that I immediatly trusted to go adventuring.
Eventually, I did start to find information about in-game, player run,
quests and communities.  I tried to develop som commoradery by participating
in these, but just ended up getting myself killed and looted, losing some
great stuff.  In general, how receptive are EQ members at accepting new
players?  Where are some good places to meet other players to forge
alliances and develop adventuring parties?

I look forward to hearing your thoughts.  I am not looking for the "UO sucks
and this is why" type of posts, nor am I looking for "EQ Sucks, don't waste
your money" posts unless you can be specific as to what the waste was in
your case.  I want to make the most informed decision as possible.  I
realize it will still be a blind purchase, but some guidance is better than
none.
