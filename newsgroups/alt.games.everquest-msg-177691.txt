There are more players than ever and probably going to add more new servers.

As the game expands with more and more zones pickup group spots change quite
a bit.
I like dungeons with my rogue or soloing with my druid mainly so have never
really done the oasis/overthere/dl/ thing

I think well hope the new lfg window will help quite a bit. Most dungeons
have gone byog and hard to get organized.
