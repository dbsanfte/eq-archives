There are rules on pet tanking (if more than 4 entries on the mobs agro
list, he will IGNORE pets)

Never go with a pet tank. I prefer the fight to be under our control, not
relying on luck, a charm break or whatever.

They are all a pain in the ass to slow.  Id guess 1 in 3 fights I might land
a slow on the mob (not sure if disease slow will land in the water tower?
never really crossed my mind to try..)

Having a hasted pet fighting the mob seems to boost the tanks agro a lot
though, with a charmed mob fighting, I can chain cast slow from pretty much
engage time, and in (a LOT) of BoT tower farms.. shaman and enc have never
been summoned, ever

There is a big difference in the difficulty of the other tower named, and in
the case of earth tower... just getting to the named. F skygers!
