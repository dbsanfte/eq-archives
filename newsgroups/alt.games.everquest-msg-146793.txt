Aye.  There is (or was, at anyrate) a spot near a small orc camp in
LFay that any orc would always warp from if you let him reach it when
he ran.  Dunno if that particular spot's much of an issue anymore,
don't see too many lowbies in LFay who live long enough to see an Orc,
let alone fight them, should they venture that deep into the woods
as they are today.
