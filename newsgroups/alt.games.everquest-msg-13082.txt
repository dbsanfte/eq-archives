We can only pray that this will not happen.

It doesn't.

Among other things, it does.

The people who most typically do that kind of thing are unimaginably stupid
(Like well...Red Celt), and see 3 letters vs 6 letters so they think it is
shorter.

In my experience, these are invariably the most vile, immature, racist
scumbags in any online enviornment.

I do, and since I'm the one giving the buffs, I'll put whatever conditions
on it that I see fit. Don't like my conditions? Take a hike.


>I think it is just that we do not like the way some people speak.

You are right. When I hear the word "ask" being pronounced "axed", I
cringe. It makes the person doing it look stupid. So does using PLZ. I
don't deal with stupid people if I can avoid it.
