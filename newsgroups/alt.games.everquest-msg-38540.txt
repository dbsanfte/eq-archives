places to solo as a warrior would be oasis.  although there is definitely
things that can easily kill you there.  but soloing is feasiable.
Crush-bone came to mind that fits even closer to what your looking for.  you
can be bound at entrance to crush-bone, you are one zone away from banking
and what not in kelethin, and your going to be pretty safe in crush-bone
itself.  Not sure how feasible actually hunting there for exp would be
though.  Only place you would earn exp is Crushbone castle, and I think the
Emperor Crush and the dark-elf there would still be too tough for you solo.
