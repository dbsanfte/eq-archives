We finally got all of the members of our little hunting circle hooked up
with Howling Stones keys today. I've been waiting forever. And equally
proudly, I led them marching down into the scorpion pits of OT to the
temples to go test the waters and prove our mettle.

I checked all three temples and couldn't find the fucking tomato.

We left in utter shame to go research. I may have to change my name and
move. Can somebody help out the newbie? How do I get to the entry?

:-(
