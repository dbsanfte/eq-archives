    Just did him again recently. If someone had Sol Ro but not all trials,
he was locked out of the room when the raid got bugged.

    We tested it on Solusek Ro this weekend, and that's exactly how it went.
Bunch of people clicked up, all the people without all trials got locked
out. We reformed the raid, had more than enough in the chamber to support
the unflagged outside it, and the unflagged could click up without a hitch.
I've also noticed that AoE X-Loc seems to bug a raid a lot, although my
personal theory is some unflagged moron runs to the next target zone and
clicks on it before all the flagged people are there.
