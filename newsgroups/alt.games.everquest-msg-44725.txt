It's a great idea to have more than one partition for the simple reason that
sometimes you want to reformat C: and lord KNOWS you don't want to reinstall
EQ!!

Buy Partition Magic and create at least 2 partitions (C & D).  Make sure
that D has at least 2 GB but preferably more.

Copy your EQ folder onto your D: (EQ is self-contained...simply moving that
folder is 100% safe) then update your shortcut to point to the new location.

If you feel you must reformat your C: make sure that you have a bootable
floppy disk with CD support.  If you have a new computer (in the last year
or so) this may not be necessary as you can probably boot from CD-ROM
(you'll probably have to make a change in system BIOS, aka CMOS so it will
look at the CD-ROM before anything else when trying to find a boot device).

If you go the floppy route and have successfully booted to floppy, double
check to make sure that you can access your CD-ROM drive (put a CD in, wait
15 seconds, then type E: if that is your CD-ROM drive letter, then do
DIR<enter>.  If a directory comes up, you're fine).

Then you can format c: /s (/s makes C: bootable).

The smartest long-term thing to do is copy your E: (CD-ROM?)\Win98 folder
onto your newly formatted C:.

C:\>MD WIN98
cd win98
e:
cd\win98
copy *.* c:

This will copy all files from e:\win98 to c:\win98

Next, type:
c:\win98\setup

This will install Win98 faster than if you were to do it off the CD-ROM.  An
added bonus is that any time you change something in your computer it'll
know it can find the files locally instead of constantly bugging you to put
the CD-ROM in.
