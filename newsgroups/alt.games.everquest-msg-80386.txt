Oh, good, another one.  I was afraid that poor ol' Lee was gonna be stuck
out here all by himself, scratching his pimply ass and peering through them
coke-bottle lenses trying to figure out how he wound up in the girls'
locker room with his pants around his ankles.  Not that this is an unusual
position for him, mind, but it's even funnier to duct-tape at least a
couple of you putzes together first.

Anyhow, howdy, Matt, ya' li'l wanker.  How's tricks?  So, are you also a
cross-posting asshole, or just another chess geek who hasn't figured out
how to use that big, bad, complicated software to trim a header?  I'm
guessing the latter, since you've probably got your mind honed to such a
fine edge that the capability to perform ordinary tasks has completely
slipped out of your grasp, am I right?  Ah, well, such is the price you pay
to be able to think at such rarified levels.  Try to remember it's a gift,
and all them folks laughing behind your back are just jealous.

>"Profanity is the strongest way to express the weakest mind."

What, not even an attribution?  If you can't think on your own, at least
give credit to whoever's doing it for you.  Some examples:

"Sticks and stones....etc."
     - Old Child's Rhyme -

"If it smells good, eat it."
    - T-Shirt Slogan Seen In Seattle, 1998 -

"One Is The Loneliest Number"
    - Three Dog Night, ca. 1973 -

"People Who Support Their Positions With Bumper Sticker Quotes Are Fucking
Morons"
    - Me, About 5 Minutes Ago -

><Hmph.>

So, what's that?  Your disapproving, gray-tweed, old-maid librarian sound?
Good God, man, could you BE any more pitiful?

>Having read your oh-so-intimidating diatribe, Tough Guy, this little quote

Not sure how.  I didn't even call him a brain damaged anal wart, which he
clearly is, because I didn't want to cause offense.  So, what's your beef,
sweetie?

>Regards,

Ah, so we're buddies after all, then?  Good.  A riddle for my new friend:
What do members of usenet use to scrape the horseshit off their shoes
before they enter a respectable newgroup?
