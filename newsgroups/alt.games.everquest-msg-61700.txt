For whatever it's worth, Kingston sells memory for the E-Pro 6867 one stick
at a time (the one with the 800 in the part number). For about the same price. 
But Kingston is always overpriced in my experience. 
It probably takes standard 800 ECC RIMMs, but...
In my experience (at work) upright Intellistations are pretty standard, 
and reliable, and the only IBM PCs that I'd personally own (I assemble my 
home PCs). Have no experience with the E-Pro though, and it's a desktop, not
upright, so probably more integrated.
