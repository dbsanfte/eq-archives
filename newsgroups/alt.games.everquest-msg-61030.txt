  Right, but then you're giving up a great deal of what Luclin has to offer.
You can't enter any Luclin zones unless you meet the minimum requirements...
this is what GM Calyssa (sp?) told us in chat today.  All of the new models
are pretty much a necessity for any Luclin zone.  The only reason you'd have
to buy the expansion if you don't have enough memory would be for the level
51+ skills and the ability to play a non-Vah Shir beastlord and the ability
to view a "few" of the new models in the old world (which to me would seem
to create a pretty weird look, like animated characters in a live action
movie).

  Right, but maybe they made the models a little too complicated, or added
just a few too many, given the unprecedented system requirements?  Maybe
it'll be worth it, we'll see.  Playing Luclin on this computer would require
me to make an investment of about $150, plus the time and energy I'd have to
spend doing those upgrades, and I'd then only barely meet the requirements,
so I'm not going to bother until I build my new computer.  I'll determine
then whether or not it was actually worth it... things are going to have to
look pretty damned stunning and varied for me to really feel as if the
requirements are justified and it isn't just a case of inefficient
programming or overzealous addition of extraneous content... and even if
things do look stunning and varied, don't expect me to appreciate it much if
my fairly high end system won't be able to run it with smooth frame rates.
