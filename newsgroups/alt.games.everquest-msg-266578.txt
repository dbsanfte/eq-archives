you can take all your stuff out of the apartment you currently have, then 
give up the apartment, then get a new one in your new home town.  There are 
no homeless toons in EQ2.  Everyone has to declare for whichever town.  
Keep in mind that changing alignment can only be done once and can only be 
done before a certain level (not sure but I think it's 18).  Also, I've 
been told that changing alignment affects what class you can be at level 
20, I never checked that because I had no desire to betray my home town of 
Qeynos.
