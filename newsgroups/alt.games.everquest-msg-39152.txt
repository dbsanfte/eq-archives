Oh, nm read the next sentence ;)

They won't allow char transfers beyond the way they work now, bet on
it. So they probably will make it a newb server since most euros won't
want to go level 55 or something and naked. But who knows?

But is anyone else saying, "what the sam hell is the point now???" I
kind of am. Its pretty dang late it seems to me. The ONLY reason I can
think why they'd do this as EQ nears the semi end of its lifecycle
(course UO is still around...) is SWG, it would behoove them to
already have euro servers in place and working and such when SWG and
other verant games go up (planetside, etc)
