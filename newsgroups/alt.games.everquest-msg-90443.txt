I have an ATI Radeon DDR (64 MB) video card and it works wonderfully
for playing EQ, but I'm having a couple problems in game and could use
some help.

When I'm swimming underwater I can't see very far.  What I see is a
solid black wall about 15-20 feet in front of me.  As I move forward
it moves forward.  I've experienced the same thing in Hate on the
second floor.

I've played with all my in game settings and resolutions and the
problem still exists.  I suspect my driver might be the culprit, but
am not sure.  My driver version is:  7.60.02-010914m-1428c-ATI.

Has anyone else experienced this problem?  If anyone else is using
this same video card, would you please reply and let me know what
driver version you are using and what the results are please?  I'd
really love to get this problem solved.  = )

Thank you.
