The very first part of starting the enchanter epic requires decent ( not sure 
how decent ) faction with the Bloodsabres.  Everything I had read told me to 
find Guard Shilster in North Karana and hand him 5gp over and over to raise 
Bloodsabres, trash some Qeynos factions, and get some brew in return.

I did 100 hand-ins to him yesterday, and with Illusion: Human and collaboration 
the Bloodsabres were still scowling and ready to eat my balls.

So... I decide to go farm some frog blood when a friend says he's in 
Blackburrow and just killed Scout Malityn, who gave some factions hits that I 
may be interested in.  Illia's says the hits against Qeynos are HUGE.  I 
decided to test if the hits FOR the Bloodsabres were huge, too.

I killed the guy 2 times and went from Ally to Scowling.  He's on a 6-minute 
timer ( is level 10 and drops about 5pp ) so I killed him about 10 times total.

The Bloodsabres are now Ally, and of course everyone in Qeynos hates me, but I 
pretty much hate everyone in Qeynos so it's good to have my feelings 
reciprocated now and then.  I got my empty vial and am quite the happy 
"camper" as I will be waiting for the Ghoul Scribe to pop in LGuk.

If the positive hits on this guy were as good as the negative ones, I probably 
could have just killed him twice.

Thanks for the fun in WW and the help with The Tangrin, TH.
