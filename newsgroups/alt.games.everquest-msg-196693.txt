As of right now, prolly 1.5k in the bank...haven't spent enough time
trading as I ought... :(

Was thinking of giving up most of my STR gear for Dex gear as I heard
DEX affects bow hit/miss and damage. Do you know if this is correct?

Yeah, with higer level shammy buffs (that take my STR to 235 or
better) I will hit for a max of 115 or so..usually quadding for an
average of 60-70 dmg.

Haven't been to LoY zones except twice, once to  Gunthak and once to
Dulak. Both was with guild groups, as I thought LoY was still a bit
over my head...

Planning to start the IFS quest this week, but again kinda nervous
about the WL bits :)

How big of a guild do we need for Lodizal da turtle or Kael Arena?
Never been to the Arena or Kael for that matter. I've seldomly strayed
from Antonica, Faydark and a bit of Kunark now...tried IC and had a
blast with the kitties, but sometimes I got adds :) LOTS of adds

Have bveen thinking of upgrading the bow, but the delay is working for
what I need...it allows me to fire off shots faster to improve my
skill. See, I didn't realize just HOW important archery was to my
ranger (stupid, I know) and so I didn't start my achery skill till
like 30. I think its at 169 or so now, is that good enough to swap
bows or should I keep it till I hit my level cap in archery? 

Thanks for the advice :) And I look forward to your response :)
