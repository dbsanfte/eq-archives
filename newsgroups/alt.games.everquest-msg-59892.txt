Well, not the same mob. . .  8)

But mezzing 5 orcs, Tashing and DoTing the 6th, and then going from there
seems to work pretty well.  8)

*wonders where that voice is coming from*

Enfeeblement is kind of useful because it drops AC as well as Strength.  I
don't use it often, but if I'm in a group with someone who's handling the
damage spells, I'm on mezz, buff, and "mob adjustment" duty.  Ebbing
Strength (and the "straight Strength debuff" line) aren't quite as useful.
Disempower, OTOH, Decreases Strength (by 14 - 15), Stamina (by 10 - 20), AND
AC (by 7 - 9).  I'd never waste time with it solo, but in a group, it can
make things go a bit more smoothly.

FYI, at 16th, this is the way I usually do things because it works for me
(and my groups -- we've got a fairly low death ratio!).  Advice is welcome,
because many people have better ideas than I do.  Let me preface this with
the (obvious) statement that I am not a Wizzy, and I am not a tank.  I carry
no weapon -- melee is done for me by an animation or a hapless bystander.
8)

Solo:
HP/Armor buff on myself.  While I don't carry a weapon, it can keep me
alive.
Pet is up (Shaelee's Animation), generally with an AC buff and Strength
buff, but not always.

Memmed: Tashan, Choke, either Chaotic Feedback or Sanity Warp (depending on
whether I'm using Breeze or if some kind soul has given me Clarity), Root,
Shaelee's Animation (they die, ok?), Mesmerize, Color Flux, and Gate.

Generally I use Tash to pull a monster, let it hit, and back off.  DoT and
Root.  Zap, zap with Chaotic/Sanity.  Recast my animation and/or Root if
required.  Mez adds.  I also use mez on anything that manages to break root,
kill my pet, and start hitting me, because it lasts longer than Color Flux
(though I've needed to use Color Flux to stop the hitting, run, Mez one, and
so forth).  Pretty straightforward.

Group:
HP/Armor on myself.
Pet is up.
Mist on group, Quickness as needed (and I think that's been argued), Rune on
the tanks if I've got the Cat's Eye laying around.

Memmed if group is short on casters: Tashan, Choke, Sanity Warp, Languid
Pace and/or Disempower, Shaelee's Animation (again, they die, but they save
my bacon if something creeps up on my during a battle), Mesmerize, Color
Flux, and Gate.

Generally, I Tash the pulled monster (for my own convenience), Mez any of
it's friends that want to come along, and then I either slow it down, ruin
its melee, or DoT and zap as the situation merits.

If the group has other casters, I'll tend to emphasise adjusting the
monster, adjusting my mem list accordingly.
