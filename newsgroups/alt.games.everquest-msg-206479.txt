I play in Lower Guk with my 39 Pally solo ATM, with your new HP buffs and
heal spells you should do pretty well there. As you start to get more
confident explore deeper but start the dead end where there will be loads of
Froglok Ghoul Knights dark blue and formidable to you. With Instrument of
Nife and your Ghoulbane you will clear up and the loot is pretty good also.
