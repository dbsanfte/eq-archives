Its hard to say the "best" classes for raids, because I think best members
are situational.... e.g a bard has no real effect versus Vindi, a shaman is
just a buff whore against Vindi.. against Statue you need a shaman to slow
him, which requires a bard to occulate.

in ToV/places with a lot of AE, druids and paladins become very more useful
with their healing/group healing spells

in many raids chanters are just buff whores, so what more would you need
then a single epic chanter with ae kodiaks?  in other raids they are
*crucial* for crowd control

Druids and rangers can be very useful in the 10th ring war in GD, when you
have a huge huge wave inc, they can kite mobs around while reinforcements
arrive... but against, say, VS.. a druid is a healer and not much more

Some raids can't happen without a mage to CoH.. and some raids are saved by
a necro FDing and rezzing..

Generic raid uses, imo -
cleric
warrior
shaman
monk
wizard
rogue
chanter
bard
ranger
paladin
sk
druid
mage/necro

-m
brother grandmaster
prexus
