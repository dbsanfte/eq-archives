It isnt worth it to YOU.  That is the key.  But it is worth it for you
to run to the same area and GIVE it away.

I understand this, and I have made a fortune from people like you.
Nothing wrong with loathing EC or Gfay.  Some of us love the buying
and selling and others dont.

The point in the post was that simply because an item is mundane to
you does not mean that Verants reason for putting it in the game was
for you to twink newbies with it LOL, but that there are other uses
for the item, which CAN include selling said items to low levels
rather than just giving them to them or selling them to the merchants.
