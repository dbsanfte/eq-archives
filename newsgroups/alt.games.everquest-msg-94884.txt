Yup!

South Ro is especially good scavenging for tailors - you can collect a
lot of silk with no trouble at all, free. The people killing the stuff
are trying to trigger the AC, and don't give a hoot for the loot.

You're right, you can sometimes rack up some good cash that way. I did
that gig one night, running the errands for a few groups. I did cash
conversions, sold their loot for them, and bought them supplies (food,
drink, arrows, etc). I made a decent chunk of money, especially for my
level at the time, and it was a good change from the usual gaming
routine.

My druid still keeps foraged grubs :)
