You see, that's fine, that's not what I'm complaining about. What I'm
complaining about is when I'm off hunting solo and, usually in the
middle of a fight, BOOM! Group invite. This isn't confined to EQ or
newbie levels. I had it happen a lot in the level 40-50 zones in CoH.
In fact, I had it more often there than in the newbie zones,
surprisingly enough.
