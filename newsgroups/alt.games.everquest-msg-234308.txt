Aggro management is life or death for a solo. They know how to pull, slow,
harmony, charm, slow, mez, fear, what have you, pathing, as well as anyone
in the game.

For instance, a solo enchanter would know how to charm/mez/handle adds if
they actually know how to solo. They would certainly know enough to cast
some form of Breeze on the other casters.

Same story for magicians. I mean they have spent X levels casting damage
shields on their pet and surgically pulling. They don't suddenly forget to
damage shield the tank just because they are in a group. Likewise they have
learned not to draw aggro to themselves with their burns. They may make
other mistakes like chosing the wrong pet for a group in a particular area,
but that is minor problem. I usually just ask before I summon anyway.

Even if you quad kite, getting another add means you will have to zone.

True, but I find most of the areas that are suitible for soloing to be
relatively deserted unless they are a farming area. Hard to get a hill giant
or frost giant what with all the farming going on.

This assumes you are using the wizard as the puller. I can only recall using
a wizard as a puller in *very* low level groups<under 20> where I was
grouped with other rooters like clerics or chanters. This is about high
level levels who suck. If a high level group uses a wizard to pull and the
wiz pulls 4 mobs, they suck as a group. I would disband as soon as I heard
the wiz say "I'll pull!"
