Stuns bounce on many mobs--infact all three of the Velious big three
mob "types" are immune to stuns completely.  I don't mean, well with
Tash, I can get it to stick.  I mean 100% immune.

Stuns generate high aggro and the one thing you'll learn as you level
up is that aggro management, beyond ANYTHING else in the game is
absolutely positively something you MUST understand and control or you
WILL be doing a lot of naked corpse runs.

So before you claim someone is doing it "wrong", learn the game past
the mid level stage.

>...LGuk is an excellent example;

LGuk doesn't need a cleric.
My level 44 warrior twinkie in a sub-optimal group just broke and held
the king room in LGuk and was pulling everything from the king to the
EE.  

In otherwords, you can have "fun" in LGuk because a screw up by the
cleric here isn't likely to get everyone killed--especially since a
cleric isn't even needed.
