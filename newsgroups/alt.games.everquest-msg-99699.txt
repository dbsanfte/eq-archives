  I don't know if anyone else has run across this yet, but apparently the 
Belt of the River has had its race field set to "NONE"--making it so no 
one can equip it. 
   I petitioned about it, and was told that it should be fixed in the 
next patch. Nothing major--just wanted to get the word out.

"I'm sorry, did I offend you just now? Pardon me--I'm
sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Really, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to offend you. Should I like, change my 
attitude? Should I change my whole way of  being? Huh? 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. BITE ME HARD!"
