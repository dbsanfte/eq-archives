AFAIK no video card uses Umbra, it is strictly a software implementation.
The one that may or may not be on a card is TnL.  So the question should not
be changed to anything whatsoever to do with whether or not a card has
Umbra.  It should be mentioned as a possible way to raise your framerate,
that does not work for all people.
