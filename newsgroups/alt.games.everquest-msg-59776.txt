OK, it is much more complicated that I was thinking.  Hadn't
considered the idea of having a computerized system with log parsers
and everything.  I really think I just had a 'you know you play too
much EQ moment' when I was thinking it was a bit too OOC to be much
fun.  :)

Yep, if you only have truly honorable and giving folks in your guild,
it is easy.  If only we weren't all so damn human.  Oh well, at least
you know the Paladins won't whine.  :)

How big did you have to get before loot awarding led to problems?  I'm
noticing that it seems like more and more recruits have loot issues.
Luckily we're not afraid to boot a recruit on the first day of a
trial, so we've been pretty lucky so far.  We are doing a mass-trial
of a smaller guild and we are already seeing that not everyone is as
sharing as we are.  I think about 2/3 of them are just in awe of how
well we distribute stuff, and 1/3 are greedy and/or unhappy.  I don't
know the personal connections but I suspect that 1/3 would be unhappy
in any situation.

OK, sounds about right.  Does anyone have a guild auction person?  I
hate just destroying stuff, and know that guilds need a certain amount
of PP just for coffins and jewelry supplies and hate stones and such;
I would love to just dump all the silly loot on a person who would sit
in EC and sell, but I don't think they really exist, at least not in
our guild.

Yeah, but isn't EQ also a social experience?  I don't know, maybe it's
just me, but I really like seeing other people get upgrades,
especially knowing that my turn comes often enough.  I think not being
the uberest of the uber helps a lot.  Not a lot of reason to fight
over stuff that is junk to three other guilds on the server.  :)
