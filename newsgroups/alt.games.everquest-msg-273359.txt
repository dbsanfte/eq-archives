Yes I was in a small family guild. Kinda sad when it comes to an end.
These were folks I spent three years playing with. Kinda reminded me
of graduating from highschool where all my friends went their separate
ways to college and military. When you think about it; you kinda get
both sad and nostalgic when you remember back. 

The sadder part is that what replaces it never seems as good as the
original play. Mind you it's fun; but a different kinda fun. Maybe
time will change that...
