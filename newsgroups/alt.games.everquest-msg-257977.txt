Because we're not exceptionally good at it.  Our defining abilities come 
down to some crappy nukes (horrible resist rate, long recast time), the 
ability to stack a few more self-only atk buffs on ourselves, and use a 30 
second AA ability to boost our atk a little farther every 15 minutes, 
during which we still don't touch any of the other DPS classes.  And doing 
really well at ranged DPS once an hour.

For the most part, our melee DPS is comparable to a similarly equipped 
warrior.
