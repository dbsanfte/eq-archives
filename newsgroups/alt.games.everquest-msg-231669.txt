I don't see how it's wrong.  I can live without it or go somepleace
else that is selling it at the price I'm used to, just like people in
the bazaar can.  Some sell for higher but the OP stated that others
were available at lower prices.  So where's the wrongdoing?  I price
it at X, someone else prices it at Y.  It's available and Peter will
pay what he's willing anyway.  If he's not willing to pay X he won't
even if X is the usual price.

This is irrelevant to the topic.  The item is available and does not
have a season.

Market value is exactly that, any economics book will give you the
definition  In fact, here's Merriam-Webster:

a price at which both buyers and sellers are willing to do business 

If the seller prices it at X and the buyer is willing to pay X you
have a market value.  Simple economics.

That's a personal choice and has nothing to do with right or wrong.
