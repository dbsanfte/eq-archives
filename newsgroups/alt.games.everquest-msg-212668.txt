	That brings us back to knowing the future, which is how we got into this

	No, he needs infallibility in order to claim supreme moral authority.
This is a critical point.  A god who can be wrong has no right to sit in
judgement of others.

	See above.  This level of omniscience re-invokes the paradoxes you sought
to avoid.

	That doesn't follow either.  If god can know the future, you're right back
where you started from.  If he can't, then a similar being could use his
powers in a more creative way and trump him.  Happens all the time in comics.
:-)

	That kind of shoots down all the monotheistic religions though, eh?
