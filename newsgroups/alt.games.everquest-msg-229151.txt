That doesn't sound *quite* right, so it's good you put your disclaimer
in. :) I do not know how it was done in UO mind you, but nothing is known
about any skills at character creation, just your race, gender, and facial
customization.  At level 6 you decide whether you are a mage, priest,
fighter, scout, or artisan...at 15 you further diversify within that
archetype, adn at 30 you pick your final "class".  Skills are certainly
involved, inasumuch as you cannot actually level if you don't get your
skills up (I rather like that part...no level 50 characters with crappy
weapon/spell skills), but no one knows the details of what those skills
are yet.

As always, for anyone who is actually interested (which seems to be the
minority here), www.eqii.com is a wonderful resource.

I'm looking forward to EQ2, but given the prevailing feelings here on this
list, I'll spare you the fan-girl comments. :)
