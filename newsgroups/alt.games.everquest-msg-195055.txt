Aye, I think there was only one facial model with beard on female dwarf
before, and they may well have removed it with the new models.

On the other hand, LOTR II made a subtle reference to this old D&D
arguement in one scene, to my amusement (Gygax always claimed dwarf women
had beards) and I was always amused by EQ at least having it as an option.

With a dwarven main, I've always complained that most women in the game are
beardless, and gave undue respect to the very rare bearded dwarf woman.
Personally the look creeps me out a bit, but I claim to see it the other
way, in character.

So I thought it amusing to have my Iksar armed with innacurate knowledge of
the mammalian races so I could keep harping on this point, plus nothing
annoys a dwarf more than being called halfling!
