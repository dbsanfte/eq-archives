Regen, IIRC, was for a change made to Iksar and Troll natural regen
that impacted how the AA skill worked for them. Mental Clarity was a
pre-req for manaburn, so the refunded it for those who bought it just
as a path to manaburn. Just refunding them to everyone was easier and
more efficient than going case-by-case to refund just to those who
were affected by the changes.
