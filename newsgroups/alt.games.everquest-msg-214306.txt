I have a 40 lvl Druid Half Elf and in hind sight made a really bad decision
in race and to not use all 30 bonus points on WIS stat.

I have something like a base 80 WIS stat and its buffed to 126. I still have
some things to buy to help increase the WIS stat but had I chose a different
race and used my 30 bouns points on WIS I could have a stat of 176.

It is really restricting my mana and ablility to finsih mobs when I solo.
Anyone got any suggestions on what I should do to get my WIS to a higher
level. The only thought I had was to continue to group and level till high
50's then attempt a higher level armor quest that yields superior WIS stats
?

Please help.

Steve
