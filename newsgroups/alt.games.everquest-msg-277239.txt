Man I so have to agree with that.  SWG was sooooo close to being a great
game.  It had tremendous potential, and an incredible license to build a
game world around.  Among many smaller "failures" in their implementations,
the one that made the game "unplayable" for me was the complete and total
lack of a third dimension.  When a 9 foot tall wookie runs into a 6 inch
tall rock, the rock *must* be the loser in such a confrontation.  Not in
SWG.
