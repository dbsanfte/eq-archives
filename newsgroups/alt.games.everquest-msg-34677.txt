"For moving Characters from one account to a different account on the
same server, Characters will be moved with items and coins. In order
to process a transfer from one account to a different account, the
destination account must have access to the same expansions as the
source account. "

Hmm this is really pretty cool if you have two computers
and  want to play two at once messing around or have a friend or
spouse play one character you already have and such. AAhha I bet they
make a mint off that at 50 bucks a pop and they'd already be sort of
making money (and sales) since the person would have to get kunark and
velious for the other account also.
