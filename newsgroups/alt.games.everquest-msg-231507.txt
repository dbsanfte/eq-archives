Oh OK....I always ask who they have before the invite, and in every pickup
or guildgroup Ive joined have had a statement before the fact. I would
expect to at least get told who was inbound simply to exercise such a
yes/no if I asked.

TO which I would say - sorry I have had a problem. Enough of a problem to
not want to associate. At that point the ultimatum is reasonable IMO. The
GL is asking you to act on his experiences and to ignore your own here.

Pleading from the GL in that circumstance might make me go for it -
especially since the guy is taking onboard my concerns but saying 'well
its Hobson;s choice'. If I stayed I'd remove the ignore and then put it
back.

Everyone knows who you are arguing about most likely as its likely the
last to join....that might come over as overly elaborate. Just a 'Sorry,
but the group mix is not one I can operate in, I am afraid I am
disbanding'. Ask the GL to explain....it was based on his choices after
all.
