The message from the GM (or whatever he is. . .  there aren't real GMs there
now, but it was a yellow system message from a Verant employee) said that they
did the level bump to test how the alignment hits while grouping were going to
work. I guess they figure that at lvl24 with no spells and no armor, you don't
have much choice but to band together for safety. /shrug

They did bump your skills to an appropriate level and you do have 125 or so
skill points to spend; the problem is you have no equipment and no spells and no
time efficient way to obtain either one.
