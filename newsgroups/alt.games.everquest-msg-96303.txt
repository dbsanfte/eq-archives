I don't see how that punishes anyone. You still have to get the same
amount of exp from 30-34 (for example), but you'll have the fun of
leveling steadily throughout that time rather than spend a large chunk
of it stuck in one place with a glacial exp bar (so to speak, I never
found those early hell levels particularly hard).
