I played AO about a year ago for about 3 months, and there is definately
more RP there.  I also played on FV for a bit, but I really like having
different characters that can "help" each other out, and the language
barrier started getting to me.  I think the reason the RP server of EQ
is so much less popular is the wierd server rules, not the RP.  I still
don't see how not being able to loot stuff you might need for a quest
because you are too high a level has anything to do with RP, and seems
counterproductive to RP IMHO.  

If it were the same as any other server only flaged RP on the list I'm
sure it would be far more popular than any of the other servers.

Well if you mean tactical options by "depth of content" then I'd agree. 
I came back to EQ from AO because frankly there's just isn't that much
tactically you can do.  All fights are pretty much the same.  In EQ you
have options galore, what zones you go to, solo or not, the classes are
extremely different.  Playing an enchanter I love, you can CC, Charm in
a group, Choose to Nuke or Slow? Charm Solo, Animation Solo (it's
possible, but hard in it's own way), untold variations on tactics, and
spells.  In AO I compare to a beurocrat.  I make my pet, buff him, charm
if I can and kill - over and over, there's verry little difference in
missions, very little I can do to vary my tactics, the classes aren't so
very different either.  The only thing that EQ does that I really hate
that keeps me quitting every other week is the ammount of downtime. 
Wether it's in a group that's so good all you do is stand up and nuke
every other mob and sit down to med, or just traveling somewhere.  It
gets easily booring.  At this point I'm even bored charm soloing,
becasue I've done it so many times, it holds no interest to me to go
back to the grey (or wherever) and do the same motions over again and
again for a week just to gain a level.  

I'm still looking for that next game, and quit for a bit to play
something else every couple weeks or months... but nothing holds my
interest for long, the longest thing so far has been AO, and that was
only 3 months.  The majority of standard games I finish in a week even
with my tight schedule.  I'm waiting for the next EQ (figuratively not
literally, I don't have any hope that EQII will be better).
