Bah. My dark elf appreciates the wonders of her glowing home town. 

She is a shadow knight; guards in the north ro newbie area con dubious
to her, and she can sell to Murissa Sandwicher and to the merchants in
the EC tunnel. I haven't tried strolling into Freeport with her and
decided against doing intentional faction work there.
The necromancer guild is in the sewers. I could raise faction with the
Freeport SK guild by handing in bone chips,  beetle eyes and
spiderling silk if I had wanted to; if the necro guild doesn't get
raises from the same quest, they probably have a similar one.
If you decide to base yourself in Freeport, remember the bank is in
the paladin controlled zone - in order to be there you have to do a
truckload of stuff for the biggest goody-goodies of them all. I've
heard that Highpass faction is easier than Freeport once you get
around to killing orcs and gnolls in the area; you might want to look
into that.
To my knowledge, you can go to Oggok, Grobb and Thurgadin. Not sure
what your reception would be in most of Ak'anon; the rest of Faydwer
would need a lot of faction work.

Also, you do have piercing proficiency - otherwise you couldn't use
the dagger. Scroll down your ability list (I have met newbies before
who didn't know the list scrolled) and you'll find piercing there.
