It is 100% unequivocally impossible to merge the two games (without
destroying both of them in the process).  I hear that they are going to
merge Civilization and Age of Empires soon...

I have no clue what leads you to think that EQ2 "runs much smoother than
EQ".  That's mind boggling and completely illogical.

I can run Quake 3 at 1600x1200 resolution with everything set to high at
better than 200 fps.  I can't do that with Quake 4.  I'd laugh if someone
said that Quake 4 "runs much smoother" than Quake 3.  I wouldn't argue with
someone's opinion that Quake 4 was a better game, but that's a different
topic altogether.
