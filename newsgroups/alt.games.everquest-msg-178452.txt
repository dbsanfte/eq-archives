No , it is their job to go up in space and these are the risks they
take. Remember how routine it was back in 86' when the Challenger was
going to go up that day. Nobody was  even really watching the lift off
on TV. But after the disaster , every body would watch and wait for
which ever STS was going up that day and every ones glad once it makes
it up. But then nobody even knows when they are landing right, Almost
90% of people didn't even know that a shuttle was landing yesterday.
Adventure..Hmm, maybe to those that are looking from the outside. Even
the same astronauts say that it's boring up there but you can't beat
the view.It is work, labs ,checks, duties.
They get a paycheck with the letters NASA on it when the day is done.
I remember that NASA was starting a program called "ARMY in space"
where they wanted to train Army personnel to train doing something up
in space. But I don't think it every happened. As far as I know they
only send  Air Force and Navy personnel and NASA scientists up in
shuttles besides the usually "special guest" that they send up with
them. Anybody know if a Marine or Army officer has ever gone up?
