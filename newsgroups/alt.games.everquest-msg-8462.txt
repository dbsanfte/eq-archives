I know... I was thinking the same thing and should have said something.  The
way we always do it is, if you're camping a spawn, and someone else comes
along and wants it, you take every other spawn and share it that way.

I would never be so arrogant as to camp a spawn and expect everyone else to
just let me have it exclusively for 10 hours.  That's insane.
