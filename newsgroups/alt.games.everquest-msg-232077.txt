Quick question.  Who defines effort, and who defines value?

If I am a lvl 1 char and it takes me 30 minutes to level up enough to
go kill a black bear, and then another 15 minutes to finally loot a LQ
pelt, do I get to price mine higher than a lvl 60 that ports into
Stonebrunt Mountains and nukes the first kitty that walks by and loots
a LQ pelt?  If not, under your philosophy is a buyer obligated to buy
mine first since I put in more effort?  Is the lvl 60 to be prefered
because she has a greater experience, and therefore is obviously the
one who put in effort to get to lvl 60 and deserves to be compensated?
