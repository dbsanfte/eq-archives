Really, Jeff. Actually, Avenger has it pegged-it is my sister (who of course
is also a friend). She used to be a real Dungeons and Dragons ADDICT when we
were younger (along with our younger brother - she can drag him into EQ
after I get her hooked, lol). I got the idea that she might like this, after
reading this Newsgroup, out of curiosity, and seeing a lot of the same terms
and phrases I used to hear when they played D&D.

 I am a sysop with Fighter Ace (my good twin is...) along with an XO (pro
tem CO at the moment) of a squadron, and I have some things happening IRL
that are restricting my recreation time at the moment. I am sure my sister
will try to entice me to play. Hehehe...

Thanks for the links, I will pass all this knowledge to her as soon as I get
her the CD. :)

BTW...do they use joysticks, keyboard, or what to control here?
Thanks for all the great links. Is the art on most of these FROM the game or
just promotional pictures?

And be sure and let me know if you ever want to give Fighter Ace a try.
Email me and I can make sure I can be there to assist you.

Thanks very much for the reply!
