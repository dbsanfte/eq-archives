you can try reading all the Spells on different Websites like
eq.castersrealm.com . Basiclly any spell such as ac & hp sheilds will not
stack example Druid's Skin like Wood  will not stack with  Cleric's Daring.
DOTs are a little more confusing as a single target Disease base DOT will
stack with an AoE Disease DOT. You either do a lot of Research or trial and
error.
