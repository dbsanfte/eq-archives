No, I dislike Microsoft's business practices.  I don't like XP solely
because of it's registration scheme, so I haven't tried it, but Win2k
runs like steady as granite on any machine I've every installed it on.
Only thing that has ever given me the BSoD on Win2K is when my hard
drive was starting to go and I got lots of interesting file
corruptions.

Win2K rocks.
