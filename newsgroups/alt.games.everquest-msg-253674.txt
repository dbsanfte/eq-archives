Same can be said for 51+, instead of giving something to only 1/4th the 
population of EQ, make it so it works for everyone. It is no more simple 
than that. What can be done for one, should, and can be done for all.  I am 
not saying it is a bad thing, I just don't understand *WHY* they limit 
people in everything they do? MMORPG ... M is for massive .. too ad in the 
EQ World it means Massive nerfing, Massive Limitations, and Massive time 
sinks
