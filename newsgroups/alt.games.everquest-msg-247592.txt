You are exactly right, the behavior displayed will come back to bite *you* in
the future.

You were completely out of line and as others have pointed out a bit more
strongly, you handled this whole situation horribly.

First off, it is Crushbone and it is a very important camp for people trying to
get real xp.  Secondly, why on earth would you cause this sort of hullabaloo
over an item used for newbie armor.  If you have a toon high enough to hold
down the entire throne room, then just head to the bazaar and buy an even
better item than the one you are camping the component for.

Yes, I understand that when your little guy got there the place was empty. 
However I did not see you say that you /ooc'd for anyone to join you in
starting a TR group.  You *I believe* said you logged right out and brought in
the big guns.

As a Higher level, AS SOON AS the LEVEL APPROPRIATE people even poked their
noses in the door, YOU should have said to them something to the effect of,
"Hiya, I'm just here trying to get <name of drop> for my lower level toon, so
go ahead and knock yourselves out, but could you let me know if that item
drops?  In the meantime, can I bring my little guy to join you or would you
like me to stay here and buff/heal/help you guys while I wait for the drop?"

It is up to the higher levels in the game to set a good example.  All you did
was further the 'Anyone over the level of <whatever> is a jerk who doesn't care
about anyone but themselves.'

Sony doesn't recognize camps as you know.  In addition IF those other people
had /petition you, YOU would have been told to move on by the GM.  People who
can actually get xp out of the mobs would take priority in GM eyes.  As for
your outright, admitted KS'ing, I would say I hope your corpse rots but Sony
has even taken that away from me.

I could also not help but notice that while you have no problems posting the
names of the victims in this case, you are less up front with your own
character names.  

If you are going to be a real man and post an RnF to this group, please have
the testicular fortitude to take the heat for it.
