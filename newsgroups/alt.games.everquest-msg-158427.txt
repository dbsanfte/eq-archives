Both DA and DB do the same thing:  drop you (for the duration
of the spell) to the bottom of the hate list.  Mobs will (or
would, anyway, haven't had to use it recently) happily beat
on you anyway if the bottom of their hate list also happens to
be the top of the hate list, i.e, if you're the only player on
the hate list.

When it fades, you have the same amount of hate that you did
before casting it.  If you're lucky, someone else may have
moved to the top of the hate list during the period while the
spell is up.  If you're not, they come right back after you.
There's no mem-blur component;  the mobs just don't keep
hitting (or casting) on a player that's invulnerable unless
they're the only one on the hate list.

Fun things to do:  pull an orc in SRo to a dervish camp, then
cast DA and move out of range.   The orc and dervish will fight
each other, then you can root the one who's losing (usually the
orc) when DA wears off, kill the damaged dervish, then the orc.
Ghetto charm ;)
