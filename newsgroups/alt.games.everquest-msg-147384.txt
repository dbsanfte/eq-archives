> What rights did you lose in joining?Tell me.

Some specifics? Let's start with some minor things will we?

-right to choose a place to live.
-right to choose where to work.
-right to choose who to listen to.
-right to choose what to say.
-right to choose where to go.
-right to choose what to do.

You see, as a civilian, if I don't want to go to work today - that's my
choice. If I want to tell my boss to "get fucked", that's my choice. If I
want go to the pub and get pissed at luchtime, that also is my choice. If I
want to mouth off in this NG - again, my choice.

Of course there are repercussions for all the above actions, but none of
them involve deprivation of liberty/getting locked up/AKA "the Brigg"....
