To show that your essentially similar words were, in the end, neutral
to the debate which is fundamentally about a matter of belief.
Obviously DT couldn't see that point, and apparently you are
uninterested in it (I would be surprised to discover that you are
unaware of it, you seem to have given the matter more than a
moment's thought).


To put it as plainly as possible:

1) The assertion that "there is an absolute standard against which the
good or evil of persons or actions can be measured" is a statement of
belief in something that is not verifiable.  In that sense it is
equivalent to the assertion that "there is an omniscient and omnipotent
being that created the world as we know it".

2) The assertion that good and evil can be defined only in purely
subjective terms, which amounts to a denial of the possibility of any
absolute standard of good and evil, is equally unverifiable in the
same way that the denial of the existaence of God is unverifiable.

3) The observation that different people may use the words "good" and
"evil" in different ways is a comment on use of language and has no
bearing on the question as to the existence or non-existence of
universal concepts that may be referred to using these words.
