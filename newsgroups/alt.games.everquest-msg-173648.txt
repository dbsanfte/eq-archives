I have to agree here. Fortunately I have been able to solo about 80% of 
the time, but now I'm 53 and it seems damn near impossible for me to get 
a group. Once I do get a group, and I cast Spiritual Radiance, Deftness, 
and they see what kind of damage my pet does, I'm their hero. Itï¿½s 
definitely the most enjoyable class I have ever played, but it is really 
having its drawbacks right now.
