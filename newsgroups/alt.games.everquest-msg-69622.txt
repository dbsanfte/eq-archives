When EQ first came out, there were no planes at all. Fear then Hate were
released several months after the initial release as an optional download.
Sky was added several months after that.

There are now 5 planes:
Fear
Hate
Sky/Air
Growth
Mischief

The next plane is rumored to be the plane of Decay, with your host
Bertoxxulous the plaguebringer. That rumor has been circulating for about a
year now.
