    He's talking about the Trader limit. There can't be more than 500 people
in Trader mode at once.

    And based on his paragraph about "running" with the hint, I'd say he
sets the traders up to run into a stall wall. They don't move, but because
they seem to be "active" they aren't booted. Do I win the prize? ;-)
