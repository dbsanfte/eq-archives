For those who just want to see Statesman's comments in the above thread:

"I saw a couple of posts asking for an ETA on Respec (i.e. allowing you to
"de-select" unwanted powers and re-select new ones). I didn't post on those
threads because usually my responses get buried quickly and I wanted
everyone to know about this."

"As many already know from the Strategy guide, the respec option was
previously tied to the Terra Volta Trial. That did not make it into release;
as it is currently written in the Guide, it was only in the conceptual
stage."

"The Respec option will still be tied to this Trial - and we're working on
it. I can't give you a definite ETA on it, except to say that it will be
done in a few months and not in a year or more. The Respec as its written in
the Strategy Guide will NOT be the final version. In fact, we're already
working on the specifics. But until it's nailed down for sure, I don't want
to say anything."

"Thanks for making City of Heroes the success it is!"

[So you are saying if we out level the Terra Volta trial, then we can never
respec that character?]

"That's one change I can tell you about; the Trial will stretch over MANY
level ranges - not just the mid-twenties. I'd like to respec to be around as
an option to back out of bad choices throughout a character's development."
