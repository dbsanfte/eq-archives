Ummm, how about the kids in wheelchairs and such that Sesame Street
has always had.  It's not like anyone has an issue with those kids.
It's only because in the US HIV/AIDS began as a disease mainly in the
homosexual population (though the greatest number of new cases are
from heterosexual african-americans).  In certain other parts of the
world, most specifically South Africa, it is spread throughout the
general population.  In South Africa 10% of the population has AIDS.
That's one out of 10 people.  That means that almost EVERYONE in South
Africa has a friend or relative who is affected.  Even little kids.
