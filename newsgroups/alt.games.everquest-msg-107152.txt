When Luclin came out I chose a particular look for my character:
clean-shaven with bright red hair. Ok so this makes me look like a
leprechaun (red-headed halfling in full skyshrine with leafblower --
yes, yes I have your lucky charms, now go away) but it's very
distinctive and I like it.

Somewhere along the line, my facial features became unglued. I can
either have the hair style I want with no beard and BROWN hair, or I
can have red hair and a brown beard. If I change it to red hair and no
beard, the second I zone I experience spontaneous facial growth.

Guides have been no help. "Gosh it's working for me..." Sigh. Anyone
else having this sort of problem?
