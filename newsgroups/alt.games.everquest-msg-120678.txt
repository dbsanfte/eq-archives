Since no one else appears to want to actually answer the question:

You take any of the four big wizard spires there. Walk up to the NPC
in the white robe at the spire, target them and say,

journey to luclin

then wait until it takes you there. The four large wizard spires are
in:

1) Greater faydark (that outdoor wood elf zone) somewhere near the
zone to lesser fay.

2) North Karana, just a ways up the road from the main stone bridge
(to south karana)

3) The Dreadlands, off in that no NPC area with the druid port in
monument nearby.

4) Toxula forest, fairly close to the zone to Paineel (over on the
harder side away from Erudin city)


So look for a wizard tp to NK, Tox, Gfay, dreadlands (or a druid one
to dreadlands is fine since the wiz one is near it.) Get the thing
from the npc and just stand/sit by the npc. It ports every 15 minutes
about and then you will be in the Nexus zone in Luclin.

If you can't bind yourself, get to shadow haven nearby and go to the
lower south east corner by a pool with a mini wizard spire looking
thing. The soulbinder is that lady just north of it along the shops.
Hail her for binding instructions and she will bind you.
