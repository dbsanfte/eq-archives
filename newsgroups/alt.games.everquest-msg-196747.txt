I got caught by this same trap with my 29 Necro; checked the guards outside,
they're Dubious, so zoned in.  I didn't live to zone out.

My solution was to come back, cast Invis, wander in.  The guards don't see
through Invis.

I grabbed my corpse and hauled it down the passage.  There's a long tunnel
off to the right, with guards at both ends.  However, you can dump your
corpse half-way down, watch the guards, and loot your corpse.  An
alternative is to haul it 'way out into the middle of the square away from
everything, then loot there.  The only requirement is that you be able to
cast Invis or something similar.
