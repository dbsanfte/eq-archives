Nope, nope, nope, yes, yes.

Forewarned;I am one of those guys that reads the manual before he pushes the
start button.

Nope 1: The rule everywhere but RZ<and I am not sure about it since I
haven't played there yet> is deliberately causing experience loss in any way
including a duel or PvP is an account suspension offense. It doesn't matter
how you do it, it is bannable. That's probably to take advantage of
unforseen cheapass tactics as yet to be discovered.

Nope 2: It ain't rocket science. It is ok to kill someone, just don't take
advantage of game mechanics to add insult to injury by causing experience
loss. The guy got in trouble for causing experience loss. That he didn't
know the rule, WELL! That is precisely the guy you want to ban from the
game, FOREVER.

Nope 3: This is pretty basic stuff you know. Could you imagine someone in
the NFL not knowing lining up offsides results in a penalty? How about a
basket ball player that didn't know what double dribble is? I see to much of
this in EQ PvP. Now that I have explained the rule, would you be stupid
enough to try kiting someone with a DOT vs wearing them down with a DOT and
using a kill shot? That is what it is about. Root someone near death, put a
DOT on them and watch them die or train a monster on them, you get banned.
DOT them until they are near death and kill them with ignite or lighting or
whirling wind, fine!
