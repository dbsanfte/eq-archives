My kids are teens 15 and 16, the perfect age to begin enjoying EQ.  They
both know the rules about conduct and know that they can get their account
cancelled if they do not comply.  The issue is not whether kids should be
permitted to play.  Regardless of whether a child has his own account or
plays on his parents account there are many, many players under age 18.
Personally I prefer to play with other adults as their play style is
generally more productive.  I would not recommend EQ for a child under 12
(depending on his/her maturity level)

My point is that I would like to see some policy changes that make enjoying
EQ simpler and more affordable for families.
