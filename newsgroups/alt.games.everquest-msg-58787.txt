 A word of wisdom on using Cannibalize in a group setting....I would only use
it if your oom and need to get a quick heal off to a dying memeber. A medding
shaman at 50% health looks very inviting to any mobs wandering by with a desent
aggro range....i learnt this from experence in overthere while in a SW
group...i canniblized to about 40% health left sat to regen some health..wack
wack wack..a wandering rhino thought i was prime to be killed...and yeah i did
die



>Shamans cannibalize to get their mana back much, much faster
