So a 29 druid wasn't in zone.  That 29 druid has all the
advantages of five levels on you and is using the same
spell.  And has SoW, group ports, damage shields, etc
etc etc.  The fact you got a group above your level
doesn't imply it's logical to group with a 24 cleric over
a 29 druid;  it's not.  If both of you had 150 WIS, you'd
have 720 mana;  the druid would have 870.

Sure, clerics have an advantage during the periods in
which their heals surpass that of the other classes,
but the other classes all offer other reasons to group.
A cleric groups because of their heals:  if the heals
aren't needed, they're not.  That's simply not true
for the other priest classes.

My cleric has grouped with druids or shaman plenty of
times.  I've only grouped with other clerics in either
raid situations or clearly sub-optimal groups (other than
against undead when the cleric's non-healing ability is
actually useful.)
