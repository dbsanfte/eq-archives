Green means the mob is several levels below you and you should be able to
whoop it fairly easily...

 (Note:  apparently at higher levels this is not always true...  LOL  In
this group I've heard several people talk about dying at the claws and teeth
of green mobs.  Alas, I've not yet reached the point where this is a problem
for me.  Someday though...  hehe)

Light Blue is (in my opinion) pointless.  Apparently these mobs are tougher
than greens, but not as tough as the Dark Blue which is apparently supposed
to be a level or two below your current level.  Light Blue is supposed to
give you xp, yet many light blue mobs I've killed have not given me any xp,
just like green.  I think Verant may still have some work to do there...

Ok, Dark Blue is a level or two below you.

White (Or Black on some people's puters) means the mob is your same level.
Even fight.

Yellow means the mob is one (maybe two?) levels higher than you.

Red is three or more levels above you.

I believe this to be fairly accurate and hope it helps a bit.  I'm sure
others here can tell you exactly the level difference for each con color...

Good hunting!
