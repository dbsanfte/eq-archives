For about four levels :p Or vs undead...

With the current weapons available to warriors (2 handers), you would be
surprised how little difference there is between ranger / warrior melee (ie
swords etc, not bow...which some count as melee), if the warrior is not
tanking...they have better crits, and the same melee skills as a ranger
does.  Rangers have inate atk bonus but this is offset by the warriors
improved crit chance.

Yes rangers get eq/am3, no, its not the 'hit attack twice mob is dead uber
skill of death' that people make it out too be.

LDoN isnt suited to archery (yes rangers get nukes....not great though,
resists/fizzles probably keep the nuking ranger at around the same level as
a non nuking ranger).

Yes...druid's are pseudo dps so this isn't surprising.

> If you have a cleric who isn't called on to be healer, he'll do more DPS

Yes..for four levels (56-60, proc swoosh hammer + nukes).

Or druid...or mage...but assuming not a raid charmed pets come with a
penalty (offset by increased kill rate).

CoD'd pet in bot is the most lethal player controlled damage I have yet
seen.

> Against undead, a paladin may well outdamage a warrior.

Against undead (with SU3, he will definitley outdamage a warrior),
without...(using only undead procs), he will be close if using 2hs, but
lower weapon skills will mean it is around even / less than a warriors dps,
imo.

> Being able to outdamage shadowknights, shamans, and paladins does not
> mean you are a "DPS Class".

I never said they were a dps class, I said they didnt do as badly at dps as
some people make out.

Doubt a warrior would outdamage a shadowknight (2hs, +dot, +lifetap,
+nukes), again, SK do more damage than most people give them credit for (WoS
(waste of space) skelly does around 15fps, for example (highest SK pet))).

65 warrior full AA
65 ranger full AA

Equally equipped.

The warrior will do greater melee damage if not tanking.

Take it down a notch...

40 warrior
40 ranger

The warrior will do greater melee damage if not tanking (in fact, the ranger
is a better choice for tanking at this level, imo, his self + stackable DS
really do add to his dps).

Conclusion...warriors are not low on the dps table, the are not near the top
for sure, but give them some credit, they have crits, high atk, high weapon
skills, very good weapons 'available' to them.

Sure to make that group min/max, switch the warrior for a rogue for an extra
bit of dps, but then you lose the option of  decent offtank if needed
(warriors have no utility huh? Who else is gonna offtank that as yet
unslowed add? :p). And you would still finish the ldon in the same time or
thereabouts.

Maybe I have just been spoiled by good warriors in my guild, but there
problems are not as bad as others, and they themselves make it out to be,
*IMO*.

P.S. I compare ranger/warrior alot, as I play a ranger and fight often with
a 65 warrior, his damage parses where HIGHER than I expected them to be in
comparision to mine (ME: cf3/eq/am3 vs HIM: all defensive AA)

The shadowknight I fight with often also surprised me with his dps....the
weapons you can get now (bazaar) are damn powerful, plus all the stuff I
mentioned before.
