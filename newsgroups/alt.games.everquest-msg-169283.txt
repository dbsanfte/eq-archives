The "don't post if your under 50" was just a point - it's hard to tell what
classes are balanced and not until you get above 50.
(For example - wizards must really be up and down during their career etc)

And you must always expect to get flamed on the internet -If you remember I
said in the first post "now start flaming".

Annie (you have a beautiful name btw - at least in my swedish ears :o) ,
have you ever wondered why there is so much aggression on the internet, it's
kind of funny that many of the worst flamers don't know the reason  :o)

The reason is so obvious :

It's because it's so much easier to hide behind a computer screen, you do
not have to take the consequences of your actions, therefor it's hardly a
thing of bravery to flame but the opposite. ;o)

When you explain that to them many of them get less noisy in that discussion
or you get the expression you really touched a sore spot (is that the right
english expression?).
