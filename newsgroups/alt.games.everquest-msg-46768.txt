Wow, that -is- excedingly poor planning on their part.  What on
earth is the thought process?  They aren't getting a test of the abilities

of 24th level characters, since the characters have the skill sets and
equipment of 5th levels at best... and they aren't -going- to get their
skill sets up or equipement or spells up, since blue-to-24 mobs aren't
really killable by what are essentially HP/Mana twinked newbiesl
