Exactly.

This is from the excellent review of 14 LCD monitors at tomshardware:

" The contrast for CRTs can go as high as 700:1. The cr�me de la cr�me
among today's crop of 15" LCDs have to make do with 450:1. And models
with contrast ratios of 250:1 or even 200:1 aren't exactly rare, either. These
low contrast ratios cause darker shades to be displayed as black. Any details
that depend on these color gradations get lost in the process. Even gamers
are affected by the problem, since displays suffering from really low contrast
ratios will only be able to reproduce sequences in dull, drab colors.

If you've got a newer CRT monitor, you wouldn't dream of using a refresh
rate slower than 85 Hz. And while the maximum refresh rate of a CRT
monitor is a good yardstick for its quality, this isn't the case for a comparable
LCD monitor. In a cathode-ray tube, an electron beam scans the image onto
the panel. The faster it can scan the panel, the better the display, and,
consequently, the higher the refresh rate. Ideally, you would set your CRT
to run at 85 to 100 Hz. In an LCD monitor, the image isn't created by an
electron beam, but by pixel triads, each consisting of a red, green and blue
subpixel. The image quality depends on how rapidly these diodes can be
turned on and off again. This rapidity is known as the response time. For
the monitors we tested, the response time ran the gamut from 25 to 50 ms.
In other words, the maximum number of images displayed per second
varied between 20 and 40, depending on the model.

Although the response time is, unfortunately, not listed for many monitors,
it should be as short as possible. The current best is 25 ms. But watch out!
Some manufacturers differentiate between the come-up and come-down
times, i.e. the time required for each pixel to glow white, turn black and
then revert to white again. By this measure, a monitor with a come-up
time of 15 ms and a come-down time of 25 ms has a total response time
of 40 ms. "

Most of today's LCDs are inadequate for hardcore gaming.  If you're
putting together a high-end gaming system with a high-end CPU/video
card, it's silly to use a monitor that will limit effective performance.
