Not at all. In fact, the beta of EQ was THE MOST FUN i had in my 3
years of playing EQ. It was all new and I was an ogre warrior with an
ogre shaman buddy. We had no idea what the hell we were doing and got
in beta phase 3. That was the most fun month and a half or so(forget
exact time range) I've EVER had in any video game. Next we tried out
pvp when they were testing that and it was also a blast. Pvp then was
anyone can loot EVERYTHING on ANY dead corpse. This made it a BLAST as
newbies. You'd gank each other and see some guys dead corpse and steal
his stuff and then see him yelling about it in shout. The whole thing
cracked me up because it was a temporary beta TESTING PVP but people'd
freak out like they were married to the characters.

GOD THAT THING WAS FUN. The only other beta I've been in that was that
fun was the UO pre alpha, which is frankly STILL one of the best
mmorpgs I've ever played. They totally REAMED UO IN THE ASS from the
prealpha to the betas. The pre alpha did not have that stupid ass
exploitible prone skills by use, but rather had leveling and so many
points to add to stats. That worked out really well. It also had these
cool knight npcs you killed in colored armor and stuff, which you
could then wear. My friends and I loved it though the world was small
and all you had at that time to kill was those knights and some orcs. 

When Origin was running this prealpha and most of the 200 or so people
in it were playing nearly 24/7 for a week, that was when they said
"holy fucking shit!"(pardon my language) and KNEW that they really had
something FREAKING HUGE in the concept of an MMORPG. The prealpha was
more or less a test for origin and I think EA(don't remember if they
were involved or not) and the public reaction was what gave them the
go ahead to go nuts with the thing. Everquest was already in
development at that time, in fact it was probably started before UO
but took a lot more time being full 3d with actual talking npcs and
quests at launch.

Betas of MMORPGS are just fun as hell ;) 
I'm getting in the EQ2 and SWG ones at ALL COSTS. I even had a great
time in the Anarchy Online beta though the game kind of sucked. Its a
great chance to see what the game is like before buying and to play
for FREE. Of course they'll let in those $39.95 legends server rich
bastards first, but I'll be playing for free in the EQ2 open beta at
least. Knowing what I know about EQ2, from the site and faq, it is
going to be a FREAKING ASS FANTASTIC game. I'd not miss the beta for
the world.
