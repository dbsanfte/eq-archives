LOL, people like that never learn, had I been the warrior, I would've
offered to hold them for your alt free of charge, I like having good player
faction in case I need help in the future. (Although, call me a hypocrite,
but if you were dead-dropping a fungi tunic, I would've just laughed myself
silly and kept it, or offered to sell it back to you at 1/2x fair market
value =P), but BS like that warrior did is just stupid, did he really expect
you to bend over backwards to get stuff that most likely represents no
financial burden whatsoever?
