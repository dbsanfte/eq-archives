I don't believe that all "manuals" have recommended that new players pick
druids to play, nor do I believe that most people reading that would follow
the advice. Even if manuals did and players followed the advice, after a
while if the class was not enjoyable to play they'd switch classes.

Druids being the jack of all trades that they are is a large part of their
draw. In past games when people have been able to make "tank mages" they
have done so. Not that druids are a tank mage sort of character, they have
the attraction of multiple abilities. Having so many options makes them a
lot more fun to play for some people than a "one trick pony" kind of class
that specializes in one sort of field.
