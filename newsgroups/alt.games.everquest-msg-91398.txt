    Be sure to do it in the right order, though - sell fully charged item
first, then items you want recharged. And this works for ALL items with
charges, like the res staff off Nagafen. You just have to be willing to pay
the buyback cost on the items, which isn't always so trivial. The Mask has a
nice buyback on it, though. :-)
