	AC melee combat is *slightly* more complex, in the following
ways:

	* Asheron's Call has distinct hit locations which, for the
purposes of player vs. MOB combat, translates into "Aim high," "Aim
medium," and "Aim low."  Some AC MOBs are more vulnerable to low
shots, some are more vulnerable to head shots, etc.  (In terms of
player mechanics, there are three auto-attack buttons instead of just
one.)

	* Armor in Asheron's Call is not cumulative.  If you're not
wearing any leg armor and something hits you in the leg, it doesn't
matter how uber your chest armor might be; you're gonna take full
damage from the shot.

	* There are 7 different damage types in Asheron's Call, and
different armor pieces (and different MOBs) may be more vulnerable to
one type while being resistant to another.  Metal armor in Asheron's
Call almost always offers above average protection against bludgeon
damage, but offers no protection whatsoever against electric, fire, or
frost damage.  Armor based on animal hides usually offers better
protection against elemental damage (fire, frost, lightning, or acid),
but offers less protection against physical damage (piercing,
slashing, and bludgeoning).

	So there are *some* wrinkles that differentiate AC melee from
EQ melee.

	But when you get right down to it, they're both the same:  Run
up to the MOB and hit auto-attack.
