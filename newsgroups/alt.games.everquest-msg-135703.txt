Marvelous - thank you, and thanks to the others that have responded. 
I had resigned myself to spending a week or three doing nothing but
porting just to earn enough to get some gear, so I'm now very
relieved!

Unfortunately I had to be elsewhere this evening and I'm away for most
of the weekend (playing AD&D, as it happens :), but hopefully our
paths will cross soon - I'm sure that having a grateful druid will be
of benefit to you in the future.  :)
