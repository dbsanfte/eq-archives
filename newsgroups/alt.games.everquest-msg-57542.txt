That is an interesting idea. There could be some xp bonus for
PC's who get kills in that daily "smart zone," to incentivize
people to take their chances there. It would add an interesting
twist to the game, but also make player-mobs easily avoidable for
those not interested in a PvP-like atmosphere.

I could see significant abuse potentials, which would need to be
thought about and minimized. If that could be dealt with then you
could extend this to at least midlevel mobs if not highlevel, so
it could be more than just newbie zones.
