In reference to finding a group, because I levelled so much slower than my
friends I learned to solo with my ranger on Tunare, now my Barbie BL is a
little harder to solo with, but the lesson I learned have helped. I also
tend to find a few partners and stick with them like glue, including nights
where I am just a good friend and help them with their quests while gaining
little for myself. I find that this comes back to repay me many times over.
