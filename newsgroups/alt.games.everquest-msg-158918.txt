    I think the planes were meant to be a progression. You XP off the easy
"tier one" planes, building up gear and spells until they begin to go light
blue. Then you move on to the tier two planes.

    But players know that levels > all. As of last night I'm level 64, and
grinding away as hard as I can in the Tier 2 plane I've done almost all my
levelling in. I have one dropped level 61 spell, but I don't need the new
spells to XP. When I'm at 65 I'm going to blow through as many AA points as
I physically can, and THEN I'll go back and bottom-feed for spells and
needed gear. This is assuming the rumoured XP nerf doesn't happen on
Wednesday.

    Juggs is still blue at 65, even though the rest of Sebilis isn't (65
bard in guild saw one light blue Ilis on track, all other frogs Ilis and
lower green). The stuff in ToV is also blue. Ssra greens out, which is very
disappointing. That same bard told us Arch Lich is blue now. I can just see
our XP groups now. "Pulling - inc. Aaryonar." "Oh, cool. A named!"
