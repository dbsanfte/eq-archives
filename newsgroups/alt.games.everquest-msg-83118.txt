It can also be caused by lag or packet loss. This happened to me once in
Rathe Mtns. I was kiting a clops when another one popped on me and on screen
I was running halfway across the zone, when the clopses caught up and
pounded me. I saw exactly where my corpse in wolf form fell.

Being familiar with the area, when I got back my corpse was nowhere nearby.
I petitioned and the gm was nice and found it for me. It was about 2
minutes' run away, in an area where the clopses dont even spawn. The wolf
form was gone. I've never gone into that part of rathe and it was not in a
straight line from anywhere I had been. >shrug<

The gm basically said yeah yeah whatever, patted me on the head and said
nice player. Go play.

I had not been drinking that night. I was the designated looter. What was
going on?
