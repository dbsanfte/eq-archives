I played a bard for a little while, and I too felt as you did.  I loved it.  My
bard was unstoppable.  I loved being able to solo, and I didn't even kite much
(maybe if I got low on life).  But wait til around 20, when you try to solo
something.  You can have GREAT equiptment (I had full lambet, Iksar Berserker
Club and Sainy's Claw) and you'll get POUNDED.  Kiting at this level is out of
the question in my opinion, because I would rather get in a group than take 20
minutes to solo an even mob kiting.

Anyway, maybe you'll like it, most likely you'll find out why there aren't many
high level bards.
