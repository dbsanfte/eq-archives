The Newbie FAQ:

(It wrapped, so be a Lert)

The server Antonius Bayle is European based.
The Firiona Vie should be called the Very Difficult server, because of
the narrow rule set.
All Zeks are PvP - player vs Player- with different teams or one on one.

Otherwise, there are slight differences in temperamental flavor and
economy. For the most part, ping times should be the same.

There is no longer any way to get a player count. But you can sort by
most active.
