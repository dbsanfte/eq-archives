True, but these guys never answer, and they repost this ridiculous shit
everywhere, under numerous names. There was a real pain in the arse
troll in the UK groups some time ago who posted quite clever bits of
stuff, only he attached it to so many names, posted it so often that it
just stank everything up. He often didn't set it up properly and you
would get a big old mess reposted hundreds of times. I don't think even
the thickest troll would bother that much.
