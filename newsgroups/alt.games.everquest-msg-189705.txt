Keep her playing a variety of classes, until she finds what she likes. 
Make sure she can group in your groups, even if you have to start a new 
toon to level up to group with her.  My wife tried ranger and druid, 
then found she loves playing a wizard.  Unfortunately she has trouble 
finding a group at times, but she loves the big boom!

Also consider trade skills.  I can't stand 'em but my wife does almost 
all of them.

Oh, and one other word from the voice of experience.  Abandoning her 
level 17 ranger in some remote zone because you want to go raid 
somewhere is a big faction hit.  The family that plays together stays 
together.
