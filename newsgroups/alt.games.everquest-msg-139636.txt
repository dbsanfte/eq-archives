    Yup. And what you can't buy, you camp. As a wizard, my hypothetical
caster can get in on a manaburn or two per week on Gore, Sev, Tal, VS (the
most common burn targets). The good drops on them, like haste items, epic
pieces, or Kunark class leggings all sell for as much as the CT drops I
listed. And when you aren't on minor raids (and the level of ability of this
player's guild means they will be doing minor raids) you go to CT with
friends and camp items, which brings in even more fantastic amounts of plat
if you can't use what drops. The big Asian guild on my server has been
following this exact model, and while they're just at the Grieg level in
terms of what they can kill their membership has great gear - better than
some of my guildmates, by far.
