While I agree with the overall sentiment, it would be nice if they did 
fix all the bugs found while the changes are on the test server, prior to 
introducing them to the live servers.  It would also be nice if they did 
not choose to make last minute changes that were not tried on test first.  
The purpose of the test server is, after all, to attempt to detect, and 
correct, issues prior to introducing them to the live servers.
