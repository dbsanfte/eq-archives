OK, Here are the results:

Gnoll Hide Lariat total damage 355 (after removing the punch damage),
elapsed time, 2 minutes 57 seconds, or 177 seconds, DPS is 2.00565.

Serrated Bone Dirk total damage 181, elapsed time 45 seconds, DPS is
4.02222.

So, your log supports what I have been saying, the better ratio, slower
weapon is doing twice as much damage over time as the faster weapon.

For the record, the Gnoll Hide Lariat is 3/20, and the Serrated Bone Dirk is
8/27.  I would suggest trying it with weapons that are a lot closer in ratio
than that.

One question though, is his 1HS skill at the same level as his Piercing?
That will make a difference as well.
