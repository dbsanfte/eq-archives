Quite the patch message today!

April 12th, 2005
*** Headlines ***
------------------------------------

- A new button has been added to character select: Return Home. If a
  character has not been played in the past 6 hours, this button is enabled
  and pressing it will log the character into the game in their starting
  city.

- If a character is logged out for more than an hour, full health, mana,
  and endurance will be granted upon logging in. This is still a bit under
  development. You may not be quite at 100% but very close.

- Re-envisioning has begun!

- Over 600 Spell modifications.

- New zone art for the character select screen and character creation.
  Crossing the bridge while in Explore mode will allow you to enter the
  world. Note that all characters are in the same area now. There are no
  longer class specific areas.

- New Hot Spots!*
The Warrens
Netherbian Lair
Echo Caverns
The Scarlet Desert
The Tower of Frozen Shadow
The Hole
The Grey
Howling Stones
The Halls of Betrayal (Chardok B)

- There are 2 new keyboard shortcuts in the Command section in the Options
  menu, Open Inventory Bags and Close Inventory Bags. Setting these, then
  using them will open/close all your general inventory slot bags
  (bag1-bag8).

- Added a teleportation stone to Arena in Plane of Knowledge.*


*** Re-envisioning Specifics ***
------------------------------------

- Many modifications have been made to the cast times, recast times, mana
  costs, and damage potential of many single target direct damage
  spells. The largest changes have been in level 1-50 spells, but many 50+
  spells have been adjusted as well. These changes have caused the
  damage-per-second potential and/or the damage-per-mana values of these
  spells to be increased and should benefit the classes who use these
  spells in nearly all cases. Note that this also includes special purpose
  spells such as undead and summoned direct damage spells. Please check the
  in game descriptions for specific changes.*

- The 750 cap on mana increase spells has been removed.*

- The hard-coded level 52 NPC cap on Fear spells has been removed. We will
  be adding new fear spells in the near future which will allow players to
  fear higher level NPCs.*

- Assassin- You will now receive messages in your chat window when you are
  healed by any heal-over-time spell. This includes both short term HOT
  spells as well as long term regen spells. You will receive the message if
  the spell actually gave you health back, so will not receive messages
  when at full health. These messages can be turned off through a new
  filter in the options window.*

- Ranger, Beastlord, and Paladin heals have been upgraded. See the spell
  descriptions in game for details.*

- The AC cap and percentage return on AC over the cap for monks has been
  increased.*

- Increased the knock back effect on the Warrior AA Press the Attack.

- Theft of Thought will no longer return only partial mana from NPCs over
  level 52. In addition, the spell was changed so that it will only return
  as much mana as the NPC has if that is less than the amount that the
  spell is trying to steal. So it will steal 400 mana from an NPC that has
  1000 mana, but it will only steal 100 mana from a NPC that has 100 mana.*


*** Spells, Skills & AAs ***
------------------------------------

- Increased the effectiveness and decreased the casting time of the Ranger
  AA Auspice of the Hunter.*

- Increased the amount of damage absorbed by the Bard AA Shield of Notes.*

- Increased the damage done while using the Bard AA Dance of Blades.*

- Added a negative resistance mod to the Shaman AA Virulent Paralysis so it
  is more likely to land on NPCs now.*

- Modified the proc chance on spell Lightning Channeling and Storm
  Channeling. Both of these spells now have an increased proc chance.

- Sound of Divinity and Sound of Might will now use their own separate
  shared spell timer.

- The spell enhanced learning can no longer have its duration increased by
  Alternate advancement skills and/or focus effects.

- Flames of the Valiant and Flames of Redemption should now proc more often
  and be resisted much less often.

- Protection of the Wild should no longer be overwritten by Strength of the
  Hunter.*

- Spirit of the Panther and Spirit of the Leopard have been modified. NPCs
  were able to trigger the effects of these spells at a much higher rate
  then players. The rate of NPCs triggering these effects has been lowered
  to match PCs. Additionally, the base damage of the effect has been
  lowered, and the spell will now only land on PCs and pets that are a part
  of your group.

- Removed the focus effect limiters from Persuasive Gaze, the focus effect
  found on the enchanter epic 1.5. It now works on any detrimental spells
  up to level 70 the same way the focus effect on the enchanter epic 2.0
  does.*

- Fixed a problem with focus effects that reduce hate. It was not using the
  highest effect if more than one focus effect was worn.

- Dragon Fang and Leopard Claw will now generate less hate.


*** Items ***
------------------------------------

- Items that have a combat or clickable spell effect that was changed due
  to the spell changes in this patch have either had their proc rate
  adjusted to compensate or use a new spell to maintain their damage
  potential.

- The Anguish chest pieces now have additional worn mods and a new spell
  focus effect.

- The Anguish wrist pieces now have additional worn mods.

- Mirrored Mask will no longer conflict with other recast timer based items
  such as the Soul Orb.

- Hammer of Rancorous Thoughts is now a 39/25 weapon with a 225pt proc.

- Dragonkiller is now a 34 (+2 magic)/21 weapon.

- Mace of Grim Tidings is a 32/22 weapon.

- Broken Mandible of the Broodqueen is now a 12/18 weapon and has a +5% mod
  to backstab.

- Fang of Kessdona now has +12% mod to backstab.

- Crescent Palemoon now has the focus Aneuk Glare. It also has +15 avoid,
  +4 spell rune and +4 regen.

- Aegis of the Amber Moon now has +3 shielding, +4 dot rune, +6 regen.

- Bladewhisper Chain Gloves of Journeys now has Cleave V as the worn
  effect.

- Bladewhisper Chain Legguards of Journeys now has the focus of Alacrity of
  the Ikaav.

- Summoned: Burning Shank should proc more often.

- Eye of Yar`Lir is now called - Bracer of the Debauched now has +2 mana
  regen and +20 attack.


*** Missions, Quests & Events ***
------------------------------------

- Added the following new Dragons of Norrath missions
House of the Autumn Rose (Norrath's Keepers Only)
Plunder the Hoard (Dark Reign Only)
A Goblin's Escort
Halfling's Treasure Map
Signal Fires
Sudden Tremors
These will show up on the usual mission givers once you have enough faction.

- Modified the shards awarded for many of the Dragons of Norrath missions
  to better reflect how long they are taking to complete.

- Changed the adventure - Changes were made to all Muramite Proving Ground
  trials. The major changes are: Adaptation is slightly easier, the trial
  of Ingenuity was significantly changed, and NPC resists in all single
  group trials were lowered.

- Corrected a problem that was causing some NPCs in the Muramite Proving
  Grounds to show up in the wrong part of the zone.

- In the Citadel of Anguish it's no longer possible to fight Arch Mage
  Vangl without completing the Keldovan, Jelvan, and Hanvar events first.

- The Warden Hanvar encounter has been made more challenging; you may wish
  to bring some extra allies with you.

- Beware, if you are too close to a wall the swarm adds in the Mata Muram
  encounter will spawn directly on top of you.

- Increased the drop rate for the Tongue of the Zun


*** NPCs ***
------------------------------------

- Modified King Xorbb in Beholder. He will now drop Slime Crystal Staff
  100% of the time.

- Players can no longer attempt to give stacks of items to NPCs. The NPC
  would treat the stack as one item and you would lose the rest. There is
  now a check to help with people putting in a stack of items and losing
  them.

- Items given to an NPC by a PC will no longer count as a Task item when
  looted.

- NPC pathing code has been reviewed and some changes have been made which
  should prevent NPCs from becoming stuck and eventually becoming
  invisible. Please let us know if you see this happen any more.

- The Cube Fragments in the Gates of Discord Sewer trials will no longer
  get stuck in the geometry.

- The Soulbinder at the Firiona Vie outpost is now able to bind you to that
  area.


*** Tradeskills ***
------------------------------------

We have changed the chance to gain a skill up when using tradeskills.
Previously there was a large increase in the average number of combines
needed for a skill increase for skill values of 160 through 190. This made
sense when 200 was the skill cap. We have changed the algorithm to remove
the harsh spike in combines required for skill ups from 160 to 190, making
it a more reasonable to increase all the way up to 300. For more details
please see the post here:

http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&message.id=5800

- Alabaster Beak and Ivory Stormrider Canine are now marked as usable in
  tradeskills.

- Dragons of Norrath brewing items now drop off NPCs. They were only
  available through foraging before.

- Added the race name to the Unfired Cookie Cutters. New item names are:
  Unfired Barbarian Cookie Cutter, Unfired Gnome Cookie Cutter, Unfired
  Troll Cookie Cutter and Unfired Animal Cookie Cutter.

- Added the recipes for four cookie cutters for Luclin beasties. The
  sketches and molds should be easily found on vendors.

- Added the appropriate effects to Dragons of Norrath potions.

- The recipe for dough made from Rock Hopper Egg now uses Rockhopper
  Egg. It turns out that there were two items with similar names, but the
  one used in the recipe doesn't drop in game.

- Removed the recipe for chain jointing that was used in Planes of Power
  armor. This recipe was removed because the jointing is no longer used in
  any recipes.

- You will now only need to collect half the number of items for the level
  65+ Vah Shir racial armor pattern book quest.


*** Server stability ***
------------------------------------

- We believe we have corrected the problem with the excessive server lag
  that has been happening in most raid zones. A guild from one of our live
  servers was willing to come over to our test server and verify the raid
  in pofire was working properly without causing the zone to lag out. They
  were able to complete many of the stages of the raid successfully and
  even multiple times without issue. There was one instance of a mob
  warping after getting in a bad location, but we have made vast
  improvements from its current state. We have also improved our logging
  code to better detect similar problems should they occur again in the
  future. Please let us know if you experience any problems related to
  this.

- The memory leak problems that have recently been affecting the world
  servers has had much progress. Several memory leaks related to the
  previous update have been corrected, and server stability has improved
  measurably as a result. We will continue to monitor the servers closely
  for memory leak issues.

- A zone crash in Chardokb related to the Korucust encounter has been
  fixed.

- A zone crash related to guild tribute being toggled while a player was
  being charmed or feared has been fixed.


*** Chat filtering ***
------------------------------------

- Pet responses to commands (except for /pet leader) are no longer
  broadcast, but go only to the owner of the pet.*

- Pet responses to commands can now have a selected color and be redirected
  to any chat window.*

- Pet spell-casting messages can now have a selected color, be redirected
  to any chat window, and be filtered to not show at all.*

- Assassinate, Deadly Strike, Slay Undead, and Finishing Blow messages will
  now be displayed in the Melee Critical message color and redirect/filter
  as other crits.*


*** Mail System ***
------------------------------------

- You now have quick access to all of your character mailboxes on the
  current server from any of your characters.


*** Title Suffixes ***
------------------------------------

- The title system now supports title suffixes. The first use of this new
  feature are the server titles.


*** Guild Hall (Guilds) ***
------------------------------------

- Added a guild tribute master to the guild hall.

- The guild bank no longer accepts NORENT items.

- Fixed a bug that allowed players with out the proper flags to remove
  items from the Guild bank.

- Using any Eye of Zomm type spells in a guild hall will no longer take the
  client to server select.


*** Bazaar/Barter ***
------------------------------------

- Added and Augment pool and Augment Solvent Merchant in the Bazaar.

- Added new search criteria to the Bazaar search: min level, max level. Any
  items which match all other search criteria, yet have a rec or req level
  outside the boundaries set in the new fields will not be returned by the
  search.

- The barter UI code has been improved. There were some issues related to
  keeping the client properly synchronized with the server which have been
  fixed. It now more accurately tracks changes in inventory when multiple
  players are interacting with a buyer. Also, if a buyer has a LORE item,
  any buy-lines that require the LORE item will now automatically disable
  because the buyer would not be able to complete the transaction (because
  it would result in two lore items on the buyer). Previously this was
  causing a client-server sync issue that would result in a player being
  disconnected.

- Barter Search Window: Right-clicking on the item sought by Buyers found
  in a search will display that item. You now have to right click on the
  Buyer's name to get the search path.


*** UI ***
------------------------------------

- Fixed an issue causing custom UIs to show bad data in unused buff slots.

- The Task display now properly displays tasks with a large number of
  elements.

- On character select, if you want to go back into the tutorial, just click
  the tutorial button below the list of characters. It is no longer a
  toggle button.


*** Miscellaneous ***
------------------------------------

- Increased the maximum level range spread for LDoN adventures from 7 to 10
  so you can now group with someone 10 levels above or below you.

- Critical heals now produce a message similar to other spells that crit.

- Fixed corpse looting bugs for corpses that have been summoned or moved
  out of dynamic zones.

- Closing multiple bags while using the bank no longer causes the client to
  crash.

- The raid locking system had various bugs which are now fixed. Please let
  us know if you encounter any problems with the raid tool.
