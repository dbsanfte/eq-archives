Hi,
Just wondering, I currently have the Wu Gauntlets, which have done my fine
up till now (lvl24), but I'm considering doing the inlaid gem gauntlet quest
thing, or the treants fist quest. Any of these gauntlets a worthy successor
of my Wu gloves? And is it really worth it as such (especially the roundtrip
bit for the inlaid ones).
Or should I possibly just stick with the Wu's for now ? Statswise they don't
look too different.

Thanks in advance for any ideas or pointers.
H.
