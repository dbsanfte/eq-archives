Hmmm...  So, I have a question about where this is going that will be
somewhat of a yardstick.  But first, let me begin with a story. :)

Right now, I have a brand new troll shadowknight on Stromm (my only
character on the server).  The whole point of this character is to
check out the new tutorial and lowbie armor quests.  It has been great
fun starting literally from nothing and building the character from
scratch.  Buying bazaar gear would run counter to the whole point of
this experiment, so I am mostly not doing it.  What I cannot avoid is
"twinking" the character with my accumulated knowledge of the game,
including tradeskills.

So far, I have done a few things that are grey and probably some that
would be forbidden, under Rumbledor's rules.  Perhaps they will serve
as starting points for discussion. :)  Most of my gear is from the
tutorial.  (By the way, the No Drop tutorial gear is *quite* nice, if
you are starting untwinked!)  I exited the tutorial twice to hunt some
mobs with decent vendorable drops, while they were still blue (so far,
I have drawn a line at farming greens purely for cash).  Again, I
decided to avoid using any bazaar-buyable gear, at least until I see
how the gear from the new quests turns out.  I gave in to four moments
of weakness.  I bought an Opal Encrusted Stein in the bazaar, because
not even troll vendors will give a troll good prices.  This is a
tradeskill product, not a monster drop, and does not require any
monster drops to make.  On the other hand, someone at my current level
would simply not have the resources to have a skill high enough to make
it.  I found a Shiv (5/22 piercer) and a Netherbian Chitin (AC 20 plate
BP) on sale on NPC vendors that I happened across (skilling up smithing
to sharpen a rusty weapon for an upgrade!).  These sell *very* cheaply
from vendors (<1 and ~6 plat respectively).  I love these kinds of
"lucky breaks", so I bought them.  I also found a Great Reptile Tooth
that someone had sold to a vendor!  My finely honed bazaar trader
instincts would not allow me to pass that up for only ~18 plat, even
though that wiped out my savings.  I thought about selling it in the
bazaar for a small fortune in cash, and I somehow managed to leave it
in my bank, for now.  I am almost done with the tutorial, and I have
found a better weapon than the Shiv, but the quested breastplate is
inferior to the Netherbian Chitin, for those keeping score at home.
After I leave the tutorial, funds permitting, I'm considering learning
some more smithing to create banded armor.  This would be an upgrade
over the cloth and burlap that I'm wearing now in many slots.  If I
were a leather or silk class, I might have been looking into tailoring
instead.

So, it is inevitable that adventuring will cause your bank balance to
grow.  You just won't spend it all on spells, disciplines or spell
reagents, and not everyone will choose to do tradeskills.  Here's the
question.  If you do allow purchase of items, will this mean that, even
within your new guild, banded and studded leather armor will be
obsolete?

What about the journeyman/expert DON armors?  If I were twinking a new
alt, I wouldn't even consider journeyman DON armor, due to much better
bazaar alternatives.  For those keeping score at home, the journeyman
DON breastplate has better AC than the Netherbian Chitin, which can be
had by killing a level ~25 named.  A large downside to journeyman DON
smithing is the expense of the components (10.5 plat investment in the
hammer, ~18plat for the cultural metal for one attempt, plus a rare
farmed component).  I would probably have to charge around 20 to 35
plat per piece, just to cover the cost of failures, once I had
completely trivialed banded armor.

If I could get a queue of guildies lining up for me to make them banded
armor, I might just join this new guild.  :)
