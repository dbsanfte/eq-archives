ROFLMFAO

(HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA)


oh man, last summer i was a total eq addict, and was a waitor also. . .

so when i brought checks, i would bow like a DE in the old models w/ old
animations


when i trained people, i would put my hands up like brackets (they thought i
was being george bush sr.)


my friend, whom i worked with (another eq head at the time) would do like
things, and it was sick but hilarious

thinks at times, "i brought this guy the wrong order! he's pissed! MEZ THIS
THING OFF ME ! TAUNT IF YA GOT IT! ON ME ! ON ME!"

or, "i don't feel like rolling silverware . . . /q ! . .. oh, that doesn't
work . . . guess i'll just put my AFK flag up"
