I read an interesting series of articles about television and its
role in modern american life; the author observed that humans
evolved in large extended family groups in close quarters, and so
always had "stories" to watch, the relationships of people around
them going on as such things always do.  Only in the past 50
years or so have we done this "nuclear family" thing, by and
large, where we live in small units with only a couple parents
and a couple kids, and even more recently have we dispersed so
that we don't have grandparents and aunts and uncles and so forth
living next door.

Television fills a basic human need for constant stories.

But most people watch it wrong (and are encouraged to do so).

Instead of turning the set on, tuning in something you want to
watch, and sitting down and taking it in, like you would a movie
or play or vaudiville act or travelling show or Ord the Hunter
telling the Hunt ( this sort of entertainment is another long
seated valid part of human life, of course), you turn it on and
leave it on, giving you constant background noise, things going
on that you can pay attention to or ignore as you wish; pretty
much like living in a cave with a couple dozen other people, or
in that farm house my mother grew up in with 8 siblings and with
aunts and uncles and their broods just down the hill.

Harlan Ellison's television column for the LA Free Press, which
curiously wasn't about what was on the tube that week (oh,
sometimes it was) but rather about the medium itself.  You might
be able to find them collected as The Glass Teat and The Other
Glass Teat.

Fun stuff.

I'm raising my kids based on the theory, and they are indeed
pretty good at ignoring the thing most of the time, which can
drive me nuts when I rent a movie I want them to actually pay
attention to!
