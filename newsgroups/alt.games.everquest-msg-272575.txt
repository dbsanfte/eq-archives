    For what it's worth, I don't know that the number of mobs needed to
advance in level is directional proportionate to the ability one has to
solo in the first place. I do know that in CoH it seems to me that a dark
blue give alot less exp than a dark blue in EQL.  I haven't parsed it, mind
you, but that is how it seems to me.  Yet, for some AT's at least, it is
much easier to solo than it is for many classes in Norrath because one has
the ability to absolutely mow throw whole crowds at them at the same time.
The fighting action is fast paced and exciting, and one (ok, I) don't mind
having to kill 500+ of them to level.  It doesn't take all that long and it
is actually fun. It all depends on how the game is balanced in this regard.

  And to give a sense of perspective on the numbers of which I speak...  I
spent a night recently in the zone Dark Astoria with my level 25 fire/fire
tanker.  This is a class that has good PBAoE and pretty good defenses.  I
was killing whites, yellows, and a few oranges and reds.  I don't remember
how far I was into the level when I started, but it wasn't very far. By the
time I left, I was on the leader board for the zone for having over 1900
kills, and I was maybe 20% into my next level.  This was over, I dunno, 4
or 6 hours, something like that. 

   I had fun, and it didn't particularly feel like grinding.  But just
looking at the number of things I had to slaughter, one might think that
CoH was far more grueling to the soloer than any of the EQ's ever were.
