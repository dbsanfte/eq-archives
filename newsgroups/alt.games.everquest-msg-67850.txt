I have spoke to others with this problem, but no one that has a solution to
fix it; hopefully someone out there does.  I have a PCI Creative
Soundblaster Live MP3+ soundcard with the latest drivers installed.  Since
SoL was released, the sound is "tinny, poppy, crackling" when casting spells
and during character selection screen, during rain/snow in the zones.

Anyone have a fix for this?

TIA, Danny
