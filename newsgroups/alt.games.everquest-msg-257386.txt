By that logic, the letter Q by itself should be pronounced 'khh', rather 
than 'cue'.  There simply isn't any rule for how 'q with no u' should be 
pronounced, so there's just no call for ragging on American education 
based on a differing opinion about how to respond to the absence of a 
rule.

That said, American education does, on average, suck.  But don't rub it 
in, ok?
