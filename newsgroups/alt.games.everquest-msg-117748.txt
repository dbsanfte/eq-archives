Heh - the one person I always feel sorry is the poor girl in Chinese Yum Cha
resturaunts who ends up pushing the "roadkill" trolley. It seems they
magically consolidate the queasiness factor of the last 3000 years of
Chinese Dubiuos Delicacies all into one small 2 foot but 4 foot trolley to
be pushed around by some hapless girl who inevitably develops a lifelong
nervous tic during a single a 12 hour shift.
