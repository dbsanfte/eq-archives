This is basically how I do it also. Between berserker spirit and my rune
line the character takes virtually no damage so I don't even bother with the
pet or the memblur. As soon as I see berserker spirit fading I hit em with
another. The rune acts as a backup in case my cast is a little slow. With
the char hasted and buffed and the mobs slowed, tashed, and crippled, they
don't stand a chance. Note however that this only works for lower level
chars. Once you get to mobs that wipe out your DS in a hit or two it's not
an effective way to do it. I can keep my pet alive in this manner in
velketors(spiders)  and OOT (cyclops) without too much problem. The mobs in
sirens grotto, however, wiped my pet in no time.
