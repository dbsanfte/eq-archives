}He's a level 50 monk, he can handle the 1stone that 40pp would way.

I'm sure he could.  Now, whether or not it's the best strategy to emply 
when equipping himself, I'd say is rather more his concern than ours.  
That means, after all, that he'd have to give up one stone worth of armor 
and/or weapons.  Which is more than half of a complete set of Wu's...

}Or he could do like almost every other monk in the game and have some
}kind of coin-purse.

There is no conclusive evidence that the sparkle purse from Sol A actually 
reduces coin weght as it is supposed to.  The other alternatives in coin 
weight reduction that I know of drop off rather high level dragons.  It's 
good to see that you're also wiling to choose Kael faction for him, and 
assume that he has been able to obtain relatively uber gear by level 50.  
Or expect him to spend many, many, Kpp on such an item, if any of them are 
even droppable.  And even -then- they only cut coin weight by a 
percentage.

But please, tell me what it is that every other monk in the game has that 
I don't.  Because I'd -really- like one.

}As to the suggestion that he couldn't run to the bank, he's a fucking
}monk, he's pretty much forced to be bound in a city (yes, I know of
}several melee bind points that aren't in cities, but I've never seen
}another person bound in any of them), and if he can't hit the damn
}bank when he's there, he's an ass.

Here, I have to admit, you have a point.  Although many is the time that 
I've been bound in the city near a bank, and had the rez box pop up 
suddenly and without provocation during the 30 seconds it took me to run 
to the bank...  I'll be damned if I'm going to risk taking cash out and 
having the rez box close and waste the cleric's mana. :) Of course, a 
cleric that doesn't '/tt rdy for rez?' first probably isn't expecting a 
donation.  Or at least, they better not. :)

}I have taken to carrying 500pp, 6 coffins, and several stacks of
}periodots with me all the time now.  It's amazing how having those few
}things on me will make any type of group wipeout pretty much not a
}problem anymore.

Except then wouldn't those coffins be on your corpse?  that might not be 
the best place for them...
