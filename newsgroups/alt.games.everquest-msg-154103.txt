Yup, that is what I was saying too.  Sucks to be uber, so much suffering 
heh, I feel bad for them.  Me I just play, VI can screw up what ever 
they want and if I am with my friends and we are killing stuff its fun. 
   We don't care if you play a non desired class, if we like you, you're 
always welcome to have fun with us. Its them  poor uber folks that 
suffer when things change.  Someone should have a telethon.

th
some of my best friends are uber but...
