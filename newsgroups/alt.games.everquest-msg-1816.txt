/rant on
Something along this same line happens to me (and clerics in general, I
assume) when I rez someone.. They EXPECT to be fully healed after the rez.
It's RUDE of me to let them stand there with Rez effect weakness and 10%
health. Now.. they didn't ask ME how much mana I had when I res'd them. If
they are a warrior with over 1000 hps, it could take several bars of mana..
I've only got 5 bubs when FULL.. Rez takes 1 full bub of mana. Sometimes
when I get a /tell asking for a rez, they'll ask me if I'm grouped. More
often, they don't ask/don't care if I'm grouped. They want their rez, then
they want to be fully healed.. THEN they'll ask for buffs. If I give them
buffs, they'll ask "Why no symbol?". JEEZIS KRIST! What do I LOOK LIKE? A
bottomless MANA PIT???????  If I tell them I don't have the reagent, and
that the reagent cost a 1/2 plat, they'll say something along the lines of
"What kind of Cleric are you?" If I tell them I've got to go back to my
group, I get a "visit" from them in a few minutes after they've collected
their belongings so I can "finish" the job.  (It's really funny when they
ask me if they can have a Sow, too...).

 At this point in my Cleric Career, i can only Revive. People are assuming
because it's ONLY a "revive" that it's free.


One day, While fighting in Frontier Mountains:

AssholeWarrior_01 tells you: cn u rez
You tell Asshole Warrior_01: I can only revive, it will get you to your
corpse if you are in a different zone. No exp gained
Asshole Warrior_01 tells you: 4 a freind (sic) bound in arena  cn u rez him
(grrr,  lack of planning on your part does NOT constitute an emergency on my
part)

You tell Asshole Warrior_01: I'm with a group right now, They need me and my
mana.
AssholeWarrior_01 tells you: o plz, u r the only cleric in the zone
You tell Asshole Warrior_01: Fine, bring me his corpse
AssholeWarrior_01 tells you: im in FV. he is by the tree next to the front
door, his name is Asshole Warrior_02
You tell Asshole Warrior_01: grrrr...
AssholeWarrior_01 tells you: u do it yet?
You tell Asshole Warrior_01: I'm serving my group right now, I'll do it when
there is a lull and I have the mana
AssholeWarrior_01 tells you: ok

10 minutes later

AssholeWarrior_01 tells you: wen r u gonna do it?
You tell Asshole Warrior_01: How's tomorrow sound?  :oP  Alright, I'll do it
now

4 minute search for AssholeWarrior_02's corpse which is NOT by the tree.

You begin to cast Revive on AssholeWarrior_02

AssholeWarrior_01 tells you: u do it yet?
You tell Asshole Warrior_01: Yes, it is done

You run back to your group, who, in the mean time, has gone down to half
health due to StupidNoob_03's pulling after you said NO PULLS, GOING TO DO A
RES.

AssholeWarrior_01 tells you: were r u?
You tell Asshole Warrior_01: Fighting with my group in the Fort, please come
pay me when you have the time
AssholeWarrior_01 tells you: pay>?
You tell Asshole Warrior_01: Well, yes, it did take me 10 minutes of my
time, and 300 mana
AssholeWarrior_01 tells you: But it's ONLY a revive!

AssholeWarrior_02 shows up next to you.

AssholeWarrior_02 tells you: heal
You tell Asshole Warrior_02: pardon me?
AssholeWarrior_02 tells you: heal plz
You tell Asshole Warrior_01:  nevermind paying. Just let me play my game?

This has occured more than once.. Seems like no matter my attitude and my
way of dealing with these people, the reaction is the same from them...
Unless I dump ALL of my mana time and resources on THEM (with a smile) I am
a Jerk. a Bad Cleric. I'm RUDE.  I've handled this situation in many
different ways, from patience, to impatience, from roleplaying generous
person, to Pay me first, you'll get res after... I can never win.
