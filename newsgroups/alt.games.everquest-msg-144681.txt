Are you talking about the plants in FG, or the ones in Echo Caverns on the
way to FG?  If the latter, I have a question about those things: when are
they dangerous?

My Wizard ran by them numerous times at 52, and they never did anything to
him.  Since you can't target them, and they never did anything, I assumed
they were just decorative...

...until my 10 Bard ran through there and they hurt him very very much.

Did my Wizard just get lucky, or do they not bother people past a certain
level?
