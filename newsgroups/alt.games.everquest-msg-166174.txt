Disable your sound and try it again. I know, I know... that sounds
stupid as hell. But two folks in our guild with soundblasters had to do
that to get rid of choppiness. If that solves the problem, start looking
into other solutions so you can get your sound back without the
choppiness. Sound Blaster on XP seems to be problematic in that area.

If that's not it, check and see if your Radeon's drivers are up to date,
and/or possibly play around with some other drivers.
