    Until you get eight points, you won't get anything really worth having
for a warrior. Odds are you'll get the run speed, which won't help you get
XP any faster, and some of STA/regen, which won't help you all that much
(STA at your level gives you 11 HPs per alt XP point put into it). Now,
think about HPs alone - you could get 11 HPs from alt XP, or over 30 PLUS
gains in natural resist rates PLUS greater ATK PLUS greater inherent chance
to hit from levelling. Which would benefit you more, if done the fastest, to
help you level faster?

    Don't overlook the fact that some of the places you may be using to
grind XP now, like Fungus Grove, Velk's, Sebilis, etc. will still be blue at
60. So you'll be getting the exact same amount of XP per kill then when
putting 100% to alt XP, but you'll be killing stuff faster because of your
higher level. Trying for level 60 isn't easy the first time - I'd estimate
from when you ding 55 it'll be about 200 hours of solid XP grinding before
you hit maxed out level 60 - but it's worth it.
