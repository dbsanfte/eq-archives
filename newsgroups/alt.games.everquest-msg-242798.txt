   Actually, I think the whole "Let's change Bizbee's posting name to
something unflattering" game has been played to death.  To me, this takes
about as much intelligence and wit as was possessed by the 7 year olds I
went to school with who would try to torment me by calling me "Annie
Fannie".  Um... okay, so you're capable of making some sort of moronic joke
about a name.  You get to use the finger paints today!

   This whole tendency to see what sort of moronic insults can be drug from
the name "Bizbee" are why I added the line in the FAQ " if you make some
clever misspelling of a regular's posting name in an effort to win an
argument, you automatically lose that argument.  /nod."  I figured that if
I was putting that much effort into the thing, my reward should be to get
to make up one piddling little rule and hope it catches on.
