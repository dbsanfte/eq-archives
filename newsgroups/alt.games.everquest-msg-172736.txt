Hubris again.  Who needs that junk on greenies?  In fact, they should just
die when I get within five feet of them.

I dunno... 20 or 25pp per leather padding seemed worth the time and effort
of farming or assembling.  And the good thing is that are a lot of people
selling leather padding, and sometimes they get into price wars.  =)

I had to go see, just to check.  =)  I even found a third one, hidden
amongst the player vendors.  The stables one was the only one I knew about
until now.

There's a dwarf cleric on our server who also memmed all the imbues.
Despite how helpful he's been with my smithing, I hate him with a passion
born of jealousy.  :)

Oh yeah.  :)  So glad I caught that.  Mouse hovered over Hategiver before I
noticed the other hammer-looking thing.

A guy posted on the EQTraders message board, saying that with a 15%
modifying item, he could not make EE rings with a 192 raw skill, but he
could with a 193.  I wouldn't know because I was 194 before I started, so I
took his word for it.

Didn't have either memorized.  After that, I always had root up.  When I
did, the named mobs were easier.  =)

As an aside, I didn't know you could sit and mem knew spells while DA was up
at the time.  I learned that later and had it save my life a couple of
times.

Where can you buy components for 3pp?  I've been buying Scents of Marr to
make celestial essences.

What I meant is that my target goal was lowered, from 220 to 210, so I saved
time having to get skill-ups to 220.

I was honestly surprised at how high my success rate was at 243.  I hadn't
even planned on trying until I got to 220.  My success rate seems to be
about 60-65 percent, which is great.

As an aside, I haven't failed a breastplate combine yet.  Bracers, though, I
seem to fail over half the time.

Heh.  I'm considering making an entire suit of Salubrious Heraldic, just to
see what it looks like.  Maybe when my skill gets higher... failures are
expensive.

> Heraldic is big money. Big, BIG money.

I'll say.  I used the proceeds to buy up all the PoP spells I hadn't been
getting while obsessing.  During a raid tonight I used my new Hammer of
Damnation.  Proc heaven!  I even had the pally in my group going, "Wow,
Mon."

Well, true, got me there.  =)  I was quite happy.

Good.  Wouldn't mind something straightforward for a change.  =)

Hehehe.  Thanks, James.  =)
