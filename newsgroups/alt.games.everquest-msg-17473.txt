In the 40-50 range, at least against old world mobs, a Shaman is far
better than just a backup healer to a Cleric.  Given the choice between
a Shaman and a Cleric, you'd take the Shaman, if you were trying to do an
optimal XP group.  Yes, a Cleric heals better, but a Shaman can reduce
mob damage output enough that Cleric healing is simply not needed.
