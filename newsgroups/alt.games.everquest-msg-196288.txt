The problem is your argument lends weight to those who like to believe that
shamans are over powered.  People don't see Iksar BP+KEI+Troll regen+twinked
HP/AC  all they see is 19-22 in a hour non-stop pulling and ability to
easily solo as well.

At around 29 it will get a little harder because you can no longer tank as
well, yet you do not have a pet that can take damage while you stand back
and cast.  With your high HP/AC and because you are a troll it might not be
as rough for you.  At 34 with first pet it gets a lot easier and the 40's
are a sheer pleasure.  BUT it all stopped at 50.

A lot of things change and some of that has been mentioned here.  You are
levelling fast and you will see for yourself soon enough.
