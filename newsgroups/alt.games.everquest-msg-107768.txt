Heh, I was about to say something similar :)
What I do whenever I fiddle with facepick is to cycle through eye
colors, cycle through hair colors and cycle through hairstyles, then
accept the face. 
I have never touched the facial expression (I am fond of my old world
face) but whenever I didn't cycle through all three of the options
before accepting, the last one would be set to default. If I only did
my hair, my eyes would be changed back to blue when I zoned. If I
fixed the eyes and left the hair as it was, it'd be default style and
brown when I zoned. If I only fixed the hair style and didn't tamper
with the color (white), it'd be brown when I zoned.
Accepting after each isn't necessary, as long as you cycle all the
options.
(Not sure how beards work, they did strange things to the female dwarf
mule I had for a short while)
