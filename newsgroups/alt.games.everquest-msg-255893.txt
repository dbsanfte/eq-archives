That's pretty high on the weak logic scale.

To paraphrase:

I know plenty of people that spend well over $1000/month on crack and 
heroin. Spending 1000/month on just one drug, cigarettes, and not buying 
new drugs, would constitute saving money. Again not the behaviour of an 
addict, but somone trying to spend their money for entertainment wisely.

Next time you bump into an alchololic drunk in a ditch, just remember 
how much money he's saving by not flying his family to disneyland or 
attending football games. He's not an addict; he's just spending his 
money for entertainment wisely.

I -seriously- hope you can see the irony. =)
