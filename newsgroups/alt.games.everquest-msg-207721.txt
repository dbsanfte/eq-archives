I think it is a bug that they haven't fixed yet.  A few things I do to fix
this is, either if you hit trader and you can't get a spot, reload your UI..
and type /load ui 1 (not sure of the spaces, but you have to have one in
there or you will get the game default ui, which will change your colors if
you had any set and any custom UI's) and the other tip is in /bazaar.. keep
hitting welcome until you see it hit below 500, then you have a better
chance of getting a spot=)

hope this helps
