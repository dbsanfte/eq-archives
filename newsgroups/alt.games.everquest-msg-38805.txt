Sorry to burst your bubble, but there is little evidence of another metal 
for jewelcrafting in Luclin. The test server spell list for enchanters in 
Luclin includes "enchant luclinite" but it is the same level as enchant 
mitril, enchant ore, etc. that are used when helping a blacksmith make 
enchanted armor. It's unlikely that this is another in the enchant 
silver/electrum/etc. series since it matches the other ones.
