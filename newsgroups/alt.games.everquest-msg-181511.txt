So true.  Guildmate XFerred all the equip off a char, deleted him, and 
recreated him with the same name.  Oops, forgot that 15kpp on the char.  
Support said "no problem" - until they found out he had already created a 
char with the same name.  That is what erased any opportunity of getting 
that cash back.
