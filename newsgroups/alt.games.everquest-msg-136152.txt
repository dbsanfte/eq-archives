Huh? I've been playing since the day of release, I drop-twink like there
is no tomorrow, and it's the first time I hear that "drop it and it's
fair game" thing. Sometimes, I've found stuff in the same inn rooms I
use to twink; I've picked it up, and I've *waited* there for the owner 
to appear, and I've handed it to him with no more than a /wink.

What I don't understand is what part of "that stuff belongs to somebody
else, they will pick it up in a few minutes, so leave it the fuck alone"
some people are having difficulties with.
