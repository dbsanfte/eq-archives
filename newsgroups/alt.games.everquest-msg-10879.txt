More than likely. I certainly never complain when I'm soloing two or
more mobs and someone grabs one. I may not like it, but I know if I
complain about it I'll likely live to regret it. The next time I do
need a hand the guy I bitched at will stand there and laugh as I die.
:P

I read something into the first post that, looking back, wasn't there.
I assumed when he wrote that "it continues towards the first wisp",
that it attacked the first group. If it didn't then I agree with you
that he didn't KS them. That was sloppy reading on my part.
