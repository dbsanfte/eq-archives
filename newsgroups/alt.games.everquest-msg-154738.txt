I was chatting to someone in the game about having a 2nd account that i 
use purely for trading in the bazaar and although i realised i would 
have to pay the monthly subscription for both i didnt realise it meant 
buying the game again for an entire set of new cd keys
Im sure i read someone that you can just purchase the keys without 
having to buy the game again.
Does anyone know if this is the case and where i can do that?

thanks
