I don't remember it being used in the 'good old days'', but I'd venture to
say the practice started up around the time of the Kunark expansion.

I cannot help you with any strategies because I personally disagree with
that hunting style (and let's leave it at that).

I will add the Harmony was apperently nerfed as of the patch today, but I
assume (dangerous, I know) the level restriction will only apply to things
you might find in the new expansion zones.

>>>>** Patch Information **

- Reduced the maximum NPC level that Harmony can affect<<<<

I am gonna be pretty pissed if it affects previously unaffected mobs.
