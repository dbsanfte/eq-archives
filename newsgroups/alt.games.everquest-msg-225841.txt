Give it a chance to fail, make it gain more agro points the higher it gets,
just like any other skill, but it doesn't work well enough as-is.  Again,
I'm not saying that the new abilities are bad things or unwanted, but they
should fix the core of the problem at the same time.  The fail/suceed
message is a nice step in that.

Taunt is ability.  I have no problem seeing it be as reliable as other
refreshable abilities be it kicking or casting.  As long as Rangers are
meleeing, casters are nuking and healers are medding, the challenge of using
Taunt well will still remain.

Warriors are second-class citizens now.  Before them, it was Rangers, before
that, Paladins.  Unless this new plan works, there's always going to be a
"second-class" citizen who can't do enough DPS, take enough hits, generate
or remove enough agro, etc.

There's clearly a problem though.  And I never said "Make it so they taunt
each and every time and hold it throughout the fight."  I'm all for better
taunt--not perfect taunt.

I'm kinda lost.  So...  A 20 delay weapon swung 100 times will have a better
chance of proccing than a 30 delay weapon swung 100 times?  And it's that
delay, rather than actual swings, that will increase the chance of a
proc--or in this case, a special attack?

I just like knowing if my taunt is working or not.  I've always wanted one
of those messages, even before Warriors were all outta kilter.  Turning mobs
aren't always reliable, since tanks are often clustered close, especially in
raid situations.  I've got misses and other's hits filtered out, so if it's
not hitting me, I can't tell if it's just missing or if it's beating on
someone else.
