Well...

Haste wise, he just has CoF.. and i know that + speed of vallon doesn't hit
the haste cap, but its close enough to not be a major worry atm

Stats are all maxed (using ferine avatar) so this wouldn't be an issue

That raw ATK... yes please!

I went upto Hate at the weekend, rogue+wizard.  On try 1, something saw
through s/h at the spiral staircase (right by where I need to be, but
maestro would own me like that), and on try 2, while the rogue was
navigating a different route, a stupid rat agrod my wizzy at the zone-in.
With no root or snare, all I could really do was run the rogue back, and
evac out.

In like 3 more AA's I get shroud, so I'll go back then... will take chanter
too; having to evac cuz of a green rat just sucks.   With hindsight, I
should of just ran with a gate potion (the bought, insta cast, type),
looted, and gated out..  not worrying about agro.  Oh well..  nearly there
