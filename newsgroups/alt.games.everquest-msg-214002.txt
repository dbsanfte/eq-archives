Hmm, and of course even more common is a situation we've also mentioned elsewhere in
this thread; you have a mezed mob, you want to soften it up some before you wake it
up.  If you cast Snare (or ensnare) on the mob, it doesn't wake up, and you can
happily continue to debuff it with cripples and slows and so forth.  You don't even
need to be thru with the current mob, if the casters in question are no longer busy
doing things to the current mob they can start in on the mezed one(s) right away.

And if you do snare/ensnare that mezed mob, and something happens to break the mez,
or it just wears off, the mob is snared, which means the enchanter/bard/necro
responsible for keeping it snared has lots of time to get it back under control.

Use Darkness on a mezed mob and you will be fighting it now. Thats fine if thats
what you intend, but its  a lot less flexible, and doesn't provide any "save the
mezzer" insurance plan at all.

These aren't fantasy tactics for the advanced plane raid; these are simple elemental
basic ideas that apply just as much to a level 10ish group as they do to one thats
all level 65s with 200 AA apiece
