	I am in a small guild, but despite that we are still experienced players 
that can get things accomplished.  I have been in PoP since the second 
day it had been out.  I have been hunting in the tier 1 zones and have a 
good idea of how each one works.
	 My questions are the following as to what you guys can recommend for the 
way my guild should go about achieving its flags.

1. Is it possible for us to do the executioner trial in PoJ for the PoV 
and PoS flags?
2. Should my guild gather parts from the semi rare monsters that spawn 
in PoD for keys in to the Crypt of Decay or should we try killing Grummus?
3. Should we try to do the maze event in the plane of nightmare to gain 
a flag in to the plane of torment?

The people available in my guild and to use in these events are the 
following to help you better answer the questions by knowing this 
information.
woo
1. 60-61 bard
2. 61 shaman
3. 61 warrior
4. 61 ranger
5. 61 cleric
6. 58 enchanter (me)
7. 54 monk
8. 58 druid

The next couple of people are friends we can try asking.  It can go 
either way if these people would have the time for us. (We can also 
resort to picking up people who are LFG but thats only if its really 
necessary)

9. 61 beastlord
10. 65 druid
11. 62-63 wizard

Besides answering those questions anything else you can recommend quest 
or flag wise for my guild would be great.

Thank you
