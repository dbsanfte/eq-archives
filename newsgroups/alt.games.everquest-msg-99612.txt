I have been searching for the last 3 days for the Luclin Bard Songs.  I
heard last night from a level 60 bard that they are in Katta...Is this real?
There is a level 9 bard song and to get to Katta I have to go through a
level 50-60 zone?  I never really complained much about eq because hey I am
the one willing to pay 10 bucks to play it if I don't want to I don't have
to.  But can someone else confirm that this is wihere the songs are?
