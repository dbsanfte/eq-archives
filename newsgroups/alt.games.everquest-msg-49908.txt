Cutting downtime in half wouldn't hurt the game at all i think but
make it better. Groups would still want crack and mez from chanters
and clerics would still be very needed to keep groups alive. I
remember with my druid those up to 10mins to get mana back was just
silly and this is my only real complaint about eq and it a major
downside :(. Well also more 51+ dungeons wouldn't hurt.
