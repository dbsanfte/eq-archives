Here is my conversation with Customer Service about my complimentary move to 
a server of my choice, as opposed to Sony's choice:
I had asked when I could choose a server to move to after being forced off 
my server.


You have been connected to CSR Oliver D. .
CSR Oliver D. : Hello Paul, Thank you for contacting Sony Online 
Entertainment. One moment please, while I read your question. Thank You!
CSR Oliver D. : What do you mean forced?
Paul Clay: Solusek Ro was eliminated, I was not given a choice, therefore I 
was forced off Solusek Ro
Paul Clay: When can I choose a server to move ot?
Paul Clay: to?

Paul Clay: That was not answered last night by a GM
Paul Clay: I attempted that
CSR Oliver D. : They will reply back.
CSR Oliver D. : Your ticket is in a queue and will be replied to 
accordingly.
Paul Clay: They told me they didnt' know
Paul Clay: that was the reply
CSR Oliver D. : Unfortunately that is an in-game issue in which only a GM 
can address.
CSR Oliver D. : Tech support cannot make any changes in-game.
Paul Clay: Well then it would seem I am stuck with the choice that was made 
for me
Paul Clay: Or am I hearing your response and last night's response 
incorrectly?

CSR Oliver D. : Please contact in-game to see what can be done.
Paul Clay: Server moves are an in-game function?
CSR Oliver D. : If they state that nothing can be done, then unfortunately 
that is where it stands.
CSR Oliver D. : Did you request for /movelog?
Paul Clay: Yes, it is blank
Paul Clay: If nothing can be done, doesn't that contradict the description 
of the server moves at the EQ home site?

CSR Oliver D. : Please contact them again for further assistance, as I 
stated above this is out for our departments hands.
CSR Oliver D. : We cannot move characters.
CSR Oliver D. : Is there anything else I can help you with today Paul, 
besides your current issue? If not, I apologize and regret that I must end 
this session.
Paul Clay: I would expect nothing less
