The difference is speed of the horse/drogmor.  The horses have somewhat 
different prices based on color, and big differences in prices based on 
speed.  The 100k+ horse/drogmor is the fastest purchasable mount, and 
runs at faster than sow speed as I recall, somewhat slower than max bard 
speed.

The real advantage to a mount is that you are always meditating if you 
are not moving and you are not attacking.  Even while casting spells, you 
are meditating, this makes a huge difference in your mana regen rate, 
better than KEI, and, you don't get sit aggro.  This is true of all 
mounts, including the cheapest ones.
