    I imagine they released the policy publically to get people to stop
making more bad names or /petition to get existing bad names changed out of
fear. Then, they could slowly pick off the remaining names as they were
/petition'ed. It also gives them another sword to deal with problem
customers, whom I imagine they just want gone anyways.
