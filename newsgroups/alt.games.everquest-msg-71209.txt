I have 3 systems 1 Win98 512mb P3-550mhz Ati 32mb Rage Pro Video System 2
Win 2k 512mb P3-500mhz Nvidia G Force 2 32mb
System 3 Win XP 1gig P3-933mhz Nidia G Force 2 32mb SB PCI 512

All 3 have everquest loaded system 1 Win98 is very stable can log different
accounts with no probelms plays reasonably smooth also has longest zone time
by 15 seconds
System 2 very stable zones quicker but has 2 minor problems false mouse
pointer in middle of screen ( Have to cycle through display resolutions to
clear) also will lock up in EQ if I log out of 1 account and log into my
second account without reseting computer.
System 3 same mouse pointer problem and was a bit choppy till I increased
memory to 1gig. Now the main EQ machine
