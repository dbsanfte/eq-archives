Lol, I joined a guild a couple months ago, then found out 2 of the members
are from New Hampshire like I am.  Since New Hampshire is the size of a
shoe-box, there are many different servers, many different guilds on each,
the odds of this are pretty slim.  The even odder chance is, one of these
people I met once over 15 years ago when we had a fender-bender when someone
running a red light ran us both off the road at an intersection.

No shit!  What are the chances of that?
