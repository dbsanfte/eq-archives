"probably an insignificant percentage"

How many people do you know have manastones (besides all those level 8s
willing to trade their manastone for a few level PLing <g> )?  I know of one
and I know a lot of people.  I think that "insignificant" is putting it
mildly.  It would shock me to find out there's more than 100 per server in
existence when they were removed from the game, 2.5 years ago (10/22/99 per
a news search at castersrealm).  Maybe a total of 1500 out of 400,000
accounts (.375%).

Why the hell is this an issue?  It's not like any of the 99% of the
complainers will ever even SEE one, let alone OWN one.
