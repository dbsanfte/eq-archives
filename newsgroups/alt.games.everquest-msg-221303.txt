I disagree, we have a long long history we can look back at if
you think knights are desirable in groups where warriors are the
best tanks.  See, all three are "sponge" classes, they absorb
damage.  But its a rare group that needs more than one damage
source absorbed at a time; whether using FD pulling, Pacify
pulling, or Mez parking or Root parking, most groups have one guy
standing in front of the one mob that's doing damage while the
rest of the group stand behind or off at a distance.

If any one (or two) class are significantly better at the job
than the others, then thats the class you want to go with unless
there simply is no other choice.  Knights saw this for years,
people would only grudgingly accept them if they really couldn't
find a warrior to do the job instead.  Now the situation is
reversed.. and redoubled; instead of two classes being looked
over for a third, one class is being looked over for either of
the other two; all things being equal there's twice the chance a
group will be able to find a knight instead of the warrior as
there was that a group would be able to find a warrior instead of
a knight.

Since I very much like the idea that there should be three
classes available to do any major job (three healers, three
mezzers, three slowers) I don't want either warriors or knights
to be the far better choice for the sponge role.  The trouble is,
its much harder to find a balance than it is to make one or the
other much better than the rest.  

Once upon a time, the balance was that knights got aggro quickly
and held it better, making them better at keeping the mob off the
robes, healers, and backstabbers, but took more damage and had
less hp to absorb the damage with, making them more expensive to
keep healed.  This wasn't balanced, though, because aggro wasn't
a big issue, casters with a little caution could still do full
damage to the mobs without ever taking aggro, and slow didn't
-have- to go on instantly when the mob showed up.  The bottleneck
was healer mana, and that meant a warrior (or monk, but thats
another issue) was the way to go as he'd save healer mana.

Now, though, the shoe is on the other foot.  There's far more
mana available than there once was, and the mobs people go after
hit so hard and fast that its highly important that they be
slowed ASAP.  Even if the three tanks were exactly as they were
long ago, you'd still want a knight instead of a warrior for the
exact reason that you used to want a warrior instead of a tank;
with the mob slowed sooner and the robes pouring more damage into
it it dies faster, saving the healer mana.

Worse, though, knight ability to get and hold aggro has improved,
because they have more mana available and can still use their
cheapest spells to do the job.  Further, gear available to all
three classes, and buffs which hit all three classes, both
increase the total HP and AC of all three, eroding the inherant
difference in AC and HP between them.  To retain their old
position as "not as good at aggro but better at sponging"
warriors would need a large boost in AC and HP, and even then
would need some boost in aggro because right now they aren't "not
as good" they are "far far worse".

What would I do?  Well first I'd rewrite the AC algorithm
completely so as to make differences in AC significant over its
entire range, not just a narrow range per mob.  Then I'd give
warriors a larger AC multiplier than other classes.  What does
this mean?  Well, when my cleric puts on a 10 AC piece of gear,
he gets an increase of 20 to his AC.  Give warriors 25 for that
same 10 AC.  Unfair?  Yes.  But balancing without having to
create a whole new set of warrior only armor.  And it would
address warrior role over the entire run of the game, rather than
just POTime capable warriors with 120 AA and 5600 LDON points. 
Further, I'd give warriors an HP multiplier that applies to their
stamina, gear, and buffs; buff a normal person with 100 HP and
you buff the warrior with 120 HP.  Again, this addresses the
problem without requiring the creation of a whole new set of
warrior only gear.

Does the AC thing sound like a big change?  Well it is, but they
did the same thing a while back with resists; total massive
revamp to the algorithm.

That would restore the warrior to his position as "has more HP
and takes less damage", but would still leave him far behind the
curve on aggro.  What warriors need is a way to generate aggro
more reliably.  I think that the solution would be simple, again,
mucking with game mechanics to give the warrior an advantage.  In
this case, the Taunt skill seems like the natural mechanism. 
Currently, taunt works about one time in three.  What if it
worked, for warriors, 90% of the time.  Then warriors would still
lose aggro easily if their groups weren't careful, but they'd get
it back quickly, establish it initially quickly, and with a
little cleverness could easily get Lots of aggro, simply by
timing taunt to happen immediately after high aggro events (have
the cleric cast a stun, for example).  Warrior hate items would
still also be an important part of their ability to generate
enough aggro to allow casters to go at full speed.  And you could
still get in trouble with a warrior MT where the knight would be
more reliable... there just wouldn't be as large a disparity.

If you wonder why warriors should get such special treatment,
look at ranger track; its not merely longer range than druid or
bard track, its far more useful due to the track sort options
that only they get.  Look at rogue hide/sneak; other classes (and
some races regardless of class) get one or the other or both, but
Only rogues can use the combination as mobile invisibility, and
invisibility to all at that.  Look at monk FD, which is instant,
not interruptable and no mana cost to it; yes, SK and Necros can
FD too, but monks are better at it.

I'd also go in and fix riposte so that riposting with two weapons
in hand happens more often; probably by allowing a dual weild
check so that there can be a second chance to riposte each blow
coming in.  Also, riposte chance should be based on weapon speed;
the faster the weapon the more likely a riposte should be. 
There's a reason riposte is a fencing term IRL while you rarely
see it done with a Flamberge; it requires speed and finesse.  I
would not, however, uncouple it from opponents swing rate,
riposte should be sort of like a damage shield, doing more damage
the more the opponent swings at you.

WHy do this?  Well, for one thing, it makes sense, people
shouldnt' be looking for something huge and clunky in order to do
fancy fencing moves with.  But also it would benefit warriors
more than knights, since they benefit from faster weapons and
from dual weild in order to increase the steadiness of their proc
rate for hate production (a faster weapon procs less often, so it
doesn't increase the proc rate directly, but more frequent tries
at a smaller chance tends to be less chunky) and increases their
damage output by more than it does knights, who don't have dual
weild to benefit from the DW part of the check.

As an aside, it would also benefit that oddity, the ranger tank,
at low levels.  Since rangers are largely an "also ran" class
until they reach the stratosphere of level 59 + many AA so they
have massive archery output, it would be handy to benefit their
ability to MT in small groups at lower levels where they still do
that.  Rogue MT, Bard MT and Monk MT would also see this
benefit.  In the higher levels, their rising inability to take
the damage would eventually still put them out of that job, but
you could better make do with them in the position at lower
levels, since you wouldn't lose as much of their damage output by
putting them in front of the mob.

How much AC should matter, how much HP should be boosted, how
much more reliable taunt should be and what relationship DW and
weapon speed should have to riposte frequency would have to be
studied carefully, go too far and knights become second class
citizens again, don't go far enough and you don't change the
status quo at all.  ITs a thankless task, and one I wouldn't
relish, but it is fun to armchair quarterback from here at home.

(ps I can't take credit for the riposte idea, it was suggested by
something... Kaev?  said in another thread)
