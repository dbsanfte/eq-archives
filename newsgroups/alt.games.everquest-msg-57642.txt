Jewelcraft is pretty much an enchanter only skill.   Anyone else will find it
much too annoying getting someone to enchant all the metals for it every
time... also your costs would be higher for having to pay someone to do it.

A warrior isnt' a very good trade skill type usually, since your success at
learning tradeskills is based on the higher of your intelligence or wisdom.
Warriors usually have neither.  If you really prefer to get a tradeskill on
this character, I'd suggest smithing.  Your strength will at least give you a
bonus with success on that skill.

Here is the best guide on tradeskills.   Can teach you what you need to know.

As for good money...  Tradeskills in EQ aren't a gold producer.   They are one
of the main gold sinks instead, where they are not time sinks as well.  If you
find a way to break even overall, you're way ahead of everyone else.
