I would suggest that you look at the list of items available from each camp
at

http://www.cardplace.com/eq/ldon/list.cgi

or

http://www.eqdiva.com/eq/items/LDoN.aspx


Generally, I think the "best" camps alternate by point level.  For example,
using the EQDiva engine, if you set the class to "Monk", type to "Armor",
slot to "Chest", and the "Sort By" to "Points", you'll see the very best
item (1492 points) is in Guk, the next best item (760 points) is in MMC, the
best item before that (442 points) is in Ruj, etc.  The big question becomes
are you going to save points for that perhaps far-off day when you can buy a
760 or 1492 item or spend them a bit earlier?
