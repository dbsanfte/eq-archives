Is he dotting?  Snaring?  Self hasting?  Mezzing?  Increasing DoT and
DD damage?  He can only have so many buffs up and still do the other
jobs you mentioned.

Well, whatever.  I dont think his buffs are nearly as critical as you
but maybe we just have to agree to disagree.

Perfect for a ghetto Necro in place of Holgresh beads as well.  However
it's not gonna work very deep in to a dungeon.  It only lasts 18 or 24
seconds.  Also consider that you can take several attempts to pet pull,
each time wasting your stalking probe.

Hmmm, not sure there are any bows with stats with the possible
exception of the Blessed Faydark and Blessed Steel (or whatever the
karana version is) bows.  You may just have to wait until you can farm
one in Velious.
