Hmm, I thought they were adding two... guess they were too busy
changing the sense heading to 200 to be bothered finishing off
actual new content?

Good move, worst thing about LDoN is the "formup" time it can
often take to find 4 people to go, and depending on gear and
composition a "normal" mission can be embarassingly easy for 4
people anyway.  Why not let trios try it, if tis too hard, whats
the harm, they just fail.

Trying to fix bard issues?  Brave you are, unsuccesful you will
probably be.

This would have made me pretty happy on a tracking character I
think, although its been long enough since I first learned to
track that I don't remember why... for some reason it was
difficult to turn tracking spam off, had to use a mouse or
something?

Wow, this bug has been in game for what, a year?  And I've never
even heard anyone complain.  Are there that few people who got
POP without already having SOL?  Hmm, they'd have to be 61+ too. 
Maybe not many at all.

I've never had that happen.  Never heard of it happening either,
but then I don't hang out on a Mage forum.

Umm, does this suck?  I don't know what that spell is, mind you,
but it seems like taking a power away in order to fix conflict
with a bard song is pretty draconian... unless cataclysm of ro is
a bard song?  Otherwise, we're talking about something that only
has even a chance of mattering when grouped with a bard, and even
then, frankly, I'd take just about any move speed enhancer over
anything in the selos line 95% of the time; selos is only really
useful when you are crossing long distances... and if you aren't
the bard, even then its nice to have SOW or something up for when
you lag out and lose the bard.

They told us this was coming, it seems to me like a massive nerf,
in the same way as the mod rod nerf (well not as big as that, but
still, quite noticable) only without making raid target mobs
easier to compensate.  Now only 1 bard per group can feed mana,
and that bard can only feed mana at the rate which any barely
competant 3 song twister can provide?  Does it stack with
Cantata, or is it even more of a massive nerf than I think?

How about the group versions of the above?  The single target
versions weren't a threat, it was group or MGB that would mess
with your more desirable mana regen based buffs!  That aside,
good idea, if you -want- to move to the cleric line, just click
your druid buff off!

This sounds like Such a bad idea I can't imagine they went ahead
with it.  Do they do any feedback at all from when they announce
upcoming plans?  If it was a single window for all tells it might
actually be nice, I use something like that now but it doesn't
pop up on recieving a tell, has to stay up all the time.  But
multiple windows popping up uncontrolably?  Ack, this gets turned
off right away!

I'll believe that when I see it.  EQ without issues?

Is that live?  I'm afraid I haven't even considered using it so
far.  Probably should try it and stop being such a luddite.,
finding traders in bazaar can be quite an annoyance.


ONE improvement (letting 3 person groups try LDoN), and how many
"who cares" and "no no no, thats not a good thing at all"
changes?

Nice patch
