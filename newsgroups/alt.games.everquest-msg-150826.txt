    This may have changed. Royals area now contains some named mobs, which
seem to pop frequently, for Jaggedpine quests. One of these mobs was light
blue to me at level 60 (so it was in the 40-44 range), and was immune to all
magic (nobody could land ANY spells on it, including me). A group in that
level range would be much better off going to Pool, with its lower level
mobs, lack of dangerous nameds, and nearby zone to Sol A for quick escape if
a pull goes wrong.
