    Or, the game isn't generating a new random number for each event.
Tradeskillers have wondered about this for a long time, since you tend to
see back-to-back skill raises a lot more often than expected when skilling
up. The theory is there's a limit as to how fast the game generates new
random seeds, or that perhaps the game generates the random seeds from the
time. So if you do two things fast enough, you'll see the same result from
both. I'd like to see the stats for the same test, only with three seconds
between spell casts. That should tell you what's going on.
