I wish people would read the entire thread. But OK, once again sorry
if it came of like that, like I said before even the kid  at
blockbuster is doing his part. But how would you like it if someone
told you  that you are disgracing proud vets for doing 15 years of
service. DT doesn't know me for shit but I willing to bet you wouldn't
like him telling you that your a disgrace after all  of your time in
service or your husbandsfor that matter. I just want to know on what
level DT has help out since it seems our time in service means nothing
to him.

So I sound stupid because a few men died and got no respect from
verant? No thats not it, I'm sure they could care less. But I really
don't think Verant thought it out, I think they just forgot to do
anything or they would have.
9/11 is over, it's late and I want sleep.
