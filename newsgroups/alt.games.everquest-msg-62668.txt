I don't think this will be an issue. The original GeForce cards were
bad about requiring more power than many systems could deliver. When
the GF2 series came out Nvidia "shrank" the video GPU (they used a
smaller silicon die) which required less power to run. Basically the
smaller you make a chip the less power it requires to drive it.

You should be OK

Cheers
