Quivver in Inventory slot one...
Fletch kit open to the left of auto-equip window...
Pack full of 2 stack of each component to the left of that...

zig-zag down the line between components and fletch-kit slots, hit combine
at the bottom, move cursor another inch to the right and drop into the
auto-equip window... drops them into ammo slot, and when full, straight into
quivver :o)

NOTE: remember to keep the 'destroy confirmation' set to YES/NO... it's all
too easy to accidentally destroy those new arrows if you're tired :o)
