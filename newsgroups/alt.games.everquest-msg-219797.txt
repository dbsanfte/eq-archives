Hi I've been hunting Jojongua in Innothule Swamp for over a week now with no
success. I've been told he spawns on top of tower in NE corner. I've cleared
the top of this tower many times and all that seems to spawn is some undead
frog and skellies. What I'm looking for here is more actuate information on
where Jojongua spawns (He's a kolbold by the way) and if there is anything I
could do to make him spawn, eg kill off Kolbolds. Any information welcome
