Weezards suck for exp groups. You are indeed correct that any other class
would add more.

On the other hand wizards solo well , not as good as any of the pet users
but good. They get ports and translocates which god knows both wizards and
druids pay out the ass for in abilities. And against yelinak or vindicator
they can do 30k dammage over the fight which is not all that bad.
