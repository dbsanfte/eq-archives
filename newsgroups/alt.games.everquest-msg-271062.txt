Beta is a form of triage. No game of this nature will ever be released
bug-free. It's the job of the developers and managers to decide when a
product is "good enough".

I assure you, every single program you buy commercially was released
containing known bugs. In the case of complex programs like Office or
Windows, hundreds to thousands of them.
