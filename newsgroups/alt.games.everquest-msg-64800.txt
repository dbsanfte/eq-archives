Ah ha!  I logged in to pose a RAM question and you all are already dealing
with it!  Yeah!!! Here's the deal...  We had thought that all we would have
to do is add more mem and a new vid card to this puter and then just finance
a second puter so we could have our accounts on seperate machines...  Well,
upon calling Gateway this morning, I have learned that this current machine
has a max capable RAM of 384.  So, back to the Gateway site I went and got a
quote on another machine this time w/o monitor or speakers of course since
we'll just keep these....

Now, I was going to ask just how big a problem the 384 RAM would cause if we
decided not to get a different machine and just upgrade this one.  You guys
seem to be discussing this very subject so please, anyone else that has SoL
installed with only 384 RAM join in the convo.  I mean, if it is simply a
matter of not being able to see all of the new characters exactly as someone
with 512 can, I can deal with that.  However, if there are going to be other
problems, I'd like to know.  We can get both of these machines for around
$3000.00 so I'm not too terribly upset with the price, but spending half of
that for only one new machine and some extra RAM and vid card is always
preferable.

Thanks in advance,
