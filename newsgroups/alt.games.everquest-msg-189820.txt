You guys REALLY need to find some better groups. A good group will ALWAYS 
get faster exp than a solo player. Yes, the soloer will get more exp per 
kill, but will have more downtime and much higher risk. A good group 
chain pulls (never stopping, as one is about to die another group of MOBs 
is coming in) and has a super high DPS and efficiency.
