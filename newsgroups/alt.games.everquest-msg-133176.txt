Great idea.  How about we start with working on future adults, who are much
more easily taught these concepts, perhaps there will be fewer such adults
when they grow up.  Actually, how about we try teaching both at once?  I

but, if it can help just a little bit on one or two evils, that's a good
thing, isn't it?
