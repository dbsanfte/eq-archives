In the Ldon I was in, I do think we did not have a well balanced group. We 
had too many casters (that were NOT doing great nukes) and the kills were 
slow. We basically had one good warrior doing all the work and it was just 
too much for him.

I play Ldons quite a bit and have been pretty efficient as cleric. But on 
occasion, a badly formed group or a "free for all" of 6 or so mobs have 
resulted in deaths... and ohhh then it hurts like heck trying to "win" 
against the clock. There just isn't time for mana to regen after Rez and 
Temp and heal...
