I don't get it. How can you pay one fee to SOE per month for an account and
still play two of your characters at one time.  I would love to have my 56
druid backing up the 39 chanter as I try to solo stuff.  I looked up
EQWindows, but haven't unzipped as I really don't know what to do. Please
advise.
