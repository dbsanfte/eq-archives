    I count us as just barely a pet class in that definition. My pet, if
alive, is about 30% of my DPS.

    However, our pets are constantly wiped out by AOE's or one-rounded by an
add, etc. Even with loads of buffs and summoned items, they have some
seriously crap survivability - and because shadowknights tend to be main
tanks, our pets are constantly getting mixed up in the fighting. A certain
percentage of shadowknights do not bother with their pet at all. (judging
from forum posts - in the months leading up to my departure from EQ, I did
not group with another shadowknight - they were becomming increasingly rare)

    Basically this new feature means I can *try* to convince my party
members to buff my pet as well, or pay GoDlike AA's to have group buffs land
on him, which will still be there after zoning.

    If a druid or a shadowknight is farming with their pet, said pet will
not require much in the way of gear or buffs.

    But I don't disagree - that is a 'plus', just not a very significant
one.

    Can't comment on either class really, but neither seem to use pets
enough to care either way.

Cheers,
