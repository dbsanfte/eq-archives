You're doing the spiders, they're essentially Karnors Castle part 2,
mediocre/crap loot except off the semi-rare named spawns, fast easy exp,
trains come semi-regularly.  (there was a NASTY castle train the other day
that was camping the zone line with like 20 gargoyles, GM had to come fix
it, GM rez all around though)

Personally, I prefer kobold (dog) groups, Lower dogs is one of my favorite
places to hunt, you never get trained, incredible exp, and decent loot, even
without the occasional named, the only downside is that it has a fairly
large requirement, 53+ enchanter to mez (lower gets resisted a lot, 55+
preferred), 50+ shaman for slow (if enchanter slows and mez they get too
much agro, could use a second ench I guess, but they're hard enough to come
by for just 1) and cleric for Cheal, and either a wizard or druid (me!) for
port out afterwards, because if you don't have a porter, the way out goes
right past Lord Doljonijiarnimorinar (although I think you can avoid him),
and Velketor himself.
