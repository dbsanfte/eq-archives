I run EQ on a windows XP machine behind ZoneAlarm and have no problems.

I just have to remeber to update the eqgame.exe and the EverQuest.exe after
the patch and restart the game. To change them to the newer versions I
delete the old ones from the files list of ZoneAlarm and then drag and drop
the new exe's into it and allow the permissions for them to be able to talk
to and recieve data from the net.

It's little bit of a hassle but it works just fine.
