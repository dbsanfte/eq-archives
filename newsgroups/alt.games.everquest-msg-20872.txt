I've never used Outlook Express as a general Usenet reader, but I have
used it for private news systems, so I'm sure it works.

The general tradition in Usenet posting includes brevity (as in, cut
all the stuff in the reply that you're not replying to), and quoting
before replying.

This means that the conscientious Usenet poster will need to make a
bit more effort to post a well formed message, but you'll find it
becomes automatic behavior pretty fast.

For the quoting before replying, or bottom posting, all you really do
is just cursor down to the bottom of the text you're replying to. It
isn't an OE setting or magic or anything, just use the mouse or the
arrow keys to position yourself at the bottom of the text.

For the brevity, cut out all the portions of the automatically quoted
message that you're not specifically addressing. Quoting is best used
as a tool to remind the reader of what was said before, not to give
the reader the entire thread again.
