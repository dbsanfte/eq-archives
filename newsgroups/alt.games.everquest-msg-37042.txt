Crystal Caverns may be a good place to advertise. I think there's still
stuff there for you to fight (Stalag Terrors etc), plus the zone itself
is not bindable - sensible casters will have bound outside in the Rygorr
fort, but even then you really need lev to get down to the dwarf town
inside.

The upshot is, anyone dying there is often seperated from their corpse.
Melees are stuck a couple of zones away in Thurgadin or Kael Drakkel and
would often be grateful of anything, even a revive. Casters may or may
not be able to get back to their corpse, even though they bound just
outside the zone.

Every time I've been to the dwarf town in CC, there has been a pile of
corpses dragged there - many virtually naked (obviously hoping for a
rez). There are often no rez-capable clerics around though, given its
mainly a low to mid 30s zone.

The problem, as a cleric, will be getting to where the action is. The
zone into CC is a teleport Crystal in the back of the Rygorr fort in
Eastern Wastes, and the town inside is at the bottom of a big pit full
of Rygorr miners. You may need someone to invis and lev you to get
anywhere people are hunting.

The other place I can think of offhand is Mistmoore - there's been a big
pile of corpses at the zone every time I've been in there.
