AC is not king. AC is god. The only thing to take over AC are resistance
pieces for specific fights (as a paladin, you'll have need of both fire and
cold resist for getting your epic books, and AC does not matter against
nagafen and vox).

>One piece of jewlry, lets say, offers +65 to HP and +65 to mana

The first is better than the second.

A jagged band is better than both, so is a platinum or velium fire opal
ring.

>I just want some general ballpark answers./opinions.

Actually, it is a very easy question to answer.

>For example is it worth giving up 3 AC to gain 3 STR

Never.

>Is it worth giving up 3ac and gaining 30 HP

There might be circumstances for this, but they are rare, and certainly
nothing that a level 42 will be facing.

>Is it worth giving up 3str to get 30 hp.

Yes...str is pointless except to help you carry more.
