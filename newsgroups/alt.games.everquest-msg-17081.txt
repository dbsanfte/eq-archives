Yeah, but proving it would be difficult. I mean, I've got log files -
which are easily modified, and hence useless as evidence - and screen
shots - less easily edited, but still do-able, and with careful
selection can be made to tell several different stories, and hence
also useless as evidence.

The only way that it could really be proved would be for a Verant rep
to dig through their own logs, which I have to assume would be tedious
in the extreme, and more effort than even I think the case is worth.

Of course, petitioning him would help establish a paper trail of this
kind of behavior, which is a Good Thing. Next time I'm in the game,
I'll do so.
