Can we just copy and paste all the silly, "I can't log into EQ" posts from
the last patch day into today's posts and be done with it already?! Sheesh.
Unbelievable how the same inane questions and "Where's my $1.37 refund?!"
gripes just get repeated over and over and over and...

It's *patch day*! You knew it was coming. If you didn't, it shouldn't be too
hard to figure out if you take the time to read any of the posts today.

/rant off
/rant on (why bother)

Rumble

And yeah, I realize full well that this particular post is *also* repeated
every patch day. Didn't want to feel left out.  :)
