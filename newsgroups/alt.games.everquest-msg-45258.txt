    Won't help. People know you need it for your epic, and will still hunt
it so they can bend you over to do a multiquest with them. If VI wanted to
stop the insanity there, they'd somehow make the Cloak step of your epic be
done in some sort of No Drop combinable container, so you couldn't MQ it.
THEN making the cloak Mage only would stop people from gacking it on sight.
