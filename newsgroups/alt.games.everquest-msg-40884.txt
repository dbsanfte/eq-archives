Greetings,

As a DE necromancer I am pretty much KOS in Qeynos. But it is my dream to
walk my pet through Qeynos streets :) Maybe a foolish one, but oh well ...

Anyways, I went in Blackburrow and pet got in a killing spree. They give
good faction with Qeynos guards, merchants and druids I think. (of course
after that I went and killed treants so my druid/ranger faction is screwed
forever. But who cares about that ?). After 3 hours and after piles and
piles of dead gnolls, I went outside and conned the first guard. Dubiously.
Yay! :) So, I zoned into Qeynos newbie area and approached the gates. Guards
there still dubious, Lashun Novashine scowling but green. Good. Just as I
was pondering the matter I got double hit for 330 and promptly died. Doh! I
respawn, scroll back and sure enough there was this priest dude or something
who took offence if my necromancers ways ... How the HELL can a priest hit
for 300 ?? I calmed down and came to the conclusion he must be on Priests of
Life faction. Priests, for some bizarre reason, do not like necromancers
*grin*. So I did a quick web surf and I found out that putrid skeletons give
positive faction with Priests of Life. I am not in the process of farming
the skell camp in SK. I imagine I need to kill couple of zillions putrid
skells :)

My question is: has anybody tried this ? Do you know of a necromancer that
walked freely in Qeynos ? Or should I not bother ? :)
