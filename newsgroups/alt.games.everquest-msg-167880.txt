Hehe, neither do i Mike, since you cant sell othmir caps to vendors, 
they dont buy them :)

But i dont get people that wanna try to buy you out sometimes. I been 
selling a LOT of othmir hats, and had a guy come over and buy 1/3rd of 
my stock, and they put those for sale at 6X the price im charging. That 
just dont work when you right from the start can see a merchant got 60 
for sale, and you then just buy 20 and sell those for 6X the price.
