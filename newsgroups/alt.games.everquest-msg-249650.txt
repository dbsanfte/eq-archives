They sort of did this in Velious originally.  You could not be ported to the
dragon circles unless you had a tooth from that circle.  Most people seemed
to think this was pretty cool--at first.  Then the problems set in.  Say you
have a group and decide you want to go to Cobalt Scar.  Then you find out
that one group member has never visited CS and so hasn't picked up the tooth
yet.  Oops.  So the group either has to ditch that person, pick something
else to do, or take the long way to get that person their tooth.

This sort of thing can work OK when what you do to get flagged or keyed or
whatever is a significant accomplishment in and of itself.  E.g., having to
master one plane before getting access to the next.  But when they
accomplishment is just "Got SOW and spent 30 minutes running across a
continent" it is just annoying.
