MIcrosoft operating systems run on the pc, they are not the pc. That
is how Apples are different. Its funny that apple tries to spin it the
other way, but apple is the closed system while the PC is an open
system. The advantage of the PC is lower cost and more operating
systems to choose from, millions of vendors with replacement parts of
all kinds, etc.

For example, my next pc upgrade will consist of a new motherboard,
proc and Nvidia 4200 128 meg geforce 4 card which all together will
cost me less than $600 for what is essentially a new computer. Toss in
the old stuff and 'voila!' Even if I have to get a new case and
powersupply that is only 35 - 45 bucks.

With apple you are stuck upgrading from apple, for a premium price.
Most apple users probably just get entire new systems ever couple
years and are married to one platform. I run 98, xp and Suse 8.0 linux
on my pc. A while ago other vendors were making apple for a bit, like
motorola I think but then apple stopped that. Now I guess they are
letting them again?

As a part of history, the opening up of the 386 platform was due to 
the ability to run around the law of a then probably unknown company
know as Compaq. Compaq at that time was trying to make a niche
product, a "compact" pc (the predecessor to the modern notebooks, sort
of) This was after the IBM pc was out and doing well. Compaq was
familiar with the law and knew that they could not reverse engineer
the ibm directly. They found a loophole and what they did was have one
team of engineers look at the PC and how the CPU and such worked and
then take notes on what it did and how it worked. A second team then
looked at that info and then designed a computer which did the same
thing in the same way, a clone in a way. Likely due to that happening,
the same thing can't happen with such closed platforms now ;) So the
compaq came out then. This is also partially why microsoft is who it
is today. Microsoft was only paid per license use for software on the
IBM, that alone would have not made them the entity they are today.
After compaq built the compaq, they needed the OS that ran on the PC
so went to microsoft. Microsoft was smart enough to be only selling
licenses to IBM and not full rights so they had no trouble in also
licensing the OS per compaq sold. Eventually of course more 386 type
clones popped up, all of which also needed microsoft operating
systems.

All of that is the reason why the PC is so cheap and open and Apple is
so expensive and closed. Microsoft was smart and only sold the OS, to
what eventually became thousands of computer makers. This is betting
on a sure thing. Apple was not smart and only MADE the OS for
computers that IT sold. If compaq or IBM went belly up, microsoft
would be unaffected. If 37 pc makers went belly up, microsoft would be
unaffected. If Intel went belly up, there is still AMD, microsoft
would be unaffected.

The smartest thing apple could do would be to make OSX for the 
i386 platform and sell it for 79 bucks or so. The problem is they know
that they'd no longer sell even the meager market share they have now
of apples. In the long run they'd at least compete with microsoft. If
they did that I'd be quadruple booting on my affordable, upgradeable,
open PC platform.

Oh and have lots of fun playing EQ on the apple in SPRING OF 2003!
You apple users should have plenty of room since the rest of us will
likely be in SWG and shadowbane. Who knows, you might have Star Wars
Galaxies on the apple by 2006.
I never really get apple owners, everything you can do on the apple
you can now do on the pc cheaper but the reverse is not true at all.
