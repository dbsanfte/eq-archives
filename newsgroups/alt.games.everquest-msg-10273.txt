My 5th lvl halfling druid decided that she would become a tailor. I have a
small sewing kit and have made a few silk swathes (or whatever you get when
you combine 2 spider silks) but I have seen no skill increase. Anyone got
any tips on tailoring? And where can I buy a large sewing kit and what's
better about one?
