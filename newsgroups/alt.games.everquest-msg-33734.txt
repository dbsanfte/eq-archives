Personally I'd max out stamina first then put the rest into strength 
after putting the five into dex, but that's just MY opinion. I'd rather 
have the extra hp's rather than delude myself into thinking I can 
actually do any sort of meaningful damage in the later levels. But as I 
said that is my opinion.

Yes they would. The only thing really missing from the equation is snare 
(or snare effect). Other than that, they MAY be one of the optimal duos.

I've never noticed it. I've been duoing with my fiance for pretty much 
the last year and have not been told I play different on raids than in 
normal playing. MOST of the raid planners I know don't give a hoot about 
HOW you play as WHAT you play. Hmm nother tank? Sure join group A. Of 
course reputation counts also.... if you're an idiot you're NOT going to 
get invites and will most probably get blacklisted. Do your job, pay 
attention and try not to let the entire group (or raid for that matter) 
get wiped out and you shouldn't have a problem.

You probably won't play much different in either case.

The only REAL difference is the bonus by not having more. You're still 
doing the same job as with a larger group. You will probably be picking 
up others in your duo anyway.... maybe not on a regular basis but enough 
to get a sense of what you're doing. But in either case your play style 
won't change much.

In later levels (after 30ish I believe) the general rule is yourlevel/2
+yourlevel is the highest you can group with to get xp. If your friend 
starts an ogre shaman also you should still stay relatively close 
(unless you change him to your main). I don't REALLY think it will hurt 
your friend too much either. The same things he/she is going to be doing 
with just you in the group are pretty much the same things that he/she 
will be doing on a raid (more likely he/she will be doing LESS on a raid 
then with just the two of you). I know I've learned MUCH more on how to 
play with just two people than in a group of six, especially if you can 
take the same mobs as a group of six would.
