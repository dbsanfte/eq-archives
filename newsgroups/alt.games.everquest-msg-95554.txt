I disagree.  Being able to survive a train because you have Running Speed 3
is a very cool thing.

Now, once I get there (RS2 right now) I'll put it away until 60 (56 now) but
I want that speed.  Many of us aren't blessed with being able to KS the AC
in SRo or have the patience to camp the AC in OOT or have the cash to buy a
horse or tboots.
