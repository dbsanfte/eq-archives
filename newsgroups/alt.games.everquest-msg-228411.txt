I'd settle for the drops or spawns just being more *common*. I have an
advantage on test of being able to wait for a server down; if I had to
camp both comm1 and comm2 along with the insignia camp I did
eventually do, I wouldn't have ever bothered to see emp let alone VT.
Life *way* too short!

And let's not get started on the ME shard dropper spawn... or FG's
drop rate....

I still think the VT key was a joke among EQ developers to see just
how far into tedium an EQ player would be willing to go to get into
the most boring zone in the game simply for its high quality drops.
