Impressive. Sure is a beautiful mob, like a ghostly mutated pegasus of 
death. What'd it drop?

Thanks. I had posted a version of this story to our website so everyone knew 
what had happened and my first log in the next morning, a guildmate told me 
that the Cheiftain was up. We assembled a crew and got them out there in 
minutes and finally took him down.

The Icegill cheif was a different story. Here we really screwed up. We 
camped him long enough to start getting tired and sloppy and soon some of us 
were wandering around the island, harvesting, etc, when the big, three-group 
pop occurred and several of the group were caught with aggro. It got a bit 
out of control and the Wizard (a recruit) jumped the gun and evac'd us 
without an evac call. We probably could have handled the fight, but I didn't 
press the issue. As you know, it's a long run back from there and when we 
returned we saw the very sad sight of Master Webclaw engaged by some 
passersby. :(

We'll get this last guy eventually. Camping sucks, doesn't it? It's the one 
element of EQ that I've never liked and like even less now when there's no 
experience to be had and no AA's generated. At least the rewards are still 
compelling in the end. That's one nice eyepatch.
