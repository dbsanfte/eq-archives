Verant has learned from its stupid mistakes too thats what people do. Look
at it this way could you create and run a world, i cant even begin to fathom
how hard it must be. Eq has been around over two years and still growing.
these new games are gonna have a lot of bugs and stuff to work out in the
first six months. sorry for going off here but thats what the ng is for.




Thanks to eq i know what i look like with a beard and big bags under my eyes
