With the spiders the best things to do are :

If there are lots of other low level players in the zone :

Kill other giant mobs and /ooc or /shout the /loc of NO DROPS for other
classes
Evey now an then (at least 5 mins apart) /ooc or /shout that you ate
looking for parts x y and z
Killing other mobs (the wasps and some of the bats and bears) should
make the spiders spawn more often.

If there are few low level players in zone then killing the other Mobs
for xp takes too long and offers no encouragement to other player to
help you. So simply train them to the guards. <G>

HTH,

Jim
