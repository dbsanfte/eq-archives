This isn't intended as a flame, just commentary:

Several errors here.

One, counting on a GM to do anything.  What do they have these days, one 
GM per ten servers?  These guys are busy, and squabbling over Hill 
Giants is a constant blare of noise, I'm very surprised you got any 
answer at all.

Two, contacting a GM directly.  While you apparantly got some kind of 
response, you aren't supposed to; your message should go into the 
petition queue and you should wait your turn, instead of cutting into 
line in front of the people who -are- obeying the rules.

Three, when you had a witness, instead of continuing to act normally and 
hope the bad guys would continue to do what you wanted witnessed, you 
changed your behavior.  Rooting something you are pulling in?  Seems 
like a very odd way to pull.

Four, you got killed.  Not by a GM, by a combination of your own 
inattention and bad luck.  Happens.  Happens all the time, every day. 
While it is possible to imagine instances of a GM killing you, say by 
spawning something on top of you, chatting with you isn't such an instant.

Five, you got in a hizzy over a death.  I can't tell what level you are 
from your post, but its just a death, in EQ thats a little tap on the 
shoulder reminding you you aren't a god and should be paying a little 
more attention to whats going on around you.  Most levels the worst 
penalty of a death is losing any buffs you had up.  Unless you are in 
your mid 50s, shrugging off an unrezzed death should be easy enough.

Five point one.  If you are in your mid 50s, heck, clerics aren't that 
hard to come by, part with a few pp to bribe one to run down to the 
RM/Feerroot zone line where you've dragged the body and get it rezzed. 
Mid 50s in RM you were farming HG's for cash, so you've got plenty, and 
need only kill a few more HG to make up for it.  The difference between 
96% rez and 100% rez isn't much, admittedly with the 100% you'd get full 
mana and hp, but again we are talking a few minutes down time difference.

Five point two.  You're a necromancer, one of the premier exp generating 
classes in the game.  To whatever degree exp loss is no big deal on any 
other class, its that in spades for you (similarly, my bard never 
bothered getting a rez at any level, heck, the free refill on his mana 
bar from dying was such a boost that he was probably better off dead!)

FIve point three.  You turned to run instead of FD?  I can't second 
guess that call, perhaps the cast time on it would have ended up withyou 
dead too.  But its something to think about.

Six.  KSing happens.  Its irritating.  But there's little you can do 
about it, other than mark down the people involved and avoid grouping 
with them.  If they are doing it consistently you might be able to get a 
  GM to come observe it and there's a small chance you can get them 
reprimanded for the activity.  As a general rule, you're better off just 
walking away from the situation; in the case of the HG's of RM, for 
example, there's a wide spawn area, stop pulling mobs from near the 
KSer, he's not likely to move his operation to over near your new spot, 
if he -does- then he's harrassing you, which is a much bigger charge to 
bring before the GMs.

Seven. None of this is really to disagree with you: GM service does 
suck, and players do KS and there's nothing you can do about that.  If 
thats upsetting to you, and you need a game where its not true, then 
getting out of EQ is a good plan.  You're advice to potential new 
players, similarly, is sound; while these things happen rarely, they 
-do- happen, and when they do your odds of getting the GM response you 
want are not at all good; if that seems like a big deal to them they 
shouldn't invest in EQ.

Seven point one. For me, the fact that I've been in this sort of 
situation about 8 times in 5 years of play means that although I'm 
mildly disgruntled by the kinds of thing you are complaining about, the 
incedents aren't bad enough for me to consider cancelling over them.  I 
just take them as part of the game environment (unfriendly/minimal GM 
support) or as part of the "multiplayer" nature of the game.  Heck, 
NPC's have KS'd me a hundred times more often than PCs.
