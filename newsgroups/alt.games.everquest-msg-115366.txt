Thanks for te info.

I'll went ahead and got the Lammy,  it seems to be dropping the
Mammoths and baddies a bit faster than my Jagged/Centi SS combination.
Now using the Jagged Blade in offfhand and Lammy in Primary.

Have already died TWICE because of the aggro it has attracted in a
group.  I think I'll be changing to something else sooner or later but
I dunno.

My prpblem now is finding a place for LVL 32 to hunt.  People advise
me to go to Eastern waste and get Cougars, but frankly, the mammoths
hunting has gotten a bit boring.  I don't see killing cougar after
cougar that exciting.

Many Thanks
-Sparky
