As I understand it, Tash and Mala are not unresistable, nor, I thought, are
malosi/malosini or any other diminuative.  Malo is much sought after not only
ofr its massive effectiveness, but for its unresistable....er....ness.

If OOS is also literally impossible to resist without immunity, then it should
be as desired as Malo, which fetches 20Kpp or more in the marketplace as
opposed to Mala, which is hard to rid yourself of at 500pp

As my main is a cleric, such details about resists rarely trouble me, the most
important spell I might have to stick to a target is Mark of Karn... and that
mob would have to have a pretty goodsized DS before anyone would really care
even about that.  At any rate, my point is I'm aware of such issues only
peripherally, so feel free to correct or update my thinking
