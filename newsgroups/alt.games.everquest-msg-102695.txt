I think that many people who hate "plz" are those who are asked for stuff
regularly and prefer to get respectful requests.  Saying "plz" is not at all
respectful to many people.  So far we agree.

When a stranger who says "please" for a buff from me turns around and says
"ty," it says to me "Yeah, he's probably looking for some hint of gratitude,
the bastard, so I'll throw him this bone."  Why bother wasting my mana on
them again if THAT'S the kind of thanks I get???  Fair or not, that's my
attitude.

Didn't their parents teach them about manners?  To me (80wpm, admittedly),
"thanks!" is as easy to type as "the."  Is it so out of line to expect that
THAT particular word (and "please") should be PRETTY DANGED EASY for any
English speaker level 40+ (giving even the newest typists time to get used
to the keyboard) to type in its entirety?

I mean, it's not like "please" is anywhere near as difficult to type as
"s'il vous plaï¿½t" (probably impossible for Americans in game to type, isn't
it?  I thought I heard something about foreign versions of the game but
wasn't paying much attention).
