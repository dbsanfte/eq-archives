Some need pauses, some don't.  My evade key (/attack off /doability 2 
/attack on) doesn't need a pause, but my downtime hide/sneak/ID key 
(/doabilty 2 /doability 2 /doability 3 /doability 3 /doability 5) didn't 
work properly until I switched it around to /2 /3 /5 /2 /3.  Not 
technically a pause, but still.  I also set up another key for sense 
heading and sense traps - /1 /4.  But it didn't work when I hit the hide 
sneak key and then hit that one, so I went back to binding SH to left 
key, ST to right key, and now I stand in a doorjam hitting 
uuuuuuuu3leftrightuuuuuuu (etc etc etc)

I seem to recall reading somewhere that the PP skill needed was in the 
high 100s, but don't quote me on that.  And I dunno about the MQ bit.
