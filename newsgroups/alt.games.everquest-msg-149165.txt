I suppose that makes some sense, but if (not thinking of one at the
moment) he can do something like that in an exp zone, why not?  He'd
have something useful to do and would be using his abilities to keep
an eye out for that possible rare pop.

Similarly, doing a "30 hour camp" at a spot he can get exp from also
works even if he plays only a couple hours a day, since there is no
timer that says if you don't sit out the whole 30 hours you don't get
your mob.  Chances are the same in the first hour as they are in the
last hour, it just takes an average of 30 hours to get lucky.

Advantage of the "rare pop anywhere in the zone" plan versus the
static camp, though, is that he can rely on his "camp" being open
each time he logs back in, while there's likely to be someone sitting
at a static camp, the advantage to staying put for 30 hours is you
keep your claim
