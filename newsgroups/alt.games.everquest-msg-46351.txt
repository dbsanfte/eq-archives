I started a naked halfling, Brell worshipping rogue last night, with the
sole thought in mind of running him to The Hole and parking him there
for future possible corpse retrieval purposes for our guild alliance.
However, I have never played either a halfling, nor a rogue. I picked
the combination to get hide and sneak.
  Of course, it fails nine times out of ten, but once I get them both
going ("you have hidden yourself" and "you are moving as quietly as a
cat stalking its prey") it seems you can go a long ways, sneaking past
all manner of nasty mobs. My question is, does it ever "wear off"? Or,
once successfully started, can you just go on indefenitely. (Providing
of course you don't run out of patience at creeping along at a snail's
pace.)
