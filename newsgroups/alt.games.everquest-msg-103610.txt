 I will echo this emphaticaly. I'm a level 60 Wiz, got the staff when I was
about level 40, and I still use it every single day. It has a permanent spot
in my most used hotkey bank ready to right click. It's great for pulling or
just judging range distance for nuking and lowers the target's fire and cold
resistences.
 
 The Staff of Temperate Flux is a must-have for every Wizard. I rate it right 
up there in usefulness second only to the Concussion spell.
