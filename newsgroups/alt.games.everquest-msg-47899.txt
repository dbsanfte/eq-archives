Yuk.  I gotta agree, that sounds awful.

On E'ci, most raids for busy zones are posted to the E'ci raid board.

It's by no means a guarentee that you will get it, but most non idiot filled
guilds will respect it.

Hate, Fear and now Growth are pretty much raided by schedule.

Raids are either guild raids or public raids.   Public (and semi-public) raids
are done by posting signups on the board.   The raid leader then selects
groups from among those signups, reguardless of which guild they are in. (of
course, members of guilds with reputations for being idiot filled tend to have
problems getting chosen, but I guess thems the breaks...)
