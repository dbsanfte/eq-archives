That would be evil... perhaps Rogue/Monk but of course trimmed down. No BS,
no poison. But they can only use Hand-to-Hand (no Ulaks or anything...),
Katanas, and Wakizashis -(you know what types I'm talking about). They get
Hide, Sneak, and they would have a weight limit (not as harsh as a Monk's,
but sort of close.)

Of course, I'm not a designer, but that might make things a little
interesting... I'm still wondering if FD would be over-powering,
though. -And if they get poison, perhaps less of a selection when compared
to Rogues.
