I've heard this so many times before, including from guides who've
participated in gm events. They spend all that time setting up the
plot and dialogue, for some 12 year old kid to come along with his
level 60 character and launching into an attack on one of the
gm-controlled characters. At the end of it, the attitude on their part
is usually "wtf do we even bother?"

The main problem is; GM events of this nature require no audience
participation, which rather goes against the grain in EQ's interactive
environment. You're meant to stand, watch and listen. So... to this
end, why don't they do the following:-

1) /ooc, /shout, /auction and /say are all switched off (mute-mode=ON)
2) GM event starts
3) Through the duration of the event, all GM-controlled characters
have a damage-shield buff which delivers a Death Touch.
4) GM event ends
5) /ooc, /shout, /auction and /say are all switched on (mute-mode=OFF)

This would at least make them more enjoyable for those interested in
following the storyline.
