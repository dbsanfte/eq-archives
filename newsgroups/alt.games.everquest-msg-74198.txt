which server?  sounds like a techie problem.  had one person on bristlebane
yesterday lose a bunch of his equipment on the boats.  GM came and rezzed
him after several hours of him walking around neked.  My warrior with way
too many weapons gave him an extra, worth 30 to 100 plat.  guess his trouble
I covered in more ways than one.  And gave him the 3 AC pottery made range
item.  From my over twinked Druid.
Appearantly this cleric was even a officer in a guild, and invited me to
join it, so my Druid has a guild.   : )

I've been having trouble with lighting, my items seem to have no affect on
my human's ability to see.  Using a TNT2 Nvideo card with the latest *new*
driver, wondering if I have to switch back to 5.22 ver driver again.  : (

Notice a once when zoning I would lose spells, but that could conceivably
because I'm using a 128 meg system currently and zoning is slow.  Having too
many other games I paid hard earned money for, I'm not interested in
removing for cache-ing, so that isn't an option to speed things up.
