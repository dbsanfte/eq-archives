You have to train all of the specialization possibilities: alteration,
divination, etc.  Only after you do that will one go over 51.  The
rest will rise to 50 and stay there.  Until they are all trained, none
will advance past 50.

It results in about 0.05% mana savings per specialization skill point.
Obviously, the max of 50 skill for the other skills means a max savings
of 2.5% of the mana cost to cast a spell.  Maximum value of 200 means
a 10% mana savings on spells in that area.

With maximized skills in all specialization area (one at 200 and the
rest at 50), a spell which costs 100 mana would cost 90 mana if it's
in your specialized area and 97.5 mana if not.  Obviously, it's better
to specialize (go over 50 skill) in the area in which you spend the
most mana over time because that results in lower mana usage over
time.

Note, however, that the specialization "check" comes after the game
checks to see if you have enough mana to cast the spell.  So, if a
spells costs 100 mana base, you have to have 100 mana available to
begin to cast it.  After you do, however, it would really only cost
90 mana (assuming maximized specialization in that field) and you'd
have 10 mana left.
