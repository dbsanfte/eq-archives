If there's a cleric in the group, then I think it very much is a
requirement.  If I invite someone in the party, I expect them to make
available to the party everything their class offers.  I don't see how a
cleric not rezzing is any different than a shaman not SoWing the puller, or
a bard not slowing, or a druid not snaring.  While rezzing may not
be -essential- to fighting, it is something that a cleric or paladin brings
to the table, and as long as they're part of the group, I believe they're
obligated to perform that service.  Why do you believe that the fact that
the service isn't required to hunt makes it any less of an obligation for a
group cleric?

Are we only obligated to do the bare minimum in a group, or should we do our
best?  What would you think of a bard who didn't twist?
