Not sure on prices on your server, but on my server ICC = 6000, BR = 2000
(or less), for me I would consider saving the cash and get a horse and get a
cheap acrylia studded vest (at 14 you wont notice the AC difference)
assuming of course you can raise the cash.
If you can't then get the ICC.
For a shaman in a group horse > most items. Always meding, always sit regen,
no sit agro......................
As a barb shaman I have never used a regen BP and had no trouble with canni,
once you get to 45 it gets even easier with stoicism, of course 60 with
torpor it is even better...........
