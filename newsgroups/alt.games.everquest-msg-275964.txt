just logged on to test server. was happy to see they merged bazaar and 
barter commands together in the bazaar zone. it will be nice that you can be 
both a seller and buyer now.  guess sony in their own way admitted they made 
a mistake in two seperet zones.
now if they would only redo the old bazaar without a arena =\
