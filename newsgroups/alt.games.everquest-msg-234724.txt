You're missing my point, or I haven't made it clearly.

When it comes to what they see in-game, all they see is one character giving
another character a sum of plat.  Without getting ahold of IGE's records how
are they to know that the character that gives Fred his plat is an IGE
character, and how would they know that my character loaning a friend the
exact same amount is not an IGE character?

Based purely on server logs, I don't think they can do it.  And if that's
the case, they can't go around willy-nilly banning acounts purely for plat
transfers.

But as I said .. I'm a programmer, not a lawyer.
