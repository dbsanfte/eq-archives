I've seen lots of conflicting information on mounts.

Some people say that the different color horses and drogs grant
special effects, some people say that's bunk.

What I know is that, you gain medding mana regen on a mount and the
higher quality the mount the faster it is. I assume the larger price
tags on the better material bridles, and larger drums means those are
the higher quality ones.

My question is: Is there any difference in actual size of the mount
the higher the cost, and do the various colors have any effect other
than esthetics?

Thanks,
