Wish we had a bard.  We started with ENC, RNG, DRD until our 49 ( dinged 50 
) CLC logged on, and grabbed him.  At this point, we moved down to the 
Golem bridge.  Soon after, a 53 Pally logged on and he came with us.

That's what we did.  We fought there for 1/2 hour when another group 
dropped down on the other side and started pulling.  We thought they were 
going to go further in ( the had the fire-power, and we didn't ) so we 
waited a bit, but they didn't leave.  Our groups were the only 2 in the 
zone, so we succor'd and went back to clearing the top until they left 
instead of pissing with them over territory.

Good to know.

Actually, I'm 43.6 after 3 yellows last night =)  The rest of the group is 
50 - 53, so we do end up dealing with "fight aggro".

When we jumped down, we scooted about halfway around the wall and that 
seemed like a good place.

We -wanted- to go a little further in ( we ended up switching places with 
that other group when 4 of their members left ), but decided to save that 
for another day when we could get another tank / damage dealer to come with 
us.

>Also remember that while it's an indoor zone and

I was going to suggest that we try my lull on the non-Golem guarding the 
bridge instead of our double-root and mez method, just to see if my Lull 
actually worked better, now.  Decided not to throw a wrench in our sweet 
EXPing, though.

Have you tried using our Lull series, Dan, since the "upgrade"?  Any 
improvement?  If so, I'll go out and buy Pacify.
