Befallen, Najena, and Upper Guk (since as a necro, the froggies
won't like you anyways).

Lesser Faydark, Dagnor's Cauldron (not really very good, but open),
inside the castle in Crushbone.

Shadeweaver's thicket (beyond the mountain divider), Hollowshade Moor,
Paludal Caverns.

Good luck!

(notice I did not add LOIO to the list...that was for a reason)
