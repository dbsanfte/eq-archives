You tell 'im DT. Only educated people such as yourself should speak. Other
people should not ask questions. They should await your words of wisdom.
Whatever. Way I see you, you immediately exploded here, rather than
providing information. You flamed, rather than informed.

My first paragraph was "I haven't seen WOW yet, so i'll rely on the
experience of the readers out
there for more information, but here is my impression."

So how would I have played the game for 5 minutes again? I bought it when it
became available (ie today), and after 2 hrs I'm up to 87% of the patch. You
didn't bother to read what I'd written before flaming me.Was that ignorance?
Firian reminded you I had put a question after that point. You ignored that
and displayed something much worse than ignorance.

Wilful stupidity.

You, sir, are an arsehole, and because you content yourself with attacks
rather than information, I can't be bothered reading anything you post from
here on.
