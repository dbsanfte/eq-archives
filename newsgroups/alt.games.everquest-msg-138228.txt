Check and see if there is any particular spell area that your class
rarely uses. Most seem to have one area where you get almost no spells
of that category. In the case of wizards, it's conjuration. Almost no
spells to practice with, and the ones we do have a long casting, long
refresh, and cumbersome to practice. You might want to save a bunch of
them for an area like that, in case VI dumps a great new spell on you in
that discipline like they did for us with the familiars.
