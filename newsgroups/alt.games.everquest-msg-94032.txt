Perhaps on your server...

On my server, killing any named in ToV requires being in a guild that can
have a ToV-capable force log in within 20 minutes of the server coming up. 
There is conflict even then, as there are several guilds populated with
people with the same schedule, or lack thereof as the case may be.

If *no* named popped as soon as the server came up and instead showed up
anywhere up to seven days later, it *still* wouldn't matter cause it's the
same people that can log in within 20 minutes of the server coming up that
will then continue to sit there until the named spawn.  I did a full 7 hour
HoT armor-pharm with the top guild on the server sitting in a safe spot in
NToV waiting on spawns.  They did *nothing* for 7 hours, all 30+ of them. 
Just sat there so nobody else would come in and take the area.  They were
there when we came in, they were there when we left.  I honestly don't want
to play the game that way, as I'd rather *find* something up and give it a
shot rather than making *every* part of this game a "grind".

And yeah, some people are Asian/Euro and are off work at the right time, and
others work different shifts and so are essentially on "Korea time."  

But if your guild doesn't have enough "Korea time" and/or no-lifers on my
server, you will *not* get a shot at ToV named.  I had hoped that Luclin
would fix that, but was sadly disappointed.

>Im sure your guild is made up of the same sort of individuals as mine and
>every other guild

Surprisingly, probably not.  My guild has a reputation of being the only
guild option available for "casual" gamers that still want to hit the high
end mobs.  *Every* more powerful guild has DKP and attendance requirements
that are punitive for "casual" gamers.  I am far far off the scale on the
power-gamer side of my guild, restrained more by my timezone/job than
desire, and could probably get along fine in any of the more powerful
guilds.  But then I'd be asked to sit in ToV for 7 hours to protect a
spawn...  I still don't have any desire to play the game in that manner, and
consider that being a requirement in order to get past a certain point to be
a major design flaw of the game.

>With FCFS, some you win and some you lose... if killing the mob really means
>that much to you, then do whats required to get there first and kill it

I'm definitely not gonna quit my job in order to get a shot at Doze, though I
know some who have.  *Eventually* the first-tier guilds will move on. 
Luclin was hopefully going to give them an excuse, it didn't.
