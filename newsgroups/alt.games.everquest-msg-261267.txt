No, he means like exploring the depths of Castle Mistmoore, hanging out with
Lansa Cheroon in the hot tub.  Exploring Sol B and killing the Efretti.
Exploring Lower Guk and Grieg's End.    The people you're talking about
haven't been to Charsis, Caverns of Exile (Sol C), Cardok, Chardok Halls of
Betrayal, Cazic Thule, The Hole, Karnor's Castle, Sebilis, Velketor's
Labyrinth, Siren's Grotto, Kael, Crystal Caverns, Dragon Necropolis, Crypt
of Nadox, Torrigan's Mines, Hate's Fury, etc, etc, etc...

Sorry, I call foul.   Those arguing your point just finished defining
"casual players" as main character level 30 - 50, alts in the 20's range.
Theres no way they can have exausted all the content in the zones I've
mentioned, because they aren't high enough to survive zoning in to half of
them yet.

What you're really saying is more like 'why don't they design an expansion
for heavy players that don't want to raid, where you can get more content
than just a few zones without going through all the mandatory raid flagging
bullshit?'   (A point which, btw, I agree with.)  ... but that appears to be
*exactly* what they did here.   OoW has only one keyed zone, which is a raid
zone.   They just added a *ton* of unexplored content for level 60+'s who
don't raid.  Yet you're still complaining?
