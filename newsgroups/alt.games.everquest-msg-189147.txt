My only problem with this is that it sounds a little like the group that
took the camp was responsible for the train.  What sort of precedent is
being sent if you can create a huge train, wipe a camp, and take it over
before the other team recovers?  It's not a PvP server, so that's not really
a legit tactic.

As for not contacting the GM, there's nothing a GM will do, because camping
is a convention, not a rule.  OTOH:  I'm not sure if there is a "rule" about
intentional training, but I suspect it is discouraged at the very least.

Cheers,
Eric
