Why should he put up with juvenile and imature players? He never
claimed to be perfect. He just refuses to be guilded with rude and
crude people. From the original description there was more than one
person he would have had to ignore. It would be foolish for him to
stay in a guild if he had to ignore other members.

You seem to think that putting yourself above "crude" and "rude" is a
bad thing by your sarcastic tone. It's his $12.95 a month, and if he
wants to find a mature guild he has every right to seek one.

Nobody should EVER be ashamed to hold themselves, or the people they
associate with, to a high standard. In this particular case the
original poster is setting the bar at a maturity level above that of a
12 year old who thinks it's cool to be rude and crude. Obviously the
original poster has some self-respect.
