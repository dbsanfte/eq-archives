The thing is, warriors don't start to suck until the mid-high 50's.
Below 50, taunt works far better than above 50, even after they
supposedly fixed the ancient code that made 50+ mobs immune to taunt
back when any mob over 50 was a raid class target. At the same time,
knights really aren't that good until at least the high 50's either, as
their gear tends to be rather weak and so is their mana regen. I have
found from painful experience playing my 51 enchanter that while people
may think a paladin is better in an experience group than a warrior, in
general they aren't close. They don't have the mana to agro lock unless
they then sit and med more than the cleric between fights.

Meanwhile, by the time my extremely twinked warrior hit 58, I gave up on
him. Fighting to get and hold agro even with 40k worth of weapons just
wasn't fun. I have to agree that more than any of the tweaks that
they've done to the newbie levels, letting knights acheive the level of
agro lock they have at the high 50's and expecially 65+ has dumbed the
game down immensely.

No one wants the warrior to get anything that encroaches on another
class's turf despite the continuous encroachment on the warrior's turf
by other classes for the last three years. Odd.
