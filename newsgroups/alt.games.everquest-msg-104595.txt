RP guild, yes. Lots of guild-wide events? Not really. We do get
together on our own to RP often in little pockets, and guildwide RP
happens occasionally. But, aside from the "overall" storylines,
guildwide RP get-togethers don't happen frequently.

Eh, overally, everyone was helpful to each other. I've heard horror
stories of bad raids, and I'd say ours was very smooth.

I didn't see much of it. I was, like, the 3rd one down...in 2 hits.

datarate is 9, spell effects were off, otherhits, misses off, PC
spells me, bard songs group, NPC spells me, clip plane neutered,
/shownames 1, didn't mess with level of dtail, though. Luclin graphics
off would have required backing out. ;-p

A mix, really... The raid channel was nice for getting everyone
together and coordinated in the start without flooding Feerrott with
spam. But inside Fear, it didn't really matter.

Yeah, guildie of mine has been in 12 times and only gotten one piece.

Oh, so that's what Succor does! /jk
