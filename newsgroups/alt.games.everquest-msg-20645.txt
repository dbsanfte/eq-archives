So you are basically saying that everyone else should follow what you
have decided despite the fact that it is in direct conflict with what
the developers had in mind?  Since you, and others who lack a sense of
self worth and depend on the attention of others to validate their
existence, have a desire then the wants and needs of others, including
the games creators, should not be taken into consideration?  There are a
myriad of games on the market that allow you to project your immaturity
via silly names and even talking in faux gansta rap while you frag
people.  Why in the world would you need to turn EQ into another such
place?  If you have a desire to play a roleplaying game, then by all
means play EQ.  If you have a desire to express your individuality via
silly names and d00dish behavior please consider not playing EQ.  If
after consideration you chose to play EQ anyway, then by all means
expect a great resistance to your efforts to reduce EQ to such a level
that those who play the game as intended are no longer able to do so.
