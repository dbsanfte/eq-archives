I'm not bothering with the rest of this post. Go ahead and parade
around and say you won all you want, I don't give a rat's ass. It's
not worth my time trying to justify myself to a snot-nosed brat like
yourself. 

Just wanted to point out one thing here: The person I called a whiner
was NOT the OP on this thread. It was someone who replied to the OP.
Get your facts straight if you're going to flame me. kk thx la~
