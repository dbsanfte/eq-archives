That'd do it sure but most people who are color blind (correct me if I
am wrong) don't see in black and white they just have confusion
between two colors (think red/green is the most common problem - no
idea how they deal with trafic lights!).  If you let them modify the
color of the con msgs to make green ones come out, say, purple then
that'd fix the problem for them.
