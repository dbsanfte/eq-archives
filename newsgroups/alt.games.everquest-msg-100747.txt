Any chance anyone has a profile that they'd be willing to share? (for the 
n50) Maybe seeing someone else's profile will give me some ideas...

I've got it set-up to use keys 01-04 to select hotbanks.
Key 05 is a RED shift
Key's 06-10 are Number keys 1-5
dpad is /c, esc, F1, and Q(attack).
REDdpad is I, F9(X4), F9(X1), NumLock

I've not figured out a use for the throttle thingy.
I havn't yet tried to get it working with a casting class yet.
There doesn't seem to be enough buttons for the 8 spell slots.

It'd be nice to be able to use the n50 to backup, while fighting but I've 
not figured that out. It appears that the dpad can only be used for 
movement in the non-shifted mode.??

www.gameclubcentral.com has an area where profiles can be up/downloaded.
I'll upload what I've got once I clean it up a bit, and figure out some 
uses for the "empty" keys.

Thanks !
