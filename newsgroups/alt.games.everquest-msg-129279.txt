Howdy all,

  I don't usually go LD, but it does occasionally happen, and usually at the
most inopportune time (if there really *IS* an opportune time to compare it
to.
  Anyway, my problem is the local electric company has had occasional
blackouts this summer.  My question is, if I get a UPS I will have some
backup to at least shut down safely, but does a cable internet connection
work like phones do in power outages?  Of course I realize the modem would
have to be in the UPS, but is the *connection* still there, for example,
being able to use your phone with no power to the rest of your house?

TIA,
SEAN....<----lost power while being ML.  Thankfully was grouped with friends
who won't be angry about a much delayed /split.
