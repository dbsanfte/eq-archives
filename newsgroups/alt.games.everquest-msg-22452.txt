I havent got anywhere near the advancement you have, but have been
considering the inevitability of what you say.  I had more or less 3
ideas

Control the amount of time I play and try to get interested in RL (I'm
serious)

Roleplay more, try to develop real 'character' of character

Talk to people online and in guild as the social side of things is one
of the most interesting to me, hack 'n' slash just doesnt do it, I can
do that without paying for online time.

Travel, created a druid first for this, but am doing it mostly with a
DEF Necro at level 25 now, which makes it more interesting as I need to
be careful.

I was recently invited to become a guild officer and this makes it more
interesting as I can spend some time encouraginf people in the guild and
organising raids (something I havent done yet though) and increases the
social contact side.

Learn to count as that's 4 ;)

Regards,

S.
