Your call.  Point remains we are getting ever further from the
certainty that Salk's survival would have done more good for society.
Not that that was ever the point.

I sense another contrived hypothetical looming.  How often do children
die as a result of the death of one parent?  And for that matter, what
about the yet-to-be children of the ones you are neglecting to save?
We are suddenly awash in the potential of future generations.  There's
two of them and one of you.  Odds are good they'll have more to
contribute from their progeny.

I see.  So let me unceremoniously do to you what you have with an
equal lack of ceremony done to poor Mr. Salk and plonk you down in a
burning building with the two hapless children (who are no doubt by
now having grave misgivings about the whole affair).

A few minutes earlier, whilst experimenting to see if a blowtorch
makes a good curtain-cleaning device, you suddenly came up with the
plans for a perpertual motion oven mitt.  Egad, you think, the world
*must* hear of this!

You notice the fire.  A section of the floor, on cue, begins to cave
downwards.  Waving goodbye to the children and shouting, ""Tis a far,
far better thing I do..." you leap across the gap and speed outside,
secure in the knowledge that the world will be a better place for your
survival.

The point is that anyone can *rationalize* why it is more important
for them to survive.  We are all of us extremely good at that.  And
that is your point, you'll say.  To which I reply

Hooey.

There is a great deal more to the equation of human morality than an
instinct for self-preservation.  If you were correct, soldiers would
never stay in a line of battle but would flee at the first sign of
danger.  A mother would never make sure her child has enough to eat
before she herself has.  A man would never donate one of his kidneys
so that his brother might live.

Firemen would never go to put out fires.  Rescue workers would never
risk their lives to save others.  Policemen would never put themselves
in harm's way to keep civilians from harm.

The world would indeed be a very chilling place and I am glad that you
are so utterly wrong on this point.

No, I assume equality.

So you meet a total stranger and immediately assume your importance
and value is superior to his?

Oh jeez, avoid the charged words please.  The thread is already
tending towards a discussion of who could have won WWII.  If it
degenerates into liberal vs. conservative, I'm bailing.

It's much more interesting discussing the nature of evil.

Well, considering the fact that he's dead, I don't think he's all
a-twitter to hear my opinion, no.  

But honestly, Lokari, do you really believe this or are you just
debating?  You really sincerely believe Stalin did no evil?  I'm not
interested in what you think *he* thought, I'm interested in what
*you* think.  And if you think he did do evil, how was it evil?  If it
wasn't, why not?
