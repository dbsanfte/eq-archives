Unfortunately in the case of the Iksars, as I understand it, all
non-Iksars start off with very bad faction (kos) with most Iksar
factions and it can be even worse (numerically) for certain other
Iksar factions. If you are off the wrong religon, it is (numerically)
even worse. So in getting to dubious so other (faster?) factioning
quests can be done [wrt Iksars in Cabilis] a player might reach a
point of no further increases due to having max adjustment to say
Legion of Cabilis, while still being kos to other factions. I don't
understand if the inability to get further faction with say a trooper
on LoC faction would prevent further faction changes with other
factions that also got affected at turnin.

You are certainly correct that for most faction circumstances a 2000
limit is not really limiting.
