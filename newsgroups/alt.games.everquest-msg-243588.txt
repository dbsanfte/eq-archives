It does qualify. All depends on where you want to invest your time.
Even then.. time is money. Investment does not necessarily need a
monetary indicator. In the case of a child you are strengthening a
bond, entertaining both, and investing the time to make it happen. Its
such a constrained view of the term to only use it only when you
happen to purchase something with real life money. That is but one
definition.
