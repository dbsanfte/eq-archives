I have a GeForce 3 Pure and I went to the Grey for the first time last week.
As long as I kept the sky off my screen I had no slow down at all. But if I
had to look up for anything then I would get pretty bad slow down.  I have
this GeForce 3 in a Athlon XP 1900+ with 768 2100 DDR and a 60gig 100
7200RPM HD.  An a SB Audigy Gamer.  I have the same problem all over SoL and
in the Bazaar.  Not sure if I have some setting wrong but it makes it so I
really don't like playing on the moon much.
