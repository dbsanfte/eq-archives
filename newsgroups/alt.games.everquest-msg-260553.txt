My personal favourite was this one LOL
Direct quote below

"Professional Training
Mad at somebody?  Mad at a whole group?  Mad at an entire guild?  Well, try
counting to ten.  Take a deep breath.  Drink a glass of water.  Still angry?
TRAIN EM using our train-making exploit!  Any race/class can do this, all
you need is the help of a level 14+ cleric, and you can train better than a
monk with Feign Death!"

Ever wonder why you'd need that 14plus cleric?  For rezzing your butt
afterwards.  LOL
