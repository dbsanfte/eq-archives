    I always try and take into account travel time, and any other associated
prep downtime (like getting rebound, if needed) before leaving wherever I
am. One monk in a Velk's group with us got disgusted when he couldn't
chain-pull from crowding, and left to go to Chardok. By the time he found a
port over, got to Chardok, and got a pickup group in Chardok, we'd not only
made a fair chunk of XP but the zone had cleared out a bit. Always think big
picture. It can be frustrating when you're looking for spawns and you see
folks sitting on damn-near every spider spawn point on the lower few levels,
though.

    You can fit that many people into Velk's without even having anyone at
spiders. Upper Dog camp, Lower Dog camp, and the Broodmother all comfortably
hold a full group. Usually the spider areas are good until you get more than
three full groups there (two if you can't live without chain 'n park
pulling).

    Sounds consistent with me doing pretty much all of 59 in one catass
weekend.

    No, suicidal is the 59 SK on our server who solos spiders by kiting
them. He has a set pattern he runs through the first level, after finding a
spider and darkness/DoTting the hell out of it. If he gets too far ahead he
sits and meds, as DoTs drop he reapplies, and he'll run 'em around until
they get down to 50% or so. Uses his prenerf Circlet to avoid adds. Seems
nutty, but it works for him I guess.
