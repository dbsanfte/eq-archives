What I don't understand is the "random" nature of the effect. While this 
may work for saving mana (saved mana is saved mana, after all), effects 
like reduced casting time or increased range don't appear to me to be of 
any use if you can't actually strategize around them. Say, when I quad-
kite, I fire off my AE nuke at a certain point that takes into account its 
range and how long it takes to cast, and how fast the mobs are moving. The 
fact that about half the time the range may be larger or the casting time 
shorter is of zero use to me, because I have to tailor my tactics to the 
worst case (no focus items firing at all).
