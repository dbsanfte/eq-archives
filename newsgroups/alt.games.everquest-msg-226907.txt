I made sure to turn autosplit off.  I didn't cherish the role of ML, but 
went ahead and did it so we could get the adventure going....didn't seem 
like anyone else wanted the job.  (The second group, that had a mixed 
split of plat, gold, silver and copper, was 5 casters and a pally, so 
there wasn't much difference in ML's, as the pally had two full-time jobs 
to do :) )

If nothing else, turning off autosplit just makes it easier to get the 
right amount to split to the group.  Otherwise, you gotta make sure to 
note what you have before selling and do the math to figure out the split 
amount....too much effort for me.

If I have a choice in future, I'll NOT be ML.  Otherwise, I will do it 
grudginly (SP?).
