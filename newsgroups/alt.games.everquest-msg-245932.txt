I had a bright idea earlier tonight that maybe I could stop having zones 
show up with half the ground missing if I cleaned out my texture cache 
files.  So I went into options and turned caching off.  Then I logged in 
and went to PoK... And locked up just like everyone's been complaining 
about for a couple weeks now.  Logged back in, locked up again.  So I 
turned caching back on, logged in... no lockup...

So I'm curious.  Among those of you with severe PoK lockups, how many have 
caching turned on?
