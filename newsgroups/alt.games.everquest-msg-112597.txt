It's not only moot, is negative, because he has to sit on his ass for 
longer, to fill up the bigger mana pool, only to lose all that extra mana 
when he removes the wisdom gear.

As for the original question, yes, I switch gear depending on the 
situation. For example, I will swap out my Bone-handled Scimitar for a 
fishing pole when I want to do some fishing. :) (actually, I also swap 
out mana gear for Wisdom gear when fishing or doing tradeskills, to help 
the chances of a skill-up).
