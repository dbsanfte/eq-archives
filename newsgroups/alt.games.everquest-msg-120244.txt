Have you installed any other memory resident programs in the interim?

Reason I ask is because you may have decreased the amount of RAM available
if there is something else memory resident like firewall or ICQ. There is
also a chance you have some kind of rogue program left behind. Just as a for
instance, I shut down UO and <ctrl><alt><delete> to task manager and see
their translation server is still up and running, using a ton of memory and
processor time.

It would be easier to guess if you had listed specs. I would say 500 megs of
RAM is a good working minimum. If you have that much, then go to task
manager and see what is taking up processor time. With just an active
connection to the internet you should have somewhere between 85% and 95% of
your processor time in System Idle Process. If you have any big hitters in
there without anything actively running, you have a problem.

Things like killing sound should help more then anything else.
