The chatserver is based outside the game for connection purposes and more or
less only uses the gameengine as a display function.
(Yes i know it is a little more complicated then that but i am simplifying)
and therefore uses it's own set of connections and ports to connect over.
It has been known that some firewalls and NAT's have a problem with
chatchannels and might need some further tweakage, like opening up more
ports or upgrading the NAT to take care of the extra traffic in a better
way.
I had a friend who could not use chatchannels at all until he upgraded
because he was getting the chatserver messages sent to ANOTHER computer then
the one he was playhing on by the NAT :)

ps. NAT = Network Adress Translator ie. a program or function on a router
that makes sharing a connection between computers in a network possible.
