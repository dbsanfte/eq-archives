Hey all i'm gonna say is I finally took my level 18 Bard to the
frontier with friends. We were camping bugs and I stood up to see
someone running towards us. I shouted "inc behind" and my friend stood
up only to be cut down by a High level briton.  My other friend was
next and me, having never been to the frontier, didn't have a frontier
hotbar made up so I was juggling between my solo, group and song
hotbars and died. Even as I released I got a tell " Hey what killed
you and where was it?" from a total stranger. It was a member of
Defiant, a high level guild on my server. I gave them as much details
as I could and ran back to the frontier only to see them (at least 8
of them) swarm over and route a British group that the enemy tank had
come from.  I died once more trying to disrupt enemy casts when I got
meleed to death but to me it was great because I had stopped an enemy
caster from getting a cast off. I had helped in the enemy route. I
died for helping but I didn;t lose anything to death so no harm no
foul. 
End result, 2 deaths for me, no realm points accumulated, ganked by
high level enemies, and yet I had a blast.
