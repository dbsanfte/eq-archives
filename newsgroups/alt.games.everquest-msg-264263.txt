Hell, as a cleric I eat my death a fair amount and I can rez 
myself - if I have run back with kei and assorted buffs from POK, 
I would rather have the buffs than 10% xp. I can get the xp back, 
and being buffed and ready to go gets the xp back faster, because 
i rarely ever manage to get a group with a chanter=(. Of course, 
I do solo on light blues, and i would rather get directly back to 
killing instead of rezzing and then having to schlep back and 
forth getting rebuffed.
