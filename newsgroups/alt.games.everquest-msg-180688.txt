This choice is no longer required.  But since the OP mentioned RPing
it would make sense to consider in-game "religion" in selecting
characters (a DE Inny Cleric doesn't really mesh with any follower of
either of the Marrs, Karana, or Tunare for instance).

The only race with a required "religion" is Iksar (Cazic-Thule).
Since any other race can be agnostic and most (all?) have multiple
diety choices (depending on class, of course), it's quite possible
to RP a group that has both "good" and "evil" races in it.  If you
don't care about the RP aspect then you are no more restricted on
FV than any other server (a chat channel gives an easy temporary
workaround for the language barrier, which has been nerfed to be
much less of a pita than it was when FV opened anyways).

If you want an Ogre for MT in a "good" or "neutral" party there are a
variety of RP stories you could invent to justify it, depending on the
Ogre's "religion".

You can take issue with this on more than one level.  The first and
most obvious objection is that Manaburn requires L59 and a fair bit
of AA.
