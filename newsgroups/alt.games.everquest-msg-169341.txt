Aye, the only charged loot I've really used is a Larrican's mask; sense normal
invis potions don't stack, its nice to have a mask on me for normal invis uses,
then I can keep a potion in the box for instant refresh if it starts to fade
out.

This is a common drop cheap to buy item though, anything harder to get I'd end
up waiting for the perfect moment and never using it at all.

Charges are an interesting idea, but having items not be rechargable means they
are pretty much worthless as far as the charge effect goes, most of the time.
