"Because of our extensively redesigned game engine, existing EverQuest
characters cannot be transferred to EverQuest II."

That's total Bullshit.  SOE programmers can do anything(well, almost) they
want. If they wanted to give us close to what we had in EQ1  (similar
equipment, etc.. they could)

They just don't want to give anything for "free".
