Same.. but judging by some of the loot that drops in there.. I think i need
to pay a visit soon heh.

Not sure I have the patience to wait for "ideal" groups tho.. i.e warrior,
cleric, enchanter...  the best thing about getting my second computer, was I
never needed to sit LFG again... now I can do most places all by myself (I
can tripple bot a 60monk, 60cleric and 60 shaman heh)
