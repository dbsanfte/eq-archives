You get a sense of accomplishment from driving a Pinto?

I like toys.  In real life and in game.  Both require me sacrificing some
"freedom" to acquire, and yes I do indeed get a sense of accomplishment from
both.

Yes, in fact, it is one of the best "solo" businesses I can come up with. 
Assuming no major amount of luck (or talent, which one is lucky to have),
there isn't much you can do in this world without having a boss and still be
considered successful.  I'd be glad to check out your examples of better
solo businesses.  Hell, I don't like my job that much.  Feel free and tell
me how to get rich without having a boss.   =)

I can think of all sorts of businesses that can make one wealthy that one
can start solo, and promptly start hiring employees at the first stage of
success.  The analogy of moving from solo to grouping to raiding just seems
that much more apt in such a case.  =)
