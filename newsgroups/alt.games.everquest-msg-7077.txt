*** COMMENTARY ALERT ***

Y'know, I've been around Usenet for a long, long time.  This is without a
doubt the best ng I've ever subscribed to as far as providing great answers
to legitimate, OT posts.  Oh sure, there are flames and flamers, and the
whole troll thing of the past couple of months ... but by and large even the
trolls receive good answers when they take the time to submit valid
questions.

/em applauds the a.g.e community.  Well done!  :-)
