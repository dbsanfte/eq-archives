Melody won't eliminate twisting unfortunately, and a good bard will 
still need to twist manually if he wants to be effective.

Some songs fizzle/resist and you just keeping going until you come back 
around. Others you stop and redo that song until it lands. I'll let 
haste wear off, or miss a chant... but in some situations slow/snare 
*must* land, or MR *must* be refreshed...etc.

Its definately eliminated downtime twisting, which is a good thing. 
Although they've mostly nerfed the point out of most downtime twisting 
anyway.

I'm disgusted by the content of many of the comments on the thread 
though. Fear of BardBots runs rampant... people who think a bardbot on 
autofollow can accomplish anything near what a played bard can do 
deserves a good kick in the head.

Sadly, perhaps too many bards out there *think* their role IS to follow 
the cleric around twisting a static melody.
