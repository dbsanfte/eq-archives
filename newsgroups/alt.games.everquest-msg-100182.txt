He is partly right. For 1 handed weapons, damage bonus is only affected by the
level you are. It is (level - 25)/3. Strength, dexterity, and attack rating have no
affect in the damage bonus of 1 handed weapons.

With 2-handed weapons, it is affected by the delay range and the level. The base is
believed to be (level - 25)/3 +1 for 2-handed weapons with a delay less then 28. It
is something else for delays 29-40 and again something else for delays 40+.

And I play a ranger as well as a rogue.
