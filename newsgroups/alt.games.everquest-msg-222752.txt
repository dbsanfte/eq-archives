I don't know for sure.  Whether or not it's suicide depends on your mindset
going into an adventure.

If your objective is to complete the mission, then it may well be suicide to
go in with three if the adventures are optimized for a group of six.

However, two friends of mine and I regularly go into a LDoN dungeon just for
the XP .. to hell with the mission.  Nice pulls, rooms stay clear for
medding/afk (should a wife or child need something), no competition for
spawns, two hours and it's done.  When you go into it with that as your
plan, what this means for us is that we're no longer in a situation where
one of us is required to two-box just to get in the door.
