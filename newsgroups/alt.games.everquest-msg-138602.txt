She wanders in Shar-Vahl [sp] and has a bit of a faction hit.  I
cannot speak for new models but on old race combos with no 'robe'
graphic it shows up as a crappy tunic.  Wait until she wanders away
from her father and other high level NPCs and smack her down.  She is
part of a newbie quest where you have to escort her home I believe.

Identify says something like "You killed a child to get this" :/
