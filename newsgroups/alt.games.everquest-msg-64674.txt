Don't worry...I do remember what the other guy was saying with needing to
have exact same type of memory....yes that is true.....for SIMM memory, you
know, the old 72-pin 60ns/70ns/slower RAM we all used to use....and even
then he missed something.  Only the older boards needed that, and even then
most would let you run seperate types, but they did have to be paired.  8MB,
8MB, 4MB, 4MB.

I'm glad they fixed that problem.
