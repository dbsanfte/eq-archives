I honestly don't think starting stats matter much at all for a Bard.
Myself I would look at STA and DEX (dex does seem to help missed
notes a bit, but that could be imagination).  Also STR is good so
you can carry stuff until you get lower weight armour and STR stat
increasing stuff.  CHA seems to make no difference that I can tell
other than on prices (faction effects price more it seems).

I never make night-blind characters any more.  My first and only was
my Erudin Necro and he gets a spell to handel that problem early in
life.  I would  hate to have to twist in another song just to be
able to see decently myself.  My fingers get to smoking on the
keyboard without that head-ache.  My only break is between fights
with mana song and when I run from A to B, at all other times it is
1-2-2-3-3-1-1-2-2-3-3 and maybe a 4 twisted in every now and again
to zing the tanks or myself if fights are extended.  I won't even
mention instrument juggling and song twisting together.  I do this
rarely because so many songs don't get enough of a boost to
compensate me not having me weapons equiped (IMO).

Have fun.
