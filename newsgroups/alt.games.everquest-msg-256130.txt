The druid pet spell is available mid-40s, and while not completely useless,
is the weakest summoned pet in the game by quite a bit.  However, after the
initial cast, it's still like having a mana-free dot, so if you're trying to
maximize DPS, it doesn't hurt, especially with a druid pet buff on it.

Charm, on the other hand, can be quite useful, if you know what you're
doing.  Of course, druid charm only works on animals, and you never know how
long it will last, but some of the animals you can charm (PoN ravens or
stalkers, PoD swamp rats, etc), once properly buffed can tear through other
mobs in the area pretty quickly.  So for druids in their late 40s to
mid/late 50s, solo charm-kiting is one of the fastest ways to get exp (even
after the pet damage/exp nerf).
Of course, charming isn't nearly as useful at low levels, but it's a good
time to practice, since these low-level mobs won't kill you in a matter of
seconds like the charmable planes mobs will.  And if you pair up with
someone that can lower a mobs resistance, the charm tents to last much
longer (druids can use Glamour of Tunare to do it, but again, not until
higher levels)
