There are four separate slots when you hand an item to the NPC.   If you're
giving him four of something, make sure you put one in each slot.   Don't
just hand him a stack of 4 thats all in one slot.

Some quests will accept a stack of 4 items as 4 separate turn ins others
will count a stack as 1 turn in.   But they all accept one at a time, so
best to do that to be safe.
