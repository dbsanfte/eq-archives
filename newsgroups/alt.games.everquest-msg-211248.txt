It will be a long time before I can look at that arguement from personal
experience.  From the standpoint of a 65 cleric, 57 bard, and 51 shaman, I can
say that generally speaking earth pets are frowned on at any level by people who
don't know the whys and wherefores of picking one pet over another (such as that
there simply -is- no 51 air pet like it or not); I've many times heard and even
made the arguement that the group would rather see no pet at all than that
damned rooter.

Soloing and chaining, well, its illogical at my low level, where reclaiming gets
me very little mana back and summoning a pet is a big chunk of my mana pool; I
can see where as the level and HP of the pet goes up far faster than the summon
cost, at high levels its a much more sensible practice.  And of course, that
having the mob rooted so I can get the summon off would be a big help.  Still
seems like a stunt, though, and I did say that earth pets do have their place
("has its tactical uses")

I have that now, even on red mobs I can do over 20% in one shot.  I imagine this
changes as we level up, after all, far be it from SOE to train us correctly in
the low levels:)

Well by 30 SOW is fairly affordable to have all the time via SOW potion... but
again, it sounds like a stunt, I don't think I'll be able to level up on SG's
they are just too rare a pop.  Fun to take one down, but sort of like me having
bow kited a red to me grizzly bear to death once with a 10 ranger; yes its
doable but no, its no way to run a railroad.

The flaw with this reasoning is that root breaks frequently when the mob gets
nuked, and so the mob seesaws back and forth randomly between prox aggro and
taunt aggro.  My shaman and cleric both used root to create prox aggro so they
could sponge for rogues and rangers, being better suited to taking damage and
increasing the DPS of the tanks by letting them take the hind end of the mob...
but to do it you need to be able to cast it on demand (ie whenever it breaks)
and not break it (meaning the mage/wizard have to not nuke).  Lacking a /pet
cast root NOW command, or a /pet dammit stop nuking command, you really can't
predict whats going to be in effect at any given moment.  Is it possible to work
around that, and to make good use of the root proc?  Sure it is... but it means
giving up the normal workings of a normal group in favor of the (slightly)
exotic world of prox aggro.

I'll probably have to do the same... but at 26 I'm very happy to have three
other choices available to me finally

I'm currently farming the "an alligator" spawn in Feerrot for the other items,
but they aren't being particularly generous.  Likewise, I didn't actually pick
the water focus, its just the only part thats dropped so far.  All the other
pieces of the focus items are trivially difficult to pick up, its just a
question of getting the darn magician/alligator drops to happen.

I'm nervous about going after the magicians in Najena, utterly lacking in CC as
I am, crowds of mobs make me nervous solo; as long as they all get on my pet I'm
usually fine (and love DS when that happens) but if even one peels off onto me I
have trouble getting it back onto my pet, and I really can't tank long at all,
even light blue mobs make a fine paste out of me before my pet manages to finish
off what he's working on.  This may of course be a matter of me needing more
skill as a player.

ALso, aren't the magicians down there green to me by now?  If so, the fact that
I'm on Firiona Vie server would mean that they'd be useless as a source of the
drops, Trivial Loot Code would deny me the pieces.  I can work around that by
getting someone to come with me and going it in raid mode... but the drop rate
would have to be fantastic for me to waste my and someone else's time doing that
instead of exp camping gators (and lots and lots of Tar Ew) in Feerrot instead.
