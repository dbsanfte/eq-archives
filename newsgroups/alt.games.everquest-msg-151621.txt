If he griefs you silently, unless a GM is already there, there's probably
nothing they can do.  HOWEVER, even if it's silent, the petition will get
this guy's name into the guide/gm's heads.

/report AND /petition any time he violates TOS publicly (cursing, etc).  He
won't be suspended due to cursing once...but see my previous paragraph.

I have a feeling you guys aren't ignoring him.  I have a feeling you guys
are feeding the troll.

I go on to have the feeling that if you say NOTHING to him...and talk your
guildies into doing the same thing (good luck!), he will go away.  Don't
brag about petitioning, just do it.  Don't tell him.

He wants to lose his account and piss you off.  So, help him lose his
account but don't let him see he's succeeding in his secondary goal.
