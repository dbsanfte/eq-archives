The concept sounds very good however actually playing on the FV server is a
different thing.  I personally think this server shows how lacking of actual
Role Playing material EQ is.  I played the regular servers for a year before
I tried the FV server.  I only stayed a week.  It is VERY difficult to get
basic things done on the FV server.  If you have a group of Real Life
friends who play EQ then FV may be doable.  If you have a partner to team
with on a regular basis then then FV is doable.  But if you are going to try
and play it and think finding a group will be easy, I think you will be in
for a sad awakening.

FV is a great place for a husband and wife or two good friends to play on.
One could start a Cleric or Shaman while the other could start a Warrior or
Monk.  Or any of the other two person teams.  You two could be the same race
and work together from day one.  That would be cool.
