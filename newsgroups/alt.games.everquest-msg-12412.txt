He "wanted" 1400pp and you mentioned something that would leave us to
believe you arent even level 20.  How much are Ghoulbanes actually going
to -be- by the time you can really take advantage of its effect among other
things?

What are you using on your chest now?  You are obviously a Paladin, so your
damage output isnt that great let alone having damage inflicted upon you.  I
fear you might have been mislead in a way.

Tough to say though, since Im going by what they are on my server, which is
1kpp.

Take care.
