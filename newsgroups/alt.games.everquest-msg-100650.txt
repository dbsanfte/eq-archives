I'd say they both have something to do with it. Based on what they're
willing to reveal about their server architecture, it takes one LINUX/UNIX
box for each three zones, plus at least one box for login/character storage.
That is PER World Server(There are 30+ now, yeah?). I'm not sure about the
total number of zones in the game, but I'm thinking that with Luclin active
it's now over 100 zones. Divide that by 3, then multiply it by however many
World Servers exist, and that's a hella bunch of hardware. Make sure you
allow for spare hard drives, cards, motherboards, processors, switches,
routers, cabling(CAT5 and Fiber, probly)etc. that need to be kept on hand to
minimize downtime in case of failure(Yes, it has happened, as both I and
some of the other vets in this game will recall).

Then, add to that the cost of bandwidth to keep everyone connected with
maximum reliability and redundancy on their end. They don't run these
servers on analog voice lines, and T-1 circuits are not cheap, and I'm
guessing they probably have more than one dedicated T-3 coming into their
data center(s) (That's 20-some T-1's to every T-3). Add that up at whatever
Pacific Bell's going monthly rates are for that hellacious kind of pipe, and
you'll probably find that bandwidth costs them far more than all that
hardware, combined, on a montly basis.

Finally, add to that whatever it costs them to have enough network geeks on
their payroll to keep that monster running smooth 24/7. It's no small task,
and most certified and exerienced network techs who know their stuff won't
work for 8 bucks an hour and free EQ accounts. Entry-Level positions in this
field run 30-40K a year, depending on the region. I'm guessing that most of
their network guys are not entry-level techs.


All of that notwithstanding, Mythic has gotten by charging 12.95 a month
with minimal outcry for DAoC since day 1. No solid business reason why Sony
shouldn't then, and I think you'll see Microsoft follow suit before too
long.
