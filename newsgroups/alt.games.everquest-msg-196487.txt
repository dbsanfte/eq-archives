More and more I am hearing about Casino Scams. Happened to a guild
friend. Lost 500pp on a bet he won. What's funnier is that it was the
second time he lost. /bonk......

You place the bet, you win and he goes LD. Some have taken to no pay
until you lose, so you play you lose a couple of times, you win one
and the guy goes LD. No matter what if the guy doesn't wanna pay his
ISP can suddenly go dead!

Most games are "sucker bets".

A good game is double your money games have you roll 100, above 50
wins. that means up 50 loses. That is more than 50%, so the house,
makes 1% by the law of averages.

Many have more than 60 wins, makeing the house 10%. Triple your money
if you roll over 80. That means you will win one in five times, and
the house gains 13%

I wish Sony would BAN the practice, these guys spam zones with
repeated OOC and shouts, put themselves in the most annoying places,
and is rife with abuse.
