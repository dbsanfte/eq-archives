Best thing to do is just use your lowest level root to keep it separated from
the group you are killing.  You should not have to root it more than once,
maybe twice to keep it away from your group.  You dont want to waste
mana on it while you are trying to finish a quad.

And if you can see it ahead of time to cast harmony on it then why did you
get close enough to add it in the first place?
