Yeah no specific PH, but right where you said.  The 6 hours I was there, it
was either Xalgoz or a skelly.  When I first broke the room, that was the
last guy to be pulled, so as the room was popping he would be the last spot
to spawn.  This was nice as the room would be cleared by the time Xalgoz/PH
popped.
