Hey!  Nice context removal there!  Why let anybody else know that
my post was in response to a demand that I "prove" that Clerics
can outdamage Paladins.  A Warrior outdamages a Paladin, like vs. like,
all day every day.  So, try to follow along here, if Cleric outdamages
Warrior and Warrior outdamages Paladin, guess what?  Cleric outdamages
Paladin.

And if I were to fight something tougher than an Orc Pawn?

The tests I was referring to involved spiders in Velks, blue to the
combatants.  Trying to figure out how it's a "scam", are you trying
to tell us that your SK's advantage in damage output over a Paladin
is a "scam" since it's spell reliant?  Is a Rangers edge over a
Warrior a scam since it too is spell reliant?  The Cleric's melee
depends on a summoned hammmer (spell) which does extra magical
damage (spell-effect)... so what?  That seems less of a scam than
<any> melee's total reliance on outside assistance (who made all those
wonderful magic weapons we use, eh?).

You forgot quoting out of context.  And "comparing apples to oranges".
Not to mention your utterly misleading little Furor "statistic".
Overall I'd have to give your post about a 9.0 LDLAS ("lies, damned
lies, and statistics") rating (would have given you only a 6.5, but
the chutzpah of your unattributed Twain quote was quite a boost).
