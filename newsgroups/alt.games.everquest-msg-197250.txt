I have *enough* knowledge to offer an opinion on the subject. The fact 
that I've never gone through the trials doesn't make my opinion 
automatically wrong, just like your *having* been through it doen't make 
yours automatically right.

No I'm not. I'm simply defending my opinion that the trials should not be 
taken out.

Again with the elitist "you haven't been there" approach. That just 
doesn't mean *nearly* as much as you claim. I know what it's all about. I 
have read several detailed accounts on this and other forums about it. 
I'd say I am qualified to offer a valid opinion.

If they were decent guild members, guilt trips would certainly not be 
necessary. Simply get other tanks flagged so that they can level up more, 
making them suitable tanks for the trials. Additionally, if you only have 
one tank capable of tanking the executioner, I might recommend a 
recruiting drive. As I stated earlier, I think it is a good thing to 
require a concerted guild approach to gaining access to the higher 
content.

Now your just grandstanding. No place did I say anything of the sort. Do 
you not know any players of higher level than those in your guild? So, 
let me get this straight. Your guild only has one tank capable of tanking 
the executioner and no friends outside the guild of appropriate level? I 
don't think it's a stretch to see where maybe the game isn't the problem 
here.

So the *same* group has to help more than just *one* person through. Duh. 
Of *course* not every person you help through will be a suitable 
substitute for that uber tank. However, the more people you *do* get 
through, the more tanks you will have.

Sorry. People who would get upset if I didn't dedicate over half my time 
to this effort don't fall into the category of those I consider my

Nobody is forcing anyone to do *anything*. If they want to advance, they 
do what is necessary. If I want to level, I kill shit. There is no way 
around that. At these higher levels there is simply a more difficult 
requirement, and that is a fitting thing. It needs some fixing, to be 
sure, but it is a good part of the overall storyline and progression of 
the game.

There is no reason it shouldn't, unless maybe your guild just lacks the 
necessary components in the first place.
