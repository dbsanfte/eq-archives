Are you strafing when you're killed?  This happens to me too,
generally when I'm strafe-crawling towards the zone.  I'd guess the
glitch is due to strafing speed being fixed when you fall over rather
than stopped.  Fortunately, the movement is only client-side - when
you come back for your body, it should be where you fell over, not
over the hills and far away.
