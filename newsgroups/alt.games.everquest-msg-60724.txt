Isn't this stuff you should ask the guild leaders before you decide to
join?  Generally, a guild that expects people to be at the beck and
call of the guild is going to be pretty easy to spot, and they
probably will have hard feelings if you join and then leave.  As to
the old gear issue, why is this such a hot topic?  I've never had
anything on me that was so good that I had to keep it when I got an
upgrade, and it's just a pain to try and sell stuff.  I dropped a
bunch of odds and ends on my twinks, thinking I'd use them as auction
mules, but just can't be bothered.  If I were looking for a new guild
(which I can't imagine ever doing, if I'm not having fun in my guild
it means I've lost interest in the game), one thing I would look for
would be a guild with a designated auction whore.  At the high end I
really don't have any use for plat other than upgrading to all
tinkerers bags and donating to the guild anyway, so I would MUCH
prefer just to dump all the 1-5kpp items on someone who would sell
them for the guild.   That being said, unless it is a really good
item, or something that was obviously awarded in a guild event, and
you get the upgrade in a guild event, there probably won't be a lot of
pressure to pass it down.
Of course I am receiving my imbrued granite spaulders from a guildie,
but only because he's retiring his warrior to PL a beastmaster.
