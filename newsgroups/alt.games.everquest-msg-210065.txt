Were the Velious cities included in the City Exp nerf? Was hunting and P/L
in SS yesterday and things seemed particularly slow although this could have
been my imagination as my work rate was not proportinate to my kill rate
given all the casters I was having to deal with. I don't particularly want
to waste time hunting giants in KD if their exp is modified in a negative
way.

Also, does anyone know where I can find some Gargoyle Guardians in SS. There
are 2 by the pool room but that is all I know of and I haven't found and
more on track around that area? Gargoyle Guardians seem to be the only mobs
that still drop the Guardian armour with the original guardian mobs now
gone? My faction in SS is rock bottom so any exploring means fighting my way
thru.
