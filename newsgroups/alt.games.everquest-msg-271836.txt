Maybe,I was unclear in my above posts,I try again.  :)
Point is that the situation has changed,my 1.3 Ghz mashine fulfills
all my other needs for a computer,like Video and music recording.
This was not possible with the predecessor(Celeron 333),even 
opening programms was slow,so I had a good reason to update,
now the only reason left would be EQ2 and that is what I would call
unreasonable.
And to the guys who argue there are other games which have high
system requirements,most MMORPGers do not have much need
for other games,and to buy a new mashine for the occasional other
game would be even more unreasonable.
