I play in first person exclusively (except when buff-whoring in PoK)
for simple reason that it's more realistic.
I know, "realistic" in a computer game is not exactly logical.

But in RL I have to actually turn around to see what's behind me, so I
should have to do it in the game too.  Of course I can just turn my
head in RL, not stand up and rotate my entire body but....

And of course I have died because of it but hey, it's a game and
sometimes dying is good for a story or two.
