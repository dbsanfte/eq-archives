Yup. He's close to where you do the 2nd jump down. I _think_ you can
avoid him if you hang a right as soon as you get to that open area
with the two bridges where he spawns. Seems like he spawns at the
bridge that's straight ahead of you when you come down the corridor
but you can jump off of the bridge that's to your right.
