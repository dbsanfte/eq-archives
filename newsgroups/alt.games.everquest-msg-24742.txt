"""They don't do it because they want to farm greens for cheap junk"""

No offense, but were you reading the same post I was?

"""Then the named orc popped and he proceeded to interfere in our
fight in such a way that he not only stole the kill, but started a
series of events that got our druid killed.  When confronted with the
fact that he was a scumbag his response was "I wanted the pack.""""

I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

>>his response was "I wanted the pack."<<

This seemed to be the point of his post, I'm not sure where you got your
idea from.


Oh, and to be perfectly honest, I really don't care if I offended you or
not. I just put that up because people seem to respond more intelligently
when you are polite.
