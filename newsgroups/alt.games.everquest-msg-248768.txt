Oh.. one other thing. I get called once a month by MCI (and they call again,
they are going to be getting a call from the FTC.. I'm on the DNC list, and
never done business with them). They want me 'In the neighborhood'.  I tell
them a) don't call me, b) you can't provide the services I need. They tell
me they can provide anything I need. I tell them ISDN. They say, 'Oh, I'm
afraid I can't help you enjoy our wonderful service sir, we don't offer
ISDN. But you can get MCI DSL <click>'

(I'm out of DSL range, or I'd have it already, greedy bandwidth hog I am...)
