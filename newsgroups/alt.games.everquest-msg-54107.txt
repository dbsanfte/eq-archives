How much AC, well, that depends on where your AC is, if its at 1000 with
the 15 from the belt, and at 990 after, you just dropped below a soft
cap.  And your damage jumps from 23-50 per hit to 80-100 per hit.  If
you have a damage dealer, then you switch in your fast weapons and keep
on taunting.  Its not that complex.
