    I dinged 30 in about 30 hours played after one month. Took me 4 months
to ding 50, with a substantially decreased play time after the first month.
I was not twinked at all and I don't think I had access to much information
that others don't or that I'm an especially brilliant player. I did I'll
admit have a good group of friends who I could almost always group with, and
possibly a higher than average desire to level up and get on with the game -
but I don't think you need to play for 20 hours a week to zip through the
first 50 levels in a few months.

    Just thought I'd stick my oar in with that info :)

Cheers,
James
