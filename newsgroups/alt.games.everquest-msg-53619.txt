I just got my fifth shawl a couple of weeks ago.

I was fortunate in that I'd already been doing tradeskills, so doing the
first four shawls was just a matter of collecting components.  Heh heh. 
Just collecting.  Heh.

At skill 106, I failed my first combine on the fifth shawl.  75 threads, 5
biles, and oodles of time down the drain.

So I spent some time and got my tailoring to 151 and succeeded on my second
combine.

There are conflicting opinions on raising tailoring beyond 158, when the
Wu's trivials.  After that, the only thing that will raise the skill is the
incredibly expensive and tedious Velious tailoring, and some people think
that it's easier to just eat any combine failures on the 6th and 7th shawls
than it is to raise tailoring to where you have a higher chance of success.

And I agree with them.

But to answer the original question, you can still grandmaster in Smithing
and do the shawl quests.

For a great walkthrough on the shawl quests, go here:
