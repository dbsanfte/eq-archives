I just saw a post on Graffe's saying that Blizzard is adding 16 more
servers.  It looks like they are sorely needed.  I'm not sure I'm can deal
with a game that requires you to get into a login queue.  Even a minute wait
will become daunting if it happens regularly enough.  When I click the
button, I want to play the game.  I've held off on buying WoW because I
figured there would be issues up front.  I'm not going to buy the game until
I'm sure there aren't lines and lines of people fighting over low level
quest spawns.
