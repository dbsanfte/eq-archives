Try looking here;

For your level range there are 2 greens and 1 blue but there is now the cyan
(light blue) con as well.

I would think it would now go something like;

GREEN (11 levels + Lower) You could probably win this fight
CYAN (10 - 8  levels lower)   This creature would pose problems
BLUE (7 -1 levels lower) It appears quite formidable

As was suggested above, it would be an idea to change the colours of the
text so they are easier to differentiate between.
There are plenty of editors out there for this, not sure what one I used
when I did mine but here's one I found;

Look for EQcolors Freeware.

As for hunting grounds, Old world, Sth Karana's Split Paw Spires and Split
Paw. High Keep Warrior and Raider rooms. For Dungeons, Sol A is also in your
range as is Runnyeye.

Most common place to go is LoIO (Lake of Ill Omen) then stay in Kunark until
50 something, this is argueably the fastest route, LoIO, OT, DL and KC but
this is also how you meet the most idiots and when you run into a 50
something player who seems to know nothing about the world and even the
game, chances are he is not EBay, he is from this route of levelling. I
don't suggest avoiding them totally, they are good exp, just change your
scenery once in a while.
