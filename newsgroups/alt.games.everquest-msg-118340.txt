Well now you've opened some doors best left closed.  There is an ongoing
battle in each of our bodies involving our immune systems continually
KILLING foreign germs and bacteria.  So in order to stop this rampant
killing of innocent life our only choice is to die.  But wait, it gets
worse!!  There are also beneficial bacteria which live in our bodies who
would be killed off if their host dies.  This means that we can neither
continue living, nor stop, if we want to fully respect all life forms.

I'll have the turkey stuffed veal, thanks!
