A day late, but still...

What I did on my summer vacation^W^W^W Monday

I spent the day in fabulous Timorous Deep, waiting for guildies
who were late for a Fay ganking. Then, since I, at 52, was the
healer of the MT, I died just before Fay did. Bastard stripped
all my buffs off, and that AoE sure smarts without Circle of
Summer...

Still, a fairly inexperienced guild took him down with 15
people, average level ~ 53-54, and 4 deaths. It was fun, even
if he looks more like a basilisk than a dragon...
