There is no "official" rule, but in general, 200 skill is considered Grand
Master. It is possible to grand master every trade skill (not including
those that are class specific, like poison making and alchemy.)

No 'or' about it. The term 'grand master' is used exclusively with trade
skills (alchemy, baking, brewing, fletching, jewelry, poison, pottery,
smithing, tailoring, tinkering and sometimes fishing) and not with, say
weapon skills, defense, offense, feign death, abjuration or conjuring.

The very max cap for a trade skill is 250. You are allowed to have one
'standard' trade skill (baking, brewing, fletching, jewelry, pottery,
smithing or tailoring) above 200; all other standard trade skills are
capped at 200. Class (alchemy and poison making) and race (tinkering)
specific skills are not bound and may also reach 250. So it is possible to
have a gnome rogue with Tinkering (250), Poison Making (250) and, say,
Fletching (250). All other trade skills would be limited to 200.

That really depends on who you ask. According to EQTraders
(http://www.eqtraders.com), it is. In my guild, the Povar-Tarew Artisans
on Xev, which is a guild dedicated to trade skills, it is not.
