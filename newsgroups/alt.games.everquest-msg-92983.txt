Imbued mithril boots are worthwhile for Tunare druids, but most Karana 
followers are halflings, and by the time they can afford to buy Vale boots 
or gather the materials themselves, they could easily do the acolyte's 
anklet quest (2 WIS anklet, small races only).

Vale boots may be useful for human/half-elf karana druids, but they have a 
very limited market really. I am skilling up on wood-elf leathers atm, I 
tend to only make the boots since they are the most useful piece, and I 
have a hard time selling them, so god knows how hard a halfling tailor must 
find it when there's an easily quested item available to half his market 
which is as good as the one useful piece of vale leather.
