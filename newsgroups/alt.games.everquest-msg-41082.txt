I do follow what goes on, normally and have had my run ins with groups
regulars already, I do not gain any pleasure out of flame wars so I ceased
in responding. I now only comment if it's about EQ and I have an opinion or
knowledge on the subject. I also, rarely disagree with them in these cases.
I know how DT posts when he doesn't agree with someone and considers their
arguements/post "dumb" but his posts here showed little of that "attitude" I
agree with his points as I also see the Validity of Kenthadeus' posts.

Not much else to say, I am still a little stunned and kind of worried where
this will this whole thing is going to lead.

To quote a poster in another NG

"This is the start....of a horrible episode in history."

Normally I'd add a "humorous" comment here about Rangers but I'll leave it
for a more appropriate time.
