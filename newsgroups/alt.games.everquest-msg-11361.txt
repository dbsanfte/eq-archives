Once again we see somebody who suggests something that has been brought up here
repeatedly, without seeing the obvious flaw in the logic:
Problem:  They player community contains a subset of people who are real
assholes.
Solution: We turn the policing of the problem over to the player community.
Translation: We hand the problem of the assholes off *TO* the assholes to
correct.

Hello? Is this on?
You then immediately open the door for a group of seven or eight 13 year olds to
get together and start /assholing %t on somebody who wouldn't give them a free
wurmslayer or some other percieved injustice committed up on them.
It won't work. Sorry.  Verant runs a business. They have to let in people to
make money. People always contain a subset of assholes. There is ZERO way they
could have designed around it.
