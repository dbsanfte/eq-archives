I disagree that warriors should be "preferred" for exp groups, since in EQ
the "preferred way" has a tendancy to move into the realm of "the only way"
too quickly for my taste.  Hence warriors being preferred will mean, to a
lot of people, warriors are the only acceptable tank.  The situation would
be just like it is now, only in favor of warriors intead of knights.  You
won't find any argument from me that warriors need to be fixed, my only
argument here is that they shouldn't be so far ahead of knights so as to be
the only tank that's useful.  (Just like clerics are no longer so far ahead
of druids that druids aren't acceptable when it comes to healing)

And again, soloing doesn't enter the picture as far as I'm concerned.
Warriors can't solo reliably.  That's one thing that is not in question :-)

I like this idea.  I'm not sure how it would balance out for raids, though.

I doubt there are many level 39 clerics healing anyone for 7500hp.  This has
already been addressed by other posters, however, and you're quite correct
that I haven't had experience healing.  But I don't believe my statement was
ignorant at all:  that while druids got big heals, clerics were not made
obselete.  Clerics don't have any trouble finding groups, at level 39 or at
level 65.  They have a wider variety of heals and more mana efficient ones.
Even with a complete lack of knowledge of the healing classes, I know *that*
much.
