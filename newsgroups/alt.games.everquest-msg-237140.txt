Let's see here, my 65BL can slow 65%, off-tank 1200 hitting Sewer
mobs in a pinch, has a pet that does as much damage as the mage
61 air, does decent DPS if he has the mana to use his nukes, adds
a 9 mana per tick buff, a 225hp/+40atk buff that is only obsolete
in a group with a 65 pally with BSS (although the ranger buff is
decent).  Can buff HP around 800 total (SV, Kragg, IoS), and can 
haste melee 50%.

Having played a mage to 65, 75AA and put up with huge LFG times 
(and I actively seek out groups, I don't just sit on my ass hoping
they come to me) it's rather amazing to log onto my BL and get
tells for XP groups and LDoN without even putting LFG up. 

All that said, I don't think we're overpowered.  There are many
classes that solo faster, solo harder mobs and many classes with
as much group desireability.  However, classes who don't solo as
well and see themselves as being less desireable to groups (mages
for one) look at that combination of abilities with a great deal
of envy.

They forget that it costs serious plat to get a BL to a decent level
of capability (around 300k in my droppable equipment atm, and that
doesn't include the 40k I payed for my 65 slow.)

Rather than bitch about it and try to get them nerfed, I just made
one - the grass is truly greener.
