Here's my understanding as a software guy: Because the i810 is
on-board video, it can continue to cause bugs even after you add on a
card. DirectX queries all video output devices during its message loop
and can get bad data from on-board chips.

This comes from the dark recesses of my memory from when I was first
learning DirectX programming. It may no longer be the case.
