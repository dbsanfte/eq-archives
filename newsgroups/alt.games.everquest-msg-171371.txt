VJF-you genius!!, just a bit more help plz---ok,  i had some success
with your idea, but it dos'nt last-arrggg-i went to the MB
settings-and found ddr voltage and vcore voltage-i assume these are
the 'memory and cpu'  voltage settings u talked about?there was
nothing called cpu or memory- the ddr voltage has 4 possible
setting-it was on 2.5 and has 2.6,2.7,2.8    the vcore also has 4
possible settings with'normal as default, then +5.%, +7.5%, +10%-- i
increased each one seperatly, starting with ddr to 2.6-no luck
crashed, then to ddr2.6 & vcore+5%, crash-did thisprocess untill ddr
2.7 and vcore +7.5%-SUCCESS-got game up, played for approx half an
hour-then crash to desk top-restarted machine-got game going-after
about half hr again-crash to desk top-SIGH-so close soooo far :(  I'm
a bit afraid to set the voltage at the highest-although that would be
logical-any idea's? can i hurt my machine by upping the volts to the
highest on both?-thanks for any help-Ironeyes
