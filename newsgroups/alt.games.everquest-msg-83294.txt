Here is your proof both Brad Mcquaid and Jeff Butler are gone and the
following is from kelly flock of sony onlune on what Eq thinks of its
gamers.

Penny Arcade takes on Sony's Kelly Flock. Flock was recently quoted in Edge
magazine about how he loves customer input.



"No, we never talk to consumers - they just ##### (edited - Archangel) us
up. Someone asked for a copy of our market research which made us take the
decision to do EverQuest. I said we hadn't done any market research. Had we
done, the game would never have been made. We never focus on them. Gamers
don't know what they want. We just want to know if they have a valid credit
card."
