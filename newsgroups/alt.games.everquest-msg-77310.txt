If you have all the expansions and whatnot, and you want to install
everquest on a different computer, using the same account, can you do this?
I wanted to put it on my laptop and not my main PC.  Do the expansions
register with the account, and let you play them from any PC, or does it let
you only do this from one PC, then need to buy the expansions again?
