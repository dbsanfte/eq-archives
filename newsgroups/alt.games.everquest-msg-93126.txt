Depends on what you want to get out of tradeskills.  If your goal is to
get rich or to make things that will help you in battle you might just
rethink the whole thing.  Otherwise Baking is perfect for druids and
Brewing isn't bad either.  Both will put your foraged goods to use and
neither will be impacted by your being from Surefall.

Oh and quit slagging on the Half Elf druids, show some pride!  As a half
elf you take a beating better than most of them fancy elf druids or the
little fur foots.  Get yourself some AC gear and you can tank hehe.

th
lvl 35 and lvl 51 Half Elf druids and proud of em!!
