A number of times I have got a SoW and just run straight through along the
path in Kith at night around 19-30 while I was fighting in Highkeep.
Sometimes I didn't see any undead, sometimes I saw them but outran them
(most are pretty slow),  sometimes (especially against caster ones) I had to
use LoH.  And yes, sometimes I died.  Never saw the Commander once, but yes
as others have suggested, take the wall.  I do know that one spot where they
will path to is not far from the Rivervale zone, so watch out there.  As for
IvU (or ItU as nearly everyone on my server calls it)  I found it kept
dropping too quickly for me, whether it was because I had only just got the
spell or something I don't know.

I rarely go through Kith these days as usually the place I want to go is far
enough away to warrant a port, and of course at my level now I could nearly
start hunting in Kith anyway.
