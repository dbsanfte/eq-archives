I want to move the spell messages to a different window.  Not the
"soAndSo begins to cast a spell" - that I was able to move easily to
my "spam" box.  I'm actually after the RESULTING message from buffs.
"SoAndSo's eyes gleam with Virtue" for example.  I can't seem to
figure out what filter that is - or what its tied to.

I'm trying to get my "main" chat window down to just /gsay and a
channel.  Nothing else.   This weekend I figured that if the spell
messages were going THERE, why not just switch my windows around and
re-filter - my assumption was that those messages go to the first real
chat window.  Well after I switched my windows around and refiltered I
find those messages back in my main window...  Nuts.

Note, I don't want to turn 'em off - I just want 'em in a different
window.  Any ideas?
