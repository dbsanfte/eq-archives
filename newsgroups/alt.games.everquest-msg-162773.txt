Ding ding ding, got it in one!

A former guild I was in used to allow anyone to roll on any item that
dropped on a raid, if they felt that they had a need for it.  They also
allowed people to award the item they won to someone else if they felt like
it.

The result was the formation of a few cliques of people that would agree to
roll on stuff for each other.  "You roll on this uber BP and award it to me
if you win, and I'll do the same thing for you on the uber sword."  In
effect, the winner got multiple chances to roll.

That guild no longer exists.

I can see the same potential in your system.  "Hey, let's both roll on the
item.  If I win, I'll give it to you, and if you win you give it to me."

The guild I'm in now does strict merit loot, decided by the officers. You
earn merit for contributing, and you can contribute in a variety of ways,
not just for attending raids.  

People who spend a lot of time leveling earn merit, even if they skip raids
to do it, because higher-level people are of more use to the guild as a
whole (this doesn't really apply once they hit 60, though).  People who
spend time working on tradeskills to make items for people earn merit.  And
of course, regularly showing up for raids and such.

The key is that there are no "points" awarded for anything.  And who really
wants to keep track of that crap anyway?  The officers know who has what
kind of gear, they know who's been contributing, and they know where to put
the item to give the maximum benefit to the guild.

This only works if you trust your officers.  They haven't abused their trust
once, and it's worked out very very well for us.
