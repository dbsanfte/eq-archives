XP, pre-release, currently asks you if you want to send detailed information to M$.
Most people won't know any better. What happens when M$ removes the option to deny?
When they don't even inform customers that this is being done? They have done it
before, M$, and several other companies. Fortunately, they were caught.

The code to send detailed information down to the serial number of every hardware and
software component of your system exists in XP, don't blind yourself to it.

On top of that, I don't care to have all of my computers hooked up to the net, which
means *if* I wanted to run xp, I would have 3 machines on which I couldn't, without
exposing them, however briefly, to the entire net. Fortunately I am quite happy having
them run the latest version of 64-bit Linux, despite its flaws. If it weren't for EQ,
every machine I own would be runing the better operating system.
