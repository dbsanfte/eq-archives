That's a remarkably ignorant thing to suggest.

1:  Some people, amazingly enough, do not use Windows.

2:  Some people, amazingly enough, would prefer to use a newreader
that was actually worth a damn.  For everything other than picture
viewing, Outlook is a pain in the ass, stupidly designed piece of
shit.  Of course, Microsoft deciding to use a frustrating posting
standard is par for course for the company.

3:  Some people, amazing enough, would rather not have to sit through
a lenghty download just to hear "I agree with this post".  Believe it
or not, but the rest of us really don't give a damn about your pretty
background graphics and fancy fonts.  Just give us the message,
goddammit.
