That's one benefit of playing with "Ubahs".  You get the crap.  I sure 
don't mind getting crap when it's an upgrade!

Me, the cleric from that group, our other cleric ( he was logging soon ), a 
ranger, a druid, and a pally went to Velks for about 2 hours last night.  
Pretty nice EXP for me, I must say, and they seemed to think the EXP was 
good for them, too.  The druid got about 16 of his threads to add to the 4 
he already had.  I have a feeling we are going to be in this place a -lot-.  

What are these camps and what's the benefit ( nice drop, silks, play, etc ) 
of each:  US, UD, Fake
