I played my bard from release to about 5 months?   Maybe 6.
I switched ISP's and my ping climbed into the mid 300's 
(from 185ish) and I found twisting to much of a chore then.

I grouped with a pair of druids when we were 15-17ish down
in "old" Splitpaw (before higher level gnolls "evicted" the
original inhabitants) - and they loved me.  I constantly
kept aggro, no matter what they did.  Also, this was when
lullabye was in its pre nerf stages - I was able to reliably
keep large groups of blues asleep while only getting hit
occasionally.  

The road to uselessness for lullabye and pixie strike still
irks me - they decided the 2 songs were overpowered, so they
added a secondary resist to them - one which was supposed to
go down as the level difference between bard and target went
up.  Some of the truly analytically minded folks on the
EQ-bards mailing list did exhaustive tests that proved the
secondary resist was a constant 30% regardless of level 
difference - yet we were told over and over that the resists
were working "as intended".  <sigh>  

That saga, and the attitude of post 30 players towards bards
of "just play mana song" made me not pick him up again after
I got DSL.
