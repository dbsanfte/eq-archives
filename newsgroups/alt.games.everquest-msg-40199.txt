One other quest I would recommend is to do the Bracers of the Revenant.  +5
wis and AC 8 or 13, dont' remember which.    Boots of the Reliant is also
nice (need to be a little higher than you currently are for both, mid 20's I
believe).
Also, Unrest if fun for a Cleric at your level.  There are some wis items
there (for instance, Blood Stained Tunic), good exp, and just plain fun for
the undead-loving Cleric we all know you are.

I prefer the method of quests than powerleveling to higher levels so you can
afford better equip.  The reason for that is that 1. there are some quests
for Clerics in the lower levels that provide *fun* for the Cleric to
accomplish. If that is your goal, I'd suggest not blowing by them. 2.,
You're going to eventually hit the higher levels, with more money, anyway;
why not enjoy the trip?

Just my $0.02 copper pieces
