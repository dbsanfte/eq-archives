  Mike's definitions of "dying" and "dead" are, perhaps, the most 
conservative.
Reading the complaints of many people who feel the game is "dying", it seems
to me they are hyperbolically trying to express some degree of regret, even
lamentation, that the game *is* fading, losing popularity. EQ is over the 
hill,
and it's not a smooth slope down the other side; no, it's cliffs, like the 
ones
we climbed going up, and going the other way you slip and fall and land on
your ass (as character animations often show us).
  Lower populations have all sorts of baneful effects. Friends leave, not in 
ones
and twos but in big groups, whole circles. Suddenly you don't know anyone 
else
playing anymore; it's like you changed servers, but you haven't gone 
anywhere -
everyone else has deserted you. The bazaar will never again see as many as 
300
traders in it, barring a server merger; most days it never gets above 200. 
This
makes it upwards of twice as hard to get something you want; many items are
not available anymore at any price, others are in reduced quantities and 
prices
are wildly inflated. Camps that used to be permanantly occupied are now wide 
open;
the people who once grouped there kept them alive because they liked the 
faster
character progression of the early game. Now, they have gone to where they 
can
keep the pace up into their 30s and 40s: EQ2 and WoW. Storied guilds, once
feared by the gods of Time, collapse and merge, leaving the casual player 
and the
weekend warrior with potentially no path to the upper planes - you can't 
join the
raid unless you can do so during prime time, five nights a week.
  Actually, this last problem may be solved, not exacerbated, by the low 
populations:
after looking at some of the Time guilds on TP, I find Invictvs and 
Crusaders Valorous
no longer mention required raiding in their policies. CV even limits its 
raids to 72
people; apparently, they have no trouble fielding that many.
  As to where Adastraea goes...that's a story for another thread. But do 
notice the
sig...
