Huh?  Are you serious?  That doesn't make any sense.  I lose some, but not 
anywhere near 2/3 of a blue.  Given that a a 56 rez returns 96% of the 
experience lost, you would have to lose over 16 blue without a rez.  That 
is more than 3 yellows.  Either you're mistaken, or you're seriously, 
seriously bugged.

Now this makes absolutely no sense.  All the stats I've seen, everyone 
I've spoken too, and my own observations makes it very clear that an AA 
level is MUCH faster than level 60.  I set my split at 50-50 and watched, 
my AA bar filled up slightly more than twice as fast as my regular exp 
bar.  No, I didn't die and get a rez and let that fuck up the 
calculations.  Seriously, get both bars to right at a miniding, then set 
to 50%, and exp until one of the bars has a full yellow of EXP.  If you're 
not bugged the AA will have gone up one yellow, and the regular a bit over 
2 blue.

If what you're saying is true, you need to /bug this.  Unless the bug is 
that level 60 EXP is extra fast for Iksar.
