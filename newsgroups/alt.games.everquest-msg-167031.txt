Oh, thats different.

As a bard, this was not happening to me.  My pets quite frequently sent me "I cant
attack that mob" messages, in fact, even though they were busy fighting the unmezed
mob at the time.  They still do that post patch, too.

However, I can certainly see how it would suck for a chanter, the "pets don't attack
mezed mobs" was a massive upgrade for them.
