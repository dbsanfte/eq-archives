I had looked at EQ atlas, and Paladul Caverns seemed like just the right
place to try and solo my level 16 Ranger. Things had been teal'ing up
rapidly in NK where I was fighting, and I thought it was a good tmie for a
change.

After reading some of the posts here about Paladul however Im beginning to
wonder if its simply to much for a solo 16 ranger.

Can anyone give me any advice as to wether or not I should take my little
ranger down there ? For information purposes shes wearing mostly all Banded
armor with a Shiny brass shield. Primary weapon is a Short sword of Yakesha.
When I hit 17 Ill have an Ebon Scimitar ( at least I think its called that )
in my off hand. This is on the Vallon Zek ( Team PvP ) server, so Im not
sure how good my chances of grouping would be.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!
