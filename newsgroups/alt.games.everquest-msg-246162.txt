Assuming the bug story is true, suppose they had just restored the tables to
what was intended.  To humans, it would appear that they had suddenly gaind
a bunch of XP, because the amount of XP recorded for them in the character
database would be worth more in terms of levels after the change.
Meanwhile, to halflings, it would appear that they had lost XP.  If you
were, say, a halfling just into 20 before the table change, you would be 19
or lower after the change.

That would certainly cause a lot of complaining!

What they probably would have had to do is go through the character
database, lookup the XP for each human and halfling, translate that into a
level and fractional level, calculate what XP on the new table would give
the same level and fractional level, and change the XP of the character to
that.

For the first three years or so of EQ, they seemed to be very reluctant to
do anything that involved mass changes to anything in the character
database.

When they removed the class-based penalties, they did it by leaving the
tables and the character database alone, and instead simply made it so on
kills, etc., the people with the penalties were given extra XP to cancel out
the penalty.  They could use that same trick to fix halflings and humans if
they wanted to.
