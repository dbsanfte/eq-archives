I watched my wife once log into her dark elf on FV, and she was in a tiny
grey room with a bunch of numbers on the walls.  No way out of it.  Camped
and came back, and she was in 3rd gate.  /loc showed her at (if I remember
right) 0.0,0.0 in Neriak Third Gate.  Wierdest thing I have ever seen, wish
I had a screenshot of it.
