When I or my usual mates are running a group, we always describe NBG as
being "you will replace what you are currently wearing/using with it," and
for things like sand verbena, "You will use the item for your tradeskills
instead of selling it."  If it's not an upgrade for anyone, we all roll.
And if we catch you saying it's an upgrade when it's not, you get
blacklisted.  (Side note: I'm also on Tunare.  Now I'm wondering who that
Rogue is--I had one roll on a +5 charisma augment when I--Enchanter--was the
only one in the group who needed the stat.  I thought he was joking until he
looted it.  He said it was an accident, that he forgot it was a major
Enchanter stat, but you still wonder, y'know?)

We also divvy up the 'minor' augs (+sv fire, poison, +10 mana, etc.) as a
different thing than the 'major' ones (effects, int, str, sometimes sv
magic).  We hate to see even a +10 mana aug rot, but it seems unfair to hold
it against someone if a +5 int one drops that they can use, too.
