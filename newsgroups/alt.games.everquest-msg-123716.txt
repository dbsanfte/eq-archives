Damb DT sometimes you can be really pedantic.
(You seem to be more pedantic recently, perhaps I'm just noticing more)

The OP was asking about gear dependence.
I think he was talking about which class can get away with out spending
much pp / time camping for gear. This has thread walked into CRs and
restart from naked chars.

In this case it does not matter. With the exception of the malachite
mages can summon the summoned items when on a CR, restarting from naked
or throughout their levels with out camping for the summoned items or
buying them.

Which ever way you count it the summoned items don't count as gear for
the purposes of this thread. 

Yes they are "gear" 
Yes they are items
No this is is not relivent to this thread in any way.

Hope that helps you to change the record.

Jim
