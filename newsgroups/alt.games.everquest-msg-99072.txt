I ran across this while perusing the ShowEQ message boards for 
information on the EXP changes:

http://www.geocities.com/mathmagicexposed/

Now I can't vouch for the numbers there, but if they are correct then
the extra EXP previously required to clear 30, 35, 40, and 45 have
simply been shifted to the succeeding four levels. Thus the EXP
required to clear 30-34 or 35-39 or 40-44 or 45-49 are exactly
the same as before, just redistributed. And this would imply
that each character's raw EXP number was adjusted during the
mega-patch so that their yellow/blue exp bars would remain
where they were.
