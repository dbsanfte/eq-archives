I have 2 machines now running EQ and was wondering about the new servers...

1. My XP P4 has phantom mouse cursor, Distorted sound, strange graphics
after zoning, slowdown and occasional trips to the desktop - most while
zoning. cable, 512, gforce etc etc. New drivers, installs etc etc. Been to
tech forum, tech chat etc etc.

2. My ME machine has dialup and pretty reasonable play but sometimes pure
hell (tech did do a trace and said connection was ok ) - It can take 2 hours
to go through freeport and pick up some tiny daggers and training. zone - LD
char active, zone - LD char active, zone - LD char active - buy - gate LD
char active. New drivers, new installs etc etc. Amazingly frustrating.

So those are my version of EQ - now new servers? Will they have a better
game play? Will my issues be fixed? When are the present SOL promises like
the bazaar going to be implimented - Why do we have to immediately jump on
the bandwagon to get into the new EQ? Does it require new software (doh)?
Will it affect our use of the old servers or are we now in a whole new
world? What I saw on the EQ demo was kind of what SOL was promising was it?
I am interested in what everyone else is thinking about this new offer.
Thanks
Jim
