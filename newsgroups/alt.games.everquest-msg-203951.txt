I'd not bother with clinging darkness and fear.  Pets heal much faster than
players, so it's OK if the pet takes a beating, as long as it doesn't die.
Pull the mob with poison bolt, send the pet, and then step in and start
meleeing yourself.  You can probably out-aggro the pet, and eventually the
mob will attack you.  Just stop attacking and back away, and the pet will
get aggro back.  You can start attacking again.  With a little practice, you
can balance your aggro and the pet's aggro, and control which of you the mob
is attacking.  If your HP gets a little low, let the pet take aggro, step
back, and use lifespike to heal yourself and hurt the mob.

You can keep this up for several levels.  At level 8, you'll get a spell to
heal the pet.

Fear is nice, but at low levels, it is resisted too much, and it uses a lot
of mana.
