Not having played a rogue in a long time, I would say put the points
in skills that are annoying or booring to raise. Skills that do not go
up through normal activities. Such as Lockpicking. Not too much to use
that skill on in the game, but when you find yourself in one of those
rare dungeons that progress is blocked until you locate a key or have
a rogue lockpick the door, people will be very happy that you are
around.

Also here's an idea, no clue how feasable it is though. Get two
friends that are going to the Bazaar for the night. Group with them.
Then go get an LDoN, sneak through the LDoN until you find a chest you
can disarm and open. Loot up, then leave and get another.
