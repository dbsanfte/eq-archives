Kids should not be allowed anywhere near Usenet, and doubly so for the
alt.* hierarchy in particular. Believe me, profanity is the *least*
worrying thing they would be exposed to.

Well, I tend to subscribe to the opposite view. Profanity is precious,
and can be liberating and cathartic, and it should be used sparingly for
two reasons: One, because it may lose some of its power through overuse,
and another, because used in excess it can cause some people to shut you
out without actually listening to what you have to say. Profanity should
be neither the pasta nor the sauce, but the pepper on top.

Usenet is not a polite place, believe me. It's more like a steelworks*;
you can visit, but you must have a pretty high tolerance for loud noise
and hot air.

*the steelworks analogy breaks down when you consider that in addition
to heat and noise, a steelworks plant actually produces something useful
:)
