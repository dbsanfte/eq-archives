Check your datarate.txt file.  Default is 5, but with cable you can set it
at 9 and with DSL 8 seems to work well.  With a T3 9 is ok, too.

Holy shit!  It might have been simply too much data for the server in that
one zone to handle effectively (read:human speed, not computer speed...
the computer probably had no trouble calculating the effects of the AoW's
melee -vs- the MT's hps/dmg/defense -vs- 13 clerics healing -vs- a druid
chain, but it COULD very well choke in deciding how to display that
information
for the 70 some-odd individual computers seemed to have had clustered
around a certain target in one single zone).  I'd like to know the numbers
on the raid, simply from hearing the numbers of healers.

Again, it sounds to me more like a display problem.  Try NOT healing so
much, as well as the other lag-dropping steps (turn off new models,
spell effects, server-side filtering, etc).  I mean, again, that's a LOT for
a top end server to figure out in Real time for a full-screen graphical
interface, at least as far as deciding what gets sent to who's client to
display so that it doesn't confict with what is happening in the "real"
world in real time.
