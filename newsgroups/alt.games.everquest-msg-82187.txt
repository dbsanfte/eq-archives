Aye, my main is a 52 shaman, and I've been saving for a JBB for the past 7
months.  I'm on Tarew Marr, the accepted price a month ago was 12kpp,
although I've been told by many people that the price has dropped to closer
to 9kpp.  I have saved up 8, so I can't wait.  I have over 80 days playing
time on my shaman, so a JBB would very much add to my enjoyment.
