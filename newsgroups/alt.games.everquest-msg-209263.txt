Maybe they are used to grouping with a melee who *can* get aggro when a
shaman slows on incoming (pretty much all hybrids can do this).  I know I
can, and of course I need it, because I don't tank so graceful against an
unslowed heavy-hitter.

There is an advantage to having a mob slowed immediately, though a smart
shaman knows that if they are grouping with a warrior MT, the warrior not
only can't grab aggro immediately, but can actually handle the extra
pounding that the hybrid could not.  It's an adjustment an experienced
shaman would know.  Perhaps the "stupid" shaman you are grouped with might
benefit from you explaining that your HP/AC are adequate to withstand a
non-slowed mob for a while.  They might thank you for the insight.
