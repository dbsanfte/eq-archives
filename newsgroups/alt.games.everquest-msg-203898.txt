I haven't played EQ since at least last fall. I have begun playing again 
in the past week and heard talk in the EQTraders chat two nights ago of 
a 500 trader limit in the Bazaar. I had gone trader mode a few nights 
after resuming play and hadn't had any problems, I assume my server 
(Cazic Thule) didn't have as much population as these other peoples' 
servers and thus we didn't hit the limit.

That same night I heard them talking about it, however, I tried to go 
trader and was unable due to the limit.

Is Verant planning to increase the limit or create another nearby zone 
for trading? I can imagine the 500 trader limit is very annoying to 
those who rely heavily upon their trading characters. I can't say that I 
blame these people who have a second character just for trading, 
considering they're paying for another account and are helping out the 
game's economy (generally).

I'd love to see something done about this though.
