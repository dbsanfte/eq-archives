No... it was always a large period of time for possible spawns

Search safehouse and you will see many many posts about a common problem...
a guild kills mobx,y and z, but their associated warder* hadn't yet
spawned -- meaning there was no way to proceed in the dungeon, and depending
on the random factor.. a gm either helped or turned a blind eye (more often
turned a blind eye)

Warders were a mechanism to stop "jumping" key mobs in the zone.. think of
it as a linear raid but rather than a mobs death triggering the pop of
boss_02 (e.g Rhags, Cursed), the death would actually remove a mob (warder).

These warders were untargetable,unkillable, and banished anybody who got in
their way to a random part of VT (hi instant ownage as your banished to a
room of 8 mobs)

They were situated along the way after certain named, and also in the room
in the way of Aten Ha Ra.  It was skippable using SoS/Rez stick (albeit 100x
harder fight) but then got changed again, to give her "powers" from the
warders

Anyway if all warders arent up when you start VT, and you kill any named,
you blow the "legitimate" clearing for a whole week

Yeah, top class planning !! All caused because of the 1-24 hour random pop
timer
