Welcome to the game. I would say go straight out the WC gates and
continue into the East Commons zone. Here you can kill spiderlings and
black wolves quite easily at your level I believe. They should con
blue. Save all the spiderling silks and wolf skins/pelts. Before you
ding 6 you will be able to either sell the silks for 4 to 5pp per
stack and make tattered leather armor for yourself from the skins.
Just don't venture too far beyond the second inn you come to.
