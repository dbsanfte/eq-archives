LOL. At first I thought this was going to be something about how every
car you saw had its headlights on for no reason.

I don't really think that this is the best way, anyway, because:
A) It won't/wouldn't/didn't reach enough people
and B) Lots of people drive with headlights on, anyway--and since
everyone won'ould'n't be, I don't think it would/did/will have any
effect.

Maybe a "national windows-down" day, next month, would be a better
idea.
