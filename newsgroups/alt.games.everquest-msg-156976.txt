We've done it by having a bard train the whole lot of them to the zone
with stragglers being picked off by the monks. Takes a bit longer, and
the suicide rate is a bit higher, but it's doable.

And we have five epic rogues, and have done quite a few more for friends
in smaller ally guilds who can't manage a General raid. There's options.
You just have to get creative like anyplace else.

Last night we had an impromptu Fear raid. No guilds in there and the
zone was full pop. (Yes, we were gambling that the server would stay
up.) We only had three groups, and it wasn't even our biggest lineup.
But we found that you can get the Dracoliche away from Fright by having
a necro train it to the zone corner using Harmshield. he he.

Rather painful for the necro, though. ;-)
