    Good lord.  The AGE FAQ doesn't read that way, does it?  I had a pretty
big part in influencing how it looks today, and I did my best to make it
actually readable.  I think the changes Don Woods had made to it only
improves it in this regard.  If our FAQ is like that, then I would have to
say that perhaps the source material is ultimately to blame.  EQ is a
complex game, full of stuff.  Any FAQ that attempts to address this is
going to be pretty full of stuff as well.
