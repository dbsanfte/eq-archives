Please remind me when Alter Planes were introduced in Everquest. And if 
you remember that, would you also remember what armor people wore on 
their first plane raids? Let me remind you, there was no Crafted or 
Lambent. There was banded and bronze, mixed with various toys from Guk

I believe pathing in Mistmoore was fixed two years after release...

Hmm, well, get a rez. And even running back is quite a bit less of a 
problem than it is in EQ.

Huh? No, everyone in the realm does 5% less damage. For 2 hours or so
