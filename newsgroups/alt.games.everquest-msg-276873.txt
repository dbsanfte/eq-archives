I used to do that, and sometimes still do if I'm in a hurry (I really
have no problem faction farming in WC while awaiting daybreak :).
However, on two seperate occasions, when I was the only one in the
zone, I have run across, and subsequently been killed and severely
wounded by some undead mobs that decided it would be fun to wander to
the walls.  Granted, this was during the pathing issues a while back,
and has likely been fixed since then.  Still gives me pause about going
in there at night :)

Heh.  My wife will often do that sort of thing to other mobs and NPC's
that used to give her grief at lower levels.  It's funny.
