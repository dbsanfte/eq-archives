Combining 2 silk threads makes 1 silk bandage. During the early levels this can
save you a fair bit of money. The main reason is, you can't fail at making silk
threads (or silk swatches for that matter) so it's a cheap way to raise your
tailoring skill level 15. The really good thing is you don't have to place any
practice points in Tailoring to make them either. :)
