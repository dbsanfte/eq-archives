I have a humorous addition to this tale.  The night the picture was taken,
Jakugg, Tiru and I agreed to meet at Velk's zone tunnel and continue the
kodiak and occasional wurm slayings.  I logged on last night a few hours
before Jakugg and Tiru and got a partial group going doing the bears.  There
was a 37 warrior, 34 cleric, 34 rogue and myself (38 rogue at the time)  We
were having a melee of a good time hunting the bears and occasional wurms
and waiting for Jakugg and Tiru to log on.  Or puller saw that Icetooth (the
named bear) was up and began to pull him.  A minute later, we got "hmmm, he
must have poofed" doh! I admit that somewhere in the back of my mind, I
suspected trouble was coming! but I ignored it as always.  Our puller then
said " I see a wurm though, should I pull it? Sure... we all replied.  "ok,
incoming"

just then, Jakugg and Tiru popped into view. "Good timing", I thought and
invited them.  We barely had time for a "Hi" when we got the "OOPS!" from
our puller.   Turned to see the warrior coming down the tunnel with the wurm
and the nicest train of bears you could ever imagine. Icetooth leading the
way! DOH! A very hectic battle ensued with one casualty :-( but with the
help of some 50+ bystanders who happened to zone in at the right
(snickering) time, We killed em all.  Even got a high rez for the death.
Jakugg was a trooper and never said a word, but I chuckle thinking about his
"WTF!" that must have popped into his head as he logged into that train! LOL
