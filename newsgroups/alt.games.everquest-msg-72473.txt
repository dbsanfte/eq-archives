EQ has a large European user base, in fact there are so many, EQ recently
opened up a UK server.  There are PvP servers if you choose to play on one,
but most are non-PvP (blue servers).  You still can choose to be PvP on a
blue server, but most people do not.  And of course, you don't have to play
on the UK server, there are many Euros that play on all servers.

Yes you can just buy the original game and try it out.  The only limitation
to not having the expansion packs is that you cannot travel to those lands
or start characters of those races.

When you die, you lose some experience.  Your corpse falls to the ground
where you died and you must travel to it and get (loot) your items back.
Corpses under level 5 decay (disappear permanently) in 30 minutes, older
corpses stay for 24 hours of online time or a week of offline time.  So, as
long as you don't travel too far in your first 5 levels, you should be able
to get your armor and items back.  When you die you go back to your bind
point, which can be moved by caster type players of a certain level to gain
the spell.  You can bind yourself almost anywhere, but if you must rely on
someone else to bind you, then you are restricted to binding in cities and a
couple other exceptions.

And I imagine it works with WinXP Pro, we have WinXP and don't have any
problems playing.  You may want to make sure you have lots of RAM tho...
since our latest expansion pack, RAM is very essential.

Hope this answers your questions.... hope to see ya in game!
