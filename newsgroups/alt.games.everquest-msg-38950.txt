And that's why I rarely bother using illusions ;)  I 
prefer to pretend I'm super-fast - especially when I'm 
running away from something big.

On another note, what REALLY sucks is when you forget 
you had memorized "Minor Illusion" in the place of 
"Illusion: Half Elf", click on it, discover you can't 
move, and hear "TRAIN!" while you're standing on the 
tracks. :)
