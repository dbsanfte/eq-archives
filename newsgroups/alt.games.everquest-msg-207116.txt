On Tunare, where I played Kaev, the waiting list for the books off
Naggy/Vox ran for months for the Paladins who made every kill (it
was strict seniority based on how many kills you were in on).  And
while it's true that not every raiding guild is filled with foul
mouthed children, it is also true that I was never in a position to
make the required time commitment to join a guild capable of taking
down Gorenaire even if I found such a guild I wanted to join (and
that assumes that said guild would be interested in yet another
Paladin, hardly a sure thing).  I helped Druids, Bards, Rogues,
Warriors, Rangers, Magicians, Wizards, and at least one BL, get
various epic drops.  But there was never any real possibility that
Kaev would ever get his epic, and when PoP came out it became a
whole lot less important.  Of course, now I don't play him anymore
and so it's not important at all.  I don't know if I'll go after
Druid epic with my main on Stromm, tho I'm leaning against it.
