Every "sane" adult knows the difference between right and wrong based on
what they have been educated to believe is right and wrong.  There are
likely to be differences of opinion depending on the education in question.
There are situations, right up to what most of us would call murder that
could be considered right depending on your upbringing.  Many people believe
that execution of convicted criminals is wrong, and is murder, many do not,
and this is even within a single country.  Is there an absolute right or
wrong (good or evil) in this case?
