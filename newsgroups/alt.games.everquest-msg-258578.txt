Well, went and made a ranger without any tips from you slackers.

Halfling ranger, so he's got hide and sneak straight off in case they 
come in handy, and because what the heck, 10% faster exp for a race 
thats better than human?  Why not, I don't have to be proud.

I plunked every point into Wis, figuring that Track is his most 
important attribute, and that a higher stat here will help him learn it 
faster.

My chosen name, Granger, was taken... later I noticed on a map of POK 
that its taken by one of the two main bank bankers.  So I went with 
Grager, which is less amusing to me, but should help me show up when 
friends do a who all Grage.

I opted out of the tutorial in favor of running to Nexus and spending 
the 8kpp I'd alloted myself, plus picking up some junk my Berserk had in 
his trader bags.

Spent some time looking, but eventually settled on a Lamentation, 10/20 
was best ratio I could find for the damage capped levels, and I don't 
expect he'll ever get past damage cap levels.  There were weapons with a 
better ratio but only due to the damage rating being higher than 10; as 
far as I can tell you might as well treat any damage number over 10 as 
being 10 until you hit level 20.

Other choice I could have made was 9/19... several suggestions from the 
peanut gallery (aka serverwide.age) were a bit better but none of them 
were in the bazaar.

I picked up an Iksar Chestplate, blowing most of my cash there, and 
filled in with HP gear in every slot till I ran down to 19pp; I'm still 
half naked but over 400hp at level 1, and with the +5 hp regen and a .5 
ratio weapon I'm feeling pretty good.

I also got a bow, somethign like steel compound, its reccomended level 
50, most stats on it are terrible at my level, but it had a range of 200 
instead of the 75 or 150 that the other bows have, and I dont' imagine 
I'll care about bow damage for a long time if ever; I just wanted the 
longest range pulling weapon I could get.  100pp, not a problem.

I didn't, however, find any arrows in bulk; I balked at paying 10pp per 
arrow as you might imagine, even if I was blowing thru a few Kpp in 
twink money.  I tried using Find for archery supplies in Rivervale and 
POK and got no luck, not till later after logging out did I recall the 
secret word is Fletching.  Anyway, I might do my own fletching, or I 
might just stock up on tons of 1cp cheap arrows off vendor; I don't 
recall just how much trouble it is to make long range arrows (arrows do 
add to range don't they? )

Log out, log back in in tutorial mode, follow thru the annoying tutorial 
sequence so as to get a maxed out charm (generally you won't see better 
till over 60, figure I might as well do it before hitting level 6 just 
in case I decide I do want to level up a tracker)

Oddly, you don't get the original opening part of the tutorial if you do 
things this way; my berserk made it to second level and had had a couple 
fights by the time he started doing the charm quest; ranger missed that 
part.  There was one instruction on the quest I couldn't follow, selling 
some kobold shackles to the merchant; that didn't matter, my charm still 
capped out.

You -do- get a level one spell, which is a 5 point heal.  Sadly, you 
don't get alteration skill until level 9, so you can't actually use it 
to train up with, at least not till later; it does cast very fast and is 
cheap, I guess better than using minor healing when I finally do get the 
skill.  Same spell seems to go to paladins and... SK I think.  Some 
other hybrid caster/tank, but I dont' think beastlord.

Then I ran around killing things, 5 spiderlings/rats later I was level 
2, I just kept charging ahead killing whatever I felt like.  Kobold 
shaman was dead easy, warrior actually took a little while; in fact the 
same was true of the taskmasters; higher level but easier to kill than 
the warriors.  I pulled the Slaver room in pairs by running in, hitting 
a mob and backing out of the room fast.  Then I pulled Slaver, who was 
tougher; yellow to me at level 3, probably level 5 if I recall 
correctly.  He got me down to under 50% hp before dying.

Well, securely level 3 and having taken out all the challenges in the 
tutorial, I used the "I want to go home" line, got out, and trained my 
tracking up to 17 via guildmaster, as well as giving myself a point in 
BW and... something else.  Oh, foraging.  Might end up needing toon to 
forage for some quest or other someday, may as well start working it up.

Logged out, I'll get back on and start clearing out Tox forest sometime 
later.

Grager, 3 Halfassed Ranger, Luclin
