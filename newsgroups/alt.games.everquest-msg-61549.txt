  Eh, that kind of sucks.  Last time I checked, nobody LIKES begging for
teleports (and I've never met a teleporter, myself included, who likes being
begged from), and so Verant makes the decision to make teleports the ONLY
method by which to get to and from their new expansion area (which
apparently will have hunting areas for ALL level ranges) and to boot they
make it so only a single class has access to those teleports.

  I suppose on top of that we're going to need to teleport FROM a specific
location, line one of the "quadroliths".  Talk about a pain.  I hope they do
something to make the teleports at least a bit more accessible, like making
them relatively low level or giving them low mana costs.
