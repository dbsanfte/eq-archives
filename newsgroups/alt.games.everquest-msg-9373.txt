Gargoyle eyes drop off gargoyles in Ocean of Tears and Mistmoor.  If you 
ride from FP to BB Mtns, the first stop, nicknamed Sister Isle, may have a 
vendor you can buy these from.  There is an island close by upon which 
gargoyles live.  Visit http://www.eqatlas.com/ for a decent map of the 
zone.

Hill giant toes drop from Hill Giants found on Antonica in several zones 
(NK, EK, Rathe Mtns to name a few.  The Forest and Mountain Giants in 
Kunark and other types of giants have their own drops.  Gornit (spelling?) 
in Ocean of Tears drops all sorts of toes that we magicians need.  Visit 
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ and look in the bestiary section for more 
data about Gornit.  He can be heavily camped.

Hope this has been of some use!
