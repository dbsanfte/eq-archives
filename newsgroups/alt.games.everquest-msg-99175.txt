I think you're wrong.

There's a saying that goes something like, "For every good product
experience, the consumer will tell 1 other person.  For every bad
product experience, the consumer will tell 7 other people."  (I
don't know the exact numbers, but you get the point.)

Complaining in a newgroup about program bugs or imbalance or whatever
gets your message to a lot more than 7 people.  There's a good
chance lots of new "EQ-curious" people visit this newsgroup every
day, and what they see here could easily be a large part of the
deciding factor as to whether or not they buy EQ.

In fact, years back, the UO newsgroup alone convinced me to avoid
UO (when pk'ing was really bad -- not sure if it still is).

I also think that some of Verant's employees probably do read this
newsgroup.  Hopefully they see frustrated complaints and adjust
their priorities as a result.

: Of course there are repeat customers
: but it sounds to me like you all bitch about the programming on the usenet then
: tell all your friends how cool the game is.

I haven't recommended EQ to any of my friends.  Not because I
dislike EQ or think it's unplayably buggy (I don't), but because
I think it's dangerously addictive, and I don't want to be
responsible for introducing them to a possible unfortunate
addiction.  :)

: The fact of the matter is, the only thing that will change the patch procedure
: is money.

And complaints about problems on usenet probably do affect
Verant's income, as I demonstrated above.

: If Verant sees a tremendous amount of accounts being cancelled after
: a patch that gets botched, they might just change their procedure.  Of course,
: the rest of us who wait 1 extra day to play again will be the ones to see the
: change. :)

Fortunately, I'm not "into" EQ so much that I panic when the
servers are down for a day (or even two or three).  But at the
same time, I think all those annoying complainers serve an
important and valuable purpose.

Anyone who advocates NOT complaining is a foolish consumer.
(Okay, the exception being, people complaining about things
that aren't *really* problems!)
