I posted this earlier in another thread but I don't see where they
said that everything in the expansion would be instanced dungeons for
5 or 6 people. Hell, even if they did there hasn't been an expansion
with decent dungeons since Velious. Crystal Caverns, ToFS, Dragon
Necroplois, Kael and Siren's Grotto all had the nice dungeon feel to
it but what have you had since then? Luclin had Acrylia Caverns that
nobody went to because they forgot to itemize it and Akheva which was
pretty worthless for anything resembling a dungeon crawl. PoP (at
least through tier 3) is the ultimate in boring, single-pull outdoor
zones with the possible exception of Crypt of Decay which they screwed
up for crawling by blocking off half of it behind a raid mob. LoY
seems to strike a pretty good balance, plenty of spots to solo (with
some prime solo spots to lvl 65) , decent drops off of boss mobs that
a good group can do, and at least one zone that's fun to crawl through
(Hate's Fury).

I think one of the biggest benefits is that they can tune the dungeon
to the level of the group going in. IE: change the spawns to higher
level mobs for a group of 65s as opposed to a group of 55s heading
into the same dungeon. You should be able to make a lot more triggered
events in the dungeons. Rescue an NPC, conversation triggers,
mini-ring events when you walk into a room.
