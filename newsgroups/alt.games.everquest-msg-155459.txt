OK Where are all the Beastlords I wanna hear there input on our pets now they
wont Zone with us and we need spells to summon our fully buffed pets rather
than having the ability and then the buffs to buff it. I mean I dont mind a
spell to summon our pets but not zoning with us that was the Key thing that I
think drew alot of people to play beastlords, that and fact that they still
dont procure there spells like they should. Any Other Comments...

Magicians:
Hey With PoP us mages get to Summon Fishing poles and new spells for lvl 61-65
that are same as level 1-60 but stronger lines Gee Masters of summoning and
Damage Only get so many spells then they go variations on it- How about a
Summoning Spell to Summon A item to increase/restore our Hpst we can summon
monsters that are our pets in disguise we can damage ourselves for mana regen
we can deal damage we can Call of hero Groupmates and we can summon food drink
ale armor Limited Weaponry pets give us something...

Necros-
How about Changing the pet line  not the pets but say a zombie pet for lvl 1-20
a skeleton from 21-40 a spectre from 41-50 lich or darker undead mob 51-60+

All and all this is gonna be last expansion before eq2 comes out shouldnt they
listen to us the players I mean Beta Testers so they know how to ignore eq2
players

And Add another zone for high levels where they can make money and leave our
HGs Alone. Lol
