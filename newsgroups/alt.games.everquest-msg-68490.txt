Good thing to know...my 3rd computer is going to be identical (except P3,
not P2) as of tonight when I do a bunch of video card swapping. <g>

And, like others, I think it's great to see you on the forums.  The official
announcement was HR-speak for "he didn't exactly go willingly," but no
matter what the negative side of the story (if you were to believe it, which
I don't) it was always obvious to me that you love the game.
