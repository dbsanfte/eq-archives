"Doco"? Anyway, that's interesting, considering that I'm pretty sure 
they bill on the same day every month.

If you are at any time compelled to slander the company, I'd say you are 
generally dissatisfied. Otherwise, I'd maybe your "venting" is a bit 
unwarranted.

So now, by questioning your comparisons, I'm being obtuse? You "hold no 
problems with AOL and never did", yet support a reference to them in a 
comparison to what's wrong with SoE. That's either a very poor example 
or hypocracy.

What you paid and what you paid *for* are too closely related here to 
seperate them, as the old saying goes, "You get what you pay for." It 
doesn't mean that you pay for 99.9% uptime so you should get it. It 
means that you get an amount of uptime worthy of a $14.95 subscription 
cost. You obviously agree with that rate, as you continue to pay it.

Enjoy...until the next system hiccup, I guess. ;)
