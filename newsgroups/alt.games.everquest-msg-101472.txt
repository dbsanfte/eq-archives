Chimp with Uzi thinks: "Hail a Cazel! Safety off, squeezing trigger...not
pulling. Short, sharp controlled bursts....."

Cazel says: "You call that an Uzi? Now this is an Uzi..."

Jebober /em "Sighs dejectedly."

    *Your faction with Cazel's foot could not possibly get any better*
    *Your faction with the Laws of Norrathian Physics could not possibly get
any worse*
    *Your faction with your pet has gotten worse*
    *Your faction with amused onlookers has gotten better*
    *loading, please wait.......*


A KindlyCleric tells: "Lol - that was funny - do you realise har far you
slid down that  dune? Btw - want a Res?"

Chimp with Welts tells: "Would you like a stack of peridot?"

A KindlyCleric tells: "Ahh - I see your not as silly as I first
observed...."
