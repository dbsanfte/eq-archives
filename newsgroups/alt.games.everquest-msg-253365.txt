Yet another dude speak for "owned" (along with ownz, pwnz, ownd, pwnd, 
ownzrd, etc). As in 'I owned you'... which is more or less 'I beat you 
soundly, loser.'

The 'p' is next to the 'o' on the keyboard, so its an 'accidental typo' 
that' happened so often and so prominently that's become part of the 
slang. Sort like 'psot' for 'post'.
