I'd be more inclined to say the opposite. Do you know how many people
I knew (who had computers) ten or so years ago used OS/2?

One. And he was the biggest computer geek I knew. Most of the rest
probably never even heard of OS/2.

Do you know how many of those same people were using W95 a couple
years later?

I can't say I remember any of them NOT using it.

Perhaps you and the others here are hung up on just the technological
differences. The bunch of you sound like CS majors. You were too close
to tthe action so to speak to see where I am coming from with this.

Yes it was (W95). 

Another example that follows nicely: the rts genre was for the most
part created by two revolutionary games, Warcraft and C&C. They
weren't the first rts though; a game called Dune 2 was quite similar
and predates them by a year or two.

But Dune 2 was never popular and certainly would never have created
the monster genre that exists today. The two that would did have some
(most maybe) of their ideas based in it, but it was they that were the
ones that pushed the explosion. They were the revolution.

OS/2 was Dune 2. No one knew or cared about it besides the hardcore
fans.

W95 was WC/C&C. Ultra popular and so dominant the genre has only moved
incrementally forward since then (evolutionary).


One mroe example, which is actually very close to where the subthread
started. MUDs have been around a long time. Even had some graphical
MUDS showing up what, seven years ago or so?

UO and EQ were based on these in the same way W95 was based on OS/2 -
the lineage is obvious. But UO and EQ were a revolutionary step up,
which is why they have hundreds of thousands of users and the most
popular MUD ever has a tiny percentage of that.


Isn't it possible some of you are just speaking from an anti-MS
viewpoint? It is chic to do so, after all.
