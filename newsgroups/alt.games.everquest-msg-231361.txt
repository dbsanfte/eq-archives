Sorry, but that falls right in the same category as saying it's okay
to train, KS, and be a general ass to people if you're roleplaying an
evil character.

In other words, it's a lame excuse and gives REAL roleplayers a bad
reputation. Going up to everyone you see and saying "Can I have some
plat or gear?" isn't roleplaying a beggar. Roleplaying a beggar would
more appropriately be asking for a few copper or some food, as one
poor enough to be a beggar wouldn't be concerned with acquiring armor
and weapons. ><
