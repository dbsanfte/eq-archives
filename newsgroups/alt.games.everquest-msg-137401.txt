Remove the Win modem and replace it with a Hardware modem. Win modems use
software to emulate the chipset found on hardware modems so are cheaper and
are fine for email and web browsing. Win modems are totally unusable for
games as the software emulation uses a lot of system resource and as soon as
EQ starts pushing a lot of data around the processor starves the modem which
then can't cope and will drop you.

If you can, get an external modem as I have found these are better than PCI
modems but in saying that one of my machines uses a PCI 56k without problem.
