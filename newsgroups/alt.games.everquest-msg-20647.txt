Stupid is as Stupid does. 

IQ or success is no measure of how stupid a person is. Albert Einstein
could not go the store with a shopping list and come home with the
right items. If you saw him muddling through the store, you would
think he was stupid. 

Anyone who would name himself "Bill Gates" in EQ is a total idiot,
(Even Bill Gates himself.) That's like hanging a "Kick-Me" sign on
your own back.

You will have to come up with a better analogy. You are only proving
the "Idiot" point.
