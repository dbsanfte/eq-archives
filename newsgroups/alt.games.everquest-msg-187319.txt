Doesn't surprise me that a Shammy can solo there, but I just wouldn't have
expected it (and have never seen one doing so).

The other one that I didn't mention is Rangers, who can and do bow kite
there, though I have no idea what level they can effectively start to do so
(would guess low to mid 50's).
