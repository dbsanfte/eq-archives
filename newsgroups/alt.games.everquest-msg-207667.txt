I had video lag that degraded my run speed (wolfform) after patching.
Rebooting made it go away.  The evidence is, as usual with computer
problems, insufficient for a firm diagnosis.  But it appears to me
that the patcher hoses my system even more than the game client (I
can zone 10 to 40 times before I have to reboot, depending on the
zones and their player population).
