You'll easily be able to afford full bronze for well under 300pp - the 
traditional price for Bronze is 2pp per AC.  Be sure to get the medium 
instead of the Large, though - Bronze is very heavy, and even the medium 
will take up most of your 133 STR (hence the reason for its cheap price).  
It drops off mobs in various places; your best bet is to advertise in East 
Commonlands for the various pieces.  Bronze is the next step up from 
banded, having several more AC on each piece.

Next is Fine Plate, which is the same thing as Fine Steel by the way.  The 
confusion arises because most of the pieces are titled Fine Plate but on a 
few of the pieces they messed up and titled it Fine Steel; often people 
call it Fine Steel Plate.  There is also Steel armor which is sold at metal 
armor vendors - this has less AC than Fine Plate, costs incredible amounts 
of money, and is not to be confused with Fine Plate.

Fine Plate is several stone lighter each piece than Bronze, has several 
more AC than Bronze, and can be dyed different colors.  Blacksmiths make 
it, and it does not drop from any mobs.  Again, your best bet is to auction 
in EC.  You'll want medium rather than Large, once again.  It is 
considerably more expensive than Bronze because of the costs and time 
involved in making it.  There are armor pieces for all but the earring and 
ring slots.

The next step up from that is Crafted, which is quested from the Centaurs 
in South Karana (they are not crafted by players).  There are two sizes of 
Crafted, there is normal and Small.  The large races can wear the normal.  
Crafted has several more AC per piece than Fine Plate, and various stats as 
well.  You can begin to quest for this stuff pretty soon now, and should be 
able to get most of your pieces by your mid twenties.  The main cost for 
Crafted is for the gems you must give to the centaur for the piece, 
typically 100pp or 200pp or so worth of gems per piece.  Crafted is overall 
good enough armor that Warriors tend to keep it until they replace it with 
Planes armor in their late 40s.  However, there are pieces only for the 
visible slots (bracer, breastplate, legs, arms, helm, gauntlets and boots), 
so you will want to find other armor for the remaining slots (Fine Plate is 
good if your goal is AC).  Crafted is about the same weight as Fine Plate.
