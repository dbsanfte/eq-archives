How high can you level in the overthere?  I was getting Decent EXP last night
with jus tme, a 38 cleric, and a 37 monk.  I would just stun the tougher mobs
and let him beat on them, and between his mend skill and my using good mana
conservation skills when healing we were able to kill about 15 things before I
had to rest for mana and he would need a new SOW once ina while.  Got 3 yellow
bubbles in under 2 hours, which seemed REALLY good to me.  
     Now I'm 2 blue bubbles from 39 and I just HAD to log last night so I'll be
into 39 tonight.  So my question is how long can I keep this up for in this
zone. Or do I need to upon reaching 40 head somewhere else to rapid fire
through that hell level. I'm used to hell levels taking me 2 weeks to complete.
