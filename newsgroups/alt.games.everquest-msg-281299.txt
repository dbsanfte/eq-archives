Yes, that's the state of the game in a nutshell, nowadays.  The
Tutorial seems to reflect this "blitz the lower levels" attitude,
because gtting to level 10 is like clicking your fingers. I have to
say the Tutorial was pretty interesting though, simply because (and
TAKE NOTE, SONY!!) it was fresh, new and (for once) it was for
low-level players.

When I got to PoK, I just couldn't face Paludal Caverns yet AGAIN, and
actually sent an ooc out asking if anyone knew of some other place to
go to  :D  It's as you say - hit Tutorial/Kurns/PC/DSP and ignore the
rest.  The other zones for characters of appropriate levels may as
well not exist.

At a tangent whilst not quite unrelated, one guy in PoK did a mini
quest early this week. He said he was going to be in a particular
zone, which his friend would give a clue to after he'd left, and first
player under 20 to find him got 15k.  He duly left, and his pal then
announced the clue:  "He's beside the Shady Swashbuckler!"  Some
baffled people in PoK were saying things like "Is this in a new zone?"
and "What expansion is this zone in?"  Good lord, I remember when this
was the most famous NPC in Everquest, heh.  The only movement in the
zones now is people using the Magus, and there ain't a group in sight.
