Backstab works by targeting an NPC, gettin anywhere in the rear of it, and
hitting the button if you are in mormal melee range.

Best weapons.. do weapons searches on EQ'lizer or similar, and decide on
what you like .. fast or hard hitting. I chose fast.

Strength is what I have built as my primary attribute, it seems to plug
directly into how much damage your backstab does.
Dex I made secondary.. as some weapon procs are good to have go off now and
then :)

Like any melee type, as skills go up, so does the damage you do once past
20th.

I currently hit for 30's average with a best backstab of 199 (should break
200 soon) .. I use a slime coated harpoon primary and serrated bone dirk
secondary (like engulfing darkness for the runners)
