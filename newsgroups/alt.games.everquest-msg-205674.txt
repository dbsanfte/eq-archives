Yesterday, my group contacted an enchanter who was LFG for a Plane of Storms
group and we were turned down with "I only group in Bastion of Thunder."
For the life of me, I just don't understand the XP>fun attitude that the
powergamers have.

Lets just all skip the 150+ zones of content so we can grind and grind and
grind in one zone.  I must be missing something important that makes me not
want to do the same thing day in and day out.
