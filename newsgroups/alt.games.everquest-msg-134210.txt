Since the last really big crackdown on owning weapons in Briton (and
Australia) you are twice as likely to be mugged in London as in New
York or Chicago.  Source:  BBC news.  
Gun control laws are written by people who know nothing about guns and
gun safety.  Suppose you had a speed limit of 35 mph in your town and
teenagers were driving 80 mph down main street.  Your answer: lower
the speed limit to 20 mph.  Exactly the same approach as most all gun
laws.  Face it criminals don't obey laws.  That's why they are
criminals.  Gun laws only disarm the honest people.
