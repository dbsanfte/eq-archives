Ithvol wouldn't let me start the quest at 14, but I thought
perhaps I could get around that.  Turned in two bonings to "Slug"
(in Slugs tavern downstairs) and he did indeed give me the crate
to take to Dragoon Szorn.

Ran there last night and he wasn't in his spot.  It was very late
so I just logged out.  Checked again this morning and he was up,
to my relief. But when I handed him the crate he ate it and made
disparaging remarks about how much hate I had!  Hated him just
then thats sure as Innoruuk.    So much for getting around the
level restriction.

Off to Kurns where I did the next couple levels quickly enough,
camping the Fallen Crusader.   Only popped him once, this quest
is going to take forever.

So, back to Slug with more bonings, then back to LFay (the LOY
map function makes finding these spots tons easier, and whenever
I had to go to a spot thats not on the map, I just added it in
for later use)  Szorn was still up, so I got his Reciept and the
mission to Steamfont, hadn't gotten one faction hit in the
intervening time, so it must have been the level thing I'd heard
about.

Went to Steamfont and found Ennixy as the walkthru said, not on
my map but she is now.  Used the trigger phrase to spawn the
crusader, then logged out.  Logged in my bard, ran him over (WC
EC Nek POK Steamfont... could have put him in place in the first
place but walkthru said 10 minutes or more till crusader shows up
anyway).  Now the marked map was handy, since it showed just
where to go, I'd wondered if map notes were consistent from one
character to the next.

Crusader was already there, quite near the gnome, apparantly they
aren't KOS to each other; I'd been worried she might KS me like
some other quest givers try to do.  He attacked my bard
immediately despite his green to level 57 status.  Halfway thru
the fight he LOH'd himself back to full, but other than that it
was a straightforward fight.  I didn't have melee songs loaded
but melee'd anyway to see how it would go, he took down about a
fifth of my HP total which I thought was pretty impressive for a
level 27 or so mob... or more to the point, speaks very poorly to
a 57 bard's ability to mitigate damage.

Faction hits were all "can't get any worse" for me, apparantly as
I'd thought all ones bottomed out by hunting in POG already.

Logged shaman back in, looted crate and head and a fier dal
longsword (6/28, ooooh).  Back to LFay, hand in the crate and get
Voucher, then gate back to Nektulos.  Ran in to 3rd gate, used
Ant potion again, and handed in reciept, voucher,and head and my
disciple symbol to get Regent symbol.

Put the Clinging Darkness on myself and timed it, duration is
about 40 seconds, so my cleric can stop fretting about wishing he
were a Dark Elf.  Tactically snare should still be useful, but
not for serious fear kiting, which is what I always thought
about.  Snare mob, stick fear,and you only have about 25 seconds
left before having to reapply snare!  Fine perhaps on low level
mobs, but solo cleric killing stuff at higher levels takes a lot
longer than 40 seconds per kill.

Went out and used it on some halflings, and even here its a bit
touchy; six second casting time gives them some time to run
before it sticks; one even ran far enough to be out of range
before it cast!  Also, because green mobs run with lots of HP
left, the snare wasn't always enough to actually stop them
moving.

This strikes me as more useful in a group situation, or with a
pet, where I can cast the snare before the mob quite gets to the
"run away" point.

I'll report more once I've used it in more serious situations

Paak, 16 shaman Regent of Innoruuk, Morel Thule

ps oh, and once I got a fourth Amulet of Woven Grass I went back
in and got another Initiate's Symbol, so I can compare range of
Weaken with Clinging Darkness for pulling purposes
