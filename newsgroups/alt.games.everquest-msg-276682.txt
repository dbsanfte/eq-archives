Maybe you got lucky.  My guildie was trying to do the turn in for the
1.5 battle (Earthshaker IIRC, in RCoD) and the mob never spawned.  She
/petitioned it.  It was answered the next day to the effect of "Sorry"
and that she will have to redo the entire 1.5 from start.  She sent an
email to SoE and still haven't gotten response yet.

It could depend on the cause of the bug, whether the log provided clue
or not and how detailed the petition was.  I doubt the GM would answer
if someone claimed to have lost a blade of carnage but never provide
details.  And I doubt if it was destroyed accidently would get it
replaced especially if you have fast destroy on.
