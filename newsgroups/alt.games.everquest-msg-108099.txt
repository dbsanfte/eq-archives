If you think Valor is a buff... well you are in good company, but like the
infamous pally hat "DW helm" this is really a clickable heal in disguise.

I suspect, frankly, that the 2 AC, amounting to more like 5 AC, will reduce
my damage taken by more than 35 points over enough blows to kill me from
something small, and that neither will do me a bit of good against some of the
"500 a shot quad hits" mobs, where its just a race between the mob and my
speed at hitting that DA button.

As a pathetic 56 lowbie, I'm still good for 3Khp on the hoof when buffed up
with Aego and my own Armor of the Faithful.  I like hp, don't get me wrong...
but look at the difference between donals legs and thurg legs, and you can
see why I expected something a lot more exciting from the arms.
