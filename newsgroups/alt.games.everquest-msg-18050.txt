I did lvl 30 pretty fast on the ledge in OT.  You could run there mostly
invis and bind near the FM zone line. You may run into problems getting
a group, being a wizard, but if you can get into a few good, steady
pulling groups it will go by quickly enough.  Loot is crap but the xp
can really pour in there with a good group with an alert, competent
puller.
