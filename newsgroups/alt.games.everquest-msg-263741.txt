We recently had to DL the entire client again, and since I was patching two 
machines, even a 3.5g network file transfer takes some time so I burned it 
to CDs for my 2nd machine. Took 6 CDs, and note that this is the beta client 
that is probably missing some of the final artwork, sounds, music, 
installers and other associated stuff that will probably ship on the final. 
My guess is that will wind up at least 7 CDs, and I wouldn't at all be 
surprised at 10. Fortunately, I ordered the DVD version.
