Would it really work though? 

Wouldn't some quests be 'better' than others. A choice between a good 
quest and a crappy one isn't really a choice. A choice between two 
equivalent quests begs the question: why have two equivalent quests.

If the quests were interlinked to form 'paths' so you could take one of 
two or three or more paths, that might be interesting, but ultimately is 
no different than going to another newbie area...  and eventually the 
paths will be exhausted.

Oh, and I hate most repeatable quests. I despise those that are used to 
PL XP (tumpy tonics (does that still work?) Kaladim bone chips... 
others. For consumable items sure I can live with that, especially if 
the quest makes sense... I need this to make some X, you can have some X 
if you bring me some Y. 

For faction... mmm...still not impressed... Trooper Mozo and I are on 
very good speaking terms, but I can't stand the sight of him.

Interesting, and borne out in DAoC you say? (Never played that one.) 
Still you only said 'early' DAoC... what happened? Did common sense 
eventually take hold of camp claiming or did the designers further 
interfere??

/shrug

Inferrence by definition is to "conclude from evidence" or "reason from 
circumstance". That pretty much is exactly what I did. That you didn't 
intend it doesn't invalidate the inference. It may have been the wrong 
conclusion, but it wasn't an irrational or unjustifiable one.

OK. Still, I see the original point that DAoC had some good ideas that 
we haven't seen further refined, irresepective of the fact that DAoC is 
heavily derivative of EQ.

PS re your moving on from EQ: best of luck in whatever you pursue. This 
place won't be the same without you.
