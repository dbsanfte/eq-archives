This is a question more out of curiousity since I don't play a melee.  A
friend got a 2 damage aug for his rogue with his LDoN points.  I don't
remember what the weapon stats were before and after the aug, but let's say
it was 15dmg/21dly before and 17dmg/21dly after.  I asked what exactly that
2 dmg would mean - is it simply an extra 2 points to every hit (doesn't seem
tremendously meaningful).  He started talking about it and I soon realized
that he didn't realize exactly what it meant either, but he was really
excited to get the augment.  Then the next dungeon he said the aug had
boosted his backstab from frequently hitting in the 400 range to 650, which
seemed to me to be a bit far-fetched, but, again, I don't play a melee so
I'm in the dark.  What does that 2 dmg aug really do?  TIA.
