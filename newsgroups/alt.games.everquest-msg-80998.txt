I like doing oddball faction questing.  Check this
out:

Yup, that's a dwarven Paladin standing next to
Perrir Zexus, the level 60 (at least) head of the
Neriak Cleric's guild (on the Priests of Innoruk
faction).  In the screenshot I'm doing a celebratory
spellcast, I just became non-KoS to them two nights ago.

I know that lots of people quest for good faction
with groups that originally were KoS to them, but
trust me, this one was even trickier than it looks.  :-)

And I'm still at Allied status with the Priests of
Life, Priests of Marr, and Clerics of Tunare, which
are the opposing factions.
