50k plat is also 0.15 of a Sceptre of Destruction, 0.2 of a
Spirit-Wracked Urn MQ, 0.42 Horns of Hsgara, 0.5 of a fungi, 0.56
cloaks of flames, 0.95 Trakanon breastplates, 1.67 tranquil staffs, 2
Robe of the Kedge MQs, 2.5 glittering rings of judgement, 3.15
Heraldic Greaves, 10 Froglok Bonecaster Robes, 12.5 Lamentations, 100
Centi Longswords, 1,000 10 pound Halas Meat Pies, 2,500 leather
padding, 5,000 Heady Kiolas, 12,500 spiderling silks or some
combination thereof.

The more you level, the easier plat farming becomes. The last time I
needed to raise 100k plat quickly, I hunted in Scarlet Desert and
Droga. I wound up raising the 100k in eight days like so:

 14,681 cash drops
 18,553 vendor drops
 29,400 sunstones, 147 @ 200 plat each
  5,000 mind melts, 4 @ 1250 each
 11,575 green goblin skins, 41 @ 50, 127 @ 75
 18,525 Mt. Death Mineral Salts, 247 @ 75
  7,250 Idols of the Thorned, 2750, 2500, 2000
  9,250 Random Drops
  2,650 Previous Inventory
