Gods, pre-16 is hell (well, comparatively speaking) for an enchanter.
Crappy pet, crappy offense, damned hard to find a group unless they're
hunting in a zone where multi-pulls are common...and that's just not likely.
The easiest way to level if you have to solo is just root/nuke like any
other caster with root.  Oh, and lots of small daggers.  Lots.  But once you
have Breeze?  Well, let's just say that at 51 I really have no intention of
buying my enchanter T-boots or quest for J-boots.   A 10-dose SoW potion
lasts me a couple months, when you taken into consideration grateful druids
and shaman.  Heck, to date I've gotten 2 10-charge potions free from
grateful shaman (unsolicited).

Only that you're less likely to group with enchanters at 30 than you are at
40+.  At least, that's what it was like on my server (The Rathe then
Zebur0xx0r).

Nah, all I meant was there's NO thinking involved while playing a wizard
beyond remembering to mem up the correct types of damage spells, and
remembering not to over-nuke.
