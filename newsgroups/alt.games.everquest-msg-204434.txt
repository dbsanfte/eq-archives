Which goes a long ways towards explaining why so many veteran players
(myself included) are having a blast playing on Stromm where the
Bazaar is not yet "mature".  It's actually pretty cool to be hunting
and questing gear as a guild thru the 20s, 30s, and 40s (guild I'm in
is currently L37 to L47).  Hopefully the fun will continue as we move
into our 50s and the pace slows because we'll have to raid for gear and
group for xp instead of grouping for both.
