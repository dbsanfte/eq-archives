Nice try, but no go.  If you can't  effecitvely debate what I said,
spare me the hyperbole.

Yes.

No.  Your statement above is not the same as my statement.  Nice try,
but again no go.  Please try not to be so transparent about twisting
my words.

I have, repeatedly.  You just didn't want to acknowledge those parts
of my messages.

Are you incapable of arguing anything without twisting my words around
to change their meaning?

No, "we" are not,  try to pay attention.  You and I have been
discussing your mistaken belief that anti-discrimination laws are
"special rights" laws.   Further, we have been discussing how you are
unable to justify that in the general case- other than  justifying
your position with a single example of a law which is not in effect.
That was followed by much sputtering on your part, but you still
showed no  practical reason to block these laws, while I gave numerous
practical "real world" reasons why they are needed and useful-
including ways in which they have been directly beneficial to me.  You
failed to refute these reasons (other than be re-iterating the same
statements as before).  Finally, you failed to make any defence to my
assertion that by voicing baseless opinions about "special rights" you
and those with the same opinions have made it harder for me to live my
life with the full freedoms, benefits, and responsibilities I would
enjoy under a fully applied law against discrimination based on sexual
orientation.

Its been fun, and you have added a bit of insight to my observations
of "bigots in action", but you're lying to yourself if you think you
brought any substantive arguments to this thread.
