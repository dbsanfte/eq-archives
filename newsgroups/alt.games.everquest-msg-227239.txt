The most important points I made on our guild board during a recent 
discussion -

1.  The system *must* be zero sum over the long haul.  
2.  Award of RPP must be above the ability of anyone to tamper with.

I did a check of our last 3 weeks of raiding (at that time) and 
we came very close to RPP in balancing RPP out (there was a net
out).

In our guild you can only earn RPP on scheduled raid nights, any
PU raids that other people put together (we do a lot of AM 3 group
raids) the RL sets up the loot scheme - no RPP earned, no RPP 
spent.
