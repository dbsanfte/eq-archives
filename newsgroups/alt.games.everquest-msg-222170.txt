I'd guess that if anyone tested it, they would find you are right.  Your
way, whenever a mob is doing damage, it has the whole group's attention.
The other way, mobs are doing damage while not receiving the whole group's
attention.  Your way, each mob will output less damage, since it spends less
time in damage output mode, and so less healing will be required.
