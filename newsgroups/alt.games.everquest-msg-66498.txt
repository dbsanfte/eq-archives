First, their server software (other than the patch server) doesn't care
about graphics.   That's easily proven simply by watching any mob path
through buildings and over/through trees.   Along the same lines, the
only possible impact upgraded player computers are having would be a
tiny increase (relatively) in communication speed and, given the wide
availability of broadband, that's hardly relevant.

Second, that's pretty obvious.   Look at all the computers with the Intel
chipset(s) that were broken.   How long would that have taken to find?
It's also rather obvious that beta testers, for the most part, aren't the
people running three-year-old HP PCs.

Third, any software professional will tell you *every* piece of software is
released ahead of when it should be, unless it's trivial.   There's simply
no
substitute for putting real life load on servers or for putting real life
idiots
in front of the monitor/keyboard.

That said, any release that breaks "minor" things like bard songs is hard to
believe.  Bards aren't druids, but didn't *anyone* think to test them?
