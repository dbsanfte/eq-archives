How about the ability to cast FD on your party members.  It would be the 
equivalant of a Monk going over and smacking them up along side the head.  Say 
the MT goes down and the mob starts taking out everyone else the monk can run 
over to the cleric and FD her/him by knocking them out.  Then when the mob 
leaves the cleric can get up and rez the dead.  Or it would be useful on raids 
to help on a huge wipe.
