Actually, I use the exact opposite approach.  The spawn poins seem to be 
about 100-150 units of the top end of the ramp, so I follow the wall 
from GD zone, walk right up the edge of the ramp until it looks safe 
enough to slide down it, then run across and up the other side, back 
toward kael along the ledge, then continue south.  Either way works 
though.
