It's kinda sad really. I always carry a stack of dots around and give one
whenever I'm buffed with something that requires it in group and they seem
surprised more often than not. A cleric a couple of weeks ago told me he
didn't ask for dots or money to cover them because his group members said
"they were too poor". Ironic really! :)

I don't see anything wrong with you taking a cut out of the split in LDoN to
cover your dots. I've been in a group with a cleric who did that and it
seemed reasonable enough for me. Hate to think how many those folks must
burn if you have a group wipe or two and require em all over again.
