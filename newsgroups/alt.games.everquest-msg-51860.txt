DAoC won't be the end of EQ.  However, it is what I consider the first
significant competition.  When it comes to two high quality titles like
this, the argument over which game is "better" is silly.

Many DAoC players seem to hold some sort of animosity toward EQ as if VI
forced them to play this game that they hated for so long and now they are
finally *free* and can move on.  Many EQ players seem to hold some sort of
animosity toward DAoC players because they are splitters of some sort.

I would recommend players of either game to try the other.

Best Regards
