Heh, they added L1 pets to the game some time ago.  Of course, even
before they nerf'd L1 - 9 into oblivion it didn't exactly take a
long time to make L4, can't imagine anybody buying the spells except
as a novelty.  [iirc, they even added a special rule for the L1 pets:
HP buffs don't stick to pets with less than 20hp.]

Oh, and cheapest Preservation II item is the Fine Antique Ring (PoK
quest:  High Quality Cougarskin, Undead Froglok Tongue, Cockatrice
Beak, Tiny Rockhopper Eye, buy Cougarskin and Beak in bazaar for <=
10pp each, find Tongue and Eye on vendor or in bazaar for <= 1pp).
Ring has 3ac 30hp 20mana and Mana Preservation II.
