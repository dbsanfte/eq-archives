All you casters complaining about KEI no longer available sub 46, well
that's nothing....They nerfed my LoY weapons!
Ok I knew it said it was happening but I figured they would just change the
drops not actually nerf all the weapons out there! My Zraxthil Forged
Flamberge is now 9/35 and my Luggald Dagger is now 5/20, FFS!
The game is now unplayable for my 13th level Ranger, wtf am I supposed to
do?

Ok, so I just replaced them but that cost me my entire 120pp of
savings...and tbh 5/20 still isn't a bad ratio at that level but I replaced
it with an Elder Owlbear beak and on the plus side managed to get a Naths
GSwd for 75pp 17/30...Ideal! :ï¿½) and I'll need to sell my Runic Carver now
to get a 1hs, thinking maybe Coterie LS 7/23 wouldn't be too shabby for me.

/boggle at the amount of Coterie Longswords I've let rot on Bristlebane
