You don't appear willing to give them the choice, denigrating anything
that doesn't maximize your efficiency.

Strawman. More accurately, it is the mindset that despite someone else
putting in more effort, you should still get the same rewards just
because in your opinion your time is worth more.

Who's the elitist again?

In practice, the most elitist people in the mmorpg gaming universe
are, in fact, the casual powergamers. They want everything handed to
them on a silver platter. Walking to another zone is too much of a
pain! It interferes with efficiency! It would be much easier if the
requested mobs would just spawn nicely, one by one, right in front of
the character, preferably in a private zone. Then they can grab all
the loot they can get without having to bother with all those "being a
part of a world" issues....

Another strawman and a bifurcation fallacy to boot. Nowhere was it
suggested that EQ should have stayed in its earlier state either. This
is not an "either or" situation.

What does my opinion of myself, whatever that might be, have to do
with anything? Utterly irrelevant.

Development of mmorpgs has always been a seesaw battle between forces
along several axes, the roleplayer vs the powergamer, the casual gamer
vs the hardcore gamer, the PvPer vs the PvEer, even the mature vs the
juvy.

It's just the way these things work.

That is your perogative. Trade deadline day for me so I'm certainly
not going anywhere offline.
