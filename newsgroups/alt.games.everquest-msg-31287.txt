There are a few dungeons in the zone. Sol A and Nagafen's Lair (or Sol B)
for the higher levels, 35+ mostly. Also the Temple of Solusek Ro is there,
which is the main point for mid-level quests for most classes.

If you get up a few levels you might go for Najena. The highest mob there is
level 30 (and a lvl 40 spider, but almost nobody goes for that one) and it's
good hunting from lvl 18 or so.
