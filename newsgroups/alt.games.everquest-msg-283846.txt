Exactly  :)  Chorkie is possibly mistaken about mana-wastage when
interrupting a spell by moving about (I thought EVERYONE knew
about"duck" by about level 5, but there you go) - I wouldn't know, as
I never bother to move-interrupt... I may experiment though, heh.
Anyhoo, no mana whatsoever is wasted if the spell is interrupted by
"duck" which should keep upset casters everywhere a lot happier  :D
