Hi All,

Was chatting with a non-EQ friend. He knows I play and am an ... enthusiast.

Anyway, he had been reading about Verant's development of the Star Wars
MMORPG. He likes Star Wars and said he would give it a try.

We got into a discussion about player demographics. I talked about how the
whole D&D dragon slaying model was a nitch [sp] market and appealed to a
very specific group. However, even this 'nitch' has garnered Verant 300,000
players worldwide.

How will that translate to a more fully-developed environment like Star Wars
which has an established fanbase in the millions?

I have no interest in the AO universe because I think hard-core SF is silly.
Not nearly as mature as a Tolkienesque setting : P

However, I am a Star Wars fan and would love to play a Jedi Knight.

Will the world get sucked into the EQ lifestyle? Will jobs be lost,
marriages fail, education be discarded all for the sake of Clone Wars?

/em is frightened...and excited!

Drywit
