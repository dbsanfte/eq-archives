The pen & paper RPG Traveller had an interesting take on this. Essentially
you learned your skills as part of the process of rolling your character
(which a lot of D&D players thought took way to long) then during the course
of your adventuring if there was a need for a skill, you had it. Essentially
the player left the roll-up process (it was referred to as mustering out, as
I recall) a mature, complete character, ready to adventure with any group.
No worries about levels and leveling up, or dealing with the frustration of
being slaughtered by a rat when your buddy who started a few weeks earlier
was on a dragon raid.
