I started in Qeynor and started killing some monsters for some hours and
selling them to merchants. I now have 1 platinum, 126 gold, 203 silver, and
933 bronze. My items are a bastard sword, coterie garget and some boxes and
bags. Im wondering where i should go what i should buy etc.
Plz your help would be greatly appreciated!
Also i talk to people and most of them completely ignore me. Are most of
everquest players this snobby?
