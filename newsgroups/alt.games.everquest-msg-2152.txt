The 50+ people would probably have been camping Xalgoz for the HS key quest.

Kaesora was the first Kunark dungeon my group went to when Kunark opened and
we had a great time. We were all around level 40. There are some nice drops,
especially the Strathbone Shell Shield. I'd recommend the place for anyone
of the appropriate level as it's a nice, challenging, empty zone. And now
you can bind melees nearby as well.
