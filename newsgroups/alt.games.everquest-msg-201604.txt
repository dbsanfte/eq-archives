Not unless you cannot avoid it. Give us a list of your items (or a Magelo
Profile)
and maybe we can find some alternatives.

Better idea, see if you can improve your strength somehow without
sacrificing AC.

Normally, yes it does...the AC/HP part is the clincher on price tho.

AC...softcap for AC is around 1200 I believe (although there is also an
arguement that this no longer applies to PoP zones) so until you reach that
get AC, then look for HP/Stamina items.

Most people will tell you to ignore Strength but as I play a DE Warrior I
know exactly your problem, I imagine you are Elvish or Erudite in race to
have a weight problem.
Look at what you carry with you...can you shed some load or upgrade your Wt
Reducing items (EE Bag and Ralic Pack, maybe coin purse) I finally solved my
weight problems not with more strength but with BP and Greaves of Living
shadow...both weigh 0.1 when or if I upgrade these I shall no doubt have the
problem back again :ï¿½/
