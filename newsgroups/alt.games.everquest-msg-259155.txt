Keeper of Lost Things. I just saw him yesterday. I let a body rot with
a freeport guard's shortsword on it. (I was trying to get a rez) It's
been in Shadowrest almost since the place opened. I finally went to go
get it, because the annoying "You currently have a corpse in
Shadowrest" message was getting on my nerves.
