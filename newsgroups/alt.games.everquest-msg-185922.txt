Sometimes when the staff complain that they are overworked and need more
staff, management says "no". After all, if the staff are overworked,
management is getting better bang for their buck. It's extremely common
in professions where some of the payoff is the kick you get from helping
people. Nursing and teaching are the obvious examples, but it's true to
a lesser extent in other service professions.

So what are they supposed to do about it? Work less? That works for the
player base.

If you think that being constantly bitched at because of lousy service
when you're not only doing your best to give good service but working
unpaid overtime to do it is great fun... I suggest you try it some time.

I'm not saying that all the GMs are like this. However, I've seen enough
tales of *good* GM service here that I think we can be sure that *some*
of them are.
