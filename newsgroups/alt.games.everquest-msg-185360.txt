I like his latest update, especially in reference to the Crown of the Deceiver Quest

http://www.fohguild.org/flash/index.php

"IV. Find the guy responsible for the Wood Elf Illusion Crown Quest and beat the fuck out of him. There's nothing I enjoy more than
taking a twink to Guk, doing a /who and seeing 18 lvl 65 players AEing the fuck out of the dead side while little fucking Timmy the
lvl 42 paladin and his stalwart group of adventurers are left with dick in hand, crying their little eyes out. While you are beating
the stupid fuck that made this quest, just remember little Timmy. It'll fuel the rage. You turned a fantastic exp spot into a
fucking shitpool. What's next? The Ogre Illusion Cock Ring that requires positive faction with the gnomes in Sol A? What a stupid
fucking idea compounded by stupid fucking quest implementation. Make the faction its own damn faction that can only be obtained deep
in sebilis or some shit... I know Krup's and above in Sebilis are giving Frogloks of Guk faction, you're on the right track, now
change that faction to something else entirely so the shitheads can vacate Guk. Remember Timmy assholes..."
