Bard/Necro would be an interesting combo that I would like to
try. The necro dots and fear kites and the pet and bard attack from behind
with the bard singing dot song. Bard sings mana song and regen on the
necro between fights. Bard has some crowd control capability.

I think there would be almost zero downtime and constant killing
with this combo.
