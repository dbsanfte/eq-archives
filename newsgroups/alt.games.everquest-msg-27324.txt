Hehe well done.

I have been playing the game a long time and have quite a bit
of knowledge about zones and quests, etc. but I don't know
or memorize everything. So many of my in game friends ask
me about quests or items they find and I usually have no problem
giving them info and/or pointing them in the right direction. However,
one guy asked me about every freakin' piece of junk item he found.
"do you know what xxx is for?" "Do you know who to turn in gnoll
teeth to?" "how much is xxx worth? what should I sell/buy it for?"
I finally got fed up after his 20th tell to me in as many minutes when
I was in a hot group So I said "Look man I don't mean to be rude but
there are over 5000 items in this game and over 3000 quests, do
you think I have them all memorized?" Then he says "Well how am I
supposed to know what to do with xxx?",  "same way I do, look it up
on the web."  He never sends me a tell now until he is really stumped. =)
