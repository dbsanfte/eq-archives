Pal Cavern is a lousy place to get anything but EXP and bad habits. )

You are not a Cleric Lite, outdoors you are a great addition. Indoors
you add a lot to a party. Panic Animal with a snare, and people can
chase a red (animal) mob around beatring on it for good exp.

You can solo a lot too, and make cash that way.

Some people in Pal Cavern are of the
Crushbone-oasis-overthere-dreadlands set. Not too original with lots
of stupid misconceptions, they go there cause that is the "BEST" place
for this-or-that. I love those people because they avoid some really
great zones I can use without so much crowding...

Yeah tell them to quit being loot hogs. If they dont find another
group. Sometimes PC is real light on healers. Take advantage of that.

Not unless you turn /auto on. You tell them to keep it on if they are
not going to ALPHA loot.
