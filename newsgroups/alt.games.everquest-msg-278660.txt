Compared to the difference CHeal makes, the other differences
are relatively minor.   I doubt anyone can seriously argue THE
defining spell for an EQ cleric is anything other than CHeal.
Yes, they're better than other healers at earlier levels too, but
that difference is minor compared to the huge difference CHeal
makes even with vastly higher-level druids and shaman, let
alone comparable level druids/shaman.

I've not been paying much attention since EQ2 was released,
but I'd guess a 39 cleric can still cast a single heal for more
HPs than a 70 shaman, right?
