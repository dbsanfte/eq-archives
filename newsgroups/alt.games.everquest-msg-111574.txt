Believe it or not, my wizard made it through all of level 29 and most of
level 30, never going anonymous, and never porting *anyone* to anyplace.
(well, except myself, of course, but I'd been doing that for a while so
it doesn't really count.)

Then, on Sunday, our guild was having a blow-off-steam dueling event at
the arena giving out a few KPP in cash, FBSS, some other bank stuff for
prizes for the alts. Most of us, including my main were already there.
All the druids and wizards who had been porting were already there. One
guildie logged on late and was looking for a ride in /gu.

Nobody really wanted to go back, pick him up, and have to run all the
way back from NK to the Arena *again*. That's when I remembered... DOH!
I have a porter! Logged out and brought on the wizard. Gated to DL and
picked the guy up, memmed North Port, took him to NK so he could run to
the Arena.

I was getting ready to camp out, and the trade window opens. The guy
hands me a _diamond_! I was like, "Ummm... what's this for? I'm not
going to charge guildmates for a port."

/guildie_01 shrugs
"I got three in Seb last night. You may as well have one."

guildie_01 runs off to the bridge.

/em thinks to himself... "hrmmm... this porting thing might not entirely
suck after all."
