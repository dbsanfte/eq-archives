I think I had about 12 characters just get up to level 10 or so when I first
started.

For me it was that I hadn't found "my" class yet.  Everyone is different.  A
friend talked me into starting a druid and it turned out to be my favorite
class by far until the 40s.  Now my favorite class is enchanter, and I have
a 47 druid, and 46 enchanter.

Everyone is different.  I'm NOT suggesting either class...that would be a
stupid thing to do since I have no idea what "your" class might be.
