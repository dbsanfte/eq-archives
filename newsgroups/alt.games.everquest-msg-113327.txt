As for the whole druid debate going on..ah well, im not going there :)

My experience with the whole sow please goes like this:
I was in DC and a Lv6 i think it was wanted a sow at the entrance, he said
he was going to unrest! hmmm i thought, told him ok and warned him to follow
the water line fo you will frag your ass on the rocks with sow (im still
stupid enough to do it at Lv31, i dont see me learning anytime soon). So off
he goes straight through the middle! I send him a tell saying that if the
sow doesnt kill him the gobo's will, he sent me one back saying he knew what
he was doing, fair enough i thought i'll leave him to it.

About 5 minutes goes by and i am now in unrest and i get a tell from this
guy.

"drag my corspe to the zone i died because of your stupid sow blah blah
blah"

I tell him that i had warned him and i cant just leave where i am without
training the whole zone (my wolf form had gone BTW so getting back in the
tower could of been more difficult).

He rants on /ignore follows and i carry on with my hunting.

i guess some people just arnt happy what ever you do, i guess all you can do
is try your best sometimes :)
