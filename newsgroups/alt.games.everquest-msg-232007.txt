I had the impression Middle Earth's history and languages were both 
pretty gorily detailed before the books were actually written... one of 
the reasons why they are as good as they are... they genuinely have the 
sense of a story drawn out of a world... instead of much fantasy where 
the world is clearly written around the story. In Tolkien you get the 
sense there are many other tales to tell as characters that are barely 
touched on seem to 'exude' great depth though their parts in LotR is small.

Certainly LotR and the Hobbit have a different tone, and there are 
linguistic differences but they are remarkably cohesive.
