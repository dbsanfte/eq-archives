Hmm. I don't know if there are different versions of the Gold ediiton or
what, but both of the Gold editions that I purchased were identical in that
they contained 5 CDS that all linked together in one install process
spanning each of the 5 CDs. First you install Disc 1, then Disc 2 ... Disc
5, then insert Disc 1 and you're done, put away CDs forever. You then simply
register the one account key for the lot and you're in business with "All
Expansions Enabled" when you log on.

I think his problem is related to trying to install on top of the original
Classic installation. If I were him, I would simply uninstall the original
Classic, delete the folder, everything, and then install the entire Gold
edition into one folder. As you know, his character will still reside on the
server, all he will need to do is configure his interface once he logs his
character in. This approach eliminates most of the potential confusion
arising out of multiple directories, incompatible Classic versions, etc.
It's like a fresh install of Windows instead of upgrading on top of an old
install.
