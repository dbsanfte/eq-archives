The problem is that firstly of course you should remember that selling
your account is against the EULA.

secondly 46 and 35 while maybe have been tough for you to get there,
only accounts I know which sold had lvl 60+ characters on them.

If you could get your cleric its epic, you could probably sell it
maybe for a little, but,  probably not a huge amount.
