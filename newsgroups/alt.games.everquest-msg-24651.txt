To you I apologize... but seeing what I have from all (not a
generalization - all) of the people who've started to play, it is
reasonable to assume, that in order to attain any degree of success in
the game (and that is the point no?) one would have to spend a very
large amount time playing this. Recreational playing: sure no problem.
 Playing as though it is a career: even the most hardcore of you
probably know deep down inside, that they are better things to do, and
that the sheer number of hours played is probably indicative of a
greater problem in that persons life (can you say escapism?)
I apologize to anyone out there who is able to moderate the breadth of
gameplay (and therefore make a contribution to themselves, nevermind
society)
