Want to know my top pet peeve ?

This ...

"i know this has been asked b4 but im in need of some help . i recently
moved
and lost all my EQ CDs somewhere it kinda sucks . i have DLed the original
Everquest game from Sony but i cannot find a way to DL the expansions ..
Kunark Velious and PoP . please post here if u know how or where i can get
these files . TIA
Run" - quoted from message "DL'ing EQ please help."


Was this guy on some kind of time limit ? did he have a word limit ? was he
being chased by a mad man with a hatchet forcing him to have to type out his
message a quickly as possible ? I really doubt it.

So why in blue hell does he use "B4", "u", uncapitised "i", and only the
term "DL" and never once "Download" (you should at least point out to your
reader what DL stands for, even if it seem totally clear to yourself).

I can just about put up with text messages using this kind of lazy english,
and even in EQ if someone is in a real hurry to send me a message but for
f*ck sake theres a time and a place for it and THIS is not it !

If your going to beg (which is what hes doing) from people then atleast make
an attempt to look like you spent more than 2 seconds typing the message.
It really annoys the hell out of me when I'm playing EQ and I get someone
walk up to me and say "sow me plz" would it have killed them to spend the
split second longer typing out the whole freaking word ?

Even more annoying is when you help someone out and all they say is "Thnks",
Your just spent your own time helping out this guy your never met before,
for no charge, and maybe even used up some of your resources (mana, PP HP
all take time to get back) and they cant even be bothered to type one more
letter to thankyou ?!?

Grrrrrrr ...
