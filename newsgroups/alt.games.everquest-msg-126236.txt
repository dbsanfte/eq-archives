Rangers cannot fear giants AFAIK.

The fear-the-giants-into-the-pit trick isnt an exploit, because they do not
actually get stuck (they just tend to path downwards towards the center of
the pit, but on many occasions I have had them head the other way back
towards the ramp). There are no other mobs that path through that way, and
you will not get agro from the fort above you. IMO its the best place in the
zone to camp because you will only get adds that you bring (unless you get
some lameass kiting druid overpull, who decides to root one next to you
while you heal, in their rush to take down Gorgul - has happened to me on
many occasions, but im not bitter - honest)

Team up with a bard, and you should fly though them easily. The trick is
that when feared, they start running, but each consecutive connecting hit
makes them change direction. Getting too close to the other at the ramp?
Give it one whack, and watch it run the other way. Even better is to pull
back a little, get the bard to twist haste and fear, and you will be hitting
them fast enough to make them just keep turning in place. The loot is pretty
good, and Gorgul sometimes drops a treeweave tunic, which is good for any
non-twinked melee char - AC25, str +10 (a poor mans barbed ringmail).
