This is probably your best option right now. It will be less of a headache
in the long run.  You designate one person to loot (usually group leader)
with auto split off.  They loot every corpse.  At the end of the days
hunting that person goes and sells all the loot and then the coin is split
between all party members. If something drops that is a good item, either
use the need before greed idea or have those interested in it, roll for it.

At the ealier stages of the game, looting order and gaining coin is a pretty
big priority but as you level up, you will find it is much easier to get
loot and will not be as concerned with it.  I just hit 31 with my SK and am
finding that now I am not as worried about loot.
