Also, for the inevitable "but you raid hate and fear without repercussion"
arguements...

Hate and Fear are ruled by evil gods.  They expect you to come for
them.  Even though you worship them, they hate you.

It's like the Anti-Barney or something...
"I hate you , you hate me, we're Innoruk's fam-i-ly..."

Tunare is NOT evil and doesn't see why you'd come
to kill her or her groupies, hence the faction hosings.
