Well, if you're going to have any kind of permanent pet you use up
2 spell slots.  All the primary pet classes have the pet summon and
a pet haste/atk buff spell for it.

As for mana regen, I would go for the single fastest personal regen
and not worry about KEI or VoQ. 18 mana per tick from VoQ versus
80+ from canni 4 versus 150+ from mage pet canni.

I chose the canni 4+quiescene over Son of Rathe (65 earth pet, best
pet canni pet around) and Complete heal because there are more restrictions
on using pet canni than shaman canni.

That gave me a pet, mana regen and a heal in 4 slots - since I play
a mage, the rest of my spells were geared around longterm DPS output
in groups (the full line of nukes) and a slow (for solo ability and
group utility).

My lineup was very raid unfriendly though.
