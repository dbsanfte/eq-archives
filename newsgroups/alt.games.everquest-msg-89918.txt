Absolutely the Druid.  I played a Necro for 2 years and got bored and
frustrated.  My druid leveled in half the time the Necro did and he
was on a different server.  The Druid can go all over the world in a
matter of minutes, run from zone to zone with faster than sow speed
and level all the way to 60 as fast as a Necro can.

If you want to group and meet friends be a Cleric or Enchanter.
Personally after a Druid I would make a Warrior as my second character
followed by a Shadow Knight.
