YEAH!!!  Finally someone posted the SAME (almost hehe) problem I've been having
since the LAST patch!!!

The only difference is, this happens to me if I LD while zoning.  Example:  My
Druid was zoning into PoI and I LD'd.  No biggie, LD happens all the time
unfortunately due to crappy connection...  :(  I get knocked back to server
screen and after the 1018 nonsense goes away, I get the loading screen then as
I get to server select and select my druid again, BAM back to server select I
go.  

I will then get the 1018 message for another 5 min.  When it clears up we go
through the above again...  Lather, Rinse, Repeat for upwards of 8 hours.

However, I can log on any other toon on the account with no problem.  The last
time this happened I /petitioned a GM to walk my druid out of whichever zone it
was.  GM told me to delete all the files for that zone and rerun the patcher. 
I did and the result was......  see above.  :(  

I do /who all GM, none on.  So, I have no clue how long it will take to get my
druid.  Then, husband says, "Log onto your account on my computer and see if
you can get to Pryl."  I do and I can.  I successfully get her back to PoK, log
off on his machine and relog onto my machine and select Pryl no probs.  Then,
being the foolish person I am, I immediately go to that same zone that has been
causing me grief (and no it is not always the same zone if that makes sense)
and viola' I can zone no problems and play no problems...

Then, at a random time a few days or a week later, we do the whole thing over
again.  Obviously it is something with my computer, but I've patched and
repatched every way I can think of including standing on my head, backwards,
reciting the alphabet in Latin.  LOL  I've given up and just immediately go to
my husband's computer to walk my toon out if it happens.

Soooo...  I would try to repatch if I were you.  If that doesn't solve it, see
if you can choose another toon on your account and log in successfully.  If you
can, then come back here and see if anyone has any helpful info for you or
/petition, or if you have access to another puter with EQ on it, see if you can
get to your toon on that puter...  

Good luck hon...  :(  I know it sucks.
