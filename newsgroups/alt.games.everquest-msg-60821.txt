Ah, well, that helps explain it. Yes, try one of those more solo-able
classes, and also wait until you reach a higher level before making
your final call. Hell, I spent the first several levels just getting
the hang of the interface. At level 7, you've really seen only a tiny
bit of what the game has to offer.

Look for the FAQ which gets posted in this newsgroup from time to time
(search for posters name of Taras Bulbas). It's got a good selection
of other links to try as well.

Well, we can do that if you really want :)
