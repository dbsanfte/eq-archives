ok, first off..... TURN OFF YOUR DAMN HTML!!!!

Now.. .having settled that, as the other poster mentioned, go to
Highpass. You can get in orc or gnoll groups there, and then move into
the Keep later. There are other options, of course, but that's a very
reliable one. If you can put up with the asshole factor, you can go to
Lake of Ill Manners.  If you can find a healing partner, your options
are VERY open. You can go hunt gargoyles in Ocean of Tears, or there are
a number of low range dungeons like Najena that you can go explore for
better experience in playing, xp, and loot. Being a barbie, you can also
stay in Everfrost doing calfs and later Mammoth mammas until you get
totally bored.
