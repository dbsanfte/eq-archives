Are you sure?  They sure look like half of them are undead, vampires, 
spirits, ghouls, ghasts... I just assumed that neither ITU nor Invis 
would get anyone past all the mobs.

Thats educational.  My shaman went in with a cleric and a mage, and we 
ran to the advisor room and then AE nuked about 30 mobs to the ground... 
which was fun since we hadn't brought an enchanter to do the AE stun 
part that makes that so much fun.  Again, didn't guess that invis would 
work, because the zone appears to be mixed live and dead just about 
everywhere.

Yep, for protection against debuffers, thats better because it works 
indoors.  But the effect itself, well, frankly its no SOW.
