In fact, no, I don't care to.  You made the claim, I called bullshit,
and now it's your responsibility to back up your original statement.
If you come up with some reasonable proof, then the burden is on me
to attempt to counter it.  You see, that's how debating works.  Neat,
huh?  :)

This example might drive the point home better.  Imagine the thread
went something like this:

Khosh: I have an invisible pink unicorn.  She talks to me at night.

Teckla: Bullshit.

Darktyger: Gosh, nice argument there, Teckla, you fucking dope!

Khosh: You'd better BACK UP your assertion, Teckla!  Sheesh!

...now, do you see how ridiculous this is?  Do you see why the
burden of proof is on YOU at this particular point in the debate?
