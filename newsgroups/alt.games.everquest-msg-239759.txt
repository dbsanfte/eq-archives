Well, the following stuff has been dropping in the old world during
the anniversary events, and some of it isn't too shabby:

http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=fabled

Judging from the comments in the 'event' channel on my server, a lot
of people have no clue about the gear.  A lot of ' where do you get
that?' kinda questions.  Answered of course, with 'the same place you
get the normal ones'.

I've got a hankering to try camping for a couple of them myself.  The
FFBSS and Yak are both sweet.

However, I do believe it's a short term thing.  Would keeping them in
the game be enough to renew more interest in some of the old world?
Keep the items no-drop also, to make sure someone has at least seen
the dungeon to get the drop.
