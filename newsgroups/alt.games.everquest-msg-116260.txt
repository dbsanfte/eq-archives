Dumber than a blunt weapon that procs a gate to the outpost in Overthere?
You have to be kidding when you say this is a dumb proc.  There are melee
classes that would kill to be able to gate to their bind point with all
their gear who just can't keep a 50+ wizard handy at all times for such a
purpose.  I'd expect a weapon with a Gate to Bind proc to sell for thousands
of plat if such a weapon does indeed exist and is droppable.
