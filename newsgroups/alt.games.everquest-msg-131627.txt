So I leveled up to 26 last night night in Paludal Caverns and as I fought
after leveling I noticed that some of the little bandits weren't giving me
exp any more.  I am color blind which is a true hindrance in the game
because I can't see cons but if someone would like to take a second to
thoroughly explain the cons and where I look for them it may or may not help
me.  But my real question is where should I go to fight next.  Two places
that have been mentioned to me a lot are High Hold Pass and then to High
Hold Keep or Lake of Ill Omen.  I was told that I will level in either place
easily as quickly as I did in Paludal (18-26) in a week of between two jobs
playing and that the loot in both places was great.  My problem is that I
have never been to either place and don't know anything about either one.
When I went to Paludal I was met with hostility when I asked simple
questions out of character such as where can I bind and one person actually
tried to get me to jump to my death when I got turned around in Shadow Haven
looking for Paludal Caverns.  So I will ask here which one do you guys
recommend and how do I get to them where do I bind etc.  I know that once I
get there I can get into a group and learn about the mobs.  I know this is
long and asking for lots of information but if someone would like to take
the time to give me some answers I would appreciate it.  By the way I play
on Druzzil-Ro server
