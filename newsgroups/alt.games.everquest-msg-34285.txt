At 35 goto EW and get in a group at the ulthork tree.
At 40 goto DL and get in a group on the north wall of the castle.

Also, don't think that you're gonna get rich charging people for a level 39
rez. Just do it for free if they ask, and make friends. Making friends will
pay off much more than any chump change you get from charging people.

After lvl 50, your friends and connections will mean everything, and you'll
start getting loads of money/loot without even trying.
