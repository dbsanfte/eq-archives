This game is great....there I was, masterful warrior in full regalia
slashing and
bashing my way to level 28 with Wooly mammoth after Wooly mammoth,
Resting when needed and bandaging when needed, in Everfrost near the
split of the river, when low and behold, two Mammoths decided to
'make my day'.  Needless to say, within a short time I was naked,
cold, and on a corpse run.

There are some gigantic spiders that, pulled correctly give dark blue exp
and don't have the corpse run effect, along with pulling mammoths without
getting two on one.

The age old question is where to hunt for decent exp for either solo, or
better, a place to pick up groups for an hour or so at a time.  Plat,
except for a gem or two, is not really needed.

Thanks,

Mccarron on luclin
