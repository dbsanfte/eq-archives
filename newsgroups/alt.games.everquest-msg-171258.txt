Not correct anymore.  Do your homework on the damage done by
a 65 SK with his HT pumped up by AA's.  It would be easy.
With all applicable AA's you do 7200 unresistable damage
once every 72 minutes. 6 x 7200 = 43,200, more that enough
for a kunark dragon IIRC.

Will it ever happen? Highly doubtful.  To get that particular
combo of AA's the SK needs to be level 65, and have a
minimum of 38 AA's.  The combination itself takes 30 or
so of those AA's.  Realistically most sks leveling to 65 will
not path straight to this HT (unless you're on a pvp server)
and 100 AA's or so is probably more realistic.

Add to that, the relatively low number of actively playing high level
sks on any server, and I don't think "Team HT" will be rearing
it's head any time soon.
