   I think he went a bit overboard, but I can sorta see the point.  At the
very least they knew that this poll would be probably piss alot of people
off going by the vocal, unhappy response they got to the item selling
poll.  I wonder if they had their hands over their ears and were chanting
"la-la-la-la" loudly while so many people told them how much they disliked
even being asked.

   I think it is unlikely that they took this sort of risk without some
sort of plan in place to make it worth their while, in their opinion.
