    Or, the loot just doesn't help a character of that level enough. The
idea of people everywhere being ill-equipped enough that they HAVE to huddle
in full groups to take on anything vaguely challenging at their level is a
bad one, as players have NEVER shown the desire to spread out evenly across
the world. They find an "optimal" place to go, word gets out, and everyone
crowds in. Having a crowd in Lake is OK - it can handle a crowd. But having
a crowd in a place like Sol A, where there's only so many "named" camps
around.... I remember the days of "lists", I do NOT want to go back.

    Nope. It will be the "twink" issue all over again, only worse. The
people who camped items will be better equipped than you, and get groups
over you (which apparently happens now with twinks). So you'll feel forced
to camp those items, or items which can get you the desired items in trade.
And that means sitting in one spot, hoping beyond hope for the drop that
will set you free. Ack. And now imagine you level beyond the camp, before
getting your item.....

    Pre-Kunark was very much like this. The big guilds ran Sol B and Lower
Guk, and everyone else crowded into Oggok, Grobb etc. killing stuff for XP.
The people who killed guards were woefully equipped, as they never had the
items to trade for what they wanted and didn't have the items to get INTO
the groups camping items. Plat had almost no value, as it was always
available - ITEMS were the restricted supply.

    I suppose with the old world still being farmable things would never get
that bad. As long as folks COULD farm stuff somewhere, the economy will keep
grinding forward. But a server with all zones on Warrens code.... <shudder>

    Sadly, VI has created a great solution to crowded zones: outdoor zones
with good XP. OT, DL, LoIO - these places never seem crowded because there's
no specific loot camp. Just plop your ass down any old place and kill
whatever is around you.
