I've encountered people who say that, but they get very upset when
anyone mentions that Jesus was jewish. Facts bother them for some
reason. I mentioned to a few of them that no Jew living today could
have done it, they weren't alive back then. I then got a speech
yelled at me about some conspiracy or other and I just got away from
them and decided the peoplewho say such things are not very bright,
or they just like to hate.

I grew up a Christian, but I never bought into the hate mongering
crap.
