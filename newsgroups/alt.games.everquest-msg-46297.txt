Ok, so non USA residents can't benefit from this? What's your point?
Certainly many non USA residents are interested in not only the events, what
we are thinking, but also what is to come? I mean give me a break here, this
is simply a stupid remark!

We should financially cut off money, Diplomatically cut off help, Militarily
cut off real estate, and psychologically change the thinking. Anything less
is ignorant.

The shoe fits, we were fast to point to extremists with Oklahoma and
honestly changed to the proper criminal (that criminal has been tried,
prosecuted, and executed). This case is extremist. The evidence has been
viewed by many UN member states as of now. It's Bin Laden.

Fair enough but if you type something, it's your views, simple making a
disclaimer later is trying to speak your views and then pretending you
aren't going to be responsible for them.

It should be in any forum world wide, we are all subject to these attacks
and should be informed. Quite a bit more important than "How do I slay the
evil chimpanzee guarding the sword of justice".

I am glad honestly. Escapism will prove to be a required avenue in your life
from now on.
