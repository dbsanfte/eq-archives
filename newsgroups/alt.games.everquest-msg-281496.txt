My warrior generates more hate / second than a ranger with equivalent gear
doing anything, except snaring or using flame lick.

A warrior should get on the hate list before using their innate hate
disciplines to avoid the raw hate cap on first aggro.

If the ranger shoots the mob with one arrow, and the warrior shoots the mob
with two arrows, the warrior has more hate.

If the ranger shoots the mob with one arrow, the warrior uses one arrow,
and the ranger stands behind the warrior, the warrior will get aggro purely
through proximity initially, and can then guild a hate lead using discs.

There's a reason or two why Shadowknight's snare incoming mobs ...
