If you are thinking of playing do some research on the race and class of
characters. Each race/class have advantages and disadvantages. There are a
lot of sites out there about the various classes and you can find a lot of
tips on how to play them. You may also want to visit www.allakhazam.com and
www.eqtraders.com for information about the game.
