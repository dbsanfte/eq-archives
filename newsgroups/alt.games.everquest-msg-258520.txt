Well first of all it was *Star Wars Galaxies*, which I mention. Which is 
only 2 years ago. less actually. I don't work for Sony, I just know what 
they told us at that time in beta:
a. Oracle was generating a memory leak in the particular trick they were 
doing, it was directly related to the bazaar system. It would crash the 
database server after about 24 hours uptime, even with only one server 
on it.
b. Oracle told them tough cookies on getting it fixed.
c. They downgraded the version of Oracle they were using, as a work around.
This is from the Holo's mouth.

They didn't give specific versions. Just general numbers. And I might 
have the raw numbers wrong. I do specifically remember a major rollback 
in database version around January of 2003. They had to wipe servers and 
start from scratch, and took the opportunity to decide crafting was good 
enough for beta, and removed the vendors that you could buy weapons and 
armor from.

I don't remember the details. It was the way they were clearing deleted 
items out of the database.. maybe tagging them deleted and not cleaning 
them up. I don't really remember. Also this was just post beta, and they 
had stopped telling us more than we needed to know.

Well then they don't either. I remember many things like customizations 
on items, item stack sizes, inventory sizes, etc... came down to a 
database size issue. I am just reporting what I was told, as someone 
here expressed a vague amount of interest.
