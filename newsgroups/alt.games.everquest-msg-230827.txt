Monual took *forever* to level up to 60.  And not because I wasn't playing
him - I was actually pretty hard-core.  Early on in my EQ existence I was
having more fun exploring.  One of the main reasons I made Monual a human
was because that was the race with the fewest faction problems, and I could
go almost everywhere and interact with almost everyone.

The Karanas were always a pleasant vista, except they are way too large.  I
remember that long, long mountain climb from the Karanas to HighHold Pass,
and heaven help you if you lagged at the wrong time and went off the side of
the cliff.

Firiona Vie was a nice town, and I loved the pretty butterflies.  I used to
aggro spiders on purpose and run them to FV just to see the butterflies lay
some smackdown on them.

Oh, and the ship that takes you to FV is beautiful.  I spent a long time
exploring that ship.  Was fun.  I really enjoyed seeing that ship rendered,
I had no idea it was going to be so elegant.

Slowly I developed a desire to see the high-end game, and eventually settled
down, started leveling up, and eventually joined a full-time raiding guild.
I stopped doing less sight-seeing and more grinding in raids.

I still appreciate the sights, though.  I loved the new LDoN models.  I like
my froglok pally.  =)  Xegony is a beautiful sight to see as you kill her (I
still feel slightly guilty every time I kill both her and Mithaniel Marr).
Rallos Zek throwing his huge ax is an awesome sight (one you don't get to
see much as he's quickly pinned in a corner where the animation is hidden).

So I agree, sometimes we take a lot for granted and don't stop and just
*look* at stuff.  Too often my eyes stay glued to my chat boxes.  But I
still remember the Monual from long ago who heard about a chessboard in
Butcherblock mountains and took a long long boatride just so he could see it
with his own eyes.
