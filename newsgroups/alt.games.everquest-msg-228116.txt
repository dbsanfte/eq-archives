Who the hell cares.  Send the bard and make the SK look slow.  :P

Why would you be the main puller?  Seriously, you just said that the SK
would beat you every time, so why would you force your guild to suffer
through sub-par pulling?

Xuzl...  approach the pull correctly (just use some common sense) and you
get a single every time without ever needing to FD, thus making *my* time to
"split" about 1 second.

Beyond that, did you actually *read* the posts leading up to yours?  :)

And I'm not blind to the fact that I have snare if I want to use it.  You
can too.  Granted, not as handy as having the spell, but those fungus beast
glands are easy to farm and I always carry one in my bag o' tricks.  I
rarely use them, because snare really doesn't help in all that many
situations (the ones it would help the most in are inevitably the ones where
I never land a snare, though the advantage swings to the SK on those because
they can take multiple tries).
