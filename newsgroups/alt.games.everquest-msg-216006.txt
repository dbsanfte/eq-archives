Well it all becomes academic once you start applying the aaxp skills
you get later on. I chose Evocation for my druid, and have since added
a lot of the aaxp skills that make fizzles happen less, give 10% more
to my healing, add more crits, use less mana, etc. So basically you
are making these choices up until you get aaxp for the most part. I
would STRONGLY reccomend getting the POP abilities once you hit 61,
like Spirit of the Wood, and Radiant Cure they really are life savers
later on.

Of course you are talking about a 30 druid, so it depends on whether
you SOLO often or group often? If you solo often then get Evocation if
you group often then get Alteration. The epic is a DOT so I figured
why waste it there. Also work on Divination one of these days it is a
pain but invis does help in places like Droga, and ME when on CR's
etc.
