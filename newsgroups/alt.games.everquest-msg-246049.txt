A heavily twinked pure caster that really has very little reason to ever 
get hit in the first place thinks better healing & health regen is 
unnessary? Surprise surprise :)

Try doing it with a non-twinked ranger... then see how funny it is. 
After a decent fight he first bandages up to 50, *then* meds up, *then* 
casts ghetto heal to 'just about full', *then* meds up *again*.
