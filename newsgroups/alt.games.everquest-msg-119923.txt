Okay, so it's not a "soft cap."   And it's definitely not the "hard cap,"
since
that's 255.  But mana from WIS/INT above 200 doesn't get calculated
the same way as it does below 200, so it's definitely some sort of cap,
correct?  What is it?

(It's still a soft cap, IMO, it's just been changed.)

I keep hearing that, although I hear 6.8 mana/point.   But I'd like
to have your citation, assuming its something other than "well,
that's how the mana calc at castersrealm works.."   Frankly, a
twink level 1 (safe to do now, of course) would only around 40
mana from a base of 200, but supposedly would get 350ish
from adding 55 more?    That doesn't sound right to me.  And
most of my big-ticket items are NO DROP so I can't test it
out...
