Then -definitely- try it and let us know.  A work neighbor here just bought
several used Ultras, and he might be interested in knowing.

I had the misfortune of having to take care of an old PowerPC 7100 with a PC
card in it at one time and it was just plain ugly.  I hope the *nix-based
cards run much better.

Do those cards have their own RAM, NIC and Video, or do they share any of
those with the Sun box?
