Oh, I wasn't questioning its survival.  There's no way SOE could just kill 
it, even if they wanted to--not for a long time, at least.  But I also 
suspect there was no way they were going to come right out and relate the 
entire truth of their plans regarding it before EQ2 hit the ground, either.

I was just sort of musing aloud that I suspect it won't be too very long 
before all but basic life support is withdrawn in favor of the "new kid".
