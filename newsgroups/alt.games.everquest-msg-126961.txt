Also, just to let you know.  With the new exp requirements under 10th level
Crushbone belts and Lego pads work even better than before. My daughter
started a cleric in GFay and gave her 16 belts and 2 pads she collected with
her main in about 30min of farming.  Her first level cleric took the belts
and pads to Kaladim and was instantly 5th level.  She levelled so fast that
her health and mana was at half!
