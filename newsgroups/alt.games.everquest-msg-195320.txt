You do Paffa with 4 people? We never did get to attack him, puller was
bringing the other mobs to the room just outside and we didn't have
the DPS to clear them in time. Finally just got swamped. Am I missing
something really obvious here (necro's charming)?

Thanks, something to keep in mind but probably not worth the hassle of
trying to train past him. From your description, even if it worked
we'd need a mage to CoH the trainer back to us.

Chetari tunnels in DN used to be a favorite loot spot and (pre-pop)
the toughest dungeon crawl I can think of.  Traps that will spawn up
to 10(?) relatively low hitpoint spiders that hit for about 140
combined with Lvl 58+ (unstunable back then) roaming casters that
gate. It's one of those zones I plan to revisit for some payback once
I hit 65, I'm pretty sure I've died more in DN than any other exp zone
I can think of, and there's plenty of exp zones where I've spent a LOT
more time <g>.  It's also the only zone outside of PoP that could
really use a Graveyard imo.

Sounds like my kinda place. Probably more of a 2 group kinda thing at
our lvl though.

<--- points at his skull charm and feels uber! :p 

Thanks for all the info, this is the only fun dungeon zone that I've
seen so far in PoP (only flagged for BoT as far as T3 goes) and I
definitely plan to get to know it.
