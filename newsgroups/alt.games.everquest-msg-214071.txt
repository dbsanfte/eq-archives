Magic based.

Basically adds the lvl 51 spell as a proc.

Fire based, otherwise identical to the original.  For use against magic-
resistant mobs.  I find it has a lower resist rate in general.

Been a while since I've used FoN, but as I recall it does NOT stack with 
Call of Earth as CoE as the higher DS in slot 2.  It does, however, stack 
with Warder's protection where CoE does not.  I'm not sure about 
protection of the wild.  I think FoN is basically the sole member of its 
line.  I'm too lazy to look it up on lucy atm :P

When tanking, CoE is better.  But if you're not then I'd keep FoN up.  
The extra regen on it is nice, and AC and DS don't mean much if you're 
not getting hit :P
