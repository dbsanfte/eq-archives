What I like about the Drolvargs in FV is that there's also a Forest Giant
hut closeby, if you feel like root/dot/medding something to take a break
from the quadding.  They spawn fairly quickly as well.

What I don't like about the same spot are the adds ... frenzied leeches and
frogloks.

Just my 2cp.
