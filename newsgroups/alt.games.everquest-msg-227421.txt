In my experience, NBG ("my greed before your greed") rears its ugly head,
regular as clockwork, with every new expansion.  For a few weeks to a couple
months it's used in pickup groups all across the new zones...  just long
enough for people to start noticing how often and how badly it gets abused.

And then it disappears except for those few (and yes, in my experience with
pickup groups it is the *few*, vocal as they may be) that, to a one, are
either grouped with people they know 98% of the time and feel that the 2%
done in "pickup" groups qualifies them as being knowledgeable about pickup
group trends, or are people that, even if it doesn't rise to the level of
"abuse", realize that they profit from the NBG system.

Perhaps you're the one person that would prove to be an exception to my
opinion of character reinforced by years of "pickup" grouping.  I wouldn't
bet on it though.  Pretty much every "NBG (my greed before your greed)
advocate" falls into one of those two catagories.  :P
