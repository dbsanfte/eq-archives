Some one cast KEI on me for the first time....I'll never be the same.Man is
that spell awesome!I went up a full level in a handful of hours.Then I was
killed ,back to regular mana regan...painfully slow.It's like driving on the
interstate for hours then driving into a town ,you have to slow to 30mph and
suddenly it feels like your crawling.
