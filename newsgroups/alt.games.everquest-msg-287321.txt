I have my 40 Gnome SK parked in DN at the entrance for now. I don't have 
regular access to a tracker unfortunately but a ranger friend is willing to 
check when on for me.

I was thinking I might just go poke around there looking for him with my 75 
cleric and see if I get lucky. He was not up last check days ago so maybe 
I'd be lucky and find him up now. I guess that all depends on demand/farming 
of willsappers on my server presently.

Could a raid geared 75 cleric with plenty of defensives AA solo Vaniki and 
probably some adds would you think? I will try if I find him up and nobody 
else is free to help me with him.

Times like this I wish I had a ranger alt high enough just to go places and 
track named for me... oh, well.
