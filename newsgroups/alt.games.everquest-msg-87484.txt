haha you wanna bet?

Wait till nTov, which is a massive step up from Ragefire, and see what
assholes the uber guilds are like then.

After server downage one time, we quickly assembled in ToV to start clearing
NToV (we havent had shots before/or felt confident in clearing it)  we were
the first guild there without a doubt, so imo it was our damn shot at the
"wing".   Our server has 2 guilds who "rotate" nTov and Tormax.. were not a
part of that rotation, and bear in mind one of the guilds was our "raid
allies" as recently as maybe 4 months ago.

Anyway we got trained like mad, we went on to do something else...  another
time we were killing Doze, while that other guild assembled to do nTov, we
got trained and wiped and they CoH'd over our bodies, killed Doze and went
into nTov

They feel we have no claim to "their" spawn of nTov, and do anything they
can to prevent it.. utter bullshit.

Again recently we tried it, they pulled the same shit.. were forbiddon from
/oocing or /shouting anything to them (which is a good thing, as flame wars
are pointless) so our gm petitions.  The gm who comes does a random, which
we lose (even though we were assembled first) and says they get to do nTov
until they wipeout twice.. after 2 wipeouts they must zone out and let us do
nTov.

Well they wipe out twice to aaenyor(sp?) but do they clear out? nah the lame
bastards just get more guildies in the zone.  As soon as we lost the random
we moved out into a different zone, so we weren't creating lag or trains or
anything like that (which is more than can be said for them).

It turns into a big flame fest on the message boards etc, but its the same
old shit all the time

Welcome to the highend game Jazz, and the fuster-cluck that is known as NToV
