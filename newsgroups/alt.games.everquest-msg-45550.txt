So I decided to take my 13 paladins (a character  I have given up on) equipment
and give it to my brand new human warrior.
I drop a full set of banded armour outside the little shop in Qeynos hills with
17 plat and a few nicknacks and bring my level 1 warrior along to collect the
booty. It all goes well and I take my kitted out newbie back to the gates
outside Qeynos to hunt snakes and such, then I bump into a fellow human warrior
non twink who is a couple of levels above me and he says "How did you get that
gear at such a low level?" I feel guilty seeing this hard working chap so I
give him 7 plat to ease my guilt ;)
Silly feeling guilty really, considering I did earn this gear in a previous
life but there ya go.
It's not such a bad twink is it? ;)
