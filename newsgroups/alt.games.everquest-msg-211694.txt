Well, Son of Rathe (65 mage pet) isn't useless - if you have the right
gear (summoning efficiency 4, only on a cloak from PoS) and AA's (QS3)
it is the single best pet-cannibalization pet in the game.  Add in
Gloves of Dark Summoning from VT and it's amazing.  But as a source of
damage or a tank, the 61 air pet beats it hands down.  Definitely 
shouldn't be a rune spell.
