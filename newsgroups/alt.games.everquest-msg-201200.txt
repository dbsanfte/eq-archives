Certainly much less difficult than it was.
I just started a character on Stromm and checked items in the bazaar.  38
were gnome rogue wearable strength and 21 stamina. Just quick stat check on
a new server. On any other server the item list would be too long to tell I
assume.
Realistically the check is irrelevant. Buffs and items can get your stats
where you want them at a higher level regardless what you start at. The few
extra Hitpoints from sta on an untwinked newb can be the difference in
survival.

But more importantly I really don't think starting stats matter a whole lot.
My 48 half elf druid started life as a gating mule bank storage space for my
rogue potter. Because my rogue was pretty much group only I found the druid
fun when I didn't feel like grouping. Half elfs don't make the best stats to
begin with and putting points into charisma and strength as mule could be
said to have gimped her. But pre KEI root rotting several mobs or double
quadding was fun anyway. Not efficient. Some days not even good for exp. But
fun.
