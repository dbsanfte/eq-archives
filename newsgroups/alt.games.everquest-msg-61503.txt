Ok, even though he was top posting, this really needs an answer, as I'm
becoming concerned. We both use Win 98 at home. It's a very stable
platform compared to win95 IMO, and I've been very content with it. On
the Sony developer's board currently, one of the first questions posted
deals with the upgrade questions, and the poster also claims that Win98
won't work with 512, but differs from the OP here in saying that 256 is
the max before performance deteriorates. Claims he got that from
Microsoft. The Sony representative came back and answered that this was
a myth, and that there was no evidence of that, etc. (as you'd expect.)
  Does anyone have the straight story on this, preferably with a link to
something, either from Microcrap Corp. or a reputable PC magazine
analysis, etc. to confirm or deny. I'm about to blow serious money
upgrading in both hardware and software, and if I've got to wipe my
operating system, I'm going to be:
a) pissed
and
b) even more pissed if I dont' find out ahead of time and have to do it
later and then do everything else over again.
TIA
