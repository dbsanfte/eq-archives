Blah blah blah.

First up, sure, it's not perfect. I'm saying i had fun, and for most
people who play eq1, eq2 will be fun ...IF... it's enjoyed with fun
people, which is 1/2 of what made eq1 fun. The other 1/2, the game
itself, is really solid. That's why i posted, i was surprised. I
really didn't believe it and i hated the idea of playing eq-lite. It's
not eq-lite, it's [eq-pretty and] eq-not-tedious but it's got
substance.

And if you have all those characters with all those levels, did YOU
play it like a soloist? Did you make friends or join a friendly guild
or anything? That makes the experience rich.

For me, eq1 is the lonely game. I logged in Faza and ran around LOIO
and laughed out loud when the erudite professor in the windmill asked
me what i was doing in such far off, deserted lands. LOIO used to be a
wonderland of groups and dangers and fun. I'm sure i don't even know
what the level 20's are doing nowadays, if there are any. Did paludal
caverns ever get replaced, or is it the latest twink factory? Not that
i haven't leveled my twinks there too...

Sony online isn't anyone's favorite. Ancient software bugs really
aren't justifiable, but hardware-wise ... they do their updates
quickly, downtime is sparse, and it's announced or at least
predictable. Don't just whine. Unless it's about MMO's in general,
then i'm with ya ... the genre needs to grow!
