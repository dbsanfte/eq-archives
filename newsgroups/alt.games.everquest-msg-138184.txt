A safe and simple way to reach LOIO is throught The Overthere. Go to the
dock in Oasis of Marr and take the raft into Timorous Deep. On Ogre Isle
(where you land) head towards the rocky out crop to the left of the ogre
village. Go around it until you can see the ogre dock then wait for the
ship to arrive. I think you can swim around to the boat and board it
while it's docked without getting attacked, if not simply wait for the
boat to leave then swim out and board it as it passes. When the boat
passes from Timorous Deep into The Overthere is stops before it reaches
the dock. Jump off and swim to shore, skirt around the outpost and head
south hugging the edge (originally you didn't have to do this, but
recently Verant changed it so that the sabretooths and rhinos that
'scowl at you ready to attack' actually do) until you reach the entrance
to the Frontier Mountains, usually referred to as the ledge. In the
Frontier Mountains keep to the left and hug the edge of the zone where
you'll reach the entrance to LOIO which comes out right next to the
sarnak fortress. HTH. 

Cheers Watchman :)
