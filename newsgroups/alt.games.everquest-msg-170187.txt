OK going to be a little bit before I get to the 59 AA's but does MGB affect
mind wrack?

Would be awsome in a raid have all your casters close by you.

Cast Mind wrack..  Cost 540 mana with MPIII
Everyone around you gets 300 Mana.

Normaly this is a 600 mana for up to 1800 mana spell, but if the aa works It
could become a 600 for up to 18000 mana ( 60 casters and 12 melee) sounds
about write to me if this works  =)

If not I cant see many uses for MGB for a necro.  most of our buffs that are
group are under powered compared to other caster's.

Just wondering..  I am getting close and I want to be ther best I can be.
