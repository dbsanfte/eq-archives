Seems to me like they coded the 3 effects in 2 different ways.  Rage is 7ac
that is a spell effect effective when worn.  The 40atk and 40haste is also a
worn effect, but is not coded as a spell so is listed seperately.  Ignore
the duration time on the rage.  There are lots of spell effects that have
durations listed that are not applicable since they are worn.  If I remember
right, my enduring breath item says it has a duration of 40 minutes, but it
really never wears off.  I agree though that 7ac is kind of weak.
