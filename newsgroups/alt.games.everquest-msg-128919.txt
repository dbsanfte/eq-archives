Warlord MA. (borrowed) 57/58 SA (Not sure if he dinged last night. He
was close). Both WAY better outfitted than mine. We have another 55 in
the lineup if it goes *that* far south.

Yeah. That's my first impulse. But I also don't want to do "something
fun" at the expense of cutting out some of our total DPM and contribute
absolutely zip to the effort for the sake of trying this out if I'm just
destined to be totally resisted, feared off, killed in seconds by AoE,
etc.

If it came down to a REALLY close fight, and particularly if we lost, I
imagine I'd feel like a right pile of shit then.
