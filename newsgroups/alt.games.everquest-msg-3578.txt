 Not counting the 5 levels I have over you that still equals 130AC more
than you have. If you consider that to be on the low side well then...
Guess I can't afford the uberwear. What self-buffed ac would you
consider acceptable? And it doesn't matter how long you've been wearing
stuff. I've been wearing Azure Sleeves since level 6. There's only so
much monk wear out there.

 Maybe.. .What planes equipment? What Kunark stuff? Other than a Sode or
a Rakusha from Hate there isn't much planes wear for monks out there
except maybe for PoG stuff which I haven't really kept up on. 

 You believe you can get 1100 unbuffed.. Well that's a pretty big jump
from your present 950AC I'd say. Good luck with that.

 Anyway the whole point of my initial response is that AC doesn't make a
tank. You seem to be indicating that because you can get your AC as high
(or higher) than warriors you can tank as well as they can. There's more
to it that just raw AC numbers.
