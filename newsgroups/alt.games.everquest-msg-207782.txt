Makes no difference at all. Just do whichever one(s) you manage to
catch the scout for spawned. That's the hardest part.

You don't really need a few more levels if you have a good group
helping. Heck, I did this fight with my (at the time) 52 BST and only
two other characters helping me: A 65 warrior and a 63 cleric. Only
trouble we had with Perma was respawns after clearing the way. With
only a couple more people, that wouldn't have been an issue... In
fact, this trio did all but the Grimling war and the Swamp of No Hope
fights by ourselves. The SoNH fight, we had a large group only because
it was the first spirit I did and we had grossly OVER-estimated the
battle.
