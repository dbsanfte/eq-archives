Your almost done with the plant actually.The instant popping stonemites are
not aggro , you can walk right past them into the big stonemite room.

You must fight the big 12 stonemites in the damn water. This sucks , people
will yell bitch and moan like you would not believe. You have to fight them
in the water. They are not that hard even though they do rampage so you cant
do this all caster (if you where trying) . I suggest the left hand corner as
being the easiest to pull to. They do not come multiple (do not assist each
other )so are relatively easy to pull.

Once you kill the 12 you must kill a semi nasty mob that spawns as soon as
the last one dies. Kill it and you are done.

The biggest problem is you must kill them in the WATER ! Your group members
will yell, bitch , moan and complain that the steps are fine to pull to but
the steps are a deathtrap. If you fight on the steps then eventually a noc
wanderer will spawn right at the steps. It will aggro and then chain aggro
the non aggro stonemites , you will then die a horrible death . You must
fight in the WATER !

p.s. if it appears im slightly irritated about where to fight you would be
correct. I had to do this 3 times to get it right because of whiney bitches
who REALLY did not want to fight in the water.
