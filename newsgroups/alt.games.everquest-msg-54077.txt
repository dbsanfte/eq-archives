Just wish it worked every time.
Was trying to farm velium in CC, and had to run, so i zone out to EW.
When i get out im UNDER the damn fort, in some water with a rygorr cent beating
on me. Couldnt get out, couldnt fight the orc since he was on top of the fort.
Was damn lucky i managed to get a gate off.
