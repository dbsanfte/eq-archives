Ok please help me

For a while now EQ has been dissconnecting between the server and character
select screen. You get the picture of the elf lady then instead of the char
sel screen popping out i have a black screen with "you have been
dissconnected" on it.
My bt internet 56k evening and weekend connection remains intact, but the
game just keeps disconnecting.
This started about 3-2 months ago, but not very often, since then its got
progressivly worse, and now i cant even get on atall.
I have emailed Bt but they havent bothered to respond to me.
If anyone has any ideas Please Please post a reply.

Many thanks
