Sorry, but you kind of exhausted the point of having high dex by 35
for the most part. It doesn't really influence proc to a high enough
degree to not make other equipment choices worth more. Around 40 or 50
its time to think of AC/HP gear as king and kind of ignore stats. Most
rangers will have plenty high dex without trying. You certainly don't
need more than 177 in any event.


>Ear: Cougar Claw Earring x2

Yeah, gotta love those, that is a good item for what
you are doing because its good OUTSIDE of the dex on it.


>Neck: 7dex/7agi Black pearl choker

Get something with AC whether it has dex or not, those stats
don't really help. Rygorr neck is excellent for a ranger and cheap (9
ac, etc)


>Face: Grotesque mask (7dex -9cha 3ac?)

Very suitible item with nice dex. 


>Fingers: 6agi/6dex rings

Again, AC/HP. I'd get the two velium fire opal
rings that are 6 ac 65 hp, usually 950 plat for a pair
(definate bargain) and player jeweler made.  The stats just don't do
much. 

This was even stated back when Brad McQuaid explained what stats do,
generally he said that stats don't do much to make twinking not give
you that much of a boost. It was only since that time they came up
with recommended level and such to curb twinking, so if they made the
game today stats would probably do A LOT but they'd fix it with
recommended level on good stat items.


>Wrist: Ice forged shackels and bracer of scavenging

Don't know about the shackel, but at 9 ac bracer of 
scavenging is a great wrist anyway and has dex on it.
Its pretty much exchangeable with a rygorr wrist as far as 
how much it actually helps your ranger (mainly due to it having
9 ac)


>Arms: Seb Scale
>Shoulder: Tattered Mantle

Great shoulders


>Chest: Iksar regen

Nice, later I'd get the 30 ac 50 hp 10 str barbed ringmail, usually
sold for 5 k plat or less on my server (great for the planes-like AC
and 50 hp). I'd keep the iksar regen bp to 
slap on to generate some HP only when that is needed (like after a
fight while soloing)


>Back: Some ac5 dex5 cloak

As good as anything else really until you get into more uber stuff.
OH my cleric picked up a generals cloak (from some guy in katta) for
900 plat. It is ac 9 or something and 40 hp. That is a darn nice cloak
for the money, especially as a melee.

I'd go for higher AC legs, there are lots around cheap. As a semi
tank, 5 ac at level 35 is junk when nothing else on it really helps
your character much. You had fun with the high dex thing but its
really time to move on now. Even a good damage proc becomes your last
concern since it can't be depended on and you've outgrown
concentrating on an entire kit just for that. When  group gets you as
their tank and you fold like paper and die but proc a lot, they are
not going to care. If  anything proccing a lot with low ac and hp are
going to get you in trouble.

Rangers get great stats on about any race so you can kind of forget
agil AND dex, they are high enough. Get generally the best AC/HP gear
you can for the money and anything else is secondary.
