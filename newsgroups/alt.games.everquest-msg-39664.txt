Like I said, DF is better and I think your table proves it. Sure the total
of numbers on Rygorr adds up to more but the 35 mana and extra 25 health are
pretty negligable, especially as the 22 stamina of a full suit of DF would
give about 65 health after 30th. Darkforge has better spread of resists,
more Magic resist plus does offer fire protection (harder to come by than
cold saves)
Stamina is more important than Strength and the BP of Rygorr (it's best str
giving item) is 2 less than DF. You also missed DF arms give 4 Str.
Personally I'd mix and match where I could but the major items would
definitely be (and are, on my SK) Dark Forge.
