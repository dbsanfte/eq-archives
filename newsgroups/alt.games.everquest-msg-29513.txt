That's the most effective treatment - makes them too risky to attempt, so
they get less publicised. If a guild posted instructions on their website,
they'd pretty much shut the guild down too. Never worth the risk.

The flipside is, if you blab to Verant about verifiably demonstrable
exploits, they give you a prize (I think a month's a free play and a title
for your main, no less)!
