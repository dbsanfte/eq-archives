I've been listening to my Creedence Clearwater Revival album lately.  During
"Run Through the Jungle," I had a flashback to my first days in the game
with my second character, a Qeynosian Cleric, and his early life adventuring
between Qeynos and Halas......
------------------------------------------------------------
"Run Through The Burrow"

Whoa, traveling while encumbered,
Qeynos from E'erfrost,
They told me, "Don't go walkin' slow
'Cause Tranixx's on the loose."

Better run through the Burrow,
Better run through the Burrow,
Better run through the Burrow,
Whoa, Don't look back to see.

Thought I heard a rumblin'
Shoutin'  "Zone with Train,"
Two hundred million Gnolls exploded
Outta their holes they came!

Better run through the Burrow,
Better run through the Burrow,
Better run through the Burrow,
Too OOM to Gate, you see!

Over on the Zoneline
Healing magic's a joke,
For all my mana and my wisdom,
I've gone up in smoke!

Better run through the Burrow,
Better run through the Burrow,
Better run through the Burrow,
Whoa, Don't look back to see!
