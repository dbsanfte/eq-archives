I do not see it as something that really matters.
Raid Records, Raid Points, Dragon Kill Points..

If you attend a raid, and participate in the adventure, you have just given
time, effort and for what?  Nothing???  Oh.. and Item drops.. you could
benefit by it.. but no... you cant, because you are on Raid HOLD..   So..
someone else.. that cannot benefit from it.. gets it.. then goes to the
bazaar and sells it.

/bonk

I say.. if one participates, one gets an equal share....

My guild is getting large.. Uber Guilds, they go to that form of management,
they can keep it..

I think it sux, personally.  I work.. I work hard for my company.. and EQ
comes last in my life, after family and job.. To be penalized because I have
to work, and can only get on at certain times.. way the hell would I want to
get on and play??  If I get nothing in return for my time and effort??  I do
enjoy just being able to play with my friends and family in my Guild.. so
Loot doesn't really bother me.. and I do not seek it.  But to penalize
someone because they have to work and cannot attend your raids, that if he
happens to get on, and just wants to hunt and therefore, since he is on
"Raid Freeze" is not allowed to loot.. that is just plain stupid in the
extreme....

I dont understand you Power Gamers..  It makes little to no sense  at all..
