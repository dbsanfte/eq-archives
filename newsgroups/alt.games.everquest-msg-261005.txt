I think they did the right thing this time. They obviously didn't have
the data to properly balance these solo tasks. (They are focused on
group or raid content, not solo content.) So they made them too hard.
Better that they make them too hard and then work towards easier, than
to start out too easy then work towards harder. People get far angrier
when you take things away from them than when you give them things.
Making it harder if it was too easy would be taking something away
from people.

Obviously the best thing would be for it to be perfectly balanced
right out of the gate, but since we can't really expect that from SoE,
harder than it should be, eventually to be tuned down, is the next
best thing.
