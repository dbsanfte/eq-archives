Not at all, although it is worth noting that Morel Thule prices tend
to be about half what prices on many other servers are.

Think about it, though, with the popularity of the coldain shawls quest,
there are now a plethora of potters.  People have hunted Sand Giants
since time immemorial.  Making the diety is a fairly trivial operation.
There are numerous range items which are better.  Why -should- anyone
pay 200pp?

Yes, a year ago I'd eagerly have paid 1000pp for a 2 wis range slot item.
Then they fixed the diety so it actually worked... and since this wasn't
all that hard to do, prices normallized down towards 200.  Then Velious
comes along and introduces a host of +wis and +mana range slot items...
Not only do the values of items tend to drop as a server matures, but
the gradual addition of better items to the game by Verant degrades the
value of existing items.  When you add the fact that instead of maybe
six or eight potters on a server you now have a couple hundred, well
high supply drives demand down, so prices drop.  Simple.
