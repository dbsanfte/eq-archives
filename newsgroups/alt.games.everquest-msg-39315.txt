I thought I read somewhere that you really can't do much on a horse but
travel.  This was probably an unofficial posting, though.  But - assuming
this is true, it sounds to me like a "horse" is just another model for the
player that makes you go faster.  IE. a costly ( plat ) illusion that
increases movement rate, lasts through zoning ( except where prohibited ),
and looks nice.

So, you are paying a high price to run quickly and look "cool".  Unless they
blow away SoW potions in speed, I don't see the use for them.  The people
with money to blow will go for it as it will be kind of a prestige thing.
It'll look nice at guild meetings and for screenshots, no doubt.

Does anyone have a link handy with Verant's official word on what these
"horses" will and won't be able to do?
