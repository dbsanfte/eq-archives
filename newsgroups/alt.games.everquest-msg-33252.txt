mine is running the generic windows drivers, and the scroll wheel works
fine.

when I installed the logitech drivers for mine, it caused me to no longer be
able to use the mouse to move and look around at the same time. quite
annoying. so I uninstalled them, and everything works fine now.

except that I don't have the use of the scroll wheel as a third button...but
I can live with that.
