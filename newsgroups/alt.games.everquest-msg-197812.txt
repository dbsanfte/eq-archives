    The other day, a guild warrior and myself went to Velk's. The warrior
wanted to let off some steam after a tough day, and figured that duoing
Velketor would do it. Well, he wasn't up, but the rest of the castle was
uncamped. I joined him after he'd soloed a few kobolds in Upper Dogs. Heck,
I was able to solo the kobolds there, even when they were shaman hasted. We
moved into the castle to look around, and at one point my friend pulled a
ton onto himself. Three blue Sentinels (yes, blue to 65), and a light blue
Gargoyle. He tanked them all, kept aggro on them all, didn't use his
Truncheon to slow them, we didn't root park any of them, he didn't /disc,
and he maybe took four very conservative CH's total (I only allowed him to
go berserk once towards the end).

    Yeah, the ZEM for PoP zones should be brought in line with the ZEM for a
place like Velk's. Because the risk is similar, the reward is similar,
right? Right? Just because two unslowed blues in a PoP zone would have been
a very, very challenging fight, which would have required some root parking,
Truncheon slowing, and likely a /disc, that means nothing, right?
