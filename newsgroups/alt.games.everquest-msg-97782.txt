    Look at how Kriggan initiated contact. He had the player death touched
out of a tournament, then told him he was (not could be, was) being
suspended for hacking EQ. Contrast that with the following approach:
allowing the tourney to conclude. THEN, before awarding the prize, tell the
player that he has been observed travelling at speeds above what is
possible, which is a suspendable offense - can you explain this? The player
(hopefully) wouldn't have been as defensive since he hadn't been knocked out
of the tourney before having a chance to explain himself, and because he was
being given a chance to say "um, I'm on my horse". The player was rude
afterwards, but the GM's initial contact was handled poorly.
