Actually, you also are wrong.  The US is hated, first and foremost,
because of xenophobia.  It's the same reason our rednecks hate
foreigners.  We can try to educate our own people, and we do, with
mixed results.  But there isn't a damned thing we can do about the
willful ignorance and jealousy of others so long as they refuse to
allow it.  And when these demon worshipping motherfuckers gun down
aid workers in hopes of being condemned to an eternity of sucking
on satan's barbed cock, they're refusing to allow us to be anything
other than aliens.  After a while it's really fucking hard to put
up with any more of this shit, and the pathetic screeching of
willfully ignorant self-proclaimed leftists from the continent is
not likely to encourage us to do so.

We, the people of the United States of America, have understood
this problem and worked at fixing it for quite some time now.  Some
among us have also deliberately undermined attempts to make things
better in furtherance of private (mostly financial) agendas, and
that is most definitely a bad thing.  But when self-righteous
outsiders make that sort of holier-than-thou pronouncement, without
the faintest hint of an acknowledgement of all that we have done and
are doing and are on record as intending to do along exactly those
lines, well I hope you'll excuse me if I find little of value in it.

All this reflexive anti-Americanism coming from Europe is just as

fucking stupid as the "proud to be an american" morons (what the
fuck do they think they're proud of?  having been born?  where is
the merit in your fucking place of birth?  are they even vaguely
of how ironic their disparagement of immigrants, people required
to earn their citizenship, is?  do they understand the concept of
irony?  why the hell do I have to share the planet, let alone my
homeland, with them anyway?) who are so perversely encouraged by
that self-righteous euro-left ranting.  As far as I can tell,
Sturgeon's Law ("98% of everything is shit") applies without
reservation or qualification to humanity.  It's fucking depressing.
