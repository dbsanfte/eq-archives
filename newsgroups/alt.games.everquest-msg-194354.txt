Hands-down, leather padding.  As people try to do smithing and don't want to
take the time to farm pelts and what-not to make padding themselves, they'll
buy these from you by the stack.  Sell 'em for 20-30pp, whatever the market
is like on your server.  It doesn't make you huge chunks of change, but it's
a steady income.

You might also try making Celestial Essences.  You can buy Essences of Marr
and Celestial Solvents in the Plane of Knowledge for less than 3pp, then
turn around and sell 'em for 5pp in the bazaar.  Again, not exactly a way to
make money hand over first, but a good way to make a profit.  I myself
always buy Celestial Essences for my smithing from the Bazaar - sure, I
could make it myself, but I'd rather save the time and effort and just buy
it from someone who *has* taken the time and effort.

If you're after the really-make-lots-of-money market, you'll need to get a
tradeskill or two into GM territory.  Myself, I'm a GM smith, and have made
oodles of plat selling cultural armor.  Tailoring also can make ya good
money, or baking with that bling bling stat food.
