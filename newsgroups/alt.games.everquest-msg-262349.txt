Are you still getting positive faction hits when you do the turn-ins?
Someone said you might be perma-KOS which I would take to mean you
might have gone to max KOS (i.e. faction can't get any worse). If not,
then the following probably won't work. I presume that you have
avoided actions that would worsen you militia faction.

If you take a chance and do the orc belt quest in Freeport and turn it
in to the head of the Warrior's guild, which builds good guy faction
and hurts bad guy faction (militia) you may be able to see if your
militia faction is max kos or whether you actually take a hit. I
speculate that if you are perma-KOS (i.e. max bad faction) then since
you have done faction work to raise it, it should go down. If it
doesn't (e.g. your faction cannot get any worse), then you are totally
stuck.

If your faction can still go up (though if you are flagged as kos
because of what happened), then you need to do 1,500 to 2,000 cycles
to get out of KOS. Might also note the nature of the /con messages as
you can be Scowling and move to Threatening. That will at least give
you an indication of how deep you are in.
