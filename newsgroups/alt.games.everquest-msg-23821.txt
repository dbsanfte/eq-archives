For a given cash budget to buy weapons, a smart warrior, paladin or
shadowknight will always outdamage a rogue or ranger before level 50 or
so (excepting levels where the rogue has double attack and the other
classes don't). 

The reason for this is 2h weapons, and wurmslayer. 2H weapons (or
anything with a slow delay) are rarely used by high levels. You can buy
a 2H weapon that drops off a level 55+ mob for a few thousand. The
equivalent 1 hander would sell for 10K or more.

The only way to do decent damage as an untwinked rogue is to neglect
armour and save up for a decent piercer, such as a trak tooth (10/20,
about 8k on my server). And that same 8k, plus 2k or so for an offhand,
would buy just about any droppable 2h weapon in the game.
