D&D lives as EQ...
no need for books, paper, dice and you can play whenever you want. I do miss
the personalities that made the table colorful. In today's age who has the
time to do the old-school RP?
Gen-Con last year was mainly a show-off spot for all of the computer games.
I fear we will never see the Cons the way they used to be.
GalathraCon, Gamefest, Contact, ConCave, RiverCon, Man I miss those Cons.

Wait, a sec. I get to go to the gaming portion of those Cons every time I
log into the game. All is not lost.
