Is there anyone on Thouxe-Paells that have horses?  E-mail me and tell
me how they work out.  I think Verant made a big mistake charging
UBER-high prices for horses, seeing how as only maybe ten people on
each server will be buying a brindle.  I would lower it to around 10K
if I was them, 40K for a very good one.
