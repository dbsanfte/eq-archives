>> Where does Kinslayer come up in the Wheel of Time?  The only reference I
can think of for it is the elf-vs-elf war in TSR's Dragonlance history. <<

I don't have the first book anymore, and been awhile since I read it, so
some of this may not be 100% accurate, I'm sure those who are more up to
date will correct me.

Artur Hawkwing, the man who was first called The Dragon and defeated
Ba'alzamon, was also the first one affected by the tainting of the male half
of the True Source. He went insane, destroying every single family member he
could find.

This earned him the name "Kinslayer".

This can be found in the prologue of 'The Eye of the World'.
