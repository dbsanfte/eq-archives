Did he post on the xev server boards?  I'm still trying to figure out if
he is familiar from here, there, or if *gasp* I actually bumped into him
in game.  

I'm feeling waaay too much nostalgia for the pre-luclin days lately.  
Back when I bought a fungi for 18k and couldn't get an offer of more than
5k for my pre-nerf circlet of shadow (/bangs head on wall for not holding
onto that).

I can't believe I'm an old timer. 2.5 yearsa nd I still feel one of the
new kids on the server.
