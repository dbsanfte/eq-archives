I have to agree, that 50-60 xp grind is just something that puts players
off. I know that burned me out several times during my 50-60 career, and
nearly caused me to quit several times. I guess SOE saw this as a problem
that a majority found this xp grinding really really boring.  You get
inspired when you feel your character advance, but for many the old 50+ xp
grind doesn't feel like any reward at all.
I think the XP in PoP is how it should be for high level characters, and did
inspire many people that might have quit to keep on playing the game (and
still does).
