Personally.. the game needs to undergo a paradigm shift in the way
non-instanced zones are handled.

AoW ring = Agro on Statue, ring is locked to raid, noone else can
damage. Upon completion of the event, Statue respawns.

The fact is, events should permanantly be up unless being done, and
respawn instantly when not. Time to be able to rerun the event is
tracked to the user account and equal to the old spawn timer. This is
something fairly easy to implement, as the events stay exactly the
same in execution... only a check for if it is runnable by the raid
agro'ing is added.
