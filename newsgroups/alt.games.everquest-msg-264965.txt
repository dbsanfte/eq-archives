Yeah, but even in games with The Vision, I'd like to see them at least tell
us the factors, if they won't give us the formulas.  For instance, in DAoC,
I don't think they've told us what the parry formula is, but they have told
us that each point of parry skill adds 0.5% to your parry chance, so I can
look at a +4 parry item and make some reasonable assessment when comparing
it to some other item for the slot.  I'd love the exact formula, but at
least giving that one component of it gives me something reasonable to work
with.
