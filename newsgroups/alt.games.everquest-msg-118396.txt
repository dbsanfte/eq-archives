The Paludal Caverns on Luclin are nice. The part towards Shadowhaven
are a bit high for you at 12 i think, as a solo. If you are in a group
no problem.

But with invis, you should be able to go to the part of the cavern
next to Shadeweavers Thicket. Theres a small lake there surrounded by
Sensate Reishi Mushrooms and Muck Diggers. The Reishi are not social
and will not support each other, whereas the diggers will.

When you gain a few levels the Plargs are good too.

The XP is good in the Paludal, and you should get to lvl 20 easy. For
bonechips visit the Shadeweavers from time to time.

Good hunting.
