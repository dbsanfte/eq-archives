Monks get this problem when they reach a level where they have enough
special attacks (all of whom are from the combat bank) and want to keep up
skills for disciplines that are based on lower level special attacks
(Thunderkick is based on Flying kick, Silentfist is based on
Dragonpunch/Tailrake and Ashenhand based on Eaglestrike).
