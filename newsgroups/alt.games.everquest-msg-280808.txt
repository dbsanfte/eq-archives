Indeed, and playing together doesn't mean 'playing the same game at the
same time', it means for me, working together with each other in the same
place to achieve the same goal.

No, it's really quite annoying if you don't enjoy playing on your own at
the same time as your friends playing on their own trying to move somewhere
to do what it is you actually bought the game to do.

>You have fun getting your characters all to the same place.

No, I won't have fun doing that.  You might.  I wan't *choice*.

So, I play the game on my own, and spend the time telling my friends what I
just did.  Well, I can also do that in a single player adventure, and tell
them what I'm doing and how far I got.  That's not playing *with* my
friends that's playing *at the same time* as my friends.

>Well, I never had any trouble running to docks or surviving boat rides. 

Ah right, so it's totally trivial then?  Wow, and I thought the game got
made easy, it must have been totally trivial for any level 1 player to run
from Kaladim to the docks without getting killed?

>People who died on boat rides usually did something stupid like jumping off.

Or, usually got dropped when the boat moved off before they zoned, or some
display lag left them in the water with the boat too far away, or a number
of other issues, which are game caused, not player caused.

But I don't WANT to level my cleric alone, I WANT to have fun levelling my
cleric with my friend.  Play WITH not AT THE SAME TIME.

Oh, bind points, weren't they added later on in the game?  A later
expansion added those I seem to recall, making it too trivial and easy.

No, I want the grouping experience with my friends to be challenging, but I
don't want it to be a challenge to group with my friends - how does that
not make any sense?

When I play with my friends, I want to be challenged by the game.
When I want to find my friends to group up with I don't want the game to
obstruct it.

>> Oh yeh, a boat load of fun that is.

No, being grouped with friends, pulling mobs in a dynamic environment with
risk is fun.  Dying because you don't quite know how to move through
Faydark because you've never been there before but you got the boat to
Butcherblock to meet a friend who's been playing the game 1 hour as well
isn't fun, it's frustrating.

Having the *choice* is the key here.  Having the *choice* to use the boat
and explore the world, OR, to be able to get to where your friends are to
have fun challenging the content *together*.

So, Crushbone -> Greater Faydark -> Butcherblock -> Boat (however long that
takes to arrive, and then move you around) -> Freeport (several zones) ->
East Commonlands -> West Commonlands -> Kithicor -> Highpass -> HK in 10
minutes?  Sure.

Or do you mean you stand in GFay and hope to beg a passing druid or wizard
to move you to WC?  So they can earn a living?

I wasn't responding directly to your post, this is usenet, welcome to
thread drift.

I was responding to one element of your post, about travel being a
challenge, in light of the several posts recently about how EQ has been
made too easy and that it was 'much better when it was hard'.
