I would advise Everfrost, but mammoths are a little high at 21 to solo.
Orc mountaineers and shaman, should be dark blue or white, drop up to 5gp
cash, bronze weapons, and other loot worth a few gp each.
Orc troopers might be green but drop a bracer you can turn in for good exp
to Hoyce in Halas (its a bst quest but the exp rocks).
Mammoth calves might still be dark blue and are easy to kite, their tusks
are about 3gp each, and you can turn in 4 of their hides for exp and a item
worth 2-10pp to the merchants.
Gigantic spiders, yellow or red at 21, are easy to single pull and are
rarely camped.
Everfrost can easily last you into your low 30s.
