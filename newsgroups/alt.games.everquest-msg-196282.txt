Do you have the version of EQ with all of the expansions? If so you
can use the Plane of Knowledge books to travel to most of the cities
in the game world. You will need the "planes of power" expansion to
use the books. I also recommend www.eqatlas.com as a fantastic source
for maps and general information about the various zones in the game.

You may not be using the right chat channels. The odds are that other
players are not hearing you.

Hitting enter will "say" and only people near you will hear it. Use
the following slash commands to make yourself heard across the zone or
by a specific person.

/shout
Only use this if you want the whole zone to hear you. Best used as a
warning message to other players if you pull a train of angry creaters
to the zoneline. Please do not spam a zone with "shouts". Shout text
will appear in red by default.

/ooc
Out of character. This can also be seen zone-wide. The channel is
there for you to ask questions about the game. Again do not spam the
zone with "ooc" messages. OOC messages appear in green by default.

/tell <player name>
This will send a private message to the person with the name you type
in. "Tells" appear in purple by default.

/ttell 
"ttell" will secnd a message the player that you currently have
targetted.

See chat channels above.

EQ is huge!. Once you get past the communications barrier you should
be fine. I have run into more great and friendly people playing EQ
than in any other online game I have ever played.
