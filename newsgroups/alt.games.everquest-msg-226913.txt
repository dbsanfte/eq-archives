It doesn't happen in a pickup group, but my regular experience group (back
when I had one) would do this very often.    I loved it.   Mostly we were in
Charsis or Chardok.  After PoP came out, we roamed the hobgoblin caves a few
times, but everything was too overcrowded and over camped to really do it
anywhere planar. (And non-planar locations were all green at that point.)
