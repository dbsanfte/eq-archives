No kidding! I have been playing on the test server for a few days and while
there are a few players that hate it the majority love it. Playing as a
monster and fighting monsters that do more than just stand there. Fighting
casters that use tactics to their spells rather than just trying to cast
drowsy or something on you over and over again. I must say I am having a
blast with it. I have a level 10 druid in Kelethin right now and easy XP in
the newbie areas when the orc centurions or shamans come over and I step out
of hiding. =)

Bwhahahaha!
