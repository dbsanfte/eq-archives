When our guild first started we had a begging event.  You were to go out
and beg from everyone, rollplaying that you were in a poor guild trying
to get start up funds. 

About half the people in the guild decided they couldn't stomach being
humble, and refused to do it.

I was about lv 40 enchanter at the time.  So I went /roleplay, took off
all my gear and ran around begging.  I went up to every person I could
find and said "sir(or lady), might you spare a few coins for our guild
treasury, we are a poor guild for newbies and trying to start up.  Even
a single copper will help."

I got lots of threats and swearing, lots of ignoring, and maybe one out
of 10 people gave me some utterly worthless junk. I got more from newbie
low levels than from the higher lvs as well.  I also ran across a monk I
had regularly grouped with previoulsy, I asked him in this way too, and
he started swearing at me as well.  So if you think Roleplaying with get
you anywhere you are utterly mistaken.  

After getting anything from them I buffed them with every spell
available to me.  At the time kunark had come out not too long ago, and
clarity could still get me 5 pp a pop if I felt like it, so they were
getting far more worth from me than I got.
