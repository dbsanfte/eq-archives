The summon companion spell is, as I recall, 34 or 39 (something like that).
At that level, enchanters pretty much never use the pet unless they are
soloing (and often not even then). The rare time that it DOES get used
(since you can't back it off, it has a horrible tendency to break mez), you
usually will go to the place you want to go first, and THEN bring out the
pet. I don't see summon companion being even remotely useful for enchanters
the way that the other pet classes can make use of it.
