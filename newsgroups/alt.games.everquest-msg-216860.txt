Every class that can slow can also haste, in varying amounts.   We're not
talking about the difference between 0 haste and 60 haste, with a shaman for
instance, we're talking about the difference between 50 percent haste and 60
percent haste.   Or 60 percent haste vs 60 percent plus some ATK, depending
on what level you compare them at.
