|Most online games design them that way.  That is why you see them that way.

	UO didn't, and trade skills were still a side dish.

	Actually I funded almost all my equipment acquisitions up to planar level
with trade skill profits.

	It's still possible to make a good amount of money with trade skills in
EQ, but you'll need 250 skill and drops from some really gnarly places to do
it.

|You can't

|virtually everything for sale is designed for combat.

	There's a reason for that.

|You can only
|participate in a tiny slice of the game because most of the content is
|geared towards mid- to high-level players, and a person who does nothing but
|tradeskills can't level.

	Which will be true in SWG as well.

|You can't really make that much money because
|although GM tradeskillers can make some nice items, all the *really* nice
|items are looted from NPCs.

	The planar trade skills make very nice items -- nicer than a lot of
players will ever see otherwise.

	I was successful as I was because pre-Kunark, the second best bow in the
game was made by PCs, and the best was ultra-super-mega-OMFG-rare.

|You're pretty much relegated to a life of
|sitting in the bazaar, buying components, doing combine after combine,
|failing many of them because your skill's not high enough, and sitting on
|your ass in the bazaar trying to sell shit.

	And you have just described what will be the life of the dedicated
craftsman in any mud, ever.

|You would barely even ever talk
|to anyone.  Yet there is still an amazingly large number of players who
|tradeskill and level their characters mostly so that they can get the stuff
|to do more tradeskilling.  Granted, this is only a small percentage of the
|population

	"Amazingly large" and "small percentage" do not go together.

	It's not that many people.  And they have a short lifespan.  In UO, the
expected lifespan of a player-run vendor selling player-made goods was under
three months.

|but if SWG can make a large portion of the game content with
|tradeskillers in mind, 

	And how do you propose to do that?  There is no THERE there when it comes
to tradeskills.  Clicking the combine button is just not that interesting at
the end of the day.  

|think about how much more of those guys there would
|be.

	I expect there will be no more dedicated craftsman characters in SWG than
there were in UO.

|Now granted, these numbers are not all that extensive, and yes, the combat
|professions are in the majority, but as you can see there is a significant
|number of people who would make trade professions their profession *of
|choice*.

	I put no trust in these surveys.  The sample is pathetically small and
self-selected.

|create their first character.  That doesn't seem to bear out the theory that
|"everyone's gonna want to hack-and-slash".

	The ones who don't won't be around for very long.  At the end of the day,
SWG will be driven by combat, and trade skills will be marginally more
important than they are in UO.
