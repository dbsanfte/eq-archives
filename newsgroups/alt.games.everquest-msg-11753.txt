As one of the resident tailors, I would say, that I tend not to charge,
if the customer provides own materials.  You are a tradesperson, so you
know, that even on trivial stuff, the failure rate is between 1 to 4 and
1 to 8.  So.... If you accept the 10-25% poof rate, you will likely get
free work.  Although,  with the higher end stuff, I am tempted to put a
service charge as well on success.  Another option, would be making an
arrangement to buy/sell at a discounted rate for preferential
treatment.  Obviously you need someone honest for that.

my DEF ENC was hunting in Nek and hears this guy /auc bring me your HQ
bear skins, and I'll attempt to make them into backpacks for free.  Now,
as a tailor, my ears perk, as he's obviously trying to get others to
finance his training,  No problem there, but the scam potential is
enormous.  Ended up in a good chat,  He changed it to /auc paying 15pp
for HQ bear skins, or I'll try a backpack, money back if I fail 5pp. 
Still scam possibility, but... He ended up getting some bites both ways,
and Got to sell a pack for 100 next door in EC
