  Bah, this has made my decision a little more difficult.  I'm building a new
system, and I had settled on buying a GeForce3 Ti200 to put in it...

  But now here comes along the GeForce4.  I'd be willing to spend the extra $40
or so for a GeForce4 Ti4200, but the thing doesn't come out for 2 months!
That's longer than I want to wait to play Luclin.

  There's the GeForce4 MX 440/460... which looks doesn't look like it's quite up
to snuff in DX8 games when pitted against the GeForce3 Ti200.  Since EQ runs on
a DX8 engine, I suppose that means the GeForce3 Ti200 would make a better
choice.  The GeForce4 MX models do a lot better in older games that don't
utilize DX8 features, but the GeForce3 Ti200 performs well in older games
already... though it doesn't have the better antialiasing of the GF4.

  And then there's the RADEON 7500 and the 8500 OEM to consider... but I shy
away from ATI for the usual reasons.

  I guess I'll stick with my decision to get a GeForce3 Ti200, providing I can
still find the thing when I'm buying.  I wish I had a GeForce2 MX400 right now
instead of my sucky VooDoo3, or I'd just build the rest of the system and use
the old card for a couple months until the GF4 Ti4200 comes out... but I'm not
going to build a brand new system with an Athlon XP 1700+ and 512 mb+ of DDR
SDRAM (or aroundabouts) and then stick an old graphics card in it that doesn't
even have T&L, and I'm not going to spend $50 today for a new graphics card only
to replace it 2 months from now with a new card.  Ah well.
