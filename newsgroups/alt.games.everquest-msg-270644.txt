<sites snipped>

What, exactly, is the difference between having a NPC in-game tell you
exactly where to go and what to do to complete a quest (or an an exact
tradeskill recipe)  and having to go to a third-party site to get the same
info?

Personally, I like the fact that I've never ... not ever .. not once had to
go to an outside resource to comple a quest or come up with a recipe in WoW.
IMO, getting the info from a NPC tends to keep one more engaged in the game.
