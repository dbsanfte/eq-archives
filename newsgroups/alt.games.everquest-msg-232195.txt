I see in my website logs that I had three visitors last month who got there
via searches for "weird everquest sexual stuff" in search engines.  There is
something...disturbing...about this.

(No, I don't have any weird everquest sexual stuff!  What I have is a page
full of weird, strange, interesting, funny links, and some are EQ related,
some are sexual, and so that page shows up, even though the EQ stuff and
the sexual stuff have nothing to do with each other)

(Top search hitting me this month so far is "spoon menace".  I have a link
to the "spoon menace" site, so that makes sense, but my page is on something
like page 4 of the Google results, so I'm surprised anyone would get to it.
I'm #2 for "weird everquest sexual stuff").
