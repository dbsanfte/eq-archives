All the things I have listed... I do...

You don't like sporting events...

Try Disney world...

I spent 10,000 in a 10 days the last time we took the whole family to
Disney..
It was great,,, we stayed on property, food was wonderful, it was a great
family event!!

How about a trip to NASA... that is FREE but I paid for gas, food,
lodging...

I think you may have misunderstood... EQ is not all I do, I have a very
active family, and a very active life.
Bowling,  gardening, Disney, my childrens and grandchildrens sporting
events.  My wife and I travel.  My career keeps me very busy.

I am not complaining.. I have gladly paid all of the money for all the
things I have done... I love my family and will do anything for them...
hell.. its only money... The point I was trying to make...

Everquest is not expensive compared to all the things that myself my family
and most people do.

It is one of the most entertaining things I do... I have a 65 SK, 54 Necro,
56 Druid, 47 Mage, my wife has 65 Druid, 65 Enchanter, 65 Cleric, My
daughter has 65 Cleric, 65 Beastlord, my son in law has a 65 SK... My
grandson has a 26 warrior...
