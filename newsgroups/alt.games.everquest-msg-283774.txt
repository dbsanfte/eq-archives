Is the duration still very short compared to Druid snare?

Here's how it worked back when I was playing, for someone who wanted to
kite, say, 4 mobs.  The Druid would go to each mob and snare it.  Their
snare used very little mana, so they'd probably get it back just through
normal regen while they are leading the snared mobs in a circle to get them
ready for killing.

If for some reason it took a long time for them to get all 4, they could
just snare them each again--it was cheap enough.

Now compare to a Wizard.  Wizard snare was a lot more mana, and only lasted
around 2 minutes.  If a Wizard were to snare each mob individually, then
gather them up, then do one more snare to make sure they all stay snared for
the duration of the nuking, he wouldn't have any mana left for nuking.

Thus, the Wizard approach was often to aggro the mobs without snaring (I
used a Staff of Temperate Flux) for this, and jboots to stay ahead of them.
The gathering them into a circle is done with the mobs unencumbered.  Then
one AE snare to get them snared (and if any resist, they will likely get a
hit in, because as you are snaring, they are closing at full speed).

Whenever Wizard and Druid abilities overlapped, it seemed that the Druids
got the better deal.  Look at where ports went.  Wizards had things like
Cazic Thule, or that one to Skyfire that dropped you off in the middle of a
place where about a dozen 40-50 aggro mobs pathed through, whereas Druids
went to some fairly safe place.
