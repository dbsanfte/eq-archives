Because of the original recipe:
Digby p. 228/177
http://www.kal69.dial.pipex.com/isbn769.htm

Cut pieces of quick, fat, rich, well tasted cheese, (as the best of 
Brye, Cheshire, &c. or sharp thick Cream-Cheese) into a dish of thick 
beaten melted Butter, that hath served for Sparages or the like, or 
pease, or other boiled Sallet, or ragout of meat, or gravy of Mutton: 
and, if you will, Chop some of the Asparages among it, or slices of 
Gambon of Bacon, or fresh-collops, or Onions, or Sibboulets, or 
Anchovis, and set all this to melt upon a Chafing-dish of Coals, and 
stir all well together, to Incorporate them; and when all is of an equal 
consistence, strew some gross White-Pepper on it, and eat it with tosts 
or crusts of White-bread. You may scorch it at the top with a hot 
Fire-Shovel.

Main problem is in the changes in methods of cheesemaking, modern 
cheeses are currently made with partially skimmed milks [they outsource 
their milk from comercial suppliers who defat all milk to fall into 0%, 
1%, 2% and 3.5%/whole milks. Guernseys and other cows can top 7% 
butterfat content. Creamcheese [or even drained quark] can correct the 
fat content without fardling up the protein content that just doubling 
the amount of butter would do. <sorry, my main other hobby is Roman, 
Medieval and Renaissance cooking...>

But trust me, if you like brie, this stuff can be heaven on earth=)
