A cleric partner of mine was testing out some spell he had just got that makes 
the enemy forget who it was fighting. This is all fine and dandy, gives you a 
good way out if you could cast it on something you don't want to fight. The 
problem I see with it is that the enemy forgets where all previous damage came 
from. Now this cleric could just whack an enemy down to 1%, use the spell, then 
let a newbie friend (not too newbie as to not hit at all, however) kill the 
enemy for all of the exp. Power leveling at least has to be within reason, you 
couldn't sit and buff and heal a newbie if they would die in one or two hits. 
With this the newbie can be in no danger at all, however, because you would 
just fight mobs that flee when low on health. The making the enemy flee part 
seems cool and useful, but the exp part seems to me useless in all regards 
except to help someone else level. Am I missing something?
