Spells don't drop at all in Pop!  However, if you mean parchment drops... well I
sure hope drop rate went UP because the only way for it to go down would be for
me to have to return the single drop I did get in a solid week of work; a
Negative drop rate would be needed!

Oh man, this would have sucked in a huge way, a paladin getting a spectral
parchment and finding it gives Yaulp IV or something?  Wow, as rare as the drop
rate is, and with hybrids lower on the "important that you get your spells"
totem pole, that would have had me raising the roof at Sony, surprised I didn't
see anyone posting about it here.

No rent spells as rewards for handing in parchments seems like a spectacularly
bad idea; as much work as it takes to get one, and as eager as we all are to see
new spells, can you imagine getting a level 62 no rent while still 61?  I know,
kill yourself and leave the spell on your body... what a great role playing
solution that is.

Heh, I had a little trouble with that at first myself.  Still, can't believe
most people haven't figured it out by now.
