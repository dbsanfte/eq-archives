Yeah... I just made a level 1 kitty rogue with a sebilite croaking
dirk, LSoEE, barbed ringmail, Iksar BP....

I feel sorta guilty. But... its HARD to get excited about a 10/22 now. I've
got too used to thinking about stats as a 59 ranger instead of a 1 rogue.

Hell, even my druid has a 10/20 bonking stick with AC and wis....

On the other hand.... Glowing red fist! WOOOOP!
