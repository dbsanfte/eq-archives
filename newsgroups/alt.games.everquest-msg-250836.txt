Yeah but its farkin hard as a bard to do that kind of power soloing
and even good ones die to their kites from time to time.

Necros are easy too but a druid combined very fast leveling with being
virtually invincible solo. The only time a soloing druid dies is if
they totally suck or someone else kills them while they aren't
watching. When we were talking about easy to play, we were referring
to everything involved, not just leveling.
