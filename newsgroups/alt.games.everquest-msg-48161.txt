He's a druid, making fruit and berry juice *much* more convenient.
Combine one store bought water flask with two foraged fruit or two
foraged berries to get five bottles of non alcoholic juice. Berry
juice is trivial at 21, fruit juice at 24. You don't need to buy
bottles to make it, and you can drink it instead of water.

I went through Mead, Short Ale, Ale and then made wines. A very nice
new way to get master skill is to combine one water flask with one
foraged vegetable, you get undrinkable vegetable oil which is trivial
at 102. And like everyone else, I got recipes and a list of brewing
supply vendors from www.eqtraders.com :)
