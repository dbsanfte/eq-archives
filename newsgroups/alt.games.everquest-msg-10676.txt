With good CHA and faction you can get about 19p at a vendor.  Yes, I know, I
didn't answer the question yet.

Black pearls drop often enough that there's no big demand for them anymore.
If I see someone auctioning them I offer as much as 22p for them, and may go
up to 25 if I'm running a little short (not likely) on my supply of them.
