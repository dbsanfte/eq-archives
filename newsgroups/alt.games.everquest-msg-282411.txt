"I'm not your slave" is a comment that has no racial connotations but
expresses the point that bizbee, in his ignorance, was trying to make by
saying "I'm not your nigger".  That phrase, on the other hand, equates
slavery with being black, and with the connotation of the word is undeniably
derogatory.  (I am giving bizbee the benefit of the doubt assumption that he
is not actually racist, I could be wrong.  =P  ).

John Lennon on the other hand was acknowledging and speaking out *against*
unfairness by equating the lack of rights/respect for women with the plight
of the people called "nigger".  Anyone that has seen GI Jane (Demi Moore
gets naked, highly recommended) saw John Lennon's sentiment expressed in the
phrase "You're just the new nigger".

Can you see the difference yet?  If not, no biggie.  Ignorance is nothing
new.  The world manages to keep right on turning.
