Old days?  Shadowhaven?  Man, I've been using tradeskill containers since
before the Lake of Ill Omen even existed, much less Shadowhaven.

Tradeskill containers are the same thing essentially, but they had the added
benefit of concealing your items, and if you ever had problems logging back
in, the stuff would stay there until someone found it or the server went
down.  Stuff doesn't rot when it's it a container.

I used to use the pottery wheel in Qeynos.  Not only was it completely out
of the way such that most people didn't even know it existed, but also the
closest pottery supplies were sold in Western Karana, so it wasn't as if
anyone was going to be using it anyway.
