It's only a communications channel. Ostensibly, people should use it for
in-character chat (like /ooc for out-of-character chat, /auction for selling
& buying, /guildsay for guild chat, etc), but there's no way of enforcing
it. If you don't like to see people shouting (i.e. communicating to the zone
instead of their immediate surroundings), you can switch it off -
Options/Chat Channels.

Alternatively, use /usercolor (I forget which number) to turn shouts into a
nice pastel shade that won't get you quite so angry. Maybe buy a vase of
flowers, drink herbal tea, turn the Slayer CD off too.
