GREAT stuff Ben and others...

Could you go farther and post the actual scripting (commands, pauses,
etc...) for some of the more usefull (not emotes) ones so I can email to my
friend.  She has trouble with the scripting format in EQ and I want to give
her an instruction sheet.

like for forage, I would imagine...

/sit off
/doability #
/sit on

that kind of thing..


thanks
