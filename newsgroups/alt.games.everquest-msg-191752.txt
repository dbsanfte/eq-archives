I'm a level 56 cleric, but am always dirt poor due to dot costs etc.
Most of my groups lately have been planes, where there's very little
chance of getting reimbursed for dots, much less making a bit (though
exp rocks).  I've tried farming plat in RM but have gotten sick of the
ksers there and the overcrowded conditions.  3 out of 4 pickup groups
I've gotten in Sebilis, have ended up with the ML either camping out
without doing split (much less reimbursing me for dot cost) or with ML
going LD.  Only time I've made a profit in Seb has been in guild
groups, but my guild hardly ever goes there nowadays.

Anyway, I'm in search of alternate sources of income -- I'm sick of
Seb because of repeated history of problems there, sick of RM now.
What other places are good for plat nowadays (soloing or otherwise).
Experience is a plus but I may be needing to be able to get a pickup
group there if soloing is not possible.  Every time I see a cleric on
a horse, I am dumfounded.  Maybe I'm just unlucky.
