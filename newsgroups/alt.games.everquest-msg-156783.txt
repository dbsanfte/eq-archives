Making my wish list of items to buy when I can afford them and wondering if
anyone has any suggestions of better items around the same price ranges.
Any purchase I'd like to keep below 2k since this is an amount I can
actually foresee acquiring without waiting for weeks to buy just one item.

This is what I currently have (also in the link in my sig but I know Magelo
isn't working for some people): all stats that don't matter to me are not
mentioned

Ears:  Jasper Gold Earrings - WIS +3
Fingers:  Silver Jasper Rings - WIS +2
Neck:  Black Alloy Medallion - AC 6 WIS +5
Face: Silver Ruby Veil STR +4 WIS +4
Head: Othmir Fur Cap - AC 3 DEX +3 WIS +6 AGI +2 HP +7
Wrist: Runed Mithril Bracer - AC 4 STR +3 WIS +5
Wrist: Bracers of the Reverent - AC 9 WIS +5
Arms: Giant Scalemail Sleeves - AC 11 WIS +3 HP +20
Hands: Gauntlets of the Black AC 15 STR +4 WIS +3
Shoulders: Adamantite Epaulets - AC 9 WIS +7
Chest: Sebilite Scale Coat - AC 22 STR/CHA/WIS +6 SvC/M +2
Back: Kunzar Cloak - AC 7 WIS +2 SvF +10
Waist: Crystalline Belt - AC 5 WIS/AGI +3 HP +10
Legs: Imbued Mithril Reinforced Leggings - AC 8 CHA +3 WIS +2
Feet: Boots of the Reliant - AC 11 SvD +6
Primary: Springwood Club - 9/25 STR/WIS +5
Secondary:  Charred Guardian Shield - AC 10 WIS +9
Range:  Eye of Kvaknak - WIS +2 Mana +20

This gives me with my base stats:
STR 87
STA 70
AGI 90
DEX 73
WIS 207
CHA 89

HP (with all own buffs aside from symbol) - 1205
AC (with all own buffs) 415

------------------------------------------

Anyway, these are things I'm looking to buy eventually in the order I plan
on picking them up: (all prices are what I saw in the bazaar so are
estimates)

Acrylia Studded Cloak - 7 AC STR +3 DEX +5 WIS +10  -- I can pick this up
from a guildie tailor for 500pp

Tribal War Boots - 12 AC STR +5 WIS +3 AGI +5 HP +10  SvF/C +5 SvM +10  ---
1500pp

Dark Ember - 13/32 STR +2 WIS +5 HP/Mana +20 SvF +7 Effect (Burn)  ---
750pp-900pp

Crystal Chitin Shield - 20 AC  WIS +9 Mana +40 --- 1800pp

Teacher's Syllabus (Range) WIS +3 Mana +20 SvP +2  Enhancement Haste II -
750pp

Sun Leggings - 10 AC WIS +4 HP/Mana + 10 -- 900pp

Forest Loops (2) - 2 AC DEX/AGI/WIS +3 --350pp each (or campable off of
Giants)

Velium Ruby Veil - STR/WIS +8 -- 700pp

Velium Jasper Rings (2) - WIS +7 -- 400pp each
(both the Jewelry items I can probably get off of an enchanter friend who
makes lower end items like this at cost)

--------------------------

This would make my stats:

STR- 96 (gain of 9)
STA- 70 (same of course)
AGI- 101 (gain of 11)
DEX-84 (gain of 11)
WIS-234 (gain of 27)
CHA- 86 (loss of 3)

HP - 1245 (gain of 40)
AC - Unsure since I'm not exactly sure how AC is figured

---------------------------

Wow, that took forever to write out....anyway, any suggestions of better
items within my range?  Thank you for any advice.
