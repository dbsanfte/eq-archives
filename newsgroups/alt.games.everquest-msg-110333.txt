Gah, I'd take umbrage - but you're right.

At level 54 I'm just not feeling inadequate.
Of course, I just don't go on raids that have
a no pets rule - I don't enjoy being a mod rod
whore, so I don't do it.  I'll never get my
epic with that attitude, but I play the game
to have FUN, and sitting around for 5 hours
pooping rods in hate for a slim shot at an 
earth staff doesn't qualify in my book.  OTOH,
I had an absolute blast trying to help our
rangers and druids get a jade reaver in CoM.
I definitely felt powerful and needed there.
