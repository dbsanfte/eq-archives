I've never been a pally myself, but I've grouped with a bunch of them.
If you want to have fun, try both and see which you like better. If
you want to be useful and desired by others, don't be a pally. If
there is a class that adds less to any group; I shudder to think about
it. Maybe SKs, but I doubt it.

Ogre. Troll regen is nice, but once you get past lev 25 or so it is
insignificant. OTOH, if you don't plan on going past 25 or so, troll
may be better.
