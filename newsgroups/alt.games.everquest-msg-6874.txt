I've been using an ATI Rage Fury Pro, and while I've only visited FV and
LoIO in Kunark, the only problems I've had with the Rage Fury was that when
there was a lot of Spell Casting, Framerates would drop BADLY.
I usually set my Particle Effects to MED.

My PC is a Celeron II 600 (OC'd to 730), 256 Meg RAM (recent upgrade from
128)

I just (yesterday) upgraded to a Radeon LE. (32 Meg DDR) You can get these
for under $80 US at newegg.com. They are an "underclocked" Radeon, 148 Mhz,
with Hyper Z disabled by default. You can use  one of the tweakers to
re-enable the hyper-Z (or a .reg hack), and to bump the clock speed back up.
I've read that they then perform as well as the full retail ($200?) Radeon
DDR card.

As mentioned, if you don't have an AGP slot, then you're a bit limited on
upgrade options.

Check out the alt.comp.periphs.videocards group and see what the general
consensus is for a decent upgrade for you.

Also check out sites like www.rage3d.com, and see what ATI owners are saying
about their cards.

It might be worth taking a look at the MadOnion site, and see how the
various cards are benchmarking in 3Dmark 2000/2001.

I've read that there is a Geforce MX that can now be bought for under
$100US.
I've also read that the 2D quality of the Geforce can be a factor for
someone who uses their PC for regular applications in addition to gaming. No
personal experience with that though.

With the current price of RAM, I'd be kinda silly to buy less than 128 Meg,
isn't it?

Good luck !
