Well, today will mark a full week since I installed Everquest Gold on
my PC.

It's been great fun all around, bringing back a joy I hadn't felt
since trying to understand the rules of Dungeons and Dragons back in
grade school.  I had a blast running around like a headless chicken,
trying to kill things, and running back to guards for protection when
I got in over my head.

But the best thing by far has been the other people.  My first (and
now gone, lost in a glitch) character, a High Elf Paladin, was only
out of her starting city for a few minutes when a kindly soul GAVE her
all kinds of ability-enhancing rings, bracers and earrings.  Another
new character, a Barbarian Warrior, was given a magical breastplate. 
Most of the new characters I've created (I've got three mains now,
between level 2 and level 5; a monk, a druid, a mage, and a warrior)
have been given very nice spell "buffs," all without asking.

Needless to say, I thanked everyone profusely.  I was always told that
it was no problem, and that no payment was needed.  That was really
nice of everyone I've run across.

EQ really is a nice place to adventure in -- so far I'm running around
solo trying to understand all the possible commands and skills, trying
to max out the ones that require little money (fishing, sense heading,
etc.) and fight monsters that won't kill me :)

I think I like the Druid best, although the Monk has been fun, too. 
The weight restriction is the only real downside so far.

If anyone here in this group has been buffing or helping newbies the
past week on Solusek Ro, please let me thank you again.  You've made
the EQ experience an overwhelmingly positive one for me.

I only hope that I can be as kind and generous as you all have been
when I am able.

This game, and more importantly, its PEOPLE (most of them, of course,
I can see why it's annoying from the posts here to listen to
characters shout for spells or money), have been wonderful.  I can see
why EQ is so popular.  If there's any complaint, it's the naming
system -- so hard to get one I like that isn't a randomly-generated
tongue-twister, and I can't wait until I can get a last name someday.

I do have two small questions, though, if you might indulge me.

Firstly, what should be the first thing(s) to upgrade on a Druid,
insofar as armor and weapons?  I'm not sure what specifically to get
after the initial club and tunic that would serve best in the short
term.

Second, is it worth getting the LoY expansion right away?  I like the
mapping feature, but don't anticipate using the Frogloks, so should I
wait?  And is it better to try to find the CD, or to simply download
it?

Thank you all in advance.
