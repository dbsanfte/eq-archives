This is a know bug in most dungeons.  Sol A and Sol B and notorious for
invis bugs....camping and coming back will usually fix it.

Also, this happens quite frequently on the boats to and from OT.   If you
sit still for a few seconds, you will blink out.....weird when you are afk
for the trip and come back and look around and no one is on the
boat....makes you think you missed the stop...lol
