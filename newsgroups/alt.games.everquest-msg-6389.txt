I always like that comusinst out look on every thing,  but here is the real
scoop, ALL people start everquest , equal your RL race , religion or sex do
not matter, this is a pure univers in which you can do well on not so well
its all up to you. I have few high lvl chars and all my tinker toys chars
start with nice gear, but above all all my RL friends start with good items
mage  all of the focus items by the lvl 6, damn the hardest thing for him
was going thru lava to the temple with out dieing. When I started the game I
had nothing, my warrior wear bronz to lvl 30 when he and a friend where high
enought to get crafted. But by playing wise and making good deal , I have
build a little empire that now has helped all my twinks and 4 RL friends.
Funny enought its like an investment, now when I log in there are people
with whom I can group always , I spend a day getting Summon corpses for my
39 necro but now I have a 51 necro friend and summon corpses any time , any
place.   I don't have to worry TP s, potions and REzes cause my real life
friends are clerics, druids, shamys , mages , bards and necros. Today if I
need to camp a strong mob or break the camp all I need is few tells.
Twinking and helping lvl friends is more then good for the EQ its good you
as well.
