Well, Najena is still down so I thought I'd write to say that this might
revitalise my interest in EQ2. I like the idea of solo instances; i missed a
few areas because i levelled past them before i got the quest for them or
because i couldn't get anyone interested in breaking away from grinding to
try them out, and i like the thought of finding 'rare' loot although i can't
really imagine what that's like.

We'll have to wait to see if this is as good as it sounds. Perhaps Lucy
won't take away the football this time!
