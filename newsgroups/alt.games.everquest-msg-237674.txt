/agree...When playing my Druid, I'll usually stand in one spot, hit my "Get
it off me" hot key and usually tank will get it off me no prob.  When
playing my Enchanter or Cleric, I'll hit hot key and if no one does anything
after a few seconds, I'll kite it in circles around the group and try to
re-mez/root.

From the other side of the coin, on my Warrior or Ranger it's harder to get
aggro if I have to chase them around the room.  If I saw you had it
seemingly under control by kiting the MOb around us, I'd just kill the first
MOb, then come get yours and not think anything of it.  Still seems a valid
method.
