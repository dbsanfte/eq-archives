Don't let the fact that it's not "uber" deter you... before posting on
alt.games.everquest, I posted on the (now sadly defunct) drinal.net boards.
It was all about my 20th level cleric going around doing things.  People
there enjoyed reading them, even if they were 30 levels above me - it's
always fun to see the same journey you took experienced through someone
else's eyes.

There were a lot of clerics who felt the same way.  The Ragefire camp was
*so* screwed up and caused *so* many stupid inter-guild fighting and
required *such* a hard-core commitment - people took vacation days from work
just to do the Ragefire camp - that a lot of clerics just decided not to do
it, ever.

Personally, I'm so glad they changed it - now more people can acquire it
without having to stay away for three days straight and without having to
worry about having Ragefire KS'd.  That makes it much more accessible.  I
won't disagree with folks who say it's too easy now, but anything was better
than the way it was before.

I'm with you there.  =)  I've avoided SF ever since I got my epic.  It's
just an annoying zone all around.

=)  That was my major stumbling block for months and months.

The Overking became much easier to kill when levels were raised to 65 and
people got the new spells.

lol

One of my most satisfying moments in EQ - even more so that actually getting
the epic itself - was watching Ragefire go down.  It's a beautiful sight to
behold.

I had a bard friend with me who immediately ran up and attacked one of the
NPC's at the inn so that she would be the first person I clicked.  =)

No need to apologize.  =)  I spent at least a week staring at the stat
window of my epic every chance I got.

Grats Darken!  I'm quite happy for you.  This will make a big difference in
your EQ existence - you'll find your quality of life has just gone up
significantly.  =)
