Sure, that's what they want you to think.  Start out making a few cheap fish
rolls, but next thing you know you're 20,000 leagues under the plane of
water killing a giant red con crab because you need to make that bucket of
crab legs.  I think tradeskills are fun, but some practical advice: if you
want to do more than make fish rolls, which is a worthy cause in itself,
then you might want to invest in a set of wis gear just to wear when
skilling up.  As always www.eqtraders.com is the place to go for answers to
tradeskilling questions.
