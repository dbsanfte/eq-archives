I think the bottom line is, hypothetically, if you always random, all 
will get as fair a chance as possible overall. Sure, some will say that 
there will be those who get far fewer than most and those who get far 
more, but the very nature of random minimizes that to a degree where it 
is a downside far smaller than that of other loot protocols. It is 
impossible in pickup groups to award based on what each person has won 
during all their EQ time. Also, there is no elected official to mediate 
any disputes. There can be no noble ruling that spreads all loot evenly 
in all situations, nor would I want it if there was. 

It really can't be disputed. Random is as fair as it gets.
