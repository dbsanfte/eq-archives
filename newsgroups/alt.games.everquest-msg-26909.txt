Well, pre-50, Shamans *are* the premier healing class in the game, but
not for the reasons that you listed.

Shamans have thier edge in damage mitigation.  When  you can slow a
mob's attacks, you're cutting the amount of damage they can do, and in
turn damage that is delt to your tanks.  In the end, a Shaman becomes
a better healer because he doesn't *need* to heal as much as the
cleric does.


Now, past level 50 or so, Warrior hit points go well into the "fucking
insane" range, making a Cleric's complete heal by far more efficient
to heal with.  Well, that, and most creature's magic resist falls well
into the "fucking insane" category as well, making it nigh impossible
for shammys to land those slow spells on many creatures.

They get all of four places to "port" to, they require a lot of time
and money invested into Alchemy, and it costs about 400 plat per port.
In other words, it's not worth it.

Res alone makes up for the difference, really.  In the high level
game, there's no two ways about it, you either have a cleric around,
or you don't hunt.
