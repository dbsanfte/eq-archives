	Oh yeah, got those...both a candle and a couple of fire beetle
eyes.  No help.  On my bf's computer, it can be dark, but I can still
see.   About the only thing I can see are the names over players heads
if they're close enough.

	I also forgot to mention that when I cast spells, the little
stars are inside black boxes.  When I casted Chant of Battle w/ my
Bard, I was just surrounded by these black boxes, again hindering my
vision.  So, tried focusing on 1H blunt instead and not worrying about
my spell, but again, computer is so slow that I have trouble chasing
the darn critters.  Accidently ran into a couple of gnoll pups and
promptly got...well, it wasn't a pretty sight, LOL.

	Yeah, since I've been playing more, I've gotten to know my way
around...well, I'm pretty good w/ Freeport and the East Commonlands.
Trying to learn my way around Qeynos at the moment.
