Thanks for the recommendations.  I've been dying to find something good to
read.  Lately I go to the bookstore and my eye just drifts over all the
books wearily - there's so much bad stuff that I'm afraid to try anything
new.  Recently I've been re-reading the Apprentice Adept series by Piers
Anthony.  An entertaining read if nothing else.

Here's my recommendations:

Steven Brust.  He's got a whole series of books with strange names - Jhereg,
Orca, Athyra, Issola, etc.  They're darned good.  Entertaining to read,
interesting plots, *and* it doesn't get bogged down into formula - each book
is unique.  Start with Jhereg and see if it doesn't hook you.

David Feintuch - Midshipman's Hope, Challenger's Hope, Fisherman's Hope,
Voices of Hope, etc.  A very interesting series about extremely strict
military discipline in the future.  Our Hero has more horrible things happen
to him than has the right to happen to any ten other people, but he keeps
going on - the discipline of the Navy he's in and his very strict religious
upbringing allowing him to persevere.  I'm not a big fan of stories with
military and/or religious overtones, but this one really got to me.  One of
those series I like to read over and over again.  He also has another two
books - The Still and The King - that are a *very* different look at a
fantasy setting.  Also very good, although your tolerance for alternative
lifestyles may be called into question.

Vernor Vinge has a compendium out with two novels sandwiched around a short
story.  The compendium is called "Across Realtime".  The first book, "The
Peace War" and the short story that follows it are only average.  However,
the second book, "Marooned in Realtime" is one of my favorites - it's a book
I've read over and over again.  I don't want to overbuild your
expectations - I wouldn't exactly call "Marooned in Realtime" a classic -
but it's a fun read that's easy on the eyes with some interesting plot
twists.

Give those a try and let me know what you think.  =)
