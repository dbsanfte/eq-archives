I think they should make more changes like mistmoore and I hope thats what 
they are actually going to do to freeport.
Even brand new players don't do most of the old content, there either aren't 
enough people to group with or the reward isn't on a par with whats available 
in newer zones.

I didn't much like the pull down menus in eq2 very much, i don't mind clicking 
on stones though, cause thats "magic" and i think the current system in PoK 
is a good enough comprise.
