Believe it or not, Pain and Suffering is actually a mob... There are other 
examples of invisible mobs in EQ, carrying out different functions, but I 
can't recall any of them right now... The thing is, since EQ is at heart 
nothing but a glorified database program, sometimes it's easier just to 
create a mob to do a particular task than to code the effect directly in 
the engine.

So, instead of hard-coding the whole "bleeding to death" thing, they just 
created an invisible mob that aggroes you when your health is really low... 
Or at least I think this is the way Pain and Suffering works.
