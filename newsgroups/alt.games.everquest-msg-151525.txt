While fighting in a group in SK, at the Splitpaw area, I acquired allot of
stuff that looks like it could be taken up to the Bazaar (since I'm close
by).  How much are they worth right now?

Preserved Split Paw Eye
Tanned Split Paw Skin (same graphic as a spell)
Tanned Split Paw Skin (rolled up...LORE item)
Tanned Split Paw Skin (looks like illegible cantrip from EC orcs)
Helle Splitpaw-Haut (looks like illegible cantrip from EC orcs)
A Split Paw
Gnoll Hide Lariat
Split Paw Hide Belt
Split Paw Hide Mask
Split Paw Hide Tunic

I think that is all.  Which ones are worth keeping & which are worth selling
to vendors (them horse human things)?
