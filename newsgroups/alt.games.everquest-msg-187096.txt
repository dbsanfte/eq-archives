Stuff that the game functions perfectly fine without, and has worked
perfectly fine without for the past 4 years. If you buy the expansion,
you get the perks. If you don't, you lose absolutely nothing.

It's not like you can't still obtain the spells in the exact same way
that they were obtainable before. In fact, they should be a little
easier to obtain now. Yes, "a little". Really, I don't imagine
skilling up research, scraping together the words, and researching
them is *that* much easier than hunting the mobs that drop the spells
themselves.

It's not like the existing content has been damaged by the LoY-only
features for non-LoY people. Really, has your experience as it was
before LoY been hurt in any way?

Damn the evil corperation for giving us reason to buy their
expansions!

Fucking whiners.
