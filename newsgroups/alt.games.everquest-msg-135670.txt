NewUI=FALSE in my init file.
VideoModeBitsPerPixel=32

Color on my Settings is also at 32.  It ried them both at 16, it didn't 
make a difference.

Nope.  :/  And what really frosts my cookies is that the game *worked* 
before this patch.  Aurf.

Oh yeah, I'm crawling all the tech boards I can find.

I suppose then the next question is, does anyone know how to overridet he 
on-board video card in a Dell Optiplex GX-1?  I think I'm going to have to 
install a new video card, since my 3D Rage Pro AGP 2x evidently isn't up 
to the task. :)
