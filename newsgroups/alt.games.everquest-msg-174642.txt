Once you get to 63+, shouldn't you expect xp to really taper off? I
mean, you're getting about as uber as it gets.

How did the heavy players make it through the trials? Couldn't the
others get together much the same as you did and get through them?

Not necessarily. As I asked above, how did the 63+ crowd get through
them when they had no one to PL them?

See above question.

Then why worry about it yet? If they are a liability in those planes,
why do they feel they need flagged? Let them go elsewhere if they feel
it benefits them. Sounds to me like they would get flagged and then
not be able to get a group in those very planes for which they are
flagged until they are of a more appropriate level anyway.

Bah. I'm not a big fan of PL'ing anyway, especially at such a big
expense of the PL'er. Like I said. Others have been successfully
flagged without being PL'ed, why can't they? Seems to me the whole
purpose of the trials is to ensure that only level-appropriate people
can venture into the uber planes. As I understand, there are already
zones with a level restriction to enter under *any* circumstances. I
see nothing wrong with that. Let them dine on their sour grapes. If
they are not willing to do what is necessary to join you, you wouldn't
want them in the first place.
