Try this; open up a command prompt and change to your new drive letter - or
you may not even have to do that.

Anyway, at the prompt type (I think this is correct)  "convert d: /ntfs"
and hit enter (or in place of d: use whatever drive letter that second disk
is).  It should give you some message about not having exclusive access to
the disk and needing to schedule it.  On the next reboot, XP should convert
that second disk to NTFS.

Just a question, why is it important to convert the second disk when XP can
see both file systems just fine?
