When you start an email or an IM window by typing "r" as the first char and
then realizing you have to bkspc to delete that.

When you look at people and wonder that their red, blue and yellow bubs are.

When you are working on a trade skill and start thinking, you know, this
would be really cool to try out in RL.
    "Honey, I want to put a forge in the basement"
    *Slap* is the response you get.

When you are driving down the road in your car and you think you are
crossing a zone.

When you look up in the sky and try and orientate yourself based on which
way the clouds are going.
