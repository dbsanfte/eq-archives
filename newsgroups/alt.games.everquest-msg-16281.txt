DT,
I don't know why you have your nickers in a twist on this.
It is fine for you not to join that guild.
It is fine for you to think what you like about them.
Hell it is even fine for you to post that you think that they are being
elitist and not very nice.

But what does any of it matter?
It is *their* guild.

You have been spouting off about how awful you think it is that they set
their own standards for their guild and then don't expect someone to
tell you to shut up ? Why should *anyones* opinions of if their policy
is reasonable, unreasonabe good bad or indifferent be of any consequence
to anyone ?

If I was starting a guild I would not use their policy. 
(I don't have a level 60 char)
If you were starting a guild you would not use their policy.
(for your own reasons)
But "they" started their guild with teir policies.
(For thier reasons <duh>)

The orriginal question in this thread (before the drift) was asking for
advice on recruitment methods and policies.

I think that AL's policy was posted as a bit of a joke since it is *so*
high level and *so* obviously out of context with the orriginal poster's
hope for a "large group of friends that like to play together."

Some people gave some good advice (like group for a few hours with
people before inviting, nominations to be tested in grouping before
recruitment, no spamming).

So I guess my question to you is why the hell have I bothered to write
this ?
And why the hell are you so up tight about a guild having a policy that
while you don't like it will not interfear with your play at all (as far
as I can see) ?

I guess I will stop rambling now, but can you and Stan end this thread
now ? unless anyone (including you cause you opinion is valid) has
anything positive to add.

Humm,
Guess I get flamed now :-(
Jim
