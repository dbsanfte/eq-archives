Speculation about release dates is almost always futile, nothing will ever
surprise me again about any particular result. Still, it's fun to speculate
based on available information.

SOE has contacted EB and notified them that the release date for EQ2 has
been pushed ahead one week (from Sep 14 to Sep 7). This kind of precision at
this late date often reflects a reasonably high level of expectation around
that date. We saw similar behavior in connection with the release of Star
Wars Galaxies when SOE notified retailers that the date had been set to June
26. After months of speculation by testers and the most adamant predictions
that the game couldn't possibly surface before the Holiday season, sure
enough, it was June 26.

Of course, even if the above expectation were high, something could still
come up to delay that expectation. But given the kind of marketing plans
that are likely to surround the release, the bar will be high and if you
look at SOE's recent history, even late breaking bugs in the test code
described as "total showstoppers" by many SWG testers (e.g., factories not
working) may not be enough to delay the release if they believe they can get
them fixed in production by the time of release. This has been true since UO
and continues today: beta testers are the last people on earth with a clue
as to when a game is going to be released.

Given everything I'm seeing now, including advertising in movie theatres,
retail communications, past history, I'm betting on the September 7 release
date. This gives them two and a half months to continue beta testing. I
don't think I'd be comfortable with that number, but unless you're in the
driver's seat it's hard to really assess what's a risk and what isn't.

We'll see.
