Hmm, I don't know where the source of the information we were looking at 
was, but I seem to recall making some of those inferences myself, from 
stuff people more interested in EQ2 were reporting about it.  Maybe the 
hints were being made more strongly than I think... or maybe I'm just 
easily suggestible and didn't think of the idea myself after all.

I think you mean something different by mature than I did... I didn't 
mean so much that people have level 70 characters with tons of loot, as 
that the game itself has been around long enough to be fully developed; 
a concept you explain far better than I do, later along in your response.

I agree that the existance of tons of maxed out high level characters 
isn't a plus for EQ1.

Well, they -claimed- that they weren't looking at EQ2 as a replacement, 
but as a seperate game.  If thats true, then their claims that they'd 
continue expanding EQ1 made sense.  But that doesn't seem to be how it 
really is.

This is what I meant by Mature: 7 expansions worth, not to mention 
freebie added zones like Stonebrunt, Warrens, Paineel, Jaggedpine, Sky. 
  It seems to me any game that comes out is going to have a hard time 
coming up with enough content to -NOT- seem small by comparison

I'm not clear on how the graphics engine is 5 years old.  Seems to me 
its been revamped not once but twice.  For that matter, whats to stop 
them making another revamp to whatever degree they like?  Maybe I'm just 
naive about how that works, but I don't see what prevents them 
completely replacing every bit of graphic in the game if they want, 
using the zone databases to draw all new models of every last blade of 
grass if they so desire, and manipulate them in whatever new ways they 
want.  Many of the other limits you mention would be a lot harder to 
deal with, but I keep seeing the graphics reference and it never makes 
any sense to me.

Then why aren't they marketing it that way?  Why are they being... 
backspacing furiously... pathetic dweebs who can't admit that EQ2 is the 
new direction they want to take us in?  Calling it EQ2 was a huge 
mistake if they are sincere in not wanting to tear down EQ1... but  a 
good call if they do... in which case they should be pushing that move, 
so as to get as many of the outdated EQ1 players to switch as possible.

Hell, if it was me, I'd be giving a free copy of the game to each EQ1 
player, and allowing them to move their remaining prepaid time over 
after a month's free trial.
