C. Heide mentions another possible option in passing here. The cleric
Blessing
line (Blessing of Piety up to 39, Faith up to 61, Reverence up to 65) all
give 10% spell haste that stacks with the spell haste you get from items.
I understand that many clerics skip this spell - understandable, since it's
relatively expensive to cast and the effects are subtle. But it can be
quite worthwhile, and if the cleric has buff extension AA it can last
over an hour.

I'll repeat one point - it *stacks*, so with a 15% spell haste item casting
time is reduced by 25%, reducing a 6 second cast time to 4.5 seconds.
(It doesn't stack with the group version, Aura of Reverence, although you
do get two spell icons that way.)

If you have LDoN, by the way, there is a spell haste 4 augment you can get
in the Guk theme.

Yes, the domain is sad, but effective. :-)
