Arms

Those new arms are nice (Transient) How hard were they to get ?


Back
Mystic looks a little poor.
I think I am going to try to get Ice Silk or failing that just get a 
Coterie General Cape (Which I can pick up for under 400pp)as an in 
between option I could go for Dull metalic.

Chest
Ice Silk sure looks nice but Im guessing that the cost is high.
I may get a Robe of Asylum as I can pick that up for under 1k

Face
The death mask is good. I have only seen that for a bout 3k (that is a 
bit much for me)
I expect that I will stick with the Fine cut mask for Spell haste 2 for now.

Feet
I managed to get a set of Coldain Skin boots off a friend, so the GEBs 
are the only upgrade I would think about atm.

Hands
The Beguilers are great, but about 5k I managed to get some imp skin for 
750pp, and I may go for Coldain Skin for about 3k. I also spotted the 
barging Iksar skin gloves at 100pp So that could be a cost saver.

Head
Again the beguilers look good, but a bit out of my range for now. I have 
picked up a Loam Encrusted and a Batfang head band (25pp !) which I can 
hot swap.

Legs
I'm starting to realise that I really need to sort my legs out.
Ediffers are definatly an improvement, how much were they / are they worth ?
Alternatives for me are Giant Scalemail or Loam Encrusted at 1000 and 
2000pp respectivly

Neck
I don't think that I like the Saphire Velium neck.
I think I can get a Stone Bead Choker for about a 1000 or Greater 
Talisman of Wistfulness for 400

Sholders
I guess more shawls are the way to go.

Waist
Im not sure that the spider fur is for me.
Im looking at possibly blood weave

Wrist
The bracelet of beauty is nice, how much was that ?
I can't find much in the way of mid range upgrades here.
I guess I will try to get an Unkempt Wrist of Apathy.


Any thoughts ?

Cheers,

Jim
