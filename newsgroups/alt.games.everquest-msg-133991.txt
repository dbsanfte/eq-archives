   Well?  True or not?  I know that at level 28 (just hit 29 an hour
ago, and haven't done any fighting) a good  90-95% of my mana was used
for heals when grouping with anyone in addition to Lenny.  It's
different when it's just Lenny and I... He likes it when I work on my
defense and offense, things like that.  But in a larger group, is DaIN
right?  Kinda wondering, because while I am playing around with casting
stuns, I don't think I'm doing much good with them.
