They come in the same spell level ranges as focus items, the lower level 
ones being cheaper to make.

Some of the augments only work in LDoN dungeons, armor, spells, procs on 
weapons, in general will work anywhere.  Some of the new spells are only 
useful in LDoN adventures, but, you can cast them elsewhere.  I am 
reasonably certain that the curse DoTs are general purpose, I know that 
the remove curse line of spells is general purpose.
