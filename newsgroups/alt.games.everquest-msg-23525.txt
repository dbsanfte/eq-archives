One thing you might want to consider is your other weapon skills. I also
don't know what a SBS is so what I have to say maybe a moot point.

We paladins have quests later on that require 2h slash skills. If you don't
have that skill maxed out or up to par, you're gonna miss alot. Case in
point, my 1hs is in the high 70's but my piercing is in the 30's. I had
Kodiak Claws, but it was only base damage of 7. My damage usually ranged in
the 10-14 (maybe a 15 once or so) at L15 I think. Now I have a 2h piercing,
base of 20 and do 20-28 (maybe even a 29) and am at L16. Big difference! But
here's the bummer, since my piercing is so low compared to 1hs, I miss quite
a bit more now than with the 1hs.

Bottom line, keep your stats up in your other combat skills. It sucks to
finally get a good weapon, only to miss with it a lot. You don't need a good
weap to practice with it. Even a rusties will work. I think you have to
fight something blue or greater, but I'm not sure about that.

Hope that helps somewhat. I know I didn't directly answer your question, but
gave you some other food for though.
