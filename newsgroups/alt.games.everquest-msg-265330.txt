   Maybe you could try reading the messages we write, right here in this
very newsgroup, before just making assumptions.  You're asking questions
that can quite easily answered just by reading this newsgroup!

   Some of the people I'm pretty sure don't play anymore (my apologies for
any misspellings)

Me (Annie Benson-Lennaman)
Ben Sisson
Foxeye
Dark Tyger (I think)

   That's a start, for you read on and answer your own questions.

    Some ex players do.  Most do not.  We played EQ for a long time, left
it for whatever reason, but are still interested in what is still the
leader of MMORPG.  Plus, we've made friends with people in the newsgroup. 
We like talking to them.  And we still like talking about Everquest. 
Again, if you have a problem with this, you might want to seek out a more
sheltered newsgroup.  I suggest you start the newsgroup
rec.games.everquest.live.active.players.only.moderated.

   Good luck with that.
