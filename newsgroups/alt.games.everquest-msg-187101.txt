Looking at the naming policy, it doesn't technically violate any of
the terms. Yes, it's a stupid name, but by the letter of the law, I
don't see how it's a violation. One might argue that, because it was
on an Erudite, it was a racial stereotype, but that would be
stretching.

It's one I'd *like* to see changed, but I don't see a problem in a GM,
who's there to enforce the rules rather than *make* the rules, not
changing it.
