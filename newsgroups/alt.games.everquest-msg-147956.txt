Anyone have a complete list of all the illusion masks for bards and
the levels they proc at?

I have the MoD from Lguk for my rogue got it at level 7 ( he is 11
now.. so no  proc yet) but my 26 bard has died like 3 times trying to
get that?

I had asked about the proc level on that mask and have been told 13,
15, and 25.. anyone know which level it actually is??
