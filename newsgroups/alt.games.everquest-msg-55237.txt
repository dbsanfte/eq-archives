There still should be some way to reduce the boat time from n. ro to
Iceclad main land.  You wait sometimes 5-10 minutes for the raft to come
from the zone line to
the dock in n. ro, then it sits there for several minutes, you zone into
iceclad, the raft sits at the zone line for several minutes, then it
goes to the island and you wait 20-30 minutes for the boat to show up if
you missed it which invariably happens, because you sat on the raft not
moving so long on zoning in.  I am not an anti boat person normally, but
the trip to iceclad is entirely too long.
