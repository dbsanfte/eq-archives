Closest I saw was:

"The chain acknowledges that many consider "Hooters" a slang term for a 
portion of the female anatomy. Hooters does have an owl inside its logo 
and uses an owl theme sufficiently to allow debate to occur over the 
meaning's intent. The chain enjoys and benefits from this debate. In the 
end, we hope Hooters means a great place to eat."

So they are not making an actual claim one way or the other, but are well 
aware of the meaning.
