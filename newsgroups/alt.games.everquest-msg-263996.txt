Already done.   A new set of valuable quested armor was added with OOW.

If the argument is that it should have been a mid level set instead, I have
to disagree.  That was something that should have been done three years ago,
but theres no way at this point to add sets of mid-level quests that could
compete with the bazaar.

Too much hand holding, to borrow a phrase used here recently.  While it's
true that some quests in EQ could use such help, those are just poorly
designed quests.  You should be able to figure out the next step from the
quest dialogue.   A system where you put little thought into the quests
beyond "run to the highlighted NPC and hail" is not a good quest system.

Both of these get a definite yes from me.

While its a nice sentiment, I don't see a way it could work in EQ as
currently designed.   Level differences mean way too much in terms of player
power.

Bleh.   The best thing they could do for the new players to make the game
easier is to roll back half of the changes they did the last round.  Undo
the Paudal Caverns experience bonus, and the "increased experience for
characters under level 10."   So newbies will actually have a chance to play
the game a little, before ending up at the more complicated higher levels.
Give them back corpse retrievals at all levels, so thier first few deaths
learning to be aware of where they died are in the newbie yards... not three
zones away in the level 11 hunting areas.

Necros can already summon corpses under level 30 for a 1pp reagent.

Eliminating corpse retrievals at levels 1-10 is what caused this problem at
level 11.    Giving 11 - 20's a way to avoid it by summoning to Shadowrest
would just be moving the problem to the 20's zone instead and making it
worse...  the best way to get good at doing CR is to have to do a few.   And
the best time to get those first few learning ones out of the way is when
you're level 3 hunting orc pawns in Greater Feydark, not when you're level
22 wandering through Mistmoore Castle for the first time.
