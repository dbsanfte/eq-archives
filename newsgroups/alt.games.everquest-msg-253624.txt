I met my wife in much the same way, on AOL in a chatroom.  We did take 
quite a bit longer to get to know each other, spending $400 to $600 a 
month on AOL+phone each for about 6 months, as well as one or the other 
of us travelling across country to meet each other about once a month 
during that time.

We've been happilly married for just over 9 years now.
