I don't know if it was the "ring war" but I was part of a triggered
event that tried to defend Thurg from an invasion of Giants.  Had
various waves of Giants coming from various directions.  Unfortunately
one or two broke thru off the last wave and got into Thurg and killed
whoever we were supposed to defend, so we lost.  But was great fun and
actually required some skill and group coordination  instead of just
zerging a boss mob.
