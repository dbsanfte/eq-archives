Oh my god. Now Books.

You could buy "Return of the King" without having read the first 2,
but you would be so lost,that you would more than likely stop reading
it and go buy the first one of the Trilogy or even "The Hobbit" to get
the Full Story.

.But you don't have to read "Hunt for Red October" to understand
 " Without Remorse".

But games are different, EQ and EQ2 are Very different games with very
different stories, And I willing to bet that you don't even know the
full story of Norath with out having to look it up.

Why were the kerans sent to the moon.
How was the hole created.
Why was Highpass Hold built.
Who Built the Druid rings ( and please don't say Druids)
Who built the Wizzard Spires.
Whats the deal with the Iskars and Sarnaks.
How about Vah Shir and the Grimmlings.
And why does killing spiders in DL affect your Mistmore faction.
Who was Najena and why was she bannish.
Why did Karnors fall.
Why is Burning Woods burning

Some of those are simple but I'm willing to bet you'll have to look
them up. So please don't try and bring story into a EQ discusion.
Most don't care.

Brother, most people Install EQ and boot it up and start killing.
I got to get to lvl 60 and be Uber.
And they have no idea there is a story and don't care about story just
stuff.

But I'm getting off track. It's basically proven market research that
consumers like new technology. If this wasn't the case we still would
be fawning over our 386DX PC's.( wow a Math co-processor)
Just because you like something doesn't mean the kid next to you likes
it.

But you even say "  I will have asked a friend or read a review, and
that may infulence my purchase in one direction or the other."
So you might acutally go to EQ2 if a friend tells you it's better than
EQ.
