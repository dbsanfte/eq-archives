Actually, they are still significantly better.
When you have multiple pulls in a normal exp group and you don't have
an enchanter, putting a warrior on a mob with defensive means you
generally don't need to worry about that warrior for a good 60 to 70
seconds.  Even then, you can start casting CH at 1 bubble and
trivially have time to get him back to full health.  That's almost if
not better than mez.

A SK/Pally can't do the same.

I remember one of our clerics was using nothing but the right click
*greater* heal stick from VP to keep a warrior alive while camping the
chef spawn in Sebilis.
