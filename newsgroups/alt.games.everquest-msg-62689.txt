Haven't heard much about this now but how are things on the Euro server? Has
the connection, or loss of improved? Is it very busy?
Just wondering, I assume things must of improved due to the lack of any
posts asking if anyone else was suffering whatever problems.

I see at least one "Uber" guild has moved over, Innit. Were there many full
guild moves to AB? It doesn't appear that United Kingdoms from Bristlebane
has done such a thing (although I have heard that they were all going to
DAoC and that doesn't appear to have happened)
On a side note, I see the leader of Innit plays a female rogue, anyone that
imagines the player to appear anything like the avatar would be in for a
real shock, LoL.
