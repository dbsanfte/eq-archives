My EverQuest 2 experience of late has been quite interesting in that 
I've been attempting to form a Guild, and finding out that it's even 
harder than I thought it would be just to get the required members to 
create it.

My gaming clan, the Loony Goon Circus (we rarely take ourselves 
seriously) have chosen to become multi-gaming by branching out into 
EverQuest 2, and now that a few of our members have access to the game 
we have started going through the process of finding members to help 
form the Guild officially (on the Lavastorm server). I anticipated the 
news of our background, that of Counter-Strike, would probably put 
people off due to the differences between the genres (we all have a 
fairly long history with RPGs, and also with the original EverQuest) and 
some people's mis/preconceptions about Counter-Strike players, but what 
I didn't foresee would be the difficulty in getting those who say "Well, 
I may be interested in a position" to actually sign up and join us.

My final problem is this...we have a fairly strict trialling process for 
the clan as we are something of a family...we try to avoid being 
elitist, but we act as all families do and we are wary of those who may 
have the wrong reasons for joining us (Maybe not the wrong 
reasons...more like, reasons which are incompatible with our style). It 
has occurred to us simply to try grabbing whoever comes along and is 
interested in Guilding, but how to build up a player base that is both 
enough to form a Guild, and also fits in well with our ideals and rules?

So, story over. Apologies for the minor piece of advertising in there, 
it's merely there for those who may be interested. I suppose the point 
of this post is merely to see if any of you have experienced this 
problem yourselves? Or have your own stories to tell about Guilds.
