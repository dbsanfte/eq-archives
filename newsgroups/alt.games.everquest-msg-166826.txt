I hated Great Big Sea when my sister started playing them, but then, she 
loves to overplay everything she listens to.  Think "I Will Always Love 
You" x 50 times a day... *twitch*  But then years later, in a theater 
work project, one of the techies brought tapes while we worked on sets.  
And I loved em.  Fun, swinging kind of sound they've got.

Nope, but gimme 5 minutes on IRC and we'll see. ;p
