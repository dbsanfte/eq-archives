I never suggested using the ME upgrade on top of 98. I don't think 
upgrading *any* version of Windows is a good idea. I am not trying to 
convince everyone ME is a better O/S. What I am doing is providing what 
I see as the only viable solution a person has to the sound problems 
with SB Lives, Win2k and EQ. If you think purchasing a different 
soundcard is a better solution then good for you, go ahead.

Also, I am explaining the reasons why I use ME instead of any other 
version of Windows, and considering my particular circumstances in 
regards to my hardware and my use of the machine I think its a good 
choice. It works well for me. If you don't agree then that's your 
opinion. Suggesting that I am "trying to fuck everyone around by 
knowingly making problems for people" is utterly ridiculous. Grow up.

Just FYI, I have used all versions of Windows starting with Windows 3.0, 
except for NT 3.X. I use Win2k daily as my desktop machine at work. I 
also admin Win2k servers at the ISP where I work, so your best guess is 
very wrong. IMHO each version has its good points and its bad points, 
but all are far from perfect.
