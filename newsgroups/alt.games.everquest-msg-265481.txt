He's talking about the NPC casino in shadowhaven.  You buy a ticket froma
vendor, and hand it in to an NCP for a chance to win rare items that no
longer drop.  Very very poor chances of winning, but at least it's honest.

Not one of the player run casino scams.  Those are run by scum.   They spam
everyone via OOC, then ripoff anyone stupid enough to listen.  They play and
win what they can, then as soon as anyone wins a significant amount off of
them, they fake a linkdead, log in a few hours later, hand off thier scam
proceeds to thier "real" character and delete the one they scammed with.
