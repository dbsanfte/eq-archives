Hi All;

I've never been to THE HOLE however, I have to do a CR for a guildie
tonight. The guildie was messing around that area with his Imp illusion and
when he zoned it was stripped from him and he took 20k in damage. I
understand that jumping down into The Hole will strip away most or all forms
of levitation and when you zone you land and die, however, can I put Devine
Aura or Devine Barrier on and land safely??

If DA or DB works will I be greeted by a bunch of mad mobs and not be able
to do a rez and wind up dead like him??  He is a 58 chanty and I'm a 57
cleric.


Thanks in advance for your help and any assistance with this.
