I'm not sure anymore, but there used to be programs that would click the ok
button for you and keep you online. That wouldn't work with DAoC since if
any program pops up, it closes, but it WOULD work with EQ. See if you can't
find some anti-timers for AOL. I know they've got to be out there. I'll keep
an eye out for one also.
