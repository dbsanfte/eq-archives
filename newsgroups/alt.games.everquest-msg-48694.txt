First off I am sorry to say you are not powerful enough to Solo the AC so
you will have to group. Hopefully you have some friends that don't need the
Ring of the AC. That being said The AC that spwans in Sro is 30-35ish and
hit fairly hard and in somewhat resistant to Magic. There are many different
veiws on how to get him to Spwan basically kill everything in the Desert
that moves. I have heard the AC is on the same spwan table as the Sand
Giants with a 5% chance of spwanning being there is no set location for the
AC to Spwan in Sro he is fair game and there is a lot of KSing.
AC in OOT usally long waiting list I personnally camp my main character at
AC Island and try to claim the camp when the servers come up from a patch.
To do this you have to be able to solo a 35-40 Cyclops or have friends that
you can call and tell them you have the camp. The AC in OOT is purely random
I have seen 3 spwan in 2 hours and I have been told there hasn't been a
spwan in 4 days. I have gotten 4 or 5 rings from OOT AC best times to get
the camp is between 1am and 5am mid week and be ready and willing to hold
the camp for at least 24 hours to have a reasonable shot at getting it. The
PHs are anything from low teens to mid 30s on a 6 min spwan table. They will
also wander after about 2 min and have a 30 min despwan time never timed the
AC to see if he will wander or despwan though.
At 32 might be wiser to purchase a muiltiquest or buy Travelers Boots
