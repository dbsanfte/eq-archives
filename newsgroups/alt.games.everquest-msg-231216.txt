Once you get to 62 and head to HoH. The GY there rocks solo. Although
I am a druid, I can say that for a necro aggro kiting there rocks. I
have teamed up several times with necros there, and it seems the more
necros we get there the more pulls at once we can kite around. Had a
group the other day with 3 necros and me (65 druid) and we were taking
3 mobs at once.
