If one wants to compare their game's downtime to other games, a good one 
to compare to is DAoC, because Mythic makes server population numbers 
available (both on their web page, and via XML to make it easy to use on 
fan sites or to analyze).  A couple months ago, someone started putting 
up interesting graphs here:

   <URL:http://daoc.darkzone.net/>

They have daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly graphs of population, and 
it is easy to see server downtime there.

Sony used to give server numbers, and there were sites with graphs like 
this, but around the time DAoC was going to launch, Sony stopped giving 
numbers.
