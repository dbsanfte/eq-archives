I'd agree with other posters that you should bite the bullet and use the 
Windows XP install as is on the new system. It will be less trouble in 
the end.

Having a second hard disk is a very good thing. I've used one for years 
now for my data backups, saved games from single player titles, all 
docs, downloads, patches, etc., etc. I just keep everything organized in 
various folders in the My Documents folder. So all I have to do is copy 
the whole My Documents over to the extra drive from time to tima and all 
the stuff it would hurt to lose is backed up. This also makes it a cinch 
when PC upgrade time comes as the spare drive has all my important stuff 
backed up on it. Pop it in the new machine, copy stuff over and voila, 
good to go.

The only data stuff that I needed to do something special with was email 
settings, address book and messages along with Web browser favorites. 
But these things I export to a folder in My Documents as well for easy 
retrieval in case of upgrading or disaster with my main drive. I think 
most email and Web browser software supports exporting all this stuff. I 
know IE and Outlook Express do, which was great when I decided to get 
good stuff and went for Mozilla! But that's another story....

As somebody else pointed out, you can copy over the entire EQ folder 
too, which is nice. It's great that they don't use the system registry. 
I wish more games would just save their own settings, etc. to their own 
folder like the good old days!

So with EQ and all your data and most important settings backed up to a 
second drive, the upgrade should be relatively painless.

Now for the fun stuff. What are you upgrading to?
