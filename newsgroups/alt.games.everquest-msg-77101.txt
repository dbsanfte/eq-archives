Not much of a hint.  It's the only way to survive, since if she gets the AoE
off twice (not counting the first blast sucked up by a paladin with DA up.)
you're going home in a coffin.  One or two tanks might survive, if your guild
is uber enough, but the surviving snarks will eat those two people alive.

The Queen fight was a blast the one time we tried it since I reached raiding
level.  (New chardok, Prince with 0 deaths, King with 0 deaths, Queen with
about 12 - 15 deaths.)  Nothing you can do but charge all out, swinging for
your life and praying.  32000 to 0 in under a minute is your goal... your only
goal for the moment.
