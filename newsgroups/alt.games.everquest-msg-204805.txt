    Exactly. It works as intended on Stromm - players go to zones to improve
themselves. They're camping the drops for personal use. On mature servers,
about the only loot players in that level range give a crap about is plat,
because you can buy stuff ten times better than the drops. My Bazaar mule
currently has the 25/48 two handed piercer off that big beetle in Marus
Seru, selling for 10 pp. 10 pp gets you a two hander better than almost
every two hander in the entire old world - why go there for loot? "Yay, that
Sambata dropped a Block of Acrylia. I'm done with the old world!"

    Yeah, I felt bad after sending the post. It was mean, and I apologize
for the tone. But right after I explained what was fun in the game, he goes
and says people will play only if the game is fun? It was like he ignored
everything he read, and threw in the standard casual player buzzwords to
make a stock response.
