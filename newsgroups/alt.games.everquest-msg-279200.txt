Frankly I don't see what the big fuss is all about.

I for one am not that excited about it. I don't think its exciting or 
even that revolutionary.

Yes, when I want to group with lower level friends it will be very nice 
to be able to join them. However, the reality is that I don't spend much 
time wishing I could be 20th level again. Its a nice option, but I'm 
hardly thrilled about it. And CoH's mentoring/sidekicking etc seems like 
a better system for that.

Same goes for when i want to play with high level friends but we're 
short a healer. Getting to spend the day as the healer is a nice plus 
because we're moving instead of being at a standstill...but if I log in 
each day and am pressured into being a healer because they need that 
more than a monk/rogue/bard/mage/whatever... I'm going to be pretty 
annoyed. If I wanted to spend half my time as a cleric I'd have rolled 
one.

Sure the monster missions neatly avoid imbalances in gear etc by 
standardizing what goes in... at the same time it neatly undermines the 
entire point of rpgs. If I wanted to play a standardized character in a 
standardized instanced mission I'd just play something else.

What's next?... EQ to have instanced zones with moving platforms and 
mobs that we can defeat by jumping on them...? For those of us who think 
the everquest engine is a touch staid, and crave variety... for people 
who think playing Mario brothers should somehow advance our Mains? :p
