Most people don't get it. I'd have left the little brat alone if he
had simply said something to the effect of "I think these changes
suck, I think Verant are idiots for doing it!". Even "I think they're
probably only doing this to sell more copies of PoP". BUT, what he
said was that the changes were "proof" that they're doing it to sell
copies of PoP. No "I think" or anything of the sort. He stated it as
if it were a fact, not a theory nor an opinion. THAT is why I barked
at him, THAT is why I called it exactly what it was: A whine.
