Only in name and stated purpose.  Aircraft carriers, et all can and do
play a distinct defensive role.  Aircraft are far better at patrolling
quickly and a carrier allows them to be based further off the coast (for
a broader defensive perimeter), away from civilians (safer in case of an
attack), and more mobile (making it harder for a hostile to target). 
Any nation with more then a tiny coastline could easily make a case for
the defensive use of carriers.  Equally, as you point out, they can be
used offensively.  Thus my point.

Peace favor your sword (IH)
