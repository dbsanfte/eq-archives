Nah... if they wanted to move pets between zones and the only thing holding
them back was the name issue, they could have they could have simply
followed the NPC pet system... and called them 'Soansos's pet
Jibtik'...since characters names are unique characters name + 's pet jibtik
is also unique. (provided characters aren't allowed to have the surname 's
pet jibtik... which they aren't)

At best the name thing was a 'tiny obstacle'. But more importantly... its an
implementation issue not a design issue.

There may  be numerous 'issues' moving an npc from zone to zone... but these
are all implementation issues. If the decision to allow npcs to cross zones
had been made in design then the implmentation would have ensured that was
possible. I recognize that it might be very difficult to retro-fit a feature
like this onto the game engine... but I refuse to accept it as anything but
incompetence that it wasn't designed-in in the first place.

If it had been a conscious desision to exclude pets from zoning during
design, then I'd accept it, although it would be nice if they had some sort
of logical reason for it... but telling us "Its hard to make npcs" cross
zones is just an excuse for why they don't want to/ can't add it... not a
reason as to why it wasn't there all along.
