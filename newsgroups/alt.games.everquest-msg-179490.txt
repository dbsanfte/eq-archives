    I understand the Umbral trains. People cut straight across the zone
instead of hugging the wall, and stuff never gets a chance to path away
because of how frequently new people (and new trains) arrive. But DSP to
Akheva? You hug the wall until you get near that final castle - nothing
aggros. Then you cut diagonally across towards Akheva. No traps, almost no
wanderers, you end up training the stuff at Akheva to zone (well, I do
anyways). I can't understand how you got so many bats, or where the hell the
vampires came from, following that route. Were there recruits there that had
never been to Akheva before?
