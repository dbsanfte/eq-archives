It's very hard to predict EQ's decline when it is still growing.  
One year?  Absolutely.  Two years?  Certainly.  Three years?  
Almost certainly.  Five years?  Probably.  Ten years?  Maybe.

The only real threat to Everquest is Everquest 2.  I think 
ultimately Verant would want to concentrate on EQ2 rather than 
maintain EQ, and would probably give incentive to switch EQ 
accounts into EQ2 accounts (sans characters, obviously).

Not while it's bringing in 3 million dollars a month, they won't.  
Don't worry about it.

Only if you take ten years to do it.
