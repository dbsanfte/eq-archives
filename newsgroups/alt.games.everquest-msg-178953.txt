Ok so you seem pretty bored of the Cleric class right ?

Your bored of buffing, then sitting down and watching the action from afar
until you throw in a well timed heal and sit back down ?

You enjoyed questing armour ?

Then my suggestion is ... Create a New toon.
If your suffering from Ihavehadenoughofmyclericitus then make a Rogue,
Warrior, Monk, Shadowknight, Beastlord,or Pally and get them some armour,
with a 56 Cleric you could easy get your SK a full set of darkforge, or make
some cash and buy him something else, then you would be killing 2 birds with
one stone, a whole new outlook on the game, a good head start on armour, and
the fun of questing it !

Or you could come PL my Cleric =P

and if you dont fancy any of those CIHYS ?

And on a side note I would go with the Beastlord, they are Amazing fun to
play, and easy to solo with high enough dps and good enough buffs to be
wanted in groups
