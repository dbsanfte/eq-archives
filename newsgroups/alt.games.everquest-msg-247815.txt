Hmm...no PoP, huh?

Temple of Cazic-Thule? Not sure how this would go for a necro at your level.
At least around the entrance inside, all are dark blue to me at 55. Hard
hitting, though.

The Hole is probably perfect for you. While most of the elementals at the
entrance are light blue to me at 55, many were dark blue at 53 and 54, and
deeper in, just about everything is dark blue to me.

Jagged Pine might be a possibility. Haven't been there since I retired my
druid, no clue how worthy a hunting ground it might be at 53.

Gunthak and Dulak should still be good experience.

Skyfire Mountains should offer some good experience as well. Just beware the
chromas - they dispell.

Probably other good areas too, which others will come up with. :)
