Okay, I'm fairly new to EQ. Just started the day after
Christmas. :) I've gathered bits and pieces about the
whole, progressive storyline from posts here, posts
other places, and just general conversation. From my
understanding (limited that it is), there is an 'ulti-
mate' killing that will bring on Armageddon, destroying
Norrath-as-we-know-it-now, correct? Has *any* guild
on any server made it as far as that last ultimate mob?
 From what I understand, no, it hasn't.

So, up for discussion is this: What, if anything, is
going to happen if/when that last ultimate mob is killed?
Or, even, what would you like to see happen?

Tracey
