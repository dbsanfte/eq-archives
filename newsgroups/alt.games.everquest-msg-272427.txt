I know quite a few furies that prefer soloing when they are trying to
hit a level.  This especially became true between 29 and 33.  They can
solo mobs that con orange to them and beat them down very quickly, and
get like 1/3 of 1% of a level.  If they have a goal to reach and it is
getting close to them quitting for the night, they will bail out of the
group early to go make thier milestone.

Solo'ing seems to be possible, even easy for some classes (monks above
40 are insane).  It just takes finding the right mobs for you to beat
down.  I think people who are claiming it is impossible to solo just
haven't looked for the right mobs.
