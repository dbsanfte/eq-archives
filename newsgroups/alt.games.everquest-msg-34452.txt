The original "Names names names" thread had considerable discussion on
this exact question. I won't get into lengthy re-hashing of it - if it
really interests you, you can read it there.

However, the short answers are:

1) It offends me when someone disregards the rules that apply to us
all, and which I am following.

2) Non fantasy names detract from the level of immersion, and hence
impact my enjoyment of the game.

Now, you may not believe or agree with either of those answers, and
that's fine. But I'll ask in advance that you kindly don't waste any
of my time arguing with me about them, as it's been done to death
already. Those two items *are* important to me, and that's that.
