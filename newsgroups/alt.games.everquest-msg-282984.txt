Hmm ... I had to dual box on a system where I had no 2nd copy of my eq- 
folder. All worked fine for me when I started Everquest just a second  
time.

And I dual box my EQ for some longer time (normaly with 2 different eq  
folders. All without any additional Software. Alt Tab, sound, graphics,  
... All works fine for me.

But my settings are all set to minimum. So no good textures or good  
models. Only my own toons have better models so I can see the horse when I  
am on it. (First I used WinEQ, but that is no longer needed. But patch is  
quite old. Over a year in the past I think!)
