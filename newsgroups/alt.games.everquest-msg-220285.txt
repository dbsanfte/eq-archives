I was thinking about ZEM's and how they create weirdness in the
game recently, posting in another thread.  ZEM created Paladul,
ZEM causes most zones to be empty of players, ZEM caused LOIO to
be the most crowded zone I've ever been in save for the bazaar
and a ZEM nerf has made LOIO one of the emptiest zones in the
game.  Most players seem to spend 99% of their time going to a
high ZEM zone, working it till it turns cyan, then moving to the
next, seeing perhaps 1% of the content out there.  And those few
zoens are nutso crowded, with the nasty killstealing and OOC
infighting you'd expect when there are a hundred people all
wanting the same 40 spawns.

Crazy idea occurs to me; why not have the ZEM tied to the number
of people in the zone?  The more people there are, the less exp
everyone gets per kill.  Highest ZEM in the game at the moment is
what, paladul at 160?  Lowest is LOIO at 65 IIRC.  SO, if there
are 6 people in the zone or less (don't want to discourage
grouping) the zone is at 160, then take it in steps of 1% per
person above that, meaning you 'd hit the floor at 95 people in
the zone... but would you ever really have to worry about that,
with the falling ZEM pushing people out to explore new less
populated areas?

The obvious drawback would be that perhaps harrassment would
become stratospheric as people try and get each other to leave
the zone so the ZEM would rise.

But its just an idea, someone hit it with a hammer a few times
and see how it holds up!
