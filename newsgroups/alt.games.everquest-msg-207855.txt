I certainly would expect better.  I have not measured my fps, but I am 
quite certain I would notice a drop to 4 fps, and have not done so 
anywhere in PoK.

My system:
PIII-1.2GHz
1GB 133MHz SRam
GeForce4 ti-4200 w/128MB of DDR, 4xAGP
120GB 5400RPM IDE HD with lots and lots of free space
crappy on board sound

I ran the same video and HD with a PIII-800 and 768MB of the same ram 
without that problem as well.
