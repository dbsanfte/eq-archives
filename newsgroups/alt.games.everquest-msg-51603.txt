	Ranger.

	Not even close.  You have most of the convenience spells (SoW, lev,
invis), you can forage so you can spend weeks out in the boonies without
having to return to town for food, and since they gave the class Panic Animal
at L22, a trained rhesus monkey can now solo one into the low 50s at least;
into the high 50s (if not 60) if you're psychotic enough to solo in West
Wastes.
