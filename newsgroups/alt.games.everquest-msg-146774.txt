Congrats Monual, I've been reading your tales here with great pleasure for
some time now.  I took the liberty of copying and pasting this one on my
guilds message board, as we have a High Priestess that has been waiting on
RF for about 8 months now.  I think she will take great pleasure in reading
the story, and she is well on her way to her epic now as well.  She has
collected her first shard, and will be in SF collecting more during the next
few days, with lots of guild support.
