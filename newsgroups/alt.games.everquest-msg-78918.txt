Skyfire works. If you pull them into the corridor to bw, they fear kite to
the north and you have plenty of space. Another good spot (youll need a
partner for this most likely) is just to the north of skyfire zone. Again,
they fear kite north (along the east zone wall)... and you wont be bothered
with adds here.
Burning wood also has enough blues to hunt at 52. The area around where the
path from DL comes down the hill, and running north past the western side of
the meteor, is a good place to fear kite, but not as good as skyfire.
I think your mid 50's pet drops in skyfire too (the monk pet?).
