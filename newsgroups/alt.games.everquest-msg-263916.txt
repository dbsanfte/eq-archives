How do you know they won't deliver? I'm really tired of all the whiners
saying Sony is bad. Sure they won't do it out of pur altruism. But is
making money such a terrible trait?

I don't mind Sony getting rich on my behalf if I can play and actually
like what I play.

They got massive feedback about the missing "magic" in their game. And
I'm sure it caused not only just one day overtime for the development team.

Agreed, it is sad that they didn't come out with this right from the
start. And they do argue that the original cookie cutter design was in
for testing purposes. Sure, yeah. ;)

But at least one could give them a little credit for what they are
trying to do. And this is trying to eliminate shortcomings of the actual
game. After all they do make that game for a living!
