The puller already has hate, by having pulled the mob.  They don't "boost"
the hate, they just trigger the mob's summoning ability.

In spite of that explanation, I get DS all the time when pulling and never
have a problem with it.  I've heard other monks tell magicians/druids not to
DS, but I've never run into a situation where it's been enough to start a
mob summoning.
