I know I'm digging up an old thread here, but having just read it, I
feel I have to point out a few inaccuracies:

This is just plain wrong. Wolf form resets you base faction to that of a
wolf rather than whatever race you are. Your religion and any faction
work you've done are then slapped on top of that. The result is often
that you become indifferent, since the folks you're conning couldn't
really care less who you worship but they are a little twitchy about you
being an elf or an iksar or whatever you happen to be.

I started out dubious to most ogres in Feerott and Oggok in wolf-form (I
was KOS without it). After much faction building I am kindly to Clurg
and amiable to the merchants and bouncers while in wolf-form. If I drop
wolf-form I am dubious to merchants and bouncers.

I beg to differ. I do stein runs all the time with my druid, since its a
helluva lot quicker than doing it with my enchanter. You just need to do
a bit of faction work first.

You don't need to be amiable either - you need to be high indifferent.
If Clurg responds to 'what barkeep compendium?' then you're in business
- he won't do that when you first turn indifferent but he will with some
more faction work without you actually becoming amiable, so there are
levels of faction that are important enough to change his response that
are still lumped under the same con.

Da Bouncers isn't the faction you need to do the stein quest, its simply
the faction you need to stop the ogre guards pounding you to a bloody
pulp while you do the quest with Clurg, who has his own faction,
'Clurg'.

If you're getting positive faction hits for the coalition of tradesfolk,
it sounds like you're handing the bread sack in to a merchant who is on
that faction (innkeep James or someone, I don't know). The faction you
want is 'Clurg', and the only way you'll get that faction from the bread
quest is to hand in the sack to Innkeep Gub in the Feerott. 2 levels of
handing the sack to some completely unrelated NPC in another zone isn't
going to make a blind bit of difference to Clurg one way or the other.
Give the sack to Innkeep Gub though, and you'll get positive faction
with the ogre merchants, the bouncers and Clurg.

The bread run is one way to do it without wrecking other factions.
Personally, I did lizard tail and lizard meat quests with the
Greenbloods to bring it up (you need only be dubious to start getting
positive faction with the lizard tails, enough of those and you can hand
in meat), as well as the bread run, hence lowering some other factions.
The ones I could care less about are easily repaired though. My wood-elf
druid may possibly never be able to set foot in the Grobb shadowknight
guild, but, well, so what?
