Hmm, you can kick them out, you just can't replace them.  On the other hand, if you
are in a seb Crypt group you can't easily replace someone either, and its worse
because you probably meant to be there for several hours.

Is there a penalty for failing a mission?  It seems to me there was some kind of
"leadership" thing that made it look like there was, if only that people could see
your crappy record as a leader.  If thats true, it will be even worse for the "lets
throw a group together and try something, no big whup" gamers, as they will
accumulate a "failed" score, and people who care about such things won't want them
even more than they don't already.

Man that last sentence is clumsy maybe time to stop wrapping sword hilts and hit
the hay.

Its funny, it sure looked like casual player expansion for once.  I'm funny,
hardcore about 4 months a year, casual about 4 months a year, and not online 4
months.  I'm still hopeful that I can make LDoN work as a casual gamer, but I might
have to switch back to my 65 cleric to find a group in any kind of short time...
that or if there's a real presence in the 20s, make a new character who's more
group desired than a mage.

At the moment I think its too soon to tell, but its interesting to speculate.

Splendid
