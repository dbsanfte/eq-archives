For BoT and HoH you just need to level.  Alternatively, there are two 
methods of getting flagged to enter those zones, I would suggest looking 
it up on www.allakhazam.com.  VT on the other hand, is a royal bitch to 
get access to.  Again, the information on that key can be found at 
www.allakhazam.com.
