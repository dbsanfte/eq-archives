Just looking for a bit of info on where I should head once I start killing
things in Velious, I have a 52 Warrior and shot his faction with everyone on
the continent and dont want to make the same mistake with my Cleric...

So before I go there I would like some peoples opinions on which quest
armours to start working towards...

I see the Coldain Shawl quests seem to attract a lot of Clerics, and Thurg
faction would be the easiest to raise, but would like to know which armours
in your opinion are the best for a Cleric to aim for

any info would be appreciated
