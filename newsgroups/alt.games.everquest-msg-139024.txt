/agree. As far as I'm concerned (mind > matter), so surgery is the 
correct approach to treat someone who has been born with the wrong set 
of genitals... of course, given that the operation is not exactly 
reversible, the patient must be dead serious about it. Someday medical 
technology will make a sex change completely trivial anyway, so we may 
as well learn to deal with the implications now.

self-styled researchers. :)
