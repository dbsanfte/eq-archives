This topic was done to death in a thread some months back, but
part of the problem with the "books only work at high levels"
idea is that many low level characters now belong to high level
players.  If the player has explored stuff to death, why force
him or her to explore again?  Just to limit the areas that are
easily reached for PLing?

But it's not just that.  As the world got larger and the average
level of characters rose, it became harder to find groups near
some starting cities.  The books make it easier for newbies to
find others at their level.

I do agree that the trivialisation of travel has its downsides,
but it does help in many ways besides just supporting laziness. :-)
