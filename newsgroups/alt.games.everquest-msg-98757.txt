I haven't tried it yet, but I'm starting to agree.
The amount of trivialisation is mad.
You end up with almost no down time from death and no xp loss.
Where is the stick to punish the foolish ?
Also where is the carrot to reward the cunning ?

Up to level 10 it no longer seems to matter if you are playing "well" or
"badly"

Not to mention the silly things that you can do.
Like getting bound in the middle of an orc camp (Gfay)
Just wait and hit attack on every now and then.
My cat can finally play EQ (to level 10)

Is that 6 rats for a 2 man group to both ding level 2 ?
Did you have logging on ?
Have you parsed it ?

Do you have parsed logs for this it would be very interesting to see?

Is that 3/4s of a blue bubble ? or 3/4s oy a yellow bubble ?
Soloing lowest level blues at level 13 I could get 3/4 of a blue before
the patch
Soloing high blues (4 levels blue) at 32 I could get 3/4 of a blue (out
doors) before the patch.

If you mean a yellow that is sick.

This would be great info to have.
I will try out my level 13 enchanter in BB tonight (if I can) and see
what happens with him.
