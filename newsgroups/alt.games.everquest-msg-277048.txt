How many games did it influence? How many games are there? Did it influence
one percent of new games? One hundredth of a percent? An immeasurably small
value, perhaps?

How does it rate being highly influential? I go to game shops all the time.
I see zero effect. And I don't see kids playing it, and my nieces and
nephews aren't playing it or a clone of it. At it's peak it had a percentage
of the market but nowhere near the effect roleplaying games had for example.

And at least it wasn't changing the rules as it went to favour richer
players.

We are talking about games which traditionally don't, which currently ban
people who attempt payment. We are talking about changing MMOGs so that rich
people get a sweeter ride than poor people, instead of having a level
playing field. The game in question, in the original post, is a MMOG run by
a company that is not currently saying payment is permitted. The point
raised by the original poster was how would people feel if the MS MMOG has
the same distortion that they are talking about introducing in a car racing
game; i.e. the car racer who coughs up extra gets a faster car than the
other guy.

Certainly, no-one is forced to play everquest, yet people have loyalty to
their characters, and will remain in a game even when they have stopped
feeling it is "fun". People will even commit violence over what happens in a
game, as happened recently. In this case, if people start a MMOG and get
attached to their characters, and then they find they cannot progress at the
same rate as others, then a lot will try anyway, even as the fun factor
fades and it becomes just another joyless addiction.

Recently serverwide announcements were made when certain goals within the
game were met. Some people did the in game equivalent of climbing mount
everest. They'll go down in the game version of history. At the moment i can
feel pretty confident they earned their fame, such as it is. Should these
changes be brought in, no-one will ever now if a guild defeated some god
because it was good, or just loaded. And people in countries with less
wealth than the US will have to either abandon the characters they might
have worked on for ten hours a day for years, or face permanent second class
status.

Ok, I realise you might have forgotten your medication, but that's not what
I said, intended, implied, suggested, deduced or inferred. What you just
brought up is a straw man argument, I don't have any opinion on this
mysterious "Them" (giant ants perhaps?) controlling computers. On the other
hand what I do care about is the subject of this discussion: that games like
Vanguard might introduce the same privileged game for the wealthy that
Microsoft has proposed to do with other games, and that once they do that,
other MMOGs like EQ might do so too. I think if we the players communicate
to the companies that we don't want this (and people have already done this
with SOE and it has stated it won't), then they won't introduce it by
stealth.

I don't think enough people will play in a MMOG to make it viable if they
know that they are just there to be the peasants. That's what real life is
for.
