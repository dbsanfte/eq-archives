Do you have any idea how CHEAP server drive space is?  This is a game design
decision, not a server cost one.  I don't like it (I'd like to see one
character per server, or 10+), but it's their game and they get to
maximize profit however they see fit.

That's a lot of code to write, test, and have absolute faith in it's
good implementation or you're open to massive hacks.  For a feature that
probably doesn't sell more accounts (there aren't many people who'd pay for
the game with unlimited slots but not with 4, and there are even some who'll
buy multiple accounts to get more slots). 

If online storage cost where the driving issue (which I don't believe), it
would be easier and safer to have SoE provide the backup space, and allow you
to mark characters as "please activate/deactivate", and have them moved
on/offline as a daily process.

Both methods have annoying versioning problems, where if you change a field in
the live game, you need to deal with it in your re-activiation code.
