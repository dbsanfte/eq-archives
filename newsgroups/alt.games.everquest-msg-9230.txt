Right.  You mean the two tear gas grenades that were not fired at
the building at all, fired at a different time than when the fire 
started and in a different place than where the fire started?  No.  
Firing a GS canister into Koresh's swimming pool did not start the 
fire. No. They had nothing to do with it.
