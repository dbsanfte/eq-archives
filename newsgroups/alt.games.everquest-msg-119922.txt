Be sure you have the NPC targeted.  Use /say (the default chat channel)
and not /tell.  Be sure you use exactly the same spelling and word order
of the bracketed text (there are a few occassions where this is not
correct, btw, but I can't think of any lowbie quests with that problem).
Try different leadins:
what [bracketed text here]
what about the [bracketed text here]
who is [bracketed name here]
I will [bracketed action here]
& etc.
Don't use the square brackets yourself, just the plain text.

good luck, and be careful not to attack the NPC by accident :)
