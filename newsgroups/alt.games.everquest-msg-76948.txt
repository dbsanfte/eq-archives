Good question, that's probably a factor of the throughput of the drive
adapter, the bus speed and the CPU.  I'm currently using a PII-450
with 256 MB RAM on a 100 MHz bus.  My two hard drives area  16GB and a
60 GB, both Maxtor commercial stuff.

I moved EQ to my second drive today and notice -fewer- "stuck screens"
in game.  Hard to be certain as my cable modem isn't quite as stable
as I'd like.  At least I only got disconnected once today.

Spinrite, anyone?
