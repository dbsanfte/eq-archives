That's kind of a circular logic though.  I.e, the skill is the most broken
of all, but no one wants to use a broken skill.  Therefore, not many people
use it.  Therefore, it's a low priority to fix.  I bet more gnomes would
bother with it if they could make more items, and if more of the known
recipies actually worked.  Or the results actually did something. 
Anything.  I guess that a few recipies make items solely to make the item,
like the catapult.  I've been told it does absolutely nothing.
