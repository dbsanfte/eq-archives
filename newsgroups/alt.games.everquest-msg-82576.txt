Louis, are you being deliberately obtuse or is it a troll? Or have you
decided to take up the vacuous nonsense of sanjian? Perhaps all that
time you spend underwater has caused you to have serious oxygen
deprivation of your brain.

Did you not read the rest of the post and the thread it came from? Do
you always take selected pieces of a post to set up straw men? Do you
have any ethical sense of what discourse is about? Or do you think
winning is the most important part of discussion? This lame, little
question of yours has been dealt with and finished several posts ago.

Were the earlier posts in this thread too many words for you to absorb?
Were the ideas too complex for your little brain? Did you try to read
this while sitting on the potty? Are not enough people paying attention
to you so you thought you would do something really, really
unintelligent and this would get you noticed?

Go away, tiny person. You don't think enough to participate.
