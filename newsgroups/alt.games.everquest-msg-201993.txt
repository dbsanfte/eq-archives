A basic description of the FX5200 chipset is here -

http://www6.tomshardware.com/graphic/200303061/index.html\

Benchmarks here:

Minimum prices at pricewatch are

$163 for a Radeon 9600pro
$ 77 for a Radeon 9200 with 128mb
$ 66 for a Radeon 9200 with  64mb

$163 for a FX5600 with 258mb
$146 for a FX5600 with 128mb
$ 68 for a FX5200 with 128mb
$ 59 for a FX5200 with  64mb

$110 for a TI4200 with 128mb
$ 87 for a TI4200 with  64mb

According to Tom's the 9600pro outperforms
the 5600 handily - so if you are looking
to spend around $175 you should get the
9600pro

There were no tests for the 9200, but the
TI4200 was basically outperforming the 
FX5600, so it's a no brainer that it outperforms
the FX5200.  That's for DX8 games, they 
believe the 5200 is simply not fast enough
to use the DX9 features it supports.

So, if you have around $100 to spend, the 
TI4200 128MB is probably better.  If money
is the only concern, they really liked the
FX5200 for the money, it is a MASSIVE upgrade
to the previous entry level card (the MX440)
and $59 is pretty hard to beat.  But I'd
also look for reviews of the 9200, since the 
price is around the same.

Before you get a new video card, you should
consider getting a new MOBO/Processor - that will
benefit you HUGELY - you can get an
2.2 ghz celeron with an ASUS board (mini-atx
but w/ AGP 4x slot, 3PCI, Firewire, and Lan)
for about $130 and 512MB mem for $50.
