Hmm, you'd think he'd have learned that taking the wisdom and mana gear
off increases regen, not putting it on

I mean, my naked WIS is 100, kitted out its 200.  When I take all my gear
off (assuming I never wear any +mana gear to simplify things) my mana
bar will fill up literally twice as fast.

Put the gear back on and I'm mysteriously at half mana, but thats clearly
just a bug

yes, I really do have a 100 naked wis and a 200 dressed wis...
and yes, I know what's wrong with my logic
