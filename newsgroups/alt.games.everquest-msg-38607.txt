I havent played EQ for a couple of weeks and when i tried today i had a few
problems.
When trying to run the game i got this message:
"Host not found" "No DNS entry for host" Now im not sure exactly what this
means, has the address of the login server somehow dissapered from some file?
it suggested the troubleshooting your connection in the eqmanual in the
everquest directory but when i tried to open this it told me:
"File MFC42.DLL" was missing. Im assuming this an EQ system file rather than a
windows one(?). I dont quite understand whats happened here because i have in
no way deleted or altered any EQ files the only thing i can think of is when i
uninstalled icq the other day it advised me that one of the files was shared by
another program and binning it could impact the other program, it seems
unlikely however EQ was the other program.
So im planning on running sfc and maybe re-installing EQ(should i do this over
current installation or uninstall and start from scratch?).
Anyway i just wondered if anybody had had this problem and knew how to sort it,
thanks alot :)
