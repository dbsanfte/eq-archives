As far as I understand from reading the changes, yes - you will no
longer have a 40% penalty.  Or more accurately, you still have the
penalty, but your kills generate an extra 40% xp, cancelling the
penalty.  Same for paladins & shadowknights (and bards too I think?)

So you *should* (if I understand right) see a 40% increase in your rate
of advancement.  Also, when grouped, you'll no longer suck extra xp
from the group & slow everyone else down, since XP distribution in a
group will now be done by level and not XP.

This really does appear to be a positive change for everyone.  The only
people not affected are those who solo and didn't have a class XP
penalty to start with.  Life will be the same as before for those
people.
