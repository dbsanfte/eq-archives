Before I start, I must admit that thanks to a number of lucky drops in
Warslick Wood (1 Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring and 3 Forest Loops) my
characters are "Twinked" in some ways (my Bard at level 40 has a
Thunderous Drum of the Karenas) and my 27 Cleric has a Book of
Obulus).

But why is it that every pickup group I join has characters so twinked
that the game becomes tedious for the rest of us?

Examples:- 

A level 25 Necromancer with (at least) a focus IV damage add bracelet,
A Free Thought something or other, a regen item and a dagger that
procced for 200-400 damage.

A level 21 Beastlord with 1300+ hit points, 1000AC and 2 hand to hand
weapons doing 80 damage each.

Its reaching the point where I don't want to join pickup groups. Maybe
its just me, but I would rather group with similarly equipped players
to myself, where everone in the group has something to do, and no one
character is so over equipped that the rest of us just sit and watch
(the level 25 necromancer was doing more damage than a warrior (with
Defenders Light Blade) and a paladin (with a Centi Longsword) who just
couldnt get the aggro back. Not that it mattered, with the regen and
life taps, the necro didnt need me healing while we watched him
killing giants in Frontier Mountains.

Yes I accept that the Book of Obulus, the Defenders Light Blade and
the Centi Longsword requires a certain amount of twinking at level
20-30. But at least they were bought with money earned with those
characters.

I also accept that neither a Paladin or a Warrior are known for their
ability to keep the aggro- but thats high level, not level 27.

S.
As I lay me down to sleep, 
I pray the Lord my soul to keep. 
If I die before I wake, 
I pray I have a recent saved game to go back to.
