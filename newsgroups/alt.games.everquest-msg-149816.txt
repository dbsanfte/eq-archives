The loot you want is called A Guard's Keyring, it is a single key that opens
both jail cells in Najena.  It drops rarely from ogre guards and seems to drop
much more frequently from Moosh, the named ogre guard near the prison.

Ekeros is about as rare as Rathyl is, so if Najena is empty I recommend killing
bonecracker and the ogre captain since they always spawn, just to pass time. 
Also you can kill all the deadly black widow spiders until the widowmistress
spawns and take her down, she's powerful for her level (moreso than Najena) and
procs very strong poisons.
