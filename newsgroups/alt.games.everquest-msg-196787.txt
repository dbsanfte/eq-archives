I also noticed this and got an idea.  It would depend on your 58 mage.  If
your mage was 49% or less of the way to 59, then the minimum he can group
with is 38th level (round down).  If he was 50% or higher to 59, then you
would round up not down and he can only group with 39.

Anyone else know any more about this fudging?
