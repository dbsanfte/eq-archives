Don't twink, of course, is one solution! Not that I'm against it, or haven't
done it, but it can be an idea to create a second character on a different
server. That way you have something to do when your main's server is down -
knowing as we all do that EQ'ers don't have a life outside of EQ :).

If you want to twink across servers then you can always use a newsgroup like
this to advertise the fact, so that your main can pass stuff to someone
else's second on your server, and he will reciprocate via his main on your
second's server. Just takes a little planning. I've seen that work between
guilds on Asherons Call, for example.

I have never had a problem dropping items, but always follow the rule of
only dropping one item at a time so if it goes wrong I wouldn't lose more
than one item, and I never drop a large sum of plats. You must, as already
stated by others, have both characters in the same place beforehand, and
don't chose a place where wandering green cons will interrupt your camping
as that just adds to the time delay.
