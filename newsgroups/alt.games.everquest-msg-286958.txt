Since Pris wasn't looking for a price to charge, but rather for which 
types to convert, I'd think a serverwide average would be perfectly 
adequate to the task... unless there's some reason a particular type 
would be valued highest on one server, but on another server be valued 
very low and a different one highest.

Only reasons I can think of for that would be the different rules sets, 
perhaps PVP would drive one price articially high compared to blue 
servers... I don't see why FV rules would change the order of preference 
(although they might drive all prices low, or high) nor why Combine... 
(well do they even exist on Combine?) would change order of preference.

At any rate, the populations of those special rules servers would be 
dramatically outweighed by those of all the normal rules servers 
combined, wouldn't they?
