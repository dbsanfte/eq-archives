The weapon stats are pre haste.  This is important because you
may have some better haste item that would supercede the haste
off the sword; if the stats were based on including the item's
native haste then the new haste would essentially be adding to
the existing haste, instead of merely overwriting it.

Also, the haste on the item effects you for both hands, not just
one; this isn't important for two handers, but for one handed
items, you may find yourself using an inferior weapon in your
offhand just because its a much better haste than anything else
you own and thus makes your main hand weapon better by more than
the degree to which substituting it for your nicer offhand weapon
penalizes you.

As far as I can tell, you'll never directly see the results of
any haste on your weapons;  not item haste, not spell haste, not
song haste; your stats remain constant and the only way you can
tell the difference is in how fast you actually swing at your
targets.

Oddly, you -can- see the effect of spell haste items and the
clerical "blessing of" line on spell casting times; it would be
nice if they'd extend the same thing to weapons so you could see
your weapon's current delay and normal delay both.. but so far,
this doesn't seem to happen.
