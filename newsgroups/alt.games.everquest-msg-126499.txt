EQbay is an interesting idea.  If you could make it so there were vendors
in the bazaar that sold things on consignment for you, that would be cool.
On the other hand, I'm not sure I want EQ to turn into a farm fest where
the whole point of the game becomes to kill as much as you can and sell it.
(Ok, don't laugh.  I'm sure I'll get a few replies saying it devolved to that
the day EQ came out.  I just don't want it to be worse in that way)

On my third hand, I can see that even with the new bazaar system now, there
will be players in the bazaar that will do the "sell on consignment" thing,
taking like a 5-10% cut of whatever they sell for you.  It's not a bad job
if you can get some people to trust you with some expensive items.  The cool
part about that is that it would require human-to-human interaction, lol.

Tip #1, don't make a DE rogue to be your consignment merchant... you might
have a hard time getting any business!  "What fungi?  You never gave me a fungi
to sell.  Be gone!.... oh ... you want to duel?  No, I have not the time for your
antics."
