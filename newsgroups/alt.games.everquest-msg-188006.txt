New CC works fine in other situations? Check with your bank, it is
possible (likely or not, I don't know, but possible) that the issue
lies there. Try, as another suggested, getting a gamecard. Hell, if
you got a friend that trusts you, see if they can re-activate with
their CC info (then cancel if it works, of course).

If it is on their end, and they're working on it, what more do you
expect a CS person to tell you than to keep trying? CS people aren't
the ones who fix that sort of problem, billing fixes it. All the CS
person can tell you is to keep trying, that in no way reflects on
their skill as a CS rep.
