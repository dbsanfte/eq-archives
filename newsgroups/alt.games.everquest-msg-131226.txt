}1. Is KC bad - I have been told I will be KOS to OT and the Oasis boat.

Mobs in KC do give negative hits with VenrillSathir, the faction OT 
Outpost folks are on, as well as those ogres on the island in Tim Deep.

}2. Is it safe to port to SFG and the usual spots?

Generally speaking, DEs of any kind wil be KoS in Surefall.  At least one 
DE cleric has found a way to become non-KoS there... if you searchthrough 
the archives of this group, you may find her story.

}3. I am still having to do 1 rez in each 12 hours of play time. Is there any
}way I can improve this at all?

Err... only one?  Did you want to do more?  Should I add you to my list of 
clerics who will come rez me? :) I can promise you, I tend to die a heck 
of a lot more than once in 12 hours. :)

}4. Suggest hunting areas if you want.

Sebilis.  I like Sebilis.  There should be more clerics there. :)  You 
never told us what level you are... If you're just starting to get KC 
invites, I'm guessing about 48-49.  Whereupon the world is pretty much 
your biscuit.  Velk's is good.  KC doesn't suck, except for that faction 
issue.  You might be able to get a group in maiden's eye.  There's a few 
other spots if you can bring your own group.
