Hello Everyone,
I started my Druid a few months ago and zoomed him to 32 by soloing,
only grouping him one time (in NoRo at level 13). Lately I have been
wanting to find some pickup groups to meet some new people and start
looking for a guild. To my dismay I can't seem to find a group
anywhere. I don't think I am flagged as a jerk or anything, as I am
always polite and helpfull on my server (Torvonnilous). Diminutive is
by no means weak, 205 wis with some great gear. And Halflings like
pie, so whats not to like?

So what gives? Do Druids stop being usefull in groups in their
mid-late levels?

Also, what would make a good partner for a Druid? What about a
Druid/Necro combo?

Anyway, sorry if these are silly questions. 

Thanks in advance.
Bryan.
