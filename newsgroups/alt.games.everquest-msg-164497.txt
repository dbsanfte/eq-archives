The thing to do is get a group of like-minded buddys to group with.
Once you have the group together, each can make suggestions as to where to
hunt that particular day.
Im guessing you are low-mid level, since you have only seen Najena and Lava
recently, so basically the world is your oyster. Check around the usual
websites, allakhazams, castersrealm etc, and find out what zones can be done
at your level and pick whichever takes your fancy.
Getting a group of friends together means you dont have to go to the usual
pickup zones to get xp or loot, and you can go to the zones that are bring
your own group, such as Kurns Tower (Low 20s), Mistmoore (25+), SolA (25+),
Dalnir (30+), Crystal Caverns (35+),  Lower Guk (35+). All of these zones
have some nice loot, nice xp and can be adventured through progressively, so
you arent just sitting in the same place pulling the same mobs over and over
again ad nauseum.
It isnt the most efficient way of getting xp, but the xp modifiers in these
dungeons are pretty good to make up for it.
