Congratulations! I was talking about this with a Guild mate of mine, and 
we were thinking it must be an absolutely amazing feeling to hit the cap 
in a game such as this, as we have never done it ourselves yet (I played 
EQLive but didn't build up much of a friends base on there, and soloing 
wasn't really doing it for me so I never progressed very far).

There must also be the weird feeling of waiting on new content, a cap 
rise, or just feeling you have little else that can conquer you, so you 
have the freedom to explore and take on the higher level aims?
