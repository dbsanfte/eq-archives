I think that to be able to pet pull, you need to be high enough level so 
they dont chain agro.
All the pet pull does is let you agro the mob without getting too close to 
the others.
If you were out in the open, you wouldnt need it, you could just single pull 
with a dd.

So no, I dont think it realy does enough to be called exploit.
