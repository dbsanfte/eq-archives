Only if you drive like an asshole.

To be honest, NO you really wouldn't go through tires any faster that
a honda, If, and only if the person driving the Performance car (new
or old) knows how do drive said performance car. The tires on my Stang
are 2 year old eagles and they still have a lot of tread on them and I
do like to speed around on the weekends, but doing burns outs for the
sake of doing them is stuipd and will get you a nice ticket if you get
caught. Parts and Labor are much much much cheaper on my stang than on
my 93' 240sx. Hell, mechanics charge you just to open the hood and do
a diagontic on it. While All " I " have to do is pop the hood on the
stang and see nothing but engine . 
HEHE Have you even tried changing spark plugs on a new car...can you
even see them. and get ready to bang the shit out of your knuckles.
OUCH, just the thought hurts.
