Excuse me?  The military isn't one large swear-fest.  I'd wager that there's
less vulgarity in my division than a typical frat house.  Granted, that's
not saying much.  I know a sergeant who can count the number of times he's
sworn in his entire career on one hand.  We're not all a bunch of
uneducated, ill-mannered, would-be convicts who had to choose between the
navy and jail.

It depends.  Colleges, these days, are nothing more than a glorified
vocational training school.  The days of a well rounded liberal eduacation
are long past.  One of the least capable people in my division has a biology
degree.  How that happened, I'll never understand.  Education, these days,
is something a person takes apon themselves, not something a school
instills.

I'm about as blue collar as you get; I play with lube oil every day.  It's
not always putting on airs.  I've noticed there truely is a "better class."
It's not based on the type of job you have, or your religous beliefs, but
rather, the type of person you choose to be.  Granted, upbringing has alot
to do with it, and someone from a family that instills those qualities is
more likely to belong to that "better class."  Let's not allow the tendancy
towards egalitarianism to blind us to the fact that some people choose to be
less than they can be, personally.

I would say, and uncomfortable idea, vice and ugly idea.  The niceties that
come with an othodox view don't always serve well when dealing with ideas
that make some uncomfortable.

Or a "lesser class."
