It was intentionally leaked by SOE weeks ago that the Warrior imbalances
*will* be addressed with the next expansion.  It's just not clear how yet.
I long for best AC and best taunt in the game.  At ALL levels, WITHOUT
having to use AA's to do it.  Folks tend to forget that there's 51 levels to
deal with before you get to AA's, and most people will spend months (or
years) in them.
