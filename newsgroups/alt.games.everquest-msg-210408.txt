Some time after releasing LOY, the good people at SOE realized that a good
"hook" for getting people to buy the LOY expansion was the cartography
function they'd thrown into the package.  They didn't put maps out with
the expansion, but players put them together pretty rapidly for most
zones, and with a map in place the system is really pretty useful.

But if you don't have LOY you don't find out just how useful they are,
because without experiencing the joy of the "GPS" effect marking your
current position on the map live and in real time, well, it doesn't sound
as good as it really is.

So they decided to enable the maps for everyone in the certain newbie
zones and cities.  Idea being for you to like it, then decide you want the
same function for -all- zones, and go plunk down the $20 for LOY for
yourself.

Of course they don't tell you that there are certain zones where it's
deliberately disabled, but you'd have to be pretty high level to even
think about caring, and even then, the only problem is you'll be so
addicted to the system at that point that you may feel a bit crippled in
those zones...
