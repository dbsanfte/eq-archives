Assume you are level 60, and can get any items you want. How would you
equip each class, or your class as you know best?

What armors, jewelry, sheilds, off-hand items, weapons, inventory
items would you use? No effort needed, there is a GM standing there
offering to hand you anything you can use, say for a PvE best of the
best type contest.

This type of thread has come up before, I am curious as to how peoples
choices differ with Luclin content availiable. Last one I saw was a
couple of months after Kunark released, and most of the high-end items
were found.
