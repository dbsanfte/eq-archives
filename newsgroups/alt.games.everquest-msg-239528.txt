For the most part the sum total of a bards equipment based damage
output relies on his instrument mod, probably his drum. While other
classes seek haste/str/procs/hp/regen etc to up their output and
others seek mana/regen/a plethora of foci/etc to up theirs... bards
just  need a new drum.

Give me a 1gp merchant drum, and I'm ready to swarm kite while I wait
for my rez. Bards aren't nearly as equipment dependant as the other
classes. And not being as dependant implies they don't derive as much
utility from it.

Whats yours? A warrior doesn't contribute to a fight via his spells...
Bards do. They chain cast them from beginning to end and then during
down time too. A bard is a caster first and foremost and his power is
measured by what he can accomplish by casting... not by his melee
ability.

Think about the total effect though. An enchanter can contribute more
slow, more regen, more haste, better stuns, longer charms... x15+

Even assuming Bards are boosted the same per song as an enchanter is
per spell its only x4 or 5.

Each time you give a minor change to a caster it multiplies 15 fold...
the same changes to a bard multiply 5 fold.

Imagine a trivial game with a 20 rocket missile launcher and a 5
rocket one. Now... assume they're trivially balanced... so the 20
rocket launcher does 2 damage per head and the 5 does 8. On a full hit
they both do 40 damage. Now if you increase each rocket by one damage
they're now unabalanced... the 20 rocket does 60, but the 5 rocket
does only 45. This  is what I'm trying to say about bards. Bard songs
are not dramatially more powerful than previous iterations to the
degree that they would need to be to keep up with the changes made to
other casters who aren't limited to 5 effects.

The same gradual increase gradually leaves us behind.

Plus a great deal of our utility doesn't scale... you can't be more
invisible than you were before =)

I'm not saying bards suck. They don't. They're very powerful in key
areas... but underpowered in others. It *is* a balance of sorts... but
its an unstable one, based on screwball factors... like equipment
independance...
