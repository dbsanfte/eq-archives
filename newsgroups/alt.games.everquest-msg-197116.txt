Well, I just changed my main to a Val Shir Beastmistress, Kashra.  She just
dinged 10th level today, and I've been having fun practicing my Tailoring
and Blacksmithing to the mid-30's.  I've managed to Tailor Studded
Hopperhide armor for myself, as well as a few handmade Backpacks.

The best part was being able to give lower-level Kitties full suits of
Tattered Hopperhide (since I can make it almost perfectly now) and seeing
how much it helps them.

Just like the help I've been getting, it was nice to finally be able to have
something to offer someone else!  A month in, and I'm still very happy with
things.

Thanks to everyone who has been helping others, so that you influenced me to
do the same!

Kashra, 10th level Val Shir Beastmistress on Solusek Ro
