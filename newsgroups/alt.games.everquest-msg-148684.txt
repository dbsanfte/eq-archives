The problem is nowadays there are so many programmers each given a small
task then its handed off to another programmer to merge everything together.
One programmer puts in when this set of  circumstances happens do this, and
another programmer puts in if this set of circumstances happens do this. Now
if these are even close who can say what's going to happen. Verant does not
take the time anymore to put a patch out on the Test Server and let it run
for a month before implementing the patch on the rest of the servers. They
use the test server for new Ideas not testing (IE Players can become Mobs on
Test a year ago or so).
