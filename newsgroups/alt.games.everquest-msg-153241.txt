I dual box and have a friend who recently started to dual box. He
asked me how I set up my second character, keyboard commands, etc.

I told him I don't use a keyboard for the second character I use a
Nostromo controller (basically mouse keypad combo). I told him that it
allowed me to set up better macros for the second character and was
much smaller than having to place to keyboards side by side.

He seems to believe that I can have my account banned for using the
controller. He said the software used to configure the controller is
considered 3rd party software that allows me to have an unfair
advantage in EQ.

I've used it for 2 months now and have never been contacted by a GM or
had any complaints. I use it with my Monk / Shammy combo so my monk
can practice skills over and over with one key press while my shammy
meds. He seems to think they will see that the pause between button
presses is exactly the same and ban my account.

I don't use this while afk and I don't believe I'm doing anything
wrong. If a GM were to contact me I could reply in the length of time
it took me to get to the keyboards ( seconds ).

Am I in violation of the EULA? Do they monitor our activity that
closely that they would figure out what controller I'm using? Do I
have to use a keyboard and mouse only?
