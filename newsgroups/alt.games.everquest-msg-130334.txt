 I'm pretty sure it's the same skill, just one happens to be a spell.
Fairly certain they behave the same.

 True. I don't like the wording of the original statement though since
the FD doesn't fail, it just gets broken. Same for AE spells hitting
you.

 Not true. Aggro will be transferred to the healer if it's cast on you
before you FD but once you successfully FD you're safe to be healed no
matter where the mob is standing.

 The list is pretty small. I've feigned off most things, including Vulak
(before his untimely 'removal' from the game), with no problems. The
main exception I can think of is Avatar of War. Once he turns on me I've
never once been able to feign him off.

 I'll second that. I've feigned off many things that haven't hit me
first.
