Yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head. There was likely no year
or more long planning phase of setting up where the server would be in
the uk, in seeing if it could be done, in moving it over there, in
leasing the space it would be in, in making sure it was hooked up to
verant itself and the area with sufficient bandwith, in training or
hiring people to take care of its operation over there, of setting up
the whole infrastructure, etc, but instead rather they just saw daoc
was coming out and some 60 th level mage cast "Call of the Server"
spell and made it appear there.

Just a little more thinking would have made this post moot.
