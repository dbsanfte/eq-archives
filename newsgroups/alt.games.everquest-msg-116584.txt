No, the end result spell scroll is droppable so you could buy it if
anyone had it for sale.

Tons of quest info here:

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=428

From memory The Great Oowomp in Tim Deep (first island you come to
from Oasis) is how Iksar do this quest, I've seen people do it when I
was camping him for xp.  He summons a skeleton pet which is amusing to
see considering he's a Shaman.
