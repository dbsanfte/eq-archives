Splitpaw was very sweet.... respawn was quick enough to make you have
to drive deeper.  
Runnyeye is an ok one... but the swamping of green agro got old quick.
Old Seb is an intereesting crawl... but because it a popular zone it
does not turn out to be a crawl... more of a camp.   Would be sweet to
have it all to yourself and your group.... work deep within.
Chardok would be another like Seb, but it just turns out to be a big
camp zone.


Any others?
