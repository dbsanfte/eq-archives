It can be tough being a guild leader for a mid level guild.  If you don't do
any events , raids etc, the guild will not grow. On the flip side,  if your
very active, what tends to happen is players use your guild as a stepping
stone to get best equipment available to that level range, to do Hate & Fear
, etc.  Then  they go on to a guild that can help them get epic,  then go on
to a guild that can help them get SoV aromor in ToV, then go on to a guild
that can get them PoP flags.
