"The sun does not move here.  Without that frame of reference, you
cannot tell what time it is."

OK...that's pretty lame.  First, my character has no trouble telling
the time in, say, Lower Guk, where I sure can't see the sun.

Second, even if the sun doesn't move on Luclin, Norrath rises and
sets...that could be used to tell time.

Anyone have any guesses why they don't want /time to work in Luclin?
