Stamina goes down pretty bad if you are swinging a heavy weapon. There are a
lot of lighter ones available now, but heavy weapons are why the spell
invigor is in the game.

I'd take a .4 weight weapon over a 2-8 any day, everything else being equal.

Which was right. Rangers are not a plate class which limits the availability
of good armor relative to the plate classes.

Maybe he was trying to dual wield while tanking. Maybe he wasn't using
snare/fear on animals. In general his comments are right about the functions
he talks about.

I ran/run my ranger like a chain wearing druid and do OK. I am a reluctant
tank. I accept this as a viable but narrow choice.

The original post was about the special abilities other mixed class
characters get. It just morphed into ranger vs. warrior as a tank.

We get track, they get harm touch and lay of hands. We get chain, they get
plate. I added that they also get nice weapons easier/sooner.

We get to fear animals while the SK can fear anything. This is like the
ranger taking a vow of poverty at character creation. There just aren't a
lot of fine steel drops off of monkies.

SK gets a pet. While it is is crummy pet, it is still better then the one
rangers get, which is none. They also get some serious DOTs and snare type
spells. Rangers get flame lick, whoop te doo! We don't get our next DOT
until 30. Burning affliction focus items don't even work with flame lick
which is kind of insult to injury.

It is a closer with paladins IMO. They get stuck fearing dead like we get
stuck fearing animals and no pet. The main difference is when tanking and
things go bad; the paladin is wearing plate, has better equipment, and can
use lay of hands to hopefully escape. The ranger mostly dies.
