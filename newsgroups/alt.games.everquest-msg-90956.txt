I give this rant a 4.2. Nobody knows who you're talking to. You're
assuming characteristics you couldn't possibly know. The rant reveals
more about the ranter than the rantee. I did give you a full 0.7 point
differential for lack of spelling, capitalization or paragraph
strucure, though.

On the plus side, the French ranting judge has inexplicably given you
a 9.6.
