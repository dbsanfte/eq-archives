That's exactly the hole I saw too. The government issues 'deeds' and 
transfering those deeds has to be registered with the government.

SOE holds the deeds to the plat, and explicitly dictated that they can't 
be bought or sold outside of the game... selling eq plat is probably a 
good analagy for selling leased car: you can't do it without involving 
and getting approval from the leasing company.

Technically speaking, the 'so called scammer' in this case is the guy 
selling the leased car.  The guy who offers to buy it, puts out a 
deposit, and then backs out and cancels his deposit cheque when he finds 
out the guy he paid doesn't actually own the thing in the first place 
has done nothing wrong.

In the case of the eq plat, he allegedly 'kept' the plat, which would be 
wrong...if he actually had the plat, but we all know the plat is still 
safely on EQs server, which is where it belongs... so he's got a leg to 
stand on in his defense. How strong that leg is remains to be tested by 
the courts... but I can at least see his argument.
