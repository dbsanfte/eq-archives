Ya know, he has all the indication of being a "mature troll."  The type that
says "anyone who uses ANY sort of curse word is obviously my intellectual
inferior.  Their viewpoints are OBVIOUSLY worthless, whereas I, who have
never used such vile and immature language in my life, am someone to which
everyone should listen."

You're damned close to being put on ignore.  Your greater-than-thou troll
attitude gets old very quick.
