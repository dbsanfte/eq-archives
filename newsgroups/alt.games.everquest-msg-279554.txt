/agree

I hear all the time, "Temp/Virt/Conv/KEI's up in 9 minutes. I'll be gating 
back for a new one."

I wonder how long it would take to get a group if you ooc'd, "Old style 
group now forming. Self buffs only."

There is a whole class of players who believe that it is their divine right 
to get their latest alt to 70 as fast as possible. If they don't have the 
highest possible buffs, they aren't going to play.

There is also the new people who don't realize how difficult EQ was before 
Sony softened it up. They don't know that they would have been fighting all 
of the same encounters with half the HP/AC/Mana that they typically have 
now. That only a couple of classes could heal worth a damn. That only one 
class had a rez, and it really wasn't worth waiting on until the 40s or 50s.

And don't you dare let either one of them die! One group seems to have 
forgotten, and the other never knew, that dying was a regular part of the 
game. It wasn't unusual to die several times in an evening if you were 
trying new content. Remember leaving corpses all over with one item on them 
hoping for a rez? There are so many clicky sticks now that it is rare to 
have to eat a death.

Ah well, the good old days. lol
