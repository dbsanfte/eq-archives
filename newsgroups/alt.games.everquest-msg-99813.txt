So....Lets say we were both wainting for a bus or something....what stops me
from looking at your shoes and seing a Nike, Vans, etc. logo on it ...yo
honestly think im gonna ask for your fucking permision to look at your
shoe?.......Inspect is just the same goddamn thing....I for one could care
less if ppl inspect and I inspect anyone wearing anything for any
reason.....Im not going to ask your your permission to "Open my eyes".
