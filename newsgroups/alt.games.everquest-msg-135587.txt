    You'd be surprised. A lot of clerics think they're wimpy robe-wearing
casters, and max mana over HPs. Add in the fact that some races, like high
elves, start with low STA and you can see some pretty anemic clerics. When
the other clerics heard that I hit 210 STA unbuffed with my new loot last
night (Shield of Ssraesomethingorother, OMG OMG OMG OMG!!!!) they were
pretty surprised. Hell, some of the non-warriors looked jealous! But I'm a
HP cleric, and I value being at 2500 HPs/3700 MANA unbuffed more than being
2100 HPs/4000 MANA unbuffed like others aim for.

    Oh, really? My fully-geared (but not ATK buffed) ATK is in the
mid-800's. So your ATK is 1700, is it?

    I know my melee is a pitiful joke, but I was surprised recently when I
was goofing off in Ssra. I can actually hit mobs like Elites for mid-40's in
damage with my 14 DAM weapon. I thought I wouldn't be able to land a thing,
and that if I did land a blow it would be for minimal damage. I was even
able to land a melee killshot against one of the Imperial Guards when we
were farming insignias - now THAT annoyed the melees!
