At least if you have an extended range item, it's pretty easy to do
that with a bolt spell. Used to annoy the hell out of me in OT with my
high teens lvl wizard. Nuke once then run after them because they'd
take off in the wrong direction. 

Even after the patch that supposedly fixed this, it was still
happening consistently.
