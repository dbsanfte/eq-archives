DL/KC would be a case of two zones connected by a
zone line, with lots of rich customers handy.  No
running FV to KC needed that way, just bind at the line
and always be ready to zone over if you gate in to trouble.

Better still, I occaisionally glitch there and -don't- zone, but
instead end up past the nominal zone line.  Thats an excellent
place to bind if you find yourself there, the mobs will -not- follow
you in, or aggro to you there, no matter what.  Unfortunately you
can't leave that little limbo without zoning, but you can talk to
people across the line and even join groups with them, I've recieved
(but obviously never given) ports while in there, and I've also
resed people who's bodies were on the other side of that invisible line.
