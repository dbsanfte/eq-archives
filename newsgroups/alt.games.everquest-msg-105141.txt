Just to be clear about what I did exactly, Cinbarra, my 35 wizard, was one
month ago, Cinbarra Uberfann...her surname was removed by a GM NQA, and last
week I gave her (the SAME character) a new last name using the /surname
command without any "clearance" or permission from anyone.  Her new surname
is in her little profile box and can be seen above her head in game play.
This is on the Mith Marr server.
