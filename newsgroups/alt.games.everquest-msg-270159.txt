Not technically but it always had a very good ZEM.  Making it a hotspot
doesn't make much sense to me.

Also one that had a very good ZEM.  I mean is the ZEM now 200?

Very popular for Necros.

Anything other than quest NPCs, merchants, and *Starting City* gate
guards, definitely.  They are still far overpowered.  But the guards
walking around in Kattta?  Sure.  Same with the ones inside Freeport
and other cities.

Can't make Rallic Packs or get a Shield of Bane Warding.  Why else does
this matter?
