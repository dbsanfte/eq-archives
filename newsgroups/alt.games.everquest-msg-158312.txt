Hello All,

I recently started playing EQ, and have gotten my halfling druid up to
level 18. Currently my armor consists mostly of Moss Toe newbie quest
armor, with some splitpaw hide gloves, Ulthork (is that right?)
sleeves, a gnoll fang necklace, and some earrings (I forget what they
are called - I am not at my EQ computer at the moment - they look gold
with orange stones in them) that I believe give +3 WIS each, a squad
ring, and various other leather pieces rounding out the set.

As far as weapons, I used a flail for a long time, until a couple of
days ago when someone walked by and handed me a smoldering brand. I
think that the brand will last me for a while, so I am not too worried
about that. I also have a velium great staff that I like to pull out
of the bank and knock things around with every so often. I completed
the stormreaper scimitar quest, but I find it does too little damage
to be of much use.

I was wondering what I should be looking for as far as armor and other
wearable things that would be better than what I have now. Also, I
currently carry a shield, but I would like to switch to something for
my non-weapon hand that gives me more wisdom or mana. I have been
looking at all of the merchants that I come across, and I have yet to
really find anything that looks that good for a druid. Are there any
particular merchants that sell good druid stuff? The cities of
Rivervale, Freeport, Qeynos, and High Pass Hold are where I have
looked for the most part. Would I be better off just going to the
bazaar? Also, I only have around 350pp right now, so I can't go too
overboard.

Also, my WIS is currently at 133. Is that about where it should be for
someone my level? My INT is still only at 69, as I don't yet have
anything that increases it. Should I worry about that or just let it
be for the moment?

Thanks 

Lenamien
