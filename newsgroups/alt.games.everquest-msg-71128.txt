Never thought twice about Gix, until I ported to WC once (at level 49), saw
a HG, grabbed a pet and chased the Giant. Somewhere along the route Gix
decided to help the giant out by attack my pet (probably because I tend to
sit down after sending my pet). Boy was he in for a surprise :)

Anyway, I didn't see the dragoon spawn after Gix's unfortunate demise. I
wonder if he's any harder at all.
