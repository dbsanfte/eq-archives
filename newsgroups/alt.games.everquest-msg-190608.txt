I use it, and I'm completely happy with it, except for the fact that its 
killfile is sadly way, way underpowered.  IE, I can't find a way to 
autokillfile threads that are, say, cross-posted to more than three 
groups, nor can I find a way to make it automatically ignore threads 
started by certain people - both of which would be very nice for dealing 
with a certain troll.
