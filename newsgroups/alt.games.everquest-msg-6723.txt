Yes there is a benefit, a Mob cannot riposte/block/dodge/parry from behind.
But you must be exactly behind the mob, if you are off to its flank even a
little it can riposte/block/dodge/parry.

I don't think Mobs have a lower AC from behind but I have never seen
proof of this either way. PCs definitely have a lower AC from behind
and can be stunned more easily from behind.

Mobs can spin instantly so the time it takes to turn around is not
an issue or advantage.

Nope it doesnt matter, as long as you are in melee range and not inside
the mob or too far above or below it. Of course mobs can hit things inside
them and at any height. =)
