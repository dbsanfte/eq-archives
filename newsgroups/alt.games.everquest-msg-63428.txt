Depends on what guild you're in.  If Ojayye Dajuice (erudite, of course)
wasn't in an uberguild my second petition wouldn't have been necessary.  As
it is, after 2 petitions it's still there.  And yes, in both cases I
petitioned and gave them the reason it violates TOS and is in bad taste.

Now, last night I saw Syndy Clawfjord...on a female troll.  Violates, but
isn't offensive at all.  I have to admit that I don't mind ...err, what's
the word..."ironic" isn't right, but close... types of names.  She's not in
an uberguild though, so her name would take just one petition, I'm sure.
