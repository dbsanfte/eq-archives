No, but they do have a copyright on Norrath, all the city names in the
game, their unique races and even their portrayal of the non-unique
races, the items and equipment, etc, etc. The non-setting specific
elements of the character concept are the player's. However, anything
else that is taken from the game and it's world are SOE's.
