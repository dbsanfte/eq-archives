My Donals BP cost me a whopping 9 points (items regularly go for
over 90 points in my guild, to give you an idea of scale.)

It seems the other clerics attending the raid "had better" with
the exception of one recently joined member, who didn't have much
to bid with.

A) I was still wearing a Hate Tshirt, this was certainly better by
any definition.

B) While they do all seem to have items with better stats of one
sort or another, I really can't think of a better clicky effect
than CHeal, even nerfed as it is, and I'm quite sure I'll have the
thing in inventory if not equipped for the remainder of my EQ
carreer.  Its just too nice to be able to click rez, click CHeal;
I'm twice as kind to dead people I don't know as are most clerics,
and I am at less risk after a self rez, and best of all, my guild
recovers substantially faster from a massive wipe, because I'm
walking thru the dead double clicking them all while everyone else
meds up to full.

C) Its not that ugly blue green shade that's so popular amoung my
peers.
