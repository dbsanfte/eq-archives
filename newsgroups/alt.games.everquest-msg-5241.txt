Jo,

I stand corrected :) I obviosly meant the "non-evil" route, since I
spoke of FV.

Instead head to Butcherblock and get the shuttle from the left side of
the BB docks out to the "big boat". I forget its name.

I seem to remember it being possible to switch boats as well in tim
deep? Am I wrong? It's been a while since I caught a boat.
