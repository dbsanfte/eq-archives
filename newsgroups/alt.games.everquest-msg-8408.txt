hi

i found out that using the

/wincolor chat <red> etc

command, you can change the colour of the background of your chat box in
full screen mode.

I want to change it to the same beigey colour that your chat box is coloured
when you are looking at your spell book.
That way, it will be a lot easier to pick contrasting colours for all the
different types of text message, as I would only have 1 background colour to
contrast against.

So does anyone know what the red blue green combination is that most closely
matches the text box background colour when looking at your spell book.


TIA
