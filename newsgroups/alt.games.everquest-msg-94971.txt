I did it with a 1st level Gnome, on a dare. I did die a few time, 4th
level is the time to do it too. People were shouting go gnome go!

The worst part was highpass hold. Karanas were not a problem but I
suggest you HUG THE RIVER TO THE SOUTH, the road is useless. When you
see the spires hang a left, and run to he big bridge. The basic rule
is if it moves it will kill you. Also, do not visit kith at night.
Just don't. Trust me.
