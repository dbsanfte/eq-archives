Hehe....almost funny.
I started playing games way back in the first Ultima online.
Death was HARSH there.   If you died, you appeared naked back in the city.
At first, ANYONE could loot your corpse.  Then after a patch, your stuff
just rotted.  Oh, big exp loss as well.  And, you were also able to kill
other players outside the city zones.  Made for an interesting game, I tell
ya.
Personally, I think the death loss in EQ is kinda wussy.  The MOST that can
happen, is lost time in regaining the exp.  From the sounds of it, in the
game now, people want a reward for dying....my the gods be insulted if there
is a penalty for death.
