One choice for just about *any* of those levels is Unrest. At least on my server
the place is almost always nearly empty. Right outside of there is Dagnor's,
where from 23 to 26 you could probably hunt aquagobs with zero competition for
several levels. Rathe Mtns also offers options from 15 to 26 nicely, with
everything from lizardmen and orcs on up to drakes and basilisks. That zone also
frequently has less than ten people in it. (Of course, for melee types it's a
huge PITA because you can't bind very close except in the Arena, and that can
still be quite a haul.)  Upper Guk is not heavily camped, though there will be
some parties running here and there, mostly going to/from LGuk. If you get a
good group and go hold a room with froggies you can get some non-stop action
there.
