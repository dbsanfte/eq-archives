Ok.  55 Necro here.  I've hunted in veksar before, but only in groups.
I'd like to try it solo.  So far, I'm 1 for 3.

(Skip to "Ok, my question..." if you don't want to read my story.)

First time out, I invis past the gobbies, head up the ramp, and begin
buffing.  I pull a crusader with slow, eat the HT, and begin killing.
MY pet can tank these rather well when slowed, BUT.  The crusader always
fears my pet!  So there goes Goner running headlong into the bloodgills
who, of course, come up to me and say hello!  I manage to FD him off,
mem Levant, wait til I get exp(*sniff* good old pet, fighting in
GLORIOUS BATTLE) and cast.

Ok, let's try that again.  Invis past the gobbies....and wonder why a
gobbie warrior saw past invis.  "Your skin stops tingling."  Doh...

Ow ow owowowow!  Leave me alone and I'll never bother you again!  No
such luck.  I start running back to veksar from PoK, and /corpse back to
the ent.  I res myself, and med back up.  Third try, I invis past the
gobbies, making sure to use normal invis.  Get up the ramp, and
summon/buff pet.  Pull, eat HT, pet gets feared.  #$%#%!  Once again the
gobbies send me back to PoK.

Ok, my question is this.  How can I prevent my pet getting feared?  I
have no SvM buffs to put on him, nor anyway to stun the mob during
casting(well, I *could* ST it, and wait for the dot to wake it up, but
that is a messy solution).  I just thought of something while typing
this.  Could I root the mob after it fears Goner?  Do mobs aggro on an
attacking pet?  ISTR they do, so this won't work.

Thanks.

(oh btw, this is Sukrarnil, for those in the channel who wonder wtf I
am.  Thanks for the breeze, Vsove!  Come over next time, and I'll show
you this killer emerald I found...*g*)
