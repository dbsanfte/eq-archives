I had this problem in 2000 with my Live, but only AFTER the Luclin
patch. The music started sputtering when the world would load after I
selected a character. Turns out my 256mb ram (even with all the new
textures and artwork turned off) wasn't enough and it was causing an
execessive CPU load. The problem immediately went away after I
installed an extra gig of ram. Now I can load all the artwork, and
there's only very slight sputtering when the world loads. It also
loads SO much faster. I think I'll max out to 2 gigs so the sputtering
will go away completely, and maybe my framerate will improve a bit
more.

Too bad EQ isn't designed to take advantage of dual processors, I run
it on a dual 800 p3. I might upgrade to a 2gig P4 in a few months just
to get smoother movement and less jerkiness in cities (especially Vah
Shir). Apparently, my GeForce 3 Ti500 with 64mb ram just isn't *quite*
powerful enough to handle all those textures, and my CPU isn't doing
enough to relieve the stress it's under. I also expanded my cache
space to accomodate my RAM, to 2gigs of space on both hard drives.

I love it when an expansion comes out and you have to spend hundreds
of dollars to fix the problems. Fortunately, I had preordered the ram
and GeForce 3 in anticipation of Luclin, not as a result of the
aftermath :)
