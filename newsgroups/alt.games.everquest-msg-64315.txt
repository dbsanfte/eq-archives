What a crap patch.  Been trying for hours and hours to patch EQ.  Keep
getting errors downloading files saying connection problem..or file
access..I've done every fix from the newsgroups and the official everquest
site and windows update.  I am so pissed.  Dark Ages of Camelot is pretty
rocking and most of my high level friends went there already.. I'm beginning
to think they bailed at the right time..cause I'm beginning to feel like I'm
SOL with the SoL expansion..arrgh.
