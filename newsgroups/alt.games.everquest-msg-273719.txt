I realise that your article is just flamebait, but the issue here is not
their vulgarity policy, but the random ways in which they enforce it. You
can and will see far worse than a differently spelled "pussy", even actual
character names, and nothing is done about those. While not native to the
English language and thus perhaps unqualified to make that statement, I do
not consider the word "pussy" (as in: "coward") an actionable insult/vulgar
expression according to Blizzard's own terms. So, in short, the issue here
is inconsistency and a lack of transparency.
