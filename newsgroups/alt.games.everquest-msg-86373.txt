Jewelry-made bracelets with +7 cha.
Froststone Stein from some named tentacle in CC with +10 cha.

Those are my main cha-gear items, the rest is stuff like a split paw
necklace (or the Shadowhaven's merchant faction quest result: +2 cha with
extra faction adjustion for bazaar, shadowhaven and fungus grove vendors)
some cha from my quest gear etc.
