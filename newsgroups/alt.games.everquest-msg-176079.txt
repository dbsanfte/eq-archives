This guy really needs to get himself a more wholesome hobby and stop
being so discriminant against people who are not Christians. It's
these kind of attitudes that cause the world to be in the state that
it's in. Religion does NOT affect destiny/afterlife......what will be
will be. Religion is what we have been exposed to dependant on family
and social exposure. If there is a god then he will take all these
factors into consideration and everyone will have the same ultimate
destiny. No-one will ever know what death is until they die. Just be
as good a person as you can be and respect your fellow living creature
and the rest will look after itself!!! Please just get on with life
and stop dwelling on things which 'probably' will never happen.
