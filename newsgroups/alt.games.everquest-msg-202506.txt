Damn just logged in after patch and thought I would head over to OOT. Whilst
waiting for boat at Freeport in the past I would start a fight with the
Grubby Rogue at the docks - she had enourmous HP and but hit like a pansy -
i would use her to skill up on weapons and usually boat would arrive before
she died her HP so enourmous - and I would have like 98% health. Well not
any more - she just gave me and pet an almighty stuffing in under a minute.
You have laugh but - damn u VI and your frigging patches and no KEI for me
at 43 - looks like skelly form from now on!
