Some valid points there, as a soloer I luckily find in Freeports Commonlands 
many others who are not just levellers and a quick ooc can either bring no 
one to a deluge.

I think extreme powerlevelling is sad and insecure not to mention tedious 
and misses the point of the game.

Some quest are tough soloing I just died in wailing caves (2nd tactician 
room) by three mean mother greyed mobs so I would of got no monster xp even 
though they were well tough?
