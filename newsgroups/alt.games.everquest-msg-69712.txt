My Vah Shir Beastlord was dubious or apprehensive around Qeynos (easily 
fixed by hunting Blackburrow gnolls and doing the gnoll fang and rabid 
animal quests). He was indifferent to most folk in Halas, which is nice, 
since they have a Beastlord guild.

Also, you have sneak, so if someone won't deal with you just sneak behind 
them to trade/train.

Oh, you're not KOS in Surefall either, so just get a port/bind straight 
there.

No idea about faction in Freeport but you're ostensibly a good race and 
agnostic, and they're quite a tolerant bunch (they let my Erudite necro 
wander around with no faction work). A bit of a trek from a trainer though, 
compared to Qeynos...
