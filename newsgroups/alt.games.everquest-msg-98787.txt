Why are you so concerned about other people?  I've been to EVERY pre-Luclin zone 
except for Sleepers, and I'll be there eventually.  I have been to at least 22 
of the 27 Luclin zones.  I AM running out of new zones.  You're not.

You are either a troll, or you have serious reading comprehension problems.  
Trivial Loot Code made it so that any lore/magic/no-drop items would ONLY DROP 
IF YOU WERE OF THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL.  In other words, it was EXACTLY what 
you're asking for.  The VAST majority of the playerbase hated it.  You've never 
experience those zones, you most likely have never even been to Odus, yet you 
continue to whine.

Yeah, most players of ANY level are sheep.  That's pretty much a given.  The 
sheep aren't the ones asking for new zones, it's the serious players who want 
new zones.  Those who try and do the biggish mobs early and often, who take 
pride in killing something with 18 rather than 30, who kill stuff before the 
strategies are posted everywhere.  Of course you haven't even experienced all 
the zones appropriate for your level, yet you persist in whining there isn't 
enough content for you, at least sheep are content being dumb.

I think you'll find that most of the high-level people here HAVE been to most 
of the zones.  Sure, not everyone sees PoM or ST or even VP, but those zones are 
designed for the 1%.  Why?  Because the people they are designed for are active 
players, who often have multiple accounts, and are the type to either recommend 
or warn against games.
