I have both a GF3Ti200 and a GF4Ti4600.  The Ti200 is fine.  Decent 
performance (~30fps) at 1280x1024, all Luclin models, clip plane maxed, on 
an Athlon 1.4 SDRAM system.  However, the 4600 plays at an even -higher- 
frame rate at 1600x1200, Quincunx anti-aliasing, all Luclin, clip plane 
maxed, same system.

Whoever said the 4600 doesn't have twice the performance only knows part of 
the story.  Most of the popular games and benchmarks only show an 
average of 50% increase over the Ti200, because that's the point where the 
CPU usage becomes the bottleneck.  However, pure graphics performance is 
much higher.  You can see this in the low-quality 3dmark tests, where the 
difference is 100% or more.  EQ, being an old game with a new graphics 
engine, isn't particularly CPU-heavy...just about all of the limiting 
factor is graphics performance, and it just -excels- with the GF4 card.

Is it worth $350?  Maybe not to you.  But you won't rip this card out of my 
hands until they're cold and dead, at least until something markedly 
better comes along.  Once you start playing regularly with anti-aliasing, 
you'll feel the same.  It totally changes the look of the game; I don't get 
texture flicker or edge crawling as I run or as the characters "breathe" 
anymore.  EQ's gone from a graphics cheesefest to a pretty sharp looking 
environment, and immersion has gone up considerably.

Geo

P.S. You can get close to the same results for $250 with a 4400 by 
overclocking it.  I just have a hot-running system as it is, and didn't 
feel like tempting fate.
