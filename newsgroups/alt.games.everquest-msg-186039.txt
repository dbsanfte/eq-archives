You got the answer, so I thought I'd add a little fact.  Messenger Service
doesn't advertise anything.  It's Windows way of telling you information
about what's happening on your computer that it thinks you might want to
know.

Personally, I never give a damn about what it tells me, but even so...! <g>
The first thing I do on all computers that I set up (I work in IT) is
disable it.  I'm tired of people complaining to me that their computer is
telling them they just printed a document (can't blame them, though...I
mean, duh).
