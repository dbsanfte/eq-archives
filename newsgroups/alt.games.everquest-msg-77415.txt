Just to be sure that you know Verant's official position on camping a spawn.
Nobody owns a spawn point, the first player to engage a mob is the one who
owns the right to kill that mob, nobody else, no matter how long they have
been sitting there is allowed to take it.  Now, for the unofficial,
generally accepted players' position, if you are camping a spawn point, and
can handle the mobs that spawn there, it is yours until you volluntarily
give it up.  Not everyone accepts that, and, when push comes to shove, it's
Verant's rules that matter in the short term.  In the long term, ignoring
players camping something will get you a bad reputation in game.

Now, to answer your question, you were right, and did exactly what Verant
would want you to do, you attempted to come up with a way to equitably share
the camp.  You did everything the way should have.  If a GM or Guide had
been there to witness what they were doing, ie training you, then they would
have been warned.
