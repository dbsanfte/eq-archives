As much as I regret agreeing with you on this, I think you are spot on
here.  This is not the first step, but it does seem to me that they are
now getting ready to bring in further  and further changes to make the
game "easier".  I'd often wondered how they were going to address the
issue of getting folks hooked on SWG who were already hooked on EQ.  Now
I'm starting to think the plan is to lower EQ to be playable by folks
who couldn't deal with it before, drawing in new customers to replace
the more serious gamers they hope to push on to SWG.

Of course I'm the guy who refuses to wear the tinfoil hats, so I might
have this all wrong.
