Both you and whoever missed the point of the post. His point was not that
cheap magical weapons were hard to come by, rather that lower levels did
have to resort to buying them. What he suggests is that there should be some
more thought put into the items (in this particular case weapons) that drop.
He suggests that there should be some low-end magical weapons that drop off
lvl 10 or so mobs, so that a lvl 10 or so character could acquire one
without having to buy it.

In too many cases, he suggests, is the loot that drops off mobs far below
the usability level of the person/group killing the mob. As he stated, he
DID buy a magic weapon long before he hit 22, but it wasn't until that point
that he actually KILLED a mob that dropped a magic weapon. So, in order to
go out and kill ghouls or wisps, a PC must resort to buying magic weapons.
This is where he is trying to point out the deficiencies of the looting
tables.

Of course, that is only what I am suggesting the original poster was
suggesting, but I think I am right and I agree with him. Of course, the
plethora of low-end magic weapons available at reasonable prices does allow
a low-level non-twink to avoid this. Think about it: how many people
fighting in Velious actually turn around and use those looted Velium weapons
(not including giving them to pets)?
