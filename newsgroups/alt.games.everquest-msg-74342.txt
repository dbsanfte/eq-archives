You should have a note in your inventory from when you were first "born."
Give that to the guild master that it says when you read it.  If you don't
have the note, no matter, all you get is a tiny bit of xp which won't even
move the blue xp bar at level 6, and a tunic which is worse than tattered.

As far as training and stuff, you can do that even if you don't turn in the
note.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
