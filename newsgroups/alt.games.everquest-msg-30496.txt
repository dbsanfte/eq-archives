I see your point and the only explanation i can come up with is that dump
trucks were built for the sole purpose of hauling gravel. I suppose the same
could be said about deep blue's programming. I think it boils down to the fact
that it is a mental challenge and we know we are at the bottom end of the scale
for physical prowess in the animal kingdom and as chess is seen as a game of
wits where we are undobtedly at the top people are interested to see if a
machine can surpass a human.
