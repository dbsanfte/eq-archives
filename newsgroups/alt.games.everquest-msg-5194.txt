Yes, if you plan on never using it. No, if you just can't afford one 
now, and plan to pick one up. It's very fast to train it up.

Absolutely not. The only time when fists start catching up to weapons is 
when you get your epic gloves

Epic Gloves only. They turn your fists into 9/16 weapons

Lemme see. My 2h blunt went from 0 to 180 in one evening. With 1h blunt 
you can use two weapons and train about 50% faster
