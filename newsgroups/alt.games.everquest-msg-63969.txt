Damn, I need THOSE?  I thought I needed the regular crystal silks.  ARGH.

You combine 5 threads to make whatever it is they make, right?  I'm guessing
you end up with 15 <whateverthreadsmake>?  I've got to remember to look that
up again.  Guess I'm going back to velks soon.

Tailoring is only at 105.  I can't bear the thought of getting it any
higher...it just hurts to think of all those DAYS /played I'll spend to get
it up from 105 to 150.  It's so depressing.
