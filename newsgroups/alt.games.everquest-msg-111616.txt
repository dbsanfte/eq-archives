do you use FAPS to measure FPS? any idea of your performance?

standing still in a corner while facing the bank near the Shadowhaven zone
line in Bazaar would get me like 8 fps with the Radeon 8500, and close to 16
fps with my GeForce 2 MX 200. (all settings maxed). with Luclin models off,
framerate jumps to 30-50 with the GeForce 2 MX 200. (i didnt turn Luclin
models off with the Radeon, becuase i expected it to do a lot better).

framerate is generally pretty good with the GF2MX200, but in some places
with lots of polys (buildings, lots of people in one area, etc) there is a
big performance hit (anything from 40-80 fps down to single digit
performance). i thought it was because of the card's tiny memory bandwidth,
and i thought something like a Radeon 8500 would be a perfect fix. it
however, performed worse, taking even larger performance hits.

i have WinXP, Celeron 1GHz, 768 Megs ram.
