My druid went in at 52 to do some CR, and most of the things he conned
(courtyard was the only time I had time to fiddle with conning) were white
or yellow.

It's not a 58+ zone though...not if you have a good, close group.  For the
blue/green pools or planks, a 55+ group will do fine.  I wouldn't know about
deeper in the zone, those are just the places I've been.
