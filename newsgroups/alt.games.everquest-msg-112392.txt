Ok. I thought I'd give playing a chanter a try. You know, something
different. Anyway, I got him up to level 14 now with only moderate
twinking (150 Int/126 Cha I think). Aside from having a little trouble
finding pickup groups as a pre-crack-distributing chanter, I'm liking
it quite a lot.

I would, however, appreciate some advice on spell loadouts and tactics
for both a level 14 as well as a level 16 chanter for when I reach
that milestone. I understand the buffing/debuffing aspect pretty much,
but I am having a lot of trouble soloing. Whirl seems to be the stun
of choice for this level, but it gets resisted A LOT and gets broken
VERY easily. Is the color flux spell still viable for stunning?

I would also like to be able to contibute a little more to my group as
far as offensive tactics go.

Any advice would be appreciated.
