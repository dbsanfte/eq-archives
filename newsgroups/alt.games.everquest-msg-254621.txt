LOL. Switching to a MMORPG opens a whole new can of worms with the wife. 
When I first started playing them years ago (Asheron's Call) it created 
much strife between me and my wife. Not only was I spending all my 
evenings (until 1-2am) playing, but I couldn't just stop what I was 
doing to deal with whatever she wanted me to deal with at that moment. 
It isn't like a single player game where you can just hit esc and pause 
the entire world, it keeps going.

Luckily, we worked through it and she could care less now. :)
