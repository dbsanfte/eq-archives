Most of my EQ time has taken place while watching kids.  Trick is
the word "supervising" which as you should know from reading
Dilbert, if not from personal experience, is the fine art of letting
others do the work while you serve as the brakes of the system.

Having worked as a sitter professionally (ok, it was my way of
earning date money in high school) I know that the real job is
to be there and alert in case of emergencies.  Kids are generally
quite capable of taking care of themselves with far less attention
than you would think, particularly with a range of ages.

There are things I won't attempt while watching kids, like raids...
but small group exp (me and my druid and monk friend) or solo,
it tends to work pretty well.  On rare occaisions there have been
disasters where a kid dropped a glass or something and I go
emergency AFK... but my friends understand thats part of the
bargain (in fact my druid partner is also watching kids on her
end, and the same sort of disaster occurs there from time to time.)

Luckily, even if a glitch like that results in a wipe, hey, there's a
cleric with a 96% rez handy, oh, and a druid to port him there,
invis him, SOW him, and generally make the CR painless.

I"d have to say that 75% of my EQ time, and 90% of my EQ
exp has come with at -least- my two kids under my supervision.
If you count kids asleep at night, make that 95% of EQ time and
99% of EQ exp
