Nothing on Graffe's about it that I saw, and I read there every day. If
that quest was solved, I think it would have been screamed out there.
I'm guessing it was just a rumor.

Dont' blame you. You can still get good xp for several more levels
quadding the ulthork hunters and warriors in EW.  As previously
mentioned, kodiaks are another great option. Stay away from the
shardwurms aggro, though. That will seriously mess up your day. Nasty
casters.
