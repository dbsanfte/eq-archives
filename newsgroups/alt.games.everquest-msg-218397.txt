Replying to the second person who asked me, to save myself time. :)

I don't see any particular draw for Davis either. I would have preferred
Bushmante over Arnold, though.  

Here's my sad perspective on it...when the recall first came about I
didn't pay attention too closely to *why* they wanted to recall
Davis.  WAs too busy playing EQ I suppose. :/

A few nights ago, before the vote, I started doing research online as to
what exactly I was voting on.  And while I found some lovely pages talking
about the propositions, and I found some pages talking about why Arnold
would or would not make a good governor, I couldn't find any decent
resources for why Davis sucked.  Maybe I didn't look hard enough, but it
almost seemed as if folks weren't really concerned with that part any
more...just were too excited about the bizarreness of Arnold.

So anyhow, I finally concluded that Politicians Always Suck, and that if
we recalled one everytime they sucked, we'd never get anything done
because we'd always be recalling.  As you may know, there is already an
effort going around to gather enough sigs to recall Arnold, after his
90-day grace period is up.

I think you forgot to mention Vanity. :)  People will do some pretty wacky
things to get attention and be in the spotlight.  Personally, I don't know
what his motivation is, and it's a little too late fo rme to start caring
now.  I missed my chance to make a more informed vote.
