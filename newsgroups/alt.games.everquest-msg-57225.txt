Agree. It will work, and I already know a couple people using multiple
workstations going through a router/hub on a single external IP address.
To answer the other portion of your question, however, yes you will need
to buy a second (or even third) copy of the game for you, your husband,
and possibly your child to all play at once. You can't log in from the
same account on two computers at once. 
  The bright side of this is that even if you all have characters on one
account on the same server, you can request to tranfer them, with all
their gear, to the new accounts after you establish them. The only
requirement is that they be transferring on the same server to an
account paid for by the same credit card at the same address.
Good luck.
