They just were not working, at all.

If you are a mage and are not using your focus items you better
take another look at them again. Especially the bracer and earring.

The earring saved mana on every cast of a nuke or AE spell. I can't
think of any earring in the game I would rather wear than that.

The bracer increases damage of DD nukes. When is that not useful?
Agian I can't think of any bracer I would rather wear.

The ring decreases cast time of all spells over 3 seconds. Ever just
miss casting that spell by that much >< ?

The neck piece has a chance not to use up a spell component. I just
swap this one in when casting buffs that use gems. Not a big deal
for a mage but this could be quite a money saver for clerics.

The shoulder item increases the duration of buff spells. ALL buff
spells. Basically another mana saver. When is that not useful?
I wear this one all the time but this could be swapped in and out.

Because Dire charmed pets can be about 5 times more powerful than
ANY summoned pet. Dire charms have ALL of the abilities, AC and
hit points of the mob that was charmed. That's HUGE! Now throw some
buffs on top of that! Toss in some haste and a damage shield
 and you have a killing machine. Who needs tanks?

Why not use it? Mana is mana. If you are logging out for the night why just
waste the pet when you can get some mana back for it? Also, you can cast
your pet spells several times until you get a higher level pet.
