I started a kitty bard, Meeowmix, last night totally untwinked.  Another
player passed me a drum and some lowbie armour and I hit the pit outside the
town.  Some loots later, I needed to sell.  I even had one last item on my
cursor.
I get to the merchant and can't sell anything because having something on
your cursor prevents the 1-20 box from coming up.  So, I dropped the drum on
the ground for a second and put the cursor'd item into my inventory.  One or
two items later I read, "Merchant picks up a hand drum"

D'oh!
I'd known but just forgotten.  Alas.
