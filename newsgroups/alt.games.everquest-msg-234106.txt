I agree with 4 and 6.
It is a bit of a change from soloing to grouping.
I have had minimal experience grouping and my partner had never grouped
before so it was a real eye-opener.
We work well as a team, but to see the antics of other players - pulling
before we were ready, pulling before we had finished of the first lot with
not alot of time to med.
I did make a point of asking what we should do however.  Still we had an
enjoyable experience, it was frightening at how many levels you can gain
over the course of a few hours.
