I want to start dueling my mage every now and then, to get away from the exp
grindstone. It would be pointless to duel if you didn't think you'd have a
chance in winning. My question for the higher level mages out there
is...What strategies should a mage use in a one on one duel? I need some
advice on dueling my mage against different classes ( tips for tanks, and
tips for casters). How should I use my pet, and what pet should I use?
Also, does giving my pet a summoned bag of armor increase his HP and AC?
Thanks for any help
