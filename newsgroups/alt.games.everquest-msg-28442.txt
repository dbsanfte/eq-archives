/agree

Also, *if* mana is in abundant supply, giant fighting is one of the few
times when tossing an occasional nuke as an enchanter is worthwhile.
Learn the times you can do so and not get aggroed on, and don't overdo
it. Your primary job is always crowd control/mana regen/haste, with some
backup debuffing (slows) as necessary. Since you can't mezz the giants,
your animation spells can also be used to decent effect (just don't be
afraid to let it die, and bring lots of tiny daggers if you go this
route).
