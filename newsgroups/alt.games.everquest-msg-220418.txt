Which group is it?

And how good were the DVD sales? : )   Honestly I was suprised it took them
this long to put out DVD's for it.   I know they were doing a few before...
but they wanted ridiculous prices.   18 bucks a pop for 2 episodes... which
would make each season about 216 or 234 bucks.  I love B5, but not that much
: P
