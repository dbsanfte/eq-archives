Well, I'm not sure if I would call it dead, I certainly never had a
problem getting a bind there, but I was also kiting in EJ a lot, and
often popped in there to med and go AFK.

OK, but it's still not much further from CoM to Seb than Thurg to
Velks.  About 1/2 of a zone, and EJ is trivial to travel through.

OK, but I still don't know where you're going to be in Seb that you
can sneak/hide in to get corpses, but won't have another group right
there able to help you guys out.  Velks is different, unless you're in
the pit, almost anyone can do CR for you.

Why do you need a ready-made group?  If you're unguilded I guess I
could see, but I even see pick-up type groups in SG sometimes.  Of
course if you're Coldain alligned, it's a long run through some
hostile territory.

You KNOW that Seb will not be empty, you can be pretty sure that
Chardok will not be empty now, they're both fairly close to melee bind
points, and have more killable mobs up most times than Velks does.
Only having to run there once shouldn't deter you.  It's not like
you're running to DN or something.

Lets see, I mentioned ToV entry mobs, but I guess since nobody can
bind in dungeons, that leaves WW dragons, SG if fighting at zone,
maybe some DN stuff, Skyfire mobs, BW mobs, hell, maybe even
Gorenaire.  Is VP an outdoor zone?  If so, this would be a big one,
bind all melee right there, have one or two buffers grouped with a
bard, slap a haste and a resist buff or two on the damage dealers as
they're looting weapons.  Oh, and PoM would be a hell of a lot
different then.
