ugh, the pickup group route for me has proved mostly succesful....but 
HUGE headaches can (and will) show up - much like last night

/rant on

forming pickup group, we have a cleric and a chanter, so on most nights 
a group would have formed fairly quickly.  wednesday night is just a 
little slow i suppose.

anyways, we form group after about an hour and a half.  run over to 
dungeon entrance, and while buffing, one of our players decides to hop 
on in before we're ready.  no biggie, things like that happen with 
first-timers, got to get over it.

we move in...3rd mob, the chanter decides to cast a little early, dies 
before anyone even notices, much less can hit a heal.  sucks for her, 
but we can move on.  next thing i know, we've been ported to Emerald 
Jungle by our wizard, who claimed he just had the wrong spells memmed.  
(by the 3rd mob, he should have told us to hold up so he could get them 
right, IMO).  long story short, he offers to port back to nro for us to 
continue, 2 of us ask to go to pok instead, i sell off the loot, 
autosplit, and disband - cancelling the mission.  sure, i took a hit in 
my won/loss record, but i wasn't about to put my fate in the hands of 
that group for an hour and a half - especially when victory was highly 
unlikely.

anyways, i probably overreacted, but it had to be done

/rant off
