I took a 'toon out into BB. Killed a giant bat and got a Basilisk
Eggs.

When I looted it, the main chat window had:

'Once again you startle as a loud hissing is heard. This time
though, it sounds a bit more pained. You believe the creature might
need help.'

First time I have seen that message. Other monsters who had basilisk
eggs didn't show that when I looted. I checked Alakhazam, nothing. I
did find Basilisk Eggs, but only as a drop by the lowland basilisks.

I did sell one for some nice plat. Anything else, besides food, they
can be used for or turned in ?

Thanks,
JimP.
