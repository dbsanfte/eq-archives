Actually that is not universally true for Windows. You are in fact 
permitted to move your Windows OS to a different machine, and to 
transfer it to another person.

Per Section 4 of the Windows XP Professional EULA, on *my* machine:

  4. TRANSFER-Internal.  You may move the Product to a different
     Workstation Computer.  After the transfer, you must
     completely remove the Product from the former Workstation
     Computer.  Transfer to Third Party. The initial user of the
     Product may make a one-time transfer of the Product to
     another end user.  The transfer has to include all
     component parts, media, printed materials, this EULA, and
     if applicable, the Certificate of Authenticity.  The
     transfer may not be an indirect transfer, such as a
     consignment.  Prior to the transfer, the end user receiving
     the transferred Product must agree to all the EULA terms.
     No Rental.  You may not rent, lease, lend or provide
     commercial hosting services to third parties with the
     Product.

I am aware the the 'OEM versions' of Windows are bound more tightly to 
the hardware. That right there is a good reason *not* to buy OEM 
machines imo.
