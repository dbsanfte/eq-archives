        With all this groups help my Iksar has finally grown quite a bit and
is ready to start putting together his Epic for the Spear of Fate.  I've
been doing most of my hunting in Kunark so very little faction has been
built up other then in Qeynos.  I'd just like to know what faction issues
may be arising with the quest for my Epic, and get any advice from the other
Iksar Shammies on this board.
        I've only seen the epic on a PC twice they were both Ogre's so I
know it's do able just would love the great advice I've been getting thanks.

Frederick.
