By 16 a Rogue should not only have DW but also double attack

If your friend hasnt trained either of these it might be worth while
checking she has trained hide and sneak otherwise evades not going to be
alot of good.

As a rogue its pretty easy to grab aggro, mobs tend to get pissy when you
take a huge chunk of health in one go (backstab) for some odd reason, maybe
you should consider rooting and throwing off a few FoL from time to time, I
always find 3 casts of FoL and it takes some awesome damage output to drag
aggro from my beastlord.
