That's an amazingly complicated way to implement a fairly simple thing.  You
just keep two seperate fields, one is level, one is xp.  You never reduce
the leve due to lost xp, you just reduce the xp.  You always use the same xp
requirements for levelling.  This would be one simple way to implement this,
there are others that are similarly easy, and do not add in the
complications that you do.
