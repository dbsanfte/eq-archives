That's a "mistake"?  You sure it wasn't a conscious design decision of a
company that knew they didn't have the resources to handle server-side
storage and would go bankrupt trying?

Not saying that's the way it was, but I can definitely see the possibility
for a successful, but still growing, company to make such a decision. 
Sometimes the beancounters *make* you accept compromises.  :)

That "hole a train can get through" never impacted my wife one iota when she
played Diablo, and she's still a big fan of the game.  I never much cared
for the isometic perspective myself, but still enjoyed the game for a short
time as a short term time waster.  Unlike my wife, my enjoyment of the game
*was* impacted by the hacking...  it was made better since I had no desire
to play the game "legit" and could see more of it in the limited time I
intended to spend playing it by editing myself in a couple toys.  :)
