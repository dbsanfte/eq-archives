I can confirm icewell keep has "draggro".  Saw someone with good
faction get smushed for dragging a corpse there.  Not sure about
Thurgadin, as I don't know anyone who has ever died there.


Also, if you're invisible, you can drag past mobs that do not see
invisible.  You'd think they'd be suspicious seeing a corpse scooting
across the floor under it's own power, but they don't.


Sometimes you can get lucky and move past them before they notice you,
but it's a crap shoot.  I used to drag corpses out of iceshard manor
(rif house in kael) and just dash for the zone if I got noticed.
