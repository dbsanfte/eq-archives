For main hand and two hand weapons, first look at (dmgx2+bonus)/delay, 
not dmg/delay.  For off hand, look at (dmgx2+1)/delay.  For most weapons, 
the amount of damage the procs add is not huge compared to the melee 
damage it does, but, aggro generated can be hugely increased with the 
right type of proc.  For weapons that have a +xxx, or bane xxx, that 
added damage is situational, for bane, you have to be fighting that type 
of mob for it to help, for +xxx it does a resist check against that type 
of damage before applying that added damage, so, depends on the resists 
of the mobs in question as to its utility.  I am led to believe that 
different weapons have different proc rates as well, which can 
significantly alter how useful the weapon is.  If two proc for the same 
damage, but one procs twice as often, then, obviously the latter would be 
a better proc in general.

Basically, when it comes down to comparing things like procs, you will 
have to either parse it yourself, or find someone who has.
