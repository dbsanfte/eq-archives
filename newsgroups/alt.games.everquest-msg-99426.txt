Well, anyone else but shaman maybe.  I would be very much surprised if
druids had any trouble soloing there as well.  I had no trouble soloing in
DL starting at 39.  I had to pick my targets, but I have soloed there off
and on for some time now.  I used root and rot pretty much exclusively when
soloing.  If I only used my slow (disease based) DoT, I could end the fight
close to full mana, depending on the number of resists.  Cann II plus Regen
is very nice, not as effective as a necro I am sure, but still very nice.
