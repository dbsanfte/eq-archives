My main concern is/was brand compatibility.  In the past I've always heard
that the brand doesn't really mean anything more than quality control, where
no brand means that just in case it sucks they don't want their name behind
it, but if they put their name on it that's because they do have at least
some quality control.

I've always heard Kingston is good RAM.
