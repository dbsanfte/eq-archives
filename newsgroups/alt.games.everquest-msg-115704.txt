Ah.  Had a bit of a horror story concerning this mob some time back.
He had been up a while when my little party of three arrived in the
zone and he'd wandered quite a way, in the excitement to try and get
to him I foolishly decided to move the party TO him rather than pull
him somewhere sensible.

Needless to say approximately 75% of the entire zone (*) added by the
time we actually got TO 'Mr Big Flower' leading to a rather nasty "ass
whuppin'" for the brave yet foolhardly adventurers.  Note to self:
undead care not a whit for Super Camo.

(*) Estimate.
