Does anyone with a laptop have an S3 video card?  I have a 16mb S3 card and
I get a lot of graphics errors.  A portion of the screen wraps over on the
right side, and there are some other glitches.  I know that EQ doesn't fully
support these cards, but some people have said they've found work arounds.
Anyone have any ideas how?
