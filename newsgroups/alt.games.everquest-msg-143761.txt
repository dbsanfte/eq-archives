Mask of the hunter is an outdoor only spell that lasts alot longer then Mask
of the Stalker and it costs less mana.  Mask of the Stalker you can cast
anywhere.  Most druids will cast POTC on themselves with Mask of "whatever"
then get hit with KEI, symbol, Focus, Stamina, Paladin buff Divine Strength,
and that shaman hammer buff from VP.  You can also stack a cleric AC buff
ontop of all that if you can find a bored cleric.

The best place for Dire Charm is in Chardok.  Other than that possibly
Maiden's Eye.  I really don't think it's worth the AA's though.  Before I'd
even consider this I'd have maxed healing adept, healing gift, mental
clarity, spell casting fury, spell casting mastery, combat stability,
improved natural durability, exodus, innate camouflage, and quick direct
damage.  In other words there are a lot of better options in AA there for
you.  Mostly in the 55+ Priest Archetypes AA level's.
