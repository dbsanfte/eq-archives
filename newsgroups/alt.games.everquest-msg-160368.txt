The price you can sell the HQ pelts for will vary depending on the type of
hide.  HQ cat pelts can be used to skill up tailoring to 115 with a 2 item
combine, so are desirable for that.  HQ bear pelts can be used to make
Handmade Backpacks, which at least used to sell for 100pp.  HQ bear/cat/wolf
pelts can be used to make reinforced armor, which is really only good for
skilling up, the armor itself is pretty worthless.  The Flawless and Superb
rockhopper hides are used for making some decent tailored armor, and can
command a pretty decent price.  To find out the price on your server, best
bet is hit the bazaar, and see what people are selling them for.  Do that a
few times, and you should get a reasonable feel for what they go for.
