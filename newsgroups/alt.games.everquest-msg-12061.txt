One method is to go buy up batwings and fishscales, kill DecSkels and try to
sell 'em off in areas like EC.  Some higher levels don't bother to get their
own and use a trickle-down economy to let the lower levels fetch those
things for them.
I, for example, would gladly pay 1 pp per asps poison sac in EC just because
of the tedium of farming my own poison components.  I'd rather let someone
who gets XP off the mob do it for me.

Identify a demand, and look to supply it.
