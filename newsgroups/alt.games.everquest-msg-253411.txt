who thinks this would be a good thing to add to game?

i think it would be great, seeing as periodically i whip up a lvl 1 nobody
give my 4 year old the keyboard and mouse than just watch her run all over
the newbie zone disrupting all get out.
I know in the way of tells this would be a great idea, so that when someone
is trying to chat em and getting nothing but
"abbbbbbbbbbherkjkkkkkkkkkkejshhhhhhhhhhhhh" in response they would know.
hey theres a "child at the wheel".

lol i can see it now, new catch phrase.

"Hey look, its another COW!"  let me know what you guys feel for that, and
if its good, i will send the idea to sony.
