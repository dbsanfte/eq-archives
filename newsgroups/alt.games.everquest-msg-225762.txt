L27 Ogre Shaman, worshipping RZ.

Freeport - 2 quests, Janam and Rebby.  These are side-by-side quests between
the Rogue's Guild and 2 NPCs at the Theatre in W Freeport.  Both quests are
multi-questable by drop and log with 2 characters on the same account.  It
takes about 30 to 40 cycles (if I remember correctly) to get to the point
where the guards won't kill you on sight, at which point you can do both
halves of the quest with your Ogre.  These quests have no bad faction.  (You
can check guard faction by coming upstairs at the docks and using Camera 2
to look over the wall at the guards.)

Freeport - 1 quest, kill a DE.  Bait Masterson spawns during the day along
the shore south of the dock in E Freeport.  At night, a DE female spawns
there.  Killing her gives you bad faction in Neriak and good faction with
the Wolves of the North (Halas guards).  I forget how many times I killed
her.

Blackburrow - wholesale slaughter of gnolls, good for Qeynos.

E Commons - wholesale slaughter of orcs.  This is good for Freeport Militia,
Freeport Paladins, HH Guards.  Very important, DO NOT turn in the belts.
You'll hose one or the other of the Freeport factions.

HH Orcs and Gnolls - Increases faction in HH and Qeynos.  Once you get
either Captain to Dubious you can start turning in the respective orc or
gnoll scalps and get higher faction faster.  Note the EC hunting to help
this.  Drawback:  spawn rates for both gnolls and orcs have been hosed.

I can go most places in Freeport (stay away from the wizard's guild and the
bards), everywhere in HH now, most places in Qeynos.  If I remember
correctly I was one of the first ogres able to use the bank in N Freeport.
I got a *lot* of stares.
