in fact i would never had noticed such a program was there unless i had the
error trying to modify my game options from the pre-login screen. anyway i
get the same error either from inside EQ or standalone.
but imho the fact i get a "MS VC++" error make me think it's not a normal
error from the game.
maybe it's linked with the fact i'm running 98se.
