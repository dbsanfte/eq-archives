My erudite necro is safe in Qeynos sewers, the run through Erudin to the
docks, All of Freeport, except some damn gnome near the bank (Zigg Flin
IIRC), all of Neriak except for the ghouls just outside the necro guild,  I
think the High Elves in Felwithe were dubious to him, Overthere outpost is
safe.

Halas hates him, Trolls hate him, Qeynos topside hates him, Dwarves hate
him.

I don't remember about Surefall, Rivervale or Kelethin, never checked ogres,
gnomes or FV in Kunark.
