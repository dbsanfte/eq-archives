I am switching to a new server with a friend.  We are going to group up and
try to catch up with other RL friends on the server.  So the question is,
what is a good pair?  He has his heart set on a necromancer and I am
undecided.  Starting off in the same city would be a plus, but not
mandatory.  Ideas that I have had so far:

            Gnome:      Necro / Mag
                             Necro / Wizard
            Dark Elf    Necro / Mag
                             Necro / Wiz
                             Necro / Enchanter
            Dark Elf Necro / Halfling Druid
            Gnome Necro / Wood Elf Druid

Ideas appreciated - just want to avoid Iksar.  Been there and done that,
loved it but looking for a change.

Thanks in Advance,
JerryD
