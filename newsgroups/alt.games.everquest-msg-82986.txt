Camo or invis definitely. As you look into the Rygor fort you'll be looking
at the main building, behind that building is a smaller one with a gate.
Inside the small building is a crystal on a pedestal. Click on the crystal
and you'll zone into the caverns. I've only done this a couple times so
someone else can probably give you more exact directions.
