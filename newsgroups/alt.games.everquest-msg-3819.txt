Do you sell old video games after you've become bored with them?
Do you sell your car when it becomes old or you simply want something
different?
Do you sell your house when you want somewhere different to live?
Or do you say, I'm sorry I can't sell you this car for a profit.  Or this
video game cartridge because it was fun once.

 I'll bet the ones complaining the loudest about selling anything have at
least 10 music CDs they have copied from the Internet or a friends CD.
That's theft of property.  However these people aren't making copies of
Verant's game and selling them, they aren't stealing anything.  They are
simply selling something they paid for,lost interest in it, and sold it to
someone that wanted it.

I seriously doubt any person out there is making a profit creating accounts
with players and selling them. lol

About a year after I started playing EverQuest I heard about people selling
EverQuest things on Ebay.  I couldn't believe people were paying for virtual
game pieces so I went to look for myself.  Sure enough there were hundreds
of pieces and even accounts for sell.  My reaction was what loser would pay
real money for an imaginary item.  My opinion is still the same about people
buying them.  I don't understand someone so busy they purchase an account
for hundreds of dollars but if they have money to throw away, let them toss
it wherever they choose.

As for the people selling items or accounts I don't think anybody is making
any profit.  If I were to sell my account for the time invested in creating
all of my characters and put a value on the items that's taken hours to
obtain it would be astronomical.  I don't think there's that big of a loser
out there willing to pay even minimum wage for the time invested making even
one character to level 50 much less 5 characters.  I believe people are
selling their accounts because they've become bored with the game, or
because Verant has changed something about the game that's made there
character boring or useless in the opinion.  I could compare that to GM
saying we want to recall your Corvette and put a 4 cylinder engine in it
because it isn't fair to everyone else on the highway.  But you must keep
your Corvette, you can't sell it after we nerfed it.

My response would be it wasn't a 4 cylinder when I purchased it and the
agreement was when I purchased it.  Now you have modified what I agreed to
so I'm not bound by your agreement.  That's similar to what Verant has done
to several classes namely necromancers were the first to get nerfed.  I'm
sure every necromancer was thrilled, bard's took a few hits next.  I even
know someone that completely stopped playing EverQuest because of the bard
nerf.  And the insult to injury was everything he had accomplished was
wasted.  It's not the money you get for selling your account that's the
point.  It's telling Verant you won't screw me over and make me take it.
I'll stop playing this game and find something else to do meanwhile take my
$50 and go out for a night of relaxation.

If I ever find myself in the situation that EverQuest is no longer fun I
will give my account to someone else.  Verant doesn't own my characters.
They are a creation of my doing, the achievements they have made are from my
creativity and are a reflection of my accomplishments.  I believe those
virtual characters should be allowed to continue on even if I don't want to
be the one shaping their future.  And if Verant is willing to keep the
account saved on a disk somewhere in storage that will be acceptable.  If
not I'll sell or give the account away to keep from having to delete
something I spent time making.
 It's not fair for me to be forced to pay $10 a month just to keep from
destroying something that's a reflection of me in some form.

   What's equally mind boggling is that people will get verbally violent and
probably physically violent if they know who you are because you don't agree
with them in a newsgroup.

That just shows their immaturity.
