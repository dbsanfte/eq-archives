If you were sold that item by someone who told you that you could use it to
hold all the keys you acquire in the game, then you've been had. As others
have said, that's done automatically in the game. I'm not sure what the
intended purpose is for that item but it sounds like it's not what you
thought. Get your money back if you can.
