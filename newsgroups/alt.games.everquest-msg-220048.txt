Yep...I've had this happen quite a few times...had some random person walk
up to me the other day by the PoK bank..."Hello sir, can I borrow your
Soulstripper for a few minutes so I can take a screenshot with it?"

WTF???  Then he kept bugging me after I told him no...very politely even.
Had to /ignore him.
