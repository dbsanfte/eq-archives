Oh calm yourself. ;) It's not like I'm plotting the demise of EQ or
anything. If EQ continues to do well more power to it, I'm just noticing
that a goofy game about people in tights seems to be having more luck
attracting folks away from EQ than other MMORPGs did.  It's just an
observation, not a prediction.

And in any case, I'm not burned out on EQ.   Because some folks who quit
may be burned out - don't assume EVERYONE is. ;)
