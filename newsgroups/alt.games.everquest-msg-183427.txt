Havent used it yet, because I havent gotten home yet to check it
out.... but how bout not puting the ones in from the Zip, that are
already supplied by SOE?  that way you will not see the conflict
between the two, and you will be able to get the info for the zones
you dont have.

ready to explore Gunthak, but still want a map..  8 )
