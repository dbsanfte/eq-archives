As you found, generating data on faction hits isn't easy.  You have
to get to the boundary between two /con responses, then go back and
forth across the boundary, and even then all you can get is a good
approximation of the relative value of the two hits (i.e., doing A
gives X times as much positive faction as doing B gives negative).

There are various cases where people have done this, e.g. for some
of the things that affect Dizok (Chardok) faction, but this sort of
information does seem to be quite rare.

I think I've read that the faction hits are listed in decreasing
order, i.e., biggest change first.  But even if that's true, it
doesn't help a lot.

I remember early on in my career, trying to faction up in lots of
places as an iksar, I submitted /feedback suggesting that the faction
messages could perhaps give a hint as to the degree of change, e.g.,

Your faction standing with X got slightly better. => 1-2 points
Your faction standing with X got better. => 3-7 points
Your faction standing with X got much better. => 8-20 points
Your faction standing with X got a great deal better. => 21 or more points

(I have no idea what the ranges should be, but you get the idea.)
Anyway, obviously, the suggestion has not been picked up. :(
