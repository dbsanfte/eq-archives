Why not?  Magicians don't solo by testing out the MR of mobs.  Magicians
solo with melee power and damage shields.  I'd take a whole lot of
malachite, cause you'll be doing 1 mob per pet though.  Magicians were one
of the few classes that didn't take a huge hit in The Grey.

Then again, lots of adds and "surprise!" mobs, neither of which is great for
a soloing magician.
