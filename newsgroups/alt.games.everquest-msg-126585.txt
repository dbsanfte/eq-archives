Not at all, Brusco's is very inefficient.  If you're going to kite for
EXP, it has to be the chant series.  You really don't become a kiting
machine until 46.  Brusco's is nice if you have an hour and you want
to kill a named, but I prefer to just charm mobs and send them at the
named until he's dead.
I still charm almost every time I play.  Started out as a bard/rogue
in seb today, grew to bard/rogue/rogue, then bard/rogue/rogue/cleric,
which all left me as tank/cc/slower.  Charm, attack, sic pet, twist,
back off, recharm, repeat.  It's amazing how fast the exp can flow
when you're killing non-stop and keeping the cleric above 80m.
The fun thing about charm is that it just seems so overpowering done
right.  There is something knowing that you can kill almost any mob
within 5 levels of you in an outdoor zone.  Charm-fighting solo in
Chardok is still a bit dicey.  :)
