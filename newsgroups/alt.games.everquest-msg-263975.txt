Hun, bazaar is the crappiest place you can try to get a rez, most 
of thepeople there are traderbots. The best place to get a rez is 
PoK. People there are hooking up with buffs, groups, 
tradeskilling and otherwise mumbling around and may rez for profit.

I know everybody I know hangs out on PoK between activities.
