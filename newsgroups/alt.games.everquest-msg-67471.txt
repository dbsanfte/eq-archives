 AoF is fun. I remember when I first fought him. It was a pretty
exciting experience.

 It's been awhile but I remember him having fairly high MR. However, if
you tash him you may be able to land a slow on him (Assuming you have
that at that level).

 Other thing, pull the lizards around him, first. I don't think AoF will
aggro and you can get him all alone. Once you have his room clear I'd
suggest clearing some of the mobs in the sewers. AoF has an annoying
quirk of running on you fairly early and it's easy to get 3-4 rooms of
adds before you take him down. The druid may possibly be able to land a
snare but I always had a problem with it.

 As for the actual pull, I don't know if I'd bother runeing. Just have
the cleric cast a Heal over Time spell on the tank just before aggro.
That should pretty much negate the Harm Touch. Like his true self up in
Fear, he's mostly a melee fight. 

 Also, if you want you could create an Iksar if you think you could get
him there safely. It may help in CR since they are not kos there.
However, that's just to the lizards. The gators and apes will still try
eating you.
