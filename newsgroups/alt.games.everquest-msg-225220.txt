Interesting considering the the influx of melee weapons that were
considered godlly only a year ago now being common place. Melees are
already doing more damage than casters in many cases outside of raids.
In fact thats what many of us thought the new weapons were, to bring
melee damage up to par with casters. Now this too? DPS aint the
problem with warriors it is and has always been agro control, Monks
problems stem from that AC nerf last year, and Rouges need a decent
frontal attack. But this?

Something aint right when twinked melees out damage wizards and this
happens enough to be noticable. Not sure what they are thinking of
here, more buttons to push or higher DPS?
