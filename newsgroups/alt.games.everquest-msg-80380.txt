I believe the poster was trying to say something along these lines, which I
too share just a bit:

I find it interesting that whenever something is nerfed in a negative way
retroactively, they can do it with ease and without any interaction (which
can be a pain in the ass) from the user.  However, when something is changed
for the better (according to them and sometimes us) we have to /petition,
wait forever too long to get a response, etc, etc...  I dont think I have to
spell it out anymore.
