Although a bit ranty, this is my attitude in general; I don't need an 
optimal group all the time (its nice sometimes), and I'm not an optimal 
group member for that matter, as I'm wearing a combination of newbie 
quest and ultra cheap bazaar junk (the under 25pp a slot kind of thing).

Could I have educated every player there on how to better play his 
class?  I'm egotistical enough to say yes.  Would I have been dead wrong 
at least 1/6th the time?  I'm honest enough to say yes to that as well.

I -was- engaged in a training mission, I was helping a new enchanter 
(previous character a 40 beastlord) learn how when and what to mez, and 
trying to teach the 30+ characters who grouped with us over the ten hour 
shift about not breaking mezzes.  At a certain point, I don't want to 
clutter their minds up with too much new information at once, if they 
walked away from the camp saying "hmmm, fighting one mob at a time sure 
is easier than fighting 6 at a time, and yet pulling 6 at a time is sure 
a lot faster than pulling one at a time.  Guess this Don't Break Mez 
thing really can work" then I'm happy.

I also find that having already "won" the game by my definition 
(leveling to 65... I know its a simple definition, but it seems to be 
one I'm honestly happy with) a couple times, that I'm amused by being 
untwinked and in clumsy but workable groups, trying to figure out how to 
get things done.  I'm sure I'd also like being in a group of experienced 
  speed leveling fiends outfitted in pure twink gear... but at the 
moment, I'm happy enough with my descision to make my berserk on a 
server I have no other characters on, removing the temptation to twink 
out like mad.
