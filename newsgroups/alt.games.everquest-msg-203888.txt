In the case of a chromo, it would go like this.

Click your Jboots
Close to max casting range
Cast Bonds of Force
Get debuffed, since mobs cast instantly and so long as the mob was in range
when it starts casting, you can be on the other side of the zone and the
spell will hit.
Reclick your Jboots while running away
Resnare mob that has dispelled itself
Get Boiling Blood cast on you (see above for running out of range)
Start your first nuke - use cold-based, virtually anything in this zone is
almost entirely fire resistant
Get debuffed while nuke lands
Click Jboots while running out of range
Attempt to resnare while chromo re-Boiling Bloods you
etc.

If I were to do this with the toon you describe, I would alter as follows:
Click Jboots
Ensure Fire Resist and Magic Resist were maxed (Boiling Blood is fire based,
iirc)
Close to maximum range, preferably with an extended-range item such as
Supple Scale Armband or Drachnid Thyxl
Fire cold-based nuke
Run away while spell gem refreshes, clicking Jboots back on
Fire cold-based nuke
Repeat until one of us is dead

Since Chromos do not move at SoW speed but do dispell themselves, high-speed
kiting is a better option.  Talk to your local alchemist, a bottle of Lesser
Regeneration will keep the DoT from killing you assuming the chromo dies
with you at 20 pct health or more.
