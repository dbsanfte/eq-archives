It really all depends on a) the bard, and b) whether grouped or solo...

For example, when soloing normal mobs, I tend to use weapons, and twist
certain songs (like Bellows, etc...)

When kiting a mob that isn't ungodly fast, I tend to keep a horn in my
inventory, and twist Selo's and Denon's Discord...  (I usually do this for
Griffawns, etc...)

Now, when I'm grouped, I put the weapons away and go full instrumental...
Usually twisting Anthem de Arms, whatever Rythm's are appropriate for the
mob, and Denon's Discord...  (just pray that the warriors in the group taunt
the mobs off me... :) )

Just remember, Bards are aggro magnets... especially if using Denon's or the
healing song in combat... (At 21st, I heal 9 per tick, times 6 people,
that's 54hp per tick = a -lot- of ticked off mobs.  :) )
