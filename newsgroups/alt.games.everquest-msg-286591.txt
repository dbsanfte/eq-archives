	Having someone click through a few paths in the UI is NOT
testing, much less QA. First of all, they changed the AA system, right?
So they should test to make sure that the AA system works.  What are you 
testing - and I glorify it by the use of the word - when you click through 
a few spots and see if things look like they're displayed correctly?

	The UI.  Not the AA system.  Testing the AA system would require
something like, oh, I dunno, *instrumenting* *the* *code* to output the 
results of AA calculations.  Then calling the routines outside of the 
actual game to verify them.

	That's not testing.  Charitably, I might go so far as classifying that
as user acceptance.  QA is not some half-assed we-clicked-it-and-it-looked
OK nonsense.  It's a scientific approach to software verification that's
aimed at reducing or even elimininating defects that make it into the 
released product.  I'm not sure why people who claim to be familiar with
the software development process seem to have such a problem with this.

	That's why you automate the process.  Supply known input and 
examine the output for correctness.  You don't hire your teenaged cousin
to run a few characters around and make sure the client doesn't crash.

	Oh, bwahaha, /snort, stop it, you're killing me, bwahaha...

	Great Ghu, did you *really* just say that there's no point to 
testing software because your users will find the bugs???  Donald
Knuth is turning over in his grave...  I'm glad the people who write
ATM software don't feel that way.  Even LINUX people test their code,
and not by booting a 486 and declaring victory if they get a console prompt.
