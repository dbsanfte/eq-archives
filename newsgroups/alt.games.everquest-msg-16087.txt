I killed Krak Windchaser a year or so back - I had to, someone accidentally
AE'd the aviak birdhouse and we annoyed him (luckily, it was peak time and
nothing downstairs was affected). Conned red at 25, and we had a heckuva
time dropping him, but we did, for fun. It's quite disappointing to get no
xp and no loot for a red kill, but we worked out why and chalked it down to
experience (and smacked the wizard). The corpse remained long enough for me
to get the full effect of the disappointment when I got the loot window up.
Bah.
