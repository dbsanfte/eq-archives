I developed a severely self destructive streak over the weekend and decided
to go over to the dark side and join the great and powerful Di'zok brood in
asserting the superiority of the Sarnak race over us lesser beings.

That said, I've been in Droga (and the currently broken all-goblin Nurga) a
lot, let 2 shrouds of nature rot (warder can spawn anywhere in Nurga, and
the old spot in Droga), got a RukGus sticker (whee gimp lewt), and nearly
died, um, 53 million times.  The new caster changes make greenie caster
goblins FUCKING SUCK.

There's new smithing recipes with the Deathsteel ore, that are nice for
people who are doing the faction work there anyways, only downside is that
the tempers for it take the mt. death mineral salts that are good for one of
the faction quests in Chardok.

Goblin tempers are one Grinning Goblin Brew (random drop in Droga/Nurga,
counts as booze) and one Mt. Death Mineral Salt (also random drop) in a brew
barrel, trivial to me at 122 brewing (gogogo fetid essence).  Sheet of
Deathsteel is TWO 15 wt blocks of Deathsteel ore (also random drop in
Droga/Nurga), and a goblin temper, not trivial to me at... 33 smithing, but
3/4 success rate.  Weapons are sheet of Deathsteel, weapon mold, and goblin
temper, haven't tried any yet, but trivials are reported in the 150-170
range, which is nice for us goblin slaugterers who need smithing
post-revamp.

At least the cash on the goblins is decent, I just wish that the caster
types weren't so fucking obnoxious, a green necro goblin (that never summons
a pet for some reason) can chain cast his poison nuke and take about 1khp
off me in the time it takes me to cast 3 scoriae on him, which sucks, since
not only do I have to meditate the 750 mana from nuking his ass, but the
100-300 mana spent on a regen spell (usually use Chloroplast, but in a close
fight I'll splurge on Regrowth)  It also sometimes takes more nukes because
one of the shaman/cleric goblin types will heal their buddy, which really
blows ass.

It probably doesn't help that I hunted a bunch in Chardok prior to seeing
the light, as well as some sarnak hunting in LoIO in my younger days, but at
least I never made max kos to either Brood of Dizok or Sarnak Collective.
(would be nice though if I could turn in enough gobby skin and mineral salts
to get non kos with collective, which is all the sarnak outside of Chardok
and in other zones, inside Chardok they're on Brood of Dizok, which is the
only one that goes up from killing gobbies)

Hrm.  I guess there's no real point to this post, but I'll probably get some
help doing faction by dragging one of my melee friends along to camp an Idol
of the Thorned at some point.

Congratulations me on being fucking insane.
