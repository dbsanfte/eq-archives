One player you said understood. No damage done to reputation. The
other player, if he didn't get it, he's an obvious moron and your
reputation with him/her doesn't matter. If they don't know enough
about EQ to understand charm and won't bother listening when you try
to explain it, then why does their opinion of you matter? Don't blame
SOE for people being morons.

Fuck, if you were playing on a blue server, then the first guy was a
moron, too, for not being able to figure out that you were charmed
when you were attacking him (As if the fucking "LD" over the head
wasn't a dead give-away to anyone who knows jack shit about the game).
