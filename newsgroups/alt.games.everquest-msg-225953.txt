Plain and simple answer in this case is that you can't.  At this point you
are at that "sticky" point for rangers where most of us ventured into the
boring world of solo the animals.   Personally I got sick and tired of
hearing people whine because I played my character the way it was meant to
be played.  At your level you should be duel wielding and in many cases will
pull aggro from similarly outfitted tank types. You did exactly what you can
in that situation stop attacking for a few seconds let the tank get aggro
back; rinse repeat as needed.  Dont think this was the answer you wanted but
this exact situation is why I fear kited from about lvl 35 thru 50 because I
got sick of hearing complaints from tank types.  And yes my ranger is my
first and only character leveled the old fashioned way to level 65 with 265
AA points.
