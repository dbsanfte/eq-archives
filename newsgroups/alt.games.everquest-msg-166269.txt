Well you appear to be right, but I just want to mention *I* have died
quite a large number of times in a single raid fight from time to
time, including prekunark in our first abortive attempts to kill
Nagafen for the first time on the server. :-)

Just never three times in a minute. It took me about 90 seconds to die
three times. :-)
