Wish there were more druids like you to port us xp rezzers... I don't accept
cash for my rezzes... and just 2 days a go I rezzed a piece of #$@
Wychwethyl (Zebuxoruk) in CS and then not a half hour later asked him for a
port to WC and he said he would do it for 50pp.... /grrrr. Careful of this
one too, I have seen him selling Vendor Jewels as SoV Quest Gems to the
uninitiated.  Also somewhat well known for his spam in /shout and /ooc.

Oh well.. I pay 20pp for a port, no more no less, and if someone says they
want more... I refuse to take the port... and I NEVER pay before I am ported
unless I know and trust the porter.
