I guess most people simply have no idea of what electrum is (an alloy of 
gold and silver) and where it would fit on a monetary value scale. Makes 
sense to take it out.

Well, any new system would have to pit itself *against* the expectations 
of the most likely players, nerds like us who grew up playing D&D. I 
think that sticking somewhat closely to the D&D template is one of the 
main ingredients of EQ's success... although I'm glad they weren't 
afraid of making necessary changes, like dropping the imbecilic 
"memorize multiple copies of a spell" magic system.
