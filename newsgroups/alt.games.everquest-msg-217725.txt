Best LDoN group I was in to-date completed 4 missions in a little over 3 hours. Yes, we did
Assassinate missions, collections, rescue and slaughters in about 30 minutes per. The group
consisted of a Bard (puller), Cleric, Paladin (MT), Shammy and 2 Wizzies (I was one of the
wizards).
 
 Most of the time us 2 Wizards (both high AA counts and FT15+) destroyed the pulled target
even before the Shamen had a chance to debuff or slow it. As soon as we completed the
mission we gated back and selected a new mission and gated back to start again. 
 
 We were kicking some serious ass that day. I was loving it.
