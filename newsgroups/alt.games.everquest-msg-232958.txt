When a Windows driver gets hung you sometimes need to remove the
hardware, reboot and delete the driver, reinstall the hardware and
then reinstall the driver before it reinstalls correctly. Try that
before buying a new network card, but then again network cards are
cheap. If you do buy a new one get a different model card if it is
from the same manufacturer. Not sure if XP home has the problem with
reinstalling a driver to replace a failed or corrupted driver but
previous versions of Windows have.
