I have never know for sure which is better. I have two items for head gear,
one has the stats AC4 Wis+4 mana+4. The other one has AC5 str+3 mana +25.
Wisdom is at 170 right now.
I cast a spell with know mana usage till mana was all gone and with both I
got the same number of spells. Decided to go with the mana+25 because could
use higher ac and str.
I guess what I'm asking is just how much mana does 1 point of wisdom give
and 1 point of + mana give. Is there a place to get this kind of info.
Thanks,
Shirley
