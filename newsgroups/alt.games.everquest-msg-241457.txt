I just had another question regarding FV and things not being no-drop:
Does FV have the "trivial loot" code?  I thought I read something
about FV players who needed items for their newbie armor quests but
the items wouldn't drop because the mobs were green to them so they
would have to buy the items from lower level players who still got
experience from the mobs (or maybe they could buy from vendors too).
