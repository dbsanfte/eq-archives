I normally connect with my DSL and have an ATI Radeon 32mb PCI Video card.
My DSL has been pooched for a while and they tell it will be ready sometime
Friday Dec. 7. I have to connect with dial up until then. The problem I am
having is, with dial up, and my modem is also PCI, is I have to remove my
video card in order to connect to EQ or else I get dumped at the server
select screen or sooner and my modem tries to reconnect.

Short of purchasing an external modem, does anyone know a way that I can use
both my PCI modem and my PCI video card together?

Thanks,

Rick
