A true roleplaying game can be many things. But the point was more
limited than that - a mmorpg does not have to be all about gear and
gaining levels. That is a narrow, shortsighted view.

Not at all. People went to both SolB and LG. They were moderately
close to equivalent. It's only when they are not close to equivalent
(say, Ssra vs PoV, or Trak Teeth vs DL) that you run into trouble.
It's not as hard as you think.

That is your opinion, not a debunking, and ignores the other
solutions.

The example is mine. You turned it into a balance question. I pointed
out the absurdity of mentioning balance as it pertains to my example.

Your desire to eliminate all forms of interactivity with other people
doing the fell ghoul is exactly what I want to avoid. I'd rather have
the Fell ghoul available to be zerged if that's what the players want
to do. Triggered quest spawning solves the other problems as it does
for most named bosses.

A long time ago on Tholuxe as it was brand new my guild raided the
Ghoul Lord at L30s/20s. And won. Damn straight it was a zergfest but
boy was it fun. And one of our warriors had the first yak on the
server. I guess you don't like people doing that?

And I say if 200 people can take out Rallos Zek and win without the
zone crashing, who are you to say its wrong? That is elitist behavior
at its worst.

Do you know what instancing is like in WoW? It's the ultimate in
camping/farming. You do an instance over and over until the purple
item you are after finally drops and you win the roll. There is no
merging there. There is no world effect. Because of the instancing
there is no interactivity for the players once they're in and for
quite a while WoW was turning into exactly what I described - a
graphical chatroom for people waiting to form up their pocket
dimension instance groups. WoW got rescued from that dreck because of
quests in enemy territory, battlegrounds, and PvP.

Instancing as implemented in WoW is probably its single worst element.
Popular only with the powergrinders (casual or not).

UO *still* has at least 150k subscribers even with its problems. And
that does not include private shards. The numbers do not support your
hypothesis, especially since early EQ was more worldy than it is
today. Today's EQ, if you ignore its technical advances, would
probably never have grown like it did back then, or if it did, it
wouldn't have kept the players.

But even ignoring that, the fact UO is still going strong and even
still releasing expansions shows that a world *can* be entertaining,
even when done as wrong as UO. Imagine what one done *right* would be
like.
