Actually, this was intended to help some melee types solo.
Casters can solo much longer than than melee because they can root and dot,
while melee can't hurt anything without getting hurt in return.

The bind wound to 70% is disgusting, though.  (After hours of deliberatly
hurting myself and then binding wounds, I finally reach 201 and get to bind
to 70%; then they give it to everyone.)
