At some level the whole game does work like that.   Fight a level 3
melee spider in a newbie garden.  Fight a level 30 melee spider in
some other zone.   Fight a level 63 melee spider in yet another zone.
What's the difference?   Art, right?

What's the point now?   You get to see new mob models and zone
graphics.  Other than that, it's largely the same - right?   And, for
quite a bit of the mobs, it's just coloring on the same ol' mob anyway.

It's possible to level from 20 to 50 in Splitpaw.  I'm not sure anyone
would actually do that -- it's horribly inefficient -- but it's possible.
So what?  Personally I'd rather have the people who want to face
solo content without the danger of group adds or having to get
around group mobs "locked away" in a solo instance anyway...

Anyway, look at the reality of the situation:  it's an adventure pack, a
minimal purchase.  Because it scales, they don't need to worry about
limiting their potential sales.   Everyone between level 20 and level 50
can buy it and enjoy the content, all at a fixed cost in their development
budget.   The only difference is the level 20 fury-type mob for a level
20 becomes a level 50 fury-type mob for a level 50.   Instead of a
rare T3 drop it's a rare T5 drop, or T5 armor instead of T3 armor.
Except for the art that goes with it, that's pretty much the only
difference between fighting a gnoll camp in TS at 20 and a lizardman
camp in Feerott at 35 anyway.

IMO it's a rather elegant solution for what is a minor piece of the
game -- I hope they do all the *adventure packs* that way.
