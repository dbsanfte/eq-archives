Actually this one can be quite effective, what if someone ties an alligator
to a fire hydrant and there's a fire at the building next to it?  The fire
fighters try to hook up the hose to the hydrant, oh no, there's an
alligator, he will eat me if I try hooking this thing up! Oh well, I guess
that building is just going to have to burn. Pity. ;-)
