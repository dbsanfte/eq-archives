Ok, I ca tell you for a fact that the bottom dropped out of the porting
market. Sure, ej, cobalt scar, WL still get offers; but otherwise it's
nowhere near what it used to be like, especially as one of the biggest
sources of income was ye olde nexus port, so people could get to the bazaar.

Warriors max skills were increased in certain areas and they were given the
meat shield discipline as well. No, I don't see warriors soloing, but i do
sometimes see rogues soloing. Warriors aren't expected to solo, but monks
were, hence the foraging etc etc for iksar monks. They were supposed to be
self sufficient to a degree, and penalised in that their ability to loot (ie
carry stuff) was crippled. With weight reducing bags, that's not so much of
an issue now, but give a monk and a warrior the same amount of cash, and the
warrior will have better ac, hp, clicky things, resists, and now with the
windblade, more damage.

The guy who ran "monkly business" is quitting because of it, and the guy who
runs mobhunter is clearly ambivalent. I reacted by soloing my druid more, as
he actually does better that way, despite the fact that my monks equipment
is in the top rankings of dropable gear according to the monkly business
site.

In jaggedpine where they were grouped, my druid went link dead while
fighting a griffon that was dk blue. The fight immediately went badly, and i
had to feign death to survive, despite full buffs up, mend, and my
stonestance. To me, that's the sign of a crippled melee class, and if that
happened to a warrior, i'd be astonished, especially as i frequently watch
warriors (and even paladins) chew through the same mobs... last night a 52
warrior was soloing poachers that are dk and lt blue, and my monk can do a
light blue, but solo, against a dk blue, he's useless. If i wasn't
two-boxing, i would have retired the character.

I'm not quite sure i understand why only casters are allowed to solo? Some
classes, like warrior and cleric, are clearly designed as groupers, but
bards, necros, mages, druids, wizards and rangers solo all the time,
although they seem to be crushed into groups at higher level.

I'm playing with the retirement anyway, as my friends have left now, and I
get the feeling that sony doesn't like solo players. Must make more work for
them somehow. And no, you can't have my stuff.
