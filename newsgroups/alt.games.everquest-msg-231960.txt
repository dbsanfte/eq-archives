What's the date of that EQLive quote?  That doesn't really sound like
PoK at all.  I haven't been to Katta or some of the others, but
"Priests, Shadowknights, Paladins" and any who have been forsaken
sounds a whole lot different.  

Maybe the lead city in the new expansion? Or will it be a download
zone off of one of the "caves to nowhere" that are in the game?
