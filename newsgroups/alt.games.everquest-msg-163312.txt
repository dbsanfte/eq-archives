Well I just got Shroud of the Dar Brood so selling the Cloak of Truth anyway,
I'll have to hope the meditate is as useless to me as everyone thinks it is.

220 hp every 12 seconds against PoP mobs?  Oooooooooooh.  I think I'd be more
likely to tank em myself.

On the other hand, you have an excellent point, for any young cleric out there
(45 plus) who can afford a pair of these and a  cheap horse its going to be hard
to beat this particular item for your next 10 levels or so for exp grind heals.
Maybe you can build a robot to click the things every 12 seconds cause that part
gets old after a while.

Really nice.  Also really expensive, 15Kpp plus on MT.  I'm not sure thats the
single item I'd like to blow my life's savings on, since it has no clicky or
focus.

Sounds like a good project when I'm bored... maybe tonight

Well, I can say "insignificant amount of mana" does that help?

Sounds like a lot more useful expenditure of cash.

I avoided a horse because of problems I've heard reported with them, but
principly because most interesting fights seemed to take place indoors anyway.
With the addition of POP, though, I'm outdoors a LOT, and sit aggro is a lot
bigger deal than it used to be.

What happens when you melee on a horse?  Kills the med bonus to have attack
button on?  What about Yaulp V, how is that affected?
