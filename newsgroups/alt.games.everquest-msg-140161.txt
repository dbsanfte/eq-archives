Do a search on "Young Man Mulligan" and you can probably find it on
the web somewhere.  Has over 60 verses as I recall.  Since it was
started a long time ago (in the 60s?), a lot of the references are to
science fiction "classics" written before then.  I believe it has
since accumulated some verses relating to newer works.

Note - the original song above is often coupled to another bragging
song,  i.e. "10,000 Years Ago" coupled to  "The Biggest Thing That Man
Has Ever Done."  These are different tunes and are alternately sung by
two people in a "I can top that" mode.   So after the above verse
regarding the Garden of Eden from one person would come another verse
regarding the Garden of Eden  ("...joined the Apple Pickers Union and
I always paid my dues," etc.) in rebuttal.  The Science Fiction
version uses both tunes but not specifially in a rebuttal pattern -
generally just more original claims.
