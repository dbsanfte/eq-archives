Much appreciated.  I was seriously considering going to Barnes & Noble and
buying the strat guide just for the maps.

Man ... can I pick 'em, or can I pick 'em?  All the places to have a first
character, and I pick the one that seems to be the most like a maze. <g>

Another newbie question ... which lift is considered the newbie lift?  I
usually use the one with the Priest of Discord.  I'd seen a message about
someone sharpening rusted blades for free at the newbie lift, but when I
asked which lift it was the PC came to me instead.  That was great, and I
appreciated the free weapon work, but I still don't know which lift is the
newbie lift.

TIA!
