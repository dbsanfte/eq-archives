What a great post. I couldn't agree more. I've come back to my old home 
recently where I am fortunate to have a couple of like-minded friends to 
play with. We help each do things and have fun doing so. The community in EQ 
like any has its ups and downs but sadly the focus on itemization and toning 
down difficulty and interdependence has hurt EQ compared to what it once 
was.

I played WoW for a short time recently and leveled a character to 70 and was 
amazed at the extremes of this I saw there. The game can be fun at times but 
it quickly devolves into meaningless solo grinds for gear and rep and rep 
and gear and honor and gear and gear and gear, etc. One can solo to maximum 
level and then outfit oneself in so-called "epic" gear (season 1 arena set 
from farmed BG honor?) without ever grouping at all really or making a 
single real friend in the world. And an awful lot of them don't. It amazes 
me that wow sells the best while being distilled down into the least this 
kind of game can be really. It's too bad you can't buy the WoW Single Player 
or perhaps Home edition that installs the world locally and allows solo play 
or even a party of 5 on a local home network. I find it hard to imagine the 
raid content is any more compelling than the rest of the game so no loss 
there really.
