Depends on how he plays it.  Most bards do swing swords and stuff at
that level, but I don't think they really tank.  Bards don't have the
HP of real tanks and generally learn to use low-taunt songs.  Bard
skills do cap about the same as real tanks, and our defensive caps at
252 along with warriors, but cap at 200 until 50, as you mentioned.  
I think I remember reading that defensive is one of the skills that
can be raise on green mobs.  If this is true, probably the best thing
to do is go to Butcherblock, bring a small train, and just keep
singing Hymn of Regeneration to keep healing.
