  Why, you think you have some special rights that no one else has?

  This isn't a free speech issue at all, it's their server and they
can tell you to shut up and you'll like it.  You no more have a right
to speak freely on someone else's forum than you do inside my house.

  You should consider yourself ahead of the game that you weren't
banned completely, but go ahead, call them up and piss them off some
more and you just might become the martyr that you want to be.
