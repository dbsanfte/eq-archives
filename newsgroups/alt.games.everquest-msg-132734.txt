As with other Rune type spells, any damage that is averted by
the Favor is considered not to have hit at all.  This can be
extremely helpful as it means you don't have to make a
channelling check trying to get that spell off.  So a good target
would be that overwhelmed chanter who is trying to get off an
AOE mez or Stun.  Unfortunately 150 points is pretty tiny
at these levels and generally Favor is therefore not all that
helpful in this regard
