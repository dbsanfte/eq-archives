Yes. Part of the SoL installation is revamped textures for all
previously-existing EQ zones, the old world, Kunark, and Velious. The
improvement in quality is startling - I often find myself thinking, "Hmm
haven't been here a while, looks different... Oh!" and realising I
haven't been to that zone since installing the new textures. Probably
the best part is the improved detail of 'ground' textures - the desert
of Ro is no longer a featureless yellow plane, the Commonlands actually
have grass(*), etc etc.

You can see examples of the change in textures here:

(*) note that the once-promised 'active flora' feature didn't make the
final cut.
