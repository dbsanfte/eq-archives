What I don't get is where you're getting that I'm hanging anything on
a "bad bit of semantics". I responded to the question. "What do you do
when you stop killing stuff in this hack-n-slashy game". I roleplay.
'til I feel like killing stuff again. Wasn't meant to be contrary or
anything. It was a simple statement. *shrug* How is that hanging
anything on semantics? If you can't handle that someone has something
they do in the game beyond mindless hack-n-slash, that's your problem,
not mine. It's more you looking for an excuse to flame me, trying to
start a fight. I'll remember that next time YOU accuse ME of trying to
pick fights for the sake of arguing.
