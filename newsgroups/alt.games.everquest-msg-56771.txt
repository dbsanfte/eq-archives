*boggle*

Were you born this dense, or did you have to train the skill? Comparing
120+ STA vs 75 STA is a fucking NO BRAINER.

Compare an Ogre SK vs an Ogre WAR with matching STA, then come back here
and tell us that the SK has more HPs. Yes, this epiphany you've had was
painfully obvious to those with more than two brain cells to rub together.
An Ogre SK with 130+ STA is going to have more HP than a Halfwit warrior
with 75.
