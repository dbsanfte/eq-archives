Stun + stun > Snare, and there seems to be a bit of bonus hate for
being first, so pull with stun and stun again asap and you already
have more hate than a successful slow.  If the stun was a DD+stun
you get even more hate there, even if DD is resisted (stun seems to
get same hate whether resisted or not, for that matter whether the
mob is stun immune or not).  Paladins get an assortment of stuns
with varying durations and cast times, and some have DD components.
And then of course, if you're in melee range you get to swing your
weapon besides (and Taunt too, for that matter).  It's been a long
time since Kaev had an "agro contest" with an SK, so I'm not sure
how the two knights compare nowadays, but between chain-stunning,
melee, procs, and the occasional group heal I never had trouble
gaining or holding agro when I was MT... when I made a mob mad at
me it stayed mad at me until one of us was dead.
