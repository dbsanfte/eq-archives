I doubt this will be much help, but at least its information. The problem
started to occur to me around 2 patches ago. Judging from the Chat room
traffic, the patch affected many others as well, but most responses were
"its your ISP". Well, I kept getting the error for 2 days. I then tried
another dial up access number and the problem went away. I went back to the
original number and the 1017 error came back.

As far as ANY other internet function is concerned (including EQ chat), the
two dial up access numbers operated identically, same baud, etc. One can get
to EQ, the other can't???? It seems as though EQ is somehow sensitive to the
actual hardware the UDP packets are routed through, and this was introduced
in the patch which tried to fix zone crashes.

A new eqmain.dll just got patched in, that may address this problem. Many
people are having this problem, visit the chat rooms and you will see many
cries for help. Using WINIPCFG to change you IP address may help, or
changing ISP routing by using a different access number or method (switch
from modem to DSL, or back), etc may help. Sorry for the vague answer and
pull and pray solution, but it worked for me ...
