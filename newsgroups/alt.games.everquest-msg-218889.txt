Sometimes its EBay.  Sometimes its PLing or heavy twinking, but
honestly I think the latter tend to at least have -some- clue, to
twink yourself you first have to level up a character in some
other class, which means you've seen all the classes at work at
least on occaision... or you did nothing but solo, or you bought
your cash to buy the gear on ebay, which isn't much of a step up
from just buying the character himself on ebay.

Being clueless at 25 (when paladul starts to suck) is pretty much
to be expected these days.  Being clueless at 50, though,
requires that you actively sought out ways to avoid learning
anything about how to play the game.

Not that that doesn't seem to happen.  I can't tell you how many
shaman I've had to sit down and have the Cannidance chat with. 
See, the bees go from flower to flower and...  Oh wait, thats a
different talk.
