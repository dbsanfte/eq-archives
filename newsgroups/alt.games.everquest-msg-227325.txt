Wow, you are the first person I've ever seen say they took more than the
"necessary to get past this" 6 AA out of the first tier.  I wouldn't
pick either regen 3 or metabolism 3 if I didn't have to take 3 more of
something to get to 6 (I'll grant you, I'd take the run 3 before pretty
much every AA out there)

Its an interesting thought, though, as you say, later on, 3 aa just
aren't a whole lot, and going back and picking up metabolism might be
worth while when you start to run low on "real" aa that are a
significant upgrade at 3 points.

Splendid
