It seems to me that a lot of tradeskillers want their trades to be "worth" 
more.  IE, profitable for the time and huge amounts of plat they have 
invested in it.

We've seen some tradeskill changes with Luclin, some of which were nice.  I 
don't know how much more profitable it makes them, though.

What -I- would like to see are more non-monetary rewards for tradskilling - 
things that you can get from a successful combine that are beneficial to a 
player, and are NO-DROP.

One place they could have implemented this would be the Rallic Pack.  
Making the final combine trivial something along the lines of 120-130 and 
making the Rallic Pack LORE NO-DROP would give tailors something nice for 
their efforts.  Granted, no one is going to crank up tailoring, the 
MotherBitch of tradeskills, just to get a Trivial at 125 Rallic pack, but, 
it would be a nice "reward" if you have been through the hell of collecting 
all the crap to get your tailoring to there, anyway.

I love the idea of the Ring and Shawl quests, and wish there were more 
things like that in the game.  -Are- there more things that ( non-
monetarily ) reward a tradeskiller like these quests?

On another note, has anyone tried the following...

Most of us know the RNGenerator in EQ just plain blows.  I'm almost of the 
opinion that it's just a SIN wave or something of that sort ( that's how I 
picture it in my head ).  When tradeskilling, you will get -definite- 
streaks of skillups, there is no disputing this.  So, if you have some 
major skill-up that you want, say, in jewelry ( insert chorus of "in 
jewelry" ), have you ever kept some other tradeskill parts around to "find 
the groove" with?

IE.  You really want skillups in Jewelcraft.  So, you put that 2k worth of 
crap in your jeweler's bag and put it to the side.  Now, you work on your 
low-level fletching.  Suddenly, you get a skill-up!  Quickly drop the 
arrows where you normally do, close one bag, and open that Jewelry bag and 
hit [ combine ].  If you are a Vet Tradskiller, this can be a VERY fast 
sequence where the "Sweet spot" of the RNG won't have passed.

Anyone been that anal?  If so, what are the perceived results?  More 
skillups when you want them?
