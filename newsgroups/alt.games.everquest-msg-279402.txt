	And it will be as much a fiction as the last one. What would impress me 
is if you found a genuine magelo profile of a 10k unbuffed warrior who 
isn't wearing any raid gear.

	The complaint is that Sony brought out yet another expansion that had 3 
zones for everyone and the rest really for raiders. Hell, most 
non-raiders couldn't stay alive in Tipt or VXed long enough to find out 
who good the exp was, and until Omens there was no progression available 
to bridge that gap.

	Your complaints from two years ago? You mean the raid-whines that all 
got fixed? :P

	Aye the same people who leave single-group content after one wipe.

	I'm not referring to the hardest of the hardest core. Those people 
don't see me in this game, and I don't see them. OTOH I can find 
numerous examples of people with half MY played time, in gear vastly 
better than I've spent MY 100 days getting.

	And they're rare as hens' teeth yes? So looking for an joining one 
isn't exactly a progression path.

	I've accepted that rate of wipage in the past to obtain upgrades, but 
this is not the point. What I was suggesting is that your magelo would 
involve either such gaps or the kind of repitition or time investment 
that would have even the uber-hardcore-elite raiders slitting their wrists.

	You mean the 250k/slot tradeskill stuff right? :P
