Well, this seems like a good time to jump in with this weird
dream I had the other day =)

So, we were fighting in Nagafen's Lair. For some reason I (A cleric)
and the pally were following our SK puller around when he pulled. And
we spotted a Dark Elf female NPC with Orcale Robes on. When I saw her,
I became very nervous, but the SK told the group that he would pull
her. Time slowed to a crawl, and me and the pally shouted "NOOO"
simultaneously, and as the first hit landed on the NPC, she turned
into Lady Vox! Booom, the next thing I saw was "Loading, please wait."
And then I woke up.

So, in my dreams, Lady Vox lives in Naggy's lair, in DE form, with an
Oracle Robe on... When I woke up, I had to laugh at this.

Anyway, I heartily endorse this product and/or guild name!

Rune, who's sorry for hijacking your thread.
