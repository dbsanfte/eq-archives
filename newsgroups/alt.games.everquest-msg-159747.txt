}I know you've been around since the patch that added it. alt-click on

}so it stays up rather than holding right-click on it). Type your line.

I was trying to do this the other night.  The picture did not stay up when I 
alt-clicked.  Not with left-alt left-click, nor right-alt left-click, nor 
left-alt right-click, nor right-alt right-click.  But I -could- make a link 
by holding right-click and going up to the picture and left-clicking.  Has 
anyone else had this problem with alt-click?
