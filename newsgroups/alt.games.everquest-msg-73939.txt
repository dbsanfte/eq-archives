you think?  I'm speaking from exp.  I asked before I ever set up the
gambling game.  They said it was legit at the time i asked, and I ran the
game on bristlebane.  Whether this will change or has changed in the near
future I cannot say.  A portion of the game I ran has been and probably is
still being run by others.  I recently read from somewhere that copy catting
is the sincerest form of flattery.

EQ plat might have but isn't suppose to have real world value, because its
against the rules to trade it for real money.  Its suppose to be a game
where people are playing it for fun, not a game where people are selling off
their chars or plat for $$.  Unlike UO or AC which doesn't chastise players
for selling to others for real $$, EQ does.  Thus you saying that a
fictional char in a fictional world with fictional plat who cannot pretend
to gamble (because in real life there is no actual effect), doesn't make
sense.

In EQ if someone does cheat you, you can always go to the GM's to bring your
case before them.  Even with gambling.  If you intend to gamble and give
someone plat and they run off with it, you should definitely Bring it up
with the GM's.  Don't give someone more plat than is reasonable, especially
if you don't know them.

Unfortunately I had to take precautions when running the game, so had to
take all plat up front.  I also took items at a rough and low end cost of
what they were worth.  I'd have people who didn't even want the items gamble
them with the potential to make money off items  they didn't even want.

Because its been such a while since I was able to play my enchanter, I don't
know if the gambling situation is exactly the same.  I'd be mildly surprised
if it wasn't.  I remember several groups that we joked about doing gambling,
and it seemed silly.  Who would play a game where the odds were against you
and you would most likely lose money.  Surprisingly, its the potential to
make money people see, not the most likely outcome of losing the money they
are betting.

In further retrospect, isn't rolling for items a form of gambling, to divvy
up the treasure from grouping?  if you use that /rand fuction they put in
the game, and don't cheat anyone / stay honest at all times / checked with
them to make sure it was acceptable, how can you be banned?

Did I mention I saved screens where players said they had more fun playing
my gambling game than doing any other activity in EQ?  I think I had
different people say this at least 3 or 4 times.
