    I was grouped with a 15 year old necro a couple of weeks back.
You wanna talk about painful?  He kept referring to his pet as his
"boner".  The skeleton was very helpful and well behaved, and a
welcome member of the party, but it was getting very tedious to 
have to listen to all the "My boner will protect us" and "My boner
is getting beaten on!" comments.
   Ugh.
