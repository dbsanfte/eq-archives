  I asked for a price check on the Shiny Brass Idol, and got two responces
in two different zones from two different people of 10-20pp. Is this right?
Caster's Realm said 410pp, and some of you have said anywhere from 50pp to
150pp. Is this just the demand on my server, or if I sat around in EC for a
bit, would I get a buyer for a much higher price than 20pp?
