A week ago or so a systemwide message said something like "Befallen is now
back in the hands of the Dark Elves."

I've looked at that place with my then lvl 36 mage, a 35 paladin, a 35 druid
and a 32 monk. We got to the 3rd floor but got wiped there. The place is now
extremely overcrowded by mobs and if someone else dies you get that train as
well.
Everything was green to me, but our lvl 32 monk got some exp here and there.
We were killed on the 3rd and our corpse run simply existed of looting and
porting asap. The monk who feigned before she was killed just ran the mobs
around so we could loot.

The place is not nice and I would suggest 2 or 3 groups of mid 20's to work
together to tackle the zone now.
