Hi! Who uses a modified UI. I am a bit afraid so far. My general PC skills
are not so top notch to get involved in all sorts of coding and crap. I like
the UI but some of the stuff I've seen you can change does look awesome. So,
here are some questions I have:

1. Does it always default back to the "normal" UI or does it stay with the
one you put on after you log out then log back in? (as much as I hate change
my wife hates it more!)

2. Does it cause lag problems or any problems at all beyond the usual
nonsense?

3. Any suggestions on a basic one to try out that is still pretty cool?

Granted, question #3 is only revelant to me based on the answers to
questions 1 and 2.
