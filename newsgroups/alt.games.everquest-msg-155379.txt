As Jazz mentioned, "grouped" just means "more than one person."  My level 60
enchanter groups for experience really really close to 100% of the time.  If
I want to solo I play my 53 druid or any of my level 20s.

Though I never do really solo...with 3 accounts and 3 computers even if I'm
"soloing" (not grouped) he gets babysat with at least one other of my
characters. :)  I've paid my dues...downtime sucks. <g>
