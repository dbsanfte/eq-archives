Yep - and it is handy as all hell.  Get into Tim Deep and head to
neg12260, 4360 (spires) and then swim straight down. 

I often will head over there with a Shaman buddy.  We get on the boat
in FV, zone out and jump off shortly after.  While in the water, he
sows us (if necessary), then casts lev.  We run up the outside of the
boat to get higher up and then 'water walk' all the way to the
firepots room.  Swim down, grab the right pot and *bang* you're in:

Grobb
Oggok
Erudin
Neriak Commons
Greater Faydark
North Felwithe
Halas 
East Freeport
Cabilis West
South Kaladim
Akanon
Rivervale

Just hit the right pot  (I have a map).

Tres cool.
