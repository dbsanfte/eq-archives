I'm afraid I gotta agree with all the above replies.
Although I wouldn't go so far as to say all those that play get what they
deserve, that just sounds like it is your right to scam gullible people, I

The /ignore list is now extended to 100 just use it.

Also if you can't afford to lose the money you shouldn't gamble it.
