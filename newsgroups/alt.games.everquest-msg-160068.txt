He's not.

Nope, *all* priest HP buffs are accompanied by an immediate heal
for the same value of HPs.  There's nothing special (that way)
about cleric buffs.  Druids have a poor HP/mana ratio on their
skin line, however, when compared to clerics.  And that's why a
cleric can use an HP/AC buff as a heal while a druid won't.
(Druids are usually less than 1 HP/mana while clerics are closer
to 2 HP/mana.)
