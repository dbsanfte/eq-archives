Because I live in Australia and play outside US times I rarely, except
for server crashes, see GM's or guides online.

I have to resort to using the online sony tool to get to my server GM.
I would have to say that I have only been responded to 50% of the time
through this means as well.

The customer service has certainly gone downhill from the old days.
