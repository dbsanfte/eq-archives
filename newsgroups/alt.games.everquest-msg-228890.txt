Lately on my regular server (Innorrukk) I've had a hard time finding groups.  
So I decided to check out a PvP server.  I chose Rallos Zek I think is the 
name.  It's the only PvP server without teams/dietys.  Or maybe it was Sullon 
Zek?  I don't really remember right now.  Currently I've got a Dark Elf 
ShadowKnight and got him to lvl 3.  So far I've seen a few other newbies 
running around but haven't seen any pvp battles.  I heard once that you can't 
attack anyone under lvl 4, so when I reach lvl 4 am I going to be attacked all 
the time?  Are groups difficult to find or are there others that will group 
because they want to level up and not just kill each other?  Are there any 
guilds that would take in a newbie PvP player?  Any other info I should be 
aware of?
