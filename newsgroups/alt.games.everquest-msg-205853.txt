You seem to have mistaken tourism for dungeon crawling.

The graveyards in PoP are stupid, a pathetic easy-mode sop tossed
to whiny twits whose game play most closely resembles a robot
masturbating.  You want an easy dungeon crawl?  go play NWN and
respawn in place a until you finally kill that dragon, I'm sure
there'll be much cheering and backslapping over your 133t skillz.
