    Has your DPS changed? Has your method of delivering that DPS changed?
Here's the two things I can think of when I read this:

(1) You're doing less DPS, so it takes more time to kill stuff. That would
put the sort of strain on Rakyn that you're describing, where he's not
worried about losing you quickly (you taking more damage) but rather he's
using a lot of mana keeping you alive. You've also lost his nukes, which
means even more damage taken in a fight.
(2) You've switched from a two hander to dual wield. While riposte damage
isn't too big on XP mobs, it might be enough for a shaman to notice the
difference in damage taken.

    I honestly haven't heard of a tanking problem from my chain-wearing
friends, and one of them is usually the MT for our LDoN adventures (rogue).
Have you checked class boards to see if others have had that problem?

    James
