C'mon Dan, not even in the same galaxy as posting someones full name,
address, city, state, and zip in a public forum.  I don't care if you can
look at someone's header.  You'll just never convince me that's appropriate
behavior.  There, I said it...no cussing just the way I see it.  You say the
info is there and I don't disagree.  I say that following up the discovery
of that info by posting it publicly - and even going so far as to
extrapolate an address, ISP, RL name out of it is NOT right.  It's not
remotely cool or impressive.

Fine, you think anyone skilled enough to double click their OE icon is also
inherently able to extrapolate personal info out of message headers - I say
BS.

erm....ugh - must have touched a nerve...I'm thinking why even respond to

I think when you get YOUR panties out of a wad, you'll think better of it.
You've always seemed reasonable to me, not sure why you're coming off like
this now.  But hey, whatever floats your boat chief.
