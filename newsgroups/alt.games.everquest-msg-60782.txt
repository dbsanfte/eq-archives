Okay, I understand that if somebody dies and they are looking for a
cleric rez, there is a three hour time limit the player has to get the
rez; after that, they no longer are eligible to get one.  Does this
mean three hours on-line time only or just plain three hours, period,
even if you log off for more than three hours?

(for instance, you die and you can't find a cleric around to rez you
so you log off, then log back on four hours later hoping to find a
cleric then.  Are you out of luck since it was over three hours after
you died, even though you were not on-line for those hours?)

Thanks in advance,
