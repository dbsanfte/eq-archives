Sharpening a rusty weapon will not help the damage it does, but it will make
it slightly faster (drop the attack delay rate by 2 points), which means
you'll swing the weapon more often in combat.  More swings in combat means
more chance for your offensive and 1hand slash skills to go up.

In Qeynos, no merchant sells sharpening stones.  You have to go to Erudin
and find a lady merchant outside one of the stores.  Her last name is
Orefinder.  She'll charge you about 4cp a stone.

To use the stones, find a regular forge (not a cultural one).  Place one
stone and the rusty weapon inside, and hit 'combine.'  If you succeed, it
will tell you you've created something new.  If you fail to sharpen the
weapon, it will tell you you've created an alterneate product (in this case,
the same old rusty battle axe).  If you fail, just put in another stone and
keep trying until it gets sharpened.

Good luck!
