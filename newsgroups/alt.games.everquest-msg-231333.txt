Well, no, thats stand, hit canni, sit back down.. but it is much the same.

Its been largely discarded on outdoor camps in favor of the mounted 
approach, although cannidance is arguably better for the lower levels. 
You see, you not only get mana back based on sitting status at the tic, 
but HP as well; sitting is several more HP if your butt is planted on 
the tic.  On horseback (drogmarback too) you get mana as if sitting but 
hp as if standing.

Its so much easier to just canni at will, though, that when you -can- 
discard the dance, most do.

And after 44, your actual hp regen becomes relatively trivial anyway, 
the rate you get off stocism is so much better that regen becomes a 
footnote, and the difference between sitting and mounted regen becomes 
an asterisk on a footnote.

Too, the fact that you can actually at a rate slightly higher than once 
per tic means your mana per second rate is higher -not- doing cannidance

It is funny though, that I saw this thread and thought back to my young 
clericing days rather than my more recent and more mainstream 
application of the same principles as a shaman, and even more recently 
teaching shaman my mage was playing with the trick that makes shaman the 
highest mana regen class in the game (they were -second- highest when I 
was doing this, then someone hit Mages with a big nerf bat)

Splendid
