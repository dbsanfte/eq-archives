A newbie should be able to make it through jusst about every time. The only
hard part is getting through high pass, and usually thats easy when people
are hunting there. A few tips...
1) Keep to the zone walls. Use the north zone wall through EC, WC and kits,
making sure to avoid the orc camps in ec.
2) Only cross kithicor during the day

Pity you're not a self binding class, else you could bind in the firepot
room and gate to most cities.
