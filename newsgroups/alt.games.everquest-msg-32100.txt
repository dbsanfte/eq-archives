You said to watch EC at night? How late? I usually work until 2AM (Central
time) and wouldn't be on till near 3AM (but could stay up till 6-8AM Central
time).
I thought of the same thing you mentioned about weight. I'll auction for
bronze and crafted and see what I get. I've only got 260pp at the moment.
I'm not sure, but I think I'm filtered not to show /ooc /shout /auction
chats. Or could it be just my bad timing? What was the command to filter or
not filter them (I forgot, never used it that I can remember of, but still
might have and forgot)?
