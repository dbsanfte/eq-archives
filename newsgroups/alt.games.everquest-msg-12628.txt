I don't think I've ever seen a more incorrect statement. Nobody solos
like an enchanter. At least not after level 12.

My chanter hit level 12 recently. I'm anxious to get to 16 for breeze
also, but not as anxious as I was to get to 12 for charm. Charm is da
bomb.

Here's how I solo:

Approach dervish camp in south ro. Camp has 3 mobs, 2 blue, 1 white
con. I cast soothe on one blue mob. I cast charm on the white mob.
Charmed mob starts coming to me, and other blue mob agros and runs at
me. The soothed blue sits around the camp waiting for his turn to die.
I back away from camp, and watch the 2 dervs fight (my charmed one,
and other). My pet wins handily (white con versus blue con), at which
point I send it after the other unkilled blue mob. Pet kills this one
also. Now pet is hurt bad, so I tell him to guard a spot. I walk away
and invis myself. Invis breaks the charm, but the charmed mob is so
hurt, he doesn't want to fight me. He starts creeping away while I
finish him with my snake fang. End result: I get exp from all 3 mobs,
and still have 60% mana at the end of the fight.

Certainly, this is not without risk. Get a bad resist, and I'll
quickly have the whole camp coming after me. I recommend getting a sow
before trying to charm solo. When it works though, it's a beautiful
thing, and somewhat unique in EQ gameplay.

ACK! This is terrible advice! Enchanter DD spells are incredibly mana
inefficient. At level 12 your DD will do like 44 dmg, and costs 45
mana. That is a pathetic ratio. If you must solo this way, a better
tactic is to rot the mob. Tashan them, then root, then cast your best
DOT, then med. You are recovering mana while the mob slowly dies. This
is much more efficient than nuking. The only use for chanter nukes is
when you are in a group, and mobs are dying too fast for your DOT's to
be effective.

Good grouping advice. I would add that understanding mem blur can be
crucial. Mem blur is incredibly powerful, use it. Charm can be a
lifesaver in an overpull too, but make sure your group knows what you
are up to.
