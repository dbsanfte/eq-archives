Cancel, Dispel, Strip, Pillage, Recant spells all strip apparently at random
when cast by mobs.

(Why random the other nite was my Rune IV and Symbol twice in two fights is
a topic for another discussion)

Many Dragons have an AOE dispell (that may be part of their breath weapon..
I've not fought enough dragons to be sure). It goes from top down.

Some dragons also cast the cancel line spells, which will shotgun holes
through your buffs.

In the dispel case instant click buffs give you more targets, 4 real buffs,
4 click buffs =  50% less chance of losing a valuable buff.
