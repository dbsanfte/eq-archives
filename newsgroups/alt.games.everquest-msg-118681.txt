"Need before greed" is an idiotic concept that relies on the honesty of
people you've never seen before and will never see again.  I've seen it
abused and attempted to be abused almost as many times as I've seen it used.

If you have ever participated in a NBG group, I would put money on you
having been screwed.

The people that call for "need before greed" the loudest are usually the
greediest, thus making it the worst-named loot system in existence.  :)
