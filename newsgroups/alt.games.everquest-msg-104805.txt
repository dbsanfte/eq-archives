 Sometimes we get an extra golem or two in Sleepers and will have them
kited until we're ready for them. Lots of room in ST to run around and
the Golems are fairly slow.

 Druid can do it but I personally would prefer a Ranger to if we have
one around.

 Agreeed. While a Shaman does have the spell, they usually have other
things to do. Druids should handle Regen duty.

 Are you sure about that? I'm pretty sure they get Succor but it's
called something else. They also get Translocate and I know there's a TL
to Safe Spot version that drops in Luclin.

 Oh, then again you said sub-50 so I assume you're referring to Lessor
Succor. LS is rather nice. I'm surprised the level is so low for that.

 Most people will agree that they are still versatile at 60. The point
some peopole get stuck on is that while they are versatile, they don't
really make or break a raid. When's the last time a raid was called
because there were no Druids on? Then again, you can say that for a
handful of other classes as well. But it's up to them to come up with
their own gripe list.

 A heal is a heal. Would I prefer to have Druid healing over no healing?
You wont hear me arguing about that one.
