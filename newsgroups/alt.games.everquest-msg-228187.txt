Now I mean this with respect, sir:

Lighten the fuck up.

Seriously, I'm completely dumbfounded by your response.  A "farce and
mockery of what it takes to maintain a marriage"?  You're talking about
someone's actions in a computer game.

And even if an EQ wedding between a couple that's already married is "a
reflection of what is already there", I'm not sure why that makes the
occasion any less silly than any other wedding ingame.  I don't see any more
relevant or noble purpose for doing it if you're married IRL.

I mean, if it's the motivation for doing it that makes an EQ marriage a
total farce, how is the motivation of a married couple going to be different
than the motivation of an unmarried couple?

And if it's not the motivation that makes it silly, what is it that makes it
silly?
