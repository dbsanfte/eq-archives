I am one of the many who have been having a terrible time getting
Luclin to work.  I hope that someone here will be able to tell me
where I'm going wrong.

I've got an Athlon 800, 786MB of RAM, and an ASUS GeForce 256 video
card.  I downloaded the DirectX 8.1 zip from Microsoft yesterday and
installed it.  I'm still using the original Geforce drivers that came
with the computer in May 2000.

I installed Luclin off the CD's, and went through the patch procedure
without incident.  I started the game, logged in, registered, chose my
server, and hit the big button.  The splash screen appeared, with the
"Loading..." text bar across the bottom.  When it went away, I
expected to be taken to the character selection screen.  Instead, the
game crashes, telling me Ddhelp had a page fault.

So I reboot because the computer asked me to, neglect to turn of my
antivirus stuff, and try again.  This time, it crashed because of
Eqgame.  I turn off all the new models, drop the resolution, kill off
my antivirus again, nothing works.  It always crashes right after the
splash screen, although not always blaming it on the file.

I've tried going to various web pages for help, but can't locate any.
I want to see if my video drivers can be upgraded, but the US web page
for the company that made it isn't answering.  Someone here suggested
deleting eqg_dx8.dll, or similar, and letting it re-download, but that
didn't help.

Is there anything else I can do, or must I simply wait for future
patches and hope one of them fixes my trouble?

David
(Would vcache have anything to do with it?  I was told to limit it
when I installed the extra memory.)
