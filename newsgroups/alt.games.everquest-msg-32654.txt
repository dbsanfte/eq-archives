The guy's name is Bait Masterson, named after the old TV (or was it radio?)
guy named Bat Masterson. Some people just read it "Master Bates" ..

Don't forget Wella Fargin and Wellford Fargin, the bankers in FV ..

And everyone's heard this one .. look at the name of the city of Qeynos
backwards .. QEYNOS = SONYEQ ..

The thing is, VI can do it. We can't. They could name a pally Sir Humpsalot
and put another NPC next to him named Lady Twodollah if they wanted. (Maybe
not, considering it's rated Teen) The thing is, the players aren't supposed
to. It's their world, their game, their servers, their rules. If you don't
want to play by their rules, make your own game. ;)
