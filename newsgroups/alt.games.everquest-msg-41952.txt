On a side note,

I tried transferring a bag in one of the empty buildings in Qeynos the other
day.

A soon as I dropped it I saw an NPC message - "thank you for the donation,
it will help us get our business off the ground" or some such.

Apparently the NPC from 2 buildings away picked up my bag through 2 walls..

From now on I'm sticking with Surefall Glade
