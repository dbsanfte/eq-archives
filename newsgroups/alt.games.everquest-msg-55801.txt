The placeholder crocs are around 28th, and I've seen as many as
five spawn at once, although the usual amount seemed to be three.
Assuming one can't be pulled by itself, I'd believe three high blues
would be rather tough to handle together for either class at 29,
especially inside in a limited space, although a druid might have an
advantage over a necro at that particular spot.   A 33 druid that
came along while I had the camp didn't think she could hold it by
herself, but that may be more of a reflection on her than a general
rule.

At any rate, I'd suggest a group at that level, even if it's just a duo.
