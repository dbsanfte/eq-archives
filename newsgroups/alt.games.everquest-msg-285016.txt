Today I ventured down once again into Dalnir's Crypt. As my research in
the Great Library in the Plane of Knowledge indicated, I would find the
tormented spectre of Dalnir himself deep within the tomb.

Only a few days ago I was back in the city of Charasis, this time with
four full groups of allies and a very powerful, high-ranking Crusader
of Greenmist who had a deep seated grudge against the litch queen,
Drusella Sathir. This time, she was present in the chamber indicated by
my research. The army I had raised was able to take out her legions of
undead and golems with ease, the powerful crusader taking down Drusella
with such ease that I would have scarcely believed she even posed a
threat had I not attempted to take her on earlier in the battle myself.

Yesterday, as I was back in the Plane of Knowledge, plotting out my
next campaign for what my research indicated was the final piece
required to obtain the Greenmist, an old acquaintance of mine, a Vah
Shir merchant, approached me with a mischevious look in her eye. Though
some may take offense at this, especially with the citizens of Cabilis,
I feel it important to note at this time that the Vah Shir are a most
honorable race, and I have found many parallels between their culture
and our own. But I digress. My furry friend approached, holding a small
box in her hands. She said it was something she came across in the
great bazaar on Luclin not too long ago, something that was of no value
to her but something I might find useful in my quest. Before I could
say anything, she had left the box on the table where I studied,
turned, and left singing some tune I assume to be of Vah Shir origin.
Taking the box in my hands, I openned the lid and looked.

I looked down at the charts and diagrams of the Sarnak fortress,
Chardok.

I looked again inside to box. There, gleaming in the torchlight, was a
greenish metal shard.

I looked down at the charts and tomes once more, shuffling through a
book detailing the greenmist. There, in a margin on a page covering the
sarnak alchemy experiments on the remnants of the original Greenmist,
was a sketch of the shard I now held in the box. That such an artifact
was to be found in the great bazaar, and at such a moment, was just
beyond belief. The timing could not have been better, almost as if
Cazic Thule himself had guided these events.

Without any further thought, I took the shard and rushed back to
Cabilis. Though I wanted to rush straight to Dalnir's Crypt, I also
knew my mate, the Swift Tail Nivis, also had business she wanted to
attend to in the depths of the crypt. We worked our way down to the
lowest levels of the crypt. As my mate kept the sarnaks busy, I
approached the tormented merchant who my research showed to be the
great Dalnir himself. Handing him the mirror as per the instructions I
had gathered from countless tomes in the Great Library, the Haggle
Baron Dalnir appeared before me. I handed him the items he requested,
and with the speed of one who is outside of time itself had copied down
the plans for the unholy khukri, then just as quickly dissippated into
the nothingness the formerly tormented spectre had requested.

Carefully taking the precious plans, I headed over to the Dalnir forge.
Following the instructions from the book given to me by Heirophant
Oxyn, the instructions just obtained from Dalnir himself, and the
instructions I had obtained from the Great Library I worked the
components in the magics of the forge. Thank Cazic Thule for the magics
of the forge, for my own smithing skills are not the greatest, much
less a match for the legendary Dalnir.

As the magics of the forge finished on the various components, I
brought forth my new blade; the long sought after Greenmist, unholy
khukri of Rile Sathir. Once thought the pinnacle of Crusader of
Greenmist acheivement, as I held the blade I realized my folly. This
was not the final achievement of being a Crusader of Greenmist. This
was only the final step in becoming a Crusader of Greenmist. I have
only just begun!

Xiphosuran is my 55 SK main on Luclin. Two weekends ago, I got together
a small group of 53-70 to go through Charasis only to find Drusella was
not up. This past weekend, I got four different groups, one for each
wing of Charasis, over a 14 hour span. The first group became bord
trying to get the key-holding mob for the west wing to spawn. The
second and third groups started to fall asleep, though it was enough
for me to get the Hand of Glory. I'd just like to say that that thing
is just gross. After a few hours of hanging around the entrance, trying
to find people willing AND with keys (a difficult combination) I
neglected to snare the battle-sperm who ran and got me killed in short
order. After a corpse summons, I headed back to Cabilis to take care of
a few items and call it a night when I happened across a 75 iksar SK.
He did not have the mirror, but he did have a hankering to see Drusella
for himself. 30 minutes later I had my mirror, he had his Drusella
sighting, and everyone was happy. My bazaar mule is a Vah Shir bard. On
a whim, I decided to set up as a buyer instead of trader, probably
offering far too much for the Greenish Metal Shard, However I was
rewarded with the prize Sunday morning.

By Sunday noonish, October 1, 2006, I had my Greenmist.

I am happy.
