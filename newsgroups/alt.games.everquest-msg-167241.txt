Just as an aside, it's quite seldom that I don't have KEI or Tranq running.
On raids it never happens, and in groups even if we don't have a chanter I
can usually find a guildie to cast it on me.  So I'm almost always
WIS-capped.

However, that doesn't dilute your point.  =)  Yes, the extra HP is nice, I
hadn't considered that aspect.  It's like getting a VT piece with all those
nice +125 boosts.

OMG you have some nice stuff.  =)  I really really want your primary and
range items.  About the only item I have that's perhaps better than yours,
other than my new cloak, are my Boots of Flowing Slime.  A lot of the rest
of your stuff I'd kill for.  Virtually speaking, of course.

For reference, here's my profile:

I also notice that, like me, you still have your Thurg legs.  =)  I'm
currently working on getting my smithing to 222 so I can do Heraldic armor
for myself.  I was at every XtC raid for weeks and weeks just so I could get
in on the Hammer of Ironfrost when it dropped to get that nice 15% smithing
bonus.  I'm at 199 now, only 23 more skill-ups to go.  Then I can make
Salubrious Herald Greaves and Salubrious Heraldic Girdle.  The girdle
especially will be a nice upgrade for me - been looking for a good waist
item for forever.

Hehehe.  Truly, hit points have been a very minor concern for me.  I don't
even ask for Brell's or Boar or anything during a raid, since even if
something starts beating on me, other people get it off me quickly before
the extra hitpoints come into play.  I can see that it would be an advantage
in a regular group, however.
