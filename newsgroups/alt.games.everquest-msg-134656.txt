I didn't ^_^

(time-out to duck thrown things)

I played for about an hour before work.  It was a bitch getting in but I 
made it, with no problems.  Although it was weird seeing this at log-in:

Players on EverQuest:
----------------------
[30 Rogue] Taellaar (Dark Elf) <The Lords of Midnight>
There is 1 player in Oasis of Marr.

Roamed around a bit, enjoyed the smugness of having fiddled with the UI 
on Test and being able to answer the questions of dang near everybody 
(as in, all 5 people in EC ;)) *eg* and even played in The Bazaar for, 
oh, the 30 seconds I had before I had to run to work.

Ryou
(of course I know I've just jinxed myself when I go to load up 
tonight...)
