<<<You see, all the whining about soloing nerfs or KEI adjustment isn't going
to do a thing.  VI had the right catchphrase from the start ... you really
are in their world now.

If you don't like it, leave.  It's really that simple.

Watch that door ... it snaps back quickly.  Might hit you on the ass on your
way out.

Crash>>>>

Lol, so in this post you basically say that maybe you agree with me but we're
all mindless consumers and like good idiots we'll just sit back and take what's
rammed down our throats?  I still haven't seen anyone adequately explain how
someone else getting a KEI adversely affects your gaming experience.  Look in
the mirror, you just don't want it to be easier for someone to get to where you
got.  Stop worrying about others and worry about you and your group.  There's a
joke about you having some penis envy that I won't bother using.
