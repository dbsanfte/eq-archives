I'm an officer in my guild and have been asked to organise 3 raids, despite
not having been on one for many years! alas, that makes me one of the more
experienced raiders!

My hazy memory of raiding was mistmoor, old cazic thule, and guk (i think
upper?). I'm a level 52 druid and one of the higher level characters, and i
think the average is 30 (trying hard to raise it). Any suggestions? Are
there sites on how/where to raid?

We are a small guild of about 20 members.
