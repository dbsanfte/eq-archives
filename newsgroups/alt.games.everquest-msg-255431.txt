Ever have to kill Coirnav when you're extremely short on the right DPS
classes? Ever had to basically make sure that at every single point in the
fight, you were either nuking, tashing, or AE mezzing? Ever had the timer
tick down to 20.. 15.. 10 seconds, and eke out a victory in the last 10
seconds of the fight?

Or for that matter, ever been on a Xegony kill where the very first wave of
adds was the dreaded spiders? Ever had half your CC team wiped out in the
first few seconds, and then been forced to basically lock down three (highly
MR) spiders for several minutes all by yourself, keeping an eye on your mana
bar to make sure that you aren't OOM when the next mezz needs to be casted,
and another eye on your watch so you can time the re-mezzes for the maximum
amount of mana saved?

Until you're overgeared for the encounters, many of the higher-end raids do
in fact require you to be 'hunched over the keyboard'. Xegony, Coirnav, and
even TRC to a point (though with TRC, that's usually due to fatigue
resulting from the intense boredom you experience). I think the biggest
difference between soloing/grouping and raiding is, with soloing or
grouping, if you die, you pick up yourself and more or less pick up from
where you left off. With raiding, if you wipe, chances are that you may end
up spending the next hour or so recovering from it, unless you got a cleric
camped out in time.
