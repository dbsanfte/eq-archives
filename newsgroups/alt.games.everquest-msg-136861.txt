Yep. I figured that out in the beta when they "tested" it. It was
pretty horrible. The only thing that made it fun then was you could
loot everything. PVP in EQ otherwise is pointless, is risk for no
reward. So you killed a guy who jumped you? What did you get? Not a
damn thing. Whats he get if he kills you? Some pocket change and the
satisfaction of bringing some grief to you. Essentially that setup
would appeal to two kinds of people, bullies and victims.

So have fun in the land of milk and honey of a blue server, where you
control what you do with your time for a change.
