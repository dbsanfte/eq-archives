Well I dunno about you, but having been a tourist in France and the USA, I
met a LOT more rude arrogant assholes in the US, starting with that bitch on
customs/immigration (Im quite sure that kind of attitude and treating of
passengers would get you fired in most other countries)

Sure there were assholes in France, I've met assholes in every country ive
been to tho
