As a native to the english language: 'pussy' is *widely* regarded to be 
slang for the vulva/vagina. And only slightly less offensive than 
'cunt'. I seriously find it tough to beleive you regularly see worse.

Further, even 'Pussy' meaning 'coward' is derivative slang of the 
offensive usage. First it uses offensive slang to refer to female 
genitals, using them as a metaphor for 'girl', and then tyring it all up 
with a deragtory stereotype (that girls are cowards).

Its unfortunate that someone may have been banned over an unintential 
mistake. (Assuming it was actually honestly unintended.) But it seems 
like this would easily make a worst offenders list of words to avoid 
using. 

The only reason it appears inconsistent/lacks transparency is that 
you've failed to attach a common slang definition to the word.
