Not stupid. :)

There are a couple of side benefits, but I think the main reason they
set it up this way is for preparing for raids/recovering from raid
wipes. Buff timers are suspended in the guild hall so a guild can
sit around and buff each other at leisure and not have to rebuff
after waiting for an hour for everyone to show up. The regen pools
are to help everyone get fully regened before heading out through
the portal (another thing in the guild hall.)

Side benefits are for imbuing gems or getting your spell casting
skills up. Makes it *much* faster to do both.
