Perhaps a misunderstanding over notation.  I meant, your faction can be from
-3500 to +3500, which is a 7k spread.  I have proof that you can go more
than 2k points in one direction, and what I consider proof that you can go
more than 3500 points in one direction (though that depends a lot on whether
some quest info was correct or not).

I have logs of the entire time I spent becoming un-KOS to Brood of DiZok. 
Granted, I probably started out "mid-range" and drove myself to maximum KOS
through many cleric epic fights back in the day.  But if there was a max of
2000 points of movement, that would seem to suggest that the 3162 positive
faction hits it took for me to become ally would be impossible.  In
reference to the above about it depending on quest info, many of those
faction hits were the result of item turn-ins that were "supposed" to give
+2 or +4 (whatever, don't remember now, but more than +1).

I was very consciously working on that faction, and to this day have only
taken one or two negative faction hits to it since I started working to
become un-KOS and ally.  As a matter of fact, since I have the logs, I'll
count those negative hits up...  three.  =)

Sadly most of my faction movement with FV was before the autolog feature, so
it is lost to history.  =)
