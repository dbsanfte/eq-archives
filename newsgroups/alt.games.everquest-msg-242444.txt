Let me try one more time...

Before this last patch, it never ever rained on me inside the areas that 
had actual roofs on them.  After this patch it does.  This is not limited 
to BoT, that was merely one example.  I am perfectly well aware of the 
fact that BoT is classified as an outdoor zone, as are many other zones 
with buildings in them.  In the past, when you were inside the buildings, 
you did not get rained on, even if it was raining in the zone.
