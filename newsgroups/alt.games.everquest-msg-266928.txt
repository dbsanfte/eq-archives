That's probably not a good idea, as AB is a role playing server, assuming
Australians aren't any more inclined toward role playing than the general
MMORPG population.  It would probably be a lot better to pick a "normal"
server and try to get the word spread that it is the Aussie server.
Otherwise, you'll either have a lot of people decide not to go to AB because
they don't want an RP server, and so end up scattered among the other
server, or you'll get a lot of Aussies with no interest in RPing coming to
an RP server, which is not nice.

Designating AB as the preferred RP server for Aussie's who role play is fine
(although the second RP server would be better from a population point of
view).
