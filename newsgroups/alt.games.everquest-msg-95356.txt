Ohhh, AE DoT songs, yeah.  For some reason I parsed that as buff songs.  I 
think because I assumed that any bard would realize why they got aggrod if 
singing CoD or any of our other nifty AE DoTs and snares.  You are 
absolutely correct.

Is the AE FR/CR at 54 then?  Yep, just checked Reeds, it is.  Battlecry of 
the Vah Shir is 52, but no longer AE.  It was when Luclin first came out, 
so I still have 52 stuck in my head.

Let me amend my statement.  Bards don't get AE buffs that will generate 
unexpected aggro from passing mobs until level 54.  Consider me properly 
chastised.
