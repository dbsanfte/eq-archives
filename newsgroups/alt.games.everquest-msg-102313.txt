I think it is a two way street, some players do not understand the nuances
of how another class is played, whilst some players do not understand the
nuances of how their own class is played. I appreciate group members
educating me, but get bored very quickly with lectures based on false
perceptions. It's a fine line we all walk as soon as we open our mouths
about another group member.

Case in point, hunting in a group on my then 30 Shaman against Rockgrabbers.
I knew from experience that the Rock's (especially the Crumbling etc) easily
resisted over half of everything I thew at them. Being primary healer most
the time for quite large mellee groups all I did was keep everyone on sow,
regen, quicken and throw in greater heals when needed and then stay on my
butt when not cannibalising - it was a cutting it fine manawise.

Every now and again some bright spark would accuse me of being clueless
because I wasn't slowing as well. My answer went unheard over their witless
frothing: "heals and buffs are not resisted, debuffs are and often in this
spot".
