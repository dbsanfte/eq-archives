i didn't explain it right :)

wanderers are occasionally an issue... but some of the denser dungeons 
with a lot of rooms and doors... you can't really see to lull. So the 
monk sneaks in, and then targets mobs for the enc to lull, and then 
pulls. If the monk misjudges and its a bad pull we've got FD to fall 
back on. But the main value add of the monk over a tank with bow is sneak.

Its faster and safer than FD splitting.

A lull resist is about the only bad thing that happens. But at least the 
enc is usually far enough back (casting at long range) that he can land 
an AE mez before they wipe him.
