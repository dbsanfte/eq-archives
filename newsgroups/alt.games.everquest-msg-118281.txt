  Enchanted platinum (or velium if you can afford it) peridot rings.  Cloak
of the Icebear.  There's +40 CR right there.  You can get some golden wolf's
eye agate bracelets for a bit of magic resist.  If a magician is present, he
should be able to summon you a +15 MR/CR elemental blanket (shoulder slot
item) as well as a shield that you can use that's +5 to SVC and SVM.  A good
neck CR (+10) item is a Torque of Hoar Frost which drops off snow dervishes
in Velious... I think they're somewhat rare, but maybe you can find one for
sale.  Crown of the Froglok Kings for another +20 CR.

  If you're able to obtain most or all of these, you'll probably get your
resists high enough to be pretty safe from Vox's AoEs.
