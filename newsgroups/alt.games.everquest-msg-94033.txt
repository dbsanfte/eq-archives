Sorry, but that's so illogic it's not even funny. It's not "hiding from 
your problem", it is in fact *solving* your problem. I was being pestered 
for ports; I turned on /role. I'm not pestered for ports anymore, but 
rather I can choose when and whom to port without any hassle or having to 
overstretch my /ignore list. Problem *solved*.

It's like saying that putting on warm clothes when it's cold isn't 
solving your problem, just hiding from it. Ridiculous.
