FYI, auto-split is working correctly.  It's thoroughly tested by tens
of thousands of players each day.  At one point on test autosplit was
set up to evenly distribute coins but that resulted in way to many
coins being produced.  Autosplit is currently set up to evenly split
the coinage while limited the number of coins produced.  The good news
is that your problems with loot will go away as you level up.  There
comes a point in the game where looting is a burden and all items are
no drop.  As beneficial as your recommended features may be to FM
there are a lot of zones that do not require these tools.
