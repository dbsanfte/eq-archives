Excellent answer.

I'm an officer of a raiding alliance, and that's *exactly*
what we look for when people come as new recruits.

We don't expect them to be superheros on their first raids.
We're ecstatic if they're just able to follow simple directions,
and not be whiny (or bossy/argumentative) brats.

Sadly, you'd be amazed at how many people can't manage
even that.

If you have the ability to listen, understand, do
what you're asked, and have a good attitude, we can
shape you into a useful raid member and will love
to have you as a regular participant.  We don't mind
training people.  We *do* mind having to fight
people's personality problems or mental deficiencies.
