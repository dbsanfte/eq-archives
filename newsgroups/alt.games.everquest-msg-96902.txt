GM contacted him on what appeared to be an exploit, but might not have
been due to a bug in the system.  Player became offensive. After the
player insisted he was on a horse, it became clear to the GM that this
was the case and there was likely a problem with the logs. GM informed
player he wouldn't be banned, and that the problem would be reviewed
by the testing dept.

A mistake was made, but the GM went back on his judgement. GM admitted
he could well be wrong. Where's the big problem?
