If I recall, passing in Deathfist Slashed Belts (from the Orc Camps in WC &
EC) to Cain Darkmoor in the Warriors guild will do this for you.  Its the
opposite of passing them into the Freeport Militia.  I think you have to
give him 2 at a time.  Check a website - this one is usually the best
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ - to verify this quest.

I think killing the Orcs (or at least all the orc pawns) in the first place
also helps your faction with these groups too.  Anyone out there - feel free
to correct!

(Of course, if high enough, just take out some of the Freeport Militia...
:=)  )
