Because the guards are of the right level, and they want to, and its
in character. I hunted in Oggok at around level 37 (admittedly that
was because the servers were so crowded at the time I couldnt hunt
anywhere else, but it was quite in character for me to be slaughtering
ogres. I never killed gnomes, and only had a brief in character stint
as an unkempt where I killed a few Dwarves until I was counselled ;)

I used to be in quite a RP heavy guild ;)

I seem to recall spending some of my late teens fighting guards in Nektulos
too, very exciting as the Enemy, the tier Dal sweep down on you and your
level 22 friend aggros the seargent, (or dragoon? Cant remember) and the
entire group struggles to take him down in his homeland.

Yeah, its a pain when the wandering guards die, but the *actual* newbie
guards (gate guards) are all like level 50 now and super-tough, leading
to the alternate question; If guards are that important to you and you
need them to survive why the hell are you hunting solo somewhere they
can be killed instead of the "safe" areas?

Others have every right to enjoy the game as much as you and fighting
and invading scary places is part of that - I get more of a kick
out of a siege in Neriak than yet-another-dungeon-crawl through the hole.

Equally, when I see the Dark types hunting gnomes in steamfont which might
have saved my little enchanter when being chased by 2000000 (or so it seemed
at the time) assorted minotaurs, drakes, etc, I died, cursing him (literally...

May your toes fall off and your children have worms, you traitor to
Akanon! ) but not really having a problem with a dark elf necromancer
hunting the guards.

Shrug. The game is meant to be exciting and dangerous... I can see the guards
provide utility to other players and there is a point of view which could say
as a result its antisocial to kill them, but does that then make it antisocial
to *not* kill them if you know of folk who are KoS to them?

Ill, doped up on cough medicine, and posting incoherent unconsidered 
argument.
