Two reasons it's a failed design concept:

2. Skills that don't scale well
-------------------------------

Slow and complete heal spring to mind. If you have the incredibly 
powerful ability to reduce the number of times per minute a creature can 
take a swing, and you make that ability scaling rather than static, then 
no matter how weak you make it initially, sooner or later it will be 
become so over powered that you will have to make content to assume 
everybody has it.

Complete heal, well the name says it all really, overpowered from day 
one and only gets worse as people's maximum hitpoints increase. Even 
limited to 7500 hitpoints, this spell will continue to be overpowered 
until most folks usually have many times that.

Slow should have been an innate and static ability for those classes 
that have it, like defensive is for warriors. Complete heal should never 
have existed.

Scaling badly in the other direction: Harm Touch! Lethal at level four, 
irrelevant at level 70.


1. Gameplay favors specialists by being more predictable and repetitive.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

What if it were just as normal to fight 3 less powerful creatures at 
once as it is to fight a single more powerful creature?
What if some creatures insisted on fighting at long range?
What if some ran at 50% health?
What if some refused to take on more than 3 players?
What if some creatures just plain refused to fight and had to be *hunted*?
What if some were too smart to be agro controlled, and had to be kited?
What if some could be enticed to fight or baited?
If traps and ambushes were useful?
If some creatures died with one blow if effected by the right kind of 
poison?

What if some creatures picked one or more of the above traits at random 
when they spawned?

What if there were ways for the designers to make creatures harder (and 
worth more experience) that went beyond "it hits hard and it has a lot 
of hitpoints"?

You would be willing to consider someone who is third best mitigator but 
who can handle the unexpected. Hell, you might well hire them BOTH.

Cheers,
James
