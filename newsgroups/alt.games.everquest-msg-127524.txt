Actually, here is a clue for you on some of those games...  Some of them
are out of print, or no longer played games.  The hard to find games.  Now
look at EQ... It is still in print, and not that hard to find.  It is
cheaper to BUY the game at the store than what you are trying to do, which
is sell the game in auction with the promise of a free account, which, btw,
isn't free.

No... You can just try to justify something that one, gouges the other
person for something that you can, in the future, claim to be a stolen
account, shut them down and laugh your ass off for not only getting your
money's worth from the game, but also ripping another person off.
