This tells me that my "expectation" of at least an activity a week is
not unreasonable.

I am not looking for a raiding guild, just a guild that has some
organised stuff regularly to keep my interest in the guild.

The problem is to find this information out about a guild before I spend
time in the guild. So, unless guild keep their web pages up, this is
rather difficult. The "how to find a quild FAQ" is not that helpful in
this requard.
