Don't know about any command, but they were listed in the patch
message when they were put into place. Generally, the hot spots start
at Mistmoore (20-30), then Tower of Frozen Shadows (30-40?), then
mostly in LoY zones (Gunthak, Dulaks, Torgrians) though Lair of
Splitpaw is listed -- though when I zone in it calls the place
Infected Paw and I am not sure about the xp despite being in range. (
