None of the common mobs in Skyfire are on RoS... they're all KoS to
everyone.

Only two ways to check it that I know of.   Zone into VP and con something
(be careful, a see invis wanderer can sometimes go to entrance).    Second
is Esorpa of the Ring in WW.   She wanders the ToV scar and is usually up.

The rare Kunark dragons are Ring of Scale as well, but as Ben said... you'll
almost never find one alive.
