The PC character level can advance much faster with fighting in a good group
than soloing.  But the down side is you become more and more dependent on
group to keep you alive.  It appears that if your character groups a lot,
the skill levels for in many areas simply don't increase as fast as if you
solo.  You become very specialized; tank does the all the hitting and
dodging and caster do all the spells.  I think group playing and soloing is
necessary in EQ for good character development.  What is your opinion?

Emilio.
