    Ok, you finally motivated me to find the thread:

http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessage?topicI
D=648.topic

    The background, in case you don't want to read it all: Faithkillz, a
former manaburn wizard on our server, used to argue that manaburn wasn't
overpowered, that burn teams wouldn't monopolize Kunark dragons, that it
took skill to MB a dragon, etc. Sephrok killed Wuoshi with himself, a cleric
(Darianne), and one other (Hamani - I THINK a druid) to show that killing a
dragon with minimal people was still possible. But he did it over the course
of ten minutes, exposing himself to considerable risk, and it required
skill. Since the manaburn pharm team got nerfed, on Quellious they haven't
killed a single dragon.
