    Hmm in all the grouping I did pre-thirty we didnt SEE chanters until our
20's and whenever we saw them, welcomed them. But then, nobody got KEI until
we were over 30, and I can see how people of lower levels using it could be
a pure rort... but in the post 30 game if its available, use it.

    I would want a lvl 45 chanter in my group before any other caster with
KEI except a cleric if we didnt have a C3'd up healer one or a bard (because
bards are so rare and their haste stacks... and once we got the bard i'd
definitely be desperate to get a chanter (if we didnt already have a
shammy)). I can't believe chanters have trouble finding a group, their crowd
control alone is priceless, and if it wasnt they DO have the best haste in
the game, and at 45 I'm still seeing groups basically meleeing mobs to death
in slow motion, so haste is everything.

    Which surprised me a little, I thought tanks would be tanks by my level,
and that casters would be doing most of the damage. BZZZZZT silly me.

    Atm my ultimate group would be:
    SK (me, ludicrous agro holding abilities, take agro off puller ASAP and
keep mob pointed away from backstabber and casters (half decent tank also))
    Bard (stacking haste is god)
    Chanter (best haste in the business, stacks with bard's, mezz's adds for
chain pull enhancement, slows give mobs very little chance to hurt us)
    Cleric with C3 (who nukes half the time because the slowed mobs hardly
get a chance to hurt me before our turbocharged melees rip them to shreds)
    Monk (uber chain puller, great dmg output)
    Rogue (turbo backstab dmg output)
