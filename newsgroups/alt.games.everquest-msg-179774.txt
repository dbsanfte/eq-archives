'tis true.  LOL.

And, quite frankly, yes... you SHOULD learn how to use snare correctly.

I'm going to assume that you know how to drive... ASSUME.  Of course, you've
never been in an accident.. or gotten a speeding ticket.. or even hit a
curb... you know EVERYTHING about driving, right?  Riiiiight..

There are many of us who know quite a bit about EQ.. and there are those who
do not.. and every level in beteween.  And, if you are going to PRESUME to
know everything, fine.  I stated earlier that we did NOT know everything,
nor presumed to have such enlightenment.

But, the amount of information we do have is (1) condensed and centrally
located in the guides we are willing to provide, (2) hard-earned -- some
common and 'not-so-common' knowledge, with a spattering of VL experience for
the classes that are represented.. and (3) information that was shared as a
group of friends.. just like here.. but also milled over, compiled and
tested.

If you took EVERY bit of information here and packaged it all up and tested
it all, you would have a similar, probably superior product than we have.
Of course, you'd have to take the time to test it all, resolve the conflicts
of views, compile it and then market it (Bazaar, here we come!).  That take
time, and effort.  But, for those of us who actually HAVE an open mind to
listen to what others have learned and have to say about it, those words can
save a lot of time.. and a lot of life.

Hell, I didn't even think being a ranger could be so much fun.  They say the
end game for that class sucks.  It may not be as poweful as a full blown
caster's end game, but I'M having a ball! =)

Anyway, point being, I didn't know.. till I TRIED it.  So go eat your
spinach or soemething... LOL
