Ahh, yes...  that fits nicely.  A friend and I went looking for a
couple of named Gnolls a month or three back, inside Splitpaw, and I
remember that they weren't there.  I wondered where they got to.

As an aside, it's a pity they fixed the error about 5 or 6 months
back, roughly, that had the Gnolls at Splitpaw dropping healing
potions and, sometimes, a poison-proccing sword called a Kicsh Der
Pavz.  The potions made life a bit easier there, for a while, and my
Rogue is quite happy with the sword  :)
