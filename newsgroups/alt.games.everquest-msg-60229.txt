Hi

Personally I dont condone the training , but I dont think I would have
booted for a first offence.  Also it wasnt very friendly to go discussing it
in private before talking to you.  I think that open discussion and argument
are better, especially if people are comitted enough to really get pissed at
each other and still stick together after the argument.

At the end of the day I would have said , "Thats a banning offence and not
something our guild does, dont do it again" and that would have been the end
of it .

S.
