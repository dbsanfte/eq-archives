Hello,

I have a lvl 42 iks monk and am looking to do some equipment upgrades,
lemme know what you think ofmy gear and what I should upgrade.

ears   = 2 orc fang earrings
head  = Shissar scale head band
face    = enshrouded veil
fingers = 2 5ac 55hp rings
shoulders = dvlorg mantle
arms = nathsar
wrist = nathsar
wrist = elrosi
chest = acrylia bp
waist =  FBSS
hands = Gen inlaid gaunts
legs = gatorscale
back = hooded black cloak
feet = shimmering terrorhide
range = goranga idol

weapons =
Goranga Spiked Club
Wu's trance stick

I want to buy a Baton of Royal Stature and dump the Wu when I hit
level 49, what would you recommend for an offheand weapon to go with
Baton? 

The goranga Club can only be equiped in Primary hand, but I want the
stun effect which I think will help immensly.

Naturally I can buy 6ac 65hp rings or something else??
Any other reccomendations?

Thanks,
