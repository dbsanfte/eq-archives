Here's the link to the article yet again, although if you couldn't be 
arsed to read it before, I don't think you will now. 11.441 is the 
number of rapes reported directly to the police.

Allright, then... Explain to me why the violent crime rates are, and 
have been, so much higher in the US than Europe? If it's not because of 
the guns, then the only other possible explanation is that Americans are 
inherently more violent and criminal than Europeans, although this does 
not tally with my personal experience of either. I'd rather think that 
the easy access to firearms is to blame, but perhaps I'm more charitable 
than you are.
