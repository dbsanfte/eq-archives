Well, that certainly represents the traditional thinking I've heard on him.
On the other hand, I've heard that CR's aren't that bad if you have higher
level toons as they just run right in and start /corpse 'ing - if they get
bounced, no biggie, the next higher level just does some while the first
runs back. Probably easier if you have a mage for CoH. lol.

Well, I'm still deciding how I'm going to approach it tonight. I figure if I
do it right there shouldn't be all that many corpses to fish out. ;)
