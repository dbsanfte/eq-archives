No, I am not suggesting that since you don't know it must be random.  I have
to say that I don't see anything in the first post in this thread that
implies any knowledge regarding Ragefire, it was a very short post that
provided 3 links, when I attempt to go to the websites in question all I get
is "Unable to locate host".

Here is the entirety of the post from Freek.  (I did have to go to google to
get it, as he is a very longtime resident of my KF)

Verant boys do post on their forums a bit.

Nice information for experience and mobs though!!,
