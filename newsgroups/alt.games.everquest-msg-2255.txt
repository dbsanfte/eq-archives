Is possible to know prior to buying an item of clothing or armor if
it's possible for your character to equip it?  Also, in order to buy
clothing or armor of a type your character CAN equip, will the size
trip you up if the item is bought at the wrong place i.e. can a
hafling buy clothes/armor in freeport?  Thanks!  Nat
