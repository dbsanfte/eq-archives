I will live with a player like this in Someone Elses Group, and do the best I
can,  provided he has amazing AC and HP, and doesn't get anyone else dead. 
Otherwise?  I won't be playing with him again at all...  
If I want a challenge I pick a hard dungeon, not a wildcard puller.  I'd rather
have an AFK chanter any day, (and I'd rather have NO chanter than one that's
AFK).
