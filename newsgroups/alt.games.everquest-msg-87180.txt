Ahhh, I understand what you mean now. I thought you were referring to
those online when they forced the roll, the original 16. 

No, obviously the 21 turned out to be enough but the belief in guild
was that it wasnt and that was what made porting in and buffing up
distasteful to me - it smacked of a "pressure" tactic to try and force
them to go early before they were comfortably ready (which they did)
for fear that my guild was there to completely disregard the Guide
ruling and KS sev anyway.

I was talking to some of my friends in the other guild yesterday and
apparently when sev died the remaining tank had *5* hp. They cut it
pretty fine ;) Any closer and he'd have been unconcious ;)

And no, I certainly wouldnt consider 20 an inadequate number for Sev
with the right balance of people and kit... but being forced into taking
a second best 20 and coming that close to wiping out is as distasteful
as having the camp "stolen" or the roll forced upon you in the first place.
