Honesty is not determined by whether or not you accept someone's generosity.
If someone wishes to bless you that is an honourable thing, and a blessing
is not to be considered wrong.  If I were you I would save the money, do a
bit of research as to what is the best bard items you can buy with it are
and I would also probably give some away.  But what you do with it is up to
you, it was given to you, it is now yours, but in my opinion to just drop it
on the ground would be bad stewardship.  And good stewardship is I find a
part of honesty.
