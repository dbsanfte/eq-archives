I've had a druid since the day EQ was released and they've always been a
great class to play.  Because of their lack of any specialty, some druids
through their whining, have been able to convince developers and others that
they have been weak at times. That never stopped the whiners from playing
their druids or from druids being one of the classes most popularly picked
to play.
