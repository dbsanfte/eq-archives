Umbral Plains.  My guild was having a mini raid.  About 4 groups.  I
was in the last 'leftover' group.  It was just me (52 druid), a level
60 rogue, and a level 55 wizard.  We got damned near every single
kill.  I made four bubs of exp that night.  Just a damned shame we
didn't make it to the Elysians that night.  :-)
