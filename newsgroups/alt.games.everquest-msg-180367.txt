It does but they regain it and as NPC casters (Wizards) they can nuke thru
just about any amount of abuse.
Best one I can think of for them is charmed pets for Enchanters, certainly
won't need to buff their HP's at all :ï¿½)

I thought the figure was closer to 7k in HP but I never killed one, only
nuked it with a 688pnt DD to prove to a guide what was happening then he
killed it.
