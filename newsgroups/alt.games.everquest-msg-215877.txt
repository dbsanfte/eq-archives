Icons are very different.  The DoT looks like a cleric nuke (hand),
while the fear has a hooded skull and something else.  From what
her guildmate said she thought she was casting her new DoT.  No
excuse for not knowing your spells at that level, imo.  Especially
going into an LDoN dungeon with no slower, no haster, no mezzer,
and no mana regen buffer.  We had no chance of recovering from a
wipe, so a wipe couldn't be allowed to happen.  When your whole
group is on the edge is a time to know exactly what you're doing,
not a time to (1) commit a very basic yet severe error, and (2)
not even realize that you f#$%^d up when the group survives your
stupidity and so do it again.  Possibly the most irritating thing
about it is that group could have succeeded in the mission, I can
pull mostly singles with the occasional double, the Warrior and
I were the highest levels he could tank mez an add just fine and
we had two Clerics to keep up on healing, with VoQ I had plenty
of mana for Pacify and chain-stunning those damned stun-resistant
chealers... but we had no way to recover from a wipe.
