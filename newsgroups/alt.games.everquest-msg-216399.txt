First off- Thanks guys for the /dism trick- that will be what I want I 
think. My main issue with it is mousing in a second or less, then switching 
my brain back to keyboard mode.

Hell, in hairy fights I bet I could just type /dism, not hit enter, and 
click outside my chat box. Since most of my attle comm is macroed, I could 
just do <ent><ent><d> in a hurry.

Yes, and dualboxing a druid I almost healed the wrong critter.

That's what I have been doing, but when I am ducking out of a cheal because 
it won't land before %t dies...

That works mid-cast? Cool.

My other beef is acceleration. I frequently, rather than whine like a 
bitch, root an add thats on me and back up. I take an extra hit or two 
mounted.
