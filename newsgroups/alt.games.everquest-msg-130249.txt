Lol your very deluded if you think/believe that.

My guild was doing a PoF raid.. we don't bother with mez/assist we just pull
x mobs, and people pick a mob

Anyway the magicians banded together and made their own little group, just
away from the main raid (pulling their own mobs and killing them).   2 level
60 mages with epic pets + 57 mage with pet in a group, to cut a long story
short... 3 mobs, I got exp twice.
