I tried to test how much damage these songs were actually doing by using
them on myself.  According to Reed's song analysis, at my level (47),
Fufil's should do 32/tick, flame and frost should be doing 48/tick.  These
are the amounts it gave me considering the instruments I currently have.
Instead Fufil's does 20 and flame/frost do 31.  I know that it's 30%
reduction when PvP, but does that count against me as well?

Just wondering...

TIA,
SEAN...
