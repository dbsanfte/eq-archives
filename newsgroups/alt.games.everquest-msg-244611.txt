I can vouch for that.  I joined the LDoN Beta with good intentions.  Then 
I noticed, hey!  If I die in the beta, it has absolutely no effect on my 
usual character!  This is the perfect opportunity to do all the suicidal 
things that look like they just -might- work, and find out if they 
actually do!  And what's more, I can beta buff a character up to 65 and 
explore some of the places I always wanted to see, but were too risky for 
a chanter to go to.  Although they didn't include a lot of the zones I 
hoped to futz around in in the beta... Velious ended at Kael, and ST and 
most of PoP was closed.

So needless to say, not much 'testing' got done, by me.  I did participate 
in a couple of the things GMs asked me to, so we were able to establish 
how much damage a raid of people who don't know each other and are mostly 
playing betabuffed toons of not-their-usual-class could do to an LDoN boss 
mob...  But mostly, I'm pleased that my betabuffed SK finally let me go 
see just where the heck it is that Vindi actually spawns.  And I finally 
got to see just how fast that Knight's AA horse is.  

And ultimately, it drove home to me the point that people like Ben, who 
actually -live- on the test server, are the only ones who are actually 
going to do any real, effective, testing.  The rest of us, even if we 
aren't distracted into spending a lot of time putzing around, as I was, 
will be on characters with no real commitment or constancy in that world, 
and that we may not even know how to play effectively, and hence won't 
even know necessarily what is a bug, and what isn't.

In summary, you have my thanks, Ben.
