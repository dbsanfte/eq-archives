Why would you need to? If you can post and read the post in alt.test, 99% of
everything you need to post in alt.whatever is working. send a test there,
and then IF you *really* feel you need to test a message in a.g.e then make
a post entitled:
Subject: How tall are halflings?
Body: I thought they were 4 feet talk but they sure look more like 2 and a
half in EQ.

Or any other silly thing you want. when it shows up its working.
