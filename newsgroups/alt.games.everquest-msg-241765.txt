One of the most painful things in programming is to take a currently
working engine and some time later replace it with another that is
completely different, and expect or get it to work. Making an analogy
to the automobile, I'm sure a Ferrari engine is a LOT better than the
old Ford pickup engine, but one doesn't necessarily go in the other
without major amounts of work, and in the end might not be better for
the application its being used for, Also, if the application is a 24/7
program where any downtime causes major amounts of grief you are
foolhardy to try such a jump. You typically want to update what is
currently existing, especially since you are intimately familiar with
the guts, and not just rip it out, slap in something new that nobody
has worked with, and hope for the best. If a complete engine removal
is absolutely necessary, you might as well completely overhaul the
application with a completely updated rpg, say Everquest 2 :>. As it
is, Sony has done quite good continually updating the engine over
time, while not having massive amounts of downtime as a result.

And companies who use typically program their game around it, and
hopefully even set it up so they can use a couple of the different
current engines. But that won't necessarily be relevant to the latest
and greatest engines 5 years from now. Interfaces and what engines
provide change over time given new ideas about how better to
accomplish tasks.

In the end, its much easier to adapt the engine in use to add DX9
capability than to replace the current engine with a completely new
one.
