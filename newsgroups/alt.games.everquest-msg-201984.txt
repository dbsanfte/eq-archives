You do bring up something here that you may not realize what you're saying. 
If my guild were to publicly post that we're taking Tormax down tomorrow at
7 EST, Tormax would be dead by 6 EST.  The burden of playing on a
hyper-competitive server at a hyper-competitive level.  Announcing our
intentions would do far more harm than good.  The guildmotd often includes
the phrase "go /role".
