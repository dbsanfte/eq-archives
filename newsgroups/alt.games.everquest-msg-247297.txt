/agree

Don't give the the example of a bard, either. I played one and if I had 
anything that needed saying, I said it. If you can become fast at typing 
"plz", then you can become within a fraction of a second of being just as 
fast typing "please" and not be speaking some kind of shorthand 
gibberish.

I also can tolerate it without any trouble. I'm just saying it annoys me.
