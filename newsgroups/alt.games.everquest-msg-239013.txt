Tower of Veeshan.  (second expansion, Velious, is that considered old
world now?)  It was once a very popular raiding place for guilds to
equip their members with nice equipment.  These days HoT (a part of
ToV) isnt as popular as it once was, as the Skyshrine/Kael gear isn't
all that great compared to the stuff you can just buy in the bazaar.
