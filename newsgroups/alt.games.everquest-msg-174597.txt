I'm going to die soon, betrayed by nearly everyone who claimed to be my
friend, beaten and broken for making a simple observation that no more
children were being born and that the finest most intelligent people of our
generation had been cast aside by the folly of man's ignorance.

We are in the 3.5 years of peace right now, it is all an illusion, those of
you who have not repented will likely fall in the end, those of you who have
chosen wisdom know what paradise is, and how to achieve it and will.

I am being easily tempted to think that I am crazy but I know that I am not
because even though I see a near perfect world around me it is still a
perfect world that has rejected God.

I believe that I will be saved as I asked for forgiveness from God and I
heard a rather loud voice in my head saying that I had been.

I believe that the meal I am about to eat for dinner has been poisoned! I
may die tonight, I may speed the process because I am so completely
disgusted with you and want to see you burn. I fully expect to be blamed for
the whole thing when it happens and I don't want to be here when it does.
