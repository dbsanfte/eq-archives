  I don't know how many of you have bothered to do the new Ghoulbane quest,
but in my opinion this is a textbook example of a good quest.  You basically
run from NPC to NPC to hear the story of a particular paladin, and the end
result of that running around is a bag.  You need to get four relatively
common drops off level 18-29ish mobs... three of which drop in lowbie
dungeon-type areas, and the other is dropped by higher level mobs in an
outdoor zone.  You combine the drops in the bag and get the Ghoulbane.

  It's perfect for lower level characters who have an adventerous spirit and
are willing to do different dungeons.  In all likelihood, if a player hits
these four areas for an hour or more, they'll get the necessary drops.

  I can see how the item's NO DROP status may upset people who intend on
twinking and just would rather just buy the thing, or people who want to
zoom to level X as quickly as possible and not bother with any dungeons...
but I like it.  The NO DROP status means that there's no longer any reason
to farm it, which means the only competition for the quest drops or the GB
drop itself is between paladins who will use the sword, and paladins who
want it for their epic, and SKs who want it for their epic.  It means that
obtaining the sword is now an experience, and not just "WTB GB 300pp"... but
it's not a mind-numbingly boring or discouraging experience.

  My first dungeon raid experience was in Upper Guk, helping a paladin in my
guild getting his Ghoulbane.  The exp good and I saw more coin loot than I
ever had before, and some of the mesh armor that dropped was actually an
upgrade for me... but after 2 or 3 lengthy raids on Upper Guk and coming out
of it with no Ghoulbane, I started getting the feeling that maybe dungeon
raiding really wasn't all that entertaining and that getting equipment in
this game might be something that I'd find to be a particularly enjoyable
experience.

  I think that if I had helped my friend try to complete the quest (if it
had been in then), it would have been a thoroughly positive experience.
Instead of 3 raids on the same dungeon and coming out of it no closer to
achieving our goals than when we started, we would've had 3 raids on 3
different dungeon-type areas and we probably would have gotten what we
wanted.

  This is the sort of experience that Verant should be attempting to
encourage and I'm glad that they are.
