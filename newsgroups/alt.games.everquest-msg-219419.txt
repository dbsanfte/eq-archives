There are people who enjoy them overall. *shrug* It's a big issue to
you, fine. But to speak for everyone else and to say that no one
thinks the system is good is just plain wrong.

It's the most sensible alternative...

Which is a slight flaw in the system, but the idea that leveling
represents is the same. Just because some wizards are PLed doesn't
make the system bad.

There used to be a big market for banded back in the day... The
problem here is the player economy, not the tradeskill system itself.

That's still not the "invention" of a new spell. It's finding lost
parts of someone else's work. These are lost spells that you're not
going to find cloistered in a tower...
