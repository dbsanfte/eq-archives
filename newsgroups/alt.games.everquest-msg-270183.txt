I think you're underestimating the likely number of bugs and flaws in
both the tools and the tools used to test the tools. :) The more
complex the quest, the better the odds of something being broken. (We
will leave aside how SWG could manage to have so many NPCs saying
"TEXT_1", since that IS easy to find/fix...) But I am thinking of
other things. For example, in EQ2, I got a quest to kill orcs in the
Commonlands...difficult for a Level 10 rogue to solo. But I found out,
by accident, I got quest credit for killing the "grey" orcs in the
Ruins. Other issues which can arise include checking for completing
other quests, or NOT completing other quests, or...

All I'm saying is, it isn't as simple as "$NPC wants you to kill
randnum() Zone.Monsters.PickRandom(), because of $flavortext".
