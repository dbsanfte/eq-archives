It's pretty easy to get around even being KOS to dragons and giants.  I took
a level 35 to the entrance of Siren's Grotto with no problem.  I didn't
bother going further because I would have needed a wizard to port me to the
WW zone anyway.  In Kael Drakkal, none of the giants directly between
Eastern Wastes and Wakening Lands see invis, so just cast invis on yourself
and hope it doesn't wear off.  The high level giants outside of and inside
of the castle thing do see invis though, so if you see one of those you
probably went the wrong way.  Actually most things up to Siren's don't see
invis, which was surprising.  There are really no giants past Kael Drakkal
so you don't have to worry about them further in.
