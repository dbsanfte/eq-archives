Irrelevant, a lucky string of procs can let anyone hold agro, the
thing with knights is, they don't need luck. They can take agro on
demand.

Assuming those knights where competent, they where trying to let you
take agro so not taunting initially. That doesn't alter the fact that
an SK or Pally can take agro hard before the mob has taken even one
hit. 

An SK casting Dark on an incoming mob is guaranteed to keep agro, even
on a resisted slow where nobody has hit the mob yet. 
... always. 
... even if their main weapon is a rusty dagger.

With a knight pulling, a mob will usually be slowed before it makes it
to camp, with a warrior pulling, that mob will usually be beating on
the tank for about 15 seconds (if I slow at 90% health), probably
longer with an enchanter since they also have to worry about Tash
agro.  That mob just did as much damage in 15 seconds as it would've
done in 1 minute slowed.

Even that warrior with a BoC still has to proc before grabbing agro
but granted, that does make it a lot easier. I wish they'd just
randomize spell agro to some extent. If nobody could _always_ grab
agro with a single spell then warriors would have a much more even
playing field. ... not to mention making the game more interesting for
me.
