This sounds like a problem because of course they are being billed by
the same company, under the same name with the same credit card
number. This may trigger some kind of "billing twice" safeguard
filter. I'd change something since both accounts don't have to be the
same, such as the names the EQ accounts are under or just call the
bank since I assume you mean you have a checking account and are using
a debit/visa/checkcard? Let them know you will be getting two charges
which look the same and ask them how to work around what looks like
filtering to you.
