Druids don't get the shiny tin bowl.

And you left out going to Merdan Fleetfoot in Surefall to discuss his
lovelife, handing him a Rose of Firiona (foraged in FV), getting a
painting, going to Frontier mountains to give painting to a human
skeleton, get locket from skeleton as it desintegrates, going back to
Surefall to give locket to Niera (Merdan's love interest) in order to
get platinum speckled powder to combine with the clay you get for
giving a dwarf the jade reaver and the bowl pattern you get for
running groceries and junk between Felwithe and Timorous deep.

The epics are the same up to the point where you get the two shiny
stones from Ella and VS. The difference is what you do with them and
what follows them (for druids: cleansing the spirits of the world)
