I'm going out on a limb here, but perhaps he has pretty high Fire 
resistance? :P Anyway, our magic (not disease) based spells are less 
intrinsically resistable. I've ignored our fire-based ones for the 
longest time, but lately I've taken to sacrificing the slot I normally 
save for a healing spell and putting Ro's Fiery Sundering there. This FR 
debuff is usually enough to make Breath of Ro stick.

Yup, that'd be Tarbul. As for maxing your weapon skill... Is it because 
of roleplaying reasons? I see no other reason to bother.

I'm keeping it just as a memento of the fight. Then again, I still keep 
the eye of the first Griffon I soloed, and the 2HS from the first HG. :)
