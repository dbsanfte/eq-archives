He made up the 'camp' rule? You've never encountered someone calling 
'camp check' before or asking if you're camping something and left? 
Never? You're either very new or can't read... or lying. Everybody 
/knows/ what a camp is. There's a lot of disagreement as to whether or 
not they're real or not (and this disagreement is based on the idea that 
social rules are toilet paper or that social rules developed over years 
of play by people who have worked out a way to get along actually COUNTS 
for something) but their existance as a rule (social) is not in 
question. To say he 'made up the rule' is just insane.
