You can run them from the one machine, one install, one directory.
You do however need to activate the second account, which requires new CD
keys for each expansion you want it to be enabled for. You can buy packages
(EQgold?) that contain a bundled set of expansions with their CD keys. Not
sure if you can purchase a CDkey online, but that would be ideal.
