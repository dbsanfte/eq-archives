It seems to me that if one is buying a character, for any reason other than
just to strip it of all its plat and dropable items, or to use it short term
for powerleveling (e.g., I could see someone buying a character for a week
or so in order to two box with it to PL their twink), the only safe thing to
do is pay the $50 to have it transferred to another account.
