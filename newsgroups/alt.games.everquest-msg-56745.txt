Those spells have been around for quite some time.  The only issue is that
you have to go to the port destination on foot the first time, and pick up
the key (It's a tooth) for that port destination.  You don't need all of
them, if you have one for a destination deeper in Velious, you can dump the
earlier ones.  If you get the Cobalt Scar key, that is the only one you
need.  Also, any people you are transporting with you each need their own
key.  As to danger, I have heard that some of them are quite nasty, so far I
have had no problem with the GD destination, but there are some nasy mobs in
the area.  The Iceclad one is not a deathtrap, depending on your level, at
level 40, I just kill the derv if it bothers me, or if I don't have time,
outrun it, or root it a ways off from the portal.
