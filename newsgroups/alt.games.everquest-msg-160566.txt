Nope, it is a mouse problem and probably has something to do with EQ using 
its own mouse routines.

When you take over your EQ session with VNC, there's a "hot spot" in the 
middle of the screen where your mouse works.  It's like your whole screen 
is crammed into a 40x40 pixel area on the screen as far as your mouse in 
concerned when using VNC.  It's -real- tedious to use your mouse, but it -
is- doable.  If you go outside the 40x40 area, your mouse cursor sits on 
the edge of the screen.
