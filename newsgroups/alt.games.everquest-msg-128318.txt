Why am I suddenly reminded of all the brand new computer "experts" that were
born in the Windows 3.1 --> 95 era.  You know, the guys that insisted that a
3.5" floppy was a "hard disk" since it didn't bend like a 5.25" (granted,
they woudn't know what those sizes meant, and have probably never seen a 8"
disk <--- gotta make sure I spell that one right).

Favorite one was when I was buying a computer when I got to a shore command.
I had been out of the loop for a while, so I didn't know the current state
of the industry.  The salesman said it had a 1.1 gig hard drive.  He just
looked at me with a blank expression when I asked if it was RLL, MFM, or
IDE.
