There is no sense in debating with you..

Your arguments are so ambigious and non-specific that any
counter-point can immediatly be negated by simply shifting your
argument.

You make points using analogies and then, when I comment to the same
analogy, all of the sudden the analogy doesn't fit.

You dispute the very basic points of argument ("if you indeed really
have a family") to the extent that there is no common ground.  Did I
ever question whether you were really gay or not?  Of course I didn't.
I took it on faith that you were being truthful.  But you disputed
whether I indeed had a family or not.. I guess that is simply your way
of avoiding the issue and not taking a firm position. You know what is
being done to my family is wrong.  Yet, instead of conceding that
obvious and basic principle, you instead, call into question whether I
actually have a family. Bam.. Yer off the hook and don't have to take
a stand..

Like I said, you waffle on everything and can't be firm and definitive
about anything.  You want to insure that nothing you say can come back
and bite you on the ass, so you simply say nothing.  And you say it
often...

So, there isn't really any sense in continuing, is there?

You dance on the head of a pin and insist that you didn't mean "is" in
the manner I pointed to, but in a completely different manner.

As I said, a performance that would do Clinton proud.

And since you are politically a LOT closer to Clinton then I am, that
makes sense that you would emulate him..

So, if you want to take this as a concession, go for it...  It still
doesn't change the fact that you obviously don't have the strength of
your convictions and can't handle taking a firm stand on any issue.
You would rather waffle on issues and be so non-specific that your
points could be interpreted as anything.  That way, you can tailor
your arguments to whatever the situation is and never have to worry
about what you believe being called into question.  Because it is
obvious you don't really believe in anything..

So, go back to your loony left, PC lifestyle.. I am done with you.  

You are dismissed...
