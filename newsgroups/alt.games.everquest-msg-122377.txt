Logic?  Logic!?  I have to eat drink and breathe logic 60 hours or so
a week at work.  When I'm free to engage in recreation I'm ready to
go along with "Logic is like a pretty flower... that smells bad!".
I want to smile.  I'm all for a bit of inoffensive silliness.  And
what the hell, since it's usenet here, why bother squaring the circle?
Round and round and round we go, where we stop I sure don't know.
