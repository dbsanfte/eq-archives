I dumped DAOC like a bad habit before my trial month was even up. The
same things you mentioned appealed to me, but DAOC seems to try and
force feed grouping even more than EQ. Grouping is fun, but if you
don't have alot of time to play it is nice to be able to solo somewhat
as well.

I did cancel my EQ account, needed a break anyway and will renew my
subscription when I get home to install my fresh copy of Shadows, got
it at Best Buy for $20 after using a cupon.
