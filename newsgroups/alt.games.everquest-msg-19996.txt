Incase you are still having trouble, to heal yourself below level 9 you
must rely on bandages and Lay Hands.  They are both skills, put some
practice points into Bind Wounds and buy a stack of  bandages or find a
friendly enchanter that can conjure them for you.

Make buttons for these skills so they are easy to get to.  Lay Hands is
an extremely powful heal but you can only use it once every EQ day.  To
use it target yourself by clicking on your name and then click you Lay
Hands button. To bandage yourself click on your name and click Bind
Wounds.

If you don't have these buttons yet click on Abilities and then right
click on an empty button - this will bring up you skills and then select
the button you want.  Now place a copy of the button on you easy access
panel - left click and hold the button you want to copy until it
attaches to you mouse pointer then drag it to the new spot and click.
