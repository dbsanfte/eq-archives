Rubbish. I've been playing off and on - mostly on - for the last couple 
of years and can only remember maybe a couple instances of more than a 
day's downtime and/or any major problems for a day or so after. People 
just tend to blow it out of proportion due to sheer frustration. These 
same people need to step back and take a good look at the situation. It's 
not anywhere near as bad as it's portrayed.

It's the nature of software changes/upgrades/fixes of this magnitude.

Count 'em up. I'll bet your tally winds up being very close to the 
expected number of min-max'ers that play - those whose gameplay 
experience revolves around every little point of xp, dmg, hp, ac, etc. 
People shouldn't play an enchanter solely because it gives them some kind 
of advantage, they should play it because they like the idea of playing 
an enchanter. I can't think of any nerfs which should completely change 
which class a person is inclined to prefer out of pure enjoyment.
