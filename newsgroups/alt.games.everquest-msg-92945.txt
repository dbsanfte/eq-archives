Netiquette is one person saying what they liked years ago, other
people agreeing with them and then accepting it as a "standard."
I really don't give a crap about it frankly. 

I top post or I don't based upon the post that I'm replying to. In
cases where the person has to page all the way down, possibly several
times, to find what the new poster has added I think its better to top
post. At such times I greatly appreciate someone else top posting. It
seems way too anal and backwards to me to say that it should never be
done at all.

This is why I prefer weboard messageboards. On a webboard the orginal 
post stays there so people replying in the thread don't have to repost
any part of it at all but instead just reply.

Any one using Outlook at all would benefit from using virtually any
other program, preferably not one that is such a target for viruses.

So post the nettiquette stuff here if you want. Its mostly ignored
anymore though by the people who break the rules the most. An off
topic spammer is never going to read your nettiquette post ;)
