Actually troll shaman is a very good class/race combo.  You should be
regerating naturally as a troll, so just sitting around for awhile will
get your hp back.

Also you should have got a spell "inner fire" when you were created. 
You can use this spell to heal yourself.  There are better spells for
healing you can get if you save up the money. (note: inner fire is not a
healing spell per se, but it does actually heal more efficently, if
slower than the "real" healing spells you'll get until lv 19)

When you get to lv 9 try to have enough money saved up to buy the spell
"spirit of the wolf"  cast this on yourself and you'll be outrunning
everything.

Also I suggest visiting the website shamans crucible.  It has all the
info a shaman could ever wnat.
