hehe: they're calling Mistmoore for Grownups.
There is a camp called the chieftain. You leave the Dawnshroud
zone-in, hug high and left. Just as you reach the outside wall of the
Xin Thall city, you are in a corner that is a very safe pull. Your
druid or ranger can harmony (great spell) pull singles until the cows
come home. If trouble strikes, you've a very large area on the zone
edge back toward DP to park adds.
Also popular are the zone-ins to Akheva zone and Umbral Planes zone.
Escape is handy.
Decent drops there, though in 3 weeks I've only gotten 3 ranger pieces
for myself. The experience is good and the volume of mobs when you get
a "rhythm" is great.
