My cleric has been practicing safe fall for just Ages now, and
gotten pretty good at it.  I can reliably run off the cliffs in
Cobalt Scar and not take more than 300 damage, haven't
died from falling since my 40s... well, except once when
I mistook a SOW for a SOE and took the drop down into
the Klandicar Canyon without a care in the world.

Of course my safe fall differs from the one monks et al get,
in that I go boom and then heal up, while they don't take
the damage in the first place....
