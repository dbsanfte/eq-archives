My story is about someone I encountered when I was new...

Had researched a little and played number role-playing games, and decided
PvP would be a BAD idea to start.  Had barely gotten to ground level in
Faydark when somebody, who showed red to me, challenges me to a duel.  I
declined.  He then started following me around, trying to pierce me with
such razor sharp witticisms as 'Queer' and 'You suck!' followed by 'Duel me
or you are scared of me.'  Sad to say, after hearing those three lines, with
no variation for about ten minutes, I started responding, first saying he
should pick on somebody his own level if he was so tough, then telling him
to go play on a PvP server, then got mad and [ as a not so tough guess ] I
said something about him not studying very hard in English class as his
grammer was so poor - he responded he was on honor roll and I said 'I knew
you were just a kid.'

Well, he was livid, and started stealing all my efforts to kill for ep.
Knew just a bit about wood elf rangers so started racing north, as soon as I
got over a hill I ducked behind a tree and hid.  Watched in amusement as he
raced by, still yelling 'You suck!'  At that time learned how to work the
ignore list.

For all I know he is still heading north.
