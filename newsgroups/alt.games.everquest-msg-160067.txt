I seem to recall that Sony has mentioned that the hook is in there already
for identifying starting location.  I have to side with people who made
cultureless scum half elves that it is unfair that they are unable to
practice a significant portion of the high end tradeskills.  It would be
nice if they did indeed implement it based on your starting location.  Not
sure off hand what culture the SFG ones should have though.
