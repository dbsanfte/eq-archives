This is due to the incredible number of PC's in the zone.

ways to cope -

First is to pull in your clip plane to the closesest setting while
you're there.  (ctrl -  I think)


Second is to use the viewport command to shrink the amount of stuff
eq is drawing.

/viewport Left Top Width Height

so, if you're running 1024, 768 and want to make a 800x600
veiwport in the middle

/viewport 112 84 800 600

It'll run like you have it at 800x600 res, without having
to switch rezzes.  You can hotkey this, and the one that
resets to default  (/veiwport reset?  I can't remember
right off hand, and am nowhere near my home machine to check)


last you can simply look at your feet.
