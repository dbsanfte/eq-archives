}I'm curious as to how say +10MANA compares to +1WIS.  Is it the same
}or just about the same amount of mana?

At level 50, it's about the same, provided your wis is under 200.  For wis 
over 200, it's approximately 5.8 mana per wis.  Under 200, it's 
approximately level/5 mana per wis.

}I have a +3WIS with +20MANA talisman and a +4WIS with +10MANA collar,
}are they both going to give me the same amount of over-all mana or is
}one better than the other.  
}I'm aware that other stats may make one item better to use than the
}other but I'm just concerned about the wis/mana question.

Which one looks sexier?
