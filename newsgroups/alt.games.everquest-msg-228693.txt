    If I didn't play EQ, I'd have bought pretty much every title Black Isle
released. I have Baldur's Gate and the original Fallout, and would have
bought Fallout II and the further AD&D games as well. A few people involved
with computer gaming that I know have reported much the same thing - since
MMORPGs have hit the big time, fantasy game sales are down. Gamers just
don't have the time.
