Not by a long stretch... Disabling multitasking was done intentionally, to 
make the use of macros (which arguably ruined the experience in Ultima 
Online) as difficult as possible. Now, the current thinking seems to be 
that EQ is secure enough that there is a possibility that they may consider 
removing that restriction at some point, but don't take that as gospel.

The best solution is to have a secondary computer running your mail and 
news software, but it may be a bit of a pain to set up if your desk space 
is limited.
