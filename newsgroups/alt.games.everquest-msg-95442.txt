Close.  I'll only OFFER to pay 1g per wing.  If they are willing to accept
that I usually give them about 10p for a stack + level 49 druid and/or
enchanter buffs (depending on which one(s) I'm playing).  If they tell me
that 2p per stack isn't enough then I write them off as a pure idiot and I
move along.

I NEVER give items/cash to those who ASK for it.
I NEVER save a newbie's life at a druid ring or EC tunnel  (I'm not here to
PL you, sorry)
I USUALLY ignore anyone under level 30 at a druid ring.
