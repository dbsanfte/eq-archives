If SOE is to believed (I think they are,) there are actually more
players today than ever before. There are also a lot more zones.
Unless you're in a "must go to zone x" level range, they tend to
spread out fairly well.

With my first 50+ character, if I wanted to XP, I went to OS, HS,
Chardok, Kael, or Skyfire. There was also Dragon Necropolis, but
nobody went there. Now, I can't even count the zones I could
reasonably XP in.
