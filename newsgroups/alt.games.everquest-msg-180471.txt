After hunting PoJ a few times for exp (mostly at the OZ but we once went
further in where faction hits took place) I can say it's almost not worth
the hassle.

Anybody fighting under lvl 57 appears to gain aggro of whatever wanders
by -- Sentry, pesty rats, and the odd prisoner who escaped because another
puller was looking while we were pulling.

If your puller is under 57 then you HAVE to get the Iksar first.  For
some reason he will always add no matter what.  Next the dorf caster will
aggro occasionally followed by the unmezzable drake.  If the place is empty
(and it seems to have been the last few times we tried) then you're gonna
be escaping to OZ often.  FD doesn't seem to work on these mobs when pulling,
or else I got hit often with spells.  Sentries wrap often and have sometimes
come back with the entire zone on their heels.

Definately a weird zone to play in.  Jailed helping their jailers, rats 
helping EVERYTHING (guess they're pissed because the only cheese avail is in 
Jaggedpine) and the super-power-hitting abilties of all Planes mobs.  Suffice
to say a caster with 1100 HP doesn't last long in this place.  The only GOOD
thing is that the graveyard isn't near anything that can aggro so you can
advertise for a rez and not get the cleric killed in the process.  :-)

At 54 I'm finding myself wanting more to go to PoD or PoN.  Better exp, not
as much crap to wade through (PoN trains are fun, tho!)

No sheet.  Although when the guardian's already low HP and you're just
about done with your mob, the hammer drop is nice for those who only get
the once-in-a-while diamond and have to roll.

Planes trash loot sucks, hands down.  I'm tired of being accused of KSing
a freaking HG by some ranger or dr00d who could kite 4 of 'em.  HHK just
got annoying because I can't bank anymore *sniff* but that didn't take
me long to get to.  *evil grin*
