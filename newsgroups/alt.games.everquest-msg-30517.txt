Jeez, calm down! thought I was bad.  This has gone from Bloody Euro's, a
silly remark, to you bordering on being offensive. I ain't no misguided
overly patriotic Brit! I am British, but I don't particularly like the UK,
you are making a very presumptuous statement there.

I was trying to say that the comment was a bit dodgy. How would people have
reacted if he had put bloody Jews, or blacks etc  This is supposed to be a
politically correct world we live in nowadays isn't it, so Bloody Euro's
shouldn't be a term that is used.  As for Carlo's remarks, yes, I understood
what he was saying, what I was trying to say... the point that YOU missed,
was it isn't fair to lump all of Europe as the same type of people, we are a
very mixed bunch!

Hey!, now you can point out all the faults in this posting too!  You can
pick up every example I use and turn it on its head, miss the point
completely and make me laugh a bit longer,  heh!

I bet you won't be able to resist....
