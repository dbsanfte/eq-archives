A few finicky details. :)

}/showspelleffects off will remove the pretty spell effects.

It removes most of them, you still have to turn off the new, improved, 
even more annoying effects in the options menu.

}alt+# 1 - 0 casts the spell in that spot

alt+# 1-8 actually, unless they added some new spell slots. :)

}Pressing F1-F6 targets respective person in group, F1 being yourself.
}Pressing F1-F6 twice will target the individuals pet.

It's not pressing it twice, it's pressing it when you already have the guy 
targetted.  if you press it twice with him targetted, it'll take you to 
the pet, then back to the pet's owner.

}/doability #number 
}abilities 1-8 or 6 are combat one 
}then you get the others.

This makes no sense. There's 4 combat abilities, and 6 normal abilities.  
I can't remember for sure which come first, but I think 7-10 are the 
combat ones.

}When creating the macro's, you can put " /stand " on the first line to
}save yourself time having to find your stand hotkey, and on the flip
}side you can use /sit 

Does /stand work now?  I got in the habit of using /sit off long ago...

}To check if you are hidden or sneaking type /target <your name> If it
}targets you, you are not invisible.

Now -that- is one more people should know. :)
