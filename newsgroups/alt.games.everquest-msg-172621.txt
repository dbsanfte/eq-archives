It's the stacking thing.

If a recipe calls for two metal bits, you must put them into the forge
*unstacked* - i.e. one metal bit in one slot, another metal bit in another
slot.

If you put in a stack of two metal bits, the forge considers the stack to be
one metal bit and combines appropriately.  So you're probably trying for
dairy spoons (requires two metal bits) but getting a scaler (requires one
metal bit) because the forge considers a stack of two metal bits to be one
metal bit.

Sony is trying to change this behavior, but they're still missing a few
things.  A couple of weeks ago I was making Ethereal Energy Rings and put in
a stack of 17 Ethereal Energy Bricks when I only needed one.  I hit combine
and the forge ate my whole stack and gave me one EE Ring.  That was very,
very, very annoying.
