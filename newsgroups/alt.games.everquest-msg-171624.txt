At lvl 10 you lose all your equipment when you die, and have to go find and
loot your corpse to get it back.  At lvl 11 you start losing exp.

You can do that but if you lose exp you can only get it back by getting
someone to resurrect you, and then you only get part of it back.  Finding
your corpse will not return lost experience.  You don't usually lose stats.
Exception:

For example, if you're level 15 and your swimming skill is maxed, and you
die, you won't lose any swimming skill.  You can lose enough experience to
go down as far as level 13 and your skill wont go down.  After that, though,
it will start going down.  This is to prevent someone from leveling to, say,
level 40, then dying repeatedly so that he'll be level 30 but have level 40
stats, which would make him far too powerful for his level.  At least that's
the way I understand it, I've never lost a level due to exp loss so someone
correct me if I'm wrong.

You can do that as well.  When you put your equipment in the bank, you can
get it back from any bank anywhere in EQ.  However, if you're traveling
through a dangerous area, it might not be possible to make the journey
without equipment and your gear might give you the extra edge you need to
get there safely.  While traveling naked means you won't have to go on CR
(corpse recovery), if you die you'll lose exp and time.  Personally I'd
rather lower my risk of exp loss and travel time at the cost of risking a
CR.  Of course, if the zone is so dangerous you expect to die there then you
shouldn't have been there to begin with :)
