Yes, but it's not a lie.

No, you accused Verant of lying to you.  This is what I took issue
with.  Many people seem to take the stance that when EQ it down like
this, that it's some kind of deliberate insult directed right at them.

Trust me though, the only people in the WORLD who want EQ to be
running, and running flawlessly are the people at Verant/Sony.
