I've been reading a character guide and the author mentions several 
times to be careful not to Fremzy certain mobs. Does anyone know what he 
means?

"There's a mob in there, Skeleton Lrodd, that gives INCREDIBLE experience.

...

  Also, be VERY careful not to frenzy this guy. You WILL die. And don't 
think that just because you aren't doing massive damage to him you won't 
frenzy him. His doing damage to you pisses him off as well."
