I tend to disagree, Ben.  I've played EQ since Kunark; I've suffered through
every nerf, patch, mispatch, repatch.  I've played every class in the game
save two; druids and necros never interested me.  I've dealt with two
administrations - yes, Virginia, there was Everquest before Sony.  I've
dealt with the Vision, and the problems since it was abandoned, and the
recent attempts to bring it back in a more-perverted fashion than before.

I was also in the DAOC beta.  Frankly, I would have dropped EQ like a hot
rock then, but my beloved wanted to play EQ so I stayed with a game I
thought was ok instead of the one I really enjoyed. Now that GoD has finally
completely disillusioned my love, I'm back to playing the game I enjoy.

Don't assume I'm completely blind - DAOC has faults, and they are many.  But
don't be blind yourself, either; EQ's problems are legendary - as many in
this newsgroup can attest.

The point I was making wasn't that EQ was horrible and DAOC is great.
Instead, I prefer Mythic's corporate culture to Sony's.  Mythic explains,
where Sony arrogantly tells you that you don't need to know.  Mythic's head
of customer support is an ex-EQ guide, which Sony canned from the guide
program from being outspoken and honest (ok, and blunt).  A review of EQ
patch notes shows "This was changed," if you're lucky.  More often, the
players find out about changes after the fact - or have you never heard of
'stealth nerfs?'  A review of DAOC patch notes shows "We made a mistake when
we did it this way, we're going to have to change it, this is why, we
apologize."  When Sony messed up AAs, some were refunded, some weren't.
When Mythic missed up Realm Point abilities, the dropped a temporary fix in
with an apology, and let everyone know that they're doing a total revamp of
the system, and are keeping everyone up to date with the changes complete
with weekly updates to the community.

In short, there are things to like and dislike about both EQ and DAOC.  But
Sony treats the customers as walking wallets, and Mythic treats customers
as.... customers, who have a choice to go elsewhere.

Oh, and as for the CIHYS comment - I'm giving the droppables back to the
guild who helped me gain them, as I consider only to be honorable.  The 'buy
a chanter cheap' comment was a joke - Frosty will be camping for the last
time in his native Felwithe, Rhian watching a sunset in the Plain of Air,
Raiv will likely camp with lev-song running at 50,000 feet over the
Dreadlands - he was always a joker.
