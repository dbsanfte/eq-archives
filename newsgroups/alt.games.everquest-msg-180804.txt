Um, Id have to say you are Incorrect..... I have on numerous occasions
been DoT'ed to the point of just a sliver of Health... and Yes  Bind
wounds did keep my sorry but alive...  This was as a monk...In Sol B
at level 40. bind wounds was maxed for the level (been maxed since
about level 18.)

On a  Necro I was keeping my self alive with Bind Wound when I was
totally oom and could not Lifetap for health, and was converting
health to mana.
