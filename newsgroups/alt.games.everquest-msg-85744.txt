This would work if you truly never wish to see the game again. To be
safer, watch them change the billing information.

It is considered tactful if you tell your real friends online you are
leaving, so when your character starts behaving all wonky we don't think
you've gone mad. Because if your friend has never been that class of
high level character, they will delevel quickly.

Regardless, if yer caught, the account will be banned.

To do it the way Verant would approve, have your friend buy all the
disks, give you the CD key, set up the account yourself, and pay the
money to have it transferred to a new account. It will arrive fully
loaded. Then let the friend redo billing on that account.

Seriously though, if you are considering leaving, just walk away for a
little. Do not delete or sell your character. Put the toy down, and go
for a lot of long walks. Play with your daughter. Play with other games.
Go do something else. Real life IS much more more important than some
game. And come back when you feel you want to, if you ever do. Your
online friends WILL miss you, as you will miss them, and that is the
true addiction in this game- the friendships earned. 

Do not worry about your character- it does not need to be played by
others. To me, if someone else started playing a character I knew well,
I would greive every time I saw them. I would rather not see him, and
think them happy, then know that was no longer my friend.

And if you do come back, you'll be really pissed at yourself for giving
your high level self away. You can stop payment  and have the characters
still there should you desire to come back. And you can just play alts
for a while if you do, and send tells to your friends. Odds are they've
got low level alts that will just hang out and play with you.
