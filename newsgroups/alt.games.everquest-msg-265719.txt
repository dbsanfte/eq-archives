Unless all the dropping targets are death touching dragon gods with
6000 dd aoe. Or something. When did this become about the uberloot?
That is designed to enter the world in a trickle, instancing or not.

While simultaneously wrecking the worldy aspects, yes. You know some
people see more to the game than the loot, right?

It does as well or better than instancing does.

Random loot from non named mobs is good for "average" loot so that
everyone can stay on the curve with average effort. For the "best"
loot, all you need to do is have multiple places to go for *similar*
loot. You don't have to apply all the solutions to everything at once.
All your concerns are addressed.

In your opinion. The opinion of someone a bit obsessed by having to
have a certain piece of loot, I might add. One wonders why you
couldn't go to temple of Yness fight to the heart and slay the great
keeper of Y instead? Or Zness and keeper of Z?

Too inconvenient to get to, perhaps? Not close enough to an instant
travel node? Maybe takes a different class loadout for your group?
Heard some rumors on the "internets" that temple of Xness is "better"
and therefore refuse to even try anywhere else?

Every good instancer loves their push a button get a pocket dimension
dungeon... convenience defined!
