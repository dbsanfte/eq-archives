From the perspective of someone who groups with higher end clerics, I
think I'd put Divine Arbitration at the top of the list. For pretty
much any pure casting class, unless you need something else as a
pre-requisite, Spell Casting Mastery is the best bet for Archtype AAs.
None of the others compare to a 10% mana savings on spells.
