Fox news is obvious bullshit.

That doesn't mean Npr isn't snip-happy too.

http://www.lemonde.fr/imprimer_article_ref/0,5987,3224--312415,00.html

"Veto. A propos d'une "r�solution ouvrant droit � la guerre", "la France
votera non"

That means : no to a resolution that would mean war, and (i complete) let's
end the inspections first.

I gather from your response that this detail wasnt' aired on fox news,
neither npr, then.

Btw, france never said it ruled out "flat out" war against saddam. Always
said it was better to end the inspections first, and listen to blix.

Guess neither this was aired on fox or npr?

Do you think it may have been the case with many other "details"?

But, hey you're probably right after all. France should "grow a spine" and
do exactly what it's told, like tony "the iron poodle" blair, and be heroic,
and fight for democracy, like the brave us soldiers that are going to bomb
the hell out of a third world country.

(saw the other day that wassisname "terrorism level alert", orange, red etc,
you guys have on tv. lol. drones.)
