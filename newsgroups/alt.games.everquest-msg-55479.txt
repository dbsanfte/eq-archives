Hm, so what's the truth about Durgoz, who starts the quest in
Swamp of No Hope caverns?He is supposed to have two Frglok
Knights besides him. How do you talk to him? Can you kill those
Knights without him attacking you? Or are they set not to attack if
you want to talk to Dugroz? And there's reports of him not giving
you the key at all after you hand in the quest items, his faction
being to low, rumours about having to be in wolf form and a load
of other fussing around. Can anyone confirm something simple
and working?
