Had that the other night in CC.

Shaman kept complaining "MANA NOW! - The sooner I have mana the sooner you
get your buffs!" This while our 3 person group had a monk fighting a mob.
What the shaman didn't realize is that I had mana going just fine (no icon
as you point out), and was twisting in a haste and a chant as well as an
occaisonal Amp all while fighting (no speell effects while off to the other
song in the twist - so blue lights only 1/3rd or so of the time). He was
close enough, and was getting his mana. geez.

Well, I think my tone of voice (ok, tone of type) gave the hint. lol.

I've always said - my bard, my songs. I'm willing to take requests, but they
won't necessarily all make it on the air... ;)
