Of course.  Why not?

Obviously, the game developers can reduce somewhat the prestige of
being a Jedi.  They *can't* do away with it totally and still have it available
to players.   This isn't EQ;  this is a known world with known rules.  Jedi
are powerful characters, far beyond the capabilities of those who aren't.
That's not saying they're invincible or that they can't be killed by even
"lower-level" characters, but it does say they're powerful.  Unless they're
"dark," they'll have some strict moral code imposed on them.

As long as the developers are true to the SW mythos, they'll still have
prestige.  And anything with that much prestige is going to attract power
gamers, even if they don't play them every day because the moral code
is a pain.
