Yes, I believe I had a crap necro... she/he was always in trouble. I spent 
an awful lot on heals to him, with nothing in return. I could not understand 
why he/she was not stealing life from the mobs... but she went down very 
fast and did not seem self-sufficient at all. Made me wonder if it was an 
ebay buyer... a lvl 52 necro is usually not that sucky.
