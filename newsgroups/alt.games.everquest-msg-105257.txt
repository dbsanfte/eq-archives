Ah, Mistmoore.  I've had many good times there, and seen many trains.

In the pre-Kunark days, it was a good place for mid-20s to get exp killing
yard trash.  We'd set up on the other side of the pond, and every 15 or 20
minutes a big train from way deep in would run to the zone.  Was always
impressive.

The last time I went there was several months ago.  Someone needed something
from the maid or butler, I forget what.  Something went Horribly Wrong, and
it seemed like the entire castle paid us a visit.  I was mezzing like a mad
fool, standing in the hallway outside the Butler's room, and could see a
line of mobs stretching down that hallway and around the corner.  The only
people left alive were me and a level 60 ranger.  He was dropping the mobs
pretty fast, but it was clearly not a viable situation, so I gated.

Amazingly enough, the ranger got out alive.
