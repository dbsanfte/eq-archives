The warrior epic is pointless. By the time your group can do all of the
encounters for the epic they can easily kill mobs that drop far superior
weapons for much less trouble.

Mobs at and above level 50 or so start dropping rare gems . If you need rare
gems RIGHT now the 2 best places to farm them are in hate or in sebilis at
the necrosis/guardian camp. They yield the most rare gems per time period.
