As we all know, mobs in EQ often have some standard lines they say, 
either when you aggro them, or when you kill them or when they kill you. 
I often get tired of mobs in EQ saying the same old things, or subtle 
variations of them. Like in HoH, they all say "For the Glory of Marr!" 
when you agro them. It's in character, sure, but it gets old.

That's why I was kind of pleased to be fighting in Sanctus Seru recently 
for various things in a number of areas. I don't know if the devs built 
this zone after an office beer and pizza party or what, but they sure 
had some fun making it.

When I aggro'd one mob in the courtyard near the entry, he yelled, 
"Killing outlanders and getting paid to do it. I LOVE my job!"

Upon killing a guard up in the circle, his corpse said, "My comrades 
shall avenge my death my butt! I'm coming back to avenge on you myself!"

Others, upon dying, said variously "Well, at least it was quick!" and 
"Next time I'm definitely asking for a raise."

A lictor of the heart, when I snared her to pull to the safe room, said, 
"Man, I should definitely get a bonus for this!"  One of her guards 
nearby, upon aggroing, said, "It must be embarassing to be killed by 
somebody who's essentially a glorified clerk, huh?"

I was cracking up the whole time we were hunting there.

Any other zones, particularly the new GoD ones where I haven't been, 
saying any really fun or amusing stuff?
