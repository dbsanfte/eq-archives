You'll be given a separate account for your guide character, and your
guide character will be on a server you don't play on or know people
on.  You don't play normally with that character.

Most of what you'll do as a guide is tell people the rules, or tell
people you are not allowed to help them, or tell them you will pass
their petition on to a GM.

If you want to help people, in most situations where people actually
need help, you can do more as a regular player, especially if you get
ShowEQ, than you can do as a guide.
