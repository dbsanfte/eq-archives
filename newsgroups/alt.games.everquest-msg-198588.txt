Maybe its because there get more and more european players, and sometimes
its hard for us to do raids ect. because of the time difference. after all
we are 6 - 8 hours ahead of US time., and therefore when a raid us
schedueled to start at 7pm EST, its 01 AM where i live ( may be wrong on the
actual time difference)
Personally i have no problems connecting to US servers or european for that
matter.
i dont belive its because people dont like americans, i may not like certain
things about US, but that dont mean i dont like the American players

it may sound silly, but hey  its early morning now  :-)
