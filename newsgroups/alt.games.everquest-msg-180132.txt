Yes, there is a damage cap that lifts at level 20, perhaps someone can
state the exact cap details.

The damage you are getting from the bow is about right. Assuming yo
don't have loads of money to buy the high end bows, you might want to
consider the following upgrades for your bow...

Shaped Ash, silk string - 12/41 manufacturing cost about 30pp sells
for around 45pp (this bow has a lower damage than your current but
also a muc lower delay, so is more effective.

1-Cam shaped Oak bow - 16/43 130pp to make, sells for around 225pp

Above that the bows start getting expensive

details

Magic boots allowyou to kick things like wisps which need magic
weapons, but the damage will always suck (unless you have high str)
