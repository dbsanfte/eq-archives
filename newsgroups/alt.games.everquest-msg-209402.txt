My point was that the Frost Giant Captain Resisted the slow and took
exception with the Shaman who casted it.

Most warriors pull with a bow.  Shooting a mob for 30-some points of damage
and then having a caster try and slow it only to have it resist will get the
mob to agro the caster.  Then, when said caster trys to run and you are
chasing the mob and caster down, Taunting is very difficult.

Casters need to allow the melees enough time to get good agro.  During a
fight a Wiz may drop an Ice Commet on the mob (over 1100 DD)  and the mob
turns to chase them but a quick taunt always pulls them back to me.
