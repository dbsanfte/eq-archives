    We had an ex-member that was petitioned because of how many corpses he'd
left in The Bazaar. The GM made him come loot each and every one, and
marched him to every zone in the game he had a corpse in and made him clear
them all. Of course, it didn't help his cause that he also liked to randomly
/consent people and nearly knock them LD from all the spam.

    Corpses can cause more lag than you'd imagine, especially if the nimrod
in question stacks them tightly. /hidecorpse is a solution, but only if you
know that it's a pile of corpses behind the building you're staring at that
are lagging you out.

    Well, as pointed out above it's not always harmless. I agree there's
likely more important things a GM could investigate, but it can be used
purely to annoy. Keep Norrath clean, clear those corpses!
