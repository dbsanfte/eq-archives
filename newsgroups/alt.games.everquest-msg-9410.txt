Greetings.

I posted a while back seeking advice on where to hunt with my main
character.

Having now reached 39 I am seeking similar advice.

I'm bored with The Overthere and Dreadlands seems much of the same, although
loot is better.
I also spend a fair chunk of my time playing my alt characters who are of
similar levels to some RL friends and most of the friends I have made
playing EQ.

What I'm looking for is a couple of ideas of zones where I can travel to
fairly easily and join a pick-up group for maybe an hour or two. I don't
really want to spend too long running across continents to find that every
worthwhile spot is already taken or there is no-one in the zone.

Your advice would be appreciated.
