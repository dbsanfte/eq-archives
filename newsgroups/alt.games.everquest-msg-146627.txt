Indeed, I belive this is because the container has many items inside. If a single 
piece of equipment takes some seconds then a bag with many items would take 
longer I gather. I think also it checks the container to see if any slots are 
occupied whether it has anything or not, so there will slowdown even for an empty 
container.
