Succeeding isn't a prereq to having fun though. Getting halfway thru, 
and getting a few adventure points plus some augmentation drops would 
satisfy some.

Of course I've made it clear elsewhere that i think the 4 person limit 
is pretty arbitrary. There is no reason that they couldn't support, 2 or 
3 person groups too.

For my part though, I've lined up a 4th to ldon with... we'll see how 
regularly hes online, after we PL him a bit...
