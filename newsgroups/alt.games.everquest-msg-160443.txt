It is my understanding that there are outstanding weapons of every type
available to warriors.  Problem you will encounter is that when weapon X drops,
which has FAR better stats than anything you now own, it may be of any one of
those weapon types.  If you have maxed your skill out with them all, then you
can take that weapon and perform much better than you did before.  If not, then
you have missed out.

If this is fine with you, then the only other concern is that you have two main
demands from weapons; damage output and aggro management.  Damage output is
always a simple issue of "what does the most damage", but Aggro management comes
in two stripes.  If you are MA (and that will happen a lot as a warrior) then
you want to generate as much aggro as you can.  Fast high proccing weapons can
be preferable even when you may have something else that does more damage per
minute.  If you are NOT MA (and that will happen sometimes in groups, quite
often in raids) then you want to generate as little aggro as possible.  Slow,
non proccing weapons can be preferable here even if you have something that does
more damage per minute.

Since you find 1hs and 2hs both acceptable, you should be perfectly capable of
finding weapons to fit those roles, although you may have to wait longer than
you would if you could take blunt objects and piercing weapons as well.

Hmm, Bash, on the other hand, can occaisionally be a vital skill... do you have
ethical problems with hitting casters with your shield to intterupt their
casting?
