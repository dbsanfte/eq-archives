    You're a person after my own heart, Lawless.  I've entertain similar
thoughts a well.  It aggravates me that someone has a bit of strategy
or a tip that could help others out, but instead of giving it away, they
try to make money from it.
    I know one plat guide, dunno if its the above one, uses "pickled 
gater" to make cash.  Very tedious, and not one I would recommend.
I've seen feedback from another that points to something called 
"crafted gems" as another, and uses jewelcraft.  Ok, I have no idea
what this might entail, never heard of 'crafted gems', and thought
that only enchanted jewelry sells back for a profit. For that 
you need an enchanter that's at least, what, level 8?  Even so, I 
can't see enchanted silver pieces selling back for boatloads of cash.

            just her.
