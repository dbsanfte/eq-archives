Exactly. They haven't done the patch and the game didn't have that many bugs outside of the hackers and trainers.
EQ they "fix" something and screw up 10 other things. might not be so bad but if it's something the fuks us over they seem to say 
"oh well they can lifve with it." but if it's a help to us it's "OMFG hurry we have to stop the game and fix this." 
I still see stupid little bugs from when i 1st started the game. They can dump this BS eye candy on us just to say they 
did something but can't fix a handful of tiny bugs in 3 years. Looks like sony took lessons from Verant before they took over.
