I could not disagree more.

If you want to speak for your own opinion, fine, but don't
presume to speak for the "general opinion".

The Armor of Ro quests were some of the most fun I've had in
Everquest, and the results were well worth the effort.  I was
still wearing several pieces of Ro well into my 50's.

The only exception is the Bracers -- better bracers are easily
available for less than the 210p you'd have to spend on the
Enchanted Platinum component for the bracer.
