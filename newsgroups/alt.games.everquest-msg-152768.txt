Can you imagine the damage a Bard could do with FD, though?

All three healers can solo, now.  Basically, warriors, rogues, and
enchanters are the only classes that require groups to level (and enchanters
less so, now that they've fixed that stupid pet some).  Give the warriors
and rogues better regen and bandages, and you can up their soloing ability
without having much of an effect on the group.  If a warrior could sit down,
and have the same regen that my paladin does with Divine Purpose, then
things would be better.

Well, there's quite a difference between want and need.  With the soloists,
verant is using the carrot method of behaviour modification.  With warriors,
they're using the stick.

IOW, if all classes could solo, it would ruin the nice hunting grounds for
the soloing classes.  "There goes the neighborhood."

And so we tweak them so they're good at both.  Hmm, doesn't quite sound
balanced.
