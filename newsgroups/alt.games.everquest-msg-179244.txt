Heh. I just love people like you in the bazaar. Makes it SO much easier to
sell my leather padding at the absurd price of 35 plat each when theres 2 or
3 other vendors selling at 120 plat or more.

Keep setting those prices high! Makes life a LOT easier for a lot of us, and
we appreciated the price supports!
