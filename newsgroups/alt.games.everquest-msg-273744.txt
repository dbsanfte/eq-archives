The "wrong lesson" can still be the "right lesson".  Believe me, I was
implying that it was the wrong lesson, but in dealing with you it is
apparently still the "right lesson" because owning up to and apologizing for
something is obviously *not* the "right" thing to do.

No, reasonable people "prefer to retain flexibility" by "deciding that it's
a valid change" and making it a part of the system, not by being wishy-washy
and making exceptions for individuals.  A leader cannot show "favoritism"
of any sort and retain respect for long.
