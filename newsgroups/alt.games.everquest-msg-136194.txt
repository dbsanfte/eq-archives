I've missed a good part of this thread, but this has to be said: anyone who
names a book "The God of the Witches" can immediately be discounted from
having any clue what they are talking about.

That really depends, primarily on what tradition a given Wiccan follows. The
Gardnerian rhetoric, or perhaps many Gardnerians would be putting it better,
consider their trad the only true one, and do not believe that there is a
continuous lineage of the craft, that Gardner is 'the one true messiah' to
put it with a wee touch of sarcasm. Any others are, at least in my
experience with Gardnerians, lesser offshoots of their belief system.

Personally I took that with an entire salt lick, as a grain of salt would
have dissolved in my mouth without being noticed at the time.

History is entirely made up of what the prominant/dominant people of the
times take the time to put down on paper. it is only as accurate as it has
been chosen to be. If you have not learned to keep a salt shaker handy when
you are reading a history book, then you have some work to do. Why would a
population of religious people whose culture has been assimilated by another
document their history in an obvious manner? <chuckle>

P.S.: What is a tailorer?
