Not impossible but damned hard.  Casting mobs work best for this, and
you can strafe behind them, it takes practice and isn't always a
guarantee, but when they start to cast a spell, strafe around them
quickly and back stab them.  Instill doubt is also helpful, but yes i do
tend to agree a rogue is not a viable solo class.  It can be done, but
it's damn hard.  Mine recently dinged 42 soloing a drakkel dire wolf
though, was trying for a group couldn't get one and was a kill away from
a ding, figure what the fuck, i can always run or die trying, figuring i
wouldn't be able to take it, but wanted to try anyways, I pulled a blue
drakkel dire wolf, by sneaking up and back stabbing it, melee'd for a
bit, got a sucessful instill doubt, but it broke before i could
capitalize on it, was about to run, when it turned and started it's
death march, I ended the fight at just under two bubs of life, only buff
was a sow potion.  It can be done, but i don't recommend it.  1-10, a
rogue can solo if they want, esp a barbarian with the extra stamina and
hps.  After they get backstab, They really require a group.  I also
think Rogue is THE MOST gear dependant class in the game.
