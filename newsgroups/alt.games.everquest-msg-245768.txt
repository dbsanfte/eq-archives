Good point.  I hope SOE takes that into consideration.  
I think the *idea* is great.  Alot of the people I play with regularly are
level 60 plus and never played in Crystal Caverns or Mistmoore or Gunthak or
Scarlet Desert.  So many *great* places they've never experienced.  
OTOH, Gunthak is not the easiest zone to get to without a port.  There really
needs to be a book there.  Call it *dumbing down the game* even more if you
like, but if SOE wants people to play there they need to make it easily
accessible.
