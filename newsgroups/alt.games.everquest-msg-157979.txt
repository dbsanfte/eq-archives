Put 1 point on the specialization you want to be your primary
specialization. There is really only one as the others will top out at 50
skill and don't offer alot of bonus. Once you have selected it, cast a low
level spell of that type until the specialization goes to 51, that will lock
it in as the main one. I recommend Evocation if you are a soloing druid.
Alteration if you group often or prefer your root dot method of killing. You
can change the specialization later on if you decide you made a mistake
though its something of a PITA to do so. As for the training points your
associate is right, save them for some new skill you might need later on
that you cannot increase by using or would be very expensive to do so. Many
a Monk was peeved when Kunark came out with its nice blunt monk weapons and
they did not have a point to put on the new skill to start it.
