I'm sorry? A group of pets? WTF are you talking about? I have a mid-level (32 now)
chanter and as far as I know the one pet at a time per customer rule still applies. =P At
least *I* always seem to get that annoying "you can only have one pet at a time" message
when I accidentally try to charm or cast a second one. Sure, you can mez multiple mobs
and charm them one at a time as the current one goes down; but that hardly qualifies as
"controlling an entire group of pets" as far as I'm concerned unless I'm missing
something here. If you've figured out how to have more than one at once, I would *love*
to know how you're doing it.

Besides, the original statement didn't say jack about pets, it said "a variety of DoT and
DD spells at their disposal" which just ain't so. Chanters get the choke DoT line and the
brain warp DD line (which has god awful recast delay and can get you pounded to goo
unless you are extremely careful about how you use it because it's such a taunt.) At late
mid levels and high levels, they get an AoE; but still, that's nothing compared to what
other caster classes get as far as damage dealing spells.

I stand by my original statement. Enchanters are primarily a support class (crowd
control, buffs, debuffs) and damage dealing is *not* normally their primary role. Mine
doesn't even bother to load a damage spell unless she is soloing. /shrug
