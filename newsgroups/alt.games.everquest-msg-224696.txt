Firing and reselling isn't worth it til after you've finished the
medium jars and bowls, and have moved onto Ceramic linings.  Fire
those and keep em (they stack) for some later steps.

I've been firing the Large Bowls, but the recoup on investment is
minimal.  More than the cost of the HQ sheet, but at 2+pp a shot, I'll
recoup every bit I can.
