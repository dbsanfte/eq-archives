I've gotten two Courage (Adept I) and one Toughness (Adept I) off
mobs, at level 12, so it's probably just you being unlucky, or maybe
you've fought less group mobs than I have?  They're probably more
common off group mobs, since after all you need a group to kill those
(unless they're green or you're a priest).
