Thanks everyone for the info. Unfortunately it's not working in Win2K with
that RAM installed either :) I've tried it with a few different sets of
modules so I don't think it's a physical problem but I guess it could be my
motherboard or the multiprocessors.

I'm going to try some more tricks to get it going in Win98 limiting the RAM
available and cache size.

Thanks again for the advice!
