He forgot to mention the bombings that we have conducted against many
middle eastern countries, most recently Iraq (recent as in 'this
year'). Iraqi civilians are suffering more than Saddam Hussein, but we
still bomb them to 'teach him a lesson', even though he uses it for
political gain. It's a farce. 

What happened yesterday was shocking, but it shouldn't have been a
surprise to anyone. We have these enemies for a reason. There's more
to this than fanatical religious hatred of Christians and Americans or
our support of Israel. This is retribution. It's a horrible way to get
back at us, but we've also done horrible things. 

I feel extreme sadness for the victims and their families. I feel
hatred towards my government for their draconian handling of middle
eastern problems. They are partially to blame for this tragedy.
