You have not demonstrated that.

Very true.  In fact, you can get huge swings with much larger
samples courtesy of EQ's RNG.  I parsed a few of my recent logs
for DPS, to compare to the BattleCleric logs.  When I saw that
my DPS varied from 17 to 29, using the same weapon with identical
buffs and soloing the same 4500+ HP mobs, I decided that it was
gonna take too long to get results I was confident of.  It did,
however, explain how it is that one day I can be getting a blue
per hour solo (with kei), and the next I'm lucky to get half that.
It also helps to explain why, over longer streches that include
several play sessions, Rangers (i.e. fear kiters) solo so much more
reliably and effectively than Paladins (I see the same variability
in mob DPS which can make for a miserable outing if the mobs are
having a good day).

Doctoring is not real issue, if you give the log results meaning by
specifying the conditions (class, level, equipment, buffs) then any
interested party can repeat the test to verify/debunk it.  This is
how scientific research is validated, if it's good enough for RL it's
plenty good for EQ.  But given the results I've observed recently I'd
say that the EQ's RNG demands huge samples before you can have any
confidence in the results.
