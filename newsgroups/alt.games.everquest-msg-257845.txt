Not real long, since when in a locked encounter, your speed drops to
'combat speed', which is different to 'travel speed'.

All the advertised combat features of EQ2 so far seem to have one thing
in common - restricting or eliminating certain tactics that work in EQ1
(and other games). This is not necessarily a bad thing, as long as their
combat system is flexible enough that new tactics become possible. I
just hope they're not locking it down so far it becomes too
straight-forward. Flexibility is fun for the players, even if it screws
with your precious game design.

Hugh.
