I had the impression that Tasks were intended to be soloable.

My first Task was easy - basically just a sightseeing trip from OT to SF to DL.  Done in
20 minutes, I don't remember the XP but it was at least equal to gain if I had been
killing mobs for 20 minutes.

My second Task will likely go unfinished.  It requires me to take down what will surely
amount to several dozen froggies in Sebilis.  SOLO?  Now, I'll grant you that this would
be an easy chore, if these were going to be toe-to-toe battles with a single mob.
Unfortunately, the froggies are low and high blue, KOS, social, and flee at 20%.  No way
am I gonna try to solo in Sebilis without a slower or a healer.

Best regards,
