I'd be more inclined to think a Brell worshipper for the water to wine
trick.

I used to play with a 24k connection, and did not run into problems as a
result, that is more of a latency issue.  Considering when he would have
been playing originally though, he may still be using a couple of cups and
some string, so that might be the cause there.  It's also possible that he
just had levitate going at the time.

As for the whole coming back from the dead thing, that makes me lean more
towards a monk, necromancer, or shadowknight.

It's a tough call.
