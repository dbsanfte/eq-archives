This is where you're completely backwards.
Druid root has a better chance of sticking on mobs than snare.  The
resist check modifier for snare/ensnare is higher than root.

Second, our swarm line of dots are damn near lure based.  Almost
impossible to resist.  Against a red con mob, our nukes bounce more
often than not and almost always hit for only partial making their
already shitty damage/mana ratio even shittier.

I can garantee you, root/dotting is FAR more efficient than
snare/nuking.  Snare/nuking was the method all druids had to use
before because our roots were so horribly broken (the damage component
of the root would actually give the mob a second resist check).

Porcupining isn't efficient.
It's sometimes neccessary since without it, it's VERY hard to cap your
Defense skill.  But outside of that, NOTHING in the druid's arsenal
beats root/dotting.  Even quad kiting can only match that efficiency
but quad kiting has the limitation of needing four relatively close
mobs in an open area.
