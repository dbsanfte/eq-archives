I am automatically very courteous to guild leaders, because I know that
good or bad, their lives are probably stressful.  Respect is something
different.  I've often found that people in positions of leadership are
not always there because they are good at it.  Sometimes they are just
pushier than others.  And sometimes the people who choose them are just
dumb...sorry, but they are!  So I'd have to agree with Graeme about the
level of respect relating to the respect I have for the guild in general.
