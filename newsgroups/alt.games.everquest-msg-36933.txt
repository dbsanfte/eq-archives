    I didn't think so either... but since I burned some, and have long since
gotten past the need for the runes of fulgeration, I don't have any to test
right now...

    Since you don't know what rune it is you tested... that's not very
helpful.  Actually, it seems you didn't actually test the rune, but just
looked at its name when you looted it... so it is PROBABLY not the rune we
are talking about.

    Certain runes exist by the same name (rune of ivy, rune of scale, rune
of dwarvenkind, etc...) do show up as different runes when subjected to
identify (top, bottom, middle... Azea, Beza, Chocoriffic... whatever)...
Fulgeration (to my memory) did not do this.

    Runes are for... oh, never mind it clearly doesn't affect you.  Just
give all your STACKABLE runes to the nearest WIZARD you can find.

    Probably the rune you were looking at was a quest rune, or a practice
rune, or a rune that simply says "(Beza)" as part of its name (I see these
on vendors occassionally, and IIRC they're practice runes... or some PAGE
and not a rune at all).
