Not even close moron, but that is hardly surprising coming from you.
My original post was a well-thought piece why I was leaving the game.
It was completely on-topic and relevant. For some childish reason,
this offends you. Rather than just move on or not read an obvious
post, you decided to personally attack me and start flailing away. I
believe most responses have backed me up on this. You are simply a
troll and enjoy the argument. You took it to a personal level by
playing the silly name game so I recipricated, simply that. So again,
you can't understand that you never asked a question, but you berate
me for not answering it. Get help before it's too late...

And feel free to continue to look like the hypocritical idiot that you
are. But not to worry, lots of folks see it to and have emails me as
such.
