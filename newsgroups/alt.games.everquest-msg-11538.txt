COME ONE, COME ALL!

The Povar-Tarew Artisans (PTA) will be holding a
trade skills bazaar and expo on June 2, 9-11pm EDT
(6-8pm PDT; 2-4am GMT)

We are a guild of craftspeople dedicated to the
advancement of tradeskills throughout Norrath. At
the Bazaar, we will have many player crafted items
for sale and will be able to take orders for most
others in

* Jewelry making
* Smithing
* Pottery
* Fletching
* Tailoring
* Baking
* Poison Making (limited availability)
* Alchemy (limited availability)
* Tinkering (limited availability)

The Bazaar will occure in five zones:

Lake of Ill Omen (by river/lake junction)
Greater Faydark (newbie lift platform, at the top)

East Commonlands (tunnel entrance, towards the
first torch)
Velious (Thurgadin/Great Divide)
North Qeynos (still undecided; likely outside city
a bit west of the gate)

Need pots and pans? Want to buy some Wu's armor?
Hoping to fill in those missing pieces of banded
or fine steel plate? Questions about how to build
your own skills as a baker? Drop by and take a
look!
