My little Gnome Wizard got KEI (the first time) when he simply helped 
someone out with a little transfer of a couple of bags.  Didn't even know 
what it was!  Since then, he's had KEI about 5 times...twice from 
freebies for helping someone with a mundane task (One was letting someone 
know where a no-drop item was), and three times from paying.  Of the 
times Miznit paid, one was because it just seemed the right thing to do.  
The other two because, durng a run to PoK for banking and spells, someone 
that was directly "in the way" offered it for donations.  

While it's there, I have a blast nuking stuff and watching my group's xp 
shoot up...always watching for root to break....throwing a DS on the tank
(s) before it goes away...and having fun killing stuff they've been 
fighting.  Then, when I see it going away, it's back to rooting, 
watching, DS's and trying to keep enough mana for Gating in an emergency 
(usually bound right outside the zone line).  And, if there's mana and 
the tank needs a little help to keep from getting dead, a final nuke to 
end the fight....THEN MEDDING!

Do I *need* KEI? No.  Do I like having it? Yeah.  Could I go (awhile) 
whithout it? Usually do.  Do I run off to get it again if it goes away?  
Never have, never will....can't afford to donate enough to keep KEI on me 
ALL the time.  But it is nice to have every now and then.

Just my story.  No, really, I can handle it.  I'm not addicted.  I'm not 
in denial.  Hell, I'm not even a good wizard...but I'm learning.

Miznit, E'Ci, little Gnome Wizard
