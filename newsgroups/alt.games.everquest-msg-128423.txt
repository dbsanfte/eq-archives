Nah. The monitor design leaves less room for Post-It notes.

Having done network support for an advertising firm with a ton of
Macs, every time I see the "Mac: It Just Works" ads, I want to scream,
"WHICH FUCKING MAC WAS THAT? COULD YOU SEND US SOME? BECAUSE, NOT ONLY
DO THE MACS WE HAVE NOT 'JUST WORK,' WHEN THEY *DO* GO WRONG, YOU NEED
A BACKGROUND IN VOODOO TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS AND FIX IT."
