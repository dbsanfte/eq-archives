Well, it's not much of a spoiler, as it's explained into the first
20pages or so, but ah well.  The reason he keeps doing that is because
Thomas Covenant is in the "real" world.  The Land has a tie to him
through the white gold ring, and calls him back to The Land whenever
it is in need.  Covenant, meanwhile, is convinced through a good part
of the series that The Land is only a dream, a hallucination brought
about by his disease... the fact that The Land only takes him when he
recieves a severe bump on the head or other trauma doesn't help his
sense of disbelief any.

But as the series unfolds, and he grows as a person, and starts to
beleive more in The Land and it's inhabitants, he becomes closer and
closer to his own redemption.
