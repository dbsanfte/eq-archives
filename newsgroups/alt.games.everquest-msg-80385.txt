Just like I said, "Drow" are a specific variety of Dark Elf. "Dark
Elf" is a general term used to refer to the evil race of elves in the
various RP systems.

My RP does include the existance of Drow because some people insist on
RPing themselves as such - however, those people have worked into
their backstory of coming to Norrath through some means and
acknowledge that there is a difference. My DE character is rather
arrogant and sneers on Drow. Refer to her as one, and she'll rip your
lungs out. ;-)
