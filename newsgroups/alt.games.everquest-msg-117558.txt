Well, my bard just hit 17 and got dual wield.  I'm at the level where people
tell me to go to Lake of Ill Manners, just like my Paladin did.  Problem is,
after ten levels there, I've come to hate the entire continent of Kunark.  I
just can't bear the thought of Tenjou wasting the prime of her life at the
sarnak fort, only to move on through the "approved" path to ultimate misery
in Karnor's (my paladin just did her first and last group there... I refuse
to go back while the Cleric's gem racket is in operation).

Something else to consider, is that Tenjou has spent her entire life
soloing.  She may end up being my main, so I do want to learn how to bard
well in a group, and possibly in a dungeon.

So, the question is, where do you guys suggest for a bard who doesn't want
to follow the sheep route?
