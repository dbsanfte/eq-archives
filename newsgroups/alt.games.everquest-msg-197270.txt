Where, exactly did I say it *promotes* it? I said it was "all about 
cohesion and loyalty." You have to be a cohesive and loyal guild *to start 
with* to be successful in getting members flagged for the higher content. 
If you're not that, then what is the purpose of the guild in the first 
place? Just stay with your small clique and leave it at that.
