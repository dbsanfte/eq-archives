Dont worry, Lance, when you start fighting tuff mobs you WILL face mobs that
fight that hard. All I can tell you from the point of view of a 60 war and a
59 cleric is....delete DL unless you use it on casters! I routinely face
mobs that hit for well over 500 a smack, in some cases mobs that flurry in
the 600's AND AE nuke! I always tell clerics that heal my war the same
thing....dont waste mana on that wimpy little 955 hp heal when each round I
am taking 3 to 4K damage! There is NO WAY you can keep up with my hps that
way! Against mobs like Vindicator, Statue, N ToV named, etc chain cheal is
the way to go....well, string cheal anyway! It takes clerics that know how
to operate this way to make it work, but when done right it makes these hard
mobs very doable, even with low numbers. When we do such mobs we usually
have 5 to 6 groups and let one tank take all the agro, then we usually group
that tank with 3 to 4 clerics and a bard!

As for Lodizal....well, not to sound like one of those elitist uberguild
jerkoffs....but last time I killed him it was me, a 60 rogue and a 58 cleric
=) He REALLY isnt that tuff!
