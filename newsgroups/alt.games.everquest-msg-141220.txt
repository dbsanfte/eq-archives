You modified my post. =/

All of those durations are 1tick/6 seconds too short when compared to
in-game testing, and the epic effect is NOT instant cast, 10 seconds IIRC
(don't actually have it to be sure though, rar)

Results from testing on the druids grove forums came out with higher numbers
than the spdat in all cases.  Only quote I can find right now is below:

Stinging Swarm: 13/tick, 10 ticks, 130 total
Creeping Crud: 21/tick, 11 ticks, 241 total
Immolate: 24/tick, 11 ticks, 264 total
Drones of Doom: 34/tick, 11 ticks, 372 total
Drifting Death: 65/tick, 11 ticks, 715 total
Breath of Ro: 92/tick, 11 ticks, 1012 total
Winged Death: 143/tick, 10 ticks, 1430 total
