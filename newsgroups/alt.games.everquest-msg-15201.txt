I seriously doubt it's that black and white, but a portion of what you say may be
involved. The reason I say this is that your post reminded me of an interview with
Brad published at Lum the Mad's site. (Don't have a link to it handy, sorry.) But
one of the comments he made seems, in retrospect, to be a foreshadowing of the
whole <Conquest> fiasco. It was, to the best of my recollection, as follows:
[sic] "You can never anticipate everything that the players will think of or come
up with. We designed sleepers tomb to require a well organized group of 50 or more
to complete. Yet, right now we have a group of six people down there farming it
for primal weapons.  What can you do?"
  As I said, not an exact quote, but it's pretty close. I think it really bothers
them when the player base exhibits creativity, etc. (or that and "exploits" if you
prefer) to highjack something they designed and beat it in a way they
didn't/couldn't anticipate. Perhaps this underlying resentment is part of the
reason for the completely over the top, extremely excessive punishment that was
handed down for that one incident.
  Given a chance to do it all over again, I'd wager that VI would have reacted far
less harshly and the result would have been warnings and *maybe* a couple of one
week suspensions and a warning to the guild.  However, once they pulled the
trigger and made some blanket statements, effectively drawing a line in the sand,
then it was too late to back down without looking like they were bailing out on
the GMs, etc. and appearing even more foolish.
