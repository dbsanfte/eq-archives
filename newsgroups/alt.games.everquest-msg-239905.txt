One of my guildies 5 Year old had a 30ish  Halfling Warrior he's
levelled up pretty much by himself. And once in awhile you can see the
kid running his Grandad's 65 warrior instead of his mom having to 2
box it. It's insanely  funny! And the kid is better at keeping aggro
than a lot of other warriors I've seen!

Way to go Frodow! Hehehe
