You don't suppose that just *maybe* not enough people liked the ruleset,
and the rest are doing in-character tells? 
*shrug*
I think a little more quiet in a lot of zones might improve the game.
There's room for a lot of in character shouts appropritate to the zone
or information about mobs in zone, etc. but a lot of bullshit could
certainly be cut out.
Just a thought.
