This has to stop. Now. Don't you understand that being called
a Nazi gets to people? Six million Jews, millions of gypsies,
Russians and Europeans killed. Most of Europe run over by a
gargantuan war machine. a six-year long war, leaving the whole
continent in economic ruin. And add to that the neo-nazis, who
still go around killing innocent immigrants in the name of
Adolf Hitler. Yeah, I wouldn't mind being compared to that lot.

The long and short of it is, comparing normal people to the
Nazis, or calling them Hitlers, cheapens what happened sixty
years ago tremendously. I for one hope we remember what the
Nazis did in the name of racial supremacy, lest we somehow
manage to allow history to repeat itself.

This thread, by the way, is an excellent demonstration of
what happens when someone does compare someone to the Nazis
or Hitler frivolously. The thread gets completely derailed,
and killfiles start firing like mad, no rational discourse
possible.

As for stunted vocabulary? Give me a fucking break, that has
to be a pathetic allegation. The values of the Nazis, and what
they stand for, were clearly defined by their actions. Saying
that Nazism and fascism are one and the same, then conveniently
forgetting about what the Nazis did, just to win an argument,
or to defend your usage, or whatever was your reason? Oh boy,
where to begin on that one?
