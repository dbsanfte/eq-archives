Why do you think verant is banning compromised accounts?

I'll tell you: scammers who sell or strip their accounts and then
ask for a restore.  In the sale case, there have been several published
incidents of folks reclaiming accounts they sold because they have the
original credit card number and CD keys. In the "strip" case, it's just
an a-hole would be duper.

I believe both of the above to be waaaayyy more common than anyone
packet sniffing passwords, or breaking into your home system.
Thank the ebayers.
