Tinkered fireworks can (well, could, I haven't done it in a
while) pull something up to 300 units away as long as you
have LoS.  I've used them to aggro things like Hill Giants,
since they look just like bolt spells.  Easier to do that
than to try to outrun the druids racing for them when you're
just at JBoot speed...
