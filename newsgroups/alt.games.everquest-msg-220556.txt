See? THIS guy gets it!

My own idea was along the same general lines. Instanced zones should
not be *dungeons*. They should be outdoor zones! Zones where it is to
be *expected* that you don't run into anyone else!.. and so instancing
makes perfect sense. You'd enter and have to make the trek to the next
zone (or could head back to the original zone if it got too hairy).

The plus side of that is it wouldn't be so lamely linear as they are
right now - I mean these LDoN dungeons make Diablo dungeons look good,
and I never thought I'd say that about an EQ dungeon. That is
disheartening. And it would remove the need for a Quake style
leaderboard... I mean, come on, what is this, a shooter?

My own idea for an instanced zone-dun-rite would have been a double
kill - replace the boats with something rare in all mmorpgs - players
on the defensive. The players want to cross from faydwer to antonica,
they get their group together, and get on a boat - and then they go
into their instanced zone, which is their boat making the journey
across while being attacked by various dangers. They'd be able to
choose the safer, but slower route (still going to be attacks though,
just easier), or the faster but more dangerous route. Or maybe have
many routes.

That's just one idea out of many that *could* have been done. But as
we've seen, the current set of developers do not exactly set new
standards in terms of imagination....

Yep not a shred of creativity to the dungeons whatsoever. Other than
the textures; they were well done.
