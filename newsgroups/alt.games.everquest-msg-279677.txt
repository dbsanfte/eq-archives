I seem to recall that I found mine many moons ago in Greater Faydark. 
There was a sawn point for the Shadow Wolf not too far from the last 
tent to he East of the Crushbone entrance.  It was near a very large 
stump.  The nearby area proved to be a fertile hunting ground so I was 
not bored while I killed everyone that spawned.  I may have the 
particulars wrong, but it was near there some where.  Check with the 
scrolls kept by Allakhazam (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/).
