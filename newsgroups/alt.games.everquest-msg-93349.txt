After reading someone's post, how are you back at the top again?

If you're reading a response, then the person should have trimmed it
to the sections that he's commenting on.  Newsgroups don't necessarily
have all of the prior posts available, and thus keeping material to
put responses in context is a necessity.

Unless you're playing Jeopardy, the usual pattern in English is
question / answer.  Thus when responding to someone it becomes quote /
response.

Further, if a person's putting their response at the top, under the
(often mistaken) assumption that you just read the material they're
responding to, then why do they bother leaving any of the original
material in at all?
