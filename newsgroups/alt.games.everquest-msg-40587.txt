There is a breed of people who use the net psychologists commonly refer to as
'wankers'.

They can be characterised by the following behaviour:
1.Microsoft bashing. After reading eactly how shit windows is they quickly
gravitate to some flavour of UNIX, linux is common, this makes them l33t and
superior to all 'windoze' users. After bashing Micro$oft, continue to bash them
at every available opportunity, use your sig to do this, behave as though you
hate M$ with the undying fire of a thousand suns and bill gates personally came
around your house and took a giant shit on your lawn.
2.Look down upon anybody who doesn't have your l33t computer skills. After all,
if they dont know how to 'Telnet to port 37337 use NETBEUI to gain Rewt priv
and cause a buffer overflow with malformed UDP packets' then they're obviously
worthy of your undying contempt.
3.Bash Microsoft
4.Persecute the JeffK's of the net with a passion fired by your
self-righteoussness. Berate these 'crackers' arrogance while displaying
enormous amounts in yourself.
5.Bash Microsoft
6.Since you built the ARPANET with your own two hands, slag off over 90% of net
users, behave as though some great injustice has been done with the
commercilisation of your internet, loudly claim to 'want USENET back'. and moan
endlessley about the state of the net today after M$ sold you down the river.
7.Bash Microshaft
8.Become the most arrogant, self-righteouss, unimaginable up-your-own-arse
prick possible.
9.Bash Microsoft
