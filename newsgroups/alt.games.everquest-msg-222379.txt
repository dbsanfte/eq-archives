I was playing a necromancer in paludal caverns and we got trained by a lot
of the fiends so seeing this I feined death and continued to send my pet in
to assist the main tank 2 ppl died in the group and a mage we where grouped
with then went on to give me verbal about the way i did things saying i
should have used my 30hp transfer to keep the tanks alive.
My reasoning at the time was that if I ended up with agro from the huge
train we had I would die in seconds and at least the way i did things
resulted in my pet helping to kill the things and at any rate my crappy heal
would do very little.
so I am open to critisism what would you do in the situation?
