I complained because it happened twice yesterday in Eastern Wastes.
Once quadding frost giants. The top one had a lore frost giant woven beard
that I need for the 6th prayer shawl quest.
The second time was quadding ulthork warriors. The top one had a lore tooth
or fang that I planned to sell in the Bazzar.
I'm now going to keep those two items on me when quadding in EW ;-).
