Hm, I have regularly done ringwars on my server [solro] and in general 
it is one or 2 allied guilds 'sponsoring' the war and providing 20 or 30 
people, and then calling for volunteers in different zones like POK, 
Bazaar, Nexus, and most recently the adventure camps.

One guild tends to make all the group leaders clerics/healers and let 
them choose from the mass of people milling around waiting to complete 
the groups, then assigning 3 groups to just in front of thurgadin to be 
the final line of defense...important but a bit boring so people who 
have done a lot of wars and are pretty mellow tend to be in those 
groups. the rest of the groups get placed in the center area, with one 
or 2 groups towards each wave spawning point as advanced shock troops 
and scouts.

Everybody is reading raid chat, but only certain people are allowed to 
speak in raid chat, but the general ringwar channel is open to everybody 
to talk in. All the instructions and orders come in raid chat.

They do the turn in fu to start the ring war, and from there it is 
pretty much ordered chaos, as the people in the main body of the raid 
respond to directives to go to certain areas and fight the waves of 
giants, and in general only 5 or 6 giants ever make it anywhere near 
thurg, and those tend to have everybody in hot persuit. the 1 of 3 
failed ringwars i have been in was caused by someone giving out a 
direction in raidchat that had the entire main orce go the wrong 
direction at spawn, and we in the final position got everyone except 1 
giant=(

hm, 22 ringwas, 3 losses....not too bad=) but it does take about 90 
people to do properly=)

And other than some specific loot, i think the lance went on open roll 
to all of the classes that can use it most of the time....since i did it 
for the fun i never really cared about the loot, i get crappy rolls all 
the time anyway=)
