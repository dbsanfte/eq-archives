Ok you've given the reasons FOR wearing black.. how about some reasons
against it now? :)

Its a fugly square helm, its really cool on my monk tho cuz its such a
unique look - if only I had a sword I could pass for a paladin! (until they
saw my damage anyway keke)

But it does NOT have horns,and it is NOT green!!

I think your just being paranoid.  You know *nobody* uses luclin models with
a videocard that can handle tinting right?
