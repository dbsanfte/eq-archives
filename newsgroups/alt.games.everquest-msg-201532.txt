Well I guess I am a bit of a slacker compared to these guys. I started
playing my Cleric around Feb 2003 and hit level 20 in like 10 RL days
of 5-6 hours per day. I hit 40 about 2 months later. 50 a month after
that. I'm just about to ding 55. I spent alot of time doing my epic
quest though (got that at 52) so that problably has something to do
with it. Also, being a Cleric forces you to group, so I get much less
exp per hour than a solo Mage or a Druid would.
