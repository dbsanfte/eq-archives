Hi all. I am new to EverQuest and had just rolled some characters on 
Stromm where it is the newbie server. However, since there is now a 
newer server, I am wondering if I should play there instead where 
theoretically, there should be lots of low level people.

I went to the TNZ board and found a post there bemoaning how the new 
server sucks because of transfers, how it will be a flop due to this, 
etc. What do you guys think?

It sounded good to me at first but then I saw that post on TNZ and 
wondered if starting there would be a mistake. It's a shame because 
starting with lots of other low level players on a brand new server 
sounded so good to me.
