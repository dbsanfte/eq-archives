Nope, I'm telling you.  I set up hotkeys and all that nonsense, general
layout and a couple of 'emote' buttons or whatever you call them.  Set out,
got killed, respawned at my start point, and had to set up my hotkeys and
emote buttons again because they'd disappeared.  Similar thing happened when
I got a kindly bloke to teleport me from WK to North Ro (thank you,
Jojongsa), and discovered that my settings had disappeared again.  Odd, I
thought.
