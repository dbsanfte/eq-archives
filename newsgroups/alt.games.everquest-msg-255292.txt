I don't think so. At least, I never bought LDON, and I like EQ2 so far,
so... YMMV.  The ones who are excited about EQ2 are more often the ones
who quite around the time of PoP, who missed the days when bronze armor
was really special, and who liked zones like Tower of Frozen SHadow,
Howling STones, Veksar, etc. etc...the one group-able places with a fun
storyline and variety.

OH, and tradeskillers.  EQ-L tradeskilling is something you do because you
want the end result (an item or a skillup). EQ2 tradeskilling is something
you do because the actual process is FUN.  Refer to my old posts about
people in beta being blown up at the forge. ^_^
