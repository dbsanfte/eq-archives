>>>SNIP<<<
>> if a Warrior goes below 2 life bubbles, they go into what is called
Bezerk. <<

If a Warrior drops below 30% of their HP, they will go into berzerker
frenzy, allowing them to hit harder or more often. It's automatic, as in the
instant you drop below 30%, you frenzy. Berzerker frenzy stays until the
warrior is healed to 45% HP.

>> I was intrigued by it... and only have done it a few times..... <<

I think I'm misunderstanding your post ... last thing I knew, only warriors
could frenzy. I've done it a few times, kept myself frenzied in order to see
what happens, and didn't notice any major change. Plus, according to
"Prima's Official Strategy Guide to Everquest", berserker frenzy is a skill
warriors can increase, up to the max of 200. I have not seen anything
confirming nor denying this fact anywhere else.

Does anyone know? Anybody? Bueller?
