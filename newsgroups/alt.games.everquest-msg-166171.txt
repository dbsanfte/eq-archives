Of course they would.  However they would also cost more exp.  And they weren't
available, I was.  I did say "with

was available to the group I wouldn't have been as useful.

Well for one thing, your sub 46 characters can't go, as they can't get into the
plains.  For another, no, you wouldn't bring a 65 ranger along for heals, ranger heals
suck.   Rangers, unlike bards, don't have particularly useful contributions to make
when well under level, unless a tracker is needed, in which case even a level 10 ranger
would be better than the best bard or druid you can find.  Yes indeed, parking a level
19 chanter alongside a working group that doesn't have better is helpful, as breeze is
better than nothing and stacks with bard song.  Sadly, your chanter will get no share
of the experience.    Also, the 46 bard is pumping out mana roughly comperable to C3,
and stacks with C3 if you have that, this is a somewhat different scale of things than
a breeze caster.

If you have a point, its not going to be found with pointless taunts.

My point is, a 46 bard can contribute to a group in the mid 50s in a worthwhile
fashion, and because of the way exp splitting works, the fact that his contribution is
somewhat less than a 55 bards' would be is made up for by the fact that he costs the
group less experience.  Just as you might turn down a 65 bard on the basis that his
contribution might not be worth him getting the lion's share of the exp, you might
gladly accept the 46 bard on the basis that his contribution is worth More than his
happy meal sized portion (after all consider the free toy).

I come, of course, from a cleric background, and unlike your ranger comparison, a 39
cleric can contribute very meaningfully to a group that is otherwise all level 60.
Higher level clerics contribute more, of course, and in a PoP environment you finally
start to see places where that 39 cleric might be a liability (heal aggro is
outrageous, and without at least CE you are going to have some serious trouble that a
39 cleric isn't going to survive) but I'm very used to grouping in situations where I
was by far the lowest level toon, and I'm aware of the basic principles involved: Don't
get aggro, Don't try to damage mobs, Do take a close look at what you can offer that
other classes in the group can't do better.

As a lower than group level bard, the principles are the same.  Put the weapons away,
bardic damage output sub 50s is a joke at best, in this situation its beyond
rediculous:

DOT songs are to be used only with extreme caution and only for their resist lowering
function, you must keep in mind that they will mean 18 seconds where you can't mez that
mob on demand.

Resist songs work, but don't think that they are going to help you resist, due to level
you are going to eat every spell the mobs try to land; on the other hand if you can
avoid being target of spells they can make a big difference to your groupmates.

Haste is good if they don't have a haste of some kind already; 20% faster melee means
20% more kills per hour if they are using melee to kill stuff.  Many people already
have haste better than this though.

Mana... well mana is almost always in order.  Depending on buffs and strategy, doing
nothing but pure mana song can double a group's mana production, where thats' the
limiting factor literally doubling the kills per hour rate.  Its boring, but just as
being a cleric called on to cast nothing but Cheals can be boring, its also an
effective use of the low level bard's capabilities.

Mezing... this is arguably the least useful thing you can do, as most groups have other
characters that can do the job via root, but its my observation that most people who
aren't chanters are extraordinarily bad at doing so.  Since a second mob in camp means
group is taking twice the damage, requiring twice the healing, if (as often is the
case) healer mana is a limiting factor, mezing an add doubles the kill per hour rate...
and that assumes the add stays on the MA and doesn't force emergency heals on him.
Since adds often go to healers or other casters, where the heal mana expenditure is
vastly inferior, it can really end up tripling the kills per hour if not extending them
by a factor of five or more (dead toons really slow you down)

Would a higher level bard be better.  Yes.  No doubt about it, since he can do all
those jobs better, and contribute meaningful damage as well.  But on MT at least, bards
are relatively rare, and at any rate, as I pointed out before, he'd also cost more exp,
so you'd have to factor that in to the question.
