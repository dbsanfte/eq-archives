Yeah, I saw that during the patch. I'm not trying to mine anything,
just make it easier to auction my junk. Instead of typing the message
over and over again and having to click here and there to add a link
while I'm doing it, I set it up to be more convenient. I don't care
about mining for new or hidden items. If they don't want me to see it,
I don't care too. Problem is, now they've broken my links and probably
they look suspicious to them and I'll have my accounts flagged.

Great. Oh well, If I get banned I can get to see the sun again.  =)

Take care,
