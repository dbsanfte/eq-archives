I have never used True North for anything but raising skill level.  The only
reason my Sense Heading is maxed is that it is hotkeyed with /loc.  I pretty
much exclusively use /loc for navigating.  It gives me the direction I am
moving, and lets me adjust my heading much more accurately than sense
heading does.  A friend gave my warrior a compass to help me get around, I
didn't have the heart to say anything, but I have never used it.
