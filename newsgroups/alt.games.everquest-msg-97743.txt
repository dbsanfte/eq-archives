Well, I have stayed out of it so far, but at this point I would have to
agree that Ben has gone way over the line, and lost what credibility he may
have had in this argument.

Personally, the changes are not going to bother me all that much one way or
the other.  My main character is at a point where they will not affect him,
my others will certainly be affected by it, but I don't see it as a big deal
one way or the other.  Personally, I did enjoy finally making my way out of
hell levels, finally getting to not see the spellbook, but it was a matter
of the punishment stopping feeling good more than anything else.  It did
give a certain sense of accomplishment, but I think that just gaining the
levels and getting the new spells and abilities and such will probably
suffice for that.  I do hope that it is not the start of a trend in making
EQ easy, only time will tell on that.

Oh, and of course, all of this is merely my option, nothing more, nothing
less.  No facts at all presented here other than my own personal feelings.
