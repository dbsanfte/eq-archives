>Just wondering, but did YOU ask the druid why she wasn't casting? 

More than once I had to "/g 20 mana" while healing ... A couple of times I had
to "/g oom" and start cannabalizing.  She didn't take the hints. 
Luckily the puller was going to HER for sows - she didn't offer them, he had to
ask. As I was the "new gal" on the block I hate to start making waves in an
existing group.  In the future I *will* ask for assistance tho, thanks.
