Well for the level of a guild to be in nToV in the first place, Vulak was
like free loot.

Not only was he a very easy mob, but his loot drops were absolutely insane.

So in true verant style, they let the first guilds pharm the hell out of
him, then when the next level guilds were nTov enabled (like mine) they
nerfed him :(

They replaced him with a "ring of vulak", which doesn't work.. would you
believe that? :)
