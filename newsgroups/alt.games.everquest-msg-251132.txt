As long as you do 1 point of damage to a mob, you get full experience.  If
the pet does all the damage, I think you get 25%.

You actually want to pull with your big nuke, i.e. FBoT and generate a
boatload of aggro right from the start.  You'll need to use the water pet -
the air pet will keep stunning the mob and drawing aggro.

I just want to stress again, as long as you do one point of damage to the
mob you get full experience.  The 51% rule was gone by the time I started
playing two summers ago.

I wish I had some advise on where to solo.  I did LDoN's for most of the
60's, but I did group some in PoV.   I never thought about trying to aggro
kite the HoH graveyard solo.  Those mobs do have a lot of hp's and you lack
snare.  The couple of times I did the HoH graveyard kite with a group thing
there were too many groups there.  At one point there were 4 different kites
going on!  Scary stuff.

I feel for you LFG.  I had a regular group of friends and once that broke
up, it just wasn't worth the effort of LFG or putting a group together, not
night after night.  Perhaps joining a guild is the answer to your problem,
but I know not everyone is up for joining one (I know I wasn't - joining one
with my RL friends was probably one of the things that drove me from EQ).
