That's part of the way we do it in the guild I am in.  We do use DKP, 
loot is assigned a fixed point value, anyone who is interested speaks up, 
all those that are close in points to the person with the highest amount 
are in on the roll.  I have not rolled on many items that would have been 
upgrades to me, because others needed them far more than me, as have many 
others.  Once in a very long while, we will reserve a specific item for a 
specific person or class, or set of classes.  We do get some grumbling 
from those used to a pure random system, but not much.  The nice thing is 
that it does reward those that attend lots of raids over those that only 
show up ocasionally.
