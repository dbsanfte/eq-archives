Why would a priest be attracted to a boy?  I am not saying homosexual
automatically = pedophile. 

I guess you are saying that those in the homosexual lifestyle do have
some special power that makes such a possibility, impossible...

Is that what you are claiming??

My point is simple.. Try to keep up...

BB/BS state that they don't have men be mentors for women and vice
versa due to, among other things, the sexual issue...

The sexual attraction of the mentor to the mentee...

The possibility of sexual attraction is there when a homosexual man
mentors a boy...

So, consequently, the "rules" that prevent men from being mentors for
women, SHOULD also apply to homosexual men being mentors for boys..

It's very logical..
