And who will be alive to rez them then?

 The idea was that you would get a cleric "on the way back in" before the
wipeout is complete....  before the last person able to rez (without
sacraficing Essence Emeralds, Rez sticks or other priceless reagents) dies.
That way once the monks or rogues, whoever survived, were done moving the
mob away, the cleric accepts and rezes everyone.
