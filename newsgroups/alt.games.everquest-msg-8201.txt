Hello friends!

This is just a general request that anyone who would be on within the time
frame of 10:30am EST and 11:00am EST and would not mind helping a young
guild get its name approved, I would like to invite you to the "Asag Order"
chat room at that time.

I'm sure all of you are aware that it's a lot easier to get a guild obtain
higher number of members once the guild is actually a guild (name).  Anyone
and everyone that could join the chat room during the above time frame, you
would be a great contribution.

Should you decide to visit our web site (which is still in works) the
address is:   http://asagorder.darktech.org  .  Thank you for reading this
and have a great and safe (in and out of game) weekend!

Jacobson
