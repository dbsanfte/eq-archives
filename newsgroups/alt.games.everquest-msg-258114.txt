128 mb>256 mb will do zilch for EQ, however, a game that is very texture 
intensive (such as Doom 3) will have to do more texture thrashing on 
smaller memory cards (swap textures between video ram and onboard ram). 
It is impossible to get Doom 3 on 'ultra high' by default unless you 
have 512MB video, because in that mode they use 510 mb of textures, and 
they only 'recommend' it if you can do it without thrashing.

That said, looks just peachy, thrashing and all, on my 128 mb card.

speed vs. space:
My 'near ideal' machine is setup as follows:
Nice fast SATA drive for the main drive... probably a 'raptor'.

plus one of these:

(beware the wrap)
and 4 of these

(beware the wrap) in 200 GB SATA to put in an 800 gb striped RAID array.

Though any large ammount of space in a spanned or striped array would be 
just fine. (Yes, I'm a data packrat. Yes I have a little less than half 
a terabyte at home on 4 computers, and yes I'm using more than 70% of it).

alternativly, we have a nice fast RAID 5 SCSI array here at work I'd 
take (in a larger size, this one's only about 300gb. Burst transfer is 
upwards of 250 though... :) )
