I'm with you on that thought.  I considered myself "twinked" enough when my
LV5 Halfling Druid was given 10 pp to buy his spells with.
I've never played a Wizzard before.  The only time I'd consider twinking is
if it were a class I've played far (maybe warrior, and still I'd only twink
from my other higher LV warrior who is 19).
