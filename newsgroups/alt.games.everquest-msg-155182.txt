Thats certainly an acceptable approach, but clerics don't usually
have much trouble finding a group.  I see far more chanters giving
away KEI, and yet that approach is far more damaging to their
lower level brothers.

One approach I honor more than most is a cleric asking "can you
aego my group?".   Now I'm not depriving my brother of a
livelyhood, I'm saving him an appreciable amount of mana.. he
won't have to refresh those buffs of his for a looooong time, and
his people will get hurt less (due to AC) and die less (due to
more HP) and his MA will need CHeal less often (as each CHeal will
do more hp due to the higher HP total)
