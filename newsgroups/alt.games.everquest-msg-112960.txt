I believe this is incorrect. The only time zoning inside the zone clears
the hate list, AFAIK, is when a wizard or druid does a succor / evac on
you. I gated in SK last night to save time running to the bridge to meet
somebody on the NK side (was bound on bridge at the time) and it was
definitely insta-gate. Didn't reload the zone and I'm sure I'd have
still been on any hate lists I was on previously.
