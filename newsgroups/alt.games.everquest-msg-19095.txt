Enchanter is not a class for soloing (Not that they are not soloable, but they
shine most in groups =D). If you considered yourself as a bad enchanter, the
only way to solve that is not avoiding groups but instead join more groups to
practice your skills. If you don't work on that now, you will suffer more later.
Few deathes at lv16 is really nothing. But you are going to ruin everyone else
when you get them killed at Lv30+ because of your bad grouping skills. Just my
humble advice. =)
