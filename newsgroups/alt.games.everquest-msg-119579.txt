Once upon a time, on a previous account, I tied my sense
heading to my left turn arrow key, so that my little ranger
raised his sense heading skill without the pain of constantly
pressing a button which almost never returns useful
information.

On my current account, my main is a Dwarven cleric,
which means he started with a 50 skill.. since it was
never worthless (unreliable, yes) he'd use it as a navigation
tool often enough for the skill to raise naturally.

My druid and beastlord bought compass's and refuse
to use the muddy Sense Heading, they just sacrificed
an inventory slot to an actual 100% reliable direction
indicator.

But my bard, now, is another story.  With some effort
(which is to say while practicing bind wounds) I've managed
over the past 28 levels to get the skill to a stunning (7)

I really really can't afford the inventory slot or hotkey space
for a compass, I already have 2 weapons slots and four
open inventory slots in hotkey spaces.  So here I am,
stuck with clouds or dropped weapons to use to steer
my tall tall ship.
