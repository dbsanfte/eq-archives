I have been trying different areas, do`nt remember all the details now,
but I seem to have problems most places except Grater Faydark and 
surrounding zones. I am playing a Wood Elf Druid and High Elf Paladin
there without much problem. It is the weirdest thing though a flash of
lightening there can cause it too!.

No problem there, I have 50% of a 40Gb HD empty.

I have had the colour resolution from 32bit ( True Colour ) down
to 256 colours and tried 640 x 480.
I have the clip plane set to minimum but have`nt tried turning
off the mip mapping ( was`nt sure what that did! :-) )

The vendor who sold me the computer is totally baffled and it runs
games like Tales of the Sword Coast and the new Bakders Gate II
with absolutely no problems.

I had planned to get a broadband cable connection anyway and that
is being done on Friday. If that does`nt improve things I will try
replacing the on board video with a graphics card, I have a Diamond
Viper 550 lying around the place somewhere. 

Thanks for your reply.

Percy Oyston.
