Unless you happen to be an Iksar, handing in your note will only result in
minor faction, minor exp, and a newbie tunic which is less than crappy.  If
you are an Iksar, your note results in a newbie weapon which becomes a part
of chain quests which leads into some of the Armor Quests.  If this is the
case, there is a redemption quest in Cabilis which will result in your
newbie weapon.
