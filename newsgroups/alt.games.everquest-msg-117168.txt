Years ago, I was on a multiplayer online dungeon game where
character death was *permanent* -- if you died, you lost
everything and had to start all over.

To announce a character's passing, the game would send
a systemwide message saying:
   "<character-name> bought the farm"

So I waited until a lot of people were online,
started a new character named "You", then purposely
killed him off...

Once I confessed, about a dozen people told me they
had nearly had heart attacks.
