If you can find a Velium Scimitar, buy it or get it from someone much higher
by some carefully placed compliments (ie begging). It's a good weapon; but
realize that you won't be using weapons much past 20.

Can't help you here ... ditched my 1hb club as soon as I got my first rusty
scim.

you'll never be as good a tank as a monk, nor as good a healer as a cleric.
What you do excel at is speed buffs, damage shields, and root/snaring. We
druids
are the kite masters. If you SoW your tank, and can snare the MoB, everybody
in the group wins. If you group doesn't  let you med, get another group.

don't bother with conjugation; your english is fine ... just kidding.
Frankly,
my halfling druid put a few points in sense heading, forage, and evoc at the
start and I'm not sure I've done much with them since. Practice foraging A
LOT,
when you get to 14, you can go to LavaStorm and not have to leave to find
a vendor with food. I did level 14 to 19 in LavaStorm in 10 days of casual
playing
without leaving once for food. Most times I was leaving to sell loot.
