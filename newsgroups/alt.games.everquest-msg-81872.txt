That is what the potion says I know.  The last patch gives use
levels or some such, and in guild chat it was said that the potions
state lvl 60 as recommended level. I had to log and did not get to
find out if  they would still work for them (the person was level 56
I think).

Myself I am still mad that I could put GEB's on my Iksar Necro the
other day and after the last patch I can't.  Like 5ac more is a big
advantage to an Iksar Necro.  I sure as hell don't want to mele.
And the worst part is what will I put on my feet now ;-).
