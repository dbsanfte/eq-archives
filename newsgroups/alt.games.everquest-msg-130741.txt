I haven't watched Sesame Street since the early 80's. What kind of loser 
humanoid still watches that show when they're past 5 years of age?

I THINK I watched this episode, since I think it came on in the early 80's, 
or I may have heard so many years of hype about it that I've fooled myself 
into remembering watching it. But... as a little kid watching that show, I 
always hoped somebody else would see Snufflauphagus. And every episode they 
would tease it, and not deliver. That was so frustrating. It's good to know 
they finally did let other people see Snufflauphagus though, because at 
least they had a payoff to that storyline. 

I don't know WHAT they're thinking these days. That red Elmo puppet, and 
now a puppet with AIDS? Are they trying to tell kids it's the cool thing to 
do to get AIDS?
