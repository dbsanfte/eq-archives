This morning I ran the log for my baby necro through Joe D's log
analyzer for the first time, primarily to take a look at the specific
factions I was raising and trashing.  It took a minute for me to figure
out what looked odd, but here it is:

For all of the primary factions that I'd been hitting, I had a bunch
with a name I expected to see, and three for *similar* but not quite the
same names. Example,
Raised KnightsOfTruth 308 times
Raised Knights of Truth 3 time
Raised AshenOrder 308 times
Raised Ashen Order 3 times
Lowered SoldiersOfTunare 98 times
Lowered Soldiers of Tunare 3 times
Lowered ClericsOfTunare 98 times
Lowered Clerics of Tunare 3 times
etc.

These obviously came from different mobs in some cases. I have ganked
almost every orc pawn that's crosses my path since day one in the
commons to ensure I could continue to bank in North FP. (By the way, in
case you're wondering, somewhere below 308 bumps will take you from
dubious to apprehensive with the KoT and Ashen Order.) I've been hunting
the Sisters in OoT the last couple days (darn alluring sirens are always
camped) so that's accounting for all my Tunare hits. 

In trying to figure out where these odd hits and/or name changes came
from, I know that I killed *mostly* orc pawns for my KoT faction, but I
have gotten the occasional Orc Centurian that was wandering away from
their camp. And in OoT, while it's been almost all sisters, there is a
named sister that conned yellow to me (Forget her name... treebark or
something) and I got her a couple of times. I didn't think either of
those cases were exactly three times, but who knows.

So what's up? Did I really get a different faction of a handful of odd
mobs? Or was there a recent change in the naming convention of all the
factions during a patch? Are the oddball ones doing me any good/harm as
far as my faction with the groups in question?
