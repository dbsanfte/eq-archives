Been making my own kill points and if you 2 box it is easy.

Make a toon of anytype doesn't matter level them to 6 and park them in a
safe area out of the way

Make a bard which you can level to 6 in under an hour, then run over to your
first toon and kill the bard

Repeat as necessary, I am working on killing myself into history and never
leaving the city.

Here we have just one more example of SoE not thinking thru something before
making it live. This is an obvious flaw in their design and they didn't even
see it coming what a bunch of pathetic designers.
