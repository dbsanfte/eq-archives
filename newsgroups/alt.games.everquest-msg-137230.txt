Yes, I call you a bigot.  I think worse of you.  Your tap-dancing
aside, lets move on:

So by the above statements, its "possible" for a gay man to abuse a
boy, and you do not say heterosexuals don't molest children of the
same gender.  So then, what's your point?  By your statements above
there is no guarantee that a child won't be molested regardless of the
gender of the mentor.  So, by extension, you agree that barring gay
men from being mentor to boys is pointless exercise if sexual abuse is
your concern.

So you try to use an article to prove that the "the homosexual
lifestyle is not being
forced on people" and failed.  Then you pretended your point was
"obviously" something else, but this time not only did you fail to
defend you point, you didn't even have a point!

> Answer the question, BS....

I did.  Why don't YOU?

> Why do mentoring programs have the rule that males will only mentor
> men and women will only mentor women..

Because they naively think that makes the kids safer.  Some may even
link being gay to being a pedophile, like the RC church has tried to.

> And why don't those rules apply to those in the homosexual
lifestyle??

Two comments:
(1) there is no "homosexual lifestyle" except in what passes for your
mind
(2) they ARE applying the same rule: men mentor boys, women mentor
girls.


> You are in a special lifestyle so you get SPECIAL rights..

Nothing all that special about my lifestyle, and there are no special
rights, as I proves to you before.

How much more pathetic do you want to look, EQ?  Your attempts to
side-track are really transparent.   Can't you ever directly reply to
anything?
