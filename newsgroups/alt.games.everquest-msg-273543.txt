Did rare resources get increased in the drop tables? 

I was doing the dwarven boot quest part 1 and harvesting all the nodes
to get the iron and wood to spawn in Antonica. In two days I gathered
1 coral, 1 silver, 2 severed bones, 1 nonsullied hide and 3 sisal
roots. Nothing like that has ever happened in this way before.

Was I just very lucky or did the resource tables change?
