Hail,

This lvl52 monk is equiped with sc handwraps, ROLC, peacebringer and
other other stuff on that grade. With all the equipment I have only 1.5
ton for loots until the AC penalty is taken.
I do have a 100% wr bag and a ralic pack(85%)

The question is where to farm for pp.  The only place I know of is CC
geos where they drop gem which makes me about 200pp/hr.

Any ideas will be much appreciated.   I hunt mostly in downtime so the
spawns are widly available but hard to find a group.

Thanks.
