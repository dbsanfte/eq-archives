Read it, and dismissed it as irreleavent and pointless to the discussion.
The analogy does not apply as we are not discussing morals and laws
and their application in the real world. Verant made the rule, if they made the
rule what was their reason for it?

The logic is that it violates the rules. You may 'feel' that reporting the name
was not appropriate, but the only one that can determine whether it was

Opinion noted, obviously we disagree. So lets have a GM decide if the name
is a miniscule violation or not. Ok?
