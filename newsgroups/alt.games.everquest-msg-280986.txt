I put sense traps and disarm traps on automatic (tied them to my left 
and right turn arrows) and ignored them, recently I noticed that I had a 
skill substantially higher than the old limit for bard skill in disarm 
(122... and I think its still going up)

A poster in another thread mentioned that Pick Lock skill is now given 
to bards at level 10... I thought I couldn't use it till 40 so I haven't 
bothered even trying to raise it yet.  They also mention having a 100 
skill... best I knew was that a bard could only get it to 100: an almost 
useless skill level.

Soooo, I tried looking around on the web, but with my limited surfing 
skills (slow in the bathtub) I could only find stuff from 2003, nothing 
at all about the changes.

Castersrealm seems to have only the old skill set, so thats no help 
either.

And asking in OOC or in the general or bard channels gets no information 
at all, leading me to suspect this is a bug and everyone is trying to 
keep quiet about it since it actually makes those skills potentially 
useful, till SOE finds out about it.
