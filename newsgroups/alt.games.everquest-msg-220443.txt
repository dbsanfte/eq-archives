I don't think I;m as anti-LDoN as you are.  I will admit that I have
had a lot of fun with it.  The 2 biggest problems in my eyes are the
disconnect between the dungeons and rest of the world.

It would have been better, IMHO, to make a "Rujarkian Hills" zone,
accesible through the Orc Highway or so, and then have a separate
entrance for each dungeon in that zone, as well as the Adventurer's
camp. Have a zone *riddled* with entrances.

This way, there is at least still some sense of a "world".  As it is,
entering one of 10 vaguely similar dungeons through the same quicksand
pit does little for me.

Also, a little more variety in the dungeons would have been
appreciated.  A lot of them seem to suffer fell like they were created
with the Daggerfall random dungeon generator -> " Room X turned 90%
door in position 1, 3, & 4, and hall type B leading to next room"
There's a whole lot of cookie cutter design in the dungeons.

I'd be intertested to hear whatyou think the problems with the way
they implemented instancing are, though.
