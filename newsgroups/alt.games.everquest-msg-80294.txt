After putting a bunch of points in feign death at 17 , the only thing you
should be saving up skill points for is flying kick. It's a really slow
skill to raise cause it has a very long delay. Don't let that delay put you
off though, I frequently flying kick for over 100, and my best thunderkick
so far has been 178. Put as many points into flying kick when you first get
it as you can, depending on points left and cost. It will be worth it.

All other melee skills , just put one point in them to start them off and
they will go up fast enough.
