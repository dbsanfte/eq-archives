Well, I'd probly keep plaing, I reckon.  I never seem to get much higher
than levle 12 anyway, so starting from scraych and getting back to where I
am now would take about a week.  Course, I can't speak for people waaaaay up
there with you lot, but it's the fun of the game more than anything else,
ins't it?  I keep thinking I should switch to Fironia Vie anyway, becasue
it's the roleplaying I enjoy the most, not what level I'm at.  It gives me a
chance to play a grmpy dark elf and indulge my feelings like I'm not allowed
to at work.

Blimey.  That's a loit of spelling mistakes.  And I called somebody ELSE
Molesworth...  :O)   sORRy, Molesworth, whoever you were.  Actually, I
thought I'd corrected most of them.  You'll have to excuse me - it's been a
difficult shift today and I am now very drunk indeed.
