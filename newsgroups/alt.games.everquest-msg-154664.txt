The spirit of Darwinism as we joke about it involves the punishment
for the lack of the appropriate level of common sense. You should know
better than to eat eggs from a carton with and expiration date of a
month prior. However, if someone took two-month-old eggs and stamped
tomorrow's date on them, how can that be considered Darwinism for you
to eat them? Same holds true for a child who dies by misusing a
particular toy. How could they possibly know better? They're still
just little drooling poop-machines who rely more on reflex and
instinct than conventional wisdom.

Have plenty of it, thanks. Celebrating the death of a child just
happens to be one of my hot buttons. Maybe you just need to grow a
little sensitivity.

Snide remarks = your opinions typically falling upon deaf ears.
