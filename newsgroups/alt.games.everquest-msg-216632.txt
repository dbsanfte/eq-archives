65/normal mobs are WAY easier than tier 3 PoP.  They are as hard as
typical Tier 1 PoP mobs (think Gobbies in PoN).  I'm a robe with no
ac, no aa for damage mitigation and a tendency to be sitting when a
roamer adds.  As a result I get hit for full damage several times an
adventure - the most I've seen them hit for is 370.  Compare to tier
2 PoP (Golems, Fiends in PoV) at 566 and they aren't even close.
