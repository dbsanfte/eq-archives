Find out what pages you need.  Buy the research book (I forget the name of
it...NOT Concordance of Research, that's the practice book).  If you need a
spell made carry the pages and the tome (Tome of Endless Enchantments?) with
you at all times, keeping an eye out for a high level enchanter in your
zone.  If you politely request and let them know that you have the page and
the tome with you, there's a very good chance they'll hit Combine for you.

At least, I do.

BTW, you can buy some research-only spells in Katta Castellum on the moon.
I don't happen to know if Mesmerization is, sorry.
