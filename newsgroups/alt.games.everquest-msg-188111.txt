    You've fallen victim to the "corporate website design" syndrome, whereby
the everquest.com site, like all corporate websites, does its absolute best
to obscure any useful information they might be forced to put up by burying
it in the html equivalent of pigshit. Pretty pictures, animations, artistic
multi level menu systems, words put up as picture files so you can't
actually search for anything on the page, etc. If you ever do find actual
information, it's for shareholders not people actually trying to buy their
products or services.

    A bit like this post really, I don't have any up to date information for
you. I can say it's something like $12 or $14 US a month (I pay in
australian dollars so I really haven't a clue but it's somewhere in that
range) and that I got my first month free after downloading everquest (with
no expansions) also free of charge. So I actually played the game for 30
days for absolutely nothing before i started paying for it. Of course after
that time period I was heavily hooked on the game, and not only quite happy
to pay the negligible monthly fee (having added up the hours I'd played in a
single month I calculated that it was the cheapest entertainment I'd see all
year) but also looking towards buying those expansions.

    Having said that I think trying to swing 30 days free and downloading
the original version for nix is the way to go, or else if you have to pay
for just one month. You might find you detest the game.

Cheers,
James
