Heh, in general, I would.  But I find that my operating system choice is 
generally determined by what software I want to run, rather than the other 
way around.  

So... when's EQ for linux coming out?  Sigh.

The real bitch, though, is the big batch of programs I -need- for work 
that have never been ported to a non-VMS platform.  Double sigh.
