Well, like most anything about this game, the real answer is, It
Depends.

For the sake of argument, we'll assume you're a nontwink and on a
budget. (If you're a twink with lots of cash on hand, the answer is
easy.  Mith 2hander, Mace of Shadowed Souls, Clay Guardian Shield, and
Darkforge/Ry'gor armor, whichever suits you better)

If you're a large race (troll, ogre) SK, at this point, you'd probably
be best off putting all your cash into a good 2handed weapon, and
spend what you have left on the best armor you can affoard.  And by
"best", remember, AC is god.  For the most part, stats are
meaningless, as long as your Agil is above 75 and you have the Str to
carry your equipment.  Intelligence isn't too big an issue for you at
the moment, as it's startlingly easy to get into the 100+ range intel
even on a large race without trying too much.  Long story short, pick
up a Nathar Greatsword (around 400-500 plat on Fennin), spend the rest
on what Fine Steel bits you can pick up.  If you dont' have that kind
of cash, the Runic Carver and Axe of the Iron Back make decent 2
handers.

If you're a small race, you'll want to make up for the lack of Slam by
using a sheild and the Bash skill.  In that case, pick up a Coldain
shield for about 40 plat in Thurgadin, and spend the rest on a high
powered one hander.  The Crystalized Sword from the Crystal Caverns is
a very good choice for this.

In any case, no matter what race you are, make sure you have yourself
a cheap, magical 1hb weapon to keep that skill up.  The Mace of
Shadowed Souls will only be getting cheaper in price as time goes on,
and Luclin could very easily put this weapon into the sub-1k range.
