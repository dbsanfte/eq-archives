The /autojoin sets your autojoin channels to whatever you list after it.  
By putting the , after it, you are setting it to no channels.  If you 
list any channels, you will simply be making those your autojoin 
channels.

As for editting the files, there is an .ini file for each character, you 
likely have the autojoin list in that file for the character in question, 
and you can remove your autojoins by editting that file.
