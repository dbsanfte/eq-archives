have a 20th level warrior and monk, and their massive hitting weapons went
up significantly to where they are hitting in the 50's.  damage cap was very
very noticable and was really glad when 20th hit that they started hitting
harder.  One uses a adamantine Bo which is 17 30, the other has several hard
hitting 2hs weapons.  actually my warrior has more weapons than he could
ever possibly use, really need to sell some of them off.  If your using a
weapon that should be hitting better and aren't, then maybe your class /
race is broken.
