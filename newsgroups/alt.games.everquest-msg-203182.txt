I enjoying soloing or playing with my life partner as well as my EQ partner.
We are both in a guild and like grouping with guildmates when we have the
time. But it usually does take a long time to get it together. Now on a
weekend when we might be on for four hours that's fine. But on a week night,
because of our work schedule, we may only have an hour or two. By the time
everyone assembles and gets to our destination then it's time to log.  Since
finding KEI we've found we are able to get more accomplished in a short
evening thus making our EQ adventuring more enjoyable.  We finally did get
our mains up to 52, but without a faster maga regen below those levels we
might not have played as much or even quit altogether.  Sitting in spot
doing nothing is just plain boring sometimes. I see no reason for it except
for SOE to get more money from it's players. I think the challenge to the
game should focus on how to pull, what spells to use when fighting,
adventuring and questing   and NOT doing nothing for long stretches at a
time.  I know I'll see responses saying I'm not managing my mana properly if
I sit for long periods of time. That may be true in a larger group but in a
two person group or soloing that's just not true.  I have to agree with the
first poster, I'd like to see a faster mana regen rate for all or at least
spells equivalent to hp healing spells (other than twitch).  I think first
and foremost SOE should try to make the game enjoyable for all types of
players.  My two cents.
