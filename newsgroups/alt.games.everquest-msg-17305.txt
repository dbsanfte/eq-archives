I would say thay playing my de necro has been easyer than my human
counterpart in qeynos, i got killed about 3 minutes after i entered
qeynos for the first time, at least in neriak you are safe :)
My DE has been in freeport with no big worries, stay out of the north
side though, got killed by a sentinel there, and you can't trade at
the merchants except for the necro guild in town (to my knowledge that
is)

Good weapon i guess is a matter of preference, my necro uses a 2H
blunt and likes the damage it causes :))
