I played eq from the beginning of 2000 until WOW came out, and have been 
playing WOW since.
I dont buy the argument that WOW players are less (or more) mature than eq 
players.

Even if it were true, it doesnt matter. You join up with a guild with people 
who suit your own maturity.
Dont like your guild? Join another. Theres plenty of mature and nice guilds 
out there. Im in one.

I dont know if EQ is conducive to returning to. Ive hear that quite a lot 
has been done in the almost 2 years since I left to make the game more 
accessible to people unable to find their way into large raiding guilds. Im 
not sure if I believe it.

In my opinion EQ's biggest failure was the locking of most of its zones, and 
the heavy requirements to get into those zones. It was pointless applying to 
many higher level raiding guilds regardless of how serious you were, because 
you were unflagged for their content, and they would sooner recruit someone 
who already had these "flags", and you cant blame them with not wanting to 
be continually backflagging people.

In WOW the content you are doing is determined by your own gear and 
abilities and how much you want to push the limit. Getting keyes isnt the 
issue, its the difficulty of the fight. Im in a very high level raiding 
guild in WOW and people come and go, but we dont need to worry about people 
being flagged. That is a requirement, but its not a showstopper for them if 
they arnt because getting flagged for any end game instance isnt a major 
obstacle like EQ.

In other words you can start at the bottom and work up without having to 
guildhop, or without having to know the right people or get favors.

My advice would be to hop on the next WOW server that opens, start from 
level 1 with everyone else and try ad level up fast, and get yourself in a 
decent raiding guild from the beginning. If it doesnt work out at least your 
have gear and experience and be able to make a sideways shift.

Stay away from EQ. It is a dying game and designed to prevent you from 
playing catchup. From the comments I read on various forums, it wouldnt 
surprise me if EQ isnt around in a few years by the amount of people still 
leaving the game. Same could be said for several other SOE games.
