Ah, the only time I ever tested this was in beta and it did in fact work 
then after 72 hours. Haven't had a lost shard in retail and I don't see any 
reason why they'd change this feature (although it wouldn't surprise me much 
if they had). Maybe you're bugged in some other way, /bug it and post in the 
forums so they know it's happening if it is a bug. As others have pointed 
out, you can also right click on the door of an instanced zone (like 
Firemyst) and choose Recover Shard. This might also work for other dungeons 
but it was specifically added for the case where you couldn't re-create the 
lost instance or couldn't go back in during a lockout period and thus needed 
a way to recover your shard.
