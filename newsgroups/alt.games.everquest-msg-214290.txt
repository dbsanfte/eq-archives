Check on the server select screen.  I think I saw a button called "Update 
Subscribed Expansions" or something like that.  It's supposed to take you 
to a screen that lets you pay for expansions.  It worked for me to get 
LDoN.  

That was yesterday though, it might be changed now.  I heard if you're an 
Ubisoft customer it's different too.  Good luck.
