When I started trading in EC Crafted pauldrons were about 350pp Boots were
400 and the BP was 1k plus (got a mine cheap at 800) This was summer 2000 so
the game had been around for some time. Crafted is now very cheap compared
and you are seeing this. The bracer quest will cost you around 100pp in
gems, you can pick a crafted bracer up for 50pp or so, nowadays.

The quest is old and now the reward doesn't look as good. The same has
happened to Kunark weapons and armour and will prolly to some of the Velious
items.
