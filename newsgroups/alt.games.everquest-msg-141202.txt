I have same card as you - and 500mb RAM with a 1.5 ghz processor. My brother
has the same setup. My other half has the same - but less RAM cuz he had one
piece die on him and hasn't gotten around the replacing. My brother and I
play fine - other half has all sorts of RAM issues. Upshot of this? GO the
RAM! :) You'll notice the difference immediately...
