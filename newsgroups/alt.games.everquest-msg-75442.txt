The latest nvidia drivers (23.11)  have never worked, at least not for
me in Win2000/XP. You get dropped. It's a DirectX 8.1 issue actually,
because I have serious choppiness  in all my other games that use 8.1,
that I didnt have before when I was using 21.83 and DirectX 8.0. I had
to go back to 21.83, no problems at all in any of my DirectX games
yet. Verant is full of shit when they tell you EQ works with the
latest Detonator drivers.

The problem of being sure exactly who should fix it is beyond me. Both
DirectX and the Detonator drivers have different versions depending if
you use 2000/XP, or 98/ME. I don't know if the problem is confined to
a particular version of Windows. But I do know you can probably
install the 21.83 drivers (or older) and the problem should go away.
