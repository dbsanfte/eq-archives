This is what happens when you try to use a spreadsheet when you need a
database.Your best solution would be to export your data to a database
product like Microsoft Access (since you mention you have Office 2k.)

Then, you can do a simple query along the lines of:

SELECT Flavor, OrderCount Count(*) FROM tbOrder GROUP BY Flavor
