I got on, and transfered three lowbie alts.

Interesting fact:

The MOTD on legends states "if your characters havent been transfered
yet the automatic script that does it runs every our but wont work if
you're online."

Hmmmm. So, let me get this straight: The character transfer is so simple
its left to an automated script that just needs account name, source
server, source character, and destination server.


But they charge 50 bucks for this?

At least when I beleived it took some human time I thought it might be
halfway justified....

Second interesting observation:

Shar Vahl at least is currently populated almost entirkely by level 1
and 2 kitties naked. All seem very friendly and "in character" so far.

Cant see many other twinks out there yet, but I'll let y'all know the
server makeup when I get to explore properly tonight.
