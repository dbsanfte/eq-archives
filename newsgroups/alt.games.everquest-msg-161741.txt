We have ELP system, Event Lotto Points

We set all possible raid encounters with a lvl of elps earned on successful
raid.

Raid is defined as needing 2-3 groups to complete a specific goal. Amount of
points is dependent on the raid.

E.g. Trakanon. Used to be 2 points earned for successful raid. Dragon is now
easy encounter so only earns 1 point.

NToV is on the other end of raid spectrum. You have to spend a lot of time
clearing so we award 4 points for total raid time of clearing flurries and
named drakes then award 3 points per named dragon downed. Raid logs then
taken into account of when people turned up, if they turn up half way
through they don't earn so many points etc.

When loot drops you bid points earned against other guild members. Bidding
is done sensibly but you can bid for any item that is usable by your class
and is an upgrade. Some known items are reserved for classes with a minimum
rate. e.g. Nice bow drops off Doomshade, this was limited to rangers only
bidding with minimum of 25elps.

This sytem means that those that raid most and therefore support the guild
most become better equipped quicker and make encouners that bit easier. No
point in a Warlord gaining a 60AC breastplate if he raids once a month
rather than Warlord who is MA everyday.

Droppable loot is property of the guild, if you upgrade an item you won on
elps with a new item won on elps that item is then given back to guild bank
for others to bid on with a refund of half the elps you originally spent.
Selling loot earned via guild raids is deguild offence.

Points systems take a lot of administration work by officers but is
generally very fair system.

Spells are awarded to the person who needs it with the most active raid
history.

E.g. Greater remove curse drops. 3 druids require it, one druid has done 150
raids this year one has done 120 raids one has done 30 raids. Makes sense it
goes to the most active druid as it benefits future guild raids.
