Back in the Village
Find this song on Sheet music, CD
(Smith/Dickinson)
Turn the spotlights on the people
Sitch the dial and eat the worm
Take your chances, kill the engine
Drop your bombs and let it burn

White flags shot to ribbons,
The truce in black and burned.
Shellshock in the kitchen.
Tables overturned

Chorus:
Back in the village again
In the village,
I'm back in the village again.

Throwing dice now, rolling loaded
I see sixes all the way,
In a black hole and I'm spinning
As my wings get shot away.

No breaks on the inside,
Paper cats and burning barns,
There's fox among the chickens,
And a killer in the hounds.

Questions are a burden
And answers are a prison for oneself
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn.

Chorus:
But still we walk into the valley
And others try to kill the inner flame
We're burning brighter and before
I don't have a number, I'M A NAME!

Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
Back in the village again
In the village

I'm back in the village
Back in the village
Back in the village again.
