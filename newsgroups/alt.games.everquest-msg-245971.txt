Ignoring mez breaks for the moment, I've never had a problem with AoE
(Rain) spells in LDoN and I probably cast one on 90% of the mobs in
any given adventure.  The same goes for a druid I group with on a
regular basis. I have a few times not been paying attention, caught
one of those non-agro NPCs in a rain and spawn a couple of extra mobs
but that's not really a big deal. 

... although I guess with a druid, he has the potential to cast other
AoE spells that have a bigger radius and might cause agro problems. .
I can't see anyone using those in LDoN though. 

Rgds, Frank
