Hi Again;

     I decided I wanted to get the stuff from the tutorial so I made a new
toon, did the tutorial thru lev 4 I think, then transferred my stuff from my
other toon to the new one.

  I have to redo the quests but thats not a big deal..I'll kill stuff then
go back when I get my warder unless I feel like hitting the bugs again
later..I have 4 carapaces and 2 mandibles right now.

     Take care and Travel Safe;
                    Sherri
