Interesting question. I find it hard to be objective in that I have not
played every class. I am pondering how an enchanter could keep your day
messed up til he could kill you....laugh if u will, but if played right, you
may get very little chance to do much of anything ('cept maybe an occasional
drool, or baby sound) hehe. He could debuff you while mezzed, lower your MR,
drain your mana, slow you, drop your int and wis. Then spin you or stun you
to break the mezz, while he drops his dot or baby nuke on you. Then mezz
again. Be fun to try. I've only done one such combat, and I won niftily, but
I think the other guy really didn;t know what to do.
