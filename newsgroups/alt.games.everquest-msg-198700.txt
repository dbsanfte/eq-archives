Or play a bard and do both, still think its the most effective PvP
char out there. High  MR + charm + speed + Hi AC + well you get the
idea, fortunatly its not an easy char to play and comes into its own a
bit later than some. Casters have hell with a well equiped bard (MR
over 300 not hard and either fire/cold or poison/disease can be very
high too) , and after about level 40 getting all those mind and HP
buffs stripped in about 5 ticks really sucks. Plus if a bard goes PK
he can kill you without you even knowing hes there. (now where did
that mob come from?) But again not every ones favorite char to play.
My suggestion for a 3 person group:
Bard
Cleric
SK
Gives good PvP and xp potential. All 3 are plate classes and all have
different strengths.
