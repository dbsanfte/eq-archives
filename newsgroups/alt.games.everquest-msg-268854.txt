One of my volunteers is from Beijing (a native
mandarin speaker) and she very nearly tears her
hair out over english pronunciation.  What makes
it worse is, in Portland we have a number of streets
named for historic figures -- and they pronounced
their names a bit differently:

IE:  The street just north of Burnsided is spell "Couch"
however, it is pronounced "Cooch".

Xing "But why is this 'cooch' and that 'cow-tch'?  they
are spelled the same!"
Me "Umm, because it's someone's name, and they get to
pronounce it anyway they like?"
Xing - HUGE eye roll.
