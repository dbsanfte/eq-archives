The Torch of Alna will make the fire pet a much better tank because of the
hp boost, but if you don't have it you'll probably spend several hours doing
the quest from start to finish.  Getting the torch to drop from the
magicians in Najena was my bottleneck.  If you're on a server where you
don't have a patron or rich older character, as I think is your situation, I
would imagine the plat to buy the fire opal (think that's the one required
for the torch) would be a difficult proposition, too.  If I hadn't had any
of the focus items, I probably would have relied on the water pet like I did
up to 39.
