Actually by late pop and later their ability to pull is virtually nil
due to harmony's resist rate and rangers don't have the mitigation to
be effective in tanking many of the high dps mobs they were trying to
harmony in the first place. Not to mention its outdoor only.

Except dps is all rangers have... and its not high enough.

Apparently devs may be agreeing with me now, melee dps is back on
their "we're looking at it" list for rangers, especially now that
they've KOed any chance of an archery boost.
