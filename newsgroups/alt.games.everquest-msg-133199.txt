I believe I can speak to this question with some authority :) I play(ed) AC
on the Harvestgain server for a long time. I switched over to Vallon Zek, a
Team PvP server. I would NOT reccomend a PvP server for you unless you have
friends ( as I did ) that will help you learn how to play the game. Any of
the Blue servers would be good. I cant speak as to specifics on that part,
as Ive only ever played on Vallon or Firiona Vei. IF you can abide by the
ruleset for Firiona Vei, I would HIGHLY reccomend that server. Never met a
single player on that server that wasnt a nice guy.

As to characters and classes, well I would suggest playing one of the "solo"
classes at least until youve gotten a feel for the game. I started a Druid,
and Im still VERY happy with her. Solo classes in my ( limited ) experience
are Druids, Mages, Wizzards, Necromancers, Shamans, and to a lesser extent
Rangers, Paladins, and Bards.  ( For all you EQ Old timers out there rolling
your eyes, please understand that Im an EQ Newbie myself ) I would suggest
starting out a "Good" race, as you will have less problems with Faction.
Faction is a WONDERFULL system that is completely foreign to an AC player.
It basically decides how the various NPC's will react to you. Faction is
determined by your Race, Diety, and to a large extent your actions. The
"good" races include High Elf, Wod Elf, Human(?), Gnome(?), Hafling, and
Dwarf, I think :)

While EQ is a class base system, you really need to pay attention to your
skills that you have in each class. At would HIGHLY reccomend that you
resist the temptation to be powerlevelled in the begining. There are basic
mechanics that you will need to learn, and Powerlevelleing bypasses that.
Also, Powerlevelled character, in my experience, REALLY Lag in thier skills,
as they have not been exercising those skills much if at all. Once youve got
a handle on the game and how it works that can be overcome, but in the
beggining it could really hurt you. Another suggestion, be prepared for a
lot more Down time than in AC. Whether your meditating to regain your mana,
or sitting on your keester as a melee type regenearting hit points, you will
have down time when you solo. I would seriously reccomend that you learn and
understand the various strengths and weakness's of your character befoer you
try to group. Grouping can be GREAT fun, IF you know your role, and play to
it.

A word about death here. Learn how NOT to die if at all possible ;) the
Death penaltiers post level 11 in EQ are very harsh compared to death in AC.
If your at all like me youll have to learn how to play/hunt a lot more
conservatively ;)

ALSO... please be aware that EQ, and its GM's will NOT tolerate that abuses
that the AC Devs/MS tolerate in AC. Macroing is a HUGE nono and can get you
banned. Kill stealing is a warnable offense, as is other Grief play.  All in
all I feel that it really contributes to a better play atmosphere. EQ has a
"Play Nice Policy" that I am glad to say is actually enforced.

That being said though I have NOT experienced the "Gestapo" tactics that are
attributed to Verant. The only time I have had to deal with a GM is when I
thought that my corpse had been lost, and Im happy to say it was a pleasent
experience.

All in all I think that your in for a great time. EQ is VERY different from
AC, and different in ways that I find very enjoyable.
