Heck, for necro/mage you don't even twink that much.

for a mage, buy the components for the pet focus item
quests.  They work on the low level pets, they just don't 
show the physical differences you see after 34.

For either class, I'd pick 2 of the +25cha steins and
then enlist a 55+mage to coth me to the T-boot vendor
in Sol-A.  Speed always helps, but even more for soloing
with pets (you can more easily park the pet and pull
to him).

For both classes I'd pick up decent HP/AC gear.  I twinked
a 'bot enchanter about 9 months ago and achieved +350 or
+400 hp, decent ac for a cloth class and some extra mana/
int for under 2k.

Then, just find a 61+ mage to summon a few belts of Magi'Kot
(Girdles are better, but they are 64 or 65 level spell).  They
add 250 hp to your pet (500 for the girdle).  And I'd imagine
a mage would be happy to sell you several, along with summoned
weapons with +50hp per, in summoned 10 slot bags for pretty
cheap.  If you have some left at the end of a play session, just
duel die to hang onto them.  Mages won't be extortionate about
prices, as they don't usually have buyers for this sort of stuff.
Group your bard with him  during the summoning so he can get
the mana regen.

Add in a budget for KEI and you're styling.  Of course, the first
50 levels will be absurdly easy, making 51 seem even *WORSE* than
it does now.
