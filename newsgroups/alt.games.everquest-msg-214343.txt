With my ranger i tended to aim for fights with animal based creatures, so
snare and panic animal were the 2 spells i used mostly. This makes the
animal turn and walk away (like fear) while you chop away at it or practice
with your bow. This was a good way to raise money at the time as players
were buying the skins / pelts etc from me. With non animal based mobs i was
using snare to pull, rooting the mob and using my bow.
Now in groups and raids i use my bow 90 percent of the time, so you should
keep practicing with yours. I was fortunate enough to get hold of a velium
bow early on in my adventures, the nice damage to delay ratio along with no
level restriction makes it ideal for low rangers, but they are a bit
expensive. Needless to say, i used fletching to make lots of cheap arrows to
fling around, unless you can get a kind mage to summon you some. Also the
bazaar makes this easire. there are usually lots of summoned arrows for sale
by someone, which can be cheaper than fletching them.
