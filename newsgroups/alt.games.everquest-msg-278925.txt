Personally I think its a design flaw. I don't have an issue with zones 
that have multiple personalities... e.g. a 12th level 
instance/mission/task/expedition, and a 45th level instance. That's just 
efficient use of level design coding effort, and allows players to enjoy 
a zone and come back later to enjoy it in a new fresh way.

But there's something profoundly disatisfying about zones that scale to 
my level. 

For one thing its entirely like those racing games that scale your 
opponents to your skill level. (e.g. NFS3) If you crash they all slow 
down an wait for you to catch up. There is simply no sense of real 
accomplishment or progress when fighting opponents that simply 
perpetually scale up with you.

To really drive the point home... imagine if the whole game worked like 
that: it would be EQUIVALENT to removing levelling from the game.

If mobs are always scaled to the same relative difficulty to you what 
exactly is the point of gaining a "level"? 

In EQ you start at level 1, and the newbie yard trash are an even fight, 
with some wandering yellows and even reds that require at least a small 
group to take down.. Would the game be more fun if at level 2 the newbie 
yard trash are an even fight with some wandering yellows and even reds 
that require at least a small group to take down... how about at level 
40 when the newbie yard trash are an even fight with some wandering 
yellows and even reds that require at least a small group to take 
down... 

That's progression :p

I do like the idea of a mid level zone to have an "event instanced" 
version for high levels to com. e.g. Mistmoore is 20-40 zone, but you 
can get a 70th level instanced version for the "Axis of Evil Meeting" 
where security has been really beefed up and there are some visiting 
named that drop loot unique to the instance.

A 2nd problem with zones that scale is that it undermines high level 
exploration. Lets go do splitpaw at 50 might be high level but its long 
since lost its sense of adventure. There are no new sights to see, no 
falling for traps, pits, no secret doors, no figuring out how the zone 
is laid out or where its deepest corners are etc... you found out about 
all that at level 4.

As long as its only a few zones its bearable... but if much of the 
highend game becomes retreads of what you did already people will burn 
out MUCH faster.
