ex here too.  Even if you asked someone who happened to work in the
department and are stading next to product in question, their answer
is more likely "I don't know".

It's not just clueless, they are either illiterate or lazy.  It's not
hard to pick up a product you cover in your department, read some info
on it, and memorize some of the common features.

If you asked someone in the paint area what the difference between
satin and gloss paint were, their dumb expression would give monkeys a
bad name.

If there were any single reason for me to stay employed at Walmart,
it's the 10% employee discount but I get paid a lot more elsewhere
that offsets the 10% discount :P
