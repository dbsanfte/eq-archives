I would say its a big deal. If you had killed the guards for Xï¿½, and had 
to run to zone to get out of danger, no problem.
But when you purposely start a train, you endanger newbies, can get 
everyone in the area in trouble (ever wonder why evil races stay out of 
guard reach? If a newbie troll zone in and stand outside guard reach, he 
WILL be killed when the guard return to his place).


You also shoot a little at your teammates in CS just for fun before the 
enemy show up?

And as for the "were evil guild/im DE" excuse, thats bullshit. Your 
status as "evil" char dont allow you to do all you want to bother and 
endanger other players.
Im officer of an "evil" guild myself, we primarily have 
trolls/ogres/des/ikkys. That dont mean i can just go around doing 
everything i want to endanger other people. Your guild have a 
reputation, and if enough guildies act like you did, youll soon see BIG 
problems when everyone start hating your guild. Had you been in my 
guild, you would have gotten at LEAST a warning. The only reason i see 
for you not to be kicked directly out is that you gave warning for the 
train, and then "only" endangered all people zoning in after your last 
warning, every person that could be camped there and log in after your 
warning, and every person that didnt see your warning cause of battle 
spam or other problems.
