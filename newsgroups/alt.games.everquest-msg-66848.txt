Higher than low uses HELLA memory. Its NOT the models either but more
the zone textures. Try what I did with 384 meg:

1) Turn on ALL models, then get in game and see performance (probably
crash)

2) Leave ALL models on, but this time in options set textures to LOW
and turn off dynamic lighting (with a geforce 2 and the MUCH larger
proc than mine, actually dynamic lighting is probably fine for you)

3) you should be much improved, while still seeing all models.

4) ask for a 256 meg dimm for xmas ;) I did and was VERY specific
about the type. An outlet store near me has them for like 32 bucks and
I bought one myself and asked for another just like it for xmas.

WIth my p2 400, tnt 16 meg agp dinosaur, and 384 meg ram I easily
display ALL models by having LOW textures on. Even with LOW things
look better to me than without the new models. The new models are just
very cool and they all match well with each other.

The problem is that with 384 ram my default for textures was HIGH.
Verant WAY overestimated there. Texture quality is the SINGLE biggest
memory hit, WAY more than all the models and all social animations ( I
have both loaded) A way of telling is that right now cacheman is
shoing me that at my worst memory requirement I was using all 383 meg
of system ram and 533 meg of a 700 meg min/max perm swap file with
textures set to low in EQ. When I had them set to HIGH, I used ALL of
a 900 meg perm swap file and then promptly crashed when it required
MORE memory than that. That is nearly a 400 MEG diff in virtual memory
requirement PLUS (since it did not have enough and crashed)

I also crashed with textures set to med or high, try low and you can
probably use all models and will notice very little diff in quality.

Something else, the clipping seems to be WAY out farther than it was. 
This also lags you graphically. I had mine out a quarter of an inch
and was lagged to hell then noticed I was seeing pretty far out since
the dx8 change. I moved it ALL the way in, then moved it out until I
could just see far enough in front of me. Some areas have WAY more
affect on it than others, for example in the kitty city with SO many
complex buildings it was HORRIBLE for me (but I'd probably notice a
huge performance gain with a athalon 1.4 and a geforce 64 meg when I
upgrade) 

In my case this is because its your graphics card and proc which
calculates 3d polygons and mine are quite dated. However, its your
MEMORY (system and to some extent on graphics card) which run the
textures for the most part. That is why with only 256 meg setting them
to low should give you a gain and at least more stablity.

Yes, BREASTS ARE PRIORITY, MOST OF ALL!!! 
Weird but actually I'm finding my female dark elf and wood elf (same
body model basically) to be VERY slight in that department. Meanwhile
the female barbarian and human are busting out all over. The high elf
female is actually pretty average breasted also, its her plate armor
sticking out seperately from her body which creates the illusion.
Think of it as the old time norrathian equiv of a wonder bra!
