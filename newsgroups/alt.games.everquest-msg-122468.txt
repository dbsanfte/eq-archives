Saw this yesterday, did make me laugh.

The thing I like about Verant is their blatant "We're in it for the money,
deal with it" attitude. They don't try to hide it.

Want to split characters to other accounts or to other servers? No you cant'
well, ok you can it'll cost you.
Want top customer server, sure thing, $40 a month, please
Want to be an EQ2 beta tester, better start paying the $40/mnth for Legends
then.
Want that first name changed? No way, it's your rep you live with it..ok for
$50 we'll change it for you.
Next...
We'll be resetting the Sleeper on servers for $500 and giving first months
raiding priority to the guild that stumps up the cash.

At least they are not being two faced about it.

It was pointed out a while back that to change your name all you need to do
is move to legends, create a character on your original server with same
name and then move back, you get an X in your name and the option to change
it by petitioning a GM.
This was likely being done and Verant were well aware, not being able to
control it they decided to profit from it.
