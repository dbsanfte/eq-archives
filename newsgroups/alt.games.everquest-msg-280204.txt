Badly enough to put up with SOE disconnecting your account over a minor 
mistake they made in our favor for which we disputed an authorized 
transaction to 'fix' it.

That makes no sense. 

The only REASON for them to cut their losses and move on would be to 
AVOID the UPROAR. 

It seems you agree they should have cut their losses and moved on? Why 
do you agree? If the only reason is to avoid the uproar you seem to have 
tacitly admitted that you too know there will inevitably be an uproar.

As to why there is an uproar? People don't like having their credit 
cards automatically charged when there is a 'billing error'. While its 
true we aren't paying any more than we would have been had they got it 
right the first time it still rubs a lot of people the wrong way when 
SOE just helps themselves to your cash "whenever they feel like it". 
EVEN when you OWE them the money.

Giving someone authorization to bill your credit card is not carte 
blanche to just 'charge-it' whenever they like. Even if a mistake was 
made and you owe them the money they should still seek explicit 
authorization to take more money.
