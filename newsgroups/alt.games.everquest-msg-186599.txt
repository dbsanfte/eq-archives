I have a few questions, if anyone can help out...

1. Are there UK servers? Which would be a good server to join if I am
a complete n00b and enjoy roleplaying, despise PvP (OK stop laughing,
I know, didn't I choose the right game in DAOC), and don't want to
play thousands of hours a week?


There is a new UK server Vernril Sathir (or something like that_ run in
conjunction with UBI soft. Unfortuinatly I missed the frre transfer window
whilst away travelling and did not transfer my character. I am from the UK and
have been playing on the Drinal server for the last 2 years.

2. How bad is the level treadmill? How long will it take to get to a
"sensible" level at which I can enjoy much of what the game has to
offer, and how long does it take to reach your cap?

Diffucult to answer about leveling - depends partly on Character class and how
much time you put in. Level 1-10 probably a few hours. 11-20 You should easily
manage in a week playing several hours a day. After 20 you can begin to branch
out and explore more areas and leveling remains relativly easy till you get to
50. 51 -60 is a real grind.

3. Is it easy to find good groups? (This has been a real pain in
DAoC.)

Even though I play on a US server I have always found groups most of the time.
Acually I get the best of both worlds because early in the day I get to solo
some good areas and in the afternoon or evening I can usually pick up a group.

Any other hints/tips/check out www.something.com would be greatly
appreciated. There's an EQ bundle for ï¿½25 from amazon - I was hoping
that was enough to get me started, but I vaguely recalling reading
that PoP also helps newbies due to quick travel and some new lowbie
spells...

Try http://www.eqatlas.com/atlas.html
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/
http://eq.crgaming.com/
http://www.eqtraders.com./

PoP does make a BIG difference in getting around


Anyway, many thanks!

Shrub.
