Quite clearly I ignored the parts of the message commented out in the
original html. Or something. That was probably the cause of my
ignorance, and the reason I assumed you believed the character was real.
Not quite sure what I was 'accusing' you of though, other than falling
for a fairly obvious fake e-bay sale.

would be nice spam if you were selling it>

<! Of course, the character doesn't exist so isn't on any server and
doesn't have any name, so releasing that false information might've been
a mistake had the character had existed and the server information been
legit. Which of course they aren't, and I'm not suggesting they are >

(! Which of course they don't, because made-up magelo profiles don't run
around, which I knew all along, but if he did exist and if he did have
that profile and if that was his name, then he would have the IQ of a
doorknob. Probably highest than his guild however, if they awarded him
all that stuff. If he had a guild. Because he doesn't. Because it's
fake. Obviously.>

C'mon, admit it - You fell for a troll ):oP
