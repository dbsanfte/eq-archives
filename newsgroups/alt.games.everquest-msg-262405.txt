Hi All,

I was pl'ing a twink and finally got him up to a level where he could group
with my main, a 64 chanter. The twink is now a 42 ranger. In City of Mist
the ranger could group with the chanter and get xp, but I'd been there a
while and it was getting boring so I needed a change. So off we head to
Nadox where I figured I'd dire charm a mob in the room in front of the
nautilus room near the fire. Now I've dire charmed mobs in this room several
times before without a problem  and never once had a resist. This time I get
there and get the message "this mob is too high of a level to be dire
charmed". Not once, but on different 3 mobs. So there I am with 3 mezzed
mobs and no real dps so I call it and zone out. So here's my questions.

1: Have they changed the level of mobs in nadox?
2: Have they nerfed Dire Charm with the rest of the charm nerfs?
3: Or does grouping with a lower level char reduce the level of mob you can
charm?
4: If so, can you Dire Charm the mob first and then group with the lower
level char or won't that char get xp then?

Any info you can give would be appreciated. I haven't had time to play
around with it at this point. Thanks.
