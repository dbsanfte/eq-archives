Yeah, the limit is 10. I'd love to have more than 10 but I'm not going to
complain. ;-)

It's really easy to accidentally delete a gem set, by the way, because:

a) It's a hierarchical menu that doesn't preserve highlight on the initial
parent so if you choose Delete and then pop up the list of available 10, you
won't see that Delete is where you started. What this means is that you
might attempt to try to Load but accidentally have hit Delete, and then when
you have the list of ten, you won't have any indication that you're about to
delete your next choice; and
b) There is no confirmation before a delete.

Because of this, it's best to set up a hotkey to swap gem sets. I've heard
of people doing this, but I haven't actually seen how it's done. Can anyone
provide a mechanism on how to Hotkey gem set swapping?
