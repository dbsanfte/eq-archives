In my experience both Murphy's and Terminator are less bitter than Guiness
Murphy's is brewed in Ireland (County Cork I believe) and Terminator stout
is a product of the Northwest's McNemamin's brew pubs.  I've had Murphy's 
at Kell's and Tir Na n'Og (before it went away) here in Portland.

They both have the incredibly rich color and flavor that Guiness does.
