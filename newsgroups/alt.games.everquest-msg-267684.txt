Aha, then you  -can- "PL" someone to some extent; since many encounters 
are linked with no way to "single pull" them, if there's a target you 
want to take down but can't without help, I could come and kill other 
mobs in the group, as long as you haven't actually damaged/debuffed them.

Also, what happens if I engage a mob, get it to near death, then zone 
out.  Is it now impossible for anyone to get exp off it until it fully 
heals/debuffs all wear off?  Or does it become fair game?  If the 
former, sounds like training people is even more rude than it was in 
EQ1.  If the latter, then there's another way to PL someone (a way 
which, by the way, also worked fairly well to allow any class to PL 
someone... clumsy, but functional)
