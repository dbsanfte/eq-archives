    People on Stormhammer, and apparently some folks at the last Fan Faire,
were told that there will be a change to an Awakened Sleeper's Tomb "coming
soon". Since the awakening on Stormhammer the subscription base has been
dropping, and they know they have to fix it to keep the server viable. It
was also driven home to them when Abashi asked the Fan Faire crowd if they'd
rather have ST fixed or get new zones put in, and the overwhelming response
was "FIX ST!"
