I think Pacify pulling is a great thing.  I understand why people
think Enchanters wont help them out, but they're over looking
some key elements.
1) Slow isn't as useful as a good haste.  When you have 2 or 3
tank/dps classes you can beat these things faster and with less
mana use if you're well hasted.  (A cheap slow can be used
when slow seems appropriate)
2) Cha:  The ONLY thing that I've ever heard SOE cop to with
chrisma is that if you fail a pacify (or similar) they make a chrisma
check to see if the mob will agro on you.  I've seen first hand that
having a 142 cha on my cleric (lower level alt) does make a huge
difference compared to my 60 cha normal.  (dual stein & shaman
buff)  So when my Enchanter has 185ish w/o steins, can't be beat.
Plus, if a bad pull does come in, they're not headed straight for
the cleric.  (Once a pally gets high enough to pacify hes obviouly
a better choice over a cleric)
3) CC: Sure, the over pull isn't too bad with pacify, but you
can't beat the enchanters ability at it.
4) Magic Resist: Group Resist Magic is the best in the game!
5) KEI Dispelled: Granted, I haven't had a KEI dispelled while
crawling yet, but since you cannot summon drogmor's in the
caverns, a lack of mana regen could really hurt.
6) Intellectual Superiority: I know it says that it just decreases
fizzle rate, but in all my experience I've landed more spells with
this than just on my own.  And in LDoN where MOBs resist
like crazy, this is a gem of a spell.
(I also play a bard, and being the pacifier for a group is not
the best role for a bard, its a bit awkard, a bit slow, and
doesn't seem to last anywhere near a long as pacify)

Bard haste will do if you don't have a enchanter or shaman,
but I agree it isn't the best around.

Eh, I've found charming critters to be a mix bag at best.
Our Nukes seem to be mana efficient enough that I'd probably
go that way.
