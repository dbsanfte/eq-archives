It is not objectionable to reasonable people when used as a synonym of
coward/wimp/easy beat etc which is what it was clearly used for here.  The
fact that you see every second word in the english language as a slur
against women is what's lamentable.

Is "beaver" objectionable when used to describe hard work?  Is "snatch"
objectionable when used to describe grabbing at something?

If he'd wanted to liken the other player to a vagina in a derrogatory
fashion, he'd have used "cunt", or more mildly and wrongly in the situation,
"twat".

He probably got some narrow sighted GM who's got the same lamentable hang
ups as you.  Any reasonable GM would have sent an email saying that the word
was on the bad list because it can be used in a sexist way and even though
the customer was not using it that way, had deliberately bypassed the list
and that was why he was being suspended.

I never said it *just* meant wimp.  I said in this context it just meant
wimp.

Well go and live your life by Blizzard policy, and do so blindly.  You've
got a thing about having your arse kissed, well go kiss their corporate one.
