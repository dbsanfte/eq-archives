You got that right! ;)

Also, I guess that while any old monkey can port a PC game to the Mac,
the level of support that a MMORPG demands means they can pretty much
have the Mac market to themselves, tiny as it may be.

Well, the PC games market in general seems to be shrinking... MMORPGS
are amongst the last of the game genres that are unquestionably better 
handled by a personal computer... Perhaps this is also one of  the 
reasons for the move into the Mac market.
