I can see it now...

Annie: "Well, actually, I'm a disembodied brain floating in a tank."
Pathetic_Sex_Crazed_Teen_01: "Kick ass. I've never cybered with a
disembodied brain floating in a tank... so how big are you?"

I actually heard someone say, "Yeah, but your character's a chick..." when a
female friend of mine said she was a guy to get someone off her back.

That's a whole new kind of low.
