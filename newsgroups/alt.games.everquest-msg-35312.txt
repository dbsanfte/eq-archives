Here is the entire list of EQ codes/cheats/music from there:






Everquest Cheats


Gain Exp in the hills
                   Go to Qeynos Hills and search for Rabid Grizzleys. They are
about level 12 to 14. Kill them (while watching  for Cros or Holly who will
kill your character because you are attacking animals), then steal the rabid
pelt off them. Take the pelt to the UFO in North Qeynos and hand them into the
Priestess wearing leather. You will get VERY good exp, 1 to 2pp and a spell
(usually endure disease).

Lower Level Exp gaining
                   Go to Qeynos Area before attempting this trick, and around
level 2-4. Once you reach level 3, go to Qeynos hills and kill Gnolls, Gnoll
pups ,   Gnoll scouts or Gnoll watchers. They may drop gnoll fangs. If they do,
pick it up and collect 4 (or more) gnoll fangs and take them to the  captain of
the gaurds that overlooks the arena. Give him 4 teeth at a time. He will give
you lots of exp and 4 moonstones. Give the  moonstones to the bartender in the
back of the bar in South Qqeynos. He will also give you exp.
