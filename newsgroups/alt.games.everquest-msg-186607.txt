It is a serious pain in the ass, the tenth time you have to run across West
Karana without sow to get to Everfrost, or sit on the dock waiting for that damn
boat to cross OOT.  At true noob levels, as a wood elf,  it's not too bad, since
you can run pretty much anywhere in Faydwer.  But as far as I'm concerned, the
new transportation system makes the game much more fun.
