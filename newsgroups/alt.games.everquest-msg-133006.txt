So there I am in Shadowhaven, wondering what to do next, when
a tell comes in.  Rez request, I mock the guy a little but heck, he's
bound in Shar Val and dead at the zone line to SH in paladul... at
14 I can see where thats a problem for an SK Iksar.  And he was
polite and I'm genuinely not busy.

So I zone in. Start looking for body.  Wander all the way out
to the bandits.  Group is pulling there, bodies everywhere... and
this guy isn't one of em.  One member of the group sends me
a tell, "can u buff us plz?"

I say nothing, just keep looking.  Get a group invite.  Hmm.
From the begger.  Dont hit follow or disband, just ignore it.
Look some more.  Ask the dead guy where his body is, get
some not very clear directions.

"Are u going to buff us?"

"Hit follow"

OK, so this guy knows enough to know that I can't wrap
Heroic Bonds around his head at his level unless I group
and cast it on myself.  So whats he doing begging?

Silly green bandits are aggroing all over me, I'm forced to
kill em cause the "miss" spam is bugging me.  Click tremor
boots, dead.  Still ignoring the begger.

Now I get a tell from someone else.

Heya Bergh, its me (name of her main, who I recognize)
have time to buff our group up for me?

Sure, no problem, just looking for this dead lizzard, (name)
Who is your leader.

Sure enough, the begger.  Thats a moral dilemna for you.

I hit follow and buffed them up, HB and NM.  Then I ask
who the tank is.  Yep, begger. So I disband and leave the
zone, giving up on the poor lizard's CR.

Now, am I a soft touch?  I think so, trying to rez that guy
who was in a fix but hardly a huge one.  And buffing up
that group against my better judgement.

Or am I an ass?  After all, I blew off the CR just cause it
wasn't as easy as advertised.  And I didn't SOW the
MT of that group, even after finding out who it was.

Oh well, just another EQ adventure in morality, I suppose
