Shield does work only on melee attacks.

However, mobs aren't all that clever, and will TRY and protect their buddies
even though they have no hope of doing so.

You'll also see mobs you are chant kiting Enrage, for example... this allows
them to autoriposte any melee attack from their front quadrant and can be
devastating, except that you continue to run circles around them pounding on
that drum, and chuckling about how impressive Enrage would be if you were trying
to kill them by hitting them with a stick.
