So, I jump on today, feel like perusing the newsgroups...when suddenly I'm hit
with a barrage of stupid.

My brain hurts from unsnipped posts, top posting, long, drawn out, point to
point discussions over something that is 100% Grade A, USDA Choice OFF TOPIC, 
dead threads being drug up from the briney deep..you name it.

Read this. Saves you from getting flamed. Like, 50sv Fire.
