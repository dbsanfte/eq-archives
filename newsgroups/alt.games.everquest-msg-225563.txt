If you dont control the means of production then you *cannot* control the
price.  You have 20 people agree to sell essence of sunlight for no less
than 500p.  So what stops player 21 from farming a stack and selling for 400
each?  You could buy him out but then he can farm another stack.  The faster
you remove his supply of lower priced goods from the bazaar the more you
encourage him to farm more.
