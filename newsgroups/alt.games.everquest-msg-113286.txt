Any race and class combination can be rewarding to play. That said,
some are more challenging than others. 

I always recommend that a new player start with something simple, like
a good-aligned warrior. This is just as a way to learn the basic game
mechanics and get your feet wet. Once you are more familiar with
things, you'll have a better idea of what character you want to play.

And, of course, you should try several different combinations. With
umpteen servers, and up to eight characters per server, there really
aren't any limits.

Everyone has a different playing style, but give some thought to the
idea that the game isn't a race to the highest level. Take the time to
just wander around, playing tourist. The EQ world is pretty
interesting, even outside of the hack-and-slash.

Might as well install everything.
