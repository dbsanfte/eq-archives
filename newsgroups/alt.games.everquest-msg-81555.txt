Deep cleansing breaths.

On the lower left-hand quadrant of the transparent inventory screen
there is a box labeled "Auto Equip Area" (or something very much like
that).  If you're dumping foraged food, just do it there and it will
be added to whatever stack you have in your inventory.  

And as for the transparent screen, remember, it's pretty damned
configurable.  You can turn off the opaque background of the
transparent screens by hitting the "`" (way up there on the upper left
side of your keyboard.  The various windows can be moved around and
resized.  To move a box, click on the little square in the upper left
hand side of whatever one you want to move, (Just click, don't click
and hold) then move it where ever.  To resize a box, click the little
square in the lower right hand side (once again, just click, don't
click and hold) and resize it to your liking.  

Personally speaking, the Abilities/Socials box kind of clutters up the
screen, so I just put what ever abilities I want on hotkeys and then
close the Abilities Box by hitting Alt-M.  You can open back up if
necessary by hitting Alt-M again.  ALL of the various screens can be
opened and closed in a similar manner, although off the top of my head
I don't remember the various commands.  There are .ini file editors
out there that can help you with a lot of this stuff too.

Also, to help with the clutter, try increasing your EQ resolution.
800x600 makes things pretty roomy.

I understand that YMMV, but I LOVE the transparent inventory screen.
I think once you get used to them, you'll probably like it more too.
