useful to do...go now go on..5 mins till the end of Norath."...1 min
later"GM-Downtown- uhhh i said leave damn it you useless inbreds..go now..get a
life..4 mins till we shut her down" "
   
  1 min later "GM-Downtown-uhh now damn it i think i made myself clear now
didnt i? hmm guess not time to make some examples of some people..i shall
unleash the rath of Norath on all of you in 3 mins if you are not gone...

   .1 min later.....a red flame shines in the sky plummeting to the
ground..secs later a huge boom is unleashed across east commons...as the smoke
clears 5000 hill giants roam through east commons smashing everyone at will...

  .SYSTEM MESSAGE GM Downtown- "Uhh sorry people i thought i told you all to
leave...hmm better do so now before its too late...2 mins till server shut
down....
      ....meanwhile the smashing and bashing continues low lvlers run to slate
only to find his corspe scattered across the inn door step, and all the guards
running.
