That will easily run the game out in Antonica on 'Balanced' settings, 
however when you enter the city you will have to drop it down to pretty 
much the lowest settings to stop it chugging along. I was running a 
system almost identical to this one in every way, and it handled it fine 
for the most part.

A lot of folk mentioned the memory when I asked the same question, so 
I'll just emphasise...get an extra 512MB of RAM, 1GB will allow you to 
run the game fairly near to the highest performance level with no 
noticeable slowdown at all :-)
