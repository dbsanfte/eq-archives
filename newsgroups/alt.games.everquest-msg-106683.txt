They are considered irretrievable, but I digged one up in SolA some time
ago. Get Fire Resistance up decently (120+ or so) and put EB up. Swim around
till you find it and /corpse it. There is a small plateau somewhat north
east of the middle of the zone (path from NW side with Kindle to the Gnomes
in NE side I think) where you can walk out of the lava.

Also note that you can walk over lava without damage if you have levitate up
and aren't looking down.
