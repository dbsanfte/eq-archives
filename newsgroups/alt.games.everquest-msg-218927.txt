no seriousley though if you can afford the price for all the stuff then get:

Earring of the Solstice:
AC 5, STA 5, WIS 8, INT 8, HP 55, mana 55, sv fire 5, sv cold 5, sv magic 5
recommended level 51
flowing thought 1
wt 0.1
no drop and lore
ALL/ALL

and if you can afford 2 of each of the items then do the first one for the
above earring then do the combine again and get:

Xanthe's Earring of Nature
AC 5, str 8, sta 8, wis 10, hp 55, mana 55, sv fire/cold/magic 7
Lore - Druid Only No Drop
Effect: Circle of Combines
