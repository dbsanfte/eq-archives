free version of zone alarm and having problems? I'm in shock... I work for
an isp and I would say at least 15% of our problems come from that damned
program. All software firewalls are vulnerable. I'm not going to say how as
it could be considered trolling. If you have a cable modem with dynamic I.P.
you ARE going to have problems with the defaults of zone alarm. Zone alarm
also does not have technical support that techs can direct there clients to.
The point of my rambling is, if you want security and you want to keep
people out, get a hardware firewall. There are no 100% safe firewalls but
IMO hardware are much more stable than software firewalls
