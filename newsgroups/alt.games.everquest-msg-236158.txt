Your link doesn't work for me, but here's a page I made for my guild a while
back so the members could find the good loot droppers.  Some of the info may
be incorrect, but it's close to being right:

We let the slaves all go free and I sure do love my Necklace.  Seems like
all the caster stuff I see drop on raids are Neck items, though.  Hard to
upgrade this puppy with the mobs we are dropping.

My 45 BST is in Nurga now, and enjoying it.
