Right.  However, there ARE interface changes that could make it much
more convenient for casters without affecting game balance.  For
example, they could give us multiple banks of spell gems, but make it
so that switching between them made you sit down and open the book,
and it would take the same time as memming the new spells (with an
optimization that a spell that is in both banks does not need to be
rememmed).  This would be purely an organizational convenience.
