Yeah, I was disappointed that the "Lore" button was greyed out.  I'd
like to know more about the story of the new zone.

I didn't see that level range in the blurb - it said that there was
loot for all levels in there so I assumed that it was for levels 20+ as
that is the minimum level for Nektulos.  If that is the case I'll have
to cancel my pre-order ASAP as my highest character is 26 and I have
stopped playing him because I switched my main to be another character
who is only level 18.
