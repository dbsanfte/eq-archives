We share most of the first half of our epic with rangers, but the only major
things there are the CoM reavers, DE corruptors and VSR.

Reavers are on a fast enough timer that sharing them isn't really a burden
given how often they're actually killed.
As well as the splitting they do when you kill them (spawning another one
right on top).

DE corruptor is a triggered spawn and the person you trigger it with is on a
1 hour spawn, fast enough to not be a significant hindrance.

VSR on the other hand is on a timer that's at least a day, he's still not as
bad as Ragefire, at least he drops *2* stones per kill.

And warriors have to kill Queen Velazul Di'Zok.
