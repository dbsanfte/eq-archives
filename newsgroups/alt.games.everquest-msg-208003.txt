*wow*

I read each and every note, with interest.  Being the 'OP' I have some
more information to help folks understand where I am coming from.

I have two infant, twin boys, that when I play EQ, need attention from time
to time, and don't understand what it means to wait.  "I want that bottle
now, in fact I wanted it FIVE minutes ago....".  Same with 'sleepy time'
and 'rock me, hold me, cause I want it now' time.  So grouping is kinda
out for another few weeks.

I have my skills in 1HS, 2HS, Taunt, kick, bash and all the automated skill
sets at as high as they go for the level I am at.  Unfortunately Hand to
Hand,
peircing, throwing suck total beans, like 10 or some such horrible number.

What I do is engage a blue solo mob, kill it, then go, limping sometimes, to
a spot to do fletching skillups, tailoring, or brewing, or blacksmitthing.

I fund my higher than usual end armor with the results of this downtime.
I have nice centi swords, two rings that give +6 ac and like 65 hp each,
and some imbued armor for Rallos Zek.  Picked the wrong god of course,
but what to knowwhen you just start out.

Found out the hard way about the Corrupted Mammy spawning after the death
of the tainted one....another cold corpse run, but lots of laughs on the way
as
people shouted "hey there naked boy,' along the way.  I do remember this is
a game.  This character is the highest level one I have on Luclin, I have a
cleric
and an enchanter, a shaman, and DEF ShadowKnight.     Frankly, I like
beat'in
on folks more than finger wigglin'.


the help has been helpful,

Mccarron Luclin
