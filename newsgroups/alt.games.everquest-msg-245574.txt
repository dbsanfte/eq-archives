Druid/Enc is powerful mainly because you're using charmed mob DPS/hit 
points instead of a normal PC tank.  Done right, it truly can be 
devastating.  And if you decide to do a normal group, you're looking for a 
tank and 3 anything, which will generally be easier to fill than other 
combos, where you'd (generally) need a healer+3, CC+3, or a slower+3.  
That's kinda thinking inside the holy trinity box though. :)

Necro/Rogue could also be very powerful, given two very high DPS classes 
there and most of the other tools you'd need, like snare and healing, and 
the potential to fear kite.  But I personally don't know enough about 
those classes to say what's best about them.
