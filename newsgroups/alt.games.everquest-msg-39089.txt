There is one guy on my server who has 6 PCs with a keyboard/monitor
switch arrangement so he can play a whole group at once.

Kind of impressive, in its own way - he can pull and tank and heal and
crowd control simultaneously, better than all but the best individual
players.

But people like that are a tiny minority, at least outside the ToV
North-conquering guilds. And people in those guilds usually have better
stuff to do than farm anything green to them. With two level 60
characters, you can get a lot better loot than can be got from a level
10 with out-of-combat help from a 60.
