AFAIK they did not deliberately change it.  At some point languages
got bugged so that you couldn't learn them at all (not sure how long
ago that happened, autumn of last year I think), then they "fixed" it
into the condition I mentioned above.  I have no idea whether it has
finally been straightened out (i.e. returned to the rules you posted)
or not.  For that matter, it's possible that the trouble was only on
FV server, that's the only place I heard it talked about and also the
only place I wanted to learn languages at the time.
