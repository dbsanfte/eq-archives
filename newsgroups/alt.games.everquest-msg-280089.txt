Neither, unless you need MGB for raids or you think DC will be an amusing toy.
Increasing heals, nukes, mana regen, or defensive abilities will add more
to your effectiveness in normal play.  

>And if DC, where could I possibly go to utilise this skill?

I'm an enchanter, so my uses for it are more varied, and I consider it pretty
worthless past level 60.  it was AWESOME when the level cap was 60 and you got
decent xp for mobs that a L46 buffed pet could easily kill.  Now it's just a
toy.  And for druids, it'a a restricted toy.

A quick google on "druid dire charm" found
http://www.eqdruids.com/reference/alternate_abilities/qmon_direcharm.htm.
Looks like it's handy for farming, and a few tier 1 and 2 PoP zones.
