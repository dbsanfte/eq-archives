I dont know the answer to that question, but I do suggest you stop wasting
time training it, and just dump your research points into it instead. Theres
really nothing else that you need them for, and it saves so much time and
hassle. Even with maxed research, Id sooner get a level 50+ necro to make up
my spells for me, cos I dont want to risk losing those components. Ive never
found a problem getting someone to make them up for me.
