if i were you i would hop the evil barge/boat, should be easy for you to
avoid the ogres near the dock with camo, just hop off the boat before it
docks in OT and swim ashore.
on a side note, i would consider moving to FM now if i were you, found xp to
be much better post 30 in a good group at the giant fort there
