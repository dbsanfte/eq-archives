See, Calefaction is really a shitty nuke (which I never bought), it
cast in 2.5 seconds, but is mana expensive and really slow recast.
It's just for when you want firepower NOW.
Level 39 Firestrike is 302 dmg for 155 mana
Level 49 Starfire is 612 dmg for 250 mana

And, a cleric with Retribution hasn't had a new nuke since level 29.

You know, you're not the one supposed to be smacked ;) (I find the DS
of bladecoat to be a little perk in my self only AC buff and I am not
going to cry because it won't let me porcupine at 60)

Fury of Air, level 34, 250 DD and 2.5 second stun, works indoors.

But mostly not anywhere near as well as a druid.

But this still doesn't allow them to do it anywhere near as well as a
druid, and the items are not cleric specific (cept for faithstones).
