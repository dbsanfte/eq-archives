Well I'm done replying to this thread since it seems from something
the site owner posted that she is sensitive about this subject. It was
never my intention to cause her more problems but rather to possibly
bring up something to be cautious about in the world of "donation"
sites. I then saw from what a couple other people posted that I'd
missed most of the warnings about what the "donations" could be used
for (rendering my post pretty moot ;) )

Whoever bothered to draw her attention to this thread on what she
calls "the pit of chaos that is usenet", I guess you succeeded in your
quest to make her feel worse about her site. This, however, had
nothing to do with me and everything to do with you. So give yourself
a pat on the back if that was your intention. I frankly think it was
bad form. 

The nature of usenet is such that if I feel like posting a concern I
have to a totally unregulated free forum (except for wildly off topic
things like spam) not ran by anyone in particular that I can do so in
this neutral area. That is precisely while I mentioned it here. If I
intended to start things up on her own site I would have mentioned it
there. The feedback here more than satisfied me though, which again is
kind of the purpose of usenet.

I guess it comes down to this, anyone like myself who does not wish to
donate doesn't have to pretty much due to the definition of the word
"donate."
