If you have luclin, you can get to kunark via nexus, but thats a run through
DL.
From there ogre island, the boat comes in from the east and sails out to the
west.
If you dont line being near the ogres, just wait out on the water, west of
the island a bit on the water(sow, lev, camo).
Youll need to jump the boat as soon as it zones into ot. Youre kos at the
docks.
You could catch the boat from butcher to FV instead. Thats where the "good"
city is.
