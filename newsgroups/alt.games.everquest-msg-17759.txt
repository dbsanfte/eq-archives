EQ has somewhat flaky support for the SBLive and recently there have
been a lot of problems posted on the tech boards at the station, most of
which seem to be people with VIA chipsets with an SBLive.

I'm guessing the mobo is using a VIA Apollo KT133 chipset with a name
like that - I don't know if this would be a problem or not with your
particular configuration, but there are known incompatibilities with VIA
chipsets and SBLive cards - VIA have basically admitted that their
chipset is buggy as hell with them and will be releasing new drivers and
bios updates 'real soon now'. I myself have a VIA chipset with an SBLive
Value and I've been crashing in EQ regularly since the 30/5/01 patch,
(ditto on another VIA machine with onboard sound, my Intel chipset
machine works fine) and after 3 weeks of troubleshooting I'm probably
just going to take the opportunity to upgrade my PC by throwing out my
old motherboard, assuming there isn't a stealth fix for this issue in
today's patch.

I'll back this up by quoting VIA's website, at
http://www.viahardware.com/686bfaq.shtm

It doesn't help that the SBLive drivers aren't WHQL certified and
haven't been updated in over a year.

So, you may want a different mobo, or a different soundcard. (cue a mass
of followups of 'I'm using that setup and it works fine!')

Oh, I dunno - anyone tried a Diamond Monstersound or something with EQ?
