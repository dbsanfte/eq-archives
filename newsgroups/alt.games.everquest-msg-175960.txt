Varies with me....sometimes back to the desktop. SOmetimes to the login -
not sure why. /camp invariably goes to character selection though.

Deadly accurate typing of the keywords. Checking whether you think the
tense needs changing which soetimes it does, sometimes it doesnt. Try
fractioning the keywords....if it says 'Will you [help me with a
delivery]' then sometimes 'What delivery' works, sometimes you have to
type 'I will help you with a delivery'

Its just fiddling around. SOme wont respond because you dont have the
faction, though usually you get a rude response rather than silence. If
all else fails shout to the zone for syntax.

Smithing vendors. Most cities should have them. Neriak definitely does but
IIRC its in the first section of the city in an unusual place...go to
www.eqtraders.com and look for smithing supplies list and it'll tell you
the location in Neriak that sell.

Always always pull with an arrow. Increase your dex. If you can shoot more
than once - do so. Fletch a little so as you can make cheap long range
arrows (range 150) this gives more shots.

If you feel brave go to the commonlands and ask if anyone soloing
something big minds you plunking a few arrows in while they kill the
critter. As a low level you shouldnt do much damage so you wont take xp
but you should get a lot of shots without risking yourself getting aggro.

If you are brave, get a SoW, and run round shooting things and then zone
to lose aggro. Come back and rinse/repeat.

> Sometimes I get spell interrupted when I am standing perfectly still ?

There is a short lag between you stopping on screen and being ready to
cast. FOr some reason the game doesnt count turning left right as moving
and that clears the buffer and lists you instantly as not moving....so I
take my finger of the forward or back key, hit left or right and fire the
spell.....no interrupts.

Steep slopes you can slide on and that does the interrupt too as the game
detects forward/back motion....spinning looks silly but does stop this I
find...
