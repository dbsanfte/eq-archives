You can avoid the pop up, by telling Zonealarm that the following 
programs change Frequently : eqgame.exe , everquest.exe. This is done in 
the program control screen in Zonealarm, right click on the program name 
and select the 'changes frequently' option.

After that you should have no problems with Zonealarm
