So, basically, a few MB wizards were assholes, and ruined it for all of
them?  That was the gist of what I got from reading Verant's reasons for
nerfing MB.  Well, that, and the way it trivialized some encounters.  When
we took down Ragefire, we had 3 MB wizards come along to help, it was quite
anticlimactic, I think RF lived for 15 seconds max.  We are a social guild,
very far from uber, and RF would normally be a very tough raid for us.
