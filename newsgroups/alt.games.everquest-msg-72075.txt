You can.
But it's not because you're faster than Whoashit (he's a druid so will
be SoWed and of course, have zero lag in that stupid zone).  It's
because he'll stop to cast.

And there's an oddball aspect of this game that most folks don't know:
When an NPC is casting before it's aggroed, during that cast, it can't
be range aggroed.

For example, Gleed under the icebridge leading to Tormax is on Rif
faction.  He sees invis and if you attempt to cross the bridge while
KOS to Rifs, you're toast.

However, if you wait until you see the message:

Gleed SomethingSomething begins to cast a spell.

Then run across while he is still casting, he won't aggro on you.

Same thing happens with Whoashit.  If you just happen to pop in when
Whoashit is going through his normal routine of selfbuffing the crap
outta himself (SoW, thorns, firefist?!?, etc...), you can run out of
range before he has a chance to aggro.  

I do not however, recommend relying on this for Whoashit.
