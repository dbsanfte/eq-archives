I've got a monk and I seem to be outdamaged by rangers, rogues,
beastlords, and beserkers.  I watch SK's and bards pull at least as
well as me.  I get smacked around like a 2 dollar whore.  And have
next to no mitigation.

I love the toon, it was my first.  And will play it as an alt as long
as I play EQ.

This is not a bitch fest nor a flame war spark, just a question.  I
don't have the time to become uber with gear or AA's, so my monk will
be forever mediocre in those terms.  Curiosity is all really.

Thanks.
