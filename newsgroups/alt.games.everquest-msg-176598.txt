Now that your past 10th level, you'll start leveling up a little more
slowly...and more slowly every level thereafter, so you'll have more
time to max out weapon skills.

At 13th, you'll get dual wield and get to skill up in two 1h weapons
at a time (1hs and pierce, for example). Swap 'em back and forth to
balance out the primary hand getting more skillups due to dual wield
not fireing very often at first (dual wield will increase rapidly once
you start using it).

As a Warrior, I decided to forgo bash in favor of kick, especially
after I got dual wield. If you like, you can continue working on bash
until then. You'll have plenty of time to max kick once you stop using
a shield. (I have recently started "gheto bashing" to raise my bash
skill. I don't think I'm gonna need bash, but I wanted to bring it up
anyways.)

If you're a large race (ogre, troll, barb), I understand that the slam
skill raises bash skill, so you can alternate between using kick and
slam to max them both each level.

If one or two weapons skills lag behind just a little, it's not that
big a deal. At 39, you'll reach the cap of 200 skill for sub 50th
level and have the next 11 levels to "top off" the other weapons
skills. After 50, you can probably max out all your weapons skills
before you get a yellow bubble of xp.

I also decided to forgo improving my 2hb skill. I'm sure I'll regret
it one day and keep meaning to practice it (finding an xp group that
doesn't mind me standing by and wacking on their mobs with a low delay
2hb weapon - I hear a shovel is a good bet for this). At 51, my 2hb
skill is 1 :).

Anyways, to raise you're weapons skills as fast as possible, try to
use low delay weapons for each skill. That gives you more swings, so
more opportunities to skill up.
