My concern is that I beleive that in general getting the tradeskill 
drops tends to be much much easier for most items than getting the mob 
drops, or quest items. This is because its anticipated that the 
tradeskiller will need many many many sets of drops to get the 
skillups... they drop comparatively more often, because they know you 
need piles of them (plus they expect you to fail often).

If you only need one, and you likely won't fail the combine then it gets 
too easy.

Once one person in the guild has reached a suitably high tradeskill 
level, this becomes the reality. It becomes relatively trivial for 
everyone else to bring him enough components for one combine.

I think your suggestion has a lot of merit. But I'm skeptical ... I fear 
that getting the tradeskill drops will be much easier than getting 
anything else, once the guild is a bit established.

Furthermore, since we've touched previously on the idea that it would be 
ok to pool tradeskill drops it becomes even messier if all the items 
that you are expecting a guy to farm are already lieing neatly stacked 
in the guild bank, but that's a separate issue. :p

If indeed the drops are at least generally equivalently rare. I'd be ok 
with it. There are many items for which this doesn't hold though.

Hrm. I still think the the guild bank would rapidly be bursting at the 
seams if tradeskill and dropped gear were even "attunable". I think most 
found gear should be 'no drop'. Perhaps some concessions should be made 
for exceedinly rare drops.

And trandeskills... ugh... most of that should be no drop, with an 
attunable exception for players who commission a combine out of farmed 
components.

If you farm the stuff and do the combine its yours, no questions asked, 
no eyebrows raised, nothing. The item however is considered no drop.

If you farm the stuff, you can have someone in the guild do the 
combine... maybe with a level appropriateness forumla in effect related 
to the trivial. Maybe with exclusions made to specific items if it 
becomes apparent that farming a little spider silk for Wu's is a little 
too easy and is undermining 'more interesting' progressions.

Or perhaps it should simply dealt with along other lines. You farm it, 
you can have it combined no questions asked. But you can only run 30% or  
50% tradeskilled items by proxy. (Again if you make everything 
yourself... you can wear 100% of it.)

Or perhaps a combination of the two.

I dunno... this is Rumble's vision... I'm just saying how I might do it.
