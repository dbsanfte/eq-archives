And to hit a little closer to home, there is at least one group of
primates besides humans (I believe it is gibbon's) that engage in
homosexual behavior as a form of bonding.  Heck, the little guys are just
oversexed and happy, so I think they don't really care what your equipment
is, they just want to be friends. :P

I've come into this thread a little late due to RL distractions, but I
wanted to comment with amusement that I bet that somewhere out there is
someone (not necessarily on this group, but I bet they exist) that on one
hand would argue that creationism should be added to school books and on
the other would use the "homosexuality is unnatural, natural selection
says so!" argument on the other.  

All the people (again not specifying anyone here, cuz I've not read slow
enough to catch who is on which side, and even if there are sides) who are
getting their moral panties in a bind because two human beings, regardless
of gender, want to formalize their love and companionship...well, seems
like they have a big wedgie coming to them in the first place, so they can
go unbind their panties in the little boys and girls room whilst the rest
of us worry about issues that actually matter.

Hmph.
