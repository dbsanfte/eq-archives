hehe, nice to hear its all worked out. I'm looking into upgrading froma 350
to a 450  so i can get a better video card, im slowly building my system up
nice and putting the old parts ontp a mobo about the same age as this one ,
my goal is to make this comp nice and the guinee pig as i like to call it
this one minus the mobo/chipset so i can 2box both myaccount happily.

              that is what bums me out is LFG, maybe it's because im without
a guild (i have an app with a great buncha folks  right now *crosses
fingers* , but i get discouraged i wanna 2box my cleric and enchanter,
because tanks are a dime a dozen,  and well once u got a cleric and
enchanter, you can make a group in a matter of minutes usually. but either
class alone will sit LFG for long periods of time /shrug
