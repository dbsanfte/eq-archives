You don't have to extract them.  They are all already in your EQ folder,
appropriately named, with an extension of XMI.  Just copy them to another
location, change the extention to .mid, and play them with your favorite
midi player.  I don't think Windows Media works, however.  I use Winamp or
MusicMatch.

Best Regards
