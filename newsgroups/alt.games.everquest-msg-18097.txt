That's actually not that uncommon.  On my server at least, there aren't a
huge number of Magicians.  It's quite possible for someone to get to level
35 or more, and never group with one.  And many of the existing low-level
Magicians are power-leveling Alts, so they don't bother to buy any spell
that doesn't directly relate to killing stuff.  So a lot of people on my
server have absolutely know idea what a Magician does, besides controlling
the pet and summoning Mod Rods at some point.  (Most of them know that
Magicians can summon the rods, but aren't sure exactly what they do or when
Magicians can provide them.  They have no clue what any of the other
summoned items do.  I almost had to kick the crap out of a Monk who kept
handing weapons to my pet while we were camping Shadowed Men.  The group
finally got him to understand that for that particular monster, Swords of
Runes were better than the Shadowed Weapons he kept giving the pet. 
Unfortunately, the pet was looking at the same stats as the Monk, so it
kept switching to the useless shadowed weapons.  We were also trying to
hunt in Kithicor, and moving back and forth, which is why it was a
recurring problem - I kept having to make new pets each time we zoned.)
