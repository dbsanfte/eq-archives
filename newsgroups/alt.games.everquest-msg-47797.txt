This is a first for me... but.. come on.  Bandwidth?  Its 1kb in size, if
that.  The fact of the matter is this.  The response BONDA gave was
offensive.

To further ridicule someone for posting to the wrong newsgroup is un-called
for.  Where have manners gone today? (dont get me on the manners thing
saying something silly like "well where was his/her manners in posting to
the wrong GD newsgroup" since we cannot prove without a reasonable doubt it
was on purpose)

If you are going to give a long lecture on the whys and why nots, you could
have also just as easily said something like, "You're test went through,
however, there is a newsgroup devoted to such tests at  alt.test"

In that above sentence, you get your point across, don't sound like a prick
without a date and more than likely (-assuming- this person intends on
frequenting this newsgroup) an appology from the person (also -assuming-
someone gives him the time or day to give one without first having his/her
head chopped off).

<shrug> Do what you will of course, but, you just -never- know when a person
may hold the answer to a question you may have, what you might one day wish
to request from someone you previously slapped around like a rag doll on a
kindergarden playground, etc, etc. :(

Be nice, it's all about being nice. :)
