After someone hinted at this on the official message boards I went
and did something again that I'd checked bfore and could not do.

I went and stuck a poacher's head on the head ranger guy in surefall,
with my dark elf cleric who is dubious to him. Then I hit the hide key
until he was indiff, then I completed the trade. Boom, faction instead
of a diss.

In case you don't know, in the old UI when you try to hit a hotkey 
like hide it said you can't do that now or something or just ignored
it ( forget which.) I have long wished that was not true. 

So I don't know if this is a temporary bug/exploit or whatever. The
way I figure though verant made the new UI the way they wanted to make
it and if they want me to be able to hide while in trade window then
so be it! If you want to raise some factions with this new "feature",
now might be the time.

I only wish that she had a ton of gnoll canines from jaggedpine zone
so she could use halflng form which makes her dubious to the guard
there, then turn them in and hide making her indiff. My druid was able
to turn the canines in for faction at indiff.

Essentially all this does is skip the "buddy" step where without this
new "feature" you'd have to have a friend invis you while in the trade
window.
