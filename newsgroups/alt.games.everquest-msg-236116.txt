	There's really no excuse for this amount and schedule of 
downtime.  Fixes to fix fixes to the patches to the fixes.  It's true
that they have no published SLA.  That doesn't relieve them of the
professional responsibility to keep there service available as much
as possible.  It's my opinion that they make no effort to fulfill that 
most basic of a service provider's responsibilities. It's obvious that
their QA is of the "Passes the smoke test!   Ship it!" school of thought,
which is another common cost saving measure that not only doesn't work
but doesn't even save costs.

	I'm just glad that Sony doesn't own an airline.
