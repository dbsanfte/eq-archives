Funny you should mention that.

My IRL funds are nowhere near sufficient to traipse around on international 
flights all the time. 

My point: There's nowhere in Norrath (not counting planes) that is 
unreachable by foot. If you don't like hiking, pay for a port. If you don't 
like paying for a port, hike. 'Nuff said.
