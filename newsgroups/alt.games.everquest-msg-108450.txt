You would think that the monthly raise would give you better service.
Although, no GMs are hardly on, petitionings take forever still.... so what
exactly are we paying more for?
As long as they keep making cool stuff, people will stay and pay the monthly
fee.. however i see no better customer service as yet due to the raise.
