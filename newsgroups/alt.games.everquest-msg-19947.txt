Point 1: Since you quoted the relevant part, you really COULD have taken 
the time to snip the original text.

Point 2: How is that any more 'thought police'-ish than the original 
poster having a tantrum because they didn't like a simple 'cutesy' name 
on their server?

(Note: I'm not too into cutesy either, but as long as they were a good 
player, I'd FAR prefer cutesy to offensive.)
