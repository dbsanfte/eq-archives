Even a casual look at server populations would belie this statement.
Doing a /who all on most of the guilds I have truck with shows the
same numbers as pre-Luclin. Pre-50 zones still have the same
populations I've come to expect from them. The number of people who
actually can't play because of the expansion has been extremely small.
Game quality is down because of numerous bugs. Actually playability is
mostly unaffected.

I'm unhappy with the number of bugs that turned up in the expansion. I
think it was rushed to shelves before it was ready because of the
truism that games sell better around Christmas time. I'm glad to see
that VI isn't abandoning the product now that it's out. I imagine that
their coding staff is living at work right now.
