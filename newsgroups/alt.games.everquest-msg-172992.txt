I wouldn't pay more than 5pp for SoW, since you can buy shaman made
potions typically around 10pp a pop (at least on brell).  Typically I'd
pay 2 pp for a SoW or do a reciprical buff.  If you are getting SoE
that's a different matter (fast long lasting SoW with levitate)...

Seems to be 50 pp is expected on brell, You will probably be able to get
away with your lv in pp though, especially if not obviously twinked.

Aegeolism is another good one to get from a cleric.  Skin like Nature is
a favorite of mine as well, AC, HP and long lasting Regen.

If you are a caster with kei I'd suggest killing yellows, avoid reds
unless you really know what you are doing.  Or get an Aegeolism too.
