as we all know varent is re-texturing  everything for the luclin expansion.i
think a neat idea ,that i hope they have done,is for the plains of karana.i
think putting tall knee to waist high yellow grass out there would be
cool.not all over but in large clumps.because karana is clearly based on
African plains.this would give the lion a place to hide and use there yellow
coat for what its there for,and would keep all travelers glued to the grass
for any movement.just a thought.
