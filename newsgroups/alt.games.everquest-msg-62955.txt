That's what greens are for.  The knife procs frequently, and it gives
you L/2 bandages, where L is you level (max one stack), so its not
hard to get a lot of bandages safetly and quickly, if there are greens
around.

Actually, it procs often enough that I think you can even safetly use
it in real fights, without much extra risk, because you don't have to
use it long.
