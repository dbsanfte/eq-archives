Tier 2 and 3 rare minerals are used to make the Ink in App IV and
Adept IIIs - I found a tier 2 rare and made it into a sneak-based
Adept III.

Wood and roots are good for turning into rugs and furniture, when ich
can offset cost for owning an apartment, both in cash per weeks, and
SP.  In the long term, this can easily be worth more than the few gold
you buy them for, as the bigger your room, the more you're saving.

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
