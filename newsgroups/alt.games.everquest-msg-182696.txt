Thats all you need. Copy the files to the second computer, start EQ and 
enter the old username and password. It should just work. The CD keys 
are only necessary once, to activate the account with Sony, but once the 
account has been created (or an expansion enabled) you don't really need 
them.

Well, perhaps you can use them as proof of ownership if your account 
gets hacked or something like that, but generally speaking, you'll never 
need those numbers again.
