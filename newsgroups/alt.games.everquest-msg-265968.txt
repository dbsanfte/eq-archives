Actually Lineage's big base is Korean... and South Korea is per capita 
the most wired country in the world. Also, they count 'per play' 
subscriptions as indivisual subscriptions... You go play tonight in a 
cafe, that's a subscription. Tomorrow night? that's another 
subscription. over here Lineage has a much more modest 40-50k 
subscribers iirc.

Final Fantasy Online has a more 'traditional' gameing subscription 
model, and the last reported subscription level was approximatly 520k 
for Japan and America. I have not seen any figures since the European 
release (But I can tell you they are there... I have to ignore french in 
the chat channels in the city of San'Doria every night, and my server, 
Odin, appears to be the unofficial Norwiegen server, based on the 
language I hear all over, (my cousin, who speaks Norwegian, verified it 
was Norwegian, though he wasn't sure of some terms... said they looked 
like Norwegian leet speak) and the new people flooding it. (Worldpass 
prices on Odin, which are based on how many are issued, doubled the 
first week after the European release.))

Final Fantasy has a couple of major advantages over EQ though: It's an 
existing thematic setting (the Final Fantasy series) that is hugely 
popular, and can be played on the one of the best selling consoles in 
the world (I dunno if the PS2 is number 1 or 2 now... gamecubes may very 
well have surpassed it).
