Another false bit of Cokelore. Coke had been using corn syrup to
flavor their products for a long time before the attempted change to
New Coke. Here's a cut and paste from snopes.com:

An interesting little claim sprang up in the wake of the introduction
of Classic Coke, one having to do with its sweetener. People swore
they detected a change in the flavor between Classic Coke and the
original. This gave rise to the rumor that the product had been
reformulated, dropping cane sugar in favor of high fructose corn
syrup. Depending upon whom you listened to, either the demand for the
return of original Coca-Cola afforded the company the opportunity to
switch from cane sugar to corn syrup or the whole fiasco of taking
original Coca-Cola off the shelves and reintroducing it three months
later as Classic Coke was all a brilliant scheme to mask the change in
sweetener. According to whispered wisdom, the company had hoped to
slip the modification past consumers by having it take place during
the original beverage's absence from the shelves. People would be so
darned glad to have Classic Coke back that they wouldn't notice it
didn't taste the same as original Coca-Cola. (Another twist to this
rumor had it that New Coke had deliberately been formulated to taste
awful in order to facilitate the switch -- this supposedly gave
Coca-Cola an excuse for pulling the original formula and then putting
it back on the market after a brief absence, making it look all along
as if they were simply responding to consumer demands.) 

The change in sweetener wasn't anything that diabolical. Corn syrup
was cheaper than cane sugar; that's what it came down to. In 1980 --
five years before the introduction of New Coke -- half the cane sugar
in Coca-Cola had been replaced with high fructose corn syrup. By six
months prior to New Coke's knocking the original Coca-Cola off the
shelves, there was no cane sugar in American Coca-Cola. Whether they
knew it or not, what consumers were drinking then was 100% sweetened
by high fructose corn syrup.
