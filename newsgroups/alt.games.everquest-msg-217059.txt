I don't know a solid etiquette.  I am a tradeskiller, so I'll typically keep
the tradeskill items if I'm ML and give the party fair market value on the
split, or ask the party for the tradeskill stuff and split the fair market
value.  (BTW, on Xegony you'll find Essence of Moonlight for 10 to 20 pp
each.  Highway robbery.)
