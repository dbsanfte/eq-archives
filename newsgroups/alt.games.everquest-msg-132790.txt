Just where did  particular discussion start?  It's been crossposted
enough.

Anyway, you are falling into the same trap as the other assholes in
the other discussions.

This is not about any kids you know.  This is about kids in Africa who
are all too familiar with AIDS.  And, whether or not you have been
discussing 2-year olds has absolutely nothing to do with the show
itself or its intended audience.

The show has, however, given you and others a platform to spout off
about your own particular hangups, and for that you should be grateful
to it.

You may want to discuss that with any of the hundred or so
organizations that are actually dealing with AIDS in Africa and see
what they have to say.

Be careful, they may ask you for money.  Or to make sense.

In this case, it was because they were asked to.
