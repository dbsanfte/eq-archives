Good question. I need to do that.  BUT  with my Root  lasting a good long while
I can usually  take down a 5- 5.5k mob in about two minutes with two  bubbles
of mana.  less if there are no resists.  Typically by the time root wears off
this type of mob, he can't move because of snare and he's under a bubble HPs.

Granted sometimes the root breaks prematurely, but then  it is snared and
dotted, so I take off,  root it again on the run, and go back to medding and
freshing up the DoTs.  I confess when I get impatient I'll  hit it with a
Scoria or two, but all that does is increase my medding time.

Besides  running around kiting  jsut increases the chances of  unintentionally
training some peeps o gathering unwanted agro.

I guess I'm just  a lazy senior citizen Druid.  LOL ROF.
