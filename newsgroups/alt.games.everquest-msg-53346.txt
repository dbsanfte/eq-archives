   To tell the truth, I don't get bent out of shape if 
someone inspects me.  Really, doesn't bother me.  I 
included it because, as any google search on the subject
will show, this has been a hot topic for many people.
Also, in game, I've had several people apologize to me
for accidentally inspecting me, even though I didn't say
a word about it.  Inspecting willy-nilly, though, is
something that many people, myself included, see as a
sign of either a rank newbie, or else someone that 
wants to annoy other people.  I mean really, how hard
it is to ask first?  I think that telling someone to
not inspect other without asking is good advice, and
I stand by it.
    Also, the bit about not pissing off x, x, and x
classes.  Yes, I know that some true jerks play each
of those classes.  I didn't mean to sound as if I were
saying that if jerk_druid_008 comes up to you as you
are fighting something, and demands that you back off
because he was tracking it, you should meekly go away.
I was thinking more along the lines of demanding buffs, 
heals, or rezzes, which I also give its own rule.  
And I stand by the statement that one shouldn't make
it a habit to run around pissing people off, even if
you don't think they can help you in the future. 
I think that any class can save any other class's
bacon given the right situation, and you never know
when you might be blackballed from entering a guild
or group because you pissed off some "worthless"
SK or Mage somewhere back in  your teens.
