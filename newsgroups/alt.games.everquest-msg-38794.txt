Just wanted to chime in to agree with dstep here. If you aren't making
this character specifically to be the star in uber-mob encounters in the
50+ end game, then an SK is a great character. Warriors are great too,
but I had a blast with my SK. They are very self-sufficient and
versatile, with the spell lines they have access too: invis, invis to
undead, feign death, snares, dots, fear, lifetaps, ac/strength/atk-taps,
pets, harm touch. Get a MoSS, and you can dish out some serious damage
(that's a 19/29 +10 int one hand blunt weapon, in case you don't know).
SK's can taunt exetremely well with their spells, as well.

I agree, if you really want to be the best tanking 50+ SK you can be,
pick an ogre and dump your points into STA like a warrior would. Then
save up and get a full suit of sentient armor; that stuff will add a lot
to your int, while having slightly more AC than darkforge. But
otherwise, any race makes a fine SK; mine is a DE, and I have no
problems tanking/dishing damage in non-uber encounters.
