Don't have to offer the download option, I bought the media once, I don't
need it three more times.  If you already have a key, why not allow you to
create another account on-line, and charge your credit card directly, etc.

I'm sure it's because they never imagine people buying more than one
account (more than 8 characters per server? who on earth would need that
.......)
