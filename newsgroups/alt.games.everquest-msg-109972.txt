You do not need to double the bandwidth if you increase the graphics to
these levels.  Bandwidth is only needed to keep track of everything taking
place on the screen.  Like x monster is at x location and then moves to y
location.  Does not matter how pretty x monster looks.

Frankly, if EQ2 does get released sometime in 2003 I hope they get rid of
the zoning issue.  I played Dark Age of Camelot for awhile before switching
back to EQ and found that playing in a world where there is no "Zoning" was
a welcomed change.
