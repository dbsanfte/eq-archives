The thing is, you are trying to tell people that they cannot play the 
game anymore if they use NVidia cards, and now you come back and 
completely contradict that.  The sky is not falling, we will still be 
able to play EQ with our NVidia cards.  Personally, except on raids, I 
run with all options maxxed, and, except in PoK and the bazaar, I have no 
issues at all with the framerate.  I have no clue what my framerate is, 
the measurement is completely unimportant to me, all that matters, is 
whether or not I am happy with the playability.
