SB Live! and Audigy cards have audio problems in EQ under Win2K AND XP. As
far as I know the problem only affects the music making it skip and
stutter(that's what it does on mine). The sound effects are unnaffected so I
just turned down the music. The XP update drivers on creative's website
don't do a thing for the EQ sound issues but it does restore functionality
in XP to the software that comes with the cards.
