I won't site references, they're all hearsay anyway, but folks have reported
that when they die they don't always get everything back from their corpses
(though the corpse disappears as it should).   The one thing they all had in
common was the new UI.

The good news is that everyone I've heard of has successfully recovered
everything by /petitioning, even getting back stuff they didn't know was
missing.  So tonight I get to see if my rallic pack pattern is in the Lost &
Found bin. :p

Has anyone seen any (semi)official word on this?
