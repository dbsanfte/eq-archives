It's even sillier than you think. First time I heard that one was in rookies
in the military, one of the dipshits was told by the Corporal in charge to:

 "Run up to the guardhouse and come back and tell me what the entrance sign
says. If you get it wrong by one word you'll do it again".

To cut a long story short, 5 hours later, a sweating weeping dipshit (after
no less than about 2 dozen round trips no less) was told:

"It cannot have said anything, signs don't speak. Did I ask you what was
written on it?"

The dipshit D.O.R'ed (discharged on request) that evening, I guess he just
wasn't cut out for military life. It really does make you think more
carefully about some of the wording used everyday in common English
though....
