I wish.  We get pets at 34, 39, 44, 49, then one last one was added at 61.

I pull with slow, root the mob, DoT the mob, then let my pup worry away at
it, keeping him healed up, refreshing the DoT as needed.

Well, I don't step in where the pet left off, if a mob kills my pet, that
usually means I am at or near OOM, and low on health, as I've been canning
to get more mana.  If I see that my pet is going to bite it, I gate out, or
run to zone.  We may have more HP and AC and better combat skills than a
mage or necro, but, they still suck.  At least in the 50s, I do not find
that I can do appreciable damage.  The pup does far more melee damage than I
can ever hope to approach doing.

I have not played a Druid to high levels, but I do know that in the proper
zones (which is easy for a druid to arrange to get to), a druid will get
more xp per unit time than I will.  Druids are, situationally, better
soloers.  The two advantages a druid has  in root rotting are snare, and
DoTs that do not have a DD component that will often break root.  That makes
a huge difference on how much you will get hit.

Personally, I don't give much thought to who is the best soloer, I generally
group with friends, but I do solo at times, and know that as a shaman, I am
well equipped to do so.
