55 is not the end-all level for mages anymore. At 56, you get TRods,
which give more mana than they cost to cast. That's an enormous
advantage and was instrumental in our first Dozekar kill.

After that, I don't know. It took me forever to be able to remember
which was which between wizards and mages. Currently, my understanding
is: Mages: pets, focus items, TRods, CotH; Wizards: ports, nukes,
manaburn.
