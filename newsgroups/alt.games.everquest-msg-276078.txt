I have a dissenting experience. I started out with one last name,
picked when I just reached level 20. After, oh, I dunno, 30 levels or
so of killing mainly griffons because I enjoyed it so, I petitioned to
have my last name changed to a more fitting name, considering how I
had made it my mission in life to kill every griffon I saw. I role-
played it and, in less than a day, a GM changed it for me.
