And you are welcome to your opinions in this regard, they are yours and
so I will not dispute that you feel this way.  I won't call you a whiny
idiot or anything like that, even though I disagree.  Role-play would be
fostered if folks treated other folks like folks rather than NPCs in who
wander the landscape of their single player game.  If you had to
actually speak to someone rather than click on them to learn more about
what they are wearing a role-play opportunity has been created.  If you
sit on a bench and see I am wearing a leather coat can you tell if its a
Leather Coat AC 3 or a Leather Coat O'L33tn355 AC 33 just by looking if
they look exactly the same?  In a world of magic one might find items
that though appearing to be simple every day items, are in fact vastly
different from what they appear.  In a point and click world there is
little chance to role-play, but in a world that encouraged  you to
actually speak to folks you meet there would be more.

Then you have missed my several posts saying exactly this same thing. 
Your judgment of validity, and DT's aside, fostering role-play is a very
valid reason in my judgment, especially since the game was marketed and
sold as such a game.  The more folks claim that "no one role-plays to
speak of" the more valid this becomes.  Obviously more folks need to be
inspired.  

Now then, can you or another member of this majority that seems clear on
this subject give me a valid reason why I should be treated as an NPC?
