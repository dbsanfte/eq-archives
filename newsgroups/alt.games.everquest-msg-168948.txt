If you hunted in the pool room then yes, all change.

About 3 times the mobs including 3 that sit on top zone point, one is a
caster.
The gargoyles that sit in the room with the secret door are still there but
all the others are different, no more guardians so no more chance at a
guardian robe :ï¿½(
The mobs aren't any higher level there's just more of them, oh and there is
a wanderer the comes in, he's no tougher than any others in the pool room
but could be a nasty surprise if he turns up at the wrong moment.

Didn't explore elsewhere to see what else has changed, was only ever there
for a guardian robe not sure if any of the Guardians still spawn in any of
the other rooms.
