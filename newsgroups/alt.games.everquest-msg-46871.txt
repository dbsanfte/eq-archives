I'm pretty sure it's toggled on & off by "/pet notaunt" though maybe it's
"/pet taunt off" and "on."

Almost in every case you won't care if he's taunting, but if it's very
important for a particular person to be highest on the hate list you'll want
to turn it off.

I can't think of any other obscure commands.
