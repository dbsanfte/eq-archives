Perhaps it's part of a graphical overhaul of old-world zones, a bit like 
the pack of high-res textures that came with Luclin.

I seriously doubt there will be an EverQuest 2 as such, since we would be 
talking about double the expense (in bandwidth, hardware and staff), for 
the same revenue, as EQ2 would have the original EQ as its main 
competitor, and I doubt many people would play both.

I think that they will try to gradually evolve EQ into a more advanced 
product little by little, because, on the one hand, it's the richness of 
content that sells Everquest, and that would be really hard to achieve 
with a new product off the bat, and also because as it is now, they have 
a pretty much captive audience for any expansion packs and enhancements 
that they care to put out.
