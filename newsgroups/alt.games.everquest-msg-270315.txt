<snip the download story>
There are plenty of free bittorrent clients out there. I prefer Azureus
myself. It seems like this is the choice you have to make nowadays. As a
matter of fact the WoW patch client is torrent based from what I've read.
If you're a heavy .torrent user you will be able to download faster (that's
my own take on it) sort of like the emule client rating you higher the more
you transfer.

Now I've done some p2p in the past but I'm very wary of using *any* p2p
client to do game patching. I know that when I patch NWN it goes to a
Bioware ftp server. I have *no* clue when using a torrent where exactly
that file is coming from. It could be a "spoofed" torrent for all I know
and is infecting my entire family with the ebola virus. I just really worry
about security with them. 

I also believe that companies are "cheaping out" as a recent trend. I guess
they figure "we got you to buy the game then we can get you to host our
patches." That worries me because what else will they cut back on. Lord
knows the software they're pushing out the door isn't finished. Where else
will they cut corners?

I think it's a good thing that Funcom is giving away the client. I'm apt to
agree with you that the community there will look at it as attracting "new
blood". When I played everyone was very friendly and helpful. I might give
it a try again - I'm kind of torn now. I was most likely going to get the
new Catacombs expansion for DAoC but since this is free I might just go AO
for a bit.
