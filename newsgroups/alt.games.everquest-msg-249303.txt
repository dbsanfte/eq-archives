Is it just me or is anyone else still waiting for the Pres to sent me this
or any email explaining his position.  As anyone who uses email regularly,
it is just as easy to send an email to All Users(ie registered EQ Players)
as it is to send to one to a Usenet newsgroup.  I would estimate that less
than half of the EQ users know about alt.games.everquest.  Less than 10%
read it regularly and far less than 1% post messages.

So when I see an email directly from the President of SOE in my EQ
registered mailbox, then maybe I could possibly start to have an impression
that it might be a priority for SOE to attempt to fix problems, maybe.
