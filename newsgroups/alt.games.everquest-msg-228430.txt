Well I figured you were elemental flagged but i wasn't sure
VP is a dungeon  a lot of people missed back in the day.. and can't be
bothered doing the quest now, with such subpar loot.
VT.. all depends when your guild became serious at the high end.
A lot of guilds who dominated velious and early SoL are generally dripping
in VT armour.. but a lot of recent powerhouse guilds going thru the phases
are skipping VT for faster progression

PoTime A is basically a gathering place for the raid. It has portals to the
different trials (PoTimeB) and the GY (PoTimeB).. no killing etc happens
here, no extra keys etc
