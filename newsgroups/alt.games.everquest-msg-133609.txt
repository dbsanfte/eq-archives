Taking a quick glance at spell lists.  Looks like, Enchanter 20+, 29 is nice
for Clarity.  Wizard can start earlier than the others, they get a wide
range of AoE damage spells starting at level 1.  Mage 24+, they get their
second PB AoE at 24, first one at level 4.  Cleric is basically there to
heal, but does get a PB AoE at 19, another at 29, and an AoE heal at 34
(group only?).  As for puller, he needs to be big enough and fast enough to
survive bringing in a boatload of mobs.
