Well that is the nutshell of the argument. How much damage is actually lost
from going to the lowerlevel pet vs. how much mana has to be used to heal
in the longer rooted mob fight.

Huh? what difference does the agro make? The point is the mob is NOT
running while rooted and attacking 'someone.'

Sure if the mobs don't run anyway like undead or those spiders then use
the earth pet. But we are talking about the other 90% of mobs that are
single pulled and run when they get low.

Maybe I am missing something but what he is talking about is the last
part of a fight when most mobs are running and not attacking that is saving
the damage. If you root the mob it continues to fight until death therefore
doing more damage that the cleric has to heal.
