I played a cleric full time for a year and a bit (not just playing a friends
char..) and in the begining I was "nice" enough to respond to every tell I
got..which gets very very tiresome. You call me a coward for not responding
to the endless tells, which I don't mind, that's your opinion and you can't
really be a judge over what I do until you play a cleric capable of rezzing
for a good amount of time. People got the hint that I was busy and didn't
continue the spam as they used to when I said no and they were determined to
get a rez. You were right though, I do avoid it but only to make my play
time more enjoyable, after idiot_98 spams for a rez then proceeds to argue
that it would only take a few mins I get fed up and end up in a bad mood so
now I ignore them if I'm busy and continue to play and enjoy it.

Well from the other point of view the last thing a cleric wants to tolerate
is someone sending a tell for a rez when they are in the middle of a fight.
So yes I suppose I'm "rude" since I tend to worry more about keeping my
groups alive and I'm "rude" for trying to keep the players in my groups
having fun without my b*tching and moaning about endless tells for rezzes.
As for the whole donation bit, not once have I asked for a donation, if
people offer then yes I will accept it. The way i look at it is the only
time I am willing to go rez people is when i am not busy and so they aren't
really using up my valuable time or pulling me away from a good group.
