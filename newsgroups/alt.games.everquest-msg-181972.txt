    No, you've misread or I've miscommunicated. The Decorins, the mobs you
need to gank to start things, repop 20 minutes after a failed go at RZ. They
were not repopping 20 minutes after a successful kill. So unlike Emperor,
where if you blow it you need to wait hours to go again, by the time you've
ressed up and cleared back to the Decorins they're back up again.

    Snip a lot of stuff resulting from that miscommunication.

    Not every guild, Martin. I recently got three server-wide firsts in
Tailoring. Based on other pieces that had been made, and the clear pattern
in the stats, I knew the pieces I was making were not optimal compared to
other things I could make. I made them anyways, to be the first to make
them. My guild feels the same way about content as I do. We're not here to
farm and make our Magelos look good. Farming is only a means to an end, and
is discarded as soon as possible. I even suggested a few months ago that we
farm the AoW to rebuild the guild bank (a previous guild leader had E-Bay'ed
most of the guild bank, leaving it pretty barren). The answer was clear:
that takes away from our progress towards the endgame, so no. If we wouldn't
spare one hour per five days to get easy cash....

    Yeah, and it's disappointing too. Lots of dysfunction in game related to
people being able to turn in-game stuff into cash.

    My guildmates are a little more upset about zerging than I am. But you
should read those posts again, especially the ones by Gimick. He was quite
good at keeping the emotion out of his posts and focussing on what was
really wrong about what happened.
