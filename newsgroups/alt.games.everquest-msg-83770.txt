Hard to believe or not, it's true.

Are you sure about this?  You might want to check your logs, I'm sure 
you're find that it was many, many months ago.

When?  How long ago?  Are you sure you weren't reviving real corpses that 
had previously been giving a real exp rez?

Feel free to do so, just make sure you're bound near by.  It will be hard 
to repeat if each attempt took you 2 hours because you had to run across 
the world.

Now this is a bug, one that has popped up in this newsgroup several times 
before.  If you notice this, camp out and come back.  Oh, it may help to 
find a buff with a short duration, cast it, time it, then /bug it.

Not at all.  If there were a 3 hour limit you all go to VP and kill stuff 
until you're tired of doing so.  You then duel and die.  You pop up at 
your bind point nekkid, there is a cleric at your bind point.  You duel 
and die again, leaving a nekkid corpse at your bind point.  The cleric or 
pally in VP casts revive on your corpse (well, actually most likely clicks 
you with his noodle), you pop up at your corpse in VP, loot it, then the 
cleric or pally at your bind point clicks your nekkid corpse.  Voila!  
Painfree VP extraction.  
With the three minute timer you *can* do it with duels, but you're taking 
a huge risk.  A problem loading the zone, a disconnect, anything, and the 
corpses age out.  We have been fairly successful dueling at bind-point 
after a death in battle, but this is only used when someone has to leave 
during a raid, and slows down the raid since we have to have the 
bind-point reviver there, with revive loaded and the corpse targetted, and 
ready to cast it immediately upon being given the word, AND have the rez 
cleric sitting on the VP corpse ready to click immediately.  As soon as 
you die in the duel, the cleric clicks you, you pop up at your corpse, 
loot as quickly as you can, and sent a tell to the reviver, who must 
immediately revive you.  The only time we use duels is when the character 
is bound at a bank or a vendor and needs to get something or the raid will 
not continue.  Duel, die, get the stuff, get revived back.  
The discussion so far has centered on VP, because any guild hunting in VP 
will have to rez out several times until they learn the zones, and even 
when you know it and how to kill the mobs, sometimes they just kick your 
butt anyway.  There is one other zone where you often make a corpse to 
help move the raid along, and that is Plane of Sky. 
If you want to join a Sky raid late (or if there are more than 24 people 
there and you don't want to wait 8 hours for more keys) you die to a mob 
on isle 1, pop up at bind point, get rezzed back by a cleric, loot but 
leave an item on your corpse, join the ghetto-CoH (Call of the Fallen Hero 
is our name for it) group, have your corpse summoned to the higher island 
by the necro, and then get a revive by a cleric or pally.
