EQ2 was a terrible concept from the start.  Regardless of whatever game
mechanics I don't like about the game, regardless of...  well, anything... 
it was aimed at essentially the same market.  The right way to do that is to
take one of two possible paths:

A) Create a *different* game.  Name it something else.  Don't make it depend
on cannibalizing your own successful product's userbase in order to succeed
itself.  Yes, it will still draw on some of the same userbase, but not as
heavily, and all those "EQ sucks" people (like yourself) don't refuse to
even try it based on preconceptions.

B) Re-create EQ.  Make it the same game, completely new engine.  Shutdown EQ
and transfer everyone to EQ2, which *is* EQ, just with a complete overhaul. 
Market it as a brand new game, enjoy the benefits of a pre-existing
userbase.

Instead they tried to create a sequel.  A mind bogglingly bad idea. 
Asheron's Call 2, in every way a far superior game to Asheron's Call,
flopped with a vengeance.  Pay attention.   =P
