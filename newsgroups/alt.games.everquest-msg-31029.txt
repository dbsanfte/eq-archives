That's the part I don't understand. Really. "man vs. machine" is like
"bird vs. nest" or "beaver vs. dam". Making machines is what we *do*.
It's us; it's pretty much what defines us as a species. That anybody can
take such an antagonistic attitude towards what makes them human is
beyond my comprehension.

Absolutely true. Which does not mean that they won't some day, or that
it will somehow demean humanity if they do.
