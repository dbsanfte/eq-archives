Let me tell you in plain terms:

The next time I see Bait Masterson masturbating in the zone with that
painfully stupid name, or when I see brilliant and creative PC names
ripped from 55+ multi-year players, or there's yet another GM event
wherein anyone under 60 gets slaughtered just because they were in the
wrong zone..

The next time I try a quest and lose my items because they haven't
fixed it since the day it went in 18 months ago, or the ONLY place I
can find out about what my spell does is not by asking my guild-master
in town but on some Web page..

The next time I hear someone shout out their GEMS score..

Fix those out-of-place elements, fix those things which are NOT role
play..

Then they will have earned the right to Role Play events and expect
people to not whizz all over them.

These things have to be earned, and Verant has had a long history of
being flippant and ineffectual at coming up with in-game RPG content.

Earn it, baby; treat the people like you want to be treated Verant!
You love us, and we'll love you !  ^_^
