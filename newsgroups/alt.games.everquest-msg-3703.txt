You have hit the old (pre 50) cap. When Kunark came out, and level
51-60 characters, they raised the upper limits on most skills.
However, you do not gain the ability to increase these skills until
you ding 51. Therefore, for most players in most skills, you cap
around level 40 and have no increases for 10 levels. Also, I think the
chart you looked at was out of date, didn't they increase ranger
offensive skills to equal warriors (250)? Or was that just the Offence
skill itself...
