I suppose you could take the advice as a guideline, not a rule, although:

When I was studying creative writing, we were taught that to imply an
accent, speech impediment, regional dialect, etc. that we should add an
_occasional_ misspelling, usually at the end of a phrase

implies that he was taught "this is the way" and not "this is a possible and
often sufficient way".  Also consider that the phrase that originally
brought on the criticism was "Me no have the majiks,"  which has only one
misspelled word combined with some nonstandard grammar.  That doesn't imply
that the people who disagreed with that statement have very much room in
their small brains for variance on their theories.
