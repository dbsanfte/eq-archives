Heh... I appreciate all the good advice...  I guess right now, I'll work on
pottery... I know several enchanters and rogues in my guild that would
appreciate it...  And I wasn't meaning to disrespect Half-Elves...  It's
just anytime I tell anyone I'm a half-elven Druid, they always say "I'm
sorry", or "Should have gone with Halfling or Wood Elf" or something like
that... LOL...  If I didn't like my Druid, I'd have given up on him a long
time ago... :)
