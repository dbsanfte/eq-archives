Its oot and south ro, not karana. The south ro one supposedly has some
goofy circuit you do like kill everything around on the sand (except
you don't need to kill the dervs or static dark elf vendors, orctallus
or that guy.. basically only wandering spawning things) The thing is
the south ro one can't really be camped because several people are
always trying to spawn it and get it and it can pop up pretty much
anywhere so is first come first serve, its also like level 30 or
something so dies fast. 

Rumor I heard was you see what the spawn is in that lil open tower
thing on the sand and kill all of the spawns like it, another
variation says that and all spiders. Basically its run around and kill
lots of stuff, pack a lunch, bring some friends, chime in when someone
asks if its camped with the 15 other people in the zone who answer
"yes." 

For a short time it was spawning in East karana A LOT when you killed
the named giant there or other junk or something. They fixed that
pretty rapidly but some people got the ring for jboots in the meantime
;)

Meanwhile if you do the spawn in OOT you'd need a druid around level
49 or someone similar, or several characters like a cleric and maybe
another tank (sk would be nice then the sk could fear and help beat on
it) or pet classes. Druid or shaman friend is nice though since they
are not as apt to want the jboots ;)
