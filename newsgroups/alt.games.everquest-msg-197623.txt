34 - Ice Spear 3.2 sec cast - 150dam/50mana - 30second recast
49 - Frost Shard 3.2 sec cast - 300dam/100 mana - 30 second recast
54 - Ice Shard 3.2 sec cast - 450dam/150 mana - 30 second recast

All much better than the ones you posted (3:1 ratio)

Mage - level 60, Shock of Fiery Blades
6.3 second cast, 1005dam/334mana or 3.01:1 ratio

Now, I sure don't see these in the shaman list.  And the ONLY
way I get better mana efficiency from SoFB is specialization.

So, revisting my original statement - they have the same base
mana efficiency as the level 60 spell from a nuking class - 
that makes them astoundingly efficient.  So, cancel "For a
hybrid."
