On Thursday, August 9, 2007 at 5:00 am PDT (6:00 am MDT, 7:00 am CDT, 
8:00 am EDT, -7.00 GMT), all EverQuest servers will be down for a 
Hotfix. The estimated downtime is 5 hours.Oops I accidently put 10 hours 
instead of 5 hours for the downtime. The up time is around 10am PDT ~ 
Zatozia

is the official message on the forum page.

The updates page on the other hand, at
http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/game_updates.vm

has this to say:
Upcoming Updates 	
	
	
	
	We currently do not have information about the next Game Update.

Yep, they not only know nothing about today's update, but they don't 
even know that there was one on 7/31!

http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/network_status.vm

Knows there's an update today and lists all servers as down.  But they 
also say

Scheduled EverQuest Server Maintenance - 08/09/2007 5:00 am
Downtime Update
All EverQuest servers will be coming down at 5:00 AM PDT (-7 UTC) on 
Thursday 08/09/2007 for an update. Estimated downtime is 5 hours.

The EverQuest Operations Team

So its SCHEDULED and you don't know what its going to cover?  I mean, if 
  this was something off the cuff, an emergency repair to one of the 
many bugs they introduced with the previous few patches, I could see not 
knowing what was going on.

But no information, in either of the obvious locations, nor in the 
secret hidden who would guess you have to go look in the bathroom stall 
to find the info location?  It just boggles the mind.
