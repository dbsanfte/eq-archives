A lot of software companies have tried, unsuccessfully, to say the same
thing about the software you buy.  Read the end user license agreement on
just about any software you buy, you will likely find that they state they
retain full ownership, and you are merely purchasing a license to use the
software.  Here in the US, it has been ruled numerous times, that they
cannot restrict you from reselling your software, so long as you do not
retain a copy, despite what the licensing agreement says.  Not saying this
applies to how Sony does it with the accounts, I have never heard of any
case that has actually made it through the courts regarding something like
that.
