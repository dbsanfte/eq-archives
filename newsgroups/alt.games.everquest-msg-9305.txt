Whatever race you find most interesting. Period.

I have a wood elf warrior. Gnomes are cute, and so are halflings. Ogres
and trolls have nice features that make being a warrior very easy.
Barbies are large and Good, but nightblind. Iksars get tail attack. Be
whomever you want to be. I don't think that any of the races *can't* be
a warrior.
