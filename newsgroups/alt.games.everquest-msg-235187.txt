It happens because they dont test adequately.  How did favor work in the
beta?  No one noticed items that sold for a few plat to vendor and had no
real worth in the player economy were cranking bank 1-2K favor points?  I
dont buy that unless favor didnt work the same way it did on the Live
servers.

At what point does SOE treat this like a business?  EQ has 500K subscribers?
That is a ton of revenue they are generating every month and it damn sure
doesnt show in the product.
