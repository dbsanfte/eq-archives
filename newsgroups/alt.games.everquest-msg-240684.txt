They did put out some CDs - aware some people werent on broadband and so
would wait for a later CD rather than download. Didn't amazon sell some -
hang on I'll check (yup they have it as a discontinued/unavailable item) -
it got mentioned in the blurb around launch time IIRC. 

Getting it now is likely to be a case of find older supply. With most US
games that gives us in the UK (as the OP was) a bit of a longer window
before the stock goes.

Possibly, amazon.co.uk only hold a pack that includes up to Luclin, then
it has LDON and GoD and PoP as seperates....can't speak for the rest of
Europe.

Yup if its a cash/fraud issue this company already has your details
anyway...if its a safe software thats clean issue then they download the
master copies to you routinely....
