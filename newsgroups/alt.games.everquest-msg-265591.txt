Interesting, but I disagree with much of his conclusions. He slams 
instancing, but fails to comeup with a solution that instancing solves - 
which is camps, kill stealing, trains, camp fights, and all the usual.

I is apparently for perma-death, but totally fails to realize that one of 
the major effects of perma-death in games is that people play it totally 
safe, to avoid death at all costs.

Many of his other conclusions have similar failures.
