The AC offered by armor (AC) is NOT the same as the Armor Class statistic (DEF)
you see on your character info screen. Armor, your Defense skill and your
Agility are factored to create you DEF. Each class has a multiplier used to
calculate how much your DEF will increase for each AC you add: a warrior who
adds 1 AC will see a higher increase in DEF than a wizard who does the same. And
I think level plays a part, as well (a 40th level character will see more DEF
for each AC than a 10th level character.)

After all that, it is your DEF that directly influences combat. It would appear
that a critter will be hit based on a formula of your Attack statistic (ATK) and
its DEF; you will be hit based on a formula of your DEF and its ATK. Basically,
the higher your DEF in relation to the critter's ATK, the less you will get hit.
(ATK seems to be figured on your level, your Attack skill and your proficiency
with whatever weapon you have equipped.)

At level 15, the difference that extra AC makes is probably not too significant;
the level multiplier and your Defense skill will not increase your DEF very
much. By 20th level, the difference will be very visible.

It sounds like you are doing pretty well. You may wish to get some wisdom items;
most rangers dumped their starting stats in to strength and stamina and left
wisdom to rot. For rangers, higher wisdom will mean extra mana and silver jasper
rings (+2 WIS) are pretty cheap.
