Eh?

My question wasn't  "who came first, Sony or Lotr Producers", but
rather whether they have a common source for the design of the blade vs.
if I have the right to point a finger at Sony and call them thieves (if I
wanted to...doesn't really bother me if they liked gimli's axe).

In no way, shape, or form do I think the LotR movie makers got inspiration
from PoP!  *shudders at the thought*
