Hi,

I have recently started a necro in the hopes of exploring the warrens
and stonebrunt mnts. and I was wondering if anyone had any tips on
hunting there. 

I have read the previous threads here reffering to low heath critters
wandering off and causing trains, and various semi-rants on badly
designed dungeons. What I want to know is has anyone actually hunted
there for a few levels with reasonable level chars ? 

Oh and what level should I be before I go there ? 
(I'm level 5 atm and hunting in toxx, could it be any darker ?)

Thanks for any hints / guides etc.

Please no "don't even bother" replies, I'm going to hunt there, I just
want to be prepaired.

Cheers again,

Jim
