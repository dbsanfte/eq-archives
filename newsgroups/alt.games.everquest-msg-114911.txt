There is at least three orc pawn pick quests, the Militia one in WC, the 
Warriors guild in WF, and an often overlooked one in EF. The other two you 
already know about so I won't talk about them. The quest in EF is a great 
way to raise faction with the Knights of Truth. It has no negative faction 
adjustments. *None*. That get your attention? ;-) The only drawback is that 
you have to find orc pawn picks, lots and lots of them. The Knights of 
Truth faction adjustment is very small. But orc pawn picks are easy to get 
if you are willing to hunt orc pawns (which also increases your Knights of 
Truth faction), or spend some money buying them from merchants near the 
Newbie area at the west gate. (I bought 20 from Boomba the Big once. Be 
warned, he will ream you on the price. It wasn't really that much but was 
far more than they were worth.)
