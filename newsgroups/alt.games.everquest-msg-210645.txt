Not in Agility *cough*

EQ Casters realm suggests 25pnts in stamina for all Warriors...I suggest
sticking at least 5pnts into Strength, your 70 strength will make life a
little hard with encumbrance. If the character is (going to be) twinked this
isn't that much of a problem as Str gear is readily available but if you're
going to be wearing none stat and heavy armour, like Bronze, you my find
yourself encumbered before you leave the house, so to speak.

You're no different from any other Warrior, obviously you won't have as many
HP as the larger, stronger races (Who will all have higher stamina) or even
the smaller stronger races....In fact Teir'dal are physically the weakest of
all Warrior races by someway but you will still be doing the same job and
still want the same items, AC, HP and Stamina.

I'd suggest going agnostic, serving Inny as a warrior doesn't seem to
provide to many bonuses, unless you are doing it for RP reasons.
Teir'dal Regent armour (no deity) as pretty much as good as Dark Prince
Regent (inny) armour,  you lose +5agil off the BP and Wis/Int stats off the
other pieces but you aren't short on Wis/Int and even if you were, you don't
need them. Agnostic means you will be dubious to humans (and I think
Dwarves) other Elves and Halflings will pretty much hate you still but being
tolerated in Human cities is a help (with PoP, faction doesn't really have
much effect anymore) and it doesn't take long to kill enough orcs or gnolls
to have the humans welcome you with open arms.
There are some items which are better for Inny worshippers than Agnostics,
Hateful Honed blade of Ykesha is slightly better (1 less delay and +5 dex)
to the normal Honed Blade of Ykesha but other than that I am hard pushed to
think of anything else I ever looked at and though "Damn Wish I worshipped
Inny now"

Not much else to say, Dark Elf is a poor choice for a Warrior but it's good
to see someone wanting to play something not by the numbers and not asking
the usual "What is the best race to play for XXXX class?"
Good Luck
