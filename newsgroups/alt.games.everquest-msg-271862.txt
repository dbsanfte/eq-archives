I'll second that Michael! Being unable to find a replacement 
for EQ so far, I got my nephew started with EQ Platinum and 
OoW for Christmas. He's away at University, so it also 
affords a great opportunity to keep in touch. First thing I 
did was link him to the FAQ and it has indeed made him a 
much better newbie than he otherwise would have been.

Great work Don!
