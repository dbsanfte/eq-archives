 Wel I haven't played any TSS (won't buy expansion and probally done
with EQ thanks to WoW) but I'd say its more fun than nostalgia.
Learning to single pull the mobs at the bottom of the stairs then
dealing with the 3 of them (2 staic and 1 roamer you almost never see)

banshee on the pedastal is amusing.
