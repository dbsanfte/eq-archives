We've never done the ring of fire (ASAIK), so totally new to ring based
events.

We tried him for the first time last week, got to wave 6 on our first try..
Im not overly clued up on the encounter though.. are we close?  Still only
half way? Way more to go?

After the wipe it got really buggy though, we tried to start the ring again
but nothing would spawn.. hmm its busted.  Some people leave (gate), the
rest walk out of the thing.. and low and behold, the damn thing suddenly
spawns again.

Lets just hope its not the same story as the AoW... our first attempt on him
bettered all the other Prexus guilds first few attempts asaik ( The
A\____________ ) compared to their 60-90%'s.. and well, they have killed it
now but we haven't :(

Oh man your clutching at straws if your relying on Sontalak dropping your
spells.  How long does he live on your server now?

Other than 12 bored manaburn wizzies... Sont doesn't die anymore on Prexus
(well unless you count the 1 group who tried to take him, using melaf as the
tank..)

He doesn't have much HP so its a short fight.. if the reward is there why do
so many people ignore him?

Well I can understand that, especially for primal.  Were at around 60 ST
keys (excluding retired/inactive/ex members) so have a pretty good damage
crew.. none of the new recruits have one though (obviously)

ST is a really easy place to burn out on though, its already been a regular
target (every, or close to every pop for over 7 months) so its sometimes
hard carrying on with the Broods/ST.

On one side your new members "need" (want) primal.. on the other side, some
people have worked tirelessly every other day for over 7 months (the first
5months or so were all around 7am EST too)

Well yeah, but as an example.. Vindi and Statue.   Most people would agree
Statue is a much much tougher mob.. (a guild whos just at the level to kill
VIndi could not kill the Statue)

I've seen us wipe on Vindi within the last month though... don't recall a
time that we have lost to Statue.  Admittedly Vindi is mostly a half assed
attempt nowadays, and he does drop guaranteed... but he can wipe a raid out
much easier than Statue

As for special strategy needed for the pull.. well I guess Dain would be the
Velious mob to fit into this category... but just because hes a SON OF A
BITCH to pull, I don't think it makes him a tougher mob/tougher encounter.
Its more luck than anything else really
