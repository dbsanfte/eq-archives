My Computer -> Manage -> services -> locate "Universal Plug and Play",
stop the service and set "start up" to "manual".

Shutdown, power cycle the router, boot back up.

With luck your pc should revert back to normal, will pick up an ip
address from the gateway via dhcp, and you'll be able to connect to
the net. If not, run the network setup wizard and make sure to say you
connect via a residential gateway.

Best of luck.

You aren't googling 'linksys' 'everquest'... are you? ;)

Could be a design flaw or a firmware bug... but most people have no
trouble with eq + linksys so there is more too it than that... I
generally suspect Windows issues over Hardware firmware/issues in
absence of solid evidence to the contrary.
