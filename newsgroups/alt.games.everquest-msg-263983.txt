I spent a huge amount of time playing in EW, soloing with my druid, or
duoing with my wife's druid.  I could run from the iceclad portal to
the bridge blindfolded in a snowstorm.  I quickly learned that the
calls to "do the BS room" were usually the last words you heard before
you were doing a corpse retrieval.

What a great zone.
