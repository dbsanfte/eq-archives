And the armor class doesnt, which is the important thing.

See my response to switching it.   All caster mobs melee too.  You're probably
losing more HP from thier increased melee damage than you're saving from
increased protection against magic attacks only...  especially since there
aren't very many mobs at all that just use magic attacks.

Which was why I suggested an alternate item almost as good as the crafted that
he could camp himself much easier, or buy for much cheaper.   Crested spalders
are dirt cheap and all over the place.

Which is his choice.   I could go around wearing leather armor at 50, and
claim that that means leather armor is good protection for a level 50 warrior,
since everything else is too hard to get..  The item I mentioned above is a
short easy camp for a group of 30's.   If he doesn't want to do even that....

Then he was leeching off the other members of the group, which probably
included several level 50+ farmers.  The elites and the chief will be deep
red, and a 38 won't be hitting them enough to matter.     I may have been
overshooting a bit with 45.   IIRC, 42 ish is probably close enough.

Yes, stats are meaningless.   If you're having a problem with your weight,
start looking for lighter armor.  Or pass on the coppers and silvers every so
often...

And how many times do you get nuked, compared to the amount that you get
meleed?

Resists are nice, but they're not worth giving up AC for, until the very end
game.
