hi guys and gals!
have been playing like mad pretty much all weekend, but can't stay connected
for much more than an hour, hour and a half tops.  and it's a hard crash...i
have to hit my reset button to get my pc back.  went to sony's site
everquest site, and it told me if i'm having troubles staying connected with
my cable modem, to check and see if my soundcard and/or videocard is sharing
an IRQ with my network card...and damned if it ain't!  sb live' value is on
9...and so are both my NICs (i'm using this computer as an ICS sharing
server for two other PCs...already troubleshot that tho by disabling
ICS...and it still crashed).  so i'm thinking i'll move the sblive to either
7 or 10...other stuff there, but not the vid card or NICs, so maybe that'll
clear things up.  but damned if the windows system device manager won't let
me manually assign an IRQ...any advice"
tia,
steve rennick aka mildred the MALE dwarf warrior on ayonae-ro...
