True, the list was almost in order of usefullness (actually in raid
usefulness), +atk means less to a beastlord than a ranger / monk / rogue as
there PRIMARY damage output is from their pet (who cannot equip the epic
:P), and there melee is not great (until AA improvements).

Also, the beastlord (im led to believe), is one of the easier epics to
complete.
