I agree, the word TRAIN has a special attention grabbing quality to it that
pierces zone chatter, and should be used even when the train might not be
serious to the people that are about to get hit by it.

If you want to make a seperate button for tiny trains compared to serious
freight, then you can do so while still including the word train:

How about this

TRAIN hotkey
/shout Major TRAIN coming to a zone line near you, %t and more

CABOOSE hotkey
/shout TRAIN coming, actually just one or two %t, maybe its a CABOOSE

Something like that, and you hit the appropriate one as needed.

You can actually have tons of social hotkeys if you use one of the social banks
for them and use your cursor to click them instead of dragging them all to
hotkey banks.  Then you could include which zone line you are heading for, why
you are running, so on and so forth.  Don't try this if you use mouselook to
steer with though!
