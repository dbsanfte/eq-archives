Everyone who ever went to eqatlas.com already has better maps than that book,
along with quests, mob and strategy information.   I received the atlas book as
a gift.  It sits on a shelf, along with the other Prima books.  
I still wish eqatlas.com would print their OWN map book.  Count me *in* for a
copy of it.
