At early part of a tradeskill, it typically goes up pretty quickly.  I 
would highly recommend getting some cheap gear to raise your Wisdom or 
your Int, whichever you can do cheaper.  Also, see if you can't get an 
enchanter to give you a Int/Wis buff.  The higher you can get one of 
those, the more skill increases you will get.  For smithing, Strength is 
an alternate stat that can be used insted of Int or Wis.  For fletching, 
I think Dex is supposed to be an alternate stat, but I don't recall for 
certain if that is indeed working, or even the case.

At level 12 I got my ranger up to 203 fletching, cost me less than 1k 
plat to get that far.  His wisdom at the time was 145 or so.  The cost to 
do fletching goes up a fair amount as you get to higher skill levels.
