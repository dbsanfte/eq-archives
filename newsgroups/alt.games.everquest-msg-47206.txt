With all due respect to Clint and Halfpole, please do *NOT* listent to
them and try to go hunt the spiders at Erud's Crossing (a.k.a. "wisp
island") at level 10.  Two very solid reasons for this:

First, back when I was playing my monk I was advancing tailoring like
you, and was always looking for silk. I wish I still had that notebook,
but I started doing a survey of sorts, recording each of all the various
types of spiders we hunted, and how many silks they dropped on each kill
to come up with an average. We hunted, over the course of many levels,
more than a half dozen types of spiders in different locations and I got
averages for a minimum of fifty kills on each. The wisp island spiders
drop the LEAST silk of ANY species I've found on Norrath. Well below
half of what some of the higher silk producing species will give up.

Second, you're level ten, right? If hunt hunt those spiders right now
you're going to get your ass handed to you on a platter. For their
level, they are some of the harder hitting bugs you'll run into, and
their poison is *NASTY* for level ten to fifteen characters. (six HP per
tick comes to mind, and long lasting.) Also, they are extrememly social,
come in large numbers and have a massive aggro radius. You can be
fighting one spider, and unless your technique is very solid, you can
quickly have four or five on you. I died more there than I care to
remember with those stupid spiders.

The other suggestions of Commons and Everfrost are probably much better
for you now. The best silk drops in the game are to be found in either
the Heart Spider caves of upper Guk (my personal favorite) or the Craig
Spiders that roam EK (though hunting them can take longer.) Both, sadly,
are still too high level for you for some levels to come.
