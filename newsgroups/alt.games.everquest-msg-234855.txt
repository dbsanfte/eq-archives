This post started as a reply to another thread, then mutated into a
discussion of Bardwork in general.  I thought it deserved it's own thread -
egotistical, ain't I?  Another hallmark of the Bard...

Scott,

First off - it's not about being as good, or better, or not as good as an EQ
player as anyone else.  It's about having fun.  If that kind of focus and
concentration isn't fun for you, don't do it!  I'm not trying to get you
down on yourself - I'm encouraging you to either be the best bard you can,
or do something else.

Being a bard requires *constant* focus and attention, and you pray for the
cleric to say "oom" so you can take a rest to go to the bathroom.  /grin  If
that's not what  you're into, play another class.  When I'm playing my mage,
for example, I have no problem with waiting for a pull to come in, assisting
the MT, sending in the pet, recasting the MT's damage shield, making sure
the cleric has a modrod, and saying "BRB" and getting a soda, coming back
and deciding whether this mob deserves a nuke.  Very laid back, low key
play - perfect for those days I've had a suck day at work.  That doesn't
make me a suck mage - actually, I think I'm a pretty good mage - it's a
completely different type of play.

I don't recommend autotwisting hotkeys, btw.  They lock you into doing just
one thing for the duration of the twist, and a bard's hallmark is
flexibility.  A single-twist key reduces your key presses by half, but I
still don't recommend it because you're locked into doing that one song for
three seconds, and I've had more than one occasion that I've had to stop the
song I was starting to do something else.  Has anyone mentioned mapping your
songs to the numbers across the top of your keyboard?  That way you're not
mousing the gems, it's just 1,1,2,2,3,3 with your fingers across the top of
the key row and you don't have to move your hands as much.

Take my example of the other day.  My setup was:
1: Lull song
2: Haste/Damage Shield song
3: Heal/Manasong
4: Snare/Slow song
5: Damage Shield song
6: Mezz song
7: Disease/Poison Resist song
8: Disease/Poison Cure song
9: Detect Trap/Disarm Trap hotkey
10: Pull Incoming hotkey

Let's say I was going to pull a room.  I've got Healsong up, because I'm
probably still dented from the last fight.  I go forward (tapping 9 to avoid
any traps) and see 3 mobs in the room.  Target a mob, start Lull, target
next mob (before the song even goes off), first mob is Lulled, stop/start
Lullsong to lull second mob, target the one I'm going to pull (again, before
song starts), Lull song hits, Stop lull/start snaresong, hit 0 so the group
knows what I'm bringing in, and I'm backing out of the room before the
snaresong hits.  (Side note: I prefer to pull with a song that doesn't slow
the mob on incoming like the Jolt song, but hey, gotta work with just 8
gems).  As soon as snare hits I start Disease/Poison resist in case it's a
caster (we were in Mistmoore, lots of necros there) and before the mob's
spell hits my resists are up (if it's a caster).

By now I'm back at the group and it's time to run Haste song for the melee
types, then drop into the regular 2,3,4 twist.  If the mob wasn't
snareable/slowable, I'll use 2,3,5 to boost the damage shield more - if I
can't slow it, make it pay!  If it's a caster, I'll stretch my hands a bit
and do 2,5,7 to get our group resists up high while keeping haste going (the
DS song I use has fire resist built in, that's the most common thing besides
disease and poison for a necro).  If the fight is getting tough I'll really
focus on my timing and do a four-twist - say, 2,4,5,7 for haste,
damage/sheilds and resist, and slow/snare the mob for a SK who has
significant melee as well as nasty spells.

Naturally, if we end up with a wanderer or overpull (hey, I'm not perfect) I
mezz to get the mobs under control.  If there are 3 mobs, I only mezz; if 2
mobs, I'll put haste back in the mix (remember group had 2 warriors and a
rogue, most of our damage was mellee) and if only 1 mob I'll mezz, haste,
and heal/manasong.  Yes, I know one of the warriors could have offtanked;
you tell them.  A bard's job is filling in a group's lacks, including an SA
too slow to offtank.

If the fight is going well, I'll hit a final pulse of slow/snare and turn
off attack and head back to the pull area for the next around 30 pct.  That
usually lets me bring in the next mob about 2 seconds after the last died,
plenty of time for the MT to assist me for target.  If the fight is starting
to suck (say, we get a mob that can heal itself) I'll stay and use Mezz song
to interrupt it's casting.  I'll also ask in group if anyone was poisoned or
diseased during the fight and cure them - if I get poisoned, I just cure
myself on the way out to the pull area.  (I thought the cleric was a bit
lazy not doing the cures herself, but wth.  I would have had cure song up
anyway for any surprise traps I encountered while pulling.)

As you see from this rather long-winded discussion, it's possible to be a
quite competent bard just twisting three songs, four once in a while if
things get sticky.  Was I playing at my full potential?  Not really, I could
have four-twisted all night.  But it wasn't needed.  A careful choice of
songs, placing the songs in such a way that you don't have to wreck your
hand to reach them,  and the ability to react to the changing situation let
me do my job, and do it pretty well (in my less-than-humble opinion).

Try out the fingerings I've talked about above, using all of the fingers on
your left hand - even the broadest, 2,4,5,7, isn't difficult.  Index finger
on 7, middle and ring on 5 and 4, little finger on 2.  Put the songs you use
often in the middle and the songs you don't use in combination with the
others on the ends (Lull and Cure, in this instance) and twisting gets much
simpler.

All the above being said - again, play a class that's the most fun for you.
If you want to be constantly shifting what you do, be a bard.  If you want
that life-or-death, 'everything depends on me' rush, play a cleric or
enchanter.  Want the limelight, right in front of the mob, everyone follows
your lead?  Warrior, Paladin, Shadowknight.  Jack-of-all-trades, master of a
dozen roles?  Necro.  Like that laid-back group experience coupled with the
'break glass in case of emergency' groove, where you can blast down a
group-killer or whisk them to safety?  Wizard or druid.  All damage, all the
time?  Mage, ranger, rogue, monk (and probably berserker after today).

Think about the role you want to fill, then try out a few classes that do
that role.  Above all, have fun!
