i'm a lvl 31 druid who's lookin for your thoughts...

re specialization
i was once told that i should simply watch as each area of magic increased
and then select the one that increased the fastest... well... they all make
out VERY quickly, maybe in 1 hour of soloing they are all maxed out again...

where would you invest your effort into ?

i have all of my practice points, haven't spent a single point. what the
heck should i do with them ? some people have told me not to and to save
them for a rainy day...right...lol...

what would you do or if you saved them, then for what ?

tanx a bundle for all your help ;-)
