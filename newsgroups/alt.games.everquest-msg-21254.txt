Look into Fish Rolls.  Ingredients are 1 fresh fish and 1 batwing in an 
oven (couldn't be much simpler).  That baking recipe trivials at 135, so 
you'll fail most of your attempts until your baking hits the 70s.

The result is a food that weighs 0.1, stacks, and is a Banquet, thus it's 
the perfect Monky food.

perpetuating upon itself--a barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits
atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred." Frank Herbert
