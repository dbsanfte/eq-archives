    Wow 15% is hy00j... how'd you get that hammer?

    And what's the combine for etheral rings of metal? :>

    I plan to get this armour for my SK pre 55 so if its heavy planar drops
its out of the question and back to acrylia for me.

    60% is an awfully good figure for armour at that end of the scale. I
think i'd be happy with 30% initially - 3 or 4 items of that stuff will get
my AC above 1k....

    One more level and I should be a hill giant farmer of extraordinary
magnitude. And then I can blow many thousands of plat on smithing.

    Well, situation seems not quite so dire on povar, I see occasional bits
and pieces for sale in the bazaar, but here's to hoping :) My main
motivation for doing it is that it's the only way my SK will be wearing
armour that good this side of christmas :) I cant actually see a strong
market for the acrylia bits - nobody seems to permanently have small medium
OR large full sets of acrylia plate in the bazaar it would be nice to
dominate all three markets by default ;)

    8 full traders satchels of armour later..... might look into the chain
market instead or as well.

    Have one of those which I'll use for the top end combines... am looking
for some more int gear for now (int buffed with C3 is only 230, have just
found a +4 item and am saving for another +6 item)

    thanks for info :)

Cheers,
James
