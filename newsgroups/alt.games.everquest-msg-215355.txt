Yep a mage in my guild summoned me a ID III bracer, turned my 360 damage
Icewind into a 430 damage nuke, other stats on bracer were 'ok' not amazing
but usable and very handy to save mana.

I wouldnt mind paying 50pp or so for this item in the bazaar for an evenings
use, you could even keep hold of it by transfering to a friend (shared bank
/ tradeskill containers dont work), and bunging on your trader for the
night, swapping again in the morning :) A pain, but possible.
