Indeed, I was annoyed at the smug shaman who looked down his nose at other
casters who used KEI. Kinda like listening to a druid or wizard diss those
who use PoK books and Nexus spires to get around.

And yes, cannidancing at 24 doesn't give you the nigh-infinite mana pool
of KEI, but it's noticeably better than plain old medding, which is all
clerics, shadowknights, etc. get for quite some time.
