Yes it does.  Them's the breaks.

It shouldn't.  The new level 48 requires only 6% more exp
to get through than the new level 47.

Or if you mean that you had done 47 before the patch, the
new level 48 requires 26% more exp to get through than the
old level 47.  That's still not going to make it "much, much slower".

The new level 48 requires only 68% as much exp to get
through as the old (hell) 45.  It should go at least 32%
*faster*, especially since at level 48 your higher level
will allow you to chew through mobs faster than you could
at 45.

No.
