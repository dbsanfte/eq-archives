Here's a post from a while back, hope this helps:

"Fredrick:
    All of your characters and equipment are stored on Verant's servers, not
your home machine.  Imagine how easy it would be to edit your character and
give him 500,000platinum coins if the info were stored locally.  All you
need to do is reinstall from your everquest CD's and your characters will be
there(on the character select screen).  The thing you did lose were your key
binding options(You'll have to redo any custom socials or hotkey settings),
but your characters will still be there."
