Starting from level 24 it will sometimes "proc" a 12 damage dd. Proc is
based on dexterity of the wielder; higher dex - bigger chance on procs.

There is also a "coldain valium" version which procs at level 1. That
version is good till about lvl 15 or so, after which you'd probably get a
better weapon  The normal version is rather crap and is roughly equal to a
normal fine steel weapon.

Good part about it is that you can hunt willowisps with them. Velium counts
as magic and fine steel does not :).
