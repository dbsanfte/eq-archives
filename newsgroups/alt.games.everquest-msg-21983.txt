Right or wrong, you've identified it exactly.  As Brad pointed out in the
<Conquest> incident, it's not "ok" to hide your casters in the corridor for an
old Antonican dragon that's been killed many times, but you'll get away with it
because there's rarely anybody watching. If you try a similar "exploit", (similar
as in VI defined it to be and "equal" sort of offense), in Sleepers, you get the
finger of God.
