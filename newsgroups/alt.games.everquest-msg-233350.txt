Peridot - a gem, used as a component by a significant number of spells
people want cast on them.

EXTended KEI - KEI is the mana users drug these days. It increases mana
regen, mana pool and stats in a way that many don't want to do without. A
high level ability allows spells to last longer than usual...

As for other acronyms there is CC which means different things on
different servers...on Antonious Bayle its always used when I see it to
mean a camp check (so asking what stuff in the zone is being actively
hutned) - though others use it to mean crowd control (the abiltiy to
control mobs moving about and causing havoc in a fight).

Mobs is a acronym (Mobile Objects I think is the long hand). It means all
the monsters basically.

SoW is Spirit of Wolf - a commonly asked for spell that speeds movement.
