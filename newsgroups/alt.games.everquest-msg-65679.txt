No, no snickering from me. Sympathy, yes, and lots of it.

I recently wrote an ADO project for a client in VB6. My boss told me
the client insisted - turns out my boss thought that since VB was a MS
product, it must be the Best Thing, and was lying to me - after the
project was completed, the client asked me "Why did you write it in
VB?"

The boss has since left the company.

And now I'm rewriting the project in Delphi, for general sale to our
other customers.

Yeah, that is annoying. Luckily you don't have to do much coding with
RAD to come up with screen shots.

Try giving them projected screen shots drawn in crayon on newsprint
sometime. They probably won't get the joke, but that's hardly your
problem.
