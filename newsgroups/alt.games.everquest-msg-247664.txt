Not once have you mentioned an instance in which they kill/stole mobs
from you. Just killing mobs in the area you've claimed as 'yours'
doesn't count.

9 times out of 10.. the people work it out. What are the odds that
some newb even needs the comp you are looking for.. rather low. IIRC
they'd have to be a lowbie untwinked rogue for it to even matter to
