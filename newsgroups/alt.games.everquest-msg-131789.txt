has anyone else died in SK at the hands of 'Pain and Suffering'?
i zoned in with my 22 erudite necro, and got the message:

pain and suffering tries to hit you but misses
pain and suffering tries to hit you but misses
pain and suffering tries to hit you but misses
you have been knocked unconcious
you died.

whats going on? this all happened in about 2 seconds then when i died my pc
crashed just to really annoy me. As if losing a level wanst bad enough (i
know losing a level is no biggie at 22 before you say anything)

Anyone got any ideas?
