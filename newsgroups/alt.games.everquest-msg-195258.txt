Man, I really wanted to find a place to snip this, but I couldn't find one
that kept the integrity of the thread intact.  Sorry.

I was there to have fun with friends, which is why it really was a non-issue
in that particular group.  However, it made me aware of the reality of the
issue in a raid setting, whereas before I just blew it off.

It's an artifact of the environment of the game as it exists with KEI in
it's current state.  Unfortunately, no matter how they nerf it, I don't see
this particular issue going away for 50+ epic/raiding groups.

And I hate it.
