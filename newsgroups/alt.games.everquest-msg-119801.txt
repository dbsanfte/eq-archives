Well, I had asked on our guild boards, and one of our shammies found it
at auction and picked me up a copy for 125 plat on Saturday. Haven't
tried it yet, but at least I have it. One use I can see for it already
is catching up with other guild groups in LGuk. My live frog faction is
fine, and this might give me a chance to go run down to an already
established Frenzy, Ass/Sup, Lord camp in progress and help out, get xp,
etc. I'm sure other uses will come to light later.
