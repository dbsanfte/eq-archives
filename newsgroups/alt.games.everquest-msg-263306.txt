Quoting from the login screen:

As of now, the NDA for the EverQuest II Beta is officially lifted. We 
encourage our beta testers to share the experiences they've had in beta with 
the rest of the EverQuest II community. Many more people who enrolled in the 
EverQuest II beta program can expect beta keys in their inboxes in the very 
near future. In addition, in the past few weeks we've let the Legends and 
Lords of EverQuest players in, and we would like to thank them for their 
support. We now have four Beta servers up and running including one French 
and one German server and we've let in over 30,000 players since July. In 
the near future that number will grow far past that. Keep an eye on your 
inbox!
