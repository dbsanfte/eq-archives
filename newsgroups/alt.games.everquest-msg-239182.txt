Crap :)

if he's not MT it'd be interesting to see
what happened when he dropped it into primary 
after the mob hit <10 percent :)

Given the way damage bonus scales with delay
his modal damage would be somewhere in the 
neighborhood of 3k - he might one shot the remaining
10 percent.

And don't think for a second that someone
wouldn't equip it - I saw plenty of warriors use
a Weighted Axe back in the day, just for the
big numbers.  In fact I put one on my never group
again list in my 40's because he insisted on 
using it - not good to be a mage getting hammered
by something and the warrior is just standing there
waiting for a 15 second delay weapon to swing again.
