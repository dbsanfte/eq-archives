Bigger mana pool does not let you do more, it just allows bigger
bursts (and longer rests).  But 115 WIS is too low for mid 30s,
there are times when you need to be able to spend a lot of mana
fast (a med break is vastly preferable to a CR).

HP and AC are worthwhile.  You will draw agro, you will get nuked,
dotted, and pounded from time to time.  If you can't take any sort
of a pounding you will take more deaths.  I've seen Clerics and
Shaman die because the mobs are hitting for max damage with nearly
every attack and there just wasn't time to save them, while my L39
Druid hasn't died except as part of a TPW in some time now, even
when jumped by giants or Ry`Gorr Elites.  Max your Druid's Defense
and be sure to get some +HP gear with AC (there's a fair amount of
stuff that raises both HP and Mana out there).  A grouping Druid
_will_ get heal agro from time to time, and you should be prepared
to grab agro and kite as emergency CC, both of these often involve
taking something of a beating.

Specific recommendations for the OP:
- do the "Fine Antique Ring" quest, soloable at L29 by a Druid.
- keep a Misty Thicket Picnic in your "next to eat" slot, force-feed
foraged food to avoid eating the Picnic while reaping it's bonuses.
- keep Qeynos Afternoon Tea in your "next to drink" slot, force-feed
foraged water to avoid drinking the good stuff.
- do the "Fine Cut, Diamond Inlaid Mask" quest, soloable at L5 by
a Druid.
- search the bazaar for items wearable by a Druid of your race, look
for good deals (compare by slot) on items with WIS/MANA/HP/AC as well
as useful Focus effects.  Keep in mind the some Focus effects are so
valuable that you don't need other stats on the item to justify them.

Focus effects easily attainable in mid-30s:
Mana Preservation 2 (Fine Antique Ring has this),
Spell Haste 2 (Fine Cut, Diamond Inlaid Mask has it),
Affliction Efficiency 2 (Chipped Bone Bracelet, very useful item)
Affliction Extension 2 (Serpentine Bracer, Kobold-hide Boots)
Extended Enhancement 2 (Drake-scale Belt)

My Druid on Stromm, totally untwinked and with little available in

Bazaar, has 630-ish AC and 930-ish HP unbuffed (and his Defense is
not yet maxed), with a 167 WIS and around +150 MANA.  This is at
L39.  You ought to be able to have 800-ish HP and 600-ish AC with
a 130+ WIS and 150+ in plus MANA on your Half Elf without too much
trouble if you take the time to do some questing and shopping.
