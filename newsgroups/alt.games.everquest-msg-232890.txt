It is a class level aa ability.  You can buy it for 6aa after training 6
points in general, 12 points in archetype, and reaching level 59.  It also
doesn't summon just your own corpse, but works like any summon corpse spell
in that you can summon the corpse of any living group member in the zone
with you.  The reuse timer on the ability is 72 minutes.
