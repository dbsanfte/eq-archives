You might want to list all your toon's equipment or post a magelo link to
give people a clearer idea of what you have and what your current int is.
The mana gained from intelligence drops off after 200 ( I don't know exactly
what the formula is) and has a hard cap of 255 (I think).  I think most
people advise getting to 200 int, then looking for plus mana items.  You
have +185 mana - is any of it also plus int?  By my calc, for a level 30
toon (under 200 int), +185 mana equals (185 / 30 = (about) 6 level multiples
of mana times 5 int for a level's worth of mana) about +30 int.  As you
progress in levels, the equivalent int provided by pure plus mana items will
decline and plus int items will be more attractive.

I don't know exactly what int items to advise you to get (since one of my
favorites, the Hoop of Magi'Kot, which is +7 int and cheap in the bazaar, is
magician only).  A Black Alloy medallion for the neck gives +5 int and mana
preservation II, which reduces the mana used on spells (up to spell level 44
I think) by 10%.  I have the medallion and really noticed a difference when
I started using post lvl 44 spells and wasn't getting that savings anymore.
There are also affliction efficiency items that may save you 20% on DoT's
but I don't know what they are.  Kobold Hide Boots might be nice.  They
don't give you more any boost to int or mana (+3 agi, +10hp), but they do
have the extended affliction II effect, which will add 10% or 20% duration
to your dots (up to spell level 44 I think).  You get more damage for the
same mana.    I'm not sure of prices on these items, but they may be in your
price range.

Never thought about that.  Maybe someone has done it and can give feedback.
