I normally give rezzes and cr ports for free if its not too much bother(as
well as being generally helpful). I also use abbreviations a lot. I guess
that means youd be "busy" or charge me a lot of money. That means you make
it to my list of people not to help for free, and I then charge you full
price, or am "busy" too. Suit yourself, if thats the way you want things.
Its your 15$ a month i guess.
