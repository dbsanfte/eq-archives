Like I said in a previous response to this thread, I think rogues are quite
well-balanced but not over-powered (I'm not addressing the legendary 'end
game).

We are, however, ABSOLUTELY group-dependant and probably THE most equipment
class and very low HP (I've got around 1200 at 44th).  Not only do we *have*
to have decent weapons, but a decent *piercer* to be competitive.  After the
SCH, prices rise exponentially.  This gets compounded by the shopping done
by others shopping for their pet twink rouges.

In exchange for the dependency on weapons and groups, we get 'sick' damage
and little other than Sneak-Hide in terms of 'useful' skills (Traps and
Locks are *rarely* useful, and then only for one click).  If the fight goes
bad, we have moderate (at best) AC, low HP, and nothing to help us escape to
safety (evade is useless against more than one mob).
That's not quite overpowered.
