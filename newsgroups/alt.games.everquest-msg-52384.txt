There are two engines in use. The game engine is an export from their
other games like Spellbinder, this is one reason there are only 4
chars per realm, which will be fixed in the medium run. The graphics
engine is licensed. it's the netimmerse engine and a new version will
be switched to in the spring expansion. Currently the game uses
version 3 the switch will be to version 4 which will improve a number
of things most  importantly lag in large battles.
