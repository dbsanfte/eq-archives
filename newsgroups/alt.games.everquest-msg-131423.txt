Perhaps because you realize that you really are sticking your head in the
sand with such an action.  Remove every Cox subscriber's freedom to post to
that group, and you won't have the warning and/or after-the-fact evidence of
someone's rant and decision to go on a killing spree, if they happen to be
on Cox.

I'm sure many people would thank you for that...  I'm pretty sure it's the
people you dislike the most.
