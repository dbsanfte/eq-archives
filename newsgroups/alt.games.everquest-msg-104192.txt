This is an Everquest Urban Legend.  I've seen this story several times
before with different main characters, I think the last time it was a Dwarf
Paladin dealing with the ebayer in question.  All the dialogue is the same
every time, almost word for word including the "Burned Woods" bit.  Don't
mean to rain on the parade, it's a great story and may actually have
happened once upon a time.  I'd be curious to hear if anyone here knows when
it first appeared or who come up with it, my first time seeing it was about
a year ago.

I even heard from a friend that a version of this story with a few
place-name changes has appeared in the Dark Age of Camelot forums now too!
