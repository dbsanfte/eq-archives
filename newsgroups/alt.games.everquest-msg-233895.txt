I have done the Shield of Bane Warding quest a few times with my old
guild and the last couple of fights are definitely not soloable. For
the fight in Katta you have 8 (I believe) skeletons to kill and then
the final fight in Grimling about 5 or 6 mobs. It's been a long while
so the numbers may be inaccurate but it is certainly a "Bring some
friends" quest at the end.

Really good fun to do though and the shield is excellent.
