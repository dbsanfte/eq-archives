I would not advise doing this quest at 18 alone. I wouldnt really advise
doing this at 25 alone.  Not that you couldn't take him down, but, taking
him down BEFORE the "red" rogue returns from his many pacings is a different
story.   The "red" rogue conned red to my Druid back when I was level 48ish
I believe it was... been awhile ago and MANY Dyllin killings ago with my
Druid I might add. <grin> He does NOT like my Druid what-so-ever.  Though,
he's not to particularly fond of my Cleric either. <shrug>  Death to all
corrupt guards. ;p
