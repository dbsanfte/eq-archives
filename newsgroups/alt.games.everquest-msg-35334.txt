Oh, yes. I really want people taking advice from somebody who's advising newbies to
go try to take down gnoll watchers at level 3.  I seem to recall that gnoll *pups*
were still occasionally handing my ass to me at level three.  And a full gnoll
would have been deep red.
  Beyond that, the quest information he provides is extremely incomplete, and
wouldn't give the player enough information to complete it any faster than they
would wandering around on their own.
