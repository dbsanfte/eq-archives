At the Bazaar screen, I find something that I want (usually cheap
compared to what other traders are asking), find my way over to the
particular trader, find the item, select it, BUT the "Buy" button is
*inactive* (greyed out). On the trader several items (not all) may be
the same way.

There was a price for the item I wanted (the item and its "price"
showed up in the bazaar screen) and I had enough plat to purchase it.
I even clicked on another item (which activated the "Buy" button
though I didn't have nearly enough to purchase) and went back to the
item I had wanted to see if it was a glitch that could be fixed. It
wasn't/didn't.

Does anyone have an explanation for this? I haven't (yet) set up a
trader in the bazaar or used the /trader screen so I don't know
off-hand if this is a glitch or deliberate (i.e. displaying an item
with a low price that the trader has no intention of selling at that
price) or a bug (known or otherwise).

Thanks.
