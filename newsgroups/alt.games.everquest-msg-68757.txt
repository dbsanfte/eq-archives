No check again.
Majority of the people who are having problems are those with within
spec or WAY THE FUCK above spec systems.  

It's not complaints like:  Oh, if I turn on all the models on my
P2-300 with 128MB of RAM, things are slow.

It's complaints like:  When I click on Play Everquest after the server
select on my 1.4Ghz Athlon, 512MB, GeForce3 system, I crash.

Or:  When I try and play, I see my system (AthlonXP 1900+, Geforce3,
1GB RAM) being slowing down within minutes eventually kicking me off
because my XP system has just allocated 2GB of swap space.

Or:  When I try and play (same system), I get anywhere between 3 to 30
second "pauses" everytime I try and spin around making it impossible
to see what's happening.

The vast majority of the people I know who are having problems have
already spent a chunk of money upgrading their system well above spec.
