Simple question.

When this is cast on any char, does it affect the swim speed?

If not, is there a spell that does?

Thinking about it, leads me to the conclusion that swim is a skill, so
therefore would not be affected by SoW.

May as well  still ask the question tho' as servers are down still, and as
its UK, I will not be playing till Thursday.

Reading this newsgroup will give me something to do at least...
