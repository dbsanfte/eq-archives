The GD key, if you found it on the ground in the middle of
the "dragon ring" portal, is what enables you to be ported back
to the GD port by a druid (and/or wizard, I presume).

Verant doesn't want people being ported deeply into Velious
without ever having gotten there the hard way (on foot), so you
first have to physically make it to a portal and pick up the key
there before you are enabled to be ported there.

The good news is that as you make it farther and farther into
Velious, each "deeper" key enables all prior portals as well,
so you can destroy your earlier portal key(s) and just keep the most
recent one -- you don't have to carry a big pile of keys around
with you.

As for a key in Iceclad, I have no idea, since the Iceclad
portal works even without any "tooth key".

And of course, there will be other keys (not found in the
dragon rings) that will do other things entirely (Tower of
Frozen Shadow floor keys, etc.) which are not related to
the portals.
