  Poem?  Um.... yes, same player (I am also the Tealeef he refers to), different
character on a different server and... Poem?   That was actually meant as prose; his
punctuation is a bit unconventional.  
  Thank you fro the link, btw, Valien.  I will post it there are well later.  And
yes, Dan I am playing my character as something of flake.  More fun that way, and
beside, I couldn't think of a plausible way to roleplay my decision as a High Elf to
take up with an Ogre.

Annie  <--- Didn't know she was married to a poet.

My main on Firiona Vie:

Teapray  -- High Elf Cleric, 15, slaughtering orcs to help Lenny's faction.

Several others played on Drinal, highest is a level 30 Ranger.
