I didn't *mind* waiting when the boat was working as intended.  It was missing
the boat in BB due to lag 3 times and -  50 minutes later (real life time) -
still being stuck on the dock in BB that I *did* mind.
Waiting on boats that never arrived (because they were *down*) I minded.  That
sort of thing.  
If they were just SLOWWWWWW I could have lived with it.....
