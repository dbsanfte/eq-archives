And they are called halflings in the game, but that doesn't mean they
have to follow Tolkeins concept completely. In fact due to licensing
issues they most likely have to be fundamentally different (hence the
magic-use, and Verants policy against using names from the books)

It is not spelled out, it is in the context of the books. Tolkeins
Hobbits were agrarian (spelling). They were a farming community that
was peacful and not known throughout the world of Middle-Earth. They
were home-bodies, and according to the text only the "deviants" like
Bilbos relative (something Tuck) ventured forth from the Shire and
mingled with the other races of middle-earth. Hobbits that left the
shire were regarded with fear and considerred to be not right in the
head. Further the magic of Middle-Earth was something that was imbued
into items, not wielded by the races themselves (with the exception of
demi-gods, which is basically what Gandalf was).

The role of the Halfling race in EQ is completely contrary to Tolkeins
definition, and the addition of RAN and PALs doens't make them any
more contrary than they already were. (which is one old-school Ranger
keeps insisting)

"The world of Norrath is built from many different fantasy story
lines."

"Drawing" the EQ halfling to look like the common image of a Hobbit
from Tolkeins work does not automatically make them Tolkein Hobbits.
It speaks more to the creativity (or lack there of depending on your
point of view) of the original artists that initially developed EQ.
