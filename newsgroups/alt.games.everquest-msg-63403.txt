In effect directly: none. It is used by people, who play classes, that
get bugged all the times. Druids hide because they're sick of transport
calls, shamen/druids hide because they're sick of 'buff me, sow me'
calls, clerics hide because they can't rez the whole zone all the time,
enchanters hide because they'r ebugged to hell for clarity and so on.
The advantage of /roleplay over /anonymous is, that your guild tag
(if you are in any) is still showing. Most guilds request that you
use /role over /anon (and none of them on raids etc).
