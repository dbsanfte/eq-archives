My friends and I in WA always called video games "pixel crack" We'd say 
"Hey whattaya going to do this afternoon?" "I dunno, probably just going 
to crack out." or "I dunno, probably go play crack." I think video games 
are much more like crack than heroin, since they can just seem like 
simple and fun and easy at first, but then slowly creep up to swallow 
all of your free time and money. They aren't necessarily overwhelming 
right off the bat, the way real heroin can be, and they are only really 
satisfying while you are doing it and the satisfaction wears off quickly 
after you stop and leaves you wanting to do it again, just like crack.
