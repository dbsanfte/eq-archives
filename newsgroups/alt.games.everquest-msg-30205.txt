There are zones in Norrath which have twin zone lines.
At the moment, Karnors and City of Mist are the ones
that occur to me.

If everyone would always turn to the right when
approaching the pairs, you'd have a relatively safe
area to zone in to and med at, going in each direction.
When I'm in DL or KC or EJ or COM, I make a point
of slapping this message on a social and mashing it
periodically as seems appropriate.  Makes an
improvement, but gosh, I still have to res people
who get trained for sitting on the wrong side or by
someone who went the wrong way.  Probably
bloody euros!
