The new spell efects are going to be running a new Graphics engine.  Sony
finaly added a line to there engine that say's if you cant see it from there
don't draw it.  as it is, the GE that they have draws every surface that can
be seen out to vision boundry, and posably farther.  This is waht kill's
everyones systems in zones with flowing trees.  THe system is drawing a tree
500 feet away even though you cant see more than 15 feet.

Hopefuly this new engine will alow me to run with my AA and AS filters on
with out making the whole world shimmer on me.

THe new graphics look great, and I cant wait to play a little on them..
guess its time to pull out my Test server Cleric and Wizard.
