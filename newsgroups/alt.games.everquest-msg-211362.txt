Incorrect.  Wolves and hawks in nature form homosexual relationships; they
are neither banished from the pack (wolves) or driven from their hunting
area (hawks).  They are in fact a normal part of their society that does not
breed.  In fact, wolves in homosexual relationships frequently bring excess
kill to nursing bitches so they don't have to leave the cubs - assisting the
pack in caring for young.
