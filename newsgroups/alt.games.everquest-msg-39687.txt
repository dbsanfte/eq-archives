I have a level 20 Iksar necromancer, who is my highest level
character, and consider myself to be an advanced newbie.   I would
appreciate fellow necro's answers to the following questions to help
me expand on my playing capabilities 
Trying out new techniques helps make the game more interesting. :)

1)  What spells do you have memorized when you solo?
2)  What spells do you have memorized when you group?
3)  What is a good use for the harmshield spell?
4)  How and when do you use the feign death spell?  I've read that if
you get the message "xxx has fallen to the ground", it has failed.  Is
this correct?  Also, is it true that if you have DoTed the mob, it
will still come after you even if you successfully cast the spell?  
5)  If you unload all your DoTs, is the sufficient for outdamaging
your pet?  If I really want the full exp, I will also lifetap like
crazy in hopes of doing the most damage.


Since level 16, I have used the darkness/pet attack/fear/unload as
many DoTs as possible in a somewhat slow fashion so mob doesn't aggro
on me/refear/(keep an eye out for pet's health and heal it or step in
to tank allowing me to increase combat skills)/wait for the DoT and
pet to finish it off

Thank you, fellow dark ones, for your opinions :)


Jennie
