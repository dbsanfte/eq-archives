Here's how much extra work this would take on the server: *zero*.  Try
this experiment.  Go to a merchant and open up the merchant inventory
window.  Then go unplug your internet connection.  In the 30 seconds
or minute or so before the client notices you've gone LD, start right
clicking items in the merchant's inventory.  You'll get the normal
item stats display for each item you click.

When you opened the merchant window, the server sent a list of all
items to display.  I don't know if it sends their stats, too, or if
those are in the game data that is on your hard disk.  Whichever the
case (and if you want to find out which case it is, you can probably
find it in the ShowEQ source, since when you open a merchant, ShowEQ
shows in the console window a list of all the items in the display, so
it should have a structure with the format of those packets in the
source somewhere), the client has all the information when you open
the merchant, and so the shading of non-appropriate items would be
doable entirely in the client.

You've confused mezzing and charming.  When something is mezzed, it
just stands around.

Did you miss the part about "to get back to their bodies"?  He's
talking about wanting to be able to help a newbie who is on a corpse
run.
