Has anyone tried a group of six Warriors?  Thinking about it...it doesn't
seem as crazy as it sounds.  Let's do some math, on six Warriors fighting
one mob.

Assume the Warriors are all taunting, so that the damage is distributed
among them.  That means each Warrior takes ~1/6 the mob's damage output.

Six Warriors kill the mob in 1/6th the time that one Warrior would, which
reduces by a factor of 6 the damage output of the mob, compared to the mob
fighting a solo Warrior.

Net result: at the end of the fight, each Warrior has taken ~1/36th the
damage he would have taken soloing the mob.

What this means is that if you had a mob that a solo Warrior would lose to,
but could get down to about 97% before dying, the group of six could take
(barely).  If you have a mob that the solo Warrior would lose to, but could
get down to, say, 85%, then the six should be able to kill it easily, with
a large margin of safety.  In fact, they should be able to do so starting at
50% health, and so they should be able to take a mob, and then bandange
themselves up.

In summary, it seems that six Warriors should be able to take reasonable XP
mobs, and do so with little downtime.

This would be fun to try.
