I have extensive exposure to those gnolls, having used them from levels 48
to 58, and having hunted in nearly every spot from pulling to the outside
(what I did at 48) to clearing the big room where the boss mob is.  Ben is
right, the warriors have about 5k hp, but I preferred them because at
least they came when you pulled them!  Damned casters stood there while
you yawned. The worst were the necros that sent me running around the
caves like a terrified chicken (one time my husband managed to root me
though before I caught a few adds...evidently feared PCs become NPCs?).  

In any case, they are not made of paper in there, but I can attest that a
well-coordinated duo of ranger and shaman found it very agreeable, and we
brought in many backpacks to fill up with vendor loot, usually getting
500pp apiece per yellow bubble.  If we were lucky, we'd get a gnollish
ring of sorcery or two (500pp in the bazaar in those days).  

And not that it matters any more with armor tinting, but the chain armor
they drop made a pretty dark blue wedding outfit. :)  Or a nice bit of
twink armor (except I never did find the pants...10 levels and no pants
dropping, sheesh).  Oh, and out of 10 levels, we did see the infamous
Mithril Knuckls drop!  Just once though...danged rare.
