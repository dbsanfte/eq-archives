}>Among participants who reported always using condoms, the summary estimate 
}>of HIV/AIDS incidence from the twelve studies was 0.9 seroconversion per 
}>100 person years. Among those who reported never using condoms, the 
}>summary estimate of HIV/AIDS incidence from the seven studies was 6.7 
}>seroconversions per 100 person years. Overall, Davis and Weller estimated 
}>that condoms provided an 85% reduction in HIV/AIDS transmission risk when 
}>infection rates were compared in always versus never users.
}>---   
}>So that would be... 15%?
}15% of what?
}It certainly doesn't mean that 15 out of every 100
}people who have sex, using a condom, with an
}infected partner, will get the disease, does it?

No, but then, neither did the 10% Sanji quoted or the value from FAIR, or 
even Rush's figure...

}>  Look, condoms just aren't perfect, and we can 
}>argue forever about what the appropriate statistic is.
}I agree. 
}What I dont agree with is Sanjians assertion that
}a person wearing a condom is ".... taking a 10%
}risk of being infected if they're sleeping with an
}infected person?"

So he left out the word 'greater'. So sue him.

}>}> When I was in high school, I was told that the condom would
}>}>protect me.
}>}Were you? I doubt it.
}>Shoot, I don't.
}I do. I cannot believe that a sex educator would
}say to his pupils "A condom provides 100%
}protection... never mind about the manufacturers
}notes, on the product, that expressly say it does
}not give 100% protection"... but thats just me.

No, I don't either.  But I can believe a sex educator would say "A condom 
will protect you against pregnancy and infectious diseases." And not 
further elaborate on that point.

}>  Sex ed has a lot of problems... It's so under seige that 
}>it's not at all suprising they can't always get the best teachers, is it?
}Did you never read the instructions on a condom?

In all probability, yes.  I doubt I'd grant them more credibility than the 
CDC, though.

}Perhaps he was told that, but I find it amazing,
}not only that he was told that, but that he
}BELIEVED it.

Well, then you really ought to be amazed at the sad state of affairs that 
is sex ed in this country.  And further amazed that we're probably doing 
better than average...

}>}> How many students know they're taking a 10% risk of being
}>}>infected if they're sleeping with an infected person?
}>}What will students do when they find out you are
}>}telling them lies?
}>}You are suggesting that one in ten of them will
}>}die, if they fuck with an infected person. 
}>}That is a lie.
}>Personally, I don't consider it a lie to tell people what you honestly 
}>believe to be true.  Even if you're wrong.  Even if it's one in seven.  Or 
}>one in thirty.
}I consider it a lie when factual error is used to promote some other 
}agenda.

I consider it a lie when deliberate factual misstatement is used to 
promote some other agenda.

}>There's also an error in assuming that the chance of contracting HIV from 
}>sleeping with an infected person without protection is 100%, when it's 
}>actually substantially lower, particularly in heterosexual or lesbian 
}>encounters.
}Which lowers your 15%, (and Sanjians 10%)
}considerably, doesnt it?

Well, the 15% doesn't change, but then, the 15% wasn't a measure of 'odds 
of contracting a disease by sleeping with an infected person while wearing 
a condom', rather it's an inverse measure of how much additional 
protection a condom gives over random chance.   I suspect I read what I 
thought Sanjian meant, rather than what he wrote.
