Well, I just have to add my 2 cents (2 CDN cents that is) to the discussion.
I feel for the original poster - almost had his same setup except a P2 400.
The rest was spot on.  Logging in and zoning were painful exercises.  The
only good part was from playing on a pvp server, I would often zone while
being chased and when I finally did make it to the other side, my attacker
would be way up ahead, over a hill, looking for me ... not realizing I was
now way behind him :=)

Not no more!  Got my new P4 1.3Ghz with 256 Megs of Ram and a 64Meg GE
Force2 video card.  Zoning is down to seconds and logging is about the same.
Its like playing in a whole new game!  Haven't been to Kunark since the
expansion was released as when I did try it with an Iksar SK, things crawled
in the field of bone and it was not the critters - it was my lousy PC!  Hope
to go there this weekend.

Total cost for the new system (w/ 19 inch Monitor, sound system and 60GB HD
among other things) - $3000 Cdn at Dell (or just under $2000 US).  Now
there's a harsh looking reality of the exchange rate.  Any one for a debate
on the shortcomings of the Liberal government's monetary policy over the
last decade and its impact on Canada's standard of living and global
competitiveness?  Hmm, wait a minute, lets save that for another newsgroup!
