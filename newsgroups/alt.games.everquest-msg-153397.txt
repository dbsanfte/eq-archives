>It would be nice if I didn't have to log out of EQ just to address

on my fire wall.<

or because your boss is coming ;)

I believe there is a program that will run EQ in a window. I have never used
it, but I have been told that you can play EQ, and check Emails or MS
Messenger etc while still in game. No doubt someone here knows the URL but I
think the programme is called EQW or EQWindowed or something along those
lines. You will prolly fond it on Google or Yahoo etc.

Good Luck.
