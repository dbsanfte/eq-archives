I did the last four yellows of 56, and essentially all of 57, 58, and 59
killing the guard sonic wolves outside Nathyn Illuminious' place in Katta,
and the two legionaires outside the door, along with one or two from inside.

The wolves and those legionaires lower Nathyn Illuminious faction, and raise
the faction almost all the other guards in Katta are on (and also raise some
Seru factions, and Coterie).  So, I am now ally with most of the guards in
Katta.

Is there anything useful to do with that faction, other than switch to
hunting those guards now until I'm back to the dubious I started at? :-)

Note that Nathyn's people don't raise any Katta factions other than guards,
so I'm still right where I started--dubious--with all the merchants and all
the quest givers that I've talked to.

BTW, Nathyn's place is a *great* way for a casual player to do the upper
50's on limited play time.  In those four levels, only twice did I find the
camp already taken, and one additional time I had to make room for a raid
that was taking Nathyn himself (I watched that one via "bind sight"...that
bastard is tough).  The wolves are blue through 59, finally going light blue
at 60 (and they seem to be the same level every time).  The guards are blue
through 58, and then occasionally are light blue at 59, and mostly light
blue at 60.  Nothing on their faction wanders, so you can med AFK safetly
(well...there is one exception...Nathyn himself came wandering by once.  I
assumed someone had pulled him when I wasn't looking and he was going home,
but I sent an Eye of Tallon in to look around after he got home...and there
were *two* Nathyns there...the wanderer and the original!  I think this must
have been a glitch).  There are merchants nearby to sell to if your faction
is good with them, and a bank nearby so you can store the loot if the
merchants won't deal with you.  Loot is at least a sword per guard, worth
about 4.2 plat, and coin up to another 4 or so.

An ambitious Druid or Wizard could probably quad, although all I did was do
the guards in threes and the wolves in pairs.  I didn't do the guards in
fours because getting the fourth took enough extra time that I wasn't sure
it was worth it.

The XP is not as good as a PoP zone, but it is good enough that in a couple
hours a night, you'll get a level every two weeks.  The big attraction is
the near complete safety, and the almost complete lack of competition.  You
can log in, get right to it, and go AFK between fights to watch TV or read
newsgroups or whatever.  It's practically no work at all...just pop back to
EQ every 10 minutes or so and kill the next repops, then back to whatever
you were doing in RL.
