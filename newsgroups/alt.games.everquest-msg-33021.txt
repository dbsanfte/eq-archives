Until recently, my level 15 ranger was wearing mainly leather with a couple
of pieces chain mail.  Since I've gotten one of my chars to master in
smithing, he wisp hunted until he had about 80pp.  Bought all of the metal
sheets and molds and brought them to my other char.  He's now wearing all
banded, except for a belt which is AC3 and has +3 STR and STA, and the
leggings which I failed to make 3 times and ran out of metal sheets. My AC
went up bunches.  I now only have, I think offhand, 13 stone or whatever, of
carrying capacity.  Banded is heavy!

My question, it doesn't seem like I'm getting hit less often or any less
hard.  Actually that wasn't a question, this is:  What is the point of high
AC?

Also, does this sound like I'm where I should be armor and weapon wise?
Armor you know, I have +2sta earrings in each ear and +2str rings in each
ring slot (or vice versa).  I carry a AC7 shield (which I will retire at
17).  I carry a frozen longsword, 7dmg and something around 30dly, no proc
but is magic.  With my feet like cat my AGI is 122. hehe

Thanks,

Lewis
