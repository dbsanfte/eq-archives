I have seen, in a number of posts, a lot of antipathy directed towards the
Dreadlands zone, and the people that inhabit it. My druid recently got to
her mid 40's and Ive been hunting her out there for a bit now. The zone
seems, if anyhting, to be underpopulated ( only 6 other people in the zone
last night ). The experience is quite qood, and the loot even better for the
level if you sell the Leggchoppers, Giant tunics, and other misc junk that
drops.

Is this different on a non-PvP server ?

Color me confused.....
