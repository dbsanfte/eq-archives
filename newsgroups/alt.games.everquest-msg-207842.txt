Hey, thats a fun idea, something that doesn't seem to be class dependant 
or level dependant; so many scavenger hunt type quests lean heavily 
towards classes with track.

Sadly I can't think of a list specifically of ground spawn stuff.

Here are a few;

Shadeweaver: bags of refuse, payala fruit
Shar Val: a couple different mosses; blue and green I think, look for 
the vah shir class quests to find them
COM: Icon of Scale  (this one is no drop though, so how's the guy going 
to prove he has it?)
GFaydark: hmm, can't remember the name, but a trade skill item thats 
green and blends in with the ground, really hard to see.  Evergreen 
twig?  Pine needle?  Something like that.
Ocean of Tears: Diamond Dust (or maybe its crushed diamond dust or 
crushed diamond?)
Lets see, there's also something that ground spawns in Skyfire for some 
quest or other, might check SF quests to see if you can find it
Eastern Wastes: Skinning Rock (again, its no drop, though)
Would you count the cards dropped by that guard Cheslin in Qeynos 
Hills?  They aren't dropped as in you kill him and loot them off his 
body, they are dropped as in you follow him around and they ground spawn 
as he passes over specific spots, if you can keep him alive that long.  
I think no drop  though.

If I think of any more, I'll add them on in another reply
