I have my new bard. I managed to buy a fine steel Ulak for a few plat
(1hs 4/23) http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=169

I guess I better get a better 1hs, a piercer and what else? I have run
a rogue, and I have max weps skill in all weps. For a Bard, keeping
max skill up in every weapon doesn't seem as important. Any
suggestions?
