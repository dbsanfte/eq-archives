Seven characters that went through the levels approriate to being in that zone,
and I never *once* thought of that.

I wonder if that would be an exploit? It actuallys sounds like a viable way for
a melee type to gain some solo xp if he couldn't get a group.  Of course,
considering the size of most of the trains I've seen in BB, for every near dead
yellow arriving at the zone, there's probably five more untouched yellows and
reds, so it's probably not that effective anyway.
  Biggest train I *ever* saw there was one we caused. We were doing a brief
"Revenge on the Gnolls" event some time back where we went in and sent some of
our highest level folks, sow'd, all the way to the bottom of the dungeon,
bashing or popping arrows into every single gnoll they could find, dragging them
all to the top, and nuking/melee them all to death.  Then we left all the bodies
there for the newbies to loot for free and took off.
  I honestly think we had better than 75% of the entire zone population of
gnolls up there.  Easily fifty gnolls. Possibly a lot more. Hard to estimate.
Even with all spell effects, etc. off, I'm shocked the zone didn't crash on me.
The lag was staggering.
