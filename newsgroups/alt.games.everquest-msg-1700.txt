Wizards can be very useful at pulling when you are pulling greens to
clear an area.  A friend of mine (55 Cleric) wants an item of Grachnist
the Destroyer that has a right-click effect of, I think, Grim Aura (some
low level necro buff, anyway).  He wants this because he duels a lot.
Right-click instant casting buffs are useful in duels because you can
arrange for them to be the first things on your buff list, and so when
someone dispells you, you just click and put them back.  You can put
them back faster than they can dispell, so as long as you have as many
up as their best dispell can remove at once, they can never get to your
other buffs.

Anyway, I've occasionally helped him camp Grachnist.  Grachnist can
randomly spawn for any of the goblins at the fort in WW, or for the two
near FoB.  (I don't know if he can spawn anywhere else).  So, you
basically go to the fort and just start wiping out the goblins, and
you'll get Grachnist now and then (you can get more than one, by the
way...I've seen up to three Grachnist's at once).

I can pull quite effectively for my friend, by just running a circuit of
the fort, hitting F8 to target whatever Goblin I'm passing, and hitting
the hotkey for my Staff of Temperate Flux to make the goblin follow me.
Most of the goblins are teens or low 20's, so even if a couple manage to
hit me if I make a wrong turn, I'm not in any real trouble...worst that
happens is an occasional stun and maybe half a bubble of damage waiting
to become unstunned, then my jboots get me to safetly.  When I've got
enough goblins, I run back to my friend and stop, and he unleashes
"Upheaval", which is a PB AOE that does something like 680 damage to
them all for 625 mana, and the goblins fall over dead.

It seems to me that the requirements to pull are:

1. You can get to the mobs you want to pull, or at least get close
enough to do something to get them aggroed on you.

2. You can survive the run back to where your party is.

3. When you get there, if you are not the main tank, the mobs will not
be so aggroed on you that it is hard to get them to switch to the main
tank.

4. You can get the number of mobs you want.  E.g., if the mobs are in a
camp, you have some way to just get the ones you want.

5. You can avoid aggroing unwanted mobs on the way to and from the
desired mobs, or you have a way to get rid of the extras.

In appropriate circumstances, anyone might be able to meet these
requirements.  The traditional pullers, like monks, can meet them pretty
much everywhere, and so are the natural choices for pulling, even when
others could do it, because they will be more experienced in general at
pulling.  Still, if in a particular place, someone else can also pull,
they might be appropriate even if not a normal puller, such as when
Carlo pulled Unrest because he knew the zone.
