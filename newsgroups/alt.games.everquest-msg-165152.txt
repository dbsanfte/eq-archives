You do know that the jboots used to drop off a mob in Najena, right?

You know why they don't anymore?  The same reason they changed the cleric
epic.  

Because it became a CS nightmare.  Killstealing, ninjalooting, training,
etc, etc, everything we've come to love about camping rare spawns in the
game.

And if the reward is so little, why are you doing it?
