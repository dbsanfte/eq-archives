I would hazard to guess it would be going to the expect bandwidth usage as
stuff from Legends filters down to our live servers.  For instance, people
have been griping about not getting the neat stuff legends is getting at
$40, like the mapping stuff to get an idea where guild people might be...
Or perhaps GUI interface enhancements people are constantly demanding,
which, btw, could require more data to be pushed down the pipe.

As for adding more CSRs...  Yeah, it would be nice to have more GMs, like 2
or 3 GMs on a server instead of one, but then...  If you want to start
adding up the cost to make such an annoucement with the fact there is a
$40/month server with GM staff, no Guides...  I think that would be
stretching the lie.
