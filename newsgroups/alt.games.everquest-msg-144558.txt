I don't think that's the case.  Certainly, the rich get richer.  That's
their goal, and they have the resources by which to do that.  However, I
don't believe that the poor get poorer.  The poor, if they so desire, move
up into the middle class, even in pure capitalist societies.  Granted, their
wealth may not grow at the rate that the rich does, but their purchasing
power definately increases.  I think the adage that "a rising tide raises
all boats" is more accuate.

Understand, though, that we are only getting one side of that.  The
anti-success have done their level best to paint that era in an unfavorable
light.

I tend to think it's a more common occurrence than we think.  Any reason you
think otherwise?

Unions, as they started, were a natural thing.  There's nothing wrong with
collective negotiations.  However, when unions achieve a quasi-legal status,
and take actions that are not in keeping with the wishes of their
rank-and-file members, then they're out of hand.  When they pretty much
replace the management of a company, then they've gone way to far.

It also hurts the company.  It's because of unions that Northrop Grumman -
Newport News (the new name of Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Co.) is
behind schedule.  Of course, I'm slightly bitter about this, since it's the
sailors who will have to work through Christmas to get caught back up again.
So, FU, Steel Workers Local 8888.

Sorry for the vent.

Heh, if you're suggesting we reign in trial lawyers, just hand me the
petition.  What gets me, is that a trial is no longer a matter of whether
you're guilty or innocent, but who can make a better case, and can distort
the facts to their advantage.  I mean, you've got lawyers out there
defending people they _know_ are guilty.  Not just trying to mitigate the
sentence, but trying to get them off.  What the hell type of system is this?
And we won't even go into the tobacco lawyers...

The point is, even then, class barriers were not uncrossable.  Many times,
there was no need to do so, since much of the stuff that was needed could be
grown or made at home, so the "poor" were able to maintain an acceptable
standard of life, even with little income.  Of course, that didn't hold for
the city-dwellers.

The only difference is I'm not 13.  Instead of 12 hour days, we've got port
and starboard rotation (six on watch, six off... do maintainence during your
off time.  Sleep when you get the chance).

Different thing.  Poison isn't a biased word, it describes what I see happen
to capitalism when socialist points are introduced.  Specifically, it's a
choking agent.  Conversely, capitalism seems to be a blood agent when
introduced to a socialist society.  I only mentioned one side here, but I've
mentioned the flip side elsewhere.

Again, I don't see it as a hybrid.  There was a market for that type of
compensation package, as demanded by the more valuable workers.  Those who
met the market were rewarded, those who didn't, were stuck with the leftover
employees.

Of course not.  Which made the anit-trust sutis a joke.  Out of all
Microsoft has done, they pick on the _bundling_?????  WTF?  How about
collusion?  How about vindictive market practices to ensure enforced
excusivity?  It's like investigating Clinton, and only delving into the
Monica scandals, but leaving the sale of arms for campaign contributions
alone.  Anyways, I digress again.

Much of it has to do with human nature.  I don't know what any government
can do to prevent it.

Public safety.  You'll notice, however, that traffic courts are civil,
rather than criminal.  Kind of an interesting situation.  A civil offense
that could carry criminal sentences.  And of course, not having to worry
about the rules of evidence that come with criminal courts and trial by
jury.

That's a bit of a red-herring.  Giving money is alot different than giving
blood in many people's minds.  You don't get stuck with a needle the size of
a turkey-baster to give money.

I really didn't want to hear that, since I'm planning on moving back to the
Valley when I get out.

Here's the question.  Did he really have to get unemployment, then?  Maybe
it should be redesigned to be quicker to access if needed, and it would be
expected that it's only used when personal funds are depleted.

That tend to be the norm, as I've seen.  You take a "vacation" when you get
laid off.  After a few weeks, then you start looking for a job again.

Get Ogre warriors as "enforcers."  See Og for an appeal.

Who's taxes did he want to raise?  As long as it hurt the rich more than it
hurt the middle class, people will vote for it.
