A matter of perspective, no doubt. The ritual was a renaming ceremony
coupled with the equinox celebration. As it was the store being
renamed, the ceremony was held at the store, in the only place
available - the parking lot. The advertising was done through
low-visibility channels, specifically word-of-mouth and in-store
fliers.

Agreed. A lot of people have jumped on the pagan bandwagon in the past
few years because it seemed like the cool thing to do. But relatively
few of the "because it's cool" crowd hold the position of High
Priestess and own pagan stores.

No matter what names you may want to call the participants (such as
morons and idiots), the simple fact remains that one group of people
got together for a happy peaceful gathering, and another showed up for
no other reason than to disrupt it.
