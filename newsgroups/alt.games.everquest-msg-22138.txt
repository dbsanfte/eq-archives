I fully agree with you, my main plays on luclin and is a dark elf
necro, nektulos forest is crawling with twinks still asking for
more stuff, had him (lvl 16) + my de enchanter (lvl 4) up to
Thurgadin and that was nice, no begging for spare arms or coins
no constant beggings for buffs,sows and such, to bad i can't hunt
there, would have been great.

All this begging is seriously worsening the game experience, getting
really sick of it, people seems to think that you can't play without
sow, hey i managed to run from neriak to N ro, taking the raft and
then taking the icebraker to iceclad ocean and then only by using my
lvl 4 enchanter spells go trough io, ew, gd into Thurgadin.
