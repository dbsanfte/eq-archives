I too have gone for XBox.. I also agree with you on nealry all your points.

GTA is better on the PC (its already been mentioned) one plus point that
wasnt raised was the fact you can select mp3s as a radio station, just
drag and drop shortcuts into the directory.

Another point.  you said "The XBox is simply better hardware." It isn't
better hardware at all, its just the graphics are better and probrably
will remain so until the next generation of consoles is out.

Check this link out http://www.cybercrash.be/xboxvsps2h.html

This guy is obviously on the side of PS2. What he fails to emphasize enough
is the fact that its taken PS2 developers 3 years to utilise 50% of the
complex hardware. The next generation are looming on the horizon and its
my guess that the graphics on PS2 won't catch up to XBox even though it is
technically superior.
Another stab in the dark here.  I think i'm right in understanding that PS3
is going to be equally complex to code for.  No one yet has managed to
write an effective compiler for PS2, most code is written to machine code.
Now if XBox2 is another PC in a box and is sufficently powerful, the
graphics will yet again be better than the PS3s simply because 70-100% of
XBox2 will be better than 25-50% of PS3.

Does anyone know if PS3 will include a hard disk? Its one of the best
features of XBox in my opinion.

Just my thoughts after reading that article.
