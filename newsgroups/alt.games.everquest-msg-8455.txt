First off, that's an odd class to have pulling. Granted, a good player can
pull successfully with any class in the game, but paladins don't really seem
tailored to pulling as much as other classes with crowd control abilities,
tracking, snare-like effects, speed enhancements, etc. Anyway ...

It depends on your pulling technique. By and large, if you're just plunking
an arrow into him, turning and running, a bow with decent range is all you
really need. You don't want to get too close, after all. On slower mobs, or
if you have a "slowing" debuff (haven't played a paladin, so I'm not 100
percent sure on that), a bow and arrow upgrade can help a lot. As a ranger,
I can tell you that a quick arrow/snare combo, following by a continuing
stream of arrows as I run backwards to my group can really soften the mobs
up. Plus, with the better bows and arrows comes better damage.

But again, if you're really just shooting and running, there's little need
to get anything that will cost you a sizable amount. Find a fletching and
get yourself an Elm Recurve or something, Cheap and effective.

Yup, even if you miss. It works just like a melee hit, though - and this
could be my imagination - the agro range seems a bit lower with a bow hit
when compared to a melee hit. That could be me, though.

No. Some means of getting the mob's attention will attract more buddies than
others, in my experience. Spells seem to stir up the most for me. I used to
pull with flame lick, just to give them a little AC debuff for the pull.
When pulling groups, however, that is a surefire way to get them all stirred
up. Even taking bandit camps in the Karanas, now green to me, I've found
that a flame lick to one will agro several of those green SOBs, while I can
pull them out of the camp one at a time with the bow.
