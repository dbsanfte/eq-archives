Hehe, almost jaZZ. Died once at Naggy (ofcourse), and I died once because we
were trying to rescue a little 60 druid who tried to take out King Tranix
after the raid. Most of the raid force was already gone and we had 2 groups
still in Sol B. So what the heck lets go and do a CR for him.. he really
help us with buffing and stuff.

Ok bad thing...very bad thing...it was totally disorginised(sp?). And at the
end we had 3 FG's a handfull orso LDC's and adding a few stone spiders and a
loney bat chasing us out of Sol B. Corpses were all over the place. I think
5 made it because they could camp out before taking aggro. So after I popped
back at the UP zoneline (yikes!), and tried to see how far my corpse went. I
knew I passed the sonic bats somewhere so I started to look around there.
Hehe then I a Nox spider found me and pop back at UP zoneline.

Later we got a couple of friends together to get all the corpses. First time
I teamed up with a 60 cleric, 61 warrior, 65 Sk, and prolly a 65 rogue from
Silent Redemption(out Ubah guild on Brell). Was awesome to see it at
work..OMG what a battle spam. Anyway everything worked out well and we even
killed Tranix and the Magus guy.

I had so much fun, haha.
