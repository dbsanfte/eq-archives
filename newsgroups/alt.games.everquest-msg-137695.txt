Didn't they implement NPCs that would port you? or was that a rumor that got
ugly?

Dreadlands is a 'relatively' safe way IMO... all you have to do is make sure
you don't run into anything... Sure they are all deep red but with SoW and a
good eye (only problem I could see is if you had clip plane at 0...) should
have no problem getting to RM/FV and then to LoIO... as a Very Frail
enchanter growing up I used to run thru this zone on a regular basis. don't
think i've ever done the OT trip... might have done the FV trip once...
