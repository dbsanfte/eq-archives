Twinking, and then playing the game "as intended" just with more power. 
Believe me, fungi tunic doesn't even come close to a dedicated PL, not even
close.  And I have to say, it's the first time I've ever seen twinking
called PLing.  Do you call a druid healing/thorning/snaring/rooting for a
level 5 "twinking"?

Fungi tunic results in level 50s with 10 days /played.  Dedicated PL results
in level 50s with 40 *hours* /played (of which I've seen a few already, /who
all vah 50 60).
