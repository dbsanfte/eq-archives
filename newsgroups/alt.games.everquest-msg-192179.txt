Yep - noticed the same crap^H^H^H^H attitudes recently. 

Don't know if it is new or not - I'm not known for doing pickup groups
with my cleric, but I had some time to kill and wanted some
experience.  Got a group, 59 paladin as MT, and he asks for a dot.  I
say, "Gee, I'd love to, but I only have a few left and I'm flat broke"
(true).  He shrugs and says he doesn't have a dot on him.  I let hit
drop.  After about 10 minutes, I cast the damn thing - his dropping
health on adds made me too nervous.  So, I ate that one.

But not again.
