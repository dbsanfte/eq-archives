You lost me. Why would the equilibrium of some species force others to
evolve in rapid bursts? Evolution isn't a planned thing; either a
mutation happens, or it doesn't, and it either survives or it doesn't.
It can be a useless bit of fluff or a genuine survival perk, and the
best survival mutation ever could easily have died in a freak accident
without ever passing on its genes.
Anyway, I'm rambling. Answer my question, please.
