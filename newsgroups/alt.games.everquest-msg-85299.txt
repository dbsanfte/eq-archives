Is the Bazaar zone a flop on everyone else's server as well?  On my server
EC is still the only place to buy and sell - there are never more than 10
people in the Bazaar.  It seems to me the main problem is lack of easy
access to the zone.  You can't just port nearby (like WC).  You have to make
your way to a Nexus and then wait for 15 minutes.   I think if they had put
a nexus portal in WC instead of BFE-North Karana, that might help things a
bit.   This is my reason for not going to the Bazaar.  My usual hangout (as
a human) is the Freeport area, and getting to a Nexus portal is a pain from
there.
