The UK and the US also have sizable Muslim minorities, and France has a 
much more thorough program of cultural integration than most others. In 
addition to that, Algerians are mostly Sunni, while a majority of Iraqis 
are Shi'ite. What makes you think that French Muslims would react with 
more violence than, say, UK Muslims?

Pending armageddon? From Saddam Hussein? Sorry, but you'll have to be a 
little more detailed than that, because I don't see how "armageddon" 
follows any possible course of action or inaction in Iraq (with the 
possible exception of the US trying to nuke Bagdad and the missile going 
astray and hitting Moscow instead).

Then I'm afraid you are being insufficiently cynical. Me, I've found 
that no matter how cynical I try to be, the truth always turns out to be 
a whole lot uglier.

If the US had solid intelligence about Saddam's WoMDs, what stopped them 
presenting that evidence to the Security Council? I'm afraid that "take 
our word for it" and hastily forged documents aren't sufficient reason 
for invading a country. You say "safely reveal", but for goodness' sake, 
safety from whom? the US is *already* the 800lb gorilla. The only 
possible reason for not releasing information on Iraq's WoMDs is if that 
information was unacceptably embarrassing.

Those are all true, and I would add that another important reason would 
be to weaken Russia's influence in the region. But having said that, I 
still think that all those goals are secondary to securing sweet deals 
with American and British oil companies... And yet even *that* isn't the 
main reason. See a few paragraphs below...

Having said that, this is not something that will remain in the realm of 
the hypothetical for long. If the new Iraqi post-war administration 
honors the existing deals with Russian oil companies, rather than 
calling them off, I will happily admit I was wrong.

Hell, I'd place them in the Axis of Evil ahead of Iran, myself.

I don't disagree with that analysis, but honestly, I think that kicking 
the ass of a Islamic nation is not going to make life any easier for the 
more western-friendly reformists in Iran. Rather the opposite, in fact... 
the Great Satan strikes again.

A-ha! That's been my point all along. I think this war is mainly about 
giving the US a seat at OPEC by proxy.

The same argument put in a different way: the War on Terror serves as 
the perfect excuse for a spree of oil-thirsty adventurism. Why is Saddam 
any more dangerous now than he was before 9/11? No connections have been 
established between him and Al-Qaeda, and in fact he's remarkably 
westernized, and has no truck with Islamic fundamentalism. Hell, he 
tried to play that card during the first Gulf War, and was pretty much 
laughed at. He's not even trying that this time around.

The question is not whether *I* think it would be okey. The question is 
that the US does not care whether the UN approves of any given military 
action, so you can't argue that they don't attack North Korea because 
the UN hasn't drafted a resolution yet.

Oh, please. According to the CIA, North Korea probably has at least a 
couple of nuclear weapons, and it has the capacity to deliver them to 
some US territories perhaps right now, and to the US mainland in a few 
years. Of Saddam's fabled weapons of mass destruction, nothing has been 
found, and nothing has been used, even in his hour of greatest need.

North Korea hasn't invaded South Korea yet mostly because of the 
billions of dollars the Pentagon has spent on dissuading them, although 
they keep playing silly buggers around the DMZ and the South Korean 
coast. As far as genocide goes, well, Kim Jong Il isn't actively 
massacring his own people, admittedly, just allowing them to starve by 
the millions.

Well, the US has conspicuously failed to convince most of the world that 
military action on Iraq *is* necessary... I don't recall these enormous 
demonstrations or this level of acrimony during the Afghan war, or 
during the Bosnian campaign. 

Saddam Hussein is undoubtedly a callous, homicidal tyrant, but he's not 
crazy, and he wasn't an immediate threat to anyone. Kim Jong Il is 
completely psychotic and armed with nuclear weapons, and he appears to 
be in a desperately (perhaps terminally) attention-seeking mood. Now, 
you could argue that Iraq is a much softer target than North Korea, and 
I would agree with that, but it would be a bit ironic to resort to that 
argument in the same thread in which you accuse the French of cowardice.

I agree that the situations of Iraq and North Korea aren't comparable, 
but unfortunately the reason is geology, not politics.
