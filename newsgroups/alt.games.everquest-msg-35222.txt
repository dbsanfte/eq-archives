First, you don't need a 51 rogue to pick those locks.  Anyone 40+ will be
able to do it, I think the absolute cut off is somewhere down around 35 or
so.  Make sure they've maxed their lockpick skill though, lots of folks
ignore it.

There are 6 reaver spawns, but you generally want to ignore one or two of
them unless you need them for the shaman or mage epics.  One spawns Lord
Rak'ashiir who can seriously mess you up if you aggro him unprepared, and
the other spawns Neh'ashiir who is just a real pain to get to.  When you
kill a reaver, either another reaver will immediately spawn on top of you,
or you'll get a phantom or one of the names.

Aside from that, it really depends on the levels you have available to
you.  We generally do it with about 3 groups in the high 40s/low 50s,
overkill for the most part, but sometimes you get five reavers in a row and
will really appreciate the extra manpower.  You will need to be tank heavy,
the nukers can basically sit and watch while fighting the reavers
themselves.  I'd really recommend a feign puller, there's a 3 reaver spawn
that can be really tough to split for anyone else.

The reavers have a 2 hour respawn time, we usually get one jade reaver per
clearing.
