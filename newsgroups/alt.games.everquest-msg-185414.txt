Yep.  They're fun together.  The ranger is a great tracker and he's a
pretty decent melee boy.  The mage has kick ass pets and nukes like
nobody's bidness.

Ranger uses his heal spell the most, along with the usual snare, and
fear.  They're a fun little group.  The dynamics will change soon,
though.  I want to level my long abandoned wizard up from 25 to 30, so
I'll have to pair him with either the ranger or the druid to level him
up.  

In either case, I predict a long long time in SKaranas killing birds
and horsiemen.
