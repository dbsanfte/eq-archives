Also if you use a pooka the mr is low enough that it will not break charm
early. Dogs would just be an awfull pet choice since they are high mr.

Since invisibility breaks charm and charm has an 8 minute duration just
break it when you are ready not when it just happens to break. Rangers
really shine here since they can snare the pet, bow dammage does not draw
aggro off a pet, they can weaponshield to tank for as long as a named takes
to kill, and they can single pull with harmony.

Is the group we used to farm jirrahl. Was very worthwhile till all the
chanters got bored :) It is now hard as hell to find 2 blue pookas but shrug
is still doable. I actually have to work in kt but all my twinks full up on
tipt/vxed stuff 8/

If you dont have a cleric and a rogue to camp this would probably be much
harder. The run to tipt could get old fast.
