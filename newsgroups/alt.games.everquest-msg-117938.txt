Looks like there could be a full set of Shissar weapons with +5 stats.
For example :

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=11394
7/22 1hb +5 Wis

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10198
7/20 HtH +5 Dex

They seem to drop in Ssraeshza Temple (and maybe the Grey)

Value about ??? The Hammer is listed at ~150 the HtH at up to 300

Take your pick

Jim
