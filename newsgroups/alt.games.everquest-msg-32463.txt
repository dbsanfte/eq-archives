 Let me explain it slowly... You want to keep jboots up in your top slot
because certain mobs will do AoE dispells. Many times.  So, here's what
you do: make jboots your first buff. get all your other buffs. Engage
mob. Mob dispells. Player reactivated jboots. Bing, top buff spot is now
filled. Mob dispells jboots. Repeat until the mob is dead or you are.
This is the value of insta-cast items. It just so happens jboots is one
of the most common. For everyday running around I'll agree that tboots
are more than adequate.
