C3=KEI

SoW is so easy to get I wouldn't pay more than 20pp or so for it (come to
think of it I wouldn't pay anything because I can cast it anyway :) )

KEI goes for anywhere from 50 to 150 pp on my server, 100pp being the usual
price.

My God would you benefit.  SoW is not nearly as awesome, if you're a bard
it's worthless to you and otherwise it's mostly useful in outrunning mobs.
But KEI -- KEI will give your INT and WIS a huge boost and you'll regen mana
so fast that you can cast your most expensive spell over and over and over
and at lvl 12 you'll still be at 100% mana after casting it 100 times
nonstop.  But at lvl 12 you probably can't afford it.  Remember, though, KEI
won't protect you from highlvl mobs.  A friend of mine once cast KEI on my
wiz when he was level 6, and, newbie that I was, I went and tried to kill
Fungal Fiends in Paludal... LOL... while I had easily enough mana to kill
them, that didn't stop them from bashing me into the ground before I got off
anywhere close to enough nukes to hurt even one of them.
