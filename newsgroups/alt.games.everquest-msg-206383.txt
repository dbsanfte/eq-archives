Actually, the RNG is fine.  It's the way they use it that is streaky, and it
is almost certainly no accident.  A statistician who plays EQ investigated
this.  He generated a bunch of random numbers with the /rand (or is it
/roll?  I never can remember which) and analyzed them, and they were
fine--good distribution, no streaks.

He also cast a spell 25000(!) times and analyzed the fizzles, and this is
what he found:

    Overall chance of fizzle: 6%
    Chance of 2nd fizzle given 1 fizzle: 20%
    Chance of 3rd fizzle given 2nd fizzle: 41%
    Chance of 4th fizzle given 3rd fizzle: 53%
    Chance of 5th fizzle given 4th fizzle: 61%

Since the RNG is good, this almost certainly means the game specifically
raises the fizzle chance after a fizzle.

An interesting experiment would be for someone to see if this is overall, or
per spell.  For example, cast spell X, and whenever that fizzles, cast spell
Y, which is a first level spell using a skill you've got maxed.  Then cast X
again.  It would be interesting to see if X has a 6% or a 20% chance of
fizzling.  If it is 20%, it would be interesting to do this again, except
for Y do a low level spell using the *same* casting skill as X (e.g., maybe
they keep seperate fizzle chances for evocation, abjuration, etc).

I think next time I have to summon my familiar, which is usually a "fizzle
away two bars of mana" kind of thing, I'll try casting "Halo of Light" after
each failure to summon the familiar.
