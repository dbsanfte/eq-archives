Hey, coincidentally I just stumbled onto that exact same tip last night on
the Everquest page. I haven't got to try it yet but I'm glad to hear it

That file determines the size of the packets we're sent so if we have a
faster connection then receiving more info helps make it run a lot better.
Well I'm off to try it out. Later.
