I admit I haven't done a rigorous check, nor appproached LDoN in any 
sort of a disciplined way; I've done whatever dungeon people wanted, 
with whatever groups came to hand.

This means I have three fails (two with partial success) and have only a 
few points in Miragul, none at all in Deepest Guk.  The majority of my 
points are spread evenly between Mistmore and Rujarkin, with about half 
that amount in Takish... although due to the prevalence of summoned mobs 
in Takish, I'd presumably be more use there.

Here's the thing, at nearly 400 points total, there's still nothing I've 
seen that I'd buy; this includes stuff running as much as 220 points 
when I have no more than 160 points in any one mission type.

I am untwinked in the classic sense, I have nothing on me that I didn't 
personally earn the money for, and not by quasi-twinkish means of 
selling spider silks or spiderling silks or leather padding or any of 
the other ways in which a low level character takes advantage of the 
relative weath of high level characters by doing their tedious work in 
exchange for outrageously high recompense.  No, I've earned money 
largely by killing mobs that were at least cyan to me (occaisional bouts 
of killing green mobs with a partner who was getting exp aside,) and 
dumping almost everything to vendors, not because I object to the 
bazaar, but because I find it tedious.

Still, I have sold items in the bazaar to people who have money earned 
by "other means", I'm probably still tainted (if you want to call it 
that) by the general inflation.

Worse, I've purchased items in the bazaar, and there taken advantage of 
the substantial Deflation; items which were once valued by players at 10 
times what they are now drape my body in many locations.

I look at a 220 point item, and realize I could buy better for 220pp... 
but I earn ten times as much PP in an LDoN run than LDoN points, and I 
can make much better money than that in many camps out in the 
non-instanced world.

But its worse than that.  At my level (52) I make an average of 15 
points per mission.  I've been 52 for quite a while now, deliberately 
staying here to let a friend catch up with me, so I've made quite a few 
15 point runs.  At 15 points each, my 400 point total would represent 27 
missions run, or between 27 and 40 hours in mission time plus another 27 
hours or so of pre mission and post mission time.

But I wasn't 52 the whole time, I started much lower, in my 30s.  When I 
was seeing 3 points, 4 points, 5 points a mission.  The gear I'm seeing 
available at 220 points would also have been something I'd turn my nose 
up at level 34, a time when I was still wearing mostly newbie quest 
gear!  Yet it would have taken 100 LDoN missions to get to my current 
total, and since LDoN got me between 1 and 2 yellow per mission, I'd 
have long since been significantly higher level.

What would interest me?  Simple; augments for focus effects, augments 
with clicky powers, augments with stat boosts, level appropriate spells 
that are priced at reasonable points for that level... actual items are 
very unlikely to be interesting, except that if there were reasonable 
point costs ones with more augment slots than "real world" items, and 
reasonable stats compared to what can be purchased with the sort of cash 
that is dropped in LDoN, these might be worth buying since you can 
rapidly run out of places to put augments.

At something like 160 points, there's an augment to add 2 AC.  Two.  I 
can't think of a class that would profit by putting an extra what, 30 
points (are there 15 locations on a body?) of AC on at any level, in 
exchange for 2400 LDoN points, there -has- to be a better use of your 
time than that.

What would the point values have to be then?  Well, lets say you can do 
   a mission for 3 points at level 30 (which is more or less the case). 
  In 3 missions you'll be level 31... so really there ought to be 
worthwhile things you can buy for no more than 9 points.  Things which 
will be disposable, like focus II effect or something, focus is ideal 
because there are other cheap routes to it and because the max level of 
spell it effects means that you'll be discarding it in a few levels 
anyway, when you'll be level 50, earning 15 points per mission, and 
should be finding similar items for your new level at around 45 points each.

What do you think, am I missing something, or is the ... I won't say 
risk, but toil versus reward totally out of whack for the lower levels 
of LDoN play?

ps Not that I don't enjoy LDoN, nor do I find it poor reward overall; 
with an average of 2 augments per mission I end up with 1 every 3 or so, 
plus the exp is just fine and I like how easy it is to find groups and 
go do something with no hassles about it already being camped; I 
especially love the way it forces you to move around instead of taking a 
static camp... this is the original Vision of the game that was so 
astonishingly botched by the spawn mechanic.  Its just the adventure 
points part that seems, well, pointless.
