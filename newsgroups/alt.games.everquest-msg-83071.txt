I think you hit the nail square on the head with that comment CF. Haven't
you notice that it is now also considered majorly cool to be an obnoxious
pratt as well? I don't particularily like it myself, but I am not going to
let it bother me in the slightest either.

It is just a fad that if ignored will die soon (Hopefully!). Of course the
more attention, negative or positive they get then the longer it will take
for it to pass : (
