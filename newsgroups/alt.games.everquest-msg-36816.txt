Greetings all!
    Question:  Am I exploiting the gnolls of South Karana?

    Background:  It's amazing just how badly some skills can slip when you
don't don't use them for 20+ levels.  My 30th level was embarassed to cast
Invisibility to Undead in Unrest, because I hadn't practiced enough
divination prior to that.  Same thing with my main:  as a 35th level
warrior, I spent so much time with 1HS and 2HS that most all other weapons
were useless in my hands.  I had recently mastered 2HB because I bartered
for a nice 2HB from Velious, so I figured it was time to work 1HB and pierce
(maybe H-2-H...still undecided on how cool it would be to master that ;-) ).

    Situation:  I go to the Hill in SK.  Bow-pull a blue gnoll from the hill
and move back so he's away from the hill.  Melee him with 1HS or 2HS until
he runs, then switch to 1HB and peirce to finish him.  He goes back towards
the hill, and there are other gnolls there and I'm sure I can't take the
adds, so I stop attacking, move back some distance and sit.  Done this
before in Crushbone, and the orcs would come right  back and engage.  Well
this gnoll is undecided;  he comes closer, then turns away, then comes
closer, then turns away...rinse...repeat.  I figure his health is returning,
so he's getting braver, and remembering why he's mad with me in the first
place.  When I stand and engage him he still turns to the hill, and I still
suck at 1HB and peirce, so I break off again before he gets into aggro range
of the other gnolls.  This whole process repeats itself until I grow weary
of it and finish him off with 2 swords.

So what I had last night was a blue mob I could use to raise skills, who
would never attack me, and as long as I kept him from others he was mine to
play with for as long as I wanted.  Kinda cheap, I think.  Not sure if I'll
do it again, beacause I felt dirty for doing it.  I may do it once more to
see if the situation repeats itself.
