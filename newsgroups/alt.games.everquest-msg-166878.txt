Correct. It was a lot harder to see the effect of supply and demand.
The "Time Constant" of an offer was only as long as someone stayed in
EC or how long it took to scroll by. In effect the bazaar search
feature made it a lot easier to compare prices and promoted
competition, which is essential to free enterprise.

Not a theory, it is a fact of life. Don't know where you live, but in
most areas we have a Flea Market. There are few conrols. Taxes are a
cost of doing business. When you look overseas, the regulations they
have in some places make the cost of doing business higher, so a true
capitalist system is harder to see.

Perhaps you should look harder around you. Even in communist China
capitalism lives.

Actually taxes are not anything more but the cost of doing business.
Rarely does the government provide a venue. In EQ we made our own
venue before the bazaar. My money in my bank is not taken from me.
Inflation is present, but I remarked before so is something else we
don't often see in a mixed economy (mixed means capitalism spoiled by
socialism) which is delfation. Prices fall frequently when supply is
increased.
