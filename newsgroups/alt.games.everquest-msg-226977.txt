It's a bidding system.  The first guy to get something generally pays the
most, as he outbids everybody else interested in the item.  On down the line
as we hit that mob over time until somebody is getting it for the base value
with no competition.

Once a mob gets to the point where we can predict that most of the stuff
possible to get will rot, we have to have a pretty good reason to actually
go back and hit it.  Have done THO, for example, once in the past year and a
half, while we still go and hit burrower pretty regularly.
