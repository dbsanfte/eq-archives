I wasn't quite sure what I was doing when I started this "project" After all
it's not something I've ever done before, but I like to learn by doing. I
was trying to do things the world's way, but I realize that I'm hopelessly
overpowered and outnumbered and this is really a battle between God and
Satan not between me against the world, as that is a battle that cannot be
won.

So then, if you commit any act of mayhem or violence against otherwise
peaceful and law abiding citizens and authority figures in the name of
Christianity then you are not a Christian, that is not how God works.

This is all about faith and prayer and waiting and trying to be decent to
others, that is really all you can do if you really believe in God.

So then again I repeat, I DO NOT CONDONE VIOLENCE IN ANY FORM, if some one
beats you up, don't fight back, yet don't break in your committment to God.
