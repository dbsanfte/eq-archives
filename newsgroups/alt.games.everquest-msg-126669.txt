MUSLIM FAILS TO STRIKE FEAR INTO HEARTS OF WESTERN OPPRESSORS

UPN- Today, Muhammad Al'jai Jabn was observed failing to commit terrorist 
atrocities.  His neighbors are shocked.  "He always seemed such a nice, 
normal, Muslim.  We could count on him to hang Americans in effigy at 
least hourly."

I'm sorry, but you're not going to see the media (outside of say, 
www.theonion.com) reporting on the hundreds of millions of Muslims who 
don't engage in terrorist activities.  Most of them don't engage in 
terrorist activities -every- -single- -day-.  But that's boring and 
doesn't sell papers.

Why, in the West Bank alone, I would estimate that there are at least  
1,000,000 Muslims who have never (not even once) conducted a suicide 
bombing that killed Israeli citizens.*  But I'm sure that doesn't count as 
walking the walk.  Oh no.

And the fact that the Qu'ran places no more emphasis on the slaughtering 
of unbelievers and heretics than the Bible does?  I'm sure that's not 
relevant either.  Rather, we should generalize about a huge number of 
people and their faith on the basis of what a small minority of their 
people does because it was shocking enough to be on the news.

Just in case you were wondering.
