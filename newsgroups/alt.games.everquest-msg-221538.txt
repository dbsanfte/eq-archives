Depending on how much you want to spend, you may want to look at a
Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement, it will add more hp and stamina to one of
your ear slots.  Off the top of my head i can't think of any bracer you
would want but there are a few out there that you can obtain that have sta
and hit points with decent AC.  Depending on what mobs you are consistently
fighting your AC might be too high (meaning you could trade high ac items
for more sta/hp items.  The WMBS is a nice weapon but for 2 handers you
reach critical mass with a weapon that has a delay of 31+ so you might think
about trading that out.
