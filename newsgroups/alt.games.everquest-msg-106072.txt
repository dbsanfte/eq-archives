Think of it as a size XXXXL t-shirt that rolls up into a "small" wad for
storage.

It will fit into a small bag, but can you imagine what would happen if you
were a 3-foot tall halfling and you tried to wear it?

You wouldn't be able to draw your weapons; your arms would get tangled when
you tried to cast; and when it came time to run away, you'd be tripping all
over yourself at SoW speeds, with the mobs laughing as they pounded you to
your bind point.

I think that about sums it up.
