> 1. At what levels is it the easiest for Wizards to solo?

Easiest? 65 :) Well, as soon as you get your first snare (Bonds of Force) at
29, it gets much easier, and quadding becomes possible. Prior to Bond of
Force, wizards can be frustrating to solo. Nuke, root, back up,
repeat. I never had KEI when I was doing those painful levels, which would
have made it go faster, at least.

SolRo wizards are KoS in the Plane of Growth. I don't know if you care :)

Stats wise, it's pretty marginal. Gnomes have a 5 point higher Sta and a 6
point higher int. Also, their newbie items are pretty nice (if you plan on
doing the newbie armor stuff), if difficult to camp for...
