Individual lines get quoted.

With some newsreaders/editors, long paragraphs are entered as long
individual lines without hard line breaks in them, relying on the newsreader
to do the word wrapping when the message is read.  In a GUI environment,
this is just fine.  The paragraph will resize as the window resizes.

But when replying to a post, some newsreaders will just quote the
individual line and then wrap the rest of it.  The wrapped lines don't have
the quote character prepended.

Not really a bug, but it is a quirk.

Not much you can do about it, either.
