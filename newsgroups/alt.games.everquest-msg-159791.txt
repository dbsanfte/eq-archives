Yeah this isn't likely. Even with half the numbers of people, this is
still a good money maker. If you consider new revenue streams with EQ2
and Galaxies, EQ will be around a while.

No not really, IMHO. More zones for the same number of people. Hard to
tell without data though.

Lots of twinks and alts though...

There is a grind, every racing to be 65. I more enjoy accomplishing
things in Norrath.

That too. People were KSing light light green werewolves from the
20somthing players so they can loot a +1 cape. It was sad.

What server are you on? On morell Thule I seem to always have this
problem too. The one pickup group that is in a dungeon I want to check
out seems to be utterly clueless about tactics!

One guy is always fearing/AOEing/Overpulling while another spends
thier time running for the zoneline. Another complains about being
lost, and another perpetually AFK.

My guild is usually pretty good about grouping though heheeh
