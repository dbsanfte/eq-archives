    Stop. We're talking a level 37 to 41 pet versus a level 41 to 45 pet.
It's not just the difference in max damage output. In a group I imagine
you'd be going after what, level 40ish mobs? Do you think the fire pet is
going to be hitting much against mobs that are even and higher to it? That's
where the real damage difference comes in.

    If Jobaber can land a long-lasting root on an even con with multiple
melees all pounding on the target, that is. It's a much bigger problem at
lower levels, when the pet is closer in levels to the mobs and lands more
roots. And when players are less educated and don't know how to work root
aggro. :-)

    You may want to re-visit that assumption. I always like how a pet with
root can show players with poor positioning that they're too close, for
example! And again - it's very level-dependent. If the 51 mage was soloing
min-blue mobs that run in Sol B, root could get annoying. If the same mage
was grouped in Velk's against highly MR level 45-49 spiders that never run,
I'd want the highest level pet possible so it would have a chance of
hitting.

    Cleric tells the group, "Main tank - nose pinned to the mob's body!
Everyone else, back up!"
