Lets see.  They are taking in, at 450,000*12.95, $5,827,500/month.
Almost SIX MILLION BUCKS.  If you think their costs on a monthly basis
are even half that you are crack fiend.

Lets look at what we get for that money:

Declining, to the point of almost non existance, GM support.  The last
time I needed one it took me three weeks to get no-drop items restored
that poofed from corpse looting.  Nice service.

Incompetent coders.  Each patch breaks something.  Yay!

No internal testing.  Related to the above.  They have a Test server,
but they dont test stuff themselves.  This makes for tons of broken and
imbalanced shit.

The servers dont run 24/7.  Not even close.  Zones crash all the time,
servers crash too.  They have lost data on my server, Tribunal, at least
twice.  TOTALLY LOST THE DATA.

I am sure the cost of maintaining the game has gone up, but christ so
has the number of subscribers, by a *hell* of a lot more.

MMORPGs, EQ especially, are cash cows.  Why do you think there are
dozens in development?  This game is a liquid cash hose for SOE.
