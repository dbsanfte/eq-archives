Think your dodge is capped at 160 (my Warrior's is) actually I thought it
was 150 or something and lower than a Warriors but if yours is 160 I must be
mistaken, I can't see it capping higher.

Isn't parry one of the skills that can be raised with greens? You just need
one to keep attacking you? If so that would be better than standing toe2toe
with an unslowed blue for any length of time.
If not then maybe try duel a friends Pet that cons blue and let it bit the
crap out of you then back off, you heal and it does it again, you do get
skill raises when fighting pets in duels.
