Dear EverQuest European / U.K. Players,

You will be able to get Planes of Power on or around the same date that it's
being released in the US by purchasing from our Online store. In addition,
you will be able to get an upgrade through UbiSoft reasonably shortly after
the US release (the exact date is as yet unannounced, but it will be
shortly). We are working out the details now and will have more information
this week. We will also make sure the pricing is reasonable if purchased
through our online store.

We apologize if there has been any confusion.


Thanks,

- The EverQuest Team
