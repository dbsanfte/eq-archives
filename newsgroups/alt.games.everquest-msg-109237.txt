If you can afford to LOSE $175 (and you may well lose it, forget whether or
not it is worth spending real cash on an item in game) then go for it.
My question is, why would you want one?
I obviously know what the Fungi is, so no giving me stats for it or telling
me the HP regen rate, I mean why do you want one so bad you are willing to
spend that much cash on it?
I could, sort of, understand if you were out of plat and someone was selling
some high end resist gear that you really needed for a raid and needed fast
but afaik the fungi has never been an essential item for anything (other
than "uber" twinking)
