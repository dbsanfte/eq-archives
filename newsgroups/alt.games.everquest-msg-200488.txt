There is an item that tinkers can make to stop the rain if you want to be
able to control it.

It is true that only Druids have a Spell to stop that rain but it takes a
lot of time to load the spell and cost an opal to cast. I don't know any
Druids that would keep the spell up all the time for the ability to stop the
rain. Some druids don't use the spell do to the cost of the opal needed.

> Is it only Karana Druids that get this then?
All Druids can cast the spell not only Karana Druids.

> And does it also work on snow?
No it don't work on anything but rain.
