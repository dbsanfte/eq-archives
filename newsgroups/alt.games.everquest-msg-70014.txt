It is not that bad...the big problem is the stupid spell book, but all
casters deal with that.

You've got to learn what to fight when soloing.  You need mobs whose
hitpoints are within what you can deal with...without snare and/or
fear, we aren't really good at pausing a fight to med, so we need to
find things that we can kill with one bar of mana.

You've got to learn that AC *is* important to a wizard.  With decent
AC, mobs miss 30 percent of the time or so, meaning you have a much
better chance of getting them re-rooted, to either back off and nuke
some more, or to run away.
