Yeah, I've seen tards complain about people calling out for groups, but 
you can bet that when someone says something, it's likely because you're 
doing far more often than "once in 30 minutes". Use /lfg. It works for me 
with an occasional /shout.

Oh, and every time you see someone else /shout out for a group, don't 
spam yours right after. That's bad form. I'm just sayin'...

Join the club, well except for the shitty rl part.

My experience has been that people often have a hard time filling groups. 
If they're passing you over, there must be a reason, especially when 
you're a DPS class.

Turn on /lfg and go do something else. Makes all the difference in the 
world.
