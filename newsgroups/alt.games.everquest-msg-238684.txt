One more thing...I didn't have to say, this email address is the one
registered at the site...Anyone that visits the site can plainly see. The
email address is listed on the main page and in several other areas of the
site...As for the kids that hide behind their monitors and seem to have
everything figured out...they will never be satisfied. I don't want those
kind of people as members, so this post wasn't intended for you. It is
intended for mature people with the interest in exploits and bugs. If you
aren't one of those people, then avoid my site at all costs.
