In group play (post newbee) there are several things that indicates a pourly
played class. What *defines* bad play per class? Here is my short list, but
I havn't played all clases yet, so please feel free to add more / modify

Bard: 
- No Heal/mana song when group is unengaged

Beastlord:
- Unengaged pet

Cleric:
- Not buffing at least MT

Druid:
- No snare on target in agro enviroment

Enchanter:
- Not mezzing adds
- Not mana/haste buffing

Mage:
- Unengaged pet

Monk:
- Not announcing when mend is up

Necromancer:
- Using fear in high agro enviroment

Paladin:
- ??

Ranger:
- ?? no arrows

Rouge:
- Not opposing MT

SK:
- ??

Shaman:
- Not slowing melee mobs

Warrior:
- Not taunting before breaking mezz

Wizzard:
- Nuking before agro is established

As you can see, its difficult for me to define in respect to hybrids, as
they tend to have various roles, beeing a mix between pure classes.
