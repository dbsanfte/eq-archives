My lvl 10 druid made the trip, i did use some invis on parts of the
way, but i never travelled to freeport, i kept on going to velious and
thurgadin for a nice trip, never bound in freeport either, heck of a
corpse run that could have been :)

And i passed kiticor forest between 10 - 11pm no problems (luck i
guess)
