I don't agree with the amount of downtime you're suggesting for low
level EQ1 characters, but that aside, yes, EQ2 has less downtime, but
even if it had no downtime at all (which is not true) it would still
be taking way more than twice as long per level and I'm still talking
about a L25 EQ2 character vs a L43 EQ1.

Remember its not a completely new game after I ding. I may not see all
of it in just L25, but believe me I have seen all of it from L20-30.

I agree, make it slow enough so that they will 1. see the content, and
2. learn to play well enough to build on later, but EQ2 takes it too
far. Much too far.
