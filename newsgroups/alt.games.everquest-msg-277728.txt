Grimlings.

It's more complex than that, actually.  And pretty neat to tweak
around with, too.  I *think* this is how it works:

Each of the three groups starts out owning a different part of the zone.
Every once in a while one of them sends a bunch of special mobs to attack
another group, which spawns a set of special defending mobs.  The
defenders always win, unless players go in and tip the balance.

Once players help an attack succeed, one group is wiped out of the zone.
Then the group that controls only 1/3 of the zone periodically attacks
one of the two places that the other group holds, only now the attacker
always wins.  So which group it is that controls 2/3 will change, but
only back and forth between the two groups still present.

I'm not sure how you get a group to control all three locations -- maybe
just make sure the attacker fails?  But once that happens, not only does
that group stay in control of all three mob areas, they also take over
the Shar Vahl outpost; the guards and merchants run away and hide.
That's when you have to kill the leader to reset the zone.

What this usually meant for me was that if I went there to hunt grimlings
for acrylia (with a character who could also get xp while doing it),
some high level tradeskiller would turn up and make the zone be filled
with owlbears so he could farm something or other. :-)
