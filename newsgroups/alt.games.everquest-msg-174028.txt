On this note, I like Best Buy because I can take their price to
Electronic Boutique and have them price match.  Thanks to Best Buy, I
have saved money at my local Electronic Boutiques.  And yes, I do get
to return games.  I don't abuse the return right either.  I only
return for programs that won't run and major suckage titles for the
most part.  Occational borderline titles will get returned also.
