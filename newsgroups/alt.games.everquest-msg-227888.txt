why shouldnt i be noble? i *am* a cleric of mith marr...altruism is part 
of the character i role play. RP is *supposed* to be a part of why we 
play EQ with people instead of wanking off on a computer game in our 
rooms alone.

just like other than a transport to the body an back to pok i dont 
charge for rezzing either, though for some dungeons i do request they 
drag to the zone line. if you are 'fighting for the benefit of norrath' 
it is something my cleric would do to preserve the good...

and chr!st on a crutch, you do remember this is a game? is having that 
wis augment really going to solve world pollution, get me laid at night 
and make my breath minty fresh? sheesh. and i though i didnt have a life.

aru
makes me glad i am sending more time with hubby before he goes to 
afghanistan in january and avoiding in game group idiocy by just duoing 
with him. I would hate to end up in a group where getting every plat is 
so d@mnedably important.
