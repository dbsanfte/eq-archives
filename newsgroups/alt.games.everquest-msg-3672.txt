The major problem with the Wurmslayer is the weight I have a Dwarf Paladin
and I love the weapon but I group with the same people most of the time
someone must have a end fatiuge (invigor or whatever)spell in your group you
will drain your STA and be fatiuged half way through a battle without an
invigor spell of some sort you are basically useless. If I am soloing even
though I have the invigor spell I will use my mirth 2HS a little faster and
I can finish a fight without being exuasted. STA recovers very quickly and
most if not all healers have some sort of invigor but it is something else
you have to keep an eye on, other then that it is great.
