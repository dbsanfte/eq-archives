Level 51:
Regen Rate (Human): 5 sitting, 2 standing
Regen Rate (Iksar): 12 sitting, 6 standing

Level 56:
Regen Rate (Human): 6 sitting, 3 standing
Regen Rate (Iksar): 16 sitting, 10 standing

Level 60:
Regen Rate (Human): 7 sitting, 4 standing
Regen Rate (Iksar): 18 sitting, 12 standing

I think regen is a huge downtime reducer. Regen races get hit
with an exp penalty for it but I think the trade off is worth it.
From a day to day basis I'd rather have to kill more, than to sit more.
The play is the thing.
