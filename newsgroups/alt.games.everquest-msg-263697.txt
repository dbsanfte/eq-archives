Really? Whats the alternative? You'd prefer to see every last mouse on 
the planet exterminated. You think that's practical? Defending *that* 
statement would be retarted.

Your accusing Kerry of sounding retarded for making a practical 
statement. Meanwhile if he said he'd like to eliminate terrorism from 
the face of the earth you'd probably parade him around like a naive 
idiot for suggesting the impossible. The man can't win because you'll 
spin no matter what he says into absurdity.

Terrorism can't be eliminated completely. You should know that, I do 
know that, and Kerry knows that. So the best you can do is reduce it to 
a nuisance... just like mice. He's not suggesting some of them be 
spared, he's not saying that a nuisance level of terrorism is a good 
thing. He simply understands that you can't just eliminate terrorists, 
no more than you can just eliminate mice or cockroaches. And he also 
understands that reducing them to a nuisance level is both achievable, 
and a world of improvement over what we have now.
