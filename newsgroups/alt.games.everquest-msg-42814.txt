You can get from level 1 to 60 without ever leaving the continent of
Faydwer.  Faydwer is especially nice at lower levels.

Level 1-4, no reason to leave the Steamfont newbie area.
Level 5-12 there's Steamfont, Greater Faydark, Crushbone (to about level
15), and Butcherblock
Level 13-30ish, Dagnor's Cauldron (to about 23) & Unrest.
Level 19-40ish, Castle Mistmore.
Level 40+, Kedge Keep (ok, this one's a stretch...the zone kinda sucks
unless you have a reason to be there)
