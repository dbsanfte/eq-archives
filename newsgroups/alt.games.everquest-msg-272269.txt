My wife and I moved from EQ to EQ2.  Then when I whined so much about
how poorly EQ2 performed on my machine my wife bought us WoW.  Now we
are having a "love the one you're with" experience: when we've been
playing EQ2, we're into the tradeskills, exploring, grouping with
others, etc.  We can play EQ2 for a week w/o even thinking about WoW.
Then we fire up WoW and as oldtime warcraft 2 / 3 players we are
really enjoying the Warcraft experience: nice storyline, great
performance, no zoning, great directed quests.  I don't know that I
have the time to keep playing both of these, but it's sure going to be
hard to choose.

As far as server issues, I'd have to say WoW has been rock solid when
I've been on.  No lag at all.  I'd say Blizzard did a pretty darned
nice job.
