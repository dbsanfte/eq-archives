Well not totally nerfed, but at first you ALWAYS got a blue diamond,
black sapph or diamond it seemed (mirror of the godlike mob possible
gem drops table sort of) Now you can get star rose quartz or some
sulfur thing or other junk too. So really it was too good to be true
at first but some people got lucky for a bit. I tried like 3 or 4 more
times and got the star rose quartz or sulfur junk like every time..
ahaha. Kind of a lot of work for that though I hear people still get
BDS some times.
