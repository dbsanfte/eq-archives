Yep it is against the rules.
IMHO could care less if it was or wasn't against the rules.

Why not just hack the game make yourself GOD mode, never-ending platinum,
mana and health.

Then after 30 minutes get bored quit and leave.
No challenge = No game.

Young children while playing card games often cheat. Well mine did ).
My response was to simple say OK you win. You win the next game too. And the
one after that.
Soon they decide the fun isn't the winning its the playing.
YMMV
