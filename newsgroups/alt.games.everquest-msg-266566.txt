Which is why i suggest people from here try to go to Antonia Bayle if you do
change games. Personal interaction is what makes everquest fun. Frankly, I
wish my voice was able to be piped over the connection so that i could chat
and fight, but i don't imagine Aussies would have the bandwidth for the next
decade, and occasional video conferences or (*gasp*) IRL meets would, IMHO,
cement a better bond between people than the current setup.

I knew quite a few people in one of my old guilds who had all worked
together, and it tends to be the people who meet irl who stick things out
together the longest. In another guild most of the players were american and
at least had the option of travelling to see each other. I used to play a
few roleplaying games and battletech and one of the highlights of the year
was the conventions. That's the pity of the server system; the handicaps on
server transference (quite artificial IMO) make it hard to rockup to some
place and gang up on a dragon. I've seen a lot of computer game clusters
being set up in cinemas and even a cafe; it's a shame that mmog in many
countries is not represented, I know you can game that way with lineage in
korea (or so i am told).

Anyway, back to the point. I doubt I would ever meet up with the ppl I have
spoken to here IRL but perhaps if people are in eq2 and we use the same
server we can form a de-facto guild of considerable size? Maybe we can't
raid together but we could support each other in other ways and discuss
common issues, and maybe resolve issues with less agro than i have seen with
guild disputes in eq1.

Brett Caton,

still waiting on his pre-ordered game (sigh)
