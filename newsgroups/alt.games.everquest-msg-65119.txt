  You don't need the expansion to play, only to access expansion content
(the new zones, the new race, the new class).  Though people are having a
lot of technical difficulties now, and a lot of systems have been rendered
obsolete by the DX8 engine upgrade, so you still might not be able to get in
and play right.

  Good luck.
