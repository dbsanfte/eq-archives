you havent been giving in 4 sets of 4 have you? I was doing this thinking it
would be ok but noticed i only got 1 faction increase msg for 16 bats wings
then started giving 1 per slot instead and got the same faction hit for four
batswings I seemed to get to amiable pretty quick and didnt use all the
second lot of wings I brought.
Hes still a rude mofo though i hope he chokes on his shopping.
