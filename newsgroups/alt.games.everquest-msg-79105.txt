I appreciate the answer and the info, Anyone. As I've said in previous
posts, I will NEVER do it again. I was sorry almost immediately, and not
just because my account may get banned, but also because I don't do that. I
have no idea why it hit me as it did last night, but I'll set up a hotkey so
that from now on I can curse people in a way that isn't offensive. If my dad
were still alive, he'd be threatening to wash my mouth out. And I'd deserve
it.

thanks,
Darklet
