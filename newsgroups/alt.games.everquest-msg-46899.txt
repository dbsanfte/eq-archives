Or, to give you a better answer...

TLC means that if you don't get xp for a monster, you don't get any
items from that monster.  If you're in a group, if the lowest ranked
member of the group doesn't get xp (hence, noone in the group gets
xp), you don't get items from the kill, either.

It was put in as a way to stop high level people from farming low
level areas to get the good stuff there, thereby leaving it for the
people that it was made for.

In general, NO ONE likes it.
