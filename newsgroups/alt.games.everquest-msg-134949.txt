EQWindows, sorry, don't know the website.  A friend of mine plays two copies
of EQ (2 accounts) on one computer at once.  EQ is relegated to a window
(like NORMAL programs) so that you can do other stuff on that computer while
you're playing.

I have 3 EQ computers and a 4th I haven't gotten around to setting up yet
(gotta buy another monitor, so I haven't tried the program yet.  I hate EQ
hackers and cheaters (of which there are almost NONE), but I don't have a
problem with this program.
