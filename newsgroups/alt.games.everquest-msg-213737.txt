ahh.  

Actually, I hate it when enchanters tash before slowing in my groups.
The extra time they need to wait before slowing (because of aggro 
management) and the extra hate that often results in pulling the mob
out of positions (why do so many casters stand with their backs into
a wall?) are huge negatives.  Especially given that I start casting
malosini just as the tank engages.  As you know, the malo line is 
extraordinarly low aggro for what it does, malosini has a very short
cast time and makes tash really unneeded on xp mobs.
