Sorta.

When you put an initial point into any new skill, your skill is set to your
level.  So when you put the initial point into Research, your Research skill
was set to 16.

The catch is that Research is level capped at (Level-15)*5.  So the cap at
level 16 is 5, and at 17 is 10.  And you have a skill of 16.

This means you won't be able to gain skill in Research until level 19 (cap
is 20) and then you'll only be able to put 4 points into it.  After that,
you'll be able to put 5 points per level.

My advice is to forget about the practice runes.  They really aren't worth
the trouble.  Just dump 5 points into Research at the trainer every level.
