I understand the difference between auto and semi-auto.

Do you really believe the only reason the army use M-16s instead of
revolvers is the ability to go to full auto?

This is from another thread where Anthony C. Nelson says differently about
the capability of the current M-16

M16's no longer have full auto.  3 round burst.


Will they now be issuing bags of revolvers to Marines, now that there is no
longer full auto on an M-16?

I doubt very much that you could kill 12 people in 15 secs wirh a lever
action 22, fortunately there is no way of proving this..

It also leads to the question.... why don't they issue lever action .22s as
a standard military weapon anywhere in the world?
