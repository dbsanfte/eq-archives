Version 1:

You play a Mage for a while.  You like it.  You come to the selection point
and pick Summoner (?).  You like it.  You come to the final selection point.
You pick Conjurer (elemental summonings).

Version 2:

You pick Evil.  You play a Mage for a while.  You like it.  You come to the
selection point and pick Summoner.  You like it.  You come to the final
selection point.  You *cannot* pick Conjurer.  You ruled it out the instant
you chose Evil as your alignment, whether you knew it or not.


I'm not the OP who complained, but I do understand the problem.  The use of
Alignment to restrict what subclass choices are available means that if
you're after a particular branch, you've chosen your subclass the instant
you've picked your alignment, and conversely if you want a particular
subclass you must choose the alignment that leads to it.

Now, in a few classes this is appropriate.  Specifically, Paladin and
Shadowknight.  However, why is it considered a requirement for a Conjurer?
What is it about summoning elementals and sending them off to die in your
place that says "I must be Good to do this"?
