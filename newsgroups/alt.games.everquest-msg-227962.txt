    The other Quarm guild on our server took a month to kill him from when
they bagged Saryrn/Terris, because of that. It took them a further two
months to get VZ, same reason. At least you don't lose many people on an
aborted attempt!

    Yeah, five clerics doesn't cut it. I'm sure you know what you need
healing-wise to drop him, and it's quite extensive.

    It's not so bad once you get practice at it. It's sort of like Rallos
Zek in Tactics. The first few times, you hate the event. But after you get
good at it, it's quite painless and quick. And Rathe does help ease the BP
problems for the plate classes.

    Our last Rathe kill didn't even have a full raid. You need good class
balance, but you don't need numbers.

> We clear down to the Rathe Council, and it's very easy.

    Ugh, no wonder you hate it so much. Get a mage and gater keyed and
camped down there so you can CotH. Cuts a lot of wasted time off the event.
Perhaps you could recycle the bots you used to use in Vex Thal to CotH to
the first blob! ;-)

    There's some interesting features of the unmezzables which would
discourage the use of monks, actually. That could be why they aren't pulling
the way you are used to seeing them pulled. When we pull them they come into
camp singly, completely resist debuffed, snared, and without a single point
of damage done to them, and that takes a fairly convoluted process.

    Does that imply spamming fast heals? ;-)

    We use a hybrid. We recognize with our l33t push skills that whatever
comes into camp will have visited all parts of camp by the time we're done
knocking it around, so we set up the groups so everyone has someone to
cure/heal them. We do meet them at the cave mouth like you do, though, and
we do use Divine Stun to get final positioning after mez (at what percent
are you mezzing? can you do better?). Some people try and duck the AE, but I
find what ends up happening is they get creamed by the AE eventually but are
out of range of the incoming group cure.

    I'm always OT 1, or what you'd call seventh Rathe Council. I get the
thrill of being an OT cleric for the longest. ;-)

    We do shaman/cleric/paladin/someone with root and damageless
snare/necromancer/backup tank. Between shaman and myself, the group stays
clean of the AE (RC/RC/WoR, repeat), and mana is almost never an issue.
Having the shaman there also insures that our mob stays debuffed, although
we do need to call for the buff ENC to Tash now and again.

    It sounds immature, and likely it is, but you have no idea what's going
on in their raid chat. It could be that fellow was going lower and lower on
mana, screaming for feed, and getting nothing or even worse being told by
necromancers that they didn't want to feed. Pretty embarassing to let their
drama go into a public channel, though!

    If groups were done right earlier, nobody will have used a MGB to heal
yet. This is an excellent time to start, especially seeing as how many such
heals are manaless. ;-)

    Everyone has different ways of doing things. You'd be surprised, if you
looked at guilds across all servers, as to what each one does differently on
encounters where it seems "obvious" how to do it.
