While I certainly agree that the game could do with more interesting quests
and a lot more quests in general, I think this is a good addition. It fits
right
in with the atmosphere in that area of the world, and in my opinion the
biggest
problem now with EQ is the lack of any atmosphere to the game. Nobody has
any reason to care about their starting city and there is no achievement in
gettin
anywhere any more so anything that adds to the atmosphere of the game is
welcome
