And undermine his efforts...

Imagine the kid who spent his summer working his ass off to get his 
first shield, and then at the end was rewarded by the quest npc a little 
["no drop"] xxx or something, and then some stranger pulls up and says

The kid is going to have a tough time justifying to himself that he 
didn't just completely waste his summer...
