In this case I guess the ignorance of the masses was also an excuse
for his own since turtles are in fact reptiles. Also lizards are
reptiles so you'd not say "neither lizards nor reptiles" since that
would be like saying "neither oranges nor fruit."  

Following is the definition of both where  you can clearly see the
difference:

http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=turtle

(approximately 5 seconds to find)

"rep�tile (rptl, -tl)
n. 
Any of various cold-blooded, usually egg-laying vertebrates of the
class Reptilia, such as a snake, lizard, crocodile, turtle, or
dinosaur, having an external covering of scales or horny plates and
breathing by means of lungs. 
A person regarded as despicable or treacherous. "

http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=amphibian

am�phib�i�an (m-fb-n)
n. 
A cold-blooded, smooth-skinned vertebrate of the class Amphibia, such
as a frog or salamander, that characteristically hatches as an aquatic
larva with gills. The larva then transforms into an adult having
air-breathing lungs. 
An animal capable of living both on land and in water. 
An aircraft that can take off and land on either land or water. 
A tracked or wheeled vehicle that can operate both on land and in
water. 
----------------------------------

So the main difference is that amphibians are smooth skinned and hatch
as aquatic larva with gills while reptiles are rough scaley skinned
and hatch from an egg already in a turtle or lizard or snake state.
