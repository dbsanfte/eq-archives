The Game Cards that are available at retail are good for a 3 month
subscription, but they're not terribly cost-effective once you add on sales
tax and/or shipping.

The only other method they accept is credit/debit card, and that's the next
thing Sony needs to address if they're going to continue to lead this
market, since DAoC and other online games offer other avenues like
Paybycash.com.
