No, they're not. Although they are getting better they're not there yet.

...yes I have. I have all of those settings on my 21" CRT. I set them once 2
years ago and haven't touched them since.
Now I've got one for you. Ever hear of sharpness? ...cause no matter how you
look at it even the best LCD can't compare to a mid-range CRT (not talkin'
about cheapies here) when it comes to a crispness/sharpness. As I said
before, they're getting better, but they're not there yet.

Note: I have done much gaming on both LCD's and CRT's -
Can I game properly on both? Yes. Do I notice a difference while playing?
Rarely. too busy fraggin'. Do I notice a difference if looking at
scenery/walking around? Yes, especially when looking at a 3D landscape that
has some distance to it (like an open field or down a street - sharpness
issue).
I'm just a little spoiled with my 21" of love, yea baby!!! Of course that
21" of love is a royal pain in the @$$ to lug up 3 flights of stairs to a
LAN party...;-)
