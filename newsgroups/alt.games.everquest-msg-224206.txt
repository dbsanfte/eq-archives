I would tend to agree with it not being much use to raise resists at low
levels.  In my experience from way back when, if I found out that a certain
type of mob was doing nasty things to me, it was generally a better option
to just find something else to fight.  In theory, higher resists should
help, but in practice you often have to go overboard on them to get much
practical benefit.
