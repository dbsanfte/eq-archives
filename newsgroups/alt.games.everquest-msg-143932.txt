The FV server is my favorite.

: 1)Do folks actually role-play?

Yes and no.  You get a lot more role playing than normal servers,
but not 100% role playing.

It's less populated than other servers, but not barren to the point
of being a serious problem.

: 3) Any tips from players on FV?

Roll the character you ultimately want the first time.  There is a
one character limit on FV.  I wish there was a 2 character limit
instead, so that people who prefer the FV server have at least a
little bit of variety to look forward to.
