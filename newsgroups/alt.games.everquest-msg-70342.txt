I'm not flaming you, Jazz, I'm just trying to offer a different perspective.

Every post I've seen that echoes the above-quoted sentiment is missing one VERY
important point: the patch message on Dec. 4 stated _clearly_ that Win95 users
could use DX 8.0a and continue to play in the pre-SoL world. That part of the
message was rescinded late in the day on the 4th and Win95 users (myself
included) were blindsided.

What did I do? I upgraded to 98 and put in new sound and video cards. I hadn't
done those things previously because I didn't NEED to. I've been around long
enough to know "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."

I'm fortunate to be able to do what I did to continue to play a game I enjoy.
There are a lot of people who CAN'T, for whatever reason, and are unable
suddenly to enjoy a favorite pastime/hobby/addiction in which they, like you and
I, have invested many hours and have formed friendships. That investment and
those friendships were taken away without warning and recourse. These are the
ones who are hurt and angry. I suspect there are a couple of thousand of them.
