A moron on Prexus said he got "hacked" before and items stolen, and of
course the account got banned.

He took legal action against Sony, and sent logs proving he was at work when
item xx and yy were taken from his account.

But after those 2 items were gone, he proceeded to give all his high-value
droppables to friends, and THEN petition about his "stolen items"

His lawsuit failed because in the end he wasnt banned for account sharing,
he was banned for trying to con the gm's
