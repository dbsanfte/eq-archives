Wow, now I see two servers which train left.  I still can't figure out 
why they would evolve that way, unless the first guild to really work KC 
was British, Aussie, or Japanese.  <shrug>

Congrats!  You'll like VP, though as of last night it appears that pathing 
and aggro has changed slightly.  For the first time dragons were camping 
corpses in the safehall, and even after being trained out to their normal 
wandering path were coming back for 10-15 minutes.  We also noticed that 
it was much harder, if not impossible, to split the dragons from the 
wurms, even with an instant-invis casting SK and all see-invis wurms down.  
I suspect they're getting ready for the VP upgrades that have been 
mentioned.  That would also explain several other guilds on Innoruuk 
camping VP keys pretty seriously now.
The really fun thing about VP is that you don't know which type of wurm is 
adding.  Getting the 1500 hitting wurm with Hoshkar makes things tough, 
getting the regular casting wurm with Silverwing is trivial.
