I posted about this a couple days ago but never saw it so will try again.
Sorry if it is redundant.

Whenever I get on a boat/ship, most of the textures screw up and I can see
through them to the below decks and water below. Also other characters have
a tendancy to disappear and later reappear.  The textures behaved normally
until the May patches, but I guess it is also possible something in  my video
card settings could have changed. Seeing other characters, I think, has 
always been a little flakey.

Can anyone suggest to me what to do or what settings to change to get my 
video working properly again when traveling by boat?  I have a Geforce 2
Ti 200 card. The rest of the game usually looks good.

Thanks for any help.
