Not exactly the same problem, but after I trained a point into wind
instruments, I could not even START the ultravision song...ever. I
clicked it like hundreds of times (well, at least a hundred, no
kidding) and got nothing but missed notes after one bubble on the
casting bar on each attempt. I trained about 15 points into it and
finally got it to start, albeit not very reliably. After sitting
singing the CHA song for a few hours, and getting several skillups, I
noticed a huge difference. This was also with the minotaur horn.
