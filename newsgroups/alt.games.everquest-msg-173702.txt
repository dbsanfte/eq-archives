[Just expanding on what kaev said...]

Basically it means that you profit from every raid you attend, rather
than just the ones you attend when loot useful to you drops. It gives
you an incentive to attend raids where the primary benefit is to
somebody else.

Otherwise (for example) any raid where no useful stuff for clerics
drops will find itself largely bereft of clerics. Ditto warriors.
Or any other core class. It would make almost any epic you care to
name pretty much impossible to complete.

It's a way of balancing out the benefits of attending a raid to be fair
to everyone, not just the classes a raid is "for".
