Actually I have found the experince to be quite good for our guild.  Most of our
guilds main ranged from 35 to 60, so we may be a little higher than some of you are
speaking.  We recently have been discussing things with an uber guild on our server
and it has helped both guilds out.  The ubberguild has a 54 level restriction, so a
few of their alts have come into our guild (to help find the ones they want), and
their guild has helped some of our guys with quests/raids, even ones that have said
they will not change guilds.  It is more of an alliance.  A couple of our level 60
to 55 guys went over, one of our level 54s is thinking about it, but it seems for
the most part their heart is still with us, and they still post of message boards,
help with events and talk to us regurally.  If you see a guild that is very
attracted to one or two of your guys, try to form a mutually benefitial alliance
with them instead of kicking alts out of the guild.  Even if you don't aspire to
killing all the wardens, having some powerful friends and allies is ever a bad
thing.
