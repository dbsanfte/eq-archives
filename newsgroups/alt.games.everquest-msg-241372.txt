I dont know anything about Xnews, but when I logged online this morning 
and sucked down my email accounts, when I went into newsgroups, i got 
the message you get when you first subscribe to a group - the one where 
it tells you there are however many headers and how many do you want to 
download...but yet it didnt do several thousand, it only did the hundred 
or so new ones /boggle. I put it down to internet gremlins.
