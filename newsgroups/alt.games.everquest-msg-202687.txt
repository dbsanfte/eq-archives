Another one is the same place offer to change thier gold/silver/copper into
plat offer 75% for the first haul if you dont have the plat to start since
they would have to trust you, then buy it at 50 - 60% people will be more
than happy to do this. Offer to sell the FS weapons and give them 30% of the
profit and they will hold them all for you as well. I know this is what I
offered to people in EF and got lots of people wanting to do this :)
