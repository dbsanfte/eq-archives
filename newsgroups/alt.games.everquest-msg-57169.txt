I'm not sure what is going on with that server, but I had practically no
lag. A ping of 110 or lower all the time and only rare spikes of <gasp> 5%
packet loss. This in comparison to the last few moths of Vazaelle with a
ping of at least 250 and more normal around 400 and a constant packet loss
of 10-50%.

I did notice a LOT of people having serious lag problems all around me. I
had every member of my group, except me, go linkdead at one time or another.
I know one came from Norway, one from Germany, one from the UK and I myself
from the Netherlands.
There seems to be no real pattern, just luck :)
