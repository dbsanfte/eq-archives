and this type of reply is exactly going to have me not discuss any other 
email addresses i happen to use, or what groups i am on. Deal with it.

I try to be very civil. I dont accuse people of lying. I certainly don't 
waste the time trying to google for a newsgroup denizen on the grounds 
that they probably arent using their main email account. as you can see 
by my earthlink tag, i am using an auto-issue account without bothering 
to change the issued ID.
