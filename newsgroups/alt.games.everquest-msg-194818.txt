I deliberately switch directions as mobs die, personally; it does alleviate the
boredom a bit!

Also helps slow the impending carpal tunneling a bit by using slightly
different muscles.

I read a long post a couple years back stating that a figure 8 should be
adopted, which would somehow allow the bard to twist in one of his AOE DOTs as
he crosses over.  Personally, if I'm close enough for AOE I'm close enough for
one of the mobs to tag me and stun me and I stop moving and the other four eat
me for a light snack.

But perhaps there's something in it, don't Indy cars run in figure eights?
