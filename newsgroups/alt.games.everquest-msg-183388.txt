Currently active:
Verys, 40 necromancer
Shallah, 25 bard
Crathen, 27 rogue
Calris, 51 druid
Drayvis, 20 warrior
Nyllati, 16 mage
Salenah, 15 paladin

There have been a multitude of others varying from levels 10-30 before
being deleted. The count is probably nearly 100. There's not a single
class I haven't played and researched to the best of my ability.
