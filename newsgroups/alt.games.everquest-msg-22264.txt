The next time that happens, if your friend has his LORE item
on him, he can hold the spare for you indefinitely by:

1.  Drop his on the ground.

2.  Loot the one from the corpse.

3.  Every 2-3 minutes (items on the ground decay in five minutes),
    he needs to drop the one he's holding, then pick up the
    one that's been lying on the ground a while.

4.  Repeat until you can arrive and grab yours off the ground.

Note that if he absentmindedly tries to pick up the one on the ground
while he still has one on him, it'll poof, so be careful.
