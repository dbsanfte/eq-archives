Yes your endless list also includes 2 truisms. It is class based, and
once you get to a certain level and get an ability that ability is
yours from then till level 60 and beyond. Why should loot be any
different? If you get to level 30 and don't have time to camp Phatlewt
002 why shouldn't you be able to come back when your 50 and get it. 
You earned the right to that item by putting in the time (and money to
Verant) to get to the level needed. You deserve to be able to get what
you won.
