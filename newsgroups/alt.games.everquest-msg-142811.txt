If the scoundrels spent it wisely, we'd probably need to give a lot
less.

Damn straight. Last two places I worked for went out of business, and
it was clear that I wasn't going to find a job in the near future, so
I hung out a shingle and started my own business. The weird thing is
that while there still aren't many jobs available, I'm having no
trouble getting consulting work.

In fact, there's a good chance I'm going to be almost too busy very
soon.

It's individuals too. I've been paying attention.
