You trained in smithing? You should have trained in jonesing. 

We can fix that. If you go to Kelethin, and go to the treehouse forge,
bring smithing supplies and a stack of ale or short beer. Before
smithing click the beer stack while standing at the edge of the
platform. Make sure you are bound in Paineel before you do that.

Another thing you can do is after you do that climb up a wizard spire.
There is free weapons up there if you jump up when you are at the top.
If you jump enough times you will stick up there with the secret quest
to get Druid epics for your 7th level druid.

By the way, I have the title to the Iceclad bridge, if you would like
to buy it....
