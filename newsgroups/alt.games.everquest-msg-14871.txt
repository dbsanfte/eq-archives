Nah, Dan ... I had PLONKed LG about the time it became obvious that his
paranoia was such that he was still chowing on the food he had hoarded for
Y2K.  I'd go back and snatch the message from the PLONKing, but I've cleared
out since then.  It'll be on Google somewhere.

I thought I'd killed the thread, but apparently I didn't go high enough, and
since I'd cleared it became impossible to kill.  Been lurking it a bit, but
without LG and his boy-toy Titan's posts, it makes it difficult to respond.
I did jump back in when Remington mentioned 'Leather Goddesses of Phobos'
... one of my all-time faves from Infocom.  Although it seems somewhat
tainted now ... <sigh>
