Jeez...I hate articles like this.  Is EQ addicting?  Definitely!

But if it causes you to quit your job/school...abandon your friends and
family...and consider suicide over losing a game character,  it's time for
you to consider therapy.  Don't blame the game for people's
emotional/psychological/mental problems.  If it wasn't EQ, they'd find
something else to obsess on.

Just my 2cp...
