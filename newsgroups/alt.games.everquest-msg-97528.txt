I am trying to get some more Ghulam armour from Kaza Raj up in Shadeweavers,
and he tells me to get "4 carpaces from Cht'Thk Bloodbulks"..

Well.. i have yet to see one.. and of the postings from diff. forums, it
seems like it might be an extremely rare drop?

Is there like a special place these spawn? Up in the hills? Anywhere...
lol.. (Getting frustrated..Although it is not "that" important, but would
like to do the quest to really have done them all here.. right?"

So.. Anyone?
