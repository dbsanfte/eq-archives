The "official strategy guide" is wrong in so many places.  This is just one
of them.

This is from a post Brad McQuaid made on the old EQ message boards:

DEX: how quickly you learn weapon skills; how often weapon will proc; how
     quickly you learn rogue skills; how hard you hit with bows

STR: determines how much you can carry; influences how quickly you learn many
     offensive skills

STA: affects how many hit points you have, how long you can hold your breath

INT: directly affects how quickly you can learn most skills; affects the
     amount of mana for bards and all mages, as well as shadow knights

WIS: affects the amount of mana the priest classes have, also rangers; also
     affects how quickly you can learn many skills if your wisdom is higher
     than INT.

CHA: affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC merchants, and how
     much they will pay you; affects the saving throw on certain bard and
     enchanter spells (charms in particular)

AGI: affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills, how difficult
     it is to hit you as well as how much damage you take when you are hit
