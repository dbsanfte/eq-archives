There are still some updates I am working on... I've been busy with real-
life stuff.  Please reply to the FAQ or send me an email regarding
corrections.  Thanks, Lev.

   Please read the FAQ.  The FAQ ideally will keep you from introducing
 yourself with an annoying question.  Questions should be posted only when
 the FAQ, game manuals, or related web sites do not contain the information
 you need or are unclear.

   Read the eqmanual_supplement.doc in the EverQuest program
directory/folder
 on your computer. Special note all versions of EQ have a 'printable' copy
 of the eqmanual_supplement.doc. But still theres lots of good information
 in it.

2.    Questions about Everquest
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2.1    Q: What is Everquest?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A: EverQuest is a real 3D massively multiplayer online RPG. Another
 equally accurate way of describing EverQuest is to call it a graphical
 MUD (Mulit-User Dimension/Dungean). A text based multi-player game.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    2.2    Q: What do I need to play Everquest?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A: System Requirements

  450 MB+ hard drive space

    You will also need a valid credit card.

    Note: Win95 is nolonger supported.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    2.3    Q: What are these expansions I keep hearing about?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A: There have been three expansion packs to EverQuest so far, the
        Ruins of Kunark, the Scars of Velious, and Shadows of Luclin.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    2.4    Q: What is the Ruins of Kunark?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A: The Ruins of Kunark was the first EverQuest expansion to be
 released. This expansion included a new continent with many new zones
 to adventure in, lots of new dungeons, items, mobs, quests and spells,
 and also included a new playable race of characters, the Iksar lizard-
 men.  People with this expansion also were allowed to advance beyond
 level 50 (up to level 60,) which was previously impossible.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    2.5    Q: What is the Scars of Velious?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A: The Scars of Velious is an expansion similar to the Ruins of
 Kunark, including another new continent with new zones, dungeons,
 items, mobs, quests, spells, level 60 cap, ect. but it is geared
 towards higher level players (level 30+) and does not include a new
 playable race.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    2.6    Q: What is the Planes of Power?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A: The Planes of Power is the latest expansion to EverQuest. It
 was released on October 21, 2002. It has made the following changes
 to EverQuest:

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    2.7    What is EQ Macros and where can I get it?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A: EQMacros is a program which is no longer available. The purpose
 of this program was to provide a means whereby users could circumvent
 some of the more tedious aspects of the game. It also dispensed with
 some of the disadvantages certain characters had, such as night
 blindness.

       Verant has required that the author of EQMacros cease distribution,
 and has stated that anyone caught using it will have their account
 banned.

       This is a controversial subject in this newsgroup, and has been
 argued to death. Posting questions on this subject is generally
 frowned upon. Further information can be found at www.xylobot.com

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    2.8    Where are the Everquest servers located?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A: The entire EverQuest (EQ) universe (at present, 40 separate
 worlds) is run on approximately 1,000 servers. These are located in
 an onsite datacenter and at AT&T CERFnet (in San Diego, less than a
 mile from our offices). The mix is about 60/40 (here vs. AT&T CERFnet)

     The Antonius Bayle server is located in the UK.

     Note: Information is being updated.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    2.9    What is Everquest Legends?
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    A: Everquest Legends is a series of new servers that are coming on
 line. The Stormhammer server is the first EQ Legends Server to go
 live. VI has limited the number of accounts to 8,000. They have decided
 to allow character transfers once every six months (at no cost). VI
 also announced that they have hired additional GM staff so that they
 have 24hr staffing. The cost for using the EQ Legends server is
 39.95 billed every month. This gives you access to all of the servers.
 Unfortunately you can not use 'Game Cards' for the new servers.
 Check out http://legends.everquest.station.sony.com/showcase/home.jsp
 for a virtual tour. The following are some of the new features that
 are available:

 **Character Pages: Part of the Legends web site, each player character
 will have a personal homepage featuring all the character's statistics
 and items. It will be updated daily by the EverQuest Legends server.
 Also included is a personal journal in which you'll be able to record
 achievements and victories in the world of Norrath, open quests,
 accomplishments, future wants, current friends and enemies, and share
 your adventures with others. You control what is and isn't noted there.

 **Dynamic Server: The Customer Service & Development staff will not
 only be providing in-game support but also running new quests and
 adventures for players of all levels to participate in. While you may
 not see a GM at every log in, with dynamic content ongoing throughout
 each day, you are sure to be caught up in the weave of stories and
 events. Orcs invading Freeport? Gnolls rampaging through the Karanas?
 Or maybe a new dragon emerges from his ages-old slumber to ravage the
 countryside.

 **Legendary Items: New 'Legendary' items will be introduced on these
 servers before anyother servers get to see them.

 **Calendar of Events: With all this great stuff going on, you're going
 to need a way of keeping track of it all. That's where the Legends
 Calendar comes into play. This web-based calendar will be kept up to
 date by the Legends Team, and will let you know who, when, where, and
 what is going on server-wide. You'll be able to organize and list your
 own events for other Legends players to see, or search through the
 listings to find other exciting, player-run events to participate in.

 **Interactive Maps: New dynamic maps help chart the travels of your
 character with step by step tracking of your progress through the
 world of Norrath and beyond. Quickly find which zone your character
 is bound in, and which zones you have or haven't visited. As these
 maps progress, more detail and dynamic features will be added to
 assist your exploration of Norrath.

 **Guild Halls: Membership to the Legends Service will provide you a
 one stop website for all of your Guild needs. This new service
 includes a guild calendar, message board, member roster, and pages to
 post guild news, the guild history, and more! Everything you need to
 manage your Guild and its activities. Setting up that next Plane raid,
 or perhaps just organizing a Guild wedding? The Guild Hall will give
 you all the flexibility and tools that you will ever need.

3.    Questions about gameplay
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3.1    Q: What is the best race/class combo to play
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A: To answer this question you have to ask yourself what is
 important to you. If you're familiar with other RPGs and games of
 this nature, you probably know that each character will have his or
 her strengths and weaknesses, and that no single class/race combo
 will give you all the good with none of the bad.  The question to
 ask is not what is the best race/class combo is the best, but to
 ask which is best for YOU.  The best way to answer this question is
 to learn about all of the classes and races, and make your decision
 based on that knowledge.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3.2    Q: Is there any way for me to change the deity I worship, or to
  become Agnostic?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A: No, sorry.  The only way you can "change" your deity is to
 delete your character and start over.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3.3    Q: I would like to change my character's name, how do I do it?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A: You can have your character's name changed by paying a $49.95
       fee per request with can consist of no more than eight characters.
 Also, your character must have the following qualifications:

  * First names only are eligible for this service.
  * Characters eligible for rename must be level 6 or higher.
  * You may rename a character only once every six months.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3.4    Q: I want to transfer one character from one EverQuest account I
       have to another.  Can I do this, and if so, how?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       A: Yes, you can, for a $50.00.Full details can be found at
      https://store.station.sony.com/eq_char_moves/index.jsp
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3.5    Q: How do I alt+tab out of EverQuest and return to the game?  It
        would really be helpful if I could use Notepad or the web
       while I'm playing?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       A: Unfortunately, in an effort to make it more difficult for
 somebody to hack their client software, Verant has disabled effective
 alt+tabbing in EverQuest.  It is possible to Alt+Tab out of EverQuest
 (as you may discover if you accidentally do so), but it is impossible
 to get back into the game.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3.6    Q: What is a hotkey?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       A: A key that is customized to perform an in-game function

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3.7    Q: How do I make a hotkey?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       A: Open your "Options Window" while in the game. Select the
 Keyboard tab. On the drop down menu, select all. In the textarea
 below the drop down menu will be listed all the possiblities for
 your hotkeys.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3.8    Q: How do I make a spell a hotkey?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       A: See FAQ: 3.7, the spell casting options are listed in the
 Keyboard Tab in the Options Window.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3.9    Q: What is a social?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       A: Making a social allows you to execute line commands and say
 predefined phrases with a single keystroke.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3.10   Q: How do I make a social?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       A: On the main screen, press the Socials button.  Several buttons
 will appear with pre-made social key commands.  You can edit a hotkey
 by right-clicking it.  To edit a line of a social, just click it and
 start typing.  You can edit the name of the social in the same manner.
 When you finish, you can make your social into a hotkey.  When you
 activate the social, it will execute whatever you typed in on the
 lines of the social key.  For example, you can make a social that
 looks like this:

        /afk
        /groupsay I'm going away from keyboard for a sec, guys.

   And if you activated this social key, it would flag you AFK, and
 you'd tell your group "I'm going away from keyboard for a second,
 guys."

      Any "line command" (command that starts with a slash) can be used
 in a social.  There are even a few commands that are specifically
 intended for use in socials.  For more information on these commands
 and others, read the eqmanual_supplement.doc in your EverQuest
 directory.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3.11   Q: How do I make my character say those cool sayings when
               meditate or pull a Mob to my group by using a Hotkey?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       A: Want you actually need to do is create what is called a MACRO.
 This is down just like the social with an added step.

   Lets say you want to make a button that every time you sit
 down to meditate you send out a group say "I'm oom! I must sit and
 meditate for more mana..." Go to your Actions Window, select the
 social icon tab, left click on the right or left arrow button until
 you find a blank button. Right click on the blank button. A new
 window will pop up. The Text Field in the upperleft will be the text
 visible on the button. You can select the color of teh text on the
 right. The five text fields below are for your command lines. With
 our example the commands lines will look like this:

 Field 1: /sit
 Field 2: /g I'm OOM! I must meditate for more mana.
 Field 3:
 Field 4:
 Field 5:

   Then select the accept button. Notice that the remaining fields are
        left blank. You can be as creative as you want. Just remember that
 some groups get tired of the saying over and over. Now that you have
 defined you button we move on to making the Hotkey.

   Right Click and Hold over the the button you created. It will
 appear in your cursor now. Release the mouse button and go to your
 HotBox Window. Left click on the empty space where you want to place
 your button. Now go to the Keyboard Tab in the Options Window
 (FAQ: 3.7), and change the Hot Key for the Hot Box Button.

   If you use the /pause 1 (or other number 1 - 9) it will make it
 wait for the number of 'ticks' before executing the next command
 line. This is helpful when you have multiple spells listed in the
 hotkey. And now you have made your own Macro.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3.12    Q: Where can I get an up-to-date list of commands and/or emotes?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       A: Try the In-Game Help window. There is a detailed list of every
  valid command. They are also divided up into categories.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3.13    Q: What are all these abbreviations and acronyms?  What does it
   all mean?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       A: This site has an excellent glossary
 http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqglossary.htm

 The Jargon Lexicon
   http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/The-Jargon-Lexicon.html

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3.14    Q:Where should I hunt at my particular level/class/race?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       A: The following sites have good charts on this.
      http://www.eqatlas.com/huntguidelevel.html
      http://everquest.allakhazam.com/zones/Level_Chart.html

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3.15    Q:Why can mobs hit through walls?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       A: I was happily trading inside a vendors shop, when suddenly I died
 seeing 'A Griffon hits you for 300dmg... loading, please wait...' -
 WTF?......

       Mobs and other NPCs in EQ are controlled by computer AI, which is
 no substitute for a <supposedly> intelligent human being controlling
 an avatar. Monsters all behave according to strict rules on pathing,
 aggro-range etc, and don't really employ sophisticated tactics and
 strategy in the same way a human player would. To avoid unbalancing
 the game, Verant have opted to give mobs an 'unfair' advantage - they
 can hit through walls, they ignore the z-axis of 3D space to hit from
 a long way above or below a player, and generally have the ability to
 hit back from seemingly unreachable locations. This is to avoid ex-
 ploits like getting easy experience by raining down spells or arrows
 on a mob from a location which that mob (because of it's programmed
 pathing) cannot reach. Pet using classes may gain some satisfaction
 from the knowledge that their pets have the same unfair advantages as
 other mobs, and can hit back at that pesky monster whacking you from
 under the ground...

 In addition, Mobs can do other things that PCs can not such as:

   Mobs can teleport to you if they get stuck on something also known
    as warping.
   Mobs regenerate mana standing up and at a MUCH faster rate than PCs
           can sitting down meditating.
   All Mobs can breath underwater and never drown.
   All Mobs take zero damage from falling, no matter the height.
   All mobs are immune to lava damage, if they fall into it.
   A Mob can hit a PC if the PC is standing inside them,
    A PC cannot hit the Mob.
   PCs cannot shoot mobs with missile weapons if they are above or
    below a certain height. Mobs can shoot PCs from any height.
   Mobs never run out of arrows.
   Mobs can cast through the water/air surface, PCs can't.
   Mobs can pass through PCs and other Mobs at will. PCs cannot.

5.    Netiquette
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


*    Newsgroups are like self-governing communities; there are no "Newsgroup
 Cops." Instead, posters regulate themselves. Below are some simple rules of
 newsgroup etiquette to understand before you venture into a newsgroup.
Think
 of newsgroup etiquette as a set of guidelines that will keep you from
making
 mistakes and make you look and sound like a veteran newsgroup poster.

*    This is a non-binary newsgroup, please do not post binaries.

*    Do not post in HTML

*    Lurk. Read the newsgroup without posting for a few weeks. This is known
 as "lurking," and it will give you the flavor of the newsgroup.

*    Read the FAQ. Find and read the newsgroup's FAQ, or list of Frequently
 Asked Questions and other important and useful information. It can answer
 questions you didn't even know you had, and it's the quickest way to learn
 a newsgroup.

*    Stay on-topic. Know what's on-topic and what's off-limits. Every
 newsgroup is a little different in what it talks about, and how it does the
 talking.

*    DON'T SHOUT. TYPING IN ALL CAPS IS CONSIDERED SHOUTING. It's easier to
 read a mix of upper- and lower-case letters.

*    Never, ever post "MAKE MONEY FAST." It doesn't work, it gets people
 really mad, and no matter what it says, it's probably illegal.

*    Everyone hates commercials. Be very hesitant about posting
 advertisements or commercial messages. This also gets people really mad.

*    Ignore "trolls." Some people get a thrill from posting "flames" (really
 obnoxious messages) just to get a rise out of people. Sad, isn't it?

*    Don't "spam." Spam is posting the same message to dozens, even hundreds
 or thousands of unrelated newsgroups. No matter how important you think
your
 message may be, it's not worth it. Think about it - if everyone posted
about
 every topic, no one would be able to find anything.

*    Be Original. Don't overquote: Copying a long post (more than 20 lines)
 just to add "I agree" or "me too" is considered bad form. Make clear who
and
 what you are replying to.

*    The Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
 Remember, every expert was a newbie once.

*    Don't "Top Post", meaning your reply should be at the bottom of the
 original message.
