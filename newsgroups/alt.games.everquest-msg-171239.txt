It is possible to get a download but all you get from that is the old 
world.  There are plenty of on-line stores to get it from.  You can also 
buy from Station.com Store.  I've bought most of the later expansions 
from them and haven't had any billing problems or any other trouble with 
them.  If you can't afford the whole kitandcaboodle, I'd buy Planes of 
Power, depending where you live, you'll get classic Everquest plus the 
expansion.  You'll also need a credit card or prepaid gamecard to start 
your account, you are promised 30 days free but they know you'll be 
hooked and want to make sure they get paid after the 30 days. They are 
real good about waiting till after the 30th day before billing.

If you can afford it, Everquest Gold is your best bet. That comes with 
all expansions up to and including Planes of Power.

Have fun, and post when you get started.
