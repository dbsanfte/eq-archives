Hey dumbass, you replied to me, and quoted somebody else.

I don't 3 box, nor do I have 3 accounts.

Me personally, I have 4 machines, and I often 4 box.  I can 5 box at a push.
I work fulltime, I have a r/l partner, a social life.

What else should I waste my time on?  Sit and watch TV all day long?  Sit in
a bar all day long?  Gee I didn't realise theres so much I could be doing
with my life!
