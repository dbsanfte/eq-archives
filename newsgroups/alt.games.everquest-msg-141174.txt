My level 51 ranger and my friends 51 wizard make 100 plus plat per day killing
the rygorrs at the rygorr fort in eastern wastes.  this includes the velioius
weapons but not the rygorr armor that falls off the elites.  And about 60% of
the mobs are still blue to us.  
If you've never played there get some instructions.  Nothings worse than a newb
training the whole zone :)
