As far as I can see from this thread, you guys have more money than
you can shake a stick at.

You seem to have a *very* different definition of "broke" than I do.
If someone tells me they're broke, I expect that they have less than 5
Plat to their name, not so much plat that they can blow 15 Plat on a
teleport.

Level 35, and I've got (I think) just over 100 Plat in the bank.  I
definitely don't have enough to waste 15, 20, 30(!) plat on a
teleport.
