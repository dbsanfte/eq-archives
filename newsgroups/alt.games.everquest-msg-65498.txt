Folks-

        I've been playing EQ for just about a month and have (or may of had
a LVL 16 Ranger).  My computer crashed moments prior to installing SoL.
This resulted in the complete reformatting of my computer by the folls at
Best Buy.  My question though is, is my character gone now that I have lost
all my EQ stuff I placed on my computer?
    Next question is can I reload all my previous EQ disk and not loose
anything and just use my password and Login ID again?  After all it is the
same computer and all it just had some issues.
    Thanks in advance for any assistance anyone can render either repost
here or send me a e-mail thanks,again.

Frederick
