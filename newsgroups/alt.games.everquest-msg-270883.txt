You didn't read what he wrote. Consider the 'freezer door' example. Like 
your freezer, the giants aren't releasing humid warm air into a cold 
environment. They are releasing frigid air into a cold environment. The 
humidity being worked on isn't coming out of the giants its the humidity 
in the air around them. (which while admittedly low, is suddenly forced 
to be much lower, and forces what little water is in the air around them 
in gas form to condense to steam.
