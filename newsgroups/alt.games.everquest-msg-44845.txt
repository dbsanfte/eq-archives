Here is what I have always heard...

Fastest in Primary Hand (you want the best damage to delay ratio, so
lowest delay is not the only thing to consider)
Big hitter in Secondary Hand.

The common wisdom being that the more often you attack via your
primary hand the better the chance of dual wield kicking in and
hitting with the off-hand. Since the off-hand relies on the primary
hand attacking you put the slower harder hitting weapon in the
off-hand.

I am not familiar with the stats on the canes verses the batons...
