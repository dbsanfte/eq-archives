I can't answer your question, but I do have one along the same lines.

We're going back to The Hole tonight, and plan on getting off of the upper 
level.  This means jumping down to where we're going to have to evac / port 
out as a group - or, in a pinch, maybe I'll remember that I can cast gate 
this time.

Where is a good place to start fighting down there?  Directions from the 
Golem-guarded bridge would be great.  We're worried more about the initial 
"break-in" after jumping down.  We don't want to start with a huge train, 
it possible.  My suggestion to the group was going to be to just go to the 
edn of the upper level and jump down where it's not such a long drop.
