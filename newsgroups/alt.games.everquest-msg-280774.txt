And yet his numbers line up with every single verifiable source of 
actual numbers.

LMAO. I'm sorry but that was irony at its peak. Whats the point of 
citing sources if the sources are deliberately fudging the numbers? 

Inflation? Lol...

2004.htm

Did your computer cost 25% less this year? Did you cosume energy 
(electriciy, gasoline, etc...) or food last year? According to the 
inflation calculations: you didn't.

Unemployment rate? That's understated too. 

You want numbers that lack credibility read your governmental economic 
publications.


> Nothing like this on his site.

You'll tend to scare away anonymous insiders by putting their faces on 
your website.

The numbers track with the verifiable sources *you* found. Your 
explanation? Coincidence?
