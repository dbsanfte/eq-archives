Apparently there are 150 EU servers and 1m EU players. Using that as a
baseline it means there's about 825 (5.5 x 150) servers worldwide! An
amazing number.

But since NCSoft and Mythic have never been top guns it easier for them
to accept their position. Harder for a company like SOE that's used
to be number one to accept it isn't. Plus Sony itself is used to
being a major player, so I doubt the high up execs will accept them not
being the market leader.

The other thing about EQ2 is how every unique idea SOE has is being
slowly taken out of the game, ie access quests, locked combat,
integrated crafting. It's coming more and more a copy of WoW.

I would actually put NCSoft above Blizzard as an mmorpg publisher. Yes
WoW is mega but NCSoft have Linage I&II, Guild Wars, CoH/CoV and more
coming. They have amassing a very impressive line up. There are also
far more innovating in their games and unlike SOE they seem to have
good new ideas.
