I notice I see quite well in Lake of Ill Omen at night even without
Deadeye running.  I attributed that to it being a newbie zone, and
outdoors with a clear sky... but thats a little silly, since its a newbie

zone for creatures with excellent night vision, while the Tox is
notoriously dark at night.

Anyone willing to address this controversy need only create a
level one erudite and wander into the Tox forest one game
evening.  If you can see your hand in front of your face once
you get away from the torches at the entrance, its improved.
