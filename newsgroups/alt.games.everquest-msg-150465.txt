I dont think this will work. I have also heard that you can slowly
ease up to a mob group, sit, take a step closer, sit, step up, sit,
etc. until one mob aggro's on you, then run back out of aggro range of
the others and fight the one you pulled.  The idea behind this is that
when you sit, you con as lvl 1 and since you do not engage the mob
within aggro range of the others, they never 'feel' the need to add.
It all sounds reasonable, but I have yet to make it work  :)  There
are always exceptions, but I think the only consistent way to fight a
group is with a group.  You find a reliable way to pull one mob from a
group of many, pls let me know....
