Yes, SCM3 should be top priority. After that perhaps level one on MC 
(fairly cheap FT1)? And perhaps SCRM if you like to use HoTs (SCRM will 
make them last 50% longer, SE will do 3k instead of 2k for example). 
Lots of points though, since it has prereq SCR3 I've heard fairly good 
things about Radiant cure but don't know much about it.
