First off, the "grace period" isn't helping anyone. A week worth of
tribute, unless you play CONSTANTLY, is a drop in the bucket.

Second, it was not OBVIOUSLY over-inflated unless you were aware of
certain point values. Not everyone did. I found fine steel, which was
when I got scared, because I'd ALREADY turned in several items like my
War Magus' Arrow Guard which have since seen their value plummet! What
do I do to get back my shield, since I'm going to lose the tribute
points I got for it? Over half of them go away next week, and I'm
still out the shield! I CERTAINLY never would have turned it in if the
point value had been less than half of what it was, but too bad for me
because it should have been OBVIOUS somehow that it wasn't worth
that....
