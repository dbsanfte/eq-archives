Are you behind a firewall, at work, on a school campus?  I've read other
threads with people having the same problems and they had mentioned
something about specific UDP ports being blocked and that certain zones load
over certain UDP ports.  Other than hearing about something like that,
that's about all I know.  I have not had similar problems with my home
setup.
