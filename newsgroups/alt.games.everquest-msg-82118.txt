If you gonna use UK dial up you will always have the 2 hour cut off. If you
are a NTL customer for phone you can use their Dialup which was free but
they will now be charging �12.99 per month, same as Freeserve. BT Anytime is
�2.00/month more expensive and as an ISP they suck big style. Poor
connectivity.

Few others around like supanet.com etc but still all limited to 2 hour
shutoff.
