Hear hear! Although /ooc is often fun, I don't mind that, but it's out of
context - not just out of character - when /shout is range-limited. Removing
/auction from non-city zones would remove the use of that for zonewide
comms.

I've not noticed over-auctionism - but then I switched /auction off about
four weeks ago...

Well, if you don't provide the environment, it doesn't give the incentive.
