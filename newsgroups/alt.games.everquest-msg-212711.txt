I'll wager I've fought more AoE mobs than you and I know one person
who was using the above ring through NToV and Ssra.  Think about it,
when do you NEED the junk buff up?  All the time?  Most of the time?
Most of the time?  No.

Would I use the above item?  Only if I had to, but then again we had
apps who came to us with J-Boots as their only clickie which ain't
much better.

melee.
