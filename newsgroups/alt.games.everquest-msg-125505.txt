I recently formatted over w2k and installed ME for two reasons, for
better sound and because I was having some real compatibility issues
with W2K and the latest Nvidia TNT2 Pro drivers.  My sound worked ok
before, but is much better now (sblive+mp3).....however, I am having
real problems with my ide-cd r/rw burning cd's and some of the apps I
run are now hanging.  Planning on starting over again this weekend,
going back to W2K, ordered a GeForce to get rid of the TNT2 and will
just have to live with a little studder in the music when I'm running.
