Why?  Because the vast number of EQ players are masochists, willingly bending
over to allow SOE to cornhole them time after time after time.

They don't like druids to solo or any class to solo? OK nerf the Druid.  Druid
bends over and assumes the position. Amazing.

Too  easy? Too Hard?  This is a GAME. It is supposed to be entertaining, not
necesarily excessively frustrating.  Many many subscribers simply do not have
the time to wait around an hour or more at odd times  because they happen to
have a life and actual  support themselves with a  gasp  JOB.looking for a
group. They have to solo.
