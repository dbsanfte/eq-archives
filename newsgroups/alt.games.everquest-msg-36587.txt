They were green to your characters, that's why they did'nt move until
you attacked them. My character is only level 8. They are not hard-coded
not to move because (trust me) they chased me all the way to the middle of
the zone and hit me for 127.

So basically they have a zone that has 'trivial-loot-code' that only low
levels can get but the only low-levels that can get there have to be non-kos
to the heretics or have high level spells cast on them. Gee I wonder why
no one adventures there?
