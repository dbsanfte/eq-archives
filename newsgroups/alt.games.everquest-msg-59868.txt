Nope.  Recently took a level 51 character to OT for a while helping level
some 35ish friends.  Guess what was "light blue" (read: exp-giving green).

Exp is totally based on mob level.  From what I can tell, "light blue" mobs
isn't a change at all.  Verant just changed it so that the 1-level-green and
2-level-green mobs that still gave exp now show up as "light blue."  So much
for actually expanding the level range for exp, I'm pretty sure that was
misinformation.
