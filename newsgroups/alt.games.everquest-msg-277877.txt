  It is done. As I write this, Tholuxe Paells is no more. Bert is eating it.
  My friend Kam has made some observations on the result of joining
the Norrathian gods of Lust and Disease...
  The last couple of weeks have demonstrated the fialure of TP. No
one playing, those who do are apathetic. The server had no presence,
no character. And no one in PoK casting KEI when you wanted one.
  At least now if no one is casting Temperance, I can handle it. Celune
has gotten high enough for it. Gunthak and Dulak still had occasional
duoing and grouping opportunities; and solo, level 39 cleric anti-
undead nukes allow one to do a passable impression of a wizard. (To
do a really good one, you'd need snare and a targeted AE nuke.)
  A particularly good duo session on the Stormwave got Cel not only
to 44 but halfway to 45. Being a middle-term partnership, I felt safe
in popping an xp potion dose, which served well. Thereafter, Gunthak
was no olnger an option - all the undead were light blue - and Dulak
still relies on others to be there; I wanted to get some solo work done,
and there are really only two places to go: Lower Guk and the Tower
of Frozen Shadow.
  I try the Tower first, stocking up on cloudy potions and running to
Iceclad. Once there, I have some trouble clicking in to the Tower with
shadow guardians beating on me; I end up haveing to die nearby.
Thus angered, I run all the way back, and camp at the water's edge
on the south end of the Tower island. Time for Adas to clear a path.
  Path clear, I get Celune's corpse, drag it to the water's edge near the
gnolls, and rez and med. Then, since I hope to get some mileage out
of this place, I bind there, have Adas clear the way again, and take
both characters in.
  Adas and Cel play leapfrog up the tower, one clearing the way through
green/light blue mobs and getting keys, the other just picking up the
keys left behind. On the third floor, however, the plan fails; Celune
goes in alone, hoping to get her main work done against the armors
and skeletons. All are dark blue, good. But as I try to cast Banish Undead
on an armor, I find it isn't classed as undead. Gah. Root and run -
more on me, a Shadowbeast and another armor. Root them, run, try
to camp - no good, I can't keep them all rooted long enough. No
choice; gate out to...er...safety...
  Guess who's pounding on me when I arrive.
  /q VERY VERY FAST before I get stuck in a death loop. Even Adas
can't make turtle soup out of Lodi without help. I log for the night,
vowing to try Lower Guk in the morning.
  Next day is Saturday. I log on with Cel, Lodi not in sight. Loot, rez,
rest up, run back to PoK. On arrival, I get a /tell asking for an LDoN.
What the heck, it's guaranteed to last long enough for an xp potion
dose, and if we do BB camp my mana will go farther nuking undead
than healing the team (not that I can skimp on that...) Off to BB I go.
  As luck would have it one of my co-workers is in the group, playing
a bard he recently sacced down to 46 and has just gotten back to 48.
We gather other members, get a slaughter-58  and head to the crypt.
Things go well, but our tank has a nastly habit of popping the bitten
victims; he says he just can't resist. Two follow us, two become
spiders, which are a pain, as they have to be killed but don't count
toward our goal. Then the tank gets REALLY boneheded and decides
to open a trapped box. I get up Cure Poison just in case, but we have
no chance: the box hits us with several waves of 400 non-melee
damage in les than a tick. Instant death for everyone.
  At which point I discover I forgot to change my bind point. I'm back
in Iceclad...
  Nothing for it; I begin the long run back to civilization, hoping to make
it. I nearly get to the bridge when the team that just killed Lodi asks if I
want a lift. As if they need to. Change groups to port to South Ro, take
the magus to BB - later I realize PoK would have been quicker - and
bind. Back to the crypt at last.
  The tank is properly chastened by his mistake; he vows never to do
it again. Even so, our junior necro /tells me he isn't grouping with
THAT guy again. I understand completely, though personally I'd give
him the benefit of the doubt.
  Two mobs have been killed in my absence; only four to go, in six
minutes. Rezzes can wait. I loot and throw myself into nuking targets.
We barely win in time. Alas, a second run is out of the question now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Next up: Adas in the Elemental Planes again. The target this time:
Xegony, the last god standing between Invictvs' current crop and
the Plane of Time.
  It's a LOT of waiting. We gather at the air tower in PoT and all bind
there, often a good idea for fast recovery and TL evacs. The raid is
a big one, 70 people; as a gimp I am among the last in, entering  the
Plane of Air to find us packed like sardines around the zone in. It
is clear why we are so dense: some giant-sized animated armors are
very close. Once all are in we have to buff and arrange groups just so.
An hour after our nominal starting time, we begin fighting our way up.
  At the fourth island, we are in a position to have our necros go up
to Xegony's island, and everyone else TL's out. We go back in
immediately, and then, group by group, "Go forth and die!" The
necros summon corpses up to the island, clerics first, and
we recover our strength there. It takes another hour.
  More glorious waiting as we get our pullers to keep an eye on the
add groups. Three groups, with most of our clerics, will keep Xegony
busy while the pullers try to aggro the add groups as they come to
life and pull them to the main raid force at the north end. It falls apart
immediately: the puller of the first group to come to life can't get aggro,
the Xegony groups are torn up, the main raid can't handle them fast
enough, there's chaos, officers order everyone to camp. I am one of
the few to make it.
  Observing from Rabotev, I wait while everyone is rezzed. Swithcing
back to Adas and rezzed in, I listen as the strategy is modified:
the main raid will split in two, some at the north end, others south;
I am south. We station ourselves in sight of the spiders, and Xegony
is engaged again. The spiders come to life, we aggro them quickly,
they nearly wipe us before north group comes to our rescue.
Xegony still engaged, we rez, rebuff, reset positions, and pour on
the DPS again.
  Xegony at 84%; armors come to life, head north. South groups
run along the edge, behind the rainbow, dangerously close to a
red-con named, and come to help north group. This goes well:
trash are mezzed, named is killed, trash are easily dealt with, few
deaths, and we reset again. We feel we are in the groove now,
we have this, just have to keep up the pressure.
  Xegony at 69%. Another group comes to life, but this time they
bring armors that are not supposed to be with them. South group
goes down fast, north won't have enough firepower to survive
either, raid wipes. We've been at it six hours, it's past midnight,
raid is called off, we'll rez in the graveyard, but we learned much;
next time we'll have it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Sunday, working on Celune again. Leapfrog with Adas in to
Lower Guk, get into the all-undead areas and invis to the bridge,
drop down to the safe corridor, amd start pulling. Celune is
well-armored, she can easily tank three knights, but the yun
ghoul wizards suck; they give me a taste of my own medicine,
nuking for 25% of my hit points. I take one death learning
not to pull one, and stick to knights. With xp potion bonus,
it's a sweet camp; I get all the way to 45 and gate back to PoK
just in time to recieve an MGB KEI. That will make a serious
difference; it may last to level 46, with luck.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rest of the week is spent idly having fun with lower level
alts that can solo easily. Beastlord Grukyn and enchanter Nuneviu
easily ding again, as does Gruggoredil, whom, being the first
character I played on TP, I allow the honor of being the last as well.
Logging off from him, I go to spend more time on Drinal, bringing
up my mage.
  Drinal seems a friendly, lively place since its merger with Tarew Marr.
All kinds of people giving our all kinds of buffs, and doing polite
stuff for free. I can only hope Bert will be so agreeable to
my main stable of characters.
