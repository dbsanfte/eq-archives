What is important to you?  I have a level 51 ranger, level 33 druid, (for
porting), level 29 shaman, (for sow potions), level 24 beastie, and a level 18
cleric, (all on Tholuxe Paells).  None of them are guilded.
I am a serious player - well, I *think* I am.
My ranger is my free spirt, and the most like me..  She checks out the new
zones.  She can track the foe and advise of it's level.   She can sow and invis
when necessary.  She can hide and stay in the shadows to provide invaluable
data to friends.
It is MY opinion that a guild requires commitment.  I just can't DO commitment:
  I don't want to let anyone down.  I don't want to make promises I can't keep.
 I don't want to feel like I *have* to track, port, or rez for a group "on
call".     I don't want to feel like I *HAVE* to bring on my cleric and *work*
on her because my guild needs her.  
I just like to PLAY!   And, I have no  patience.
Being non guilded:  I still have friends and join groups.  I still sow, buff,
port, and rez (0%) people.  I don't have the ability to do the really hard
quests, and I've never been on a raid.  Are those things important to you?  If
they are you need a guild.  
If not?  Play a class / character that solos well :)
Freedom reigns!
