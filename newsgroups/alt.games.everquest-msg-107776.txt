I think bards are social only to the extent that if you can imagine
what a real life bard would be like, they'd be social.  They sings songs
which used to be a way of passing down history and memorizing stories.

In the game, though, they get to talk only when wandering the countryside,
not in any way engaged in battle.  I wish there were a way to auto-twist
songs, freeing the bard to type ocasionally.

During mana pumping time, I usually let chorus of clarity play for a few
ticks on its own so that I can type too.  Slows the pump down a bit, but
I think the mana sponges understand ... mostly they don't even pay attention.
For example, when I had a nice mana twist going in a group recently, I got this
response: "Why does your mana song keep stopping?! grr.", "It's not stopping, 
really, it's a way of giving you more mana per minute."  "oh... hmm".  
So either they don't group with a bard often, or they group with a bard that 
doesn't know how to twist the mana song for maximum effect.
