Hah!  I like that.  You know, I was in a youth group with a leader who 
used to use the word "wench" a lot.  I had no idea people still thought 
it was a *bad* thing until I moved to another province and said it for 
the first time :)

(Of course, by the time I'd left, not only was everybody a 'wench', but 
most - 'nice christian girls', mind you ;) - were happy to claim 
membership in my 'lesbian club'.  What can I say, I'm weird, and it 
catches :D)
