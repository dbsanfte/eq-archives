some items have the exact same name but are different:

Rune of Fulgeration is not a rune used in spell research, it's used in spell
research *practice*  -  two identical halves which are combined, and there
is no way to tell which half is which without holding it and casting
identify (or casting identify on someone who is holding it on thier cursor)

i once wrote to this very newsgroup, proud as a newbie could be, that i had
discovered a bug . .. nope, learned through flames that there were in fact
two runes of fulgeration

and thus, you could find a vendor selling Rune of Fulgeration for 5p and
Rune of Fulgeration for 5kp
