Hey, guys and gals!  Heh...  Anyway, I just recently hit 45 (and am now
halfway to 46), and I thought I'd start on the first portion of the Druid
Epic (Up to the Dark Elf Corruptor, as I have a decent group in mind for
that portion).  So, myself and a partner went to the Burning Wood to talk to
Telin Darkforest - the guy who starts the quest off, to begin with...

I hail him, and he tells me that I must prove myself first?  Now, my
question is, I had thought that the quest NPCs will start talking to you at
level 45.  Was I wrong about this?  Or could it be the fact that he cons
Indifferent to me?  Any advice would be very useful.  Thanks!  :)
