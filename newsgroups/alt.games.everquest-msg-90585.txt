Verant's reply;

Sure thing, we will implement that next patch along with removing the weight
penalty for monks, allowing rangers to wear plate and giving the Knight
class dual wield

Up until they Rangers get Triple attack a Warrior (with equal equipment)
standing toe2toe can hold it's own against all other melee classes except
monks, in fact, except for the Rogue, the warrior should outdamage the
others (from what I remember the melee table goes, Monk, War/Rogue,
Knight/Ranger, Bard) so I see no reason in increasing the damage output, it
is as it should be.
Rogues will outdamage all other melee classes (when the mob is aggro'd else
where) Monks will be not far behind the Rogue (from any angle) then comes
the Warrior and then the Hybrids (who, mana permitting, will prolly be able
to outdamage the warrior thru casting but not thru pure melee) and finally
the Bard, who is a support class and can be as much use, often more so,
without swinging a blow.
