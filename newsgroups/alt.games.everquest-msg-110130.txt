I will speculate there is a minus zero percent chance of that
happening. The one reason why current EQ can't upgrade much is the
character files and how dated they are. They could not even alter the
Xp table, instead they had to use outside division and multiplication
at the point of receiving XP to do away with the hybrid and hell level
penalties. Therefore they certainly won't move such antiquated
characters over to EQ2.

Its a fully new character type, with stats and skills and not the same
classes. Instead you pick priest type, mage type, fighter type,
tradesperson type then you specialize farther at level 6 and more
later.

Its a new EQ, only the world history and feel will be the same. Most
of it will be updated for 2003 mmorpg competition.
