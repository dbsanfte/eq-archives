Yes, that is true, the original 120% full group bonus (divided 6 ways) 
was replaced with a new system where each person gets 1/5th of 180% of 
the mob xp value, yes, I see how that removes the full group bonus, you 
are so very right.

Example:

Mob gives 1000xp, full group kills it.

Old system, 1000x1.2/6 = 200xp per group member.

New system, 1000x1.8/5 = 360xp per group member.

Effective xp bonus for a 6 man group under the new system:

360x6/1000 = 2.16, or 216%.

Is that clear enough?
