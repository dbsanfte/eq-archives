Wrong, I pity those that are introduced, twinked and powerleveled by friends
into the game.
The most fun I ever had in EQ (by far) was when I was a newbie and didn't
know the limits of the world, ran around Queynos hills, into blackburrow,
left corpses everywhere but had _loads_ of fun.
Also, EQ can and should be fun all the way to 50, if you play it with the
right mindset (or don't play at all ...)
