Another cool side effect- since it puts you outside your newbie city, you 
are typically within 30 seconds of a PoK book. My run's about 45 seconds, 
but that's sloshing through Innothule ;)

This is great for LDONs or out-of-the-way adventures- bind outside the 
dungeon without the pain in the butt of having to run backthrough, say, 
LOIO to get back to civilization.
