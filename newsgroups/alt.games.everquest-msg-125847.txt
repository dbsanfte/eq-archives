I have enough of a problem keeping up with Usenet, my guilds message
boards, and our guild alliance message boards, and playing EQ to keep
up with yet ANOTHER set of conversations on EQ.  :-)

I believe I heard it here, and from someone who's info I generally

I don't recall EVERY reading Absor saying anything about, but in the
face of all this evidence that is contradictory to what I knew, I was
forced to check out the Rangers Glade.  Found this:
