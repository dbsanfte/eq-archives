Yes I agree. The whole "having to be logged in and playing" in order
sell is stupid, and ruins any chance of running a successful shop for
most people. Other games let you have offline vendors and I don't see
their economies failing.

The arguments they give don't make sense. You still have to go out and
kill monsters in order to get funds to buy things.

Cheers,
