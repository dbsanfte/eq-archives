My Pally with fishing skill over 100 is having difficulty fishing since
December EQ upgrade.  Did they do something to fishing ability?  Few month back
I was getting to the point where fishing 20 fish was getting easily, loosing
few bate in the process.  Now at the same fishing hole it is taking me three
times as long to get 20 fish and 50 bate!
