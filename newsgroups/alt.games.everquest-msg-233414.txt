As far as I know, the only source of flawless rockhopper hides is the cave
in DSP which i see camped a lot (sometimes by one level 65 guy, sometimes by
a group that just claims everything in sight regardless of what they can
actually handle). I'd really like to get tailoring past 203, which it has
been stuck on, despite several stacks of hides and 255 wis. If i can get it
to 210, it looks like ethereal swatches would get me to 212. Is there
anywhere else to get these hides (or skill ups?)? I'm so bored with fighting
light blue beasites and arguing over who owns what mobs :P

I used to make arctic wyvern stuff but the coldain velium tempers are deadly
dull to make and i can't afford the bazaar prices.

Do people generally level to 65 before taking up tailoring? I'm level 56.
