I've noticed that too and I was wondering why.

I think that it is that EQ and EQ2 are grouping games whereas WoW is
more tailored for the soloing player.  In EQ1 and EQ2 people tend to
solo when they can't find a group and in WoW (I think) people tend to
solo until they encounter something that they need a group to overcome.
 This means that people have not got as much experience in grouping and
so they just do their own thing.  Most of the time they get away with
it and so they aren't taught how to do it better.

I've certainly been in a group in an instanced zone where we gave up
and I fealt that we could have gone a lot further if we'd just
coordinated our efforts better.  The tank kept pulling when I could
have done it - he didn't have a ranged attack and he kept running up to
the mobs to pull and often got adds.  I could use my bow to do the pull
which would reduce the chance of adds.  If we did get adds then I could
control one of them for a while with one of my traps.  I suggested this
but they didn't want to do that in case I got agro and couldn't lose
it.  I have my pet which has a taunt and it rarely fails to keep agro
from me if I keep my damage low so I don't think that would have been a
problem.

In EQ2, I spent too many nights struggling to get groups which is what
turned me to WoW.
