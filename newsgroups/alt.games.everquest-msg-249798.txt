No, it's not.  But that's not the point.

Even if the system operated perfectly, there would still be a HUGE
volume of CS traffic to deal with, because *people* aren't perfect.
Particularly where money is involved.

A guy buys some uber item, it turns out not to be as good as he
thought, so he disputes the charge on his credit card, claiming
that he never bought it in the first place.  "It must have been
a hacker!"

Another guy buys a bunch of stuff and is happy with it all, but
when his credit card bill arrives at the end of the month, he
discovers he's spent too much, so he wants to return it.  (In
general, merchants are required to accept the return of merchandise,
right?  I assume the same would apply here...)

A third guy lets his son play, and the son goes on a buying spree.
The guy gets his credit card bill and goes ballistic, blaming SOE.
