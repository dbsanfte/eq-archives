And how many times have 100% of the EQ servers been down all day? I can 
recall lots of times when I was playing EQ when I couldn't actually play 
because all the servers were down, including backup ones. Blizzard is no 
worse than SOE when it comes to uptime, and actually, typically better, at 
least in my experience. YMMV. *shrug*
