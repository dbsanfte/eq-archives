I had also intended emotional harm.  IMO statements such as "you don't
deserve X becuase you're gay (or black or have curly hair, or have
cancer,etc) are also harmful.

My statements stem from the fact that  I don't see being gay as a behavior,
I see it as part of who this person is.  IMO its no different than being
tall, being thin, having curly hair, wearing braces, liking chocolate,
hating to dance, etc.  A behavior is an action which you either choose to
do, or which your nervous system engaged in by instinct. For example a
behavior you choose to do is calling someone names in a hurtful manner,
assaulting someone, organizing a campaign to pass a law preventing someone
with some characteristic from living in a certain neighborhood.  A behavior
engaged in by instinct would be pulling your hand back from something hot,
or your heart beating, or closing your eyes when you encounter a bright
light -- you get the idea I'm sure.

So what I am in essence saying is that your behavior cannot be of the nature
that you would tape signs to Joe's back saying "I'm gay kick me".  Your
behavior cannot be of the nature that you say, Joe is gay therefore I will
start a campaign to keep him out of my favorite restaurant, or from buying a
home in a certain part of town.

In a certain sense everyone is different.  We are all individuals.  WE need
to accept that people are different -- in all their differences -- and not
single out any particular difference and take actions (i.e. behavior)
against that person due to their differences.

Totally agree.  However, I would also like to know that Joe hasn't told
anyone simply because he doesn't feel like telling anyone.  I would like to
know that Joe hasn't told anyone because of fear concerning the actions
which others would take against him.

I know--- its that whole warm and fuzzy thing again.  Too much time watching
Star Trek and all its utopian ideals while I was growing up.
