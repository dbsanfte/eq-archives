Through all the expansions prior to PoP my necro has been able to find
good spots to fearkite and invite others to join him there when the
mood struck.  Now, he is high enough level that about the only places
left to hunt are PoV or PoS, but fearkiting seems impossible there, at
least in all the spots I have seen.  Anyone have any leads on spots
where fearkiting is feasible  in PoV or PoS?  I would even settle for
root/rot, as long as I don't always HAVE to find a group to hunt in
those zones.
