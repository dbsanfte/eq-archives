I concur, although its possible that this has been changed, up until a couple
months ago it certainly -did- work this way.

For one thing, since many mobs regen health, and some mobs even
heal or Complete heal, it would be silly to base things on what portion
of 100% of the mob's health you did... since a mob may have taken
102%, 110%, 150%, even 200% or 300% its total damage before
finally dying.

A good fix, though, would be to reduce the value of that final shot
down to how many points the mob had left when it landed.

Has this been done?  If so, why hasn't anyone commented on the
change in this newsgroup?
