Thanks, Jeff, just picked it up this evening and was planning on starting on
it as soon as I finished TTT. I continue to be lost here (oh yeah, like
that's a big leap for me ;) ) and wanted to get some background that the
other, main books didn't give. I've read the Hobbit again and the FoTR, and
as I said, am nearly finished with TTT. I just feel like I'm so lost because
I haven't read this stuff in something like 25 or 30 years, and I would
really *really* like to read discussions and know what the heck they're
talking about! :)

Thanks, I will read it as soon as I finish this one (which would be...
tomorrow... oh! no, today! It's 320 in the States :)
