Yes, and A) that sucks, because there are thousands of people playing on 
that server, and 60 or so people win the "race" to wake him first.  Plus 
B) its also one example, against hundreds of other "named" encounters 
that respawn like clockwork and never change.

Imagine if Sleeper's Tomb had two versions, one you would enter if you'd 
never wakened Kerafyrm, and one that you would instead enter if you had. 
  You personally would never see the Sleeper again (and the rest of the 
zone would also be changed as it is now on all the servers where he's 
been awakened), and yet any other character who hasn't yet seen him 
awake will still be able to one day dream that they might waken him, and 
maybe even beat him (without cheating)

Now imagine the same thing for many of the hundreds of other names which 
pop up occaisionally all over Norrath and Luclin.
