    You'll take him soon enough, now that you know what to expect. If you
can get your healing down, he drops pretty easy. I find Rumblecrush to be a
much harder fight because of the difference between a Rampaging mob and a
Flurrying mob.

    Yep, the race to debuff. His Rampage is a pain too - you have to really
watch that rampage tank or you have all sorts of people eating damage,
backing up out of range, and just scrambling to stay alive. So you have two
things to worry about (rampage and debuffing) on engagement rather than just
one (healing on MT) with Doomshade.

    Usually the same guild does both. Whenever we do RC we always make sure
to clear the Dark Masters, whether we've heard the zonewide emote or not.
Emote goes off once per hour or so, so there's a good chance we'd miss it if
we just came in, killed RC, and left.

    I bet all those flurry messages made you crap your pants when you
started seeing them. ;-)

    Whether people still kill Doomshade or skip him seems directly
proportional to what dropped the first time they killed him. Our competition
got the random collection of weapons none of them would use, and doesn't go
there now. They also got the really bad drops off RC (shawl/mask), and so
avoid Umbral like the plague. We, on the other hand, always seem to get a BP
off RC and got the earring off Doomshade the first time (and the Bow the
second time), so we go back if they're up.
