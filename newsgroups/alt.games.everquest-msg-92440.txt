Go find the damage log I posted a lil while back....

Sure wizards may suck in YOUR kind of group, but that isnt the ONLY kind of
group you know.

In case you can't find the log I posted... its something like 20 mobs killed
inside 1minute 10 seconds, with my wizard alone doing 80,000+damage (in
Discos, Sebilis - a high level dungeon)

Tell me what other kind of groups can match that for exp?
