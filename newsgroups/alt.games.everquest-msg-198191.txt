I have always assumed that as Karana definitely has more players on it
as it rises up the scale that it was because the servers are sorted in
descending order (most populated first), but maybe it's due to some
other phenomena.

The only thing I am sure of is that Karana is busiest in what is late
evening in the UK, i.e. 11pm or later  (usually 5-8 hours ahead of the
US)

Typical examples of this are Rathe mountains, which usually has 8-12
players in the uk midday and rises to 20+ players around 10pm (when US
kids come on-line). and Paludal Caverns, which becomes completely
chaotic.

Mrowh 55/54 Beastlord on Karana.

Frostfist (36) Beastlord on Stromm.

Otserp (32) Mage on Venril Sathir.

Wikkan (42) Druid on Karana, Nekk (32) Necromancer, Moorbane (26) Warrior, Zinga (32) Bard, etc....
