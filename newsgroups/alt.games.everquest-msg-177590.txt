Well, that was always an option.  :)  But now you can be more certain
that you're blaming the actual culprit.  Of course, you're the only
one getting the message so it doesn't prevent arguments and etc., but
if you were a pick-up grouper it'd be handy to let you know who might
be best left off your "A" list for future groups.

I only played my Enchanter on Test briefly after this went in, and my
pet was well behaved during that time, but I can say that when I hit
the wrong key and accidentally mezzed a DoT'd mob the mez broke without
the attribution message.
