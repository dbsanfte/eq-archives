   I am glad that we are in agreement on this.  This is getting pretty
silly, in my opinion.

   The other newsgroup must be a much gentler place than a.g.e.  The only
thing I can think of would count as biting would be my "I'll speak to
whomever I please" comment.  Yes, that is bit short, but is is how I feel. 
For what it is worth, my reply would have been the same had anyone said to
me "Please don't talk to so-and-so."

   I feel exactly the same to your replies.  But I am willing to admit that
maybe I've misread your intent.

   Cause you've known me long enough to make that sort of call.  Sorry, but
come on.  We've exchanged maybe 4 or so posts?  Most of them less than 5
lines long?  And you came to this conclusion after I simply told you that I
will speak to whomever I choose to?  Um, ok.  

> But I didn't intend offense, nor was I telling her what to do.

    I have difficulty figuring your true intents from the words you choose
to represent them then.  There, see, it's all my fault.  You win.  Please
enjoy your celebration the manner you find most appropriate.

   A couple of quick notes, though.  Ben, I never "supported" Reg.  In
fact, I was countering his point.  And Bob... I cannot of course speak for
Julie, but I for one to not think that you were doing anything to try to
start a ruckus.  The part I regret most of this silly debate is that you
were made to wonder if anyone at all thought that.  Please don't let this
trifling matter give you a moment's hesitation when you feel to urge to
write up more of your informative posts.
