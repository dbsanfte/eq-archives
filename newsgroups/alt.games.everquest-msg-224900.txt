And in that "window" mobs will ignore a successful feign?

There's only one mob in the game that *ever* ignores a successful feign. 
There are some other random bugs that pop up now and then, usually involving
a mob's hatelist changing dramatically in a short period of time (lots of
people dying, I stand a good chance of getting summoned while feigned after
everybody else dies, for instance).

I believe you were just referring to the fact that FD is not a guaranteed
100% mem wipe for mobs above 32.  If so, you were the very first one in this
thread to refer to that aspect of FD.  :P  Beyond that, you didn't even get
that info right.  :)
