Nope,  looks like  you were first in line and seem to have made some 
major purchases.  Chopping my post to remove the part you should have 
been focusing on demonstrates that fact and leaves me with the image of

tell  you when you should stop doing things cause you are too fucking 
stupid to figure it out on your own.

Now get back in your damned 10% and leave the rest of the game to those 
of us smart enough to avoid you 10 percenters.
