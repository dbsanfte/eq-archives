Not really.  Most racists seem to be severely narrow-minded, which is
not incompatible with the ability to reason, but rather a restriction
on its use.  Indeed, I've had the honor of knowing a number of people
who could reasonably be characterized as slow-witted and yet they were
quite open minded, definitely not racists.  In contrast the most
virulent racists I've encountered have been, as a rule, quite bright.
