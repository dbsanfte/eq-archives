Soloing in LOIO at lvl14? I think that would be a good way to get killed,
unless that zone has changed quite a bit since I last went there?

Well, prior to the advent of eqatlas.com, yea. But since then, it's been
pretty easy to always have a good map at hand and navigate pretty
efficiently. That did require getting comfortable with navigating by /loc
coordinates while in motion. But then even that became somewhat less
important with the addition of the compass (alt-D), the catch being that you
have to work your sense-heading skill up to a decent level for the compass
to work well.

Bottom line is, I just made it a rule way early on that I would never set
foot in a zone without a printed map. Not much trouble to gradually build up
a file of such maps, and so the LoY cartography system isn't really muhc
added value.
