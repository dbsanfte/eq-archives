/agree

The OLD Prima books were often quite useful... 'Rome on 640k a day' (the
guide for Civilisation) was pretty good... but that wasn't written untill
months after Civ came out and was already a big hit.

These days, most guides are written BEFORE the manual, so they can be
published at the same time as the game (or in some cases, months ahead of
the game if the game gets delayed... Sid Meiers' Sim Golf springs to mind)

As a rule of thumb... don't buy a guidebook that's been published within 3
months of a games release... and then, only if it contains information you
will refer to more than a couple of times.
