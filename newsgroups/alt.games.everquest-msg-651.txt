Looks to me like this the list of bizbee's number one fans actually.

Oh, you mean the daily snipes and barbed directed at bizbee?  Looks like
this applies to bizbee also then.  He certainly posts his inflammatory
bullshit regularly and in doing so disrupts the group.

If some of those folks weren't under constant attack (yes, it works both
ways) they would probably have stopped long ago.  bizbee is just as much to
blame for it as any of the folks on your "troll" list.

The funny thing about this statement is that you appear to be colluding with
bizbee in so much of the crap that he spews.  You appear to be an enabler.

And yet you support it with a virtual "high five" on occasion.

You had to give up.

Why should anyone have to toss their sense of common courtesy out the window
in order to read the minor contribution he makes?  Yes, minor.
