Still works like it always did on my Ranger.  I can pull singles from
the dwarf camps in EW no problem.  But then again, I don't think
people always understand how harmony works.  It just reduces aggro
range, it doesn't make mobs not aggro.  You pull a mob too close to
another mob that been Harmonized(tm), it will aggro.  Took me a bit to
learn how to use it with my druid, many, many moons ago.
