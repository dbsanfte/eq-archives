A while back, I was quite happy to complete this quest.  It was quite
an accomplishment because the respawn time on Dillan Starsine was
something like 7 hours.

In a recent gander through HPH, I noticed he was up.  So I got on the
horn and helped a +wis caster friend get it.  Later that night, I
noticed he was right back up.  So I helped another friend.  Even later
that evening, he was right back up.  I could not get the exact spawn
time down as I wasn't really aware this would happen, but he certainly
respawned in much less than 7 hours.

Did I miss something recently?  Was his respawn time changed?  This is
an excellent item (and quest) for wis finger wigglers.
