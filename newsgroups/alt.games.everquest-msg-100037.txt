Levels over 60 ignored outside the planes of power.

Eeasy. Manastone for your stats.

I love VI. I am a VIAK (nyaaaah!). I think EQ rocks.

But I do know from long experience VI take the easiest, cheapest, most likely
to fuck everything up solution to everything.

Rebalance everything? Provide a story reason for it? Or just cap your effective
level outside the planes?

I know which one I'd expect.
