Dunno, I'm sort of on haitus at the moment, haven't played EQ in over a
week now, other than logging in long enough to get a body  out of Fear
and just this morning to test invis vs charm (invis wins).

I was seriously considering going back to my bard, which I gave up on
due to RSI, but oddly the most recent patch doesn't seem to have
included the Melody thing they are playing with on patch.

I could go back to my mage and get him to 70, or my cleric, with the
same plan.

Or I have a 52 shaman I abandoned, not because I felt I'd topped out,
but because a friend wanted to start new characters on Firiona Vie.
I've heard bad things about high end shaman these days, though, and I'm
not sure I need to repeat my Berserker experience so soon.

I "topped out" my warrior at about 30, but he's been deleted.  Have an
enchanter at about there too, not as "topped out" by any means, but I'm
seeing a lot of unhappiness reported in the enchanter front these days.

I have a baby ranger I made to support my berserker with, he's 25 or
so... but another relatively unwanted class that can solo only
painfully?  I'm not so sure I want to continue with that line of approach.

I also have a 34 druid who again was created soley as a support
character, but I don't really see anything out there that makes me eager
to delve back into him.

Classes I haven't played past 20 or so:
Necromancer
Paladin
Beastlord
Shadowknight
Monk
Rogue
Wizard

Paladin strikes me as similar to berserker but with more "top end" 
utility; I'd miss the sheer raw power though.

Shadowknight, at least at low levels, just isn't my cup of tea, I've 
tried it a few times but never got past 11 or so.  Dunno why, and 
perhaps trying it again I'd feel differently.

Beastlord is interesting, a jack of all trades sort of class, I only 
played one, into the low 20s, shortly after luclin release.  Back then 
there wasn't much to look forward to on the class, and I went back to 
playing my cleric.  Perhaps I'd like it more now... and maybe with more 
modern gear and spells I could get up out of the doldrums I seemed to 
hit in the mid 20s.

Monk, well, it seems a poor solo choice, and not much wanted in groups; 
thats not to say its not a good class, but it seems a poor choice for me 
since I don't have a built in support group.

Rogue, well, take what I said about monks and double it in every 
direction.  Really bad solo, really not wanted in groups, excellent 
class, but really piss poor if you don't have guildmates or a regular 
group to play with.  The "really not wanted in groups" part is of course 
stupid, but it seems to be true anyway.

Necromancer is an interesting thought, I literally quit my last one in 
the low 20s because he was too easy to play, too powerful.  I've played 
powerful characters more now, though, and could probably cope better 
with the seeming excess.

Leaving Wizard.  My very first EQ character was a wizard.  Played him to 
level 4, never looked back.  Poor soloer till what, 29, 34?  Not wanted 
in groups ever.   Again, without friends willing to put up with a class 
that's percieved as substandard, I don't think so.

Oddly, I might just quit, I've been busy IRL and haven't logged into EQ 
On any character in about two weeks, and looking forward I might be 
offline for 6 months starting as soon as Thanksgiving.

Hell, if it wasn't for AGE I'd probably have quit already!
