Hmm, yeah.  Time to bust the bo staff back out of the bank (now that my 1hb 
and h2h skills are respectable again) and see what that baby does post-
damage-cap.

I've been taking a break from solo xp-grinding to see how quickly I can 
level up a warrior on Stromm -- without outside twinking or uber-buffing.  
Getting to 2 was a snap for a Vah Shir; the citizenship quest took 11 
minutes.  Then off to Qeynos to kill and loot everything in sight.  
Finished off the afternoon at level 6, having saved up a little over 30 
plat, and bought some banded pieces at the Bazaar.  Not bad.
