Yep. After having posed the original question and reading the initial
responses, I realized I was looking at it primarily from a warrior's
perspective. The casters will have a far easier time of it than any
class except the monks (unless they are brainless ubertwink monks who
started out with fighting batons at level one and never learned hand to
hand.) Of all of them, I rather think that the oft maligned wizards
might have it easiest of all. All they really *need* to do is get enough
cash to get all new +INT items to get their 200 INT back. With their
spells, overpowering green mobs that drop a lot of plat would be trivial
and they could be jewelrey shopping in no time. The pet classes would
also do quite well. (I mean the *real* pet classes, not you shaman and
enchanter types... he he).
