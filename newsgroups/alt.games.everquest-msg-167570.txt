It's up to you, but I can tell you that 58 levels later I am
*completely* kicking myself in the ass for going agnostic on mine. Had I
a chance to do it over again I'd have gone with Sol Ro all the way.
Missing out on a lot of good shit now that wasn't in the game back then.
When I started my main characters, religion was really a roleplaying
thing only, with no noticable benefits. Now, of course, there is player
made stuff with insane stats that's only available to "x" and "y" diety
for most all classes and races.

There's a huge thread raging on Graffes about whether or not Sony should
put in some obscenely hard quest to allow people a one time change of
religion. I sure wish they would. I'd probably do it, even if it took a
month and several full blown guild raids.
