Basically you could solo up to 65. It just gets harder and longer to kill
anything.

As for more powerfull.. Depends :).

Shamans are notorious for soloing the most powerful things, and druids and
wizards exp a lot faster then necro's via quadkiting. Necro is a nice
in-between imo.

Groups/raids is a lot different again.
