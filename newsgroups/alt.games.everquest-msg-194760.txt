So, either I'm an arsehole or a softie (IT support does that to you
{:-), but in cases like this, I would ask "which smithing vendor?".
Describe what the looked like?, Male/Female/Race?, etc with the approach
of educating the person that they need to be specific in a petition if
they want a fast answer.

On the otherhand, alt+enter, alt+tab(browser, load
http://www.eqtraders.com ->trade supplies by zone) supplies a lot of
untold information.

Ohh, I just remembered, I've probably posted something similar about
Z???? in West Karana. He was spending his time gauzing whistfully at the
mountains and wouldn't trade. SO I petitioned just on his name and zone
for a fix.

In that case, Allakazham.


Actually I http://www.google.com.au for "item everquest" whenever I find
or hear something I don't know and that almost always produces good
results.

So I'm probably giddy, i.e. changing my thoughts on this matter. Meaning
if you have to do an online tight time limited examination in closed
book, then I think the questions are just an enormous wonkle.

If you just submit the questionaire within a day, then okay, that fine.
At the worst, you would have to run your chr out and see what is there.
