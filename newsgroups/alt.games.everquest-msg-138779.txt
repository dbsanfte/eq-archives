Hi guys :)

This is my first post though I have been *lurking* for quite some time.
Forgive me if this is a bad, lame, already discussed, newb, *insert other
criticism here* etc question but.....

With the advent of the Bazaar feature I now have about 15k to spend on my
main character, a level 47 Halfling Druid. I also have the means to get
quite a bit more cash in the future to gradually improve her equipment.

Basically I wanna know what I should be aiming for regarding equipment for
her. Any advice for any slot is appreciated but I want it to be stuff I can
buy so NO DROP is outta the question at this point.

I won't bother to go into ALL of what she already has in the way of
armour/equip because I really would like an opinion on what I should be
aiming at for her without mentioning her current equipment. However I WILL
say (because these are probably the best items to have in these particular
slots at this point) that she has both of the POTC earrings, GEBs, a nice +5
range item and ES arms (yeah I know, I know hehe) that she doesn't want to
give up at this point.

Thanks for your help! :)

Schylaar
