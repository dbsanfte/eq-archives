Your faulty assumption, here, is that the 'too far away' messages have 
anything whatsoever to do with swinging or the delay cycle.  Those, and 
the 'can't see target' messages pop out 2-3 times a second, regardless of 
whether you have a moss-covered twig or a weighted axe equipped.  And of 
course, the instant you move into proper position, (assuming at least one 
whole delay cycle passed since you last swung) you swing.  You just got a 
good solid double attack there. :)
