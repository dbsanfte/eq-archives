Well they are and then again they are not. They con the same but, their magic
risists have gone through the roof. BTW I now has a WIS 156. At 34 when these
same guys were dropping like flies my WIS was an anemic 134.

Also it seems I was a bit premature  in my comment re the Lake Rathe Cyclops. 5
for 5 yesterday before I had to log.  THye all averaged one resist each which
had me meleeing them Oom to put them down.
