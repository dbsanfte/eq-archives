All this stuff about if the person is a moron because their
characters were deleted by a kid is moot.

The answer is, yes.
Verant will undelete your character EVEN if you 
PURPOSEFULLY deleted it. The characters are never
really deleted but are on the backup server. You will get it
back in the same state you deleted it in. So if you sold all his 
stuff and deleted him, don't expect the one they give you back
to have stuff (that would give people the idea to scam that way)

Verant will undelete it because they want your, well not $9.89
anymore, $12.95 per month. A friend of mine just deleted because
he was "quitting" then EQ pulled him back! All he said was "I thought
I was quitting forever but I want back" 

"kk thnx undeleted money plz LA~"
