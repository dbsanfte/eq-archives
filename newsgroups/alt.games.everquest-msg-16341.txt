Yes... I saw that note on eqatlas, but decided to risk it anyway.  I 
triggered the trap, and the doors flew open, but my invis remained intact 
and I was not attacked.  I can't remember whether I was invis or invis vs. 
undead at the time, but I could easily see this rumor being started by 
soeone who had the wrong one up...  I could also see which one you need 
varying with time of day.
