At soom point between kindly and warmly when you con something it will
say "a guard considers you", with no adverb after it.  Maybe its at
transition from warmly to ally, I got it in Erudin and Skyshrine right
before becoming Ally.  Skipped it in Thurgaine, went from indiff to
ally from one kael arena raid, missed it completly.
