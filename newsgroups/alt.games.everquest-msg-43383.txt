Error 1017 is basically your computer ip not being recognised as far as i
can tell. Error 1018 is when ya have a char stil lactive. I have fixed this
error a numebr of times by doing the following

1) Connect to the internet
2) Click start and then command and type winipcfg and then enter
3) the popup box gives options to release all, click this, now click renew
all
4) after a time (can be a longish wait) it will say cannot resolve dhcp
something or other
5) no connect to EQ

Has worked for me in past and a few friends.

If this fails, remove hardware from control panel and remove your network
card. Reboot machine to reninstall the card. If this fails make sure your
properties on your tcp/ip does not have a static ip enter but reads get ip
auto

try those

let me know if it does or doesnt work
