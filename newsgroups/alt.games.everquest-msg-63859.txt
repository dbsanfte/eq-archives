I have a celeron 500 processor, 512mb ram, voodoo3 3000 16mb card, sblive
sound, and a win98 os. I installed dx8.1 and used the new dx8 dll on test
yesterday morning. *Everything* ran extremely well, no graphics bugs noticed,
and *very* little lag (far less than I had been seeing day to day on the
regular servers), so I have my fingers crossed that it will all run okay when
the servers come back up. I bought a Geforce2 64mb card; but there appear to be
irq conflicts when I try to install it and since I'd just as soon not spend the
money to upgrade video at the moment anyway (need to buy xmas presents and all
that instead), I'm going to leave the voodoo in place and hope it still works
tonight so I can return the Geforce. Hubby is out hacking and slashing his way
through the crowds at Software Inc this morning trying to get a copy for us. .
