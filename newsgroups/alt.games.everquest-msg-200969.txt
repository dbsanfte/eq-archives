Start getting used to CH cast time now. Youll want to get good enough to
have it fire off on you target between 30% - 20% health on main tank. Timing
is everything. Pay attention to how many mobs are hitting your target. More
than one mob will usually cause health to drop much faster requiring you to
cast alot earlier. Don't take alot of chances at first. It's easy to get
greedy with CH at your tanks expense. use your judgment. At higher levels
you'll need to be good at timing CH. Also you will be grouped with more than
one healr type usually so MAKE HOTKEYS FOR YOUR HEALS is critical. So when
you cast it displays a message like "Complete Healing
%Target................" So enjoy your cleric. IMO they are the most
rewarding class in the game.
