I've waited.  I've gone right in.  And going right in is better.  If you haven't
tried it, you just don't know what you are missing.  Its not the big bad mobs that
are fun.  Its the little stuff.  What mobs aggro, what don't?  Whats stunnable, whats
not?  Hows the exp here?  How about there?  Is this a safe spot?  What are the
faction hits?

Noone knows.  Noone in your group, noone in your guild, noone on the server.  So its
not a strategic exercise, its exploration and tactics made on the fly.  I love
strategy, don't get me wrong.... but this is different, and its a treat not to be
missed.

Because that one day is... never again.  That "several large scale upgrades" is... a
week away.  And a week away.  And a week away.

You'd be crazy to forgo once in a lifetime to get once a week.  And its not once a
week anyway, its tomorrow.  And the next day, and the next.  Because they are
patching the game at least that often.

Further, go after anything big in a patch environment?  Again, you'd have to be mad.
Get your force together, start working in, sweat blood and bullets and lost exp on
the pullers and poof, patch.  Even if you kill mob and loot it, odds are you get a
rollback right over that crucial twenty minutes.  It makes no sense at all to invest
time or energy on the hope that a mob that just popped due to a patch won't be
rendered useless by the very next emergency patch.

I suppose I'm an anarchist at heart.

I vote with my feet.  I want to be in PoP, I'm there.  Guild doesn't see it that way,
well they can either suffer, or they can boot my ass out.

I wouldn't be arguing about it in guild chat though.  I might bring it up initially
in guild chat, as the OP did, but not because I'd think it would cause an arguement,
rather, because it wouldnt' occur to me that any sane person would see it any
differently.

Go kill your mob with the people who don't have PoP yet.  I wish you all the best.
But I just plunked down $23 hard earned dollars for a piece of candy, and I'm going
to eat it before it gets stale!

Now if you want to call yourselves a raiding guild, then blow off your common
ordinary "been popping for a year now" mob and come raid PoJustice, PoDisease,
PoInnovation!  Thats a raid, not another exercise in Pharming.   Or by "raid guild"
did you really mean "pharmacist union?"
