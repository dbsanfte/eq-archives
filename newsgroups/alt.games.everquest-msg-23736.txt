I apologize in advance if my ignorance offends anyone, but I have a
question. My cable company recently upgraded their internet service, so that
I have a new mail server and news server as well as new ISP. I am accessing
the web, mail, and ng just fine, but I am not seeing my posts, even 2 days
later. In fact, unless someone responds to this, I am sure it will not show
up in my ng reader (which is OE5. Other than getting a different software
package, does anyone have any suggestions. As far as I know, none of my
settings have been changed, just new accounts set up to reflect the new
servers.

Thanks,

Lefty
