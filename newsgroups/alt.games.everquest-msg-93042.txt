Err, what is that about tradeskillers getting their cap increased?
For most tradeskills you could get to 250 before luclin:

Baking:
Can get over 200 on both dragon steaks and pixie powdered cinnesticks, 
no changes with luclin.

Brewing:
Minotaur Hero's Brew take you to 248 skill, no changes with luclin.

Fishing: Can fish to 200 or 250, dont know the cap, but no changes with 
luclin.

Fletching:
The one you complain about.  Can get to 235 on several Darkwood bows, so 
only increase are the last 15 points from luclin. Complain agan when you 
reach 235 skill.
15 point in skill cap change with luclin.

Jewelcraft:
No new recipes in Luclin, and can get to 250 on other recipes. No 
changes with luclin.

Pottery:
Can get to somewhere over 208 with Imbued Idols. No changes with luclin.

Smithing:
Can get to 242 on Fine Plate armor cloaks without luclin.
Can get to 250 with shadow scream steel armor from luclin. Again, reach 
242 smithing and complain again.
8 point skill cap change with luclin.

Tailoring:
Most velious armor are not trivial at 250 skill. The Reinforced Acrylia 
are trivial at 245, so its 5 points from the skill cap. In addition, 
acrylia is a lot harder to get than the materials for velious armor (i 
can farm greens for acrylia, drop rate around 1 in 30, or i can kill 
wyverns for XP and pelts, and spiders in velks for xp and velium).
So changed are none to trivial level, added a alternate way to get to 
245 skill, but materials hard to get, and i personally still prefer to 
do velious tailoring instead, due to rarity of acrylia.

Tinkering:
Heres the real change with luclin, tinkerers can now relatively easy get 
to 215 skill, without dishing out the 700 (or is it 900) pp a try for 
rebreathers. And to get over 215 skill they still have to make clockwork 
armor by doing velious tinkering.
No skill changed, but a cheap alternate way to level the skill.


So 2 tradeskills total got a cap increase, and 2 more got an alternate 
way of skilling up (one where the materials are so hard to get that its 
easier to use the old ways).


Am a tailor myself, i dont skill up on the luclin tailoring, only make 
it to equip my twink monk and a friends twink monk.

The smiths i kinda doubt theres that many 242 smiths, but those few 
there are, im sure they like the change. but its not an everyday 
occurrence that someone complain about smithing skill cap.

For fletchers, i can see an idea, since its fully 15 point extra with 
luclin. So the few 235 fletchers probably love luclin.

For tinkerers, theyre theyre the ones really profitting from this 
upgrade. They get a CHEAP (around 30pp and 1 drop a try) way to get to 
215 skill, compared to either rebreathers (700 or 900pp a try) or 
clockwork armor (no idea on price, but include FP armor and rare drops, 
so a lot more expensive). Know a few happy tinkerers after this upgrade.


If you tinker, you NEED the upgrade to luclin. If you tailor, dont 
bother for that. If you are a smith, are those 8 points worth it?
If you fletch, get it when you reach 235 skill.
