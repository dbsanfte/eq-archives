It used to be worse: several of the required parts did not drop at all
for some of them.  I vaguely recall hearing they fixed that.

Head over to Thurgadin and hang out in back of the church--I think you'll
enjoy it.  (Assuming they haven't changed it...it's been a long time since
I was there).

The way to check something like that is to go invis, target the NPC you
want to check (only getting as close as is necessary, since invis has a
random duration for your class (some classes, at high level, get fixed
length invis spells)), and then get out of aggro range, keeping the NPC
targetted.  When you are at a safe spot, then you can drop invis and
check to see what they think of you.
