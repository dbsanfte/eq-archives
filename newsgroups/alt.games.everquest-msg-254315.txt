His point was that whoever made this char went through at least:
Legolas
Legolaas
Legolass
Legolaass
Legolaaas
Legolasss

before -finally- finding the available:
Legolaaass

Not to mention probably a few tries at:

Leggolas
Legollas
Leggollas
Leggolaas
...
etc

Or just give other players the ability to delete any 'legolas' on sight, 
with a "/kill-another-legolas" command. :)
