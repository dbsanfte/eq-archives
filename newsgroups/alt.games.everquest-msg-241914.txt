I could see maybe something thrown in. However, I think it's good enough 
that we suddenly have a steady stream of xp mobs there for the taking, 
though they occasionally are a bit of a nuisance. ;)

However, what kind of loot might you expect at a lower level? The stuff 
dropping off the commanders and such is ok, not great, but still of the 
quality that normally requires an encounter a good deal tougher than a 
single skeleton for a lower level to obtain.
