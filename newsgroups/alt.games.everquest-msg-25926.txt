I think this is where most of us will differ with you.  It
does hurt to throw coins at newbies, when they are begging
for it.  I am all for helping people UNSOLICITED but when
you have the same person shouting, sending you tells, etc
over and over again for money and items it gets damn
annoying.  Newbies (Most of which I suspect are Lazies not
true newbies, people to lazy to bother twinking their new
character themselves), seem to expect a hand out any more. 
I don't mind helping someone, but people expect you to give
them all your money etc.  They expect you to buff them while
your busy fighting something.  The begging is out of control
and it has fuckall to do with the /Beg button.
