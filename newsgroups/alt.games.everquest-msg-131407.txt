It was mentioned to me this morning that the mob who you talk to for the
PoTC quest and to exchange the one earring for the other is gone on
Test. Is this true? Bullshit? Anomaly on one server? 

Heard anything about it? I have one gift left to get, and if they hose
this quest before I finish it, I'm going to be royally cheesed off.
