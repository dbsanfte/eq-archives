The only thing I can think of is that you did have one of those nasty 
DoTs on, and for some reason the server wasn't updating your buff window 
and health bar properly, or else your buff window was pushed partially 
off the screen and would hide that particular effect, and perhaps you 
had someone else targetted and didn't notice your health dropping down.

I would only worry if it starts happening on a regular basis. :)
