Hmmmm....*rub chin*....my story may be defined as derivitive (damn), but I
don't believe Amulett's artwork can be.  First off, when folks refer to
"fan art/fiction", traditionally the idea refers to stories, via movie,
comic, or novel.  Everquest is a game, though, not a story. FAn art for
Star Trek might show Captain Picard, whilst fan art for Everquest shows
Venerable Cherryblossom Smilesalot.  Does SOE have a copyright on
Cherryblossom Smilesalot?  I don't believe so, though the bit in their
EULA makes me wonder what they believe.

There is something in the legal code I've been reading online too that
says something to the effect that games are not copyright protected in the
same way as written works, but, grrr, it doesn't make enough sense for me
to use it as my platform for argument. So scratch that. But if anyone is
curious where this is coming from, see
http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl108.html

Look at her pictures.  You see elves.  Are elves copyrightable? No. (See
section 102 of US copyright law, paragraph B, for that.  Also see section
107 of US copyright law.) You see armor types that are very similar to
armor styles in EQ, but can SOE copyright their armor styles....? Eh, I'm
unsure, but I don't believe so.  I would argue that Amulett's artwork is
not derivitive, but rather _inspired_ by Everquest.  I would further argue
that she is indeed protected by copyright.

I think I see your point about "fan art" not being copyrightable to the
fan artist, but I begin to suspect that not all "fan art" can be defined
as derivitive, especially if it is of original characters.  This is
roleplaying fandom.  You might not be able to trademark your roleplaying
characters, but to say you can't copyright original stories or art based
on a roleplaying world...that can't be right. 

Do you see the distinction I'm trying to explain?  I suspect I'm
explaining myself poorly, but I'm supposed to be working, not posting, so
I'll have to let it go where it is.

(On a different subject, love your sig Empty.)
