I talked to one woman that swithced from a female character to a male 
one because about 3 to 4 times a day she would be asked if she was truly 
a female and when she said yes the guy would start asking her what she 
looked liked,how old she was, If she had any nude photos that she could 
send him Basicly she was tired of being hit on all the time and just 
wanted to play the game
