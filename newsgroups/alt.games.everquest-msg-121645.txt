  Fifteen minutes ago, my 53 Druid just died to a 925 point Judgement 
from a light blue elder shardwurm, which was a total surprise.  My
group was in the process of getting the wurm out of the way to go in
to the chrystallines to get a friend some spell drops.

  I like the idea of mobs selecting better, stronger spells and being
smarter about casting.  That's entirely reasonable and good for the
game.

  I don't like the idea that they can cheat and cast spells way above
their level.  An elder shardwurm is a 40-42 level mob, how in the
world should they be able to cast a level 56 spell?  I realize the
designers can do anything  they want; and mobs cheat in other ways
too, but now we can't even begin to plan our encounters until we know
what each mob might be able to cast  regardless of level.  For all we
know, a level 11 derv caster in N Ro can now pop us with Ice Comet (an
extreme example, for illustration only, I hope).  It's a whole new
game with the casters.  And I tend to agree, even if I had not died in
this particular encounter, that maybe they need to make some further
adjustments to this.
