It is a newbie quest, and my guess is that you are either being killed in
Kithicor or
West Karana; maybe even HHP itself.  These quests, though designed for
newbies,
really aren't.  If you have to cross Kithicor, don't cross it at night.
Most of the
mobs can see invis and hit incredibly hard.  During daylight hours 9am to
9pm
(game time) Kith is a newbie zone.  I would look for some other newbie
quests
that don't have you crossing really dangerous zones.

Best of Luck,

Danthurn Mastersmithe,
Prexian Warrior
