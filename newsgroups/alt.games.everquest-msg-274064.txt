That specific case is just annoying--at least on the corpse recovery you now
know where  Hill Giant spawn point is so you can maybe avoid it.  Where the
EQ1 death penalty really sucked was when you died because something you were
trying to do turned out to be too hard.  Let's see...doing X was too hard,
so you punishment for failure is to get to try X again but this time without
your best equipment?

In a game where so much of one's power comes from equipment, the EQ1 death
penalty was somewhere between cruel and stupid.
