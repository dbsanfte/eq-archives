Well, remember... in terms of the OP your'e talking about a sub twenty
level character who will, most likely, just be getting into a low level,
friends type guild. Such things might be considered a lot more important
there. Unlike the more typical verbal sparring he'll find thirty levels
later.

e.g.

"Holy Fuck! I think you just burned a HOLE in my screen! You know,
Tyrinia, a simple, 'No, I don't want to cyber with you.' would have
sufficed."
