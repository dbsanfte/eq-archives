Context? Perhaps you needed hammering at that time. In *this* 
particular matter he is being an ass in his response to a simple 
question that only requires a simple neutral response.

And the only dick I kiss happens to be my husbands. You are now 
being an ass. You feel the need to be obscene? Fine. Words only 
have the power that the listener [reader] grants them. Kissing 
dick *must* mean Kalshazaar's nickname for his penis is a 
colloquial form of Richard?
