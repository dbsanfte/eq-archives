The Geerlok devices are about the only thing I have really heard people 
talk about from Luclin.  I have one of each, now, thanks to a Guildie, but 
haven't "put them to the test".  I'm pretty happy about their existance 
since I will be working on Tinkering at some point, and they do seem quite 
cheap to attempt.

I haven't heard one word about Jewelry additions, although I have looted a 
lot of odd gems.
