No, no, I didn't say "am I a twink?" I said "how twinked am I"

And it wasn't a question on my part, so much as an answer.  I'm running
this shaman as  an experiment of sorts, and reporting my results here
to the newsgroup for those who might be interested.

I twinked him out because I've found I enjoy playing that way, but also
because this lets me "skip ahead" once I get thru experimenting at one
level, I can level up relatively rapidly to the next plateau.   I've
done 1 to 50 more than once, 1 to 30 lots of times, and I don't
particularly feel the need to level slowly.

But thats just apologies for twinking, the point is, there was some
question as to how relevant my reports might be to other shaman who
might not be so twinky.  So I thought I'd detail the twinkage and see
where we stand.

Another thought thats occured to me is that I might not really be
twinked by effect  (as opposed to by action- since gear was given to me
by a higher level main, thats always going to be twinkage by that
definition); at some point this gear is going to go from "no way to do
that at your level" to "gee shouldn't you upgrade that stuff, most
people your level have better"   Funny thing about twinking is you are
less inclined to upgrade gear than a "straight" character would be!  Oh
and disenclined to loot when there are needier people in your group...
