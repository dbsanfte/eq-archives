So they thought the 16 zones would have filled a CD and when they didn't,
they threw in a couple games to take up the left-over space?  If that's so,
then that makes sense.  Still wish they threw in a few more dungeons, mobs,
quests, secret rooms, etc. but understand it if they were working under a
deadline and didn't have the spare personnel that would have required.  I
really like the game and love to find secret rooms and marvel at the eye
candy locations.

Again, I wish I had worded it differently and didn't react in kind to some
of the replies.  Calmly worded, this thread would have been different and I
wouldn't been labeled a troll.  Hopefully, lesson learned.

And thanks for the nice calm reply.
