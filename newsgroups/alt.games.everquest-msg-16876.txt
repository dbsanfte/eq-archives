Oh yea, I remember her name all right.. but I don't feel it's right to
post it here.  She'll get a bad enough reputation on Fennin Ro.  Oh,
incidentally my boyfriend has a caster that ported her a few days ago
LOIO to G'Fay.... he remembered her because she bitched at having to
GO TO HIM for a port since she was paying "good plat for the trip".  I
think she's making herself well known all on her own....
