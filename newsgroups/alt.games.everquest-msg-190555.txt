Or an Improved Healing 3 item if you're mainly a healer...

Focus effects that cut casting times also have a small effect if you don't
have a horse, since you can sit down more quickly and so med more.

Basic point, though, is that in the long run it's mana conservation (in
its various forms), flowing thought, and mana regen that stop you from
going OOM. The size of your mana pool matters less in the long haul (but
is still important where bursts of casting are needed.)
