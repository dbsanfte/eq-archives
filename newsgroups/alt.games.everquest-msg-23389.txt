I'm beginning to see this guy's attitude problem. Being a foreigner I may
have missed some subtle indications of this fact. Sorry about that. Still.
some of the replies were really low and not deserved - at least not to begin

The credits for my language skills, well I have to pass them on to my
girlfriend, who is proofreading my contributions.
