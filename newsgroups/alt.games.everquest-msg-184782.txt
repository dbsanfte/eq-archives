Sony doesn't pay for bandwidth by the megabit. They have figured out a 
theoretical sustained maximum (excluding usage spikes) and they lease 
the necessary lines to provide that. They pay through the nose, of 
course (have you seen the lease prices for T1 or T3 connections?), but 
randomly kicking people out of the Bazaar when they feel like it would 
save Sony zero dollars in bandwidth, and cost them quite a few in 
customer support issues.

As far as Sony's servers are concerned, whether a player connects to 
their local ISP over modem or over broadband it's probably fairly 
transparent. All they would know is the datarate setting of the client, 
and how many packets to spit out according to that.
