Yep, I bet it is.  But it could be done.   More to the point, I doubt anyone
who doesn't have POP and only got into the game in the last few months has a
character worth transferring for anything but sentimental reasons.  On the
other hand, that discarded account has got access to the characters that
were on it before, and despite the OP reporting that they were deleted
before the account was cancelled, I've heard many people report that they
had no trouble getting SOE to restore deleted characters.  Get the
characters restored and then strip them for gear, and you can twink
yourself!

If thats of interest, of course.  Honestly I'd plug for doing it honestly,
keeping the new account, getting POP expansion and playing it straight.  I
just have an irrestistable impluse to play devil's advocate and point out
that there -are- alternatives.
