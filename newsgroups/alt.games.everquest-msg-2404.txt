Trolls have great starting stats before you even add any points.  I brought
my STR to 125 and my STA to 125, although you can add the points anywhere
you like and it will make little difference.  A great quest to do is given
by Basher Ranjor.  You'll need to bring him 2 froglok tad fleshes and 1
froglok meat for a Rusty Two-Handed Battle Axe (great weapon!) as a reward.
I was using this weapon to slap Minotaur Slavers around starting at level 9
and 10.  Having said that, Grobb and Oggok are lacking in the quest
department.
