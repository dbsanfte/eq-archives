I think I saw someone claim that it goes like this:

0. The dispell spell has a certain dispell count.  E.g., the lowest level
dispells have a count of 1.  The next higher has a count of 2.  Then 4, and

1. Start at the top.

2. Make a saving throw to see if the spell will be dispelled or not.  I
haven't heard any claims as to what this save is against (in particular,
whether or not anything you can do influences it).

3. If the save fails, the spell is dispelled.  Otherwise, it is not.  In
either case, this uses up one dispell count.

4. If the dispell count isn't zero, go to the next spell location, and go
back to step 2.

So, if you get lucky on the saves, a 4 count dispell could skip the first
three spells you have, and take the fourth.  If you get unlucky, it will
take the first four spells.

This was offered as the explanation for why sometimes dispells seem to skip
a few spells.

Note that even if there are some dispells that pick totally at random,
having instant click buffs will help.  If your KEI is 1 among 5, it will
have a better chance than if it is 1 of 2, for example.
