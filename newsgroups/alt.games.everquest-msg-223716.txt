Rob's a girl's name where you come from?

Owner of 2501 Netstalker Points awarded by Corwin of Amber, mainly
because Atma's just too damn attractive to get away from.

Gave 7499 Netstalker Points to Cypher because there's no such thing as
a good day on AGFF without JT bashing!

"Final Fantasy Tactics is what a preschooler thinks war is like. The
 combat somehow manages to be even less realistic and entertaining
 than in previous Final Fantasy games. The characters are all
 one-dimensional archetypes in a plot as gripping as the latest
 Peanuts Comic in a setting as fascinating and believable as if it was
 conceived by Scientific Creationists. The game is ploddingly dull,
 the graphics are so childish that if someone sees you playing it you
 should probably feel ashamed, and the movie 'Extreme Ops' has got
 nothing on the ridiculously serious storyline."
