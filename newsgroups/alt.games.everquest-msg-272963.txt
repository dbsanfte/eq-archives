Ok, I have a machine that, while not state of the art, should be fine for 
EQ2.

AMD Sempron 2700+ CPU
ABIT NF7S2 Motherboard
Kingston 1 Gigabyte DDR2700
WinXP Corporate w/ Serv Pack 2
Nvidia Geforce 6800 OC
DirectX 9.0c
Maxtor SATA 120GB HD (EQ2 Is installed here)
Western Digital 40 GB HD (Windows installed here)

I have played several other games (WoW, EQ1, THUG2, Halflife 2, etc...) on 
this machine w/ zero hic-ups, rock solid stable, but for some reason EQ2 is 
crashing left and right (think 5-10 times per night).

I'm thinking of taking the 40 GB drive out and using only the maxtor on my 
system...don't know why, just seemed like a good idea.

The error I get states that eqclient.ini experienced a problem and needs to 
shut down.  If anyone has some tips, let me know please.
