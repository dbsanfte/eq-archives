So your theory is the dev's finger on the pulse should be observing 
'people quit en masse' and then scramble to figure out what the problem 
is and how to fix it. (Some might say add to that "too late".)

should be in the 'last resort' when we missed something big time 
category, not the 'lets plan to do it this way' category.
