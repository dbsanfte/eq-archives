Jboots vs IRS3:
Jboots are a little faster
Jboots arnt with you when your on a cr
Jboots give you a "buf" which can "shield" other buffs from dispel. (insta
cast too)
Jboots take up an inventory slot
IRS3 is basically free since you need 6 AA points to get to arche, and there
isnt much useful to spend it on.

I was going to wait till level 51 and train up IRS3 with my necro, but a
friend of mine (who is making a profession of camping AC/mq'ing) offered me
the MQ for 5k. Seemed good to me.
