Really? I'm beta testing it and I'm committed to helping make the game good,
but I won't be moving over when it goes live.  It just doesn't look or feel
like EQ to me.  It's fun but it doesn't hold my attention like EQ does.  I'm
glad you found it a game that can take EQ's place.  I still haven't found
one.
