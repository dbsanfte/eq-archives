Hmm, well then it seems to me there's even less room to protest; I can't 
afk the bard on melody, because he's going to hang.

I'm better off getting a programmable keypad and doing the auto myself 
if what I want is an AFK bard; this one will still miss notes but he'll 
just keep going.

But this will make operating a bard under normal conditions a matter of 
setting up hotkeys with several different melodies, and swapping them in 
and out as needed, plus monitoring the song window so you hit one of 
those keys if you miss a note.  Hopefully your normal button pressing 
comes down to one every 20 seconds or so, or about where everyone else's 
is, instead of two every three seconds if you don't juggle.

I might go back to bard, if it looked like I could do so without a 
repeat of the RSI my wrists were starting to suffer.  The ability to 
actually chat with people while playing would also be nice, although to 
be honest many other classes can't really do that either.
