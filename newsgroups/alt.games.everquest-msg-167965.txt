And your complaint here is what?  You expect to be able to pursue a
quest for gear that's useful at your level and actually get to play
the fucking game while you're at it?  Get off!  EQ is about mindless
timesinks, and you can bet that if they screw up and put in a quest
where the target class can actually get xp killing the mobs required
(as with the Ghoulbane quest) there'll shortly be a mile-long line of
dr00ds fucking one another in the ass in their hurry to turn it into
yet another waste of your time (as with the Ghoulbane quest).
