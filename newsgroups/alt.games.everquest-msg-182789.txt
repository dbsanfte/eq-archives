It may not be intentional.  One time I found a great price on a
particular item, hunted down the trader by right clicking their name
as usual, but ended up at a vacant spot.  Fortunately the trader was
online at the time and I assumed she moved a bit because she suddenly
appeared in that vacant spot.  Same thing happened again, but this
time I was the trader and a person was telling me she couldn't find me
even though she was standing right in front me.  I waved at her, that
didn't help, finally I moved around a bit and suddenly she saw me.
