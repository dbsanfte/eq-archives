  This is actually an old ranger issue.

  I don't really see how "Bind Affinity" is an "outdoorsy" spell.  I always
thought of it more as a spiritual/religious spell and would sooner give it
to paladins than rangers.  But as others have noted, only the intelligence
casters and healers learn bind, not the melees and hybrids.  Right or wrong,
that's the way it's going to be and that's the way it's going to stay.

  I don't really see the purpose in restricting WHERE melee classes can be
bound though.  If a druid can bind in Lake Rathetear, why not a paladin?
Doesn't make any sense to me, it just takes one more convenience away from
the melees and gives it to the casters.  Though on Firiona Vie, they've
solved this little "imbalance"... by making it so caster classes can only
bind themselves where melee classes can traditionally be bound.  It's fair,
but it's less pleasant for all.  So far it doesn't seem to have had Verant's
intended effect of making towns "meeting places" where you go to buy, sell,
and find groupmates for adventuring parties.

  I think what would help in this regard, and give a little bit more
convenience to melees, would be to put NPCs in the city who will cast Bind
Affinity on you for a price.  This is an old issue too, one of the first
discussions I ever heard on alt.games.everquest, but I still think it is a
good idea, especially on low population servers with weird rulesets like
Firiona Vie.  I've spent hours at a time trying to find a bind before, to no
avail.  It's less fun than waiting on the boat.  I've had a character stuck
in Freeport for four play sessions (of good length) doing nothing because I
haven't been able to find a bind.  That's a problem.

  I think 30 is the right place for SoW for rangers.  Look at the other
spells rangers get at 30 compared to when druids get them.  SoW druids get
at 14.  Stinging Swarm druids get at 14.  Strength of Earth at 9.  Cancel
Magic at 19.  Barbcoat at 19.  It makes sense where it is and be thankful
you get it at all. :)
