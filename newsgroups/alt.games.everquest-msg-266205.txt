Oh well, hope to see you online then. I'll go for blackburrow. I know we'll
never get a server in our region. Although considering asia should provide a
huge potential base for players especially as china develops, I would have
thought there would be advantages. At least if the australasians are
congregating somewhere else, i won't have much to lose by scrapping my
character early on.

It's when you are 5 years in that the time zone thing becomes a problem, and
i loathe paying for a character to be 'transferred' especially considering
item loss.
