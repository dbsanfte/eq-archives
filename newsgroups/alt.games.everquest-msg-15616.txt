i wear a  coldain insignia  ring  and  silver jacinth myself.  i dont wear
the  ac/hp rings because at the higher levels that hp buff  basically is
only equivalent to maybe one half hit  from a monster.    the only ring i
really swap in is a diamond ring for  resist in place  of the ac ring when
fighting things  that have bad mojo like the aoe mobs in tov.

if i was  like  level 20, i might  be  wearing the  hp ring, cuz that that
level its more  benefitial.
