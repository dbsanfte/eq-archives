Well, I finally made it to Luclin last night.  Patching was not fun. 
It took about 3 hours to get all the files.  Getting the files
consisted of starting the patcher, hoping that it would connect, then
if it did connect praying the connection would last long enough to
download a file or two before the connection was lost.  Once the
connection was lost it was time to "End Task" the patcher and repeat
the process.

Most of the character models looked pretty good IMHO.  Surprisingly,
the new iksar model didn't look as good as I thought it did in the
screenshot Verant released before the release.  Something about there
legs just didn't look right to me.  I think most of  the models looked
a lot better once they had armor, or robes on.  The dark elves still
look the best with armor on to me.  Also, the bottom of the caster
robes flowing in the wind looked nice.

The face customization feature worked pretty well.  Depending on your
race you can customize your face, beard, hair, hair color, beard
color, and facial tattoo if you're a barbarian.  I'm not sure the
facial picking feature is quite finished yet though.  After picking my
new face and clicking the accept button I was able to go back and
change it again.  Also, if you use an illusion and customize the face
for the race of the illusion it screws up the face you picked for your
real face.

Anyway, I found the Nexus guy at the wizard spire, got my shard, and
waited for the port.  Once up to Luclin I explored the Bazaar and
Shadow Haven.  The Bazaar had lots of bankers, a PvP arena, the horse
stables, and some miscellaneous merchants.  Once I finished exploring
the Bazaar I headed over to Shadow Haven.  My barbarian rogue was
apprehensive or dubious to everyone in this zone.  I searched high and
low for port spells for a druid friend of mine, but could not find
them.  After stumbling around for a while and getting lost I went out
to www.eqatlas.com and printed out the map for the zone.  A rogue
trainer is listed on the map, but the only NPC I could find at the
location wasn't a trainer *shrug*.

The graphics performance was a little disappointing at 1024 x 768. 
I'm running a 1.2Ghz Athlon, 512MB RAM, and a 64MB Geforce 3.  The
quality of the graphics were fine, but it was choppy when I made a
quick turn to the left or right.  I had the same problem with old EQ
graphics before I upgraded to a faster video card.  I'm going to try
switching to 800 x 600 this evening.  I'd buy a faster video card with
more RAM, but I don't really know of any.  I heard NVIDIA was suppose
to come out with a new card the first quarter of next year.  I hope
they come out with a 128MB version.
