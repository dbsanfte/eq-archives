Yes, I'm very relieved. However, my current care was, after all, listed
as one of the "supported" ones. (Not that means squat, obviously.) You,
on the other hand, may not fare as well with that VooDoo. I understand
the VooDoo owners have had no end of trouble. Search out all the tips
here and on the developer boards before doing it. I understand some of
the updated drivers work, some don't, and some are experimental made by
ex employees of the company.
