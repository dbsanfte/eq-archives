Generally for the type of player you would seem to be (impatient for
results). Go away and beat up some hill giants, and leave the fast
tradeskill money to those who have persavered, rather than making 200 vials
and selling them at 2pp profit after failures, and ruining the economy

Pottery: 199
Brewing: 200 +5%
success rate: 98.23% (according to my log analyzer)
I know I've bought the components for over 200 vials so far and made more
than 190. Sold them all in bazaar for prices ranging from 60pp(30pp profit)
to 150pp (I stuck em up as there were none... had 10, sold in 30 seconds to
4 different people).
