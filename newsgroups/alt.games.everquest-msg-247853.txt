When dualboxing on the same machine, I would go for a melee and a caster 
support. Necro/rogue is a good deal, but fear kiting (or any kiting for 
that matter) will be problematic while you are juggling windows.

I think a shaman would be a good guy to have with an SK or Monk. With a 
warrior I would either go with Cleric or Druid- a shaman with any melee 
basically either helps mitigate damage (slow) or increase DPS(haste). Since 
the warrior is a low DPS and high HP/AC class, I think you will find that 
Thorns and regen will outweigh the slows... 

Personally, If I had to make a duo tomorrow I think I would probably go 
with a beastlord and a mage. The beastlord pulls with slow, then sics pet 
and meds. Then you flip to the mage, sic pet, and toss a few nukes. If 
Fluffy gets low on HP, flip back to the beastlord.
