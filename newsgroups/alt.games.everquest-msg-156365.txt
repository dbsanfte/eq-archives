Hmm, that is something to consider.  My complaint about Manaburn has always
been that it gave wizards the power to do something no other class could do
(ie, could six paladins take down a dragon, include enough well placed AA
points to match the wizard's expense for manaburn).  Now, if any well
considered group of six can do the same, then it doesn't put wizards so far
out of line with the rest of the classes....
