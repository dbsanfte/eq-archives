We had a special changing of the guard over here, they played the star spangled
banner and a silence was observed. It was very moving.
I think the picture of the muslim girl lghting the candles is one everybody
should see.
In the papers today were also pictures of New Yorkers cheering on the police
and fire services, holding placards with things like "Thank you NY's heroes"
its heartwarming to see something so fantastic emerge from something so
repulsive.
