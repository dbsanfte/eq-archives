This is my experience too - banishment not only didn't help
us - I wasted a massive chunk of mana for no effect.  Also -
when do you banish?  Do you leave a rock up and banish with
a few seconds left in the timer for a regular mob?  How do
you convince the rest of the group to depend on you banishing
a mob so they can finish the other one with straight melee
and save nuke mana for later?  If the banish resists (very
often from my and other mage's experience) you just failed.
If you banish a mob, then the group finishes a half dead mob
in another 10 seconds - you just wasted 15+ seconds of melee
output.  I just never quite saw how it was more than a throw
of the dice.

I bought the spell specifically for the trials - imagine my 
dissappointment :/

OTOH - I'd take Cel at 61 over almost any 61 wizard I grouped
with in those trials - her AA's put her right there for midterm,
kill it now type damage.
