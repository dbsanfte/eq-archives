My twink monk on the my second account died at around lvl 20.  I took him
with my main (54 Shaman) to Warslik Woods, to the big gobbie fort and buffed
the crap out of him and started killing the goblins.  All the normal goblins
were darkblue but Grachnist the Destroyer was deep red.  This was fine since
my shaman's pet made lunch out of him but what got me was when I ran across
the bridge to pull a few more mobs...to my surprise there was 3...yes 3
Grachnist's waiting for me there. By the time I figured out that there was
three I only had one bub of HP left, FD failed and I couldn't get the
keyboard and mouse for the other account in time to safe his poor ass.  :)
