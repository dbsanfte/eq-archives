Those rates are gauranteed within reason. They were very supportive when 
I first signed up and observed that I was getting the 1mbps up no 
problem, but was only getting 3.5mbps down.

Naturally they are only gauranteeing any level of performance to their 
own gateways, and can't gaurantee you anything beyond that.

And the service mentioned 5mbps down/ 1 up, is quite new even here.

The price is comparable to the 60.00 figure you quote. Its hard to say 
exactly becuase internet pricing is somewhat dependant on your CATV 
bundle.

My point wasn't to suggest that its like this everywhere (yet), but 
really just to highlight that the cable service is not nearly as limited 
and 'carved' in stone as some might think. Its -all- about the 
infrastructure.

There is no such thing as a legitimate 'cable vs dsl debate' when it 
comes to selecting the best service for oneself. Its far more honest to 
stick with can really do is ISP vs ISP and even then it has to be on a 
localized basis... sometimes right down to your own building.

I routinely hosted 12 people in Rogue Spear without any significant 
issues. And RS is particularly sensitive to lag issues. Both in terms of 
not-so-hot coding, and then the nature of play itself (with precision 
single shot kills being the norm).

16+ person servers of Counter Strike were common too, myself and several 
friends routinely hosted lag free games with that many people.

And this was on cable, a couple years ago, long before the new 
'extreme' service.
