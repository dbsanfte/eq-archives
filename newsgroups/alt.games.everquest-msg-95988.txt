If that reading comprehension was directed at me, could you clue me in as to
why?  I did reread the original post, didn't see anything about raid
situations or such mentioned in it the second time either.  He asked why
people would have a gem mapped to a hotkey, I could have sworn that I
answered that in part, and added more information as well.

Click on it?  If I have it hotkeyed, it's because I am going to use a key to
hit it, much faster than draggin my mouse pointer over there under bad lag
conditions, or even no lag conditions.  I don't hotkey the gems personally,
becuase I can hit ALT-#, just as fast as hitting #.

In a raid situation I rarely use the mouse, as with lag, it moves too slow
to be useful anyway.  I do not spam everyone with information regarding who
I am casting my meager heal on in a raid situation, but then, that was not
the original question, was it?

I certainly am not going to dispute what you or others may do with your
hotkey slots.  Personally, I don't have a hotkey bank for buffing or such, I
just do it, buffing is not something that generally happens under pressure.
I hotkey things I do frequently so I can do them faster and easier.

Did that myself with my boots that cast sow, until I got better boots
anyway.
