I must say, after reading all the posts on this particular subject, half of
the responses are from ASSHOLES!  Nothing like a little encouragement or
help, and I thought thats what these newsgroups are for.

FYI, if anyone is ever on Maelin Starpyre and is a newbie or whatever and
has a question, please feel free to send me a tell.  I'm only a 39 and have
only been playing for a few months, but I will try to help someone if I can
at all.  I won't spend hours of time assisting, but I will do what I can.  I
know that when I was new and didn't have anyone at home that I could ask
what to do, I would ask for help from other players, and 99% of the time,
got it.  I am very grateful and believe what goes around, comes around.  If
someone is an ass to me, don't expect my help in the future, and that goes
for all my chars.

Faceless, as much of a pain as it may seem, hit Allakhazam or Caster's Realm
(among other sites available) for assistance.  If you are really interested
in the game, checking these sites out can give you ALOT of information, more
than you may ever be able to use!  I wish you luck with this game.  I had
never played any kind of role playing games except 10 minutes of Baldur's
Gate (yeah, yeah, no flames please), and I thought it was pretty stupid.  I
am now an addict to EQ.

Also, it could be that your character is not "right" for you.  I've never
had a warrior or a true melee-type character.  Shaman gets to do both melee
and cast, but I really don't like the melee crap.  I like casting, and have
stuck with those type of chars.  Try some others before you bag it.

Sorry if I got off the track, but these posts pissed me off and I had to
vent.
