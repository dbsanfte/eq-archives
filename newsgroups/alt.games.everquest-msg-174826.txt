There are people in the group who are also on Povar - I've seen them
confess. :-) So one of them may volunteer to give you a hand.

Generally you get a month of gametime when creating an account - it can't
be used to extend an account.

The Gold pack includes codes for (original+Kunark), Velious and Luclin. If
you want to retain your original account, you'll have to use the
(original+Kunark) code to expand it (so you don't get a free "additional"
month I'm afraid, even with an "old world only" account). The PoP available
in Australia is similar to the Kunark code in the Gold pack in that it
"includes" the original EQ, and the code may be used either to add PoP
to an existing account or to create a new account.

... Just make sure you use the codes to register new expansions rather
than create a new account.
