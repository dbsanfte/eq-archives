Why?... how is someone to find a pickup group?  I group with some of
the same people, off and on, but I am generaly a pickup group
member... I like the chaos, the new tactics, the helping somone who is
new to the game,.....  Now I dont like some of the asses or the
incapable of learning something new individuals.... but that is when I
can decide to leave the group if it becomes an issue...

So, how should someone in my shoes go about finding a group?  and not
look like a noob?  ehehehh
