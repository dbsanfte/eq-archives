Ive tried just about all of them (altho a few that have just popped up
recently - noteably Shadowbane - I havent). Nothing can touch EQ's
content - well - its had 4+ years to build it. Each game tho does have
something to offer, a different spin on things, but I always end up
going back to EQ. DAOC had some interesting aspects (RvR intruiged me
- but I left before I could really get  into that), but got bored of
it quickly. Anarchy Online has alot of cool features, and i still play
it from time to time. Earth & Beyond bored me out of my skull. UO was
my first real MMORPG, but the PKing drove me nuts (Pre trammel).
AC/AC2 I could never get into (Ac2 seemed so half baked and unfinished
at release). I know im leaving out a few - but if i cant recall them,
they must have sucked.
