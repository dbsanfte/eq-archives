You might see a small improvement adding 256 mb. I saw a small change in
general smoothness when I upgraded my machine from 512 mb to 1 gb. Though I
didn't think it was worth it just for EQ...

(I needed the ram for video editing applications)

It did make multitasking under EQ much snappier having a gig. Back and forth
between Al's and EQ is much nicer.
Also note you don't want to do this if you have a 98 machine, 98 doesn't
handle more than 512 gracefully (basically what you have to do is tell it
not to address more than 512mb of ram with a registry edit.)

WinMe effectivly caps at 1 gb iirc
We have a customer running 2k with 4GB, so I don't think there's a problem
there, or in XP.
