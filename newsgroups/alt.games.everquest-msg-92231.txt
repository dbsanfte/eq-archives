I got a Bracelet of Beetlekind from a quest and amongst other things it has
9 Strength Charges and it says "Triggered."  What does this mean?  How do I
use it?  How do I recharge it?  And most of all I have not found a Web site
that answers these kinds of questions.  Heck, the sites I've seen just tell
you what you already know - if you have the item in your possession.  A good
site referance and the answers to one or more of the above questions, would
be greatly appriciated!!!
