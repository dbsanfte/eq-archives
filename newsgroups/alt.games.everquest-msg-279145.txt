I saw someone linking a potion which heals for 1400 hps,he said cost
is 40p.
Are we playing Everquest or Warcraft?

A major change like PoK books or adding long lasting buffs like Kei or
Virtue,and none of these did the game any good.
I wonder what we get next,Ressurection and Kei NPCs?

What about stealing some more from Warcraft? - a "nice" feature
I found there was getting xp(indirect) while *OFF*line.
Maybe the dev team can have a look at UO too,there you can buy
premade developed characters for real money.

Instead of adding crap like the potions,what about fixing old bugs
like the map background is not changeable anymore,this annoys me
day for day.

So its still the same old song what we get,trivialize the game more
and more by adding features no one ever asked for and let old bugs
unfixed.
