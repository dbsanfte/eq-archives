I do not know if this point has been addressed, so I will continue with my
thoughts on paying for Everquest information via a website.

Not very long ago Verant cracked down on the selling of items on eBay and
other auction houses. In thier eyes those selling were violating Verant's
Intellectual Property rights.

In essence this is exactly what the sites are doing when they charge for
admittance. Even though the maps and information on these sites are compiled
or created by players, it is still in violation of Verant's Copyright. These
webmasters state that the monthly charge is to offset the costs of
maintaining the site, and many have stated that its a "Full Time Job." I
don't know very many people who will do a full time job for NO monetary
gain. There are many people willing to pay for the information distributed
by the sites, and as a former webmaster myself I can assure you that at
$3.95 per month they will make more than it takes to maintain the site.

It is in the fact that these sites will MAKE money from thier subscriptions
that will cause them the greatest problem. Most game designers and
distributors could care less if you create a fan site for the game. When you
start making money is when the problems will begin.

Personally, I do not see this lasting. I know someone in the employ of
Verant who has stated that there have been literally hundreds of complaints
about sites charging for EQ information. He has further stated that action
will soon be taken by Verant on the matter.

If/when this will happen I cannot say. Just wanted to pass on what I have
heard to the group.
