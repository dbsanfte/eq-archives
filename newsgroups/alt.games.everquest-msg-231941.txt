I'm not saying they don't need HP. God knows, I look for HP gear all the
time for my Necro and Shaman.  But... to give up Int/Wis at low levels for
Sta is a mistake.  HPs for the casters come from their gear more than their
initial 20 points applied to sta (what's that, 60 HP at level 65?).  At low
levels, unless twinked, Int or Wis gear is not that easy to get and you need
those stats to help raise combat and trade skills, and add to your mana pool
(20 Int/Wis is about 20 mana per 10 levels).  Those extra 60 HPs will not
help all that much when you get aggro at level 65, much less the extra 20 or
so HPs at level 25.

It all depends on if he's twinking heavily and also what your philosophy is.
