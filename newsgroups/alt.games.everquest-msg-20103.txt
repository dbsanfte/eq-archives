Well I have to say my experience has been totally the opposite to the
one experienced by Knightsend.  So many people have been kind and taken
the time to help me and show me places to hunt and given me gifts.

I was born in Felwithe and chose to study the arts of wizardry, I spent
much of my time fighting at the city gates and then moved to the driud
circle at about level 3.  At level 5 I started fighting on Orc hill with
groups. I learnt very early to stick to the paths or insight of them and
at least get an understanding of Loc.  Sense Heading is also very useful
and can be practiced while medding or resting.

My first trip to Orc Hill got me slain within seconds, as I was
retriving my corpse when a kind high level Cleric approached me.  She
asked me If she could inspect me.  Then she said her friend made
jewellery and may have some items that I could use.  I thanked her
kindly and we parted.  Shortly after her friend approached me,
introduced herself and gave me 2 STA +2 earings and 1 STR +2 ring.  I
was overjoyed and couldn't thank her enough - I still wear them now,
although I will soon have to replace them with +INT items.

I am a level 15 now and because of my experiences with others I take the
time to help people.  I give away bind, help people find there corpses,
drag corpses to safe locations, help people when they request assistance
in battle and try to be a good group member and actually care about the
others in my group.

I suppose what I'm saying is stick with it Knightsend, the majority of
other people I have met are good kindly folk. You will learn the
language quickly and even if you are not role playing try to remain in
character - It makes the game more fun and people respond better.

I hope I haven't bored you all too much,

Adren'
