The fastest skill-ups come from Dark Blues, your a better fighter then they
are and can get more successful hits on them.  Light Blue and White are
about equal.  Its easier to hit LB, so it isn't considered to show that much
more skill so you don't get credit for the skill, and Whites are harder to
hit, so you don't get many successful hits and can't get credit for them.
Yellows and Reds are very difficult to hit and with no successful hits,
there are no credits for skill.

Which shows you why Power Leveling can be a problem.  You get lots and lots
of XP for killing Yellows and Reds during PL'ing but with little improvement
of your skills if you have Super Twink weapons because even though you do
lots of damage you don't get many hits.  And its the successful hits that
add to your skill-ups.
