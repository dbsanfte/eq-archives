He wants to be able to keep what he is wearing a secret.

Not sure why, really, its not as though any of the items in the
game are "my aunt sarah's undergarments' or anything.

But there you have it; while he has the option of not being
notified when someone is staring at his dainties, he instead
wants to cover up the dainties entirely.

Strikes me as silly, when a large number of the items in the
game have display graphics, perhaps in his perfect world
none of them would be visible either.  Heck, currently you
can see our races, if not our classes, perhaps everyone should
use the naked wood elf female graphic for everything.

Oh, and no spell effect graphics or weapon swinign graphics
that might give us away.

Wait, I have an idea, how about pure text based gaming.

In fact, that's still too much info, how about we drop the
whole multiplayer angle completely, and give each player
his own server.

Hmm, passerbye's might see the game on his screen.  One
of those cloth covers they used to use on those old time
cameras ought to do it.  And earphones, mustent forget that,
or the sound might leak out.

Definately don't want anyone sharing this MMRPG with me.
