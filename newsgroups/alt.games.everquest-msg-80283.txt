I mean, what the fuck are you posting this inane drivel on a writing
group for?

So, let me get this straight.  Someone had the good sense to try to whack a
bunch of pirhanas who were scheduled to shortly be released into the
melting pot to feed on victims and the legal system, and the Major
Intellects of the chess club think that was a BAD idea?  What planet are
you guys from?

Yo, Palmer!  You been brainwashing the chess geeks again?  I told you
before, you've just gotta stop it, man.  Really.  The poor little fuckers
are practically defenseless.  It just isn't fair.
