    Carprin, and the bugger is almost always up and in the way of
necromancers trying to charm pets. Once, while medding and watching over a
fight, someone trained his original form (the weak version) to zone. He
doubled me for 1221 damage per hit, and I ran ASAP to zone. That's the weak
version. I would have died on the first attack if it had been the strong
version.
