Since i bought and installed omens, i have noticed graphical distortion
whilst logging in, and when i actually get logged in, my system shuts down
completely POW like i turned off the power switch.

I tried tech support but they said "sorry, no support today, maybe tomorrow,
thank you and come again". I re-patched with the complete file check thingy,
ran dxdiag and watched it pass all the tests, and having existed my feeble
tech support skills, am now stumped as to whether it's because oow is buggy,
or just putting an excesive power load on my powerpack or sumfink (i opened
up and looked at it but can't see the wattage anywhere, but it's always
worked with eq dual boxing before, which i would have thought implied
hardware is fine?)

I went into chat and there was a guy with an ati card with the same problem
so i'm hoping it'll turn out to be everquest. I tried asking about it but
the gm's shut down the chat fast, saying that discussing technical issues in
the chat room was not appropriate. (why?)

Does anyone else get this problem? Is there some thing i can do to test
whether my hardware is failing beyond what dxdiag throws at it? i looked at
the bios and the temperature was fine. If the problem persists i could try
buying another powerpack or video card, but i'm on a limited income due to
health reasons and it could mean a month or so without everquest. :P
