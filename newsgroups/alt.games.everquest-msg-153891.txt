I'm not asking you to use your imagination Dark Tyger, VI never defined
"Zero Risk" like you did. They state "powerful creatures", not "RAID CLASS
MOBS".

If we use VI definition (not urs :), then a 44 wizard could go to CB and own
the TR without much thought. These creatures are what i would call "powerful
creatures", as they have slain many PCs many a time. Does that mean we
should nerf all of the lvl 44 wizard nukes so they only deal 5 dmg incase he
decides to go to CB and own the TR?
Say if he brings a wizard friend, shall we limit the 5dmg nukes to only 1
per minute?
Wizards have the most worst DPS of all the offensive classes, why nerf them
more?

I quit playing my wizard 2 years ago, when manaburn came i started playing
him again only to see VI designers remove a feature they have. Wizards on
the whole are a broken class that aint worth the time playing without MB.
Playing a nuke-happy cleric would even be better.
