You gotta think like a lawyer to see the purpose of the access.  Only reason
for 'discovery' of the records would be as evidence in a future suit against
Sony/VI.  Ain't no way Sony or VI are gonna give up those records willingly.
Their lawyers knew right away asking for the records was just a ploy to get
evidence handed to them.

I sympathise with the mother, she's probably having a rough time of it right
now, but she can't get her child back by suing every Tom, Dick, and Jane.
