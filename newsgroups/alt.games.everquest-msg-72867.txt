Ok, I finally completed the 3rd warrior quest and got the buckler and
instructions to go see some armsman whose name I cannot recall right now.  I
found him upstairs in the smithy near the palace.  Gave him the buckler as
instructed, he gave it back along with a bag and said something like "take this
bag and I will help you with your next lesson."  However, that was all.  No
information on what the next lesson is and no "go see so-and-so" message.
Anyone have any idea what I am to do next?  The bag has a combine button when it
is opened, so I am guessing I need to collect some ingredients to combine.
