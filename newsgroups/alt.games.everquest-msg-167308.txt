Dragon Kill Points. You are awarded points on an objective basis for
raid attendance, that is agreed beforehand and works the same way
for everyone in the guild. Some pay a point per hour, others for
turning up on time, others for successful kills, but the key is the
criteria are known and decided in advance and apply to everyone
equally.

Items are then 'bought' with points. Some systems have fixed prices
whereby the person with the highest current total gets it if multiple
people want, others allow bidding, some have a minimum price and 
bidding, and so on. 

The idea is it defuses any accusation of favouritism and placates those
classes who feel they'll never get any toys because it always goes
 to the warriors/clerics/favoured-uber-class-of-themoment, by giving
everyone the same ability to earn their loot in an objective, explained
and understood system.
