You missed the pea traveling under the walnuts.  I'll slow down
a little.

1) Life cannot have come about by chance, its too unlikely
2) Life must have been created
3) Creation means a Creator

Given the above, substitute Creator for Life

1a) The Creator cannot have come about by chance, its too unlikely
2a) The Creator must have been created
3a) Creation means a Creator's Creator

OR
1c) The creator came about with no creator
2c) Unimaginably complex things can nonetheless exist with no creator

Oops, now we have concluded that we don't need a creator
to create things no matter how complex they are.

We have the existance of Life as a given, Occam's Razor demands
we use the simplest solution that fits all known facts, so logic
suggests we drop the whole "Creator" story until given some other
proof of his existance.

Note that this does not disprove the existance of a Creator, merely
demolishes one suggested proof for his existance.

Could be.  Prove or disprove.

Perhaps Life occured randomly.  Prove or disprove.

To date I have seen no proof of either hypothesis... nor have
I seen either disproved.

Dogma = arguement from authority, one of the classic
logical fallacies.

Fictional entities are also not subject to the laws of time
and space, and the world of literature is full of examples;
isn't it much easier to assume YVHV is merely another
of that set?  A Creator seems to assume facts not in
evidence, while "a story some guys came up with to
help keep the masses pacified" sure has plenty of company.

Discussion must be limited here to the syllogism in question.  To
prove god's existance via the "life is too complex" arguement
means His existance is demanded... within the syllogism.  Of
course GOD could easily exist without this proof, but thats not
what we are talking about.  I'm merely deconstructing one
possible proof.

The way which can be spoken of is not the way.  On the other
hand, the way I just mentioned can therefore not be the way.
Welcome to Taoism, have a nice day.

If God (or any given creator) cannot be explained in human terms,
then any discussion of Him is essentially meaningless, and its simpler
to proceed as though He does not exist, after all, anything which
has been said of Him is no more than white noise, and you cannot base
any actions on any of it.

God said "don't eat the apple..." did he mean it or was he just
yanking your chain?  No matter what answer you give, I'm forced
to remember that you are human and can't really explain Him... so
I'll have to decide whether to eat the apple all on my own.

Happily, Brell's existance is much simpler to prove.
Why do you think alcoholic content is referred to as Proof, anyway!
