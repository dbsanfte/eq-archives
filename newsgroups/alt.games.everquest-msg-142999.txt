I'm looking for +INT items for my DE Necro in mid 20s.  I've not had much
time to play in the past few weeks (quit the week after Bazaar went up), but
now I've got the chance again so I'm back.  I've only got about 500pp extra
so can't spend allot.  I want to buy as much as I can for as little as
possible.

Can anyone recommend good items and about how much they're worth (Solsik Ro
server if that makes any difference also)?
