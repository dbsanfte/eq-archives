I've been killing wisps in WCommons, not particularly because the exp is so
great from them, mostly because I need the plat from the lightstones for my
spells and new gear (assuming I ever -get- to 19) I was killed twice by Xytl
(not in one night) and once by Gix when someone trained him on me while I
was fighting 3 wisps and a skelly over by the wizzie spires. The last time I
died there, some high level troll was killing the guards and I didn't know
it until too late. I was killing wisps (again by the spire) and had 3 of
them on me -- not a problem, usually -- when a mummy comes up out of nowhere
and whacks me, stunning me. By the time I managed to get to the tollgate, I
saw that there were no guards and that this troll person had killed them
(and was also killing Gix whenever possible, btw). The guards wouldn't have
helped me with the wisps anyway, but they coulda got the mummy off me. I had
SoW of course, never be without it, but by the time I made it to the
tollgate, I was too low in health to get away anyway.

Tonight, I went back to my old methods I found useful elsewhere... I don't
like killing bears, since I am a druid, but I decided that I at least knew
how to kill -those- without dying. Not much anyway. Snare, DoT, Fear, beat
on it while it runs away, wash, rinse, repeat. And I made sure there weren't
any other bears around in case they saw the party and wanted to join, and I
kept away from the sand, over where Xytl and Gix (and presumably the
mummies) are. I also started using F9 a bit more, to get a larger view of my
immediate surroundings. I was so used to grouping with another high level
friend, that I had more or less stopped doing this. I decided tonight that
it wasn't worth dying over (I don't like to use F9 for some reason) and that
I could at least SEE if something came up on me unexpectedly. Like a hill
giant. Or Xytl, or even a mummy. It just aggravates me that I can't kill
them all yet. I know, I know, I ain't no warrior. I'm safer with the above
method, snare, dot, fear, beat, and try not to get hit more than I have to.

I didn't die tonight, so I must be doing something a little more right. Of
course, it could be that I just got lucky ;)

thanks for the input
