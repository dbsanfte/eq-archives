Somebody do this:

Start log
Get in a fight with a heavy weapon. 
Send yourself a message when sta bottoms out.
Keep fighting, preferably the same mob.

Wash, rinse, repeat.

Once you have a sizeable log of this, separate it into stamina up and
stamina down.
Parse both logs for damage output. The sheer mass of data should
average the two fairly well.

Any difference between damage output with and without?
