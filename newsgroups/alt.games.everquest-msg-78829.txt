Well, I don't normally curse at people ingame. In fact, I *never* have,
before this. I normally confine my language to skills which I have a mastery
over, and, though I was a truck driver for 7 years, cursing was never one of
those skills. He mainly pissed me off because, had that guard NOT been there
a few minutes earlier, I would have been dead. Half a bb gone, just because
he wants to kill guards, when there are certainly more acceptable targets in
the game for his lvl. (hell, he could have gone to WC and killed Gix and
Xytl!) I don't mind if they kill off ONE guard if there are 2 standing
there, but I damn sure mind if they kill both of them off for no reason. He
was in his 30's, so there was not much reason for him to even *be* in EC,
unless he was raising faction, and I'm pretty sure that wasn't his gig,
since he was killing *guards*. (please correct me if I'm wrong, anyone!) He
was, after all, a troll.

Anyway, I put him on my /ignore list and then /reported him. Not that it
will do much good. But one can always hope. He acted like he was one of the
12 year olds who use mommy's and daddy's credit card to play.

sigh.

Not going off on you, I'm just still po'd at him. Huh. It's 6am here...
maybe I should go to bed and forget it! :)
