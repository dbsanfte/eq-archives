If the numbers on the 2 servers that I saw the Bazaar at are indicative,
there are about 9000 vendors in the bazaar's across all servers (about 400
per server by 46 (?) servers).  How many were mules?  Maybe 50 to 60 pct (as
a rough guess), Let's say 5000 mules parked and selling.  That's about 6pct
inflation in the numbers.  Still not shabby numbers.
