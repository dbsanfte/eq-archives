Never rooted, sometimes snared, almost always dotted.  IF the mob is snared and
I'm meleeing him, no problem.  But the mobs hit so hard that my bard is
generally running in circles not looking at him while singing DOTs.  If the
target gets low on HP and runs, I don't notice for a bit, and he's no longer
running his smaller circle inside mine, but rather moving in a straight line out
of the circle.  This means I can put some pretty decent distance between me and
him by moving to the far side of the circle from the direction he's running in.
He's rarely snared because its better to let him run full speed and stack more
DOTs on him.

The solution was to bite the bullet and include snare in my song list, and to be
more observant, when he turned to run (and got stuck RIP... as I like to
abbreviate Running In Place) I run over and melee him to death, no problems.

Its been quite a while since I did this (I subsequently ran a shaman to 51,
enchanter to 30, and now a mage to 30), and I heard a rumor that they fixed this
bug, which doesn't occur with mobs anywhere else really.  The thing is, they
weren't healing or LOHing or anything, they'd just mysteriously get the HP back
in a way that couldn't be interupted or stopped by normal means (nor was it
exhausted as LOH would be).   I did talk to a number of people who reported the
same phenomenum in their play at the time.
