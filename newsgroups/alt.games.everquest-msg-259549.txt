I use DSL at the office for all business needs and cable at home. 
Frankly, I haven't noticed any significant difference in performance. 
My cable company, Comcast, has annoying outage problems from time to
time, which I haven't encountered with DSL.

Of course, I would NEVER use my office computer for online gaming, so
my comments about its performance are just, er, extrapolations.
