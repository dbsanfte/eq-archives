I would expect your contract says something like a 7.5 hour day, with
the posibility of reasonable overtime. My guess would be that you would
be able to go to work at "6am" in June (I guess that would be about
midnight real time ?) work for about 10 hours and then clock off till
early one morning in July. (The next time 6am would happen)

Sounds like you would win both ways. Either that or all the other work
you do in June / July would be over time so I guess that would mean time
and a half. Win - Win - Win.
