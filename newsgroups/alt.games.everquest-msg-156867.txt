Spot on, it's a patch for an expansion, it's guaranteed to be broken.
Of course you could say that they would have learnt by mistakes made on the
previous three expansions but really it is us that need to learn that Verant
cannot do a major patch (to EQ) without "breaking" something in the process.
Just chill, don't play for a couple of days and it'll all be working
normally by Saturday.

Lets just hope that it the fact that EQ is the problem (ie fix upon fix upon
fix) and not Verant or EQ2 and SWG are just gonna be more of the same.

Ok, this is easy for me to say as I spend more time using EQ as a
replacement for IRC than I do playing :ï¿½)
