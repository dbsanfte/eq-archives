Hmm, how do you figure that? 768 synchronous DSL = 1536 "total" theoretical 
bandwidth, while cable = 1756 "total" theoretical bandwidth. These are 
theoretical limits tho. Here are my actual numbers from a preliminary test 
at BroadbandReports.com:

Cable:
1394 down
232 up
1626 "Total"

DSL:
550 down
682 up
1232 "Total"

> but also because 1) cablemodem is a shared wire

This seems to be a controversial topic, denied vehemently by cable operators 
and by some in this thread. I don't know how to evaluate the claim because I 
haven't seen any hard refutation or support of the idea, just a lot of 
claims and counterclaims. The most authoritative word I've heard on this 
(and it isn't very) was an article in Maximum PC in one of their "Debunking 
myths" series, claiming that in fact cable is shared in some significant way 
that DSL is not. But as I recall the article was just as conclusory as the 
comments here and didn't really provide me with any hard evidence. I'd love 
to see something more definitive on the topic.
