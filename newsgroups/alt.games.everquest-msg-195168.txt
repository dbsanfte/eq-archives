Hi,

get used to it ...

With every patch ( ok, they are not each week ... ) they will mess up the
game and "improvements" wont work. This will make new patches, repatches and
rerepatches necessary as the game isnt playable anymore ... So it always
will take about 1 week till the crap they did is made playable again ... And
like you will see with this patch too, the estaminated downtime is never
correct ( out of 6 hours for 2 (!) little changes they ll make again 10-11
hours ), then you have to test the changes in game till they see that it was
no good ... server down, trying to fix their selfmade problems ...

Why do you think eBay and other auctionsites are full of accounts now with
chars nerfed with their last patches ( charm ect... ) ? Is no fun playing
them anymore ... And with each "patch" it gets worse ... If its a strategy
to start letting EQ die for EQ2 or something, they do a great job ...

Anyways, have fun in game (if possible)

Christian
