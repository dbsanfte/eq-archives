That's what I was wondering...  The game currently has
planar homes of just a few of the gods (Innoruuk, Cazic-Thule,
Tunare, Bristlebane).  But there are a *lot* more gods in
the game.  I count 23 of them, minus the 4 already covered
leaves 19, which is suspiciously close to the "18" new
zones listed in the "Planes of Power" interview.

Hmm...
