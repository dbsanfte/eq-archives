I have know a very few Mensans, and it has been my strong impression
that they weren't in the group because of a lack of security or
confidence, but rather because (like any club, I suppose), they craved
the company of people with whom they had something in common.

All such organizations are based on fairly artificial criteria, but
that doesn't make them any less enjoyable to the members, which I
suppose is the real point.


"Well, I don't know any lepers, but I'm not going to run out and join
one of their fucking clubs."

God, I love that movie.

>Personally, I would rate common sense far above IQ. 

I would too, if I had any :)

I was gifted with high intelligence as a youth, but not with much
common sense, and even less discipline. I discovered at around age 20
how little use one trait was without at least one of the other two. I
have since learned about the other two the hard way.
