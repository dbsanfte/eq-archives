Anyone playing EQ over a wireless home network?  I currently just have a
cable modem connected right to my PC via ethernet.  I just got a laptop with
a D-Link DWL-650 wireless PC Card.  I want to use it at home as well as
school so I was thinking about going all wireless.  I'm looking at the
D-Link DL-711 as the broadband wireless gateway, and the DWL-520 as the PCI
card for my main computer.  So basically, cable modem to wireless gateway,
wireless PC Card for laptop and wireless PCI card for pc.  PC will be in the
same room as the gateway/antenna, laptop will never be more than about 50
feet away form it.  Anyone running EQ over a wireless setup like this?  I
know these products claim 11Mbps speeds, but is there any added lag at all
to the servers?  Thanks for any experiences out there.
