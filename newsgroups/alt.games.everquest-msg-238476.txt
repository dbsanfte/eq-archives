Most of Annie's points were valid.  And yes, I quit EQ in part because I
found that I was looking to start a relationship on EQ.  It is a degenerate
method for finding a relationship.

There was a second woman whom I met in the game not too long ago while
playing one of my alts.  After a few weeks of talking to her, grouping with
her, meeting her in-game friends, I found myself attracted to her as well as
being an EQ friend with her.  This woman told me she was married in RL, that
the marriage wasn't very strong, but that she wasn't looking for anything at
the moment.  That's fine, whether it was the truth or not, I was elated that
she elected NOT to play games with me.  I didn't hunt her down for cyber
sex, I never stalked her (though I did annoy her a few times with some of my
antics).  We never played games.  I grouped with her and her buds on
multiple occasions.  I confided quite a few things in this woman, and she
did in me as well.  She actually seemed concerned about what was going on in
my life, as I was concerned about hers.  She seemed genuine, an actual
friend, and Mellissa was not.  Mellissa was never after making friends in
the game.  She told me she stayed away from strangers, but OH how she leaped
to the chance to group with me sometime when I suggested it that night.  She
didn't want a friend, and then she was giving me the "let's be friends
speech".  THAT was pathetic.  She should have tried the "get lost" speech,
much more direct and honest, and I would have had respect for her for that.

Especially in EQ, women need to tell men, "I wanna get cyber busy with ya,
but I have no interest in a RL thing. (or) I wanna just be friends with ya.
(or) Go away. (or) etc."  Just be direct!  Don't be "touchy/feely" as
frizbee put it in one of his posts, and misleading, wishy-washy.  Don't
waste a man's time by playing games, and then thinking of him as a stalker
when he doesn't know what the frick is going on, so he has to ask "Are we
done here?  Is this it then?  We grouping even?" over and over again to
reach peace of mind.

Who knows?  Maybe she just wanted EQ gifts from as many guys as she could
get.  I wouldn't slide it past her now that my insanity fog has lifted and I
see her for who she is in real life, and what she says of her husband to
strangers.
