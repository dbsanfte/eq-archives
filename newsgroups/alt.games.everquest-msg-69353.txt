Not long.  You can actually use a world processor to open up eqgame.exe and see
the listing of the sayings; doesn't look like it was something that took too
long.  It's probably like Gems--someone's lunchtime project.

I, too, like the status bar; I wish we had one on the char loading screen,
too.  And I love all the little sayings.  =)
