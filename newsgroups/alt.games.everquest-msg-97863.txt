I have a lvl14 troll shaman.  For about the last month or so the SLAM button
will not transfer to COMBAT buttons.  I'm sure I had it previously setup
that way.  I can right-click on an empty COMBAT button and the SLAM ability
shows up as an option.  But when I select it, it does not copy over.  I
think this has been a bug since a couple patches ago.  Either that or I'm
playing waaaaay too much EQ <g>.
