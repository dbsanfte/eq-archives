Oh, and one small thing that no-one may have mentioned yet - we're
pretty much a bottom posting newsgroup here.  So, when you quote something,
snip out anything that isn't relevant to your reply, then post at the
bottom.  That way, anyone who comes in in the middle can read the points
in the order in which they were made.  It's also a good idea because it
avoids needless flame wars.
