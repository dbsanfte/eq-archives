Well... I think the beliefs based on what changes he made, he did
say he was 'replacing' the Old Testament, are Christian beliefs.

Hmmm. I don't see how Christianity could exist... until after he was
crucified and rose again. He could know the result of his actions
and of his being crucified, and knowing that Christianity would
result, that would make him Christian.

But I'm not very good at religious discussions.

I somewhat lean towards agnostic these days. Mostly due to the right
ewing flakes that have taken over Christianity... I have no desire
to be mistaken for one of them by anyone.

They are self starters...
