Those members have also spent poins, have they not?  I imagine they're
pretty much buring points as fast as they can get enough to get an upgrade.
You're raiding less often, so you're building up points less often, but when
you get to the point where you've built up enough points to buy an item,
then you can get your reward.  It may take you longer, but you were also of
less use to the guild (due to less raiding).  In the mean time, those who
attend more raids will build up more points, and use those same points to
buy more stuff that drops in the more raids they go to.

In the end, you both have uber gear that is in line with your value to the
guild raiding program.
