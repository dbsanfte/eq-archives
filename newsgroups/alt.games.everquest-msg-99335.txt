One of the focus items has a chance (up to 20% at high levels, IIRC)
to eliminate the component cost of a spell.  That's great stuff for a
clerics or enchanters burning peridots, of course.  It's even better
stuff for an enchanter enchanting precious metals (component is an
unenchanted bar of the metal) or a cleric imbuing gems (component
is an unimbued gem.)

Buy a stack of Velium (around 230pp each), enchant it, sell it back
and look in your inventory for the four "extra" bars that weren't used
and sell them too.  That's a profit of around 1kpp per mana bar at high
levels.   A cleric (dwarfs or gnomes do rubies, for instance) would get
around 300pp starting at level 29...

Oh, did I forget to mention enchanters get their first enchant spell
at level *eight* and that the same "trick" works perfectly well then?
Sure, it's got lower returns, but it's still free, quick, totally risk
free cash flow for anyone who can twink an enchanter or that has
a level 29 or higher cleric...

And forget the enchanter:  a Brell cleric with mage friend that can
summon mod rods and the focus items can effectively imbue
gems non-stop even with CHA gear on to get the best possible
price.  And the gems are sold by vendors the cleric is likely to have
at max ally.  And the spell only takes six seconds to cast.

That's reason to bring the servers down and patch, IMO.
