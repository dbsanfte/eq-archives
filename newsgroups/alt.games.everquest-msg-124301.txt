<snipped: some great information on charm kiting for bards>

One thing you forgot to mention was the change made to how xp is distributed
when using a pet.
When it comes to bard charm kiting, if the charmed pet does all the damage,
it will take 75% of the xp. If you do ANY damage whatsoever, you get ALL the
xp.
My technique is just to hit the mob with a few doses of bellow as Im waiting
for charm to break.
