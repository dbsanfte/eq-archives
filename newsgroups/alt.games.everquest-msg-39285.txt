To make those really long line auctions, you need to use the chat
window, can't social them.

The other method you can use (as mentioned elsewhere in the
thread) is to social it as a multiline entry, with pauses.  You
can easily get three decent lines this way, which is more than
enough to describe any single item.

I make a seperate social for each item I'm auctioning,
in their own bank... my auction bank... you have
ten banks, after all, how many socials does one
character need?

This way I can auction item one two three
four... talking to someone about item
three I can go 1 2 4 1 2 4... or hit 3 again
if they have a question that I know my
auction answered.

I also use the shift up arrow thing, say
when there's not quite enough room...
I hit the social once and then up arrow
and add the last detail.

The big flaw with the up arrow system
is that it demands your attention.  If
you get to chatting, either with friends
on an unrelated topic, or about one
of the items you are selling and how
you got it, what its good for, how
you think Verant screwed it up in
some way or so forth... well, its easy
to blow your auction line clear out
of the up arrow memory list.

With the social plus up arrow, at least
there's only a short additional few words
to add in.

Also, its easy to eliminate items you've
sold, just delete em out of your social
bank.

And its no longer necessary to dedicate
time to autioning, you can hit it once
when entering a likely zone, keep chatting
with your friends, fight, do whatever you
like, and hit that key when you feel like it.

I know, you are all thinking "have fun and
sell stuff at the same time?  What does he
think this is, a Game?"
