Beastlords have a great advantage with their pets.  Your pet heal is very
good for little mana and can let the pet tank the mob while you heal it, and
then jump in near the end.  Even better is the DD proc-ing buff you can drop
on it makes that much more useful.

I have used the pet as crowd control in the event of overpull, and either
healed it, or let it die and just re-cast it.  After all, it's a
no-componenet cast that is pretty bad-ass even without any buffs.

At higher levels the pet gets x2 and x3 attacks, ripostes, etc, etc, and
makes the BST a very efficient solo class.
