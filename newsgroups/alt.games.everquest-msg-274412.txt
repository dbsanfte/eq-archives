Well I see your point.  Certainly communicating by typing has a disadvantage 
over the spoken word, but the emoticons are used to give the flavor of what 
your saying.  Sarcasm is a great example where you mean exactly the opposite 
of what you say.  Spoken, the sarcasm comes through in most cases...written, 
it's up to the reader to figure it out.  Hence the emoticon clues.

In any case, I still think she overreacted to the initial 'bastard'...
