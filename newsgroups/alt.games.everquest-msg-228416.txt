For grits and shins, here's a glimpse of what they have on SWG- everyone 
has a small radar screen on their screen. This radar can be sized at 
whatever level of detail you wish. It includes all mobs and players. 
They are even coded- red=aggressive, white=npc, yellow=nonaggressive, 
and other colors for the player faction, with your faction being one 
color, and the enemy another. It marks direction and swivels as you 
move. This is in addition to the Planetary map with lots of bells and 
whistles, and the overlay map for your immediate area (with mobs). You 
can easily avoid any reds by runing out of aggro range. Or sneak up on 
the enemy.

That's even more unrealistic, IMO, and makes the game VERY easy.
