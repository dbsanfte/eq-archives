No, as a matter of fact they wouldn't, if you've kept up with the latest EQ2
scandals.

Although the Frogloks were announced as being unlockable at release, it was
just announced (to much wailing and gnashing of teeth) that the quest to
unlock them will be added about two weeks from now in the May 2005 update.

See Moorgard's announcement

I found this part very amusing ;)

"Had I wanted to invent a coverup, it would have been simple enough to make up
some excuse about how nobody had found the quest yet and so we decided to redo
it."

Am I the only one that reads that and thinks... Gee, that sounds familiar.
Firey Avenger quest, anyone?
