Most people start out with 1HS, since there are so many of them that are
easy to get early on. However, you will want to make your best effort to
collect a variety of weapons, including 2HS, 1HB, 2HB, and piercing.
Switch them off as situations allow and try to keep *all* of them maxed.
Later in the game you will be glad you did, particularly since trying to
max out a skill forty levels later that you totally ignored will be a
nightmare. Once you get up past the newbie lowbie levels and up into the
forties you will run across *many* weapons that are very nice for
warriors, and a lot of them are NOT slashing weapons. Best to be
prepared.

Note: You won't be able to keep them all maxed at every level early on.
But just keep at it. Later on your leveling slows and you'll have time
for them to catch up.
