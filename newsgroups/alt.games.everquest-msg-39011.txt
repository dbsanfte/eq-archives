Part of the reason I don't play Parsifal (anonther in my long string of
night-blind humans) much is because of the hassle of passing around my
only Glowing Stone Band, so I've been thinking of getting him a Mask of
Deception (the one that's Bard/Rogue only and grants Illusion: Dark
Elf).

Does that mask still drop? I haven't seen Dark Elves with Mandolins in a
long time... I have heard that it drops off the Assassin in Lower Guk,
and that it's left to rot since normally there is no one around who can
use it or doesn't have one already. Considering the average level of the
people camping the assassin, what's a reasonable offer for an escort
from the zone line plus being allowed to loot the mask? Would something
like 200pp do the trick, or would I get laughed at? I'd really prefer to
offer money rather than just hang around the corpse like a vulture
waiting to ninja-loot.

Alternatively, what other night vision-granting items are there
available for a Bard? I don't care if it's Infra or Ultra...
