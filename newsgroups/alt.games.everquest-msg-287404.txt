Well, that certainly applies where the beastlord class is concerned.
Aside from that...um, no. (though I wasn't particularly impressed by
the berserker class, either)

Pfft. "face melting" /rolleyes

Anyway, WoW class diversity strikes me as little more than DPS and
healing. If you're a healer you heal. If you're not, you DPS. They
call the various skills and spells by different names, and they have
different graphical effects, but you're still just applying damage,
button press by button press. It just pales in comparison with regard
to combat. In EQ, depending upon the class you play, there can be
several different tactics employed on different types of mobs given
different circumstances. There isn't much to think about in WoW. Hit
the same few buttons (the three or so that do the most damage) over
and over on just about any mob.

If you say so. All I've got to go on is my own first hand experiences.
