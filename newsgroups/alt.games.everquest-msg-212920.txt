Does anyone know of a site that has any map(s) of the revamped Plane of
Hate?.  My Guild has been going there recently and not alot of  them know
the area very well including me.  I've Been searching the net and having
problems finding any . I thought I would ask in here and see if anyone knows
of any.

 Thanks in Advance.
