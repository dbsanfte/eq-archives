The last post I made was a question of aggro control for groups which was
aborted into a pissing contest about chanter's pets.  I guess I was not
clear in what I meant by aggro control, so I guess a better question is:
What is the role of each group member to optimize efficiency of group as a
whole?
This is in reference to how each class should interact with the other based
on your EXPERIENCE( not wild ass guess).  The basic role of each is obvious,
tanks, pullers, scouts, batteries, etc.  What I looking for is the subtle
things that make a good group member better for each class.
I am especially interested in rangers, since my char is one, but all other
classes adding what they know and do helps me know what I shouldn't do cause
its someone elses job.
Thanks
