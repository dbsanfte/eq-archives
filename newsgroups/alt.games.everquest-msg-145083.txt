We're on our third clearance.

Breezed through the zone last night, trying to fit in another Aten
before the patch. 4 minibosses had spawned, first 3 were killed with a
total of 1 death, 1 death, and 2 deaths - 4 deaths combined for the 3
minibosses - 3 from the same overagroer ):oP. Only one that caused
several deaths, was the hardest mob in the zone: TVK, where I died at 1%
- prolly the clerics stopped healing to nuke for the killshot heh

The hard part is most definitely the endless supply of overly tedious
mobs that need to be cleared.
