I don't believe that your wis and int scores will have any effect on the
speed at which your weapon skills increase.
To the best of my knowledge the rate at which you get weapon skill ups is
based on your dexterity. If your desterity is under 75 especially this can
be a problem.
Using the spell "fleeting fury" in combat, as well as one of your dexterity
buffs should really help with your skill raises. I'd advise checking out the
beastlord forums at www.beastlords.org. You may be able to find some
information there on how to create a hotbutton that will allow you to cast
fleeting fury periodically during combat ( Unfortunately I don't have the
info to hand right now ).

As a beastlord with four different weapon skills to raise, it's not actually
uncommon at all for your skills to lag a bit up into the high 40s or so when
levelling slows down somewhat, especially if you are working them all. This
has certainly been my experience. At 57 now, most of my skills are maxed but
I did end up needing to bump a fair chunk of training points into 2hb to
catch it up at one point. Wisdom is definitely going to be of some use as
far as mana pool goes, but intelligence really isn't going to do a lot for
you as a beastlord.

Hope this helps! And I'm sure someone else here will be able to correct me
if I'm off base with the above.

Dave - another low int beastlord :)
