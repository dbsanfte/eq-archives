I guess im an idiot then.  I have 3 points in first aid, level 1/2/3 in
damage mitigation/avoidance/that inreased HP thingy), level 2 in critical
mend, rather then the regen AA skills (plus my other AA stuffs, run3, crit
hits, rapid fd, ambidex etc)

I don't wear a fungi, so I don't rely on regen (see why I didn't get regen
above)
I wear the ancient wyvern hide tunic (40ac one) from ToV

We don't kill any rhags yet.   Prexus is a massively mature server, with a
LOT of high end guilds (from the time a server first was done on Tunare and
AoW, it was repeated by an opposition guild within 1-2 weeks)

We pharmed the IV in the first few weeks of Luclin (possibly a first on all
servers), and the other bosses (THO etc).. but currently were busy with
nToV/Vel enemies.. we only kill RC and Va'dyn etc

Try reading what I said, schmuk.  Im not refering to the slow, Im refering
to that stupid root/mushroomform/dd thing.

My DR is 102 in regular gear (without switching to resist gear)
