Yes indeed.  You'll need a cleric, paladin, or (highly unlikely) necro to
do it, or someone with Staff of Forbidden Rites.  Just like any other
zone.

You get rez, you lose EB.  You don't have mana yet to cast it again.
So there you stand, holding your breath.  I have my doubts, but you
might be able to med enough mana to cast EB before you start drowning,
if your swim skill is high enough

When you get a rez, you start with about a third your normal HP total,
not 1 point.  And you start with your lungs full.  Takes a while before
you start taking drowning damage, watch that "air" bar sink slowly
to zero.

Airless zones are similar to underwater zones, or to being underwater
in regular zones.  You move as in a normal zone, but breath as in
a water zone, which means that you get an air timer when you enter
the zone (or lose EB) which counts down to zero, then you take
damage in hunks that are a percentage of your HP max total.  In
just a few seconds, you are dead, same amount of time regardless
of whether you are a level 1 mage with 20 hp, or a 60 warrior with 6khp

What to do then?  Several plans.

One, drag body to zone line, get res, zone out.  To do this, do -not- loot

first.  Another thing that happens when you get Rez is your Str drops
to zero (plus any item based str you have) so you may easily be "encumber
rooted" in place, unable to move, and drown even though you are a step
away from a zone line!  Med and recover in the other zone, then EB
yourself
and zone in, loot up.

Two, get an EB item, perhaps a loaner.  Wearing this, you have all the
time in the world to recover from your rez.  Hand it back when you
have the mana to EB yourself.

Three, have someone standing by ready to EB you when you get rez.

Four, Get a mage to supply you with a waterstone, and click on it
right after you get rez, for a no mana EB.

I bet there is at least one more plan I'm not thinking of at the moment
