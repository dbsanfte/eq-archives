When did you express a "personal experience"? Your above statement is
an absolute with no foundation or supporting evidence.

You "inferred" that Verant put bugs (either intentionally or through
negligence) into EQ when you made your statement above. You further
inferred that Verant has no interest in fixing these bugs due to lack
of concern about their customers.

I see no "personal experience" in your original post. Just a statement
with no supportable foundation.

>My comment was neither inflamitory nor rediculous.  It reflected what I've

Again you have not provided a foundation for your assertion. Your
blanket statement is inflamitory due to the lack of supporting
evidence. If I said "Whites do not care about blacks", that would also
be rediculous and inflamitory. Even if I based my opinion on the fact
that I have never personally seen a white person give a donation to
the Negro College Fund, or any other Afro-American charity or cause.

"Dissenting" out of ignorance will never be well received. People who
post rants or blanket statements like yours reap the seeds they have
sown. 

>I loaded it, it crashed.  Diagnose my computer from wherever you are all
>you want, that's what happened.  

If loading an application caused it to crash fatally, your computer is
not properly configured or has a serious hardware/software problem. Of
all the problems associated with the launch of EQ:SoL, killing PCs is
"NOT" one of them. Whatever killed your PC was the result of
installing additional software. It is only coincidence and bad timing
that the last software you loaded was EQ:SoL.

Normal people do not walk into a store and shout out that the
Owner/Management "Do not care about thier customers". Normal people
contact store management (email VI customer support) or responsible
staff (GMs in-game or in the Chat rooms), and attempt to resolve the
issue through communication. Normal people allow for the mistakes of
others, and show as much empathy as they expect to receive. Perhaps
these concepts are lost on you.

Have you actually read any of the threads in this forum regarding
Hardware questions? They are filled with people trying to help each
other, and few if any flames.

The two above statements were both written by you. Read the first one,
then read the second. 

Does the word "hypocrite" mean anything to you?
