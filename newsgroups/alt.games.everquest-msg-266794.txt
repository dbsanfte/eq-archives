    Talon's link has The Source for ten bucks cheaper, though your link
does have a page of pretty darned funny testimonials at to the effects of
this stuff.  I like the ones where the people claim that their turds now
glow in the dark, but then, I'm immature that way.  For those that didn't
click the link, The Source is rated at 7.1 Million Scoville units, and
costs $89.95 for one ounce.

    And believe me, I am tempted.  But... no.  I am not spending close to a
hundred dollars for any bottle of hot sauce, especially one that I don't
believe I would ever be able to use in any application in my own kitchen. 
However, Talon's page does also have a product called Mad Dog's Revenge
which is a cool 1 million on the Scoville scale, and is a much more
affordable $10.95.  This one has the advantage of Lenny being willing to
try it, so I will at least get some amusement at home for it.  Plus, he
plans to take it to work, sit it next to him as he eats his lunch, and tell
his co-workers that they can't have any because it is too hot for them. 
Sounds like we'll get every penny of our entertainment's dollar worth on
this one, even if there aren't fireworks at my work.

   So, here's the plan right now.  Get some Mad Dog's Revenge.  Get a
package of Stouffer's Swedish meatballs and noodles (I've had this
brand/variety stolen from me in the past).  Carefully open the box, peel
back the plastic, and secure a meatball.  Take an unused syringe from
Lenny's printer ink pack refiller, and inject as much in as the meatball
can handle without starting to ooze.  Repeat just for good luck.  Replace
the meatballs, glue the plastic back down, glue the box shut.

   Take to work, leave in fridge.  Listen for screams.  

   I'll let you know when we actually do this, and how it turns out.
