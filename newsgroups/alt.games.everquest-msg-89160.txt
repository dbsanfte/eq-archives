Man did u luck out.  Think I need to switch servers.  I was in LOIO last
nite and got attacked inside the mill but when I looked for attacker there
was nothing there.  I kept getting hit so I put Auto Attack on thinking lag
or something and sooner or later MOB would show.  Well the last thing in my
window was the Professor and so I attacked him and didn't last long after
that.  Petitioned GM thinking it was worth a try since it was an accident
caused by attack by phantom MOB, but it was a no go.  Said if the invis MOB
had killed me it would be a bug, but since I attacked the prof the answer
was no.  Lost a whole yellow bub of exp too.  I'm so bummed.
