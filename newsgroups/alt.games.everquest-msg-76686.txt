Huh? Dangerous how? I've used wolf form many times for traveling and
have np.... as long as you realize that in certain areas wolves are KOS,
and in some areas certain NPC's can see thru wolfform. For instance. You
can zone into Oggok, Turn into a wolf and roam about at will and the
Ogres won't bother you... unless you make the mistake of visiting the
Shaman Guild like I did. They saw right thru the deception and Killed me
so fast it made my head spin...

Wolfform is mainly used for speed while hunting, for looks, and for
slightly greater attack when soloing. However, by the time you get
Wolfform at lv 24, you won't be meleeing while in a group. To play your
role properly, you'll be Buffing, then Casting a damage shield on the
primry tank or tanks, then medding, Healing, medding, healing, medding,
medding, medding..... heh. OR

Medding, Nuking, Medding, Nuking, Medding, medding, and more medding.
That's the life of a Druid I'm afraid... LOL.

traveling. <snip>
