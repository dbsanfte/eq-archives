Well, thank God you applied the scientific method and put me in my
place. Too bad your detailed analysis led you to a conclusion that was
100% wrong.

From the emergency patch message:

"All of the seemingly disconnected problems were the result of a
single bug in EverQuest's communications layer that only reared its
head on servers that had maintained a certain population for a certain
amount of time. Unfortunately, this doesn't occur as frequently as
we'd like on our Test Server, where the effects of this bug never
occurred."

You wouldn't, by any chance, be one of those anti-Microsoft types,
would you? While I realize that a clue is probably wasted on you, I
have a few to spare. Here's one: There is no single correct way to
write software. There will always be a tradeoff between extensiveness
of QC and speed of deployment. I wouldn't write embedded systems for
life support using SOE's method. But, I also wouldn't try to apply Six
Sigma to EverQuest.

We can argue until we're blue in the face about the efficacy of SOE's
development and deployment, but the real yardstick is who's willing to
pay for the finished product. In the field of MMORPGs, SOE's
methodology is ahead of yours by about a half million to zero.

I'm saying this patch was an ugly mess. I'm also saying that it won't
be their last. More profoundly, I'm saying that occasional bung ups
are the price of a rapid patching system that has been at the heart of
a wildly successful product and voted for with almost a half million
pocketbooks (and wallets.) If you can't live with it, you should
QAGAYS.

I don't know. Which numbers of theirs have you independently verified
as untrue?
