Well a slow thats resisted actually seems to generate More aggro than one that
isn't.  Many's the time I've popped a slow on a mob on incoming and had it keep
heading for the MT, while a seemingly identicle mob who does resist turns and
starts chewing a hole in my bear ass.  The fact that I'm taking unslowed blows
while the slowed mobs are going for the guy with the big shiny armor just adds
injury to insult.

Stun, I can't say, my cleric stunned a good deal but never really paid any
attention to what that did to aggro; the point was to stop the mob casting
RIGHT NOW, and then worry about who it was beating on six seconds later.
