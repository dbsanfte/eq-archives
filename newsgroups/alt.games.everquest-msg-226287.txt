I love master looting.  I don't know why, but I do.  I can't do it with my
tanks, but I can with my Druid and Enchanter.  The trust factor is part of
it, but that only applies when I'm in a pickup group instead of with mates.

I don't even care about that extra few plat you occasionally come out ahead
at split (wow, three plat!); in fact, I always tack on a few plat or toss a
few jasper at the vendor to make sure it does comes out even.  It's always a
mystery what's on the next mob, and I love breaking the good news of a great
aug or a new drop in our collection.  It's like Christmas every 90 seconds!
