Then, either way, it's a failing.  I do not hold up American public schools
as a shining example of outstanding education.

So, I've got to ask, how are you so knowledgable about Islamic education?

It seems obvious to me, that anything you say about such a large section of
people is not always going to be true, nor will it always be false (within
reason).  For you to get on your soapbox and proclaim that, yes, there are
Islamic schools or schools in certain Islamic nations that work, seems to be
a little foolish.  Maybe you want to confirm that the sky is indeed blue
while you're up there.  Likewise, not all American schools work (gasp,
shock, amazement).  I figured it was understood that those statements
weren't universal.  Guess I was wrong.
