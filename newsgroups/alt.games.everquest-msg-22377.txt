Pvp on blue servers does come in handy occasionally - like for guild run
competitions. We did a newbie run from Qeynos to Freeport, if everyone goes
PvP then there is no chance of cheating. Or there is always the Last Man
Standing competitions. I agree that for normal gameplay PvP on a blue server
is not much use, but you can still have lots of fun with it :)
We surprised lots of people when we were organising the newbie run - about
10 pvp'ers stood around chatting. Most people had never seen that many
before, let alone all in one place!
