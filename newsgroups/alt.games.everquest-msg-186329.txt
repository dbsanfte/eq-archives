My GOD, man, are you THAT desperate to argue with me? Jesus, give it a
fucking rest, asswipe! You're only making yourself look like an idiot
with such silly semantics (Hey, look! I actually know what the word
means and how to use it properly, unlike you!).

Once again, you prove that YOU are the one who argues for the sake of
arguing, not me.
