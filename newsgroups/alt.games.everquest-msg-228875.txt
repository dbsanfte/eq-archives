The more expansions that come out, the longer EQ will live, which benifits
both SONY and the customers.  I dread the day I long into PoK and do a /who
and find 15 players!   Now in places such as DL, which when I first went
there had 30+ players at 9am on a weekday and sometimes 90+ at night (with
often over 100 on weekend evenings) its not unusual to find only 5 or 6
players there in the mornings.  Why?  Expansions, and if there weren't any
expansions thoes 170+ players, most nights, wouldn't be in PoK
banking/buffing/etc.. but instead off playing some other game.  Yes I was
slow getting LDoN because I didn't like the notion of not being able to use
a product I bought unless I could find 3 other people to use it with me but
when SONY lowered the min. group to 3 I got it (wife, father-inlaw, and
myself make a base for a group now) and I'll most likely pre-order the next
expansion as I did the one after PoP (never played there and honestly can't
even recall its name... sad isn't it!!!).  Please SONY keep rolling out the
expansions and enhancements to the game.  I have 2 1/2 years and 1000's of
hours invested/enjoyed in EQ and don't want to have to give it up just yet.
Maybe in 3 or 4 years but NOT now!  And EQII holds no real interest for
me... I'd have to upgrade 2 computers video cards, buy 2 versions of game,
pay for 2 accounts and I'd still want to keep my EQ accounts (3 since I pay
for my fater-inlaws because hes retired and on a fixed income) and all for
flasher graphics and a new engine... not just yet I'm afraid.  Besides from
what I've read trying to lvl 100 lvls while keeping/replacing gear and not
being able to out zone hostle mobs just dosn't appeal to me as of yet....
