Trouble is, where are these people GETTING these numbers?  If you believed
what folks here and many other places have said, hell, by now there'd be no
one left in Norrath.  "Martha, call the bankruptcy court!"

I've yet to see any even  SEMI-reliable source of numbers.  I'd be
interested in knowing them but I'm not holding my breath. :)

As for DAOC and RvR, it's a place where bored EQ uberguilders go.  DAOC has
so little content anywhere (in Hibernia anyway) that there's absolutely
nothing else uberguilds CAN do without getting bored out of their minds.

WITHOUT an uberguild (though looking for one) I'm bored at 17.  Seriously
bored.  RvR sounds interesting & fun (I have maybe 12 hours logged on any
Zek server after 2.5 years of play, that should hopefully tell you something
about me) and I'm kinda looking forward to going with that uberguild.  But
so far RvR is THE ONLY FREAKING REASON to continue playing past 15 unless
you're interested in the fake quests (maybe historically placed but I
haven't been taught anything about the days of Camelot, but would like to
be) or the sheer monotony of trades (which are done a hell of a lot better
than EQ, btw...and *EQ* trades are sheer monotony).
