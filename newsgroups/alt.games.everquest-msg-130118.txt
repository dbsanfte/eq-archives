If you believe that God created the universe then your very existence
is sufficient evidence (note that attempts to invoke logic here tend to
go around in circles, we <are> speaking of faith after all).  As for
your faith in your wife, while history may give you comfort and
reinforce that trust, it is still an act of faith to believe that her
love for you will endure, the past provides no means of ensuring or
enforcing the future.
