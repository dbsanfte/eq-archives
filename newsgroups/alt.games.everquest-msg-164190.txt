Aha..  i know now why you are repeatedly failing.

"due to the cleric and druid both running OOM"

Your using a druid?!?!  Wtf, let them go quad kite some more stuff over
peoples heads, grab a real class instead!  :)

What kind of group make-up have you been using for the execution trial?

I can see how mana could be a problem, but im sure theres something that can
be changed to get around this (other than going out and getting FT 15 heh).
What kind of tactics do you use too?

We dropped our cleric before (already keyed) to key
"otherguild_60_cleric_who_raided_with_us_once" cuz we thought it was the
nice thing to do, but throughout the whole trial though she *only* used
supernal.  Sure in the waves thats fine and dandy, but on the executioner on
an 8ishk hp tank, the only spell thats going to keep up the mana is cheal
(400mana for 1.5ishk hp or 400 mana for 7.5khp) and it sure become fun when
she ran out of mana half way through
