Then someone is doing something wrong in the group.  Sure, the shit can 
hit the fan sometimes, heck, I've been in BoT groups where we lost the 
cleric, and I was the only healer left in the group, and guess what, we 
managed, even with a Paladin as the MT.  In an XP group, not going after 
raid targets, a knight class is preferable as the MT.  A warrior works 
fine, but, quite honestly, barring the right equipment, not as well.
