There is no haste cap from items.  The highest item haste currently in
the game is 41% for a handful of items.  There is a total haste cap,
which is varies based on level.  From 51-59, the cap is 85% haste
total, at 60 is it 105% haste.  
There are 3 types of haste: item haste, spell/song haste, and bard
stacking haste.  You can have one of each type, active, and the newest
bard stacking haste will allow you to go over the haste cap.  A level
60 with a top haste item, Speed of the Shissar or better, and a 60
bard singing Warcry of the VahShir can hit 130% haste.  
Assume this level 60 is using an primary weapon with a delay of 30,
unhasted, which give an attack every 3 seconds, or 20 per minute.
With 130% haste, you attack 130% as often, or 46 times a minute, or
every 1.3 seconds.  The damage per attack stays constant, so it's
pretty clear that if you attack 2.3 times as often, you do 2.3 times
the damage you would normally do, or 130% extra damage.
