>I'm having a blast with my level 30 Iksar SK.

I like my level 9 one.  I've got him camped inside Velketors in case a
sword of pain is gonna rot =p  Dont get to play him too much because I
havent finished twinking him up, Once I get him a decent weapon to go
with the nice 25 AC shield that the Kithicor General gave him during a
friends Rogue Epic fight I'll probably send him back to Kunark to Solo
in Kurms.  

>Granted, I used my 55 Druid to twink him (full set of DreadScale, except for

>items, but...

I dont know crap about the Dreadscale, got a link to those quests (or
are they droppable)?  

I pretty much figured on getting him an Iksar Chestplate, after that
anything would do.  

His Natural Regen and the Iksar Chestplate regen do stack right?

Dont have details on the class weapon quests either.  I had Bricks
parked in Thurgardin to mule Velium Bricks for me, but once I heard
about the Sword of pain I began contemplating twinking him up nicely
for the fun of it.

I only play my alts when I'm bored, and since I've been having a blast
playing my main lately, that hasnt been too much.  I think the Iksar
SK is underrated, but fun.
