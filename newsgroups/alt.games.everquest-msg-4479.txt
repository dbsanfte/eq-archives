    Correct. Spawned in the tower where the Chestplate of the Dark Flame now
drops. Problem was, he was a Nagafen/Vox-level encounter, but could be
dragged out of the tower and trained to zone. And once at zone, had problems
finding his way back home.... made Mistmoore even more unplayable than it
already is. Same thing happened to the sea monster in Lake Rathetear - once
out of his cave, he wouldn't path back and would turn the zone into one big
deathtrap. (Although with the pathing in the water, I'm surprised he didn't
just suicide. :-/  )
