Isn't that one from CT wizard only anyway?

Summoned earring. Saves mana on every nuke cast. No other earring
I would want to wear in the whole game.

Black alloy medallion at least. It has mana preservation 2 on it.
Which saves mana on all spells that your summoned earring doesn't

Summoned ring. Speeds up cast time on all spells. No other ring
I would want to wear in the whole game.

Also use the summoned bracer for extra nuke damage.

Upgrading Int casters is hard since most stats don't really add much
to a caster. Although now focus items make some nice upgrades.

Consider the enshrouded veil if you ever consider chain casting pets.
