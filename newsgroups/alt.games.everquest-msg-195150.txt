Let me share a little story with you.

I didn't do this, but I'll tell it as though I did.

I was in EC killing guards with a friend of mine.  Sgt. Slate was too
tempting a target.  Along comes this lowbie, begging to loot the kills as
he's broke and need some cash bad.  We ignored him.  20 minutes later, he's
still begging us, asking to join the group so he can loot the kills.  Ok, he
can heal...so I tells him that if he's to join us, he will have to throw in
a heal at least once per fight.  He agrees quite quickly, and an hour and a
half later, he'd beaming with his new found wealth and weapons.  He thanks
us and disbanded.  not 10 minutes later, I received a tell from this poor
bastard asking me why the guards in FP were killing him over and over.

Now this next one did happen to me:

I was on my way to TD to smack some Spirocs, and as I'm waiting for the
barge, this kitty comes up to me and says "heal me"

well, who knows who this twit is talking to so I ignore it.

Then I see it again..."heal me"

"I need it"

F9 to look around, see a few other characters standing there...I ignore
again.

ok, so now this twink moves in front of me and says "I need heal"

ok, now I know this moe is talking to me.  As I'm typing out a tongue
lashing about proper manners, numbnuts adds "please" to the request.

/sigh.  I was too slow typing.  Delete verbal abuse and say "sure"

stand, cast Sup. heal  cast Sup heal again.  level 14 and it takes 2 sup.
heals to get from 1.5 bubs to almost full...ok, he's got temperance or
something...can obviously afford a donation for that....but can't afford any
manners.

I then sit down to med to full while waiting for boat and swap spells, I
waited for a "thank you, thanks" or even a "thx"  got NONE.  instead, I get
how about buffs or items.

/gesture

cast camo, board barge.

Another time, I was on my way through North Ro to get some supplies in
FP/spell in commons and I saw this newbie cleric fighting by the grassy area
near FP zone.  she had aggro'd a few cats and was about to go down, did a
driveby heal/buff. (sow, heal, regen, skin, DS).

as I'm running through the tunnel, I get a nice long tell thanking me and
was told how much it was appreciated (no abbreviations or d00d sp33k).
swung around and gave her what I had on me that I could spare (ulthork arms
and gloves and a small amount of plat - enough to get the next level of
spells easily)
