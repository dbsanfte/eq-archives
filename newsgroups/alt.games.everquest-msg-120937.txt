You could get a friend to help you take down the ghoul messenger in West
Karana ( I solo'd it as a lev 29 wood elf ranger). The ghoul's loot is for
the short sword of Morin quest in Kithicor. Sword is 1HS dmg 6 dly 23 and
gives +3 STR and +3 AGI.

Also nearby in Blackburrow you should find it easy to get a rusty spiked
collar and shoulderpads from the gnolls. Both give STR buffs.

This all assumes you were like me at lev 23 and completely poor after
spending all your money increasing your fletching skill.
