Clearly, he was an idiot who simply doesn't understand the value that
an enchanter brings to a group.

I didn't really know what enchanters did, either, until I finally had
a chance to group with a good one several months after the game was
released. When I saw what a good enchanter was capable of, it was like
a light going on in my head.

Not I!

Don't sweat it. While it is a grouping game, the only one whose fun
you're responsible for is *you*. If you were unhappy with the group,
leaving it was perfectly reasonable.
