100% and about as snobbish as can be. How more of an asshole can you
get.

Fact is in COMPETITION you're only allowed what the rules say you can
have. The rules in EQ, which IS a competition of a sort, expressly say
you can't bring real money in.

Ergo, using real money is *cheating*. And you'd get no further
cheating in your fishing tournament than you would in EQ. People like
you aren't buying expensive fishing poles, you are buying fish other
people caught and passing them off as your own.
