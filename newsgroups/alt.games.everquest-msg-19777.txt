I'm not sure reputation ever had any meaning to begin with.  How often in
game do people pass the word about specific jerkoffs?  That would take much
too much time.  I just put them on ignore and forget about it.  When ignore
gets full I delete the first 15 names and by that time they are long gone
anyway.  If you need that information here is a much better way to keep
track I think.  http://www.badgamers.com/
