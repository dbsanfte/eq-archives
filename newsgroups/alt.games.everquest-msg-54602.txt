Are you using the drivers supplied with the card or the latest detonator
drivers for Nvidia?  If you aren't using the detonators, trash what you have
and get them from nvidia's website.
Basically put, most games are generally written around the reference drivers
(those supplied by the chipset manufacturer, not the producer of the card)
simply because it's impossible for developers to write a game around
thousands of different combinations of hardware and OS's.
Also, if you've used different drivers in the past you could have a small
conflict from upgrading to newer ones.  Try uninstalling the drivers then go
into your windows/inf folder.  This "inf" folder contains all drivers on
your system and is hidden.  You will have to go into the propertied of the
windows folder and check "show all file types".  Once you have access to
this folder delete anything that pertains to the video card, reboot and
reinstall the drivers.
I can't tell you how many times this little process has worked for my
clients.  I can't promise everything, but give it a shot.  It sounds like a
driver conflict to me.

Good Luck!
