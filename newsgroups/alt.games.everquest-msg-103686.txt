If you're wanting to be able to perforrm voice-commands, check out Game 
Commander at www.gamecommander.com.

Very nice little program, and it works with almost all windows 
applications.
It won't do free-form input, but will let you set up some nifty multi-key 
"macros".
There is a demo available that will let you set up five single-key 
commands.
Works very well with my Celeron 600 system.
