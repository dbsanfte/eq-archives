This amuses me, the PoDs have been in the game forever, as useless 
dispensers of the red name tags, and as wearers of unwanted drops, the 
fashion models of early norrath.  Good to see them finally getting the 
attention they deserver.

Hmm, a thought, though, I've seen them killed even pre-Kunark, did they 
change the code for them to prevent people griefing?

I'm interested to see what this is all about, sounds sort of like a solo 
complement to the LDoN.  I know its not instanced, but I mean to have a 
goal to accomplish and rewards for doing it other than simple exp and 
randomly dropped loot.  Question being, what are the rewards like?  If 
they are on a par with LDoN then lots of people are going to get into 
this.  If they are on a par with 99% of the quests already in the game, 
well, thats a lot of wasted effort by the designers.

No, most of us won't.  Could there have been a more encouraging thing to 
say?  What are there, 18 classes?  That means 18 people.  Be generous, 
you meant on the server.  Now its what, 360 people? Still a far cry from 
your 400kiloperson audience.

And what about epic 1.5, which seems far more doable from what rumors 
I've heard.  Does it even exist?  Not mentioned here.

OH I'll enjoy it all right.  Since I keep the sound off.  I'll enjoy 
reading the complaints of people about how I'm failing to react to their 
voice tells.  Is this going to slow up my system, though?  Can people 
grief me by forcing their voice tells on me at inopportune moments?  Am 
I going to want to go in to the software to tell it to turn sound off, 
rather than sticking with my "plug in the earphones and don't wear them" 
solution?  See, I actually do unplug so I can hear the ding message, or 
occaisionally in situations where the sound of incoming mobs can be 
helpful to prevent unpleasant suprises.

Hopefully there's an option to turn this little nugget of joy off.

Cost for this aa?  Is it like GOD aa's that cost the equivalent of 
leveling up 20 times?  And what level minimum for it, 70?

On the plus side, for many classes this seems like quite a boon.  I'm 
thinking cleric in particular, where memming stun lock plus both DA plus 
Yaulp plus your pet hammer doesn't leave any room for heals, not that 
anyone should be relying on clerics to heal since they are a DPS 
class... but with that 9th slot you could begrudgingly include a level 
39 spell.

Again, cost and minimium?  And in this case, how much more room?

My berserker will be glad to see this, so he won't have to click off KEI 
in raid situations just to make more room

SO now I have to go in and turn all three off in order to be able to 
raid, instead of just the one?

Does anyone actually run with everthing turned on these days?  I'm 
thinking back to the old Kunark days, but back then we used to have 
macros explaining how everyone in the raid was to turn off all the 
settings... and we'd still be surrounded by people who went LD at the 
boss mob because they hadn't done it.

I guess some people really like graphics, I like being able to walk 
without jitters and don't really care about little shading tricks.

Definately off.  Reccomended specs?  You mean a 286 running windows 3.1? 
  Cause I've never found the reccomended specs to be remotely close to 
whats actually needed to run the game with even a few models turned on.

What I need here is a master switch: "turn new crap off".  I'm going to 
spend an hour finding each toggle, button, slider and switch in order to 
get things running again!

Will it be a splash screen where you can advertise the next expansion? 
Preferably where you can put a skip/order toggle to annoy me with, and 
not zone till I've hit one or the other?

More seriously, will there be a time to completion display?  I'd love to 
see that, tell me whether there's time to grab a soda while I zone.

Can I turn em off?  Where's my master switch, I thought I was done with 
the list of new graphic turn offs!

> - Clerics Symbol and Aegolism spell lines no longer require reagents.

Are you trying to lure me back to playing my cleric?  Not that the 10pp 
cost was really daunting at 65 anyway.  It was a pain at 44, but since 
they stopped scaling up to ever more expensive gems, the pain really 
died off somewhere in the 50s.

I see this as mainly beneficial to buff beggers and buff whores; now 
getting a free buff should be easier since there's no actual cost, and 
at the same time getting paid the same for Virtue as a chanter does for 
KEI won't mean just breaking even.

> - Necromancer pets will no longer require peridots.
What?  A boost for the most powerful class in the game?  Should make em 
require Raw Diamonds instead!

No really thats fair, why should mage pets still cost a malachite but 
necro pets a peridot?

Well thats not how I heard it, I thought it was while the bard was 
moving.  This means that bards can still be in PBAE groups (the mobs 
aren't moving, they are stun locked in place), and can still use their 
song in melee combat, but can't do swarm PBAE kiting.  Since my bard 
never did learn this, but used charm swarm kiting instead, it won't 
matter much to me.  But for many bards, its going to be a nuclear 
sledgehammer.  Hopefully they already have 200 aa and plenty banked to 
spend on OOW AA's... but how are they going to level to 70?

What?  They could before.  I could heal (rangers get a 5 hp heal at that 
level, I got buffed by some newb shaman... what other beneficial spells 
are there?

And Berzerks get no 250 cap?  Whats up with that?

So these items can still be farmed, but can only ever have one user. 
Weird.  I thought the whole idea behind no drop was to prevent farming; 
as far as I know farmers have never actually used the stuff they were 
farming.

I wonder if Attunable items will become regular items on FV once 
equipped, instead of becoming No Drop.

I'll be interested to see this, of course, but I'm not holding my 
breath, as the underlying flaw of not scaling Frenzy doesn't seem to be 
addressed... nor has the (to me) more important flaw of a class which 
relies almost entirely on Stun for its existance leveling up to where 
most mobs are stun immune.

I also dislike the whole scheme of fixing classes by means of AA, when 
most people say you should level to 65 (now 70 I suppose) before getting 
AA at all.  This means your class is broken till you've done all your 
leveling?

Wow, Suspended Minion... SK might get more use out of that than anyone. 
  Or perhaps not, given the current rage for pet pulling.



They forgot to mention Level up to 70.
