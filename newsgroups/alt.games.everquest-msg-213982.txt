Oh, here's one.

There's a time limit on the adventure, which varies depending on
your mission and difficulty.

What happens when you go over that limit?

OK, I understand that you get 30 minutes after the adventure is
over to mess around, during which you can't actually complete the
mission if you failed to do so in the time limit.

But after that 30 minutes is up, then what?  Do you all get ported
out?  Where to?

What about dead bodies?  Do they end up in buried in some mass
grave in Paineel?  Are they rezable after the time limit for the
adventure (assuming they haven't gone over their regular rez timer
limit of course, which I assume can only happen in a raid type
mission)

What if you LD, if you log back in while the mission timer is
still on, do you reappear where you disappeared?  What if the
timer is up, so the dungeon is no more, then where do you show up?

One of the big annoyances of the Trials in POJ was that if you
died, you couldn't simply be rezed back to your body, nor could
you retrigger to zone in to get to your body.  It was possible to
rez someone to their body by rezing them (they'd appear in trials
room, then poof to the graveyard), then rezing them a second
time.  But if you didn't manage that, then they had to wait for
their body to pop in the GY (or summon corpse it if in a rush).
But LDoN has no GY function and the zone doesn't stick around
anyway, so you can't leave bodies in there...
