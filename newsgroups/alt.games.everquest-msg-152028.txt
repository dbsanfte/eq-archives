Matter of taste.

Don't underestimate your warrior. Frankly, too many people look at it the
way that you are - particularly when first starting out - and there
subsequently is not enough of them in the game. Ask any high level raid
leader and they'll tell you how critical warriors are as THE main tank. They
get the most HP, they get to use all the best armor and weapons, and they
can dish out continuous streams of damage with their basic attacks, kick,
bash, etc.. Now, get them low on HP and watch them berserker frenzy with
seeming every hit comming up a crit.

Everyone has their own ideas about balancing in the game, but, personally, I
think that every class has it's role. Some classes are better for groups,
and some are better for soloing, but they all have their place.

Now, as to bards: Bards easily are the busiest toons in the game. Playinig a
bard is downright tiring as you go up in levels because you have a ton of
rolls when grouping or just a ton of things to do even when solo'ing. A
caster cast's their DoTs and then sits back and watches them work, a bard
will twist in a couple, but then has to keep the twist going. You have 8
songs memmed and you may use as many as 6 of them over the course of a
battle depending on a dozen factors. Work, work, work.

Personally, before starting one, I would suggest that you check out the
"What is it with Bards?" thread that Lyrral started a week or two ago, then
checkout www.eqdiva.com, and then just generally get ideas from people you
play with. One of the things that you'll see in Lyrral's thread is that a
bard is not the class for beginners. I had a bard as my first toon, and he
is still my main today, but I always feel like I'm playing catch up with him
because there was a ton of game smarts I didn't have when I started him up.

JMHO.
