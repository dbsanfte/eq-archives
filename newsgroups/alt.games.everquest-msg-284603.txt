According to EQPlayers character search, on The Combine server alone, 
there have been over 103k characters created. Keep in mind that all of 
those characters were created in the past three months. Granted, that 
doesn't tell us how many subscribers are involved, as many have multiple 
characters on one account, but it is also just one server.

EQ is still kicking. No, its numbers don't compare to WoW's, but who said 
they have to for it to be a continued success? I'd bet more people play 
checkers than WoW. I guess that makes checkers the better game than both.
