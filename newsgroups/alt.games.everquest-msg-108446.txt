Well not really weakest, but she has a heavier one, and she has
another one that also has a snare effect. Either of those are certain
death for your typical player going to Ill Omen.

Ignite Blood: 1176
Cascading Darkness: 1152/60%snare

I assume the disease dot was Scourge, but I suppose it could have been
something else (like Plague) which puts it on the same level as the
other two.

Like fighting necros now?

Envenomed Bolt: 1022

Want to know what's even worse? Those all stack (at least, I think
they do, I'm not a necro expert).

Necros are the most dangerous mobs you can fight.
