 An insta-click buff is never worthless. If you're just considering the
speed of jboots vs Run Speed 3, then yeah they are pretty comparable. A
lot of times I'll be running around and not even be aware jboots has
worn off. I just keep it up because of mobs that debuff and such. Plus
it makes a handy mob-timer if you're not trying to be specific.

 If you'll just be soloing a lot and not on any raids, you probably
wouldn't see much benefit of jboots over RS3.
