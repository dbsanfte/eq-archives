Or at least realize when you just have to /pet get lost (i.e., DIE) in
order to save everyone else.  It's only mana and maybe a few cheap
weapons you'll be losing, much better than the alternative...

Considering the size of my guild, I plan on having /pet hold long
before we fight any mobs that this will be an issue for.  Paragon of
Spirit first for sure, though.

Game on,
