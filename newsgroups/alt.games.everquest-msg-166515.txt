3D games cause a lot of motion sickness. It comes from the brain
getting confusing signals about your motion and position. Your eyes
tell you that you are moving and turning but your inner ear is telling
your brain that you are not moving.

Some people just can't handle 3d games like EQ, quake or Unreal.
I have a friend that cannot play for more than about half an hour.
He gets headaches and nausea. He's been playing for 3 years
trying to get used to it but he never seems to. He's tried all kinds of
things. New computers, graphics cards, monitors, nothing seems to
help.

Some people I have helped get over their motion sickness feeling
by telling them to force themselves to keep their head still as they play.
If you have ever watch some people play a 3d game for the first
time watch their heads. They tilt and move their heads trying to see
around corners, its quite funny actually. I showed one friend a new
game and when she moved the character toward a cliff edge and
looked over she actually grabbed onto the table to keep from
falling over the edge!

Your problem seems different than most things I have heard of though.
Sounds like the 3d games are triggering migraine headaches. I also
suffer from migraines as well but my trigger is a food allergy.
The other thing you can do is try playing in 3rd person mode. This
might help disconnect your brain from thinking that the computer
screen is your real view. Also, is your home computer set up like your
work one? Maybe your sitting position is putting strain on something
or cutting off blood supply in your neck?
