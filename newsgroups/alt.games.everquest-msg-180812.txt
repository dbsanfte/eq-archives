Burned out on playing my enchanter, I decided to try to bring back the
fun by creating a new character. I created, then twinked, a monk and a
necro; then twinked some retired characters and played them. They were
fun for a while in a low-grade way but the characters never grabbed me
in the way that the chanter did.

Having blown all my plat on twinkage, I rolled a Vah Shir bard and
have been playing him recently, completely untwinked, and guess what!
The challenge and the fun is back. Scraping enough coppers to buy a
backpack, questing for armour to cover my fur, not being able to buy
my songs til nearly the end of the level; all this stuff feels like an
accomplishment. I am going to enjoy the journey this time and take in
all the sights.

The bard feels fun to play and I like the ability to solo after
grouping for so long. I am getting kitted out in padded armour and
will be doing the buckler, cloak and drum of the Jharin recruit
quests. I am looking for soloable drops/quests to get equipped, if the
group has any suggestions I would appreciate it greatly.
