I finally just retired my level 17 half-elf druid.  I loved playing him but
I didn't know what I was doing when I created him and he only had 85 wis.  I
still wanted a druid so I created a halfling.  I hated it.  I killed him and
created a human druid.  He's now level 6 with studded armor and pieces of
ulthork hide.  A shiny brass shield and my crook of the jagged pine.  He
rocks.

I'm starting to see the good side to this twinking thing.
