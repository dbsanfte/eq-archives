I agree with you that the mobs in PoP are overpowered.  That seems to
have been a, perhaps questionable, conscious design decision though and
is consistant throughtout PoP.  A trend away from the Luclin model where
mobs had gobs of hps towards one where the mobs had reasonable HPs.  So
it would seem that in that context, the charm spells themselves, and not
the mobs are what is overpowered.

I dont disagree with your mudflation assessment, its been happening
since Kunark.  But, they pretty much have to do that to keep people
paying.  I mean, if there are not new toys, new levels, new abilities,
etc. to work for most of the people with 100s of days /played on their
accounts would have quit a long time ago.
