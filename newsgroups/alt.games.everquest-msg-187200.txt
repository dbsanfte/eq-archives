And what you're saying is total bullshit. A quick search for an online
translator brings up "no translation" for "kahir" or "hasan" in Farsi.
A Google search brings up a couple names, but the only relation to
terrorism is the region they're from. By calling it a stretch, I'm not
giving the GMs too much credit: I'm saying that they're going to
require more than the word of some wanker before beleiving some little
child who's crying "That name means terrorist!" out of spite.

Shut the fuck up, boy, you're only emberassing yourself further.
