Originally these were unbreakable.  I remember the discussion in
this newsgroup as people discovered that enchanters weren't completely
crap, (the opinion at release) and worked out tactics using what
they had.  I could swear it was Silverlock (since left - you can
find him in csipgs these days).  He discovered you could lock down
a mob all day long with WTYH and let the melee pound on it.  It was
the way he and his friends first took down a Griffawn.  They nerfed
that within days, making bash break it.  Since the Enchanter pet
bashes, and can't be told not too, this broke it as a safe soloing
tool.  I didn't realize they had made it so general melee broke
it.
