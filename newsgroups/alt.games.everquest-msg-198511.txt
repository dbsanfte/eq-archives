If they are doing this in order to regularly pull, then of course this
is idiotic.  I would like to point out though that if you only want
one beasty, perhaps a named one, from a large group of them, this is a
reasonable (if not cheap) way to get it out of the pack.  Ever killed
Sir Lucan for the Paladin epic?  Then you know what I mean...

Of course, even if that is what these guys were doing, they are still
idiots for thinking Adam's group was kill stealing them.
