The guy remembered me from Beta, which isn't too surprising since I had 
exactly the same name and character model (in fact, I saved the character 
file and re-used it in release) and was an officer in a leadership position 
both then and now. But I don't think he remembered the incident in Stormhold 
until I brought it up, else he wouldn't have so readily revealed his 
identity in the first place. I mean, he couldn't be *that* dumb, could he?

It was pretty revealing to me, however, when he started pouring out his 
apology. It was evident at that point that he remembed enough to feel guilty 
and apologize. I hadn't even said a thing about the incident. No accusation, 
nothing. Just a couple of questions about some character names that could 
have gone anywhere. But he remembered and he knew because he harbored the 
guilty knowledge that he knew I knew, and the jig was up.
