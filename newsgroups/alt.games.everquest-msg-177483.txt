'You're not friends. You'll never be friends. You'll be in love till it 
kills you both. You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll hate each other 
till it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. Love isn't brains, 
children, it's blood... blood screaming inside you to work its will. I may 
be love's bitch, but at least I'm man enough to admit it.'
