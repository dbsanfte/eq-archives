 guild.txt (or .dat) used to be a text file from what I remember and you
could get it from there. That doesn't seem to be the case anymore
though. Maybe it was changed when they revamped the guild stuff awhile
back.

 You could always try every number someday you happen to find yourself
bored. You'll get it eventually!

 Over on Veeshan I know of a guild just like that. The only way to /who
them is to use their number. It's nothing out of the ordinary, just a
simple one word, non-EQ specific name.
