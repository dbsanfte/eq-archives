Aye, thats the "-is- a ranger" part, not like he's a class with aggro 
difficulties like a paladin or SK... usually the problem is the reverse, 
how to keep DPS up as high as possible while not pulling aggro off the 
poor MT.

Berserk does seem to be an aggro magnet on a rangerlike level, though, 
with very spiky damage due to being forced to weild two handers plus 
doing frenzy on pretty much the same schedule as a rogue doing 
backstab's; if I chain stun (which amounts to a 50% slow which stacks on 
top of any cast slow) then the MT does actually have to work on keeping 
aggro; many's the group where I ended up MT not by being best at it, but 
just because we decided it was too much trouble to go to for me -not- to 
get the job.

My defense just hit 209 yesterday , my pre 51 cap on it is 210, so soon 
I'll be a bit less interested in MTing for a couple levels; my parry, 
dodge, and riposte are already capped till 51 so I'll no longer have 
anything to gain till I change class names.  Post 51 Defense cap is 240, 
dodge cap is 175 (up from 125), and riposte cap is 225 (up from 200), so 
then I'll be back in the market for getting hit a lot for a while!

Since I'm ultimately a chain class, I figure its in my best interest to 
cap out defense skills as soon as possible, while the mobs are still 
hitting lightly enough for me to do the job
