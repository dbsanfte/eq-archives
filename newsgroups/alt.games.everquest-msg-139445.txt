Yes.

You target their corpse, cast the spell, and they are offered a
teleport to the body

More specifically, it will bring them to the spot their corspe is
in when you cast the spell.  If you have permission to drag
the body, you can actually move it afterwards, while they are
still zoning to you.

You say "from their spaw point" but in reality it will bring them
from Anywhere.

I say "offered a teleport" because they get a pop up box that
tells them the percentage of exp loss they will recover (none,
in this particular case) and asking to take the rez or not.

Once the first rez is cast, the body can still be rezed to teleport
them back again, but no exp will be returned.

On arrival after rez, the recipient will be low on HP, have no
mana, and be under Rez effects which sap many of their
stats, including strength.  Further, these effects will not
allow certain buffs, notably strength buffs, to be cast on them
untill they wear off.  They wear off gradually, stats slowly
returning to normal levels, before finally dropping away
entirely.
