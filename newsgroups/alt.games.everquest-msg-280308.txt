Yes, it is true.  You also do not get the charm upgrades nor the free AAs 
involved in going through the progression.  Being flagged for time is 
pretty useless however unless you are in a guild that raids time, or have 
an active time raiding pickup pool of players.  An individual player that 
is alternate backflagged for Time will not allow said player to "finish" 
the expansion faster, he still has to join a guild that is actively 
raiding time.  The point behind allowing this was to allow raiding guilds 
to flag unflagged members without having to actually go through all of 
the progression each time.  An unguilded time flagged character will not 
actually be able to do anything in Time, as the content there is all raid 
content.

What they did for the individual player, was change it so that one 
unflagged character can be gimped into a zone with 5 flagged players in a 
group.  Thus, allowing unflagged characters to have a chance to play in 
those zones.  They cannot get flagged for the zone that way however, as 
the alternate flagging method generally requires a raid killing the boss 
mob of the zone in question.
