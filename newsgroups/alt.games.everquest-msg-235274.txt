Well it worked... I observed that a number of items were reasonably
valuable as tribute, and while I expected a deserved nerf incomping on
some of them I figured that tribute buffs at least were within my
budget, and would be worthwhile... I figured I could farm FineSteel at
least  for example, etc... PoK worms or tinkered bait were later news
to me... and i expected them to be nerfed asap.

So I buy the expansion, install it, log in, and find out the tribute
masters are dead. Slick, real slick. So now I'm out 30 bucks and the
one feature I wanted is nerfed right out of the game. Go Sony!

Oh and the casinos are gone too, not that i care that much... but
still ... this isn't rocket science... and its the 2nd time round...

>Perhaps these things were intentional?

A great big conspiracy?

Nah... then we'd have to give more credit to SOE than they've ever
earned. If they attempted a conspiracy it would fail, miserably. The
only way SOE is going to be credited with a conspiracy is if they're
lucky enough to blunder around looking like they really have a deeper
purpose... 

We can tell they don't though, because if they did, then they'd
blunder it.
