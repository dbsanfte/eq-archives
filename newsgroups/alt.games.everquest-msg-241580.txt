My fun, fun, fun experience with an unexpected bug from Thursday's patch:

  From the files of the patch message that didn't make it to release, 
but should have:

"Greetings, Norrathians! As part of the DX9 upgrade, we've added in some 
new features to the evacuate and succor lines of spells to make your 
travels more interesting. Enjoy!"

Translation:

We're down in the basement of Ssra yesterday afternoon, helping some 
friends in the mines who need some metal off the named skellies. It's an 
odd group makeup, with no chanter, but we're doing fine and having fun. 
Necro is mezzing (single target only) because if you've never fought 
there, the chain agro can be nuts.

We're consistently keeping a stready stream of mobs going with no more 
than three or four in camp at one time. Then as luck would have it, one 
of them gates. Our puller has been bringing them in from all over the 
mines so there's no telling where exactly this one went to. In short 
order we find out as more than a dozen skellies start streaming into our 
camp to say hello to us.

The necro is slowly starting to melt down into a puddle of "Oh Fuck". 
We've got about a half dozen mezzed, several on the tank, and another 
five show up. I say the hell with it and punch the evac key. Screw it, 
we can just IVU back in shortly and keep going, right? No biggie.

So and so and etc. create a mystic portal, blah blah blah.

LOADING. PLEASE WAIT.

We arrive at the zone in. Well done, Jakiss. Good save, old chap. Now, 
let's invis up and...

YOU WILL NOT EVADE ME, JAKISS.

Boom! I'm back in the mines. A dozen skellies commence to wailing on my 
1.7K HP ass, and my epic skin was already beaten away before the evac. I 
go down like a Battery Park hooker on welfare check day.

There's your change that wasn't mentioned in the patch message. (One of 
them, anyway.) Evac will not necessarily clear aggro now.(At least for 
the person who casts it. Nobody else got summoned.) I found out quickly 
because all the mobs we were fighting can summon. You may want to 
mention this to your porter until this gets fixed. Good idea after an 
evac to immediately zone out and back in, rather than finding out later 
you're on the hit list of seventy mobs all across a dungeon on your way 
back down.

So, a big steaming pile of FUCK YOU to Sony on this cheerful Friday morning.
