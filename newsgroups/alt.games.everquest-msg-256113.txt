Hughes is saying that since the pookas have a very low MR, they tend to 
stay charmed close to the full duration.

I don't know whether thats true or not, but I don't think he was saying 
it can't break early on them, just that its less likely.

Mentioning the max duration seemed to be merely in service of the point 
that by using invis to break the charm you can reapply debuffs/snare 
more easily, with a fully ready crew, instead of relying on reaction 
time each time it breaks.
