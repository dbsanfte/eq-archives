I ran my shaman, largely solo, to level 52 and was still better
off tanking for my pet than either leaving pet out of it and just
root/rotting or having the pet tank and healing him; pet damage
was a significant... no thats not enough, pet OUTDAMAGED me
seriously by 49, so much so that at one point I aggroed two mobs,
cast slow and DOTS on both and then split them, me on one and my
pet on the other, my pet killed his and was over helping me out
before my target was down to 75% of its health.  This is when I
stopped putting "attack" on.  But my pet was also down to under
25% of his health, while I was nearly full health.  My HP, HP
buffs, regen, and Stoicism combined to make me a much better
sponge than my pet... and once I had stoicism I could canni even
while taking a beating from most slowed mobs.  Putting Stoicism
on a "real" tank is silly, because it Slows him, but shaman melee
output by that point is crappy enough that slowing the shaman has
little effect, in fact as I said I actually turned attack off so
as to benefit from my mount for more mana supply.  This last
trick might not work as well with a rogue partner, though,
keeping aggro off the pet is a simple matter of just being in
melee range of the mob.

Kiting with melee is always onerous, although its great with a
pet, as they have the advantage all EQ mobs have which is a
computer taking care of their movement.
