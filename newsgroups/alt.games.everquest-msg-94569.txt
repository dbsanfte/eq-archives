yeah that is the biggest help right there. Repetitive stress disorders
are what they are because of the repetitive sameness, go figure!
So even switching to a keypad sometimes for doing some things would 
help. If I had one when I started playing a bard I'd probably still be
playing it. I found out that around level 15 it magnified the starting
of possible carpal tunnel problems 100 fold. I eventually had to give
up the bard since song cycling became painful and without being able
to cycle, which is playing a bard well, there seemed no point.

Something else I've always wondered about.. is it possible to have
more than one keyboard you can actually use.. on the fly? Like for
example, having an ergonomic and a regular keyboard or two kinds of
ergonomic ones you can switch off from? Even an "ergonomic" one can 
probably cause distress due to its sameness while switching back and
forth would be enough of a change.
