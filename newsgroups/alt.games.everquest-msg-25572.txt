Nice choice he could also try Yersini Apestis  (Yersinia
pestis is the bacteria that causes bubonic plague).  Trepo
Nema (the Genus name for the bacteria causing Syphilis),
Escher Coliform (Escherichia coli, or E. coli, Coliform
being a class of bacteria associated with the intestinal
track in general.  E. coli just being one type of coliform.)

Sorry to have rambled, my degree is in Microbiology, so I am
somewhat familiar/interested in names like this.
