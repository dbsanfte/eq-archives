It's a very good point. I know how to move an add (that's why my macro says
that I've *parked* it) and I've used the technique very successfully on
occasion, but I guess I don't do it nearly enough. Your point about it being
easier to move the add than the fight is a very good one and one that this
Shaman will keep in mind.
