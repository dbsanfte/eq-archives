A PL'd chanter, who has never played before...good luck! =p

For an experienced player, I guess PL is ok...but the first time you go from
0-30 on yer own, is tough, and should be a learning experience...at times
when it isn't going to really affect anyone if you mess up.

But saying that, we was going to do a similar thing for my bro when he gets
EQ online, but pl an easier character to play, while he 'normally' levels
another character, when we are doing other things, I felt this was a good
compromise between the two, as we can play together, and he can still learn
on his own (and from us).

Still, though, it is best for people to play the first month or two, without
too much outside help, striving to become better was fun for me, having
everything handed to me on a plate, would of made me bored of eq, very
quickly, I think.  Doing the newbie armour quests  also had good learning
factor, the first time you do them.

Any twink gear you get now, will soon be out of date, unless you spend a
greater amount, I would go for cheap +hp and +mana items, replacing these
with +hp and +int items at level 40ish, when these items do get replaced,
keep em stored away in case you can make use of them again, for  a young
character.
