The problem is there are really three death penalties in EQ:

1. The time to make up the XP loss.

2. The loss of abilities if you lose a level.

3. The temporary loss of your equipment until you go get the corpse.

Note that if you died because you got in over your head, #2 and #3 mean
that when you go back for the corpse, you are even less likely to be
able to handle things then before.

An adventure game should encourage people to push their limits.  The
combined effect of the three EQ death penalties is to encourage players
to play it safe, or make sure they have higher level friends to help
with corpse recovery.

Dark Age of Camelot is trying an interesting system.  When you die, you
come back with all your stuff, but you have an XP loss.  A grave marker
is left where you died, and if you go back to that point and pray over
your grave, you get half the XP back.
