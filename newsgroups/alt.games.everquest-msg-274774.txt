Made it into Everfrost, but there has to be more to the zone than I
have so far discovered on my own.  I got the Icemaiden door, but
nowhere else in that direction.  I found the cave in the water, but
there is a major see invis monster called Undertow making me not want
to risk going that way if I don't need to.  So what am I missing?  How
do I get to the rest of the zone, and to Permafrost, for example?
Thanks for help.
