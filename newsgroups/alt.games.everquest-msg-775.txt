After another night of not finding a group for my 7th lvl monk (though I
still solo'd pretty successfully) I got to wondering.  Are monks welcome
in the lowbie group structure, and if so what role do they need to play
in the group?  Puller because of their speed? (Assuming nobody with SoW
capability.) Just a tank? (Which I didn't think likely as I can't
"taunt" and have a much worse armor class than similar level warriors.)
No spell capabilities............ what do I have to offer a group that
would make them want to invite me?
  Or should I just go back to playing my wizzard? (Same thing there...
what does the wizzy do in a 6-8 lvl group?)
