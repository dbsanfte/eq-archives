   Yep.  Right now Lentea is a couple of yellows shy of hitting 30, with
luck she'll be there by tomorrow.  And ya, after that I would be fine
with putting in the time to do that.  I can two box Lentea (or try to
talk Lenny into playing her), group her with you to, and then baby sit
and even single pull reds for you guys.  I would guess that a group of a
mage, beastlord and monk would be pretty good at chewing through stuff
fast.
