    If you had been watching the LDoN rankings with a character that had 
never done a LDoN, you could get a rough gauge of how many have cancelled 
(cancelled characters are removed from the rankings). My ENC has gone from 
10800th to 8250th - about a 25% cancellation rate on my server.

    The two team Zeks are already talking about it. No idea if it'll go 
through, as there's a fair number of players opposed. It's degenerating into 
a cross-team versus pure-team debate. The Legends server looks to be heading 
for disaster first, now that the top guilds there have pretty much all left 
for other servers.

    Appearances. If you consolidate before the players request it, it looks 
like EQ is a sinking ship. It is, but if you make it look bad then there'll 
be a stampede for the lifeboats rather than a slow, orderly move.
