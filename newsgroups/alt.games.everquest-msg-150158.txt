I have made a huge comment to VI about the whole problem and my solution a
while ago. Some of my prayers where heard, and according to rumours more of
those prayers will be answered in the future.


1. Let the groupleader adjust how many he wants to be in the group (take
away the cap of 6, and just leave it for the group to expand how they see
fit. People who level too slow will leave, and people who like socialising
will stay and have fun etc). How many times have you wanted to invite a poor
loney soul and not been able to due to the 6 people cap? I feel VI are
actually limiting one of their own greatest game features here. This is
something many competitors cannot do due to technical limitations, BUT.....
VI aren't doing it either and they have the technology! They are
ither;  -sleeping, -refusing to see the potentials of their own code,
or -just plain suck at game design.


2. Problems with ninja looters. Leader can set the "group rules" by right
clicking the group box and bringing up the "GROUP PROPERTIES" window (or
something like that) to set the following:

1. Set group leader.
2. Assign looting Rules.
   Looting rules available:
      a) - Alpha Loot
      b) - Designated Looter
      c) - FFA
