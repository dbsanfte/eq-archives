Oh, yes, and I still have it on 5.25 diskettes.  16-colour side-mover.  You
wander around, doing quests, and trying to beat the AIs that are trying
to... do something, I've forgotten what.  You pick up a 'deck, you can jack
into the matrix and go find databases which you try to hack.  That's where
you meet and fight the AIs.

The warez you can buy are limited; you get better warez by hacking the
databases.  That's also where you find clues to your next target.

I ran into an interesting bug in that game, and actually called up the
makers at the time.  Found out that what I had really was a bug, and a weird
one.  If you're fighting one particular AI, it sounds like Dirty Harry.  If
you fire Arrest Warrant 1 at it, it dies instantly.  It's the only AI I
found with a weakness like that.

Also, in the spirit of the game, I hacked it.  Found out where it stored my
personal and bank cash, then modded the values to give me max in both.  The
world's a better place when you're a multi-billionaire.
