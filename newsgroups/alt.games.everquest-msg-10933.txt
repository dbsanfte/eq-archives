Really? hmm when I do it the number is normally single digits ;�)
One of my guild once won a role with an 11.
I have the "sod's Law" kind of luck...if everyone roles low, I win it with
something in the 90's if everyone rolls mediocre, like 30 -50 I get
something under 10. PLus, the more you want the item, the lower you roll :�)
