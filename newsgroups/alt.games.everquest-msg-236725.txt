Lol. I was reading the long diatribe about D&D in that site, getting pretty
indignant at times, when I suddenly realized: I'm not a Christian! Why
should I worry? ;)
Anyway, I found this particular passage quite amusing:

"A walk through any gaming store can prove that. For example, there is now a
whole line of materials based on the hellish H.P. Lovecraft Cthulhu mythos,
a form of magic that we practiced in the darkest days of our satanic
career - a system of magic prominently featured in THE SATANIC RITUALS by
Anton LaVey! Contrary to the ramblings of D&D defenders like Michael
Stackpole, the Necronomicon and the Cthulhu mythos are quite real"

The Necronomicon!! Real!! A Lovecraftian's wet dream!!
