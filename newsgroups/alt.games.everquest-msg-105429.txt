I am curious about one thing tho.  Just how big is the difference in
sustained damage between a Wizard and a melee.  I've seen Wizard nukes
contribute significantly in reducing damage to the melees.  I can
remember a couple of pickup groups in DL that definitely started
experiencing a lot more downtime after the Wizard left.  Both of these
groups had a Druid for primary healer, and both Druids got unhappy
about having to spend so much mana healing when the mobs started
living longer (seem to be more than a few Druids around who hate to
heal).  Both of the Wizards were fairly good at judging the moment to
drop a nuke in and turn the (snared) mob.  Neither had to med thru a
fight very often, even tho one group had a stereotypical Barbarian
Warrior for a puller ("hold pulls!" "k, after this one, three inc").
