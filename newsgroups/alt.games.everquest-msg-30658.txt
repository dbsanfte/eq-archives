Sayyyyyy thanks!  I never thought of that.  And you're right, I pass by 
them all the time, they're never never NEVER camped. :)

Now see, I went there (did I mention that in this thread or another 
thread? I forget) and I was very low level - most of the groups were well 
into their 20s.  I was lucky to get a group the first time, but since the 
aviaks were so red, I wasn't getting many hits in.  I was very grateful 
to the group for taking me in, as they turned away other, higher level 
players to boot.  However the group leader has gone to LOIO, which I have 
no wish to do again, and I haven't seen the other members since.  I've 
tried to LFG there, but the offers don't exactly roll in :)

I was afraid to kill the centaurs!  No bad faction, then?  Well, I guess 
it doesn't matter *anyway*.  No bread quest. :)

Didn't get much exp at LOIO, either.  Either I was in a group who pulled 
one thing every five minutes, or at the mill, where people from other 
groups kept pulling high reds and running around the group yelling until 
they dropped dead, and the red turned on us.  Too bad you can't help the 
mob out sometimes *scowls*

Ah. Forget the above question, then *g*  I seem to recall that *some* 
aviaks conned scowling and *some* conned dubious :/

Exactly.  Now try and tell that to Verant. :)  "No no no don't sell to 
the vendors!  Sell to the *players*!"  "Fine.  Make spiderlings and bats 
drop plat, and I'll do just that."
