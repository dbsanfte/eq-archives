 I guess the days of earning what you have are gone...

 And it's a lot different than buying stuff. When SOE itself is giving
out rare (No Drop) items from tough encounters because of some bullshit
volunteering at a Fan Faire I think that's a bit on the questionable
side myself. 

 A reward for helping? Sure. A reward of that level, arguable one of the
best warrior weapons pre-Time of Plane (guessing there has to be good
loot there)? I call a rat when I see one.
