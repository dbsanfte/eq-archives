Sounds annoying, actually, for those that don't have all expansions, or 
those of us on the Combine where we aren't actually IN expansions past 
DON yet.  I don't know what that last bit means at all.

Those features do sound handy.

This sounds... a little scary.  I can't remember for sure, but it seems 
to me some of those things had a cost per level that went 3 6 9 3 3 3 3 
and so on. Ranks may have changed?  I hope there's at least the same 
effect as I have now, and that there's no increase in the costs for the 
next ranks compared to how they are now.  On the plus side, I agree that 
  there are lines where it seems expansion after expansion it was more 
of the same thing, but with different names; this will make it easier to 
keep track of where I am.

Weird, but I like the idea of seeing the base item instead of having to 
look at item and augment and do the math.  Will make it simpler to 
compare something I'm wearing to a drop to see if its an upgrade, and to 
look at items like quest rewards that people post links to.

Wow, so if you got Triple Attack yesterday, you've got a maxed out skill 
in it today, but if you ding that same level today after the patch, 
you'll be skilling it up from (0)?  sucks to be you!

Rejoice.  Yeah, thats what I do every time a zone is "upgraded" from the 
old standard to a hugely laggy new look with no new mobs or quests, and 
my maps stop working.  Yay.

There's a stunning example.  Ocean of Tears.  Messed up.  Moved to an 
island... well thats a help at least, reduce the area to be searched to 
about 10% of the zone, instead of somewhere at the bottom of the ocean 
with no clue where.

RZTW is the only kill I'm missing for EP access.  I doubt this is good 
news, we're on Combine and trying to stick mostly to the progression, so 
my guild ( and my character) have mostly gear from POP and before... we 
aren't going to take out RZTW with one group.  But some people in the 
three higher Combine guilds are in high end GOD, OOW, and even some DON 
gear.  If they can waltz in there with one or two groups, there's a lot 
more likelyhood he'll be killed before we get to him.

More "gosh this revamping a zone without upgrading it was a lame thing 
to do" evidence.

Well thats good at least, those epic events are tough and its good to 
have some rewards dropping to help encourage people to come assist you 
with them.

That sucks!  As an SK, I get a lot of mileage from lifetap procs, in 
part because I've invested in AA that improve my healing and my DD.  A 
nominal 100 point lifetap proc gets me 200 quite often (one of the two 
critting) and even 400 sometimes (crit nuke, crit heal).  This change 
will both decrease my "regen" and the usefulness of all those AA I 
spent.  Plus, less crit spam, which as we all know on raids is the whole 
goal.

Worded incorrectly I wager, you won't be able to get the OLD quests 
anymore... although I wouldn't put it past SOE to get the actual work 
wrong as well.

OK, what exactly is the point of this?  The recipies have been changed 
to require a different item, but that different item is found right 
where the old one was?

I've never seen the point of this line.  I fizzle very rarely as it is, 
do I really need to pump dozens of AA in to first make fizzling low 
level spells I never cast anyway, and then finally the high level spells 
I do use, fizzle slightly less?

> - Corrected issues with Touch of the Cursed in certain instances.

What does that mean?  I haven't bought the AA yet, the whole "do stuff 
to my Harm Touch" set of AA's are low on my priority list.  But what 
were the issues, and why did you only fix them in certain instances, 
what instances, and what is the change?  So much detail on other patch 
notes, and this one just "guess"

Thats an improvement, in addition to being more consistent, its also 
going to apply to more spells.  Spells people care about well that I 
don't know, haven't been interested in these for my SK yet... I didn't 
even realize they wouldn't work on spells from 3 to 4 sec cast time, 
just assumed they would.  Are there lots of spells on other classes that 
will benefit from this change?

As in "since it didn't go off before you died, we'll pretend you didn't 
use it"?  Could we do that with Discs too?  Sucks to activate Unholy 
Aura and then die before HT.  For that matter, Unholy Aura discipline is 
stupid, shouldn't be a duration thing, should just instantly HT upgraded 
when I click it.  It has no use beyond HT, and there's no way to get HT 
again so quickly that I could use it twice during the UA duration.

> - Buffs will no longer count down while you are in the Guild Lobby.
Huge help.  The introduction a few days ago of the Guild Hall on Combine 
meant that buffers and rezzers no longer hung out in the Lobby, where 
you might be able to tip them for rezzes and buffs; they moved into the 
Guild Hall to preserve their buffs.  Now perhaps they'll move back out 
to the spot where half the dead on the server show up!  Sad news for POK 
though I'd guess... and the Lobby may get a bit crowded.

I hadn't noticed this, if it entered my perception at all I guess I 
assumed it was lag.

> - The /who command should now process quicker.

I had noticed this.  Used to be nearly instantaneous, but recently its 
taken 10 seconds or so on average.  Disconcerting.

No, I just destroyed a couple augments last night and got a destroy box. 
  Maybe SOME of the solvents were displaying the wrong message, but the 
ones I bought, in BB wayfarer camp, didn't.

Less spam for bards, good thing.  Bad news for bard BOTs though, who now 
will have to restart melody after silence ends, instead of just leaving 
it run thru a brief one.  On the other hand, canny bards know that 
picking one song and sticking to it lets you operate during silence. 
Hope this still works.

What?  Mob corpses?  That makes no sense.  My corpse?  Its not lootable 
by others and I don't care what zone its in or if it was moved I don't 
want it lootable by others, and I don't want it not lootable by me.

> - Armor should no longer disappear after using illusions.

Bah, this was a great way to see your enchanter's groupmates in their 
skivvies.  No, really I appreciate this, its weird raiding with a bunch 
of people who look like fresh rolled newbies.

Didn't notice this, sounds odd.  But harmless.

Good, I sometimes get told "invite Boborand" and it turns out they 
misspelled his name (or I have) and he's really Bobborand.  I invite a 
nonexistant player, and then wonder why he's not hitting follow.  Now 
I'll know right away.

Sounds good for those mobs who drop a bunch of items with long names. 
Does present the opportunity for massive spamming though... have they 
considered removing the link all button that shows up when you loot your 
own corpse?

Nice.

What does this mean?  Fraction of a second is... wow thats a huge change 
sounds like.  The difference between an 18 delay and a 10 delay is a 
fraction of a second.  How big was this fraction, and was it in our 
favor or against it?  Why NPC only, did delay work differently in PvP?

Yeah that was annoying.  Good, I hope this works.



Well I guess I'll go do some useful work.  Responding to the patch took
just as much time as I would have spent monkeying around on an alt before
going and making swords anyway.  Down side is, patch will still be going
on when I'm done and ready to play some more!
