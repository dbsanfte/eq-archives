}urk.  exceptions do _not_ prove rules, they disprove them.

Prove has more than one meaning.  In the context above, it is definition 
#2, as opposed to definition #3.

Main Entry: prove  Function: verb
1 archaic : to learn or find out by experience
2 a : to test the truth, validity, or genuineness of <the exception proves 
the rule> <prove a will at probate> b : to test the worth or quality of; 
specifically : to compare against a standard -- sometimes used with up or 
out c : to check the correctness of (as an arithmetic result)
3 a : to establish the existence, truth, or validity of (as by evidence or 
logic) <prove a theorem> <the charges were never proved in court> b : to 
demonstrate as having a particular quality or worth <the vaccine has been 
proven effective after years of tests> <proved herself a great actress>
4 : to show (oneself) to be worthy or capable <eager to prove myself in 
the new job>
                                 
intransitive senses : to turn out 
especially after trial or test <the new drug proved effective>

The original theory behind the expression is that, if someone had to 
make an exception to a rule, that showed that the rule itself had 
validity, since if it did not, they would throw out the whole rule rather 
than refine it with an exception.
