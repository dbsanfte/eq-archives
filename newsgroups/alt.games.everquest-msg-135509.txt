I think only a complete idiot thinks it's a choice, and its beyond me
why you could think your sexuality is NOT a choice, but mine is.  But
ok, lets go with the assumption for a bit...

That's like saying a woman is at fault for being raped if she was
dressed provocatively (or, at least, in a way the court thinks is
provocative).  Or that its ok to steal a car parked in a bad
neighbourhood, or that you deserve to have your wallet stolen if you
dare to walk through a "bad part of town".

So, you oppose so-called "special rights", you think being gay is a
choice, and therefore you think we deserve some of the responsibility
for attacks on gays.  Yeah, you're not a bigot at all.  You just keep
digging yourself in deeper and deeper.

In a perfect world I could ignore you, you could ignore me, and we
each could hold our own views.  Unfortunately its not a perfect world.
I've lost jobs, lost thousands of dollars in tax credits, spent that
much again establishing legal documents to get the same relationship
recognition you have.  I used to deal with the "he's not really your
spouse" issues on everything from plane tickets to gym memberships on
a daily basis.  All this because ignorants like you can't stay out of
things they don't understand.

Some day you may realise the harm you've done.  You should also
apologize to your kids, grand-children, and all other descendents yet
unborn.  Sooner or later one of them will need anti-discrimination
laws, and you helped make that a bit harder for them.
Congratulations.
