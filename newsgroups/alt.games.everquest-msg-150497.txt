If you are in a guild raid on Naggy, that's pretty much what the later game is
like.  If you are in a pickup raid -- life gets MUCH better.

30 minutes.  Generally higher level raids are done by guilds.  There are two
widespread ways of determining loot.  Most common is that a designated person
or officer group simply awards the loot.  Less common is the DKP system, where
you earn points every time you attend a raid and can "spend" those points to
get a particular piece of loot.  Some guilds use a random system, but not too
many at higher levels.

Yes but this can't prevent it.  Believe me, this can always be a problem in
accessible zones, ie someone wandering by and looting the Avatar of War in
Kael, because whoever has it locked has to let go in order to let someone get
their loot.

LD can really cause a mess if the corpse is old.

Usually the raid will ask people in the zone if they want it, or try to get
someone's alt to the zone.

>4. On the uberest of mobs, does anyone even care about what group
>actually gets the xp? How about the cash loot?

Cash loot is ignored.  The xp hit is nice but nobody REALLY worries about it,
since it is going to the rogue or wizard group.

>5. What is the suicide rate of raid loot distribution officers? How

There tends not to be too much complaining in most guilds.  Complaints about
loot awards are a sign that a guild is in trouble.
