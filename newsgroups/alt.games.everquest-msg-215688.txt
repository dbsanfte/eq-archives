The dungeon pops 30 minutes after the adventure is complete, and corpses
pop out at that time. So you'll have to wait 30 minutes before that
rez whore can fix you up, sorry.

You've just added a 30 minute latency to finishing any dungeon where
there is a death.

You can have a paladin do it for you... if you have one. It will only
be a 90% rez, and they'll have to med up for it. Unlike an epic cleric.
Good luck convincing a necro to spend an EE on their 93% rez.

Playing as a cleric, I find 2 things:
- Usually within minutes of putting up my LFG flag I'll get tells
  inviting me to adventure groups.
- A significant majority of druids do not want to be main healer.

The second point is something I'm aware of because in the high levels
main clerics are relatively rare, on my server anyway, and I often wind
up inviting a druid in as a replacement. About half refuse to serve as
a main healer.

As for DPS... usually I'm meleeing when I'm there as healer. If we assume
30DPS (which is the common estimate for cleric melee DPS), matching
the relative efficiency of melee (180 damage per tick for about 15 mana)
is essentially impossible. It's a 12:1 ratio.

(The 15/tick is the difference, approximately, between yaulp VI mana
regen and medding mana regen.)

Of the rest of it - damage shields, get a mage. Resists, clerics can
do resists, but they are rarely necessary in LDoN in my experience.
Pot9 - Virtue has more HP and AC than Pot9, and if the mana regen is
needed, we can get Pot9 from an external druid and whack Symbol on
top of it. Nukes - ours are slightly worse, but that's compensated by
melee output and possession of the best anti-undead nuke in the game.
HP regen, use the shaman you brought along as a slower (and who has
better DPS than the druid because they can regen mana with canni).

Add crowd control - pacification - stuns, via spells and bash - the
Blessing line to reduce casting times - better AC and DA/DB if they get
healing aggro - more mana efficient heals... the druid can't really
compete. The main drawback to the cleric is that healing is often
such a dull (and stressful) job that there aren't really enough of them
around. Which I suspect is why I haven't had any trouble finding a group
since I was in my mid-50s.
