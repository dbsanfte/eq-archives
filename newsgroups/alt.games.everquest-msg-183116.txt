And you know this by reading the code?  Most of these problems have been
around longer than the "new and improved bandwidth friendly graphics".
Traders in the cieling of the bazaar, for one, and ending up in walls, for

friendly graphics"?  Or is this your pathetic attempt to bash Sony for the
stupidity?
