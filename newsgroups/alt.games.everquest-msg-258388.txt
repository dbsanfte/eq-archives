There are lists for many countries and all of the States of the
Union...enjoy the read...

My favorite?  Being in Pennsylvania I would have to say this one:   "It is
illegal to sleep on top of a refrigerator outdoors."

But, staying on topic: "Any motorist who sights a team of horses coming
toward him must pull well off the road, cover his car with a blanket or
canvas that blends with the countryside, and let the horses pass. If the
horses appear skittish, the motorist must take his car apart, piece by
piece, and hide it under the nearest bushes."
