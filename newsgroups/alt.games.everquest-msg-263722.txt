You've done that several times over. If you haven't gotten your point 
accross by now, you probably never will. Ironically you've utterly 
failed to observe the actual dynamics of the conversation:

Annie didn't object that you don't want her to feed trolls; she objected 
that you felt it your place to tell her how to behave.  Then when you 
followed up, rather than recognize that Annie was offended by what you 
said not how you said it, you went on to not only defend how you said it 
(an irrelvant strawman), but reiterated your position that she do what 
you told her, to which of course Annie was further put out.

And of course, subsequent to that you undermined any pretense of not 
wanting to offend by suggesting she learn how to talk to adults.

Surely you can see there has been some considerably folly on your part 
too. Annie no doubt responded to a troll... we've all seen the evidence 
of that. But your efforts to claim the moral high ground are definately 
characterized by 'unhealthy zeal'.

"rabid" is defined, amongst other things, as extremely zealous. And of 
course retains the negative connotations of the disease, implying that 
this zeal is perhaps not a 'good thing'.

That is precisely the correct word.

Since it will evidently make your day, who am I to deny you such a small 
pleasure:

"I know you are, but what am I."
