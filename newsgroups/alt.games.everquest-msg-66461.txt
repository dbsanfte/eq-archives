While we're ranting - where is my "free for knight classes" horse? And
I don't mean "level through 51 six times, level through 55 twelve
times, and then level through 59 five times without actually leveling,
to get the as-yet-undefined 'ultimate' steed", either. 

*Is* there a horse-summoning spell for paladins and/or shadow knights
out there (and if so, where?), or is this just one more thing promised
but not delivered?
