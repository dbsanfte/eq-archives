No! i don't mean "What the hell??" (gotcha). This is yet another pleading
request for advice on 'Where to hunt'.

I duo-box often with a 52nd Dwarf Warrior (Mine) and a 50th Wood Elf Druid
(friends former account). At this point the druid is great at dealing damage
and buffing, but his poor little Greater Heal spell is holding us back.
Often I've taken to leaving the Warrior in the bazaar while soloing the
Druid in the SW corner of EW.
    On an aside let me just add that I rarely ever see anyone mention this
spot as a viable place for a soloing druid, and I don't yet understand why?
The mob selection is varied enough to be challenging; plenty of animals
around if you like charming; plenty of similar monsters around for
quad-kites. A quad of giant savages yields about a blue bubble of XP, plat,
occassional velium weapons, quest components, faction - in short a great
haul!  Are the places that get more mention even better than this?
Anyway, with the druid soloing I hope to have him at 51st by the end of this
week.  So what I'll have to duo-box with is the following:
52nd Dwarf warrior: (1/2 bub from 53rd. Will ding after I finish AA run
speed2)
1127 AC with buffs
2700HP with buffs
Aw, heck, here's his Magelo:

51st woody Druid
215 WIS (240 with KEI)
No Magelo on him, but he doesn't own any clicky stuff

So!  What places would be open to us for XP?  For coin or loot?  From Luclin
on down is open. I'm considering the front part of KC, DS, MAYBE  ME, Kedge,
Burning Woods, and OOT.

Thank you for any input you all may have. May Brell smile on you, and may
Tunare goose you in the fanny.
