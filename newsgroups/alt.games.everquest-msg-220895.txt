Nope. You are "reborn" exactly as you were minus everything that was on 
your body when you died and minus a small amount of experience as a 
penalty proportionate to your level. At that point, you have to return to 
your corpse (sort of a corporeal out of body experience, I suppose) 
without the benefit of any weapons, armor or light sources, and loot your 
own corpse to get all your stuff back.

The good thing is that until level 10, you keep everything on you when 
you die and don't have to go retrieve it. Also, until level 11 there is 
no experience penalty. That gives the new player ample opportunity to 
familiarize themself with the nuances of the game without spending half 
their time on corpse runs.
