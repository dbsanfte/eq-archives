They seem to have a pretty short "follow that bastard who attacked me"
range in the water, so I'd think snare would be a bad idea.  My Wizard
pulls with the right-click effect on my Staff of Temperate Flux (if I
decide to pull instead of fight in the water...see below).  I get the
goblin targeted, and then swim up.  When I get far enough up to see
the surface of the lake, I invoke the right-click effect (aren't items
that work while running or swimming great?), break through the
surface, and run to the shore (jboots active, of course), using the
right-click on the Staff to tell when I'm getting too far ahead, so I
can stop to let the goblin catch up a little.

I've never managed to get two.  I'm level 50, though.  I wonder if
that is high enough that they won't gang up on me?  Or have I just
been lucky.

Lately I've been skipping the pulling part and just fighting in the
lake.  As a Wizard, I've got a big nuke (Ice Comet).  One IC takes
them low enough that they want to run away, so I don't need to root or
snare them.
