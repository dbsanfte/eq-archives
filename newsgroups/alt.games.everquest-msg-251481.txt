Absolutely can't agree with you. I've been playing solo for years. I offer
to group in ldons, but i always inform the person i speak to that it'd be my
first time, and then they suddenly have a full group and can't possibly have
space for me. The fact is, I'm surrounded by people who have no interest in
interacting. They want to powergaming to Time/ GoD and talking just gets in
the way.

I'd like to do a solo/duo dungeon but have a flag lfg: "I want to play a
grouped ldon but haven't done it before" and if I never, ever get a bite
(and i don't think i will), then at least I'll be levelling and getting to
the point where i can explore some of the zones i can only read about.

I am not choosing to solo, but would like solo AT LEAST. :-]
