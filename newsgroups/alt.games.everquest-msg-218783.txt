Also, I'll tell you, I (enchanter) start sweating at about 5, and get really
nervous at about 8 or 9. Most of the time the problem is that with 7+ mobs
I'm not going to have the mana to keep things locked down well until
everything else is killed, unless it's a fast killing group.  My personal
best w/o any deaths was an 11 pull, which my last crowd control efforts were
little level 4 root parks on the last two after running them out, clicking
off horse(to stop quickly,) doing the shadowknight style feigndeath casting
spin, color stun, root, color stun, root, run back, resummon horse. Mind you
we had a dispeller that had axed my kei at some point, and I was slower, so
with a bit more dedication to sole crowd control some of the better
enchanters probably could have done that without a sweat.

It also depends on your grove. Some nights every pull is a five pull, and it
gets boring. Some nights triples start me panicing.
