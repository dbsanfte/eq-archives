Understand and respect?  How about "live for"?  The 
moment you start randomly bombing, you're going to have 
terrorists shoving bombs up your *ass*.  Why?  Because 
those who died deserve vengeance!  Sound familiar?  Kill 
those who did it.  Kill those who planned it.  Punish 
those who harbored them, and let it be known that there 
will be FAR more severe punishments in the future.  But 
hit places where he 'might' be??  Please, don't go that 
far.  It's frightening.  Or if you're going to, maybe 
you'd like to find out where your own little unabomber 
lived and take out his part of the country.  Just to 
make sure.
