to be honest I think sony already is selling items and plat ....I have
browsed the items at playerauctions and have to wonder where the heck one
guy has so many items on EVERY server?????? I hate to think that I it is a
conspiracy BUT after the way sony has handled the 8 expansions and the
pricing for the game and the promotion of the expansions, it would not
surprise me at all that they have all along been selling plat and items for
real money. (heck if I was running sony and my job depended on the
bottom-line...you can bet your arse I would be doing it!)

just my 2cp on that thought
