Winning is fun.

False dichotomy.     There is a happy middle ground where the fights are
challenging and dangerous, without being stupid and careless.

You sound like another monk that I used to know.   He was the worst puller
ever.  He liked to "live on the edge" and pull 8 or 10 mobs every time, even
though the cleric and enchanter were screaming about having zero mana.
Since he could just feign death every time, he had absolutely no concept of
a death penalty, and wasn't bright enough to realize that the rest of the
group / raid were not having fun with the constant wipeouts he provided.

Heh.  And then whined when I insisted on pulling instead of him.   "But I'm
a monk!  Monks pull all the time!"  ...  "Monks pull all the time because
they can get smaller pulls than everyone else.  You don't.   We're safer
with a warrior pulling."
