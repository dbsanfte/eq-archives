After reading the lovely story/description by LANkrypt0 (Newbies fresh
off the CD) yesterday I started working my Taunt on my Bristlebane
Palidin last night. He has just hit level 6 last night (ding). I
noticed that all the fighting I did didn't get me one gain in Taunt. I
was able to hit it at least twice per fight and I leveled from about
half wat up last night in the East Commons.

I set it up as my #2 hot key and just kept hitting it every time it
cycled. Why didn;t I get any gains??? 

In Ultima most of the skill gains now are difficulty based. That means
that unless you are working on progressivly more difficult
creatures/items you do not get gains. Is that the way things tend to
work here in EQ??
