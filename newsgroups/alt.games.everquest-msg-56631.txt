from my own experience

In the middle of a fight "Hey how did that fishing pole get in my hand"

"I don't know, can you look over the edge of The Hole with out falling in?"

"Of course my cleric can solo this blue (insert any monster name here)"

In unrest "Don't worry i'll use my AoE fear spell it works every time"

"Sure, i'll pull Sir Lucan"
