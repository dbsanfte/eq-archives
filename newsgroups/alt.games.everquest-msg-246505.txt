Your quite right Sony's activeX component is likely to be fine.

The trouble isn't Sony using ActiveX. Its activeX in general. If you 
have your PC setup to allow it download ActiveX then you are asking for 
trouble. As a result many users have thoroughly disabled IE and ActiveX 
on their PCs to prevent 'clever' websites from installing them 'for you'.

As an analagy... it would be like Sony sending you an html email with an 
embedded script, an executable attachment, and required you receive it 
and execute it with the freely available outlook express as part of the 
signup process.

Sure that email is probably harmless... but only a complete idiot would 
use outlook express, have it render html, execute scripts, *and* allow 
executable attachments past the virus scanner... and it would take an 
even bigger idiot to think that this was a good process for beta signups.

(Note that using OE isn't the sign of an idiot, its the whole package of 
enabled scripts, no antivirus exe blocking etc... so nobody get offended 
if they use OE)

(Note also that OE does suck though. Try Mozilla or Thunderbird if your 
looking for a better free email client.:)
