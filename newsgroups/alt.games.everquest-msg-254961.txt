Not saying they had to do 20K individual things, it could be some sort of 
GM event. Like rescue princess Fiona locked in the highest room in the 
highest tower, this could be some quest that requires a group or raid, and 
then the competition would start to be one of the first to rescue Fiona, 
and get some loot either nice or some character flag. But the quest would 
be something unique.

Or something like the old UO, do a quest from the messageboard and the Town 
Crier would announce the news of your success, if we had town criers in EQ.

But hey, why spray this now, it is already coming in EQII or something 
alike this.
