 Only spent 6 or 7 months straight on EQ1. Got screwed over by a GM
and sent a complaint into soe. I won't be renewing until; I get
satisfction, which translates into I'm through with EQ anything.

 I'm guessing EQ1 will be dropped soon due to some lame excuse as
'Can't advanced the technology enough to compete with the current line
of MMORPG' (aka the reasons they dropped DirectX 8.x support and
forced everyone to upgrade) added with "But our new EQ2 is better than
EQ1 in so many ways". Why stick around?

 Unless they want to alienate their current huge player base in the
event my previous statement comes true they had better.

 Withdrawl. Been EQ1 free for 1 week already and only feeling the
slightest twitch.
