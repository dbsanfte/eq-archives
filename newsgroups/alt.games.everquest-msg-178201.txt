Light Years Of Love
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

( - J. Bouchard - H. Wheels - )

When we met it was a white hot star
The speed of light between two hearts
It felt like love, it sounds bizarre
But in your eyes I could see so far

Baby baby shouldn't know no fear
Was it an angel who brought us here
Old old songs, but the love goes on
Changing life into a song

It took light years, light years of love
Light years, light years of love
Of love, of love

Our love is like the shining sea
In salty foam, we can feel so free
Caress the night with our cool skin
In your arms I can be anything

We've got light years, light years of love
Light years, light years of love
Of love, of love

Repeat
