Having received my warrens hunting guide here, I have been hunting there
<G>

Post patch it seems to me that it is easier to hunt there.
The mobs seem to run less / later and go down quicker.

Of course I could be imagining it.
Plus I got 8th last night which makes a big difference for my necro.
However for the last yellow and a half of 7th everything went much
smother than previously.

So any one else noticed this ?

Seems to me that one of the problems with the warrens was that mobs
would run and then bring on a mighty train. This happened much less last
night. Could make the zone more popular for lowbies.


I made a full level of xp last night from 7.7 to 8.8 and only died once.
This is so much better than the rest of level 7 where I died like 8
times.

Cheers,

Jim
