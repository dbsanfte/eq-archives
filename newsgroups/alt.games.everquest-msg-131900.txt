And this was my main point. People who started as druids for the most part
leave the profession or leave eq. Druids are so imbalanced that the choices
come down to quit eq, accept your place as a complete nobody , or change
classes and do everything over again with a bit more knowledge.

Druids now are suffering every bit as much as the semis where a year ago .
They have bumped the effectiveness of the semis so many times to try and
reach balance it isnt even funny. Eq never understood the diffrence between
a general practioner and a speciality brain surgeon. Either one will
diagnose a general problem fairly well .

A nuclear engineer can indeed change a tire. A gourmet chef can cook a
burger. Your friendly It at your isp can hook up your cable tv.

On the eq side there are 15 classes and 3 are designated as healers. Only
one can heal in any situation that matters for most of us.
