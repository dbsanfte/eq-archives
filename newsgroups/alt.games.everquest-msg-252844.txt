I definitely agree with you here.  But something else that I get very
annoyed about is when perfectly capable groups will not kill what they
*could* be killing.  For example, these days it seems there is no one
camping the courtyard in PoD, the Goblins in PoN, the factory in PoI,
or the tunnels in PoJ.  Yet if I put up LFG from level 53 or 54
through level 60, I will get plenty of tells for groups at the
entrance in PoI, the waterfall in PoN, the exits in PoJ, etc...  These
people will have everything they need to kill much higher level mobs
and double or triple their exp-per-hour but they would rather play it
safe or they are lazy or they have never fought those tougher mobs
before.
