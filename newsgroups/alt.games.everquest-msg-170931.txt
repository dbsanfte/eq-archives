A quick question...where did you pick up the Springwood Club?  Did you
buy it in the Bazaar, or was it a drop?  I'm using a Centi Warhammer
right now solely for the WIS (a measly +2).  The S.C. would be MUCH
better for me.

Once I get my Magelo profile working correctly (grr...), I may have to
ask everyone for opinions.  I'm relatively happy where I am right now,
focusing on WIS (192), but other perspectives would be useful.
