Can I explain something to you? A long long time ago in this very newsgroup
a father posted about how his son was suffering from clinical depression
after having his EQ name changed from Ytwok<Year 2000> to something a little
more appropriate.

At that time the same exact debate took place with me being the only one
that diverged from the theme of the thread. I posted that if his kid was
that mentally crippled by having his named changed that the real issue
should be he getting some profesional help rather then playing EQ.

Now I am wondering just who has a problem. If Verant said "Cortese, your
character's name will be Shirley Temple" I would just kind of blow it off
with a "Who gives a fuck?"

I mean this is not one of lifes major decisions like "Shall I go to college
or join the army?" It is a petty little trivial thing that most normal
people could give a shit about. I would prefer not to be known in EQ as
Buutt Fugger, but if it was a troll or an ogre and mandated by VI, OK by me.

Now here we have this tiny little insignificant naming rule that nobody
*normal* really gives a shit about. What purpose does it serve? Well, it
identifies the social retards and mentally disturbed before they even start
playing the game.

So ask yourself "Do I give a shit about the ability to name my character
something stupid?" I mean is it really important to have that option, like
it is a game breaker for you? If it is, you probably need some professional
help.

I believe what you are doing is known as "A Defensive Facade". You are
trying to position yourself as liberal with your post here, when in truth
you are both inflexible and incapable of acting any other way.
