WOOT!

In my old guild apps were public knowledge. If the applicant was
already in a guild, we would talk to the old guild. I have never
thought that people jumping ship on the sly was a good thing.

If they wanted to join us after they left their own guild thats
different.

What is with the super secret guild membership thing? I know one guild
who removed all their members from guild magic so it would be
confidential.
