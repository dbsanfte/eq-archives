Hey, I used to go to Va Tech.  Fair warning, I knew a couple people in the
Architecture college and they had little time for anything except school.
Fairly rough, but highly rewarding, curriculum.

Oh, and there is an abundance of amazingly beautiful girls there.

Check out Boudreax's restaurant sometime.  AWESOME cajun food.

Also the Blacksburg Crawl is fun.  Start at Top of the Stairs, go down the
street, hang a left and go to Bogan's, then The Hokie House and on down the
line, grabbing a couple drinks at each.  Then stumble home.  Great fun until
the next morning.

God I miss that town.
