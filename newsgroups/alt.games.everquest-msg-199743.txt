Two other classes come to mind in that regard.  In my previous guild, we 
had to cancel two hate raids, or recruit outside help due to a lack of a 
wizard, and we had to recruit a rogue for CoM.  I believe we also ended up 
cancelling one due to a lack of an FD puller (monk or SK would have done in 
that case, necro would have been to fragile).

Last raid I went on, we should have cancelled due to a lack of clerics, but 
it was fun.  Took 10 people to UP to try the Swarmcaller.  Only one cleric 
was there, level 49, botted by the MA, a 56 warrior.  We actually did 
fairly well, but had not researched the cycle enough, we ended up with nine 
mobs including the Swarmlord? some other named mob, and seven of the normal 
pops for the waves.  We ended up wiping at that point, after the cleric, 
and the druid went down, leaving just me as a healer, well, ok, two rangers  
as well.  I was already LoM from slowing the waves of mobs.  We did have a 
blast though, and, in the end, that's what counts.
