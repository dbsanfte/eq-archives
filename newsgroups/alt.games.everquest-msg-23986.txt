Another sucker hooked.  Verant rejoices. :)

A couple notes, but the most important first:

DO NOT GIVE ANY ITEMS OR MONEY TO BEGGARS.  A beggar is anyone you  don't
know, usually level 1 - 5.   If it were allowed, the proper response would
be "Fuck off.  Earn it yourself, asshole," but that isn't allowed, so just
ignore them...they're used to it.

Money is tight until the upper teens.  I mostly worked on saving for my
level 19 spells (do research for how much that's going to require) then on
upgrading my equipment.

>>Comments I'd read about rampant cheating, PvP problems
and overpopulated servers had turned me off the whole idea.<<

I have no clue what you're talking about here.  What cheating?  What PvP
problems?  And overpopulation really isn't a problem anymore.
UNDERpopulation is more likely (unless you do the zones everyone else does;
Oasis, South Karanas, Lake of Ill Omen).
