I tried Vanguard briefly and found that most of the innovations set to
distinguish it from EQ were just ... not impressive. So i returned to
EQ. But then i tried EQ2, and i think all sony really did was remove
all the things people complained about from EQ1 (corpse runs, looking
for a group, and anything "serious" or "tedious," depending on your
perspective). And it looks fantastic. I also think it's nice to be
around the familiar - lore of Al'Kabor, the music in kelethin, and the
idea of twists on original EQ (which i resisted at first). I'd
recommend trading in vanguard for EQ2 (both are $39.99 at most
retailers), assuming you haven't opened it. For a long time (7yr) EQ
player, EQ2 seems to be new-enough to work. Sorry i i'm gushing.
