You *can* twist 2 songs with 1 hotkey.

/pause 3, /stopsong
/pause 35, /cast 1
/pause 3, /stopsong
/cast 2


Will issue the /stopsong command, wait 3/10ths of a second, start
the song in slot 1, wait 3.5 seconds, issue the stopsong command,
wait .3 seconds, then start the song in slot 2.

This reduces button presses to 1 per 7.8 seconds (approx).

HOWEVER

This is not a good idea.  It locks you into those 2 songs for the
next 8 seconds and gives you no ability to recover from missed notes 

Better is - 

/pause 3, /stopsong
/cast #

make one for each song you want to twist, with # being the spell gem
number.

Then twisting songs 1, 2 and 3 is:
press hotkey 1
immediately move your finger to the next song key but don't press it -
this takes care of the problem of forgetting where you were in your
twist.
When you see the sparklies (or the cast bar go away, or in my case,
EQWatcher makes a small noise) press the next key
again, move your finger immediately to the next key.

You will be able to maintain 3 songs with just a little practice.
