There is good evidence that Wicca pre-dates Gardner. He claimed to
have learned the tradition from one Dorothy Clutterbuck, in 1939, who
was a member of the New Forest coven.

Doreen Valiente, a High Priestess in Gardner's coven, did considerable
research into Dorothy, and found proof that Dorothy was in fact a real
person. See Appendix A of "A Witches' Bible" by J. and S. Farrar for
details.

It seems highly likely that though Gardner may have coined the term
"Wicca", he did actually learn the tradition from someone else, and
didn't invent it (as some of his critics have claimed).

That, of course, doesn't mean that Wicca can be traced in an unbroken
line to an ancient religion, but certainly it wasn't invented
wholesale in 1950.

The above source is the best documentation of pre-1950 Wicca that I've
yet found, and it can't reasonably be said to go back further than
1880.
