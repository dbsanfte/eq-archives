This is what happens to me. When I am in bazaar trader mode I drop to
desktop when I am not moving or doing any actions. It only happens in bazaar
and only happens when I am not moving. I have the latest direct x and video
drivers. I have no idea why this is happening. Just stating the facts, if
anyone comes across a fix I will be extremely happy.
Yes I have bugged and petitioned but no responce as yet. I haven't
complained about this before as I thought I was the only one having a
problem.
I'm not an expert on computers, my assumption is that it is something to do
with bandwidth priorites, but thats just a guess.

Cheers
