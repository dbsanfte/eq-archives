I don't think it's a problem at all.  Any *perceived* problem is social
rather than mechanical and thus has no possible solution that can be
implemented through mechanical changes to the game whatsoever.  The "uber
guilds" wouldn't regularly group with the career grinders no matter what the
gap.

Must be nice.  I don't get group offers much in spite of being a 500 dps
monk.  Wish I had something groups wanted beyond raw dps, like a decent
snare...  =P

Well hell, then let's compare DoN gear to NToV gear.  Obviously single-group
gear stomps all over raid-acquired gear.  =)

It'd only be 6 creators for me.  3-boxing is nice.  =)  Regardless, 18 is
quite possible starting Friday afternoon and *lazily* doing them to Sunday
evening.  If you don't move quite that fast, call it two weekends and it
doesn't really change anything.

With time consumed by raiding, and a 6-month cycle on expansions, it might
as well be infinite for all but the hardest of the hardcore.

Yeah...  so?  It's good enough to be equivalent for most purposes.  You want
the extras, raid.  I personally think it's a bit too close to a "required"
raiding progression step, and with the next expansion I expect that opinion
to get stronger.  It's already silly for a raiding guild to even bother with
Velious/Luclin raid encounters, and if people had the option to jump
straight into Time without bothering with anything below that in PoP they
most definitely could and would.  I think obsoleting Time as a required
point in progression is a terrible thing, mostly from the perspective of
considering it one of the best raiding zones in the game.

Planning is not the sole realm and responsibility of raiders.  If it is, all
the more reason to not be concerned about the gaps that result.

SK is actually *fantastic* in the Fear trial.  Snare *and* fear, on
anything, make your only downside be a lack of DPS.

I'd gladly take a DoN-geared tank to Yxxta.  Again, anyplace I can 2-box
without slow is someplace a DoN-geared group can handle without any worry.

But your "experiment" is loaded.  I couldn't get a group of Anguish-geared
guildmates to go to Yxxta.  GoD grinding sucks, or at least it used to and
people don't get over first impressions easily.  Now, if I worked to find
five like-minded people, i.e., "planned things"...

When you impose, or have imposed, the limitation of not being able to raid,
and then further don't bother to work within your limitations to the best of
your ability, you're lazy, or a puss.  I'm not "attacking the man", I'm
ridiculing the mindset.  =)

I've watched it rot several times...  and I truly don't grind much.  Seen

Ask a monk in your guild about the pouch.  That's all you need to say, "the
pouch".  Rare is part of the game.

It's not something to factor in.  Of course there will be upgrades gotten by
a guild while working their way toward Time.  Of course there will be
upgrades acquired by single-groupers working their way through the 400
missions it would take (estimated using your above figure) to get fully
equipped.  Progression, as much as it does seem to come in spurts for me
personally, is a long haul.

Per 6-man group involved?  Maybe enough to match the speed of DoN equipping.

Any color of herring spotted was purely the result of you over-emphasizing a
statement that was not nearly as important to the actual topic as you wanted
to infer that I intended it to be.

I have my own opinion of why they don't allow that, and it has nothing to do
with any sort of balance other than the one at the bank.

A Velious-equivalent geared enchanter is basically soloing the entrance of
Vxed/Tipt.  In other words, any level 70 enchanter you find in the game
should be able to do so as well.  I.E., it's *not* hard to get access to KT.

"Regardless of my gear level" meaning it is an irrelevant factor.  I'm well
equipped.  Not the best in the game by far, but there's little doubt that I
tank better than you do.  That's the point of comparison.  If I can 2-box
something, without slow, than any "reasonably" equipped group, that isn't
out of their "place" (i.e., trying to do RS with the same gear they were
wearing for their entire grind from 55 to 70 in BoT), should be able to
handle it without issue.

It was stated by Sony as being aimed at raid-level monks.  It really didn't
impact raiding monks all that much, because most of us only tanked in our
off-raid-time at best.  Whether you think Sony was lying, or stupid, is
entirely up to you.  I have my own opinion.  =)

You weight gear strangely.  AC, unless you are starting out completely
bereft, isn't nearly as important, even for a tank, as raw hitpoints.  That
applies doubly so when talking about high atk mobs such as those found in
GoD/OoW that can make AC improvements nearly meaningless.

The shielding is nice.  For that alone, which will prevent far more damage
over time than the item's AC, it is a good item for a tank.  It's a
double-edged sword, as later on you'll be looking at items that make it look
sad, but don't have the shielding.  I face that with my haste item
constantly, and always have.  =)
