And that was so obvious from your post.  Personally, I always ask people
what buffs they want.  I do take care of the slowing, sometimes I am the
main healer, sometimes I also am the haster.  It all depends on the group.
If people ask for useless buffs, I usually give them to them, but I do
explain that I can't keep all the buffs going if they want me to be the
healer too, that usually stops that nonsense.
