Hmmm... got too zealous with cut-n-paste.

There was supposed to be a comment about the fact that most people agree 
we have a right to life. But that by itself justifies murdering a 
healthy innocent man to save 2 others. (The right of 2 to live surely 
exceeds the right of 1 to live.) Yet we tend to find that practice 
distasteful and "wrong", it takes a beleif in a 'do not kill' ideal to 
explain why most of us are unfortable with pure utilitarian 
right-to-life scenarios.
