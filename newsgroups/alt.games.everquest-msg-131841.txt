I had the obviously incorrect impression that there was
a number of mobs limit  to stun.

I do think Mez was used while the waves of mobs were
coming in, though.  Stun start just before nukes do, I bet.
This would mean fewer chances for resists perhaps.  Or
you could stack stun with mez to reduce consequences
of stun resist or mez break early.  We did have two
chanters working so this was a belt and suspenders group
anyway.

hmm, does Stun Command have no mob count limit?  I have
two AOE stuns, maybe with.. hmm three clerics, we
could lose the chanters entirely?  Each cleric drops an
AOE stun at intervals so mobs are continuously under
the umbrella till first cleric's first stun finally comes back up.

Fortunately clerics have to perfect this sort of rotation
timing for CH chains, so a stun chain should be just
a matter of fine tuning the skills to the new venue
