By "small armor", do you mean small banded or small plate? The two types require
totally different molds; make certain you get what you need.

For anything tradeskill, I recommend EQTraders (http://www.eqtraders.com) They
maintain a list of all known smithing supplies at
http://www.eqtraders.com/location/smithing.htm. Note that a "X mold" is used for
*medium*; make sure you get a "small X mold" for small sized items and a "large
X mold" if you are smithing for those with a more ample frame.

That said, Neriak is closest to Freeport and has both banded and plate, but as a
barbarian, you are going to be dubious if not kill on sight. You will either
need to have a friend pick up the molds, create a DE merchant mule, or head
elsewhere (small banded molds can be found in Butcherblock, Steamfont and Misty
Thicket; small plate molds in Kaladim.)

We Americans do not have a right to oversee
our leaders, to demand upfront accountability
of their actions and to question their every
decision; this is the moral imperative and
duty of every citizen.
