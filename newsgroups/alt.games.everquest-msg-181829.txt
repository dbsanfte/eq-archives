Level affects scribe/mem independently of (i.e. in addition to) Meditate
skill.  With a WIS caster, who doesn't get Meditate until L8, you can
notice the level effect on scribe/mem times pretty easily as you level
from 1 to 7 (assuming you actually play those levels instead of just
PLing thru them in 15 minutes).  It's not as obvious after you get
Meditate, but with my Paladin I noticed a definite shortening of mem
times for my L39 spells between L39 (Paladin pre-51 cap on Meditate
skill is 185, same as level cap at L36) and L50.
