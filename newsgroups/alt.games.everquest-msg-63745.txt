Ok.  Granted I phrased that incorrectly. :)

I am not sure what level you are, but as a level 36 druid, I get 7 mana per
wisdom point.  Rather makes moonstone rings obsolete at that point.  At
level 30, you have reached the break-even point with moonstone rings vs.
+6wis rings.  Of course, now there are the +7wis rings, so if you spend
enough time porting, you can easily pick up a pair of those by level 30
instead.

As for crafting, since the +str obviously is of assistance (I dont craft &
might not ever), then just keep the moonstone rings in the bank for when you
work on your crafting.  I am not real up on +str finger items as I dont have
any melee types yet, so I dont know if there are worthwhile alternatives to
moonstone rings.
