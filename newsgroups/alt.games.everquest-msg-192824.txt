Don't forget Paladins

Yesterday, I (58 non-ubered ranger) tanked RCY in the Plane of
Disease.  That means PoP mobs, hitting for 350 IIRC, at around level
56-58.  But it gets better.  We had a druid as our main healer, no
cleric and we had 5 people.  Is this the ideal group?  Of course not. 
In fact we only did it because our SK was effectively LD.  (feigned in
the middle of lots of baddies)  But with the right help, rangers and
monks *can* tank.  In fact they may be superior tanks because they get
superior aggro.  What happens when you have 3 healers, all perpetually
FM but your tank can't get aggro fast enough?  That is certainly *not*
ideal.

-Beastlords, enchanters, shaman, bards, and rangers (procs) can all
slow.
-Druids, Shaman, and Clerics can all act as main healers.
-Warriors, SKs, Paladins, Monks, and even Rangers can tank.
-Enchanters and bards can mez, but anyone that can root can ghetto mez
anywhere there is room.

It all depends on the situation.  Take a look at Karnor's.  Want to
take a group to the left courtyard?  Better have a mezzer.  Want to
take them to the right courtyard?  No problem, anyone that can root
can do croud control.

Yes the classic group has a warrior/SK/Paladin as main tank, a cleric
as healer, and a shaman as slower.  For the highest level MOBs
(compared with group level), this is the only solution.  For large
raids, you better have lots of clerics and some good "real" tanks. 
But 90% of the time you can get away with something else.  And given
how boring some people find the "holy trinity" classes, sometimes you
have to be able to get away with something else.
