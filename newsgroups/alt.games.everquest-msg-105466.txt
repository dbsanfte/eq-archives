If you have Luclin, drop by the Netherbian Lair and ask to purchase a
Netherbian Unguis (sp?). Nice damage ratio, pretty quick and can hit magic
creatures. They are lore so groups hunting them there would sell for peanuts
as quite a few would get left to rot.

In Gfay and EC people ask for ridiculous prices for the simplest piece of
Luclin pack filler - definately worth going to the source.
