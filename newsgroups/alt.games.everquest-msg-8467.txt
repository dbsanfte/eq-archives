No, I haven't. The impression I'd got was that it was for very high level
characters (50+), and that most of the more interesting areas could only be
explored in relative safety with the help of several cooperating groups. At
this moment in time I don't have any characters over lvl 50 (nowhere near
50, to be frank), and being part of a large group going on an extended
"raid" really isn't where my interests lie.

What sort of improvements does Velious incorporate? You have piqued my
curiosity.

To put it mildly, Verant's positions are not of any great importance to me.
I pay them for their service, and I do not interfere with their hardware or
anything running on it. I also try to be an asset to my fellow players, and
to be a good and honorable player myself.

I have no doubt that a third-party program could potentially be used in ways
that I'd consider "cheating". That doesn't mean they can't useful for
non-cheating purposes. Also, I am one of those weird sorts who likes to know
how something works even if they don't intend to use it. When I was a kid,
for example, I read everything I could about nitroglycerine after watching a
John Wayne movie where they used it to blow up a bridge. I'd never actually
*make* it -- that's just stupid. But I like knowing how. (Of course, these
days such intellectual curiosity will get you thrown out of school or
arrested. Ah, these enlightened times we live in....)

Same deal with some kind of verboten software: I may very well install it
and see how (or even if) it works, but that doesn't mean I'd actually use
it. I know that I may crash my computer or infect it with a virus by being
so curious. I can accept that, and I know how to fix things on my machines
if I break them. As long as I'm not hurting anyone else or cheating in the
game, I see no harm in indulging my curiosity.

Split personality? I contain mutlitudes....

But seriously, it's probably just that I am looking at this from a different
perspective than you expected. My admitted prickliness of manner aside, I do
try to be a just and honorable person. However, this does not preclude
knowing *how* dishonorable things can be done. I love gangster movies and
Frank Sinatra, but you won't find me starting a protection racket. ;)
