True the Qeynos newbie area is pretty lame, but the sewers are another
matter altogether.  Depending on what level you are, the Qeynos sewers are
great exp and a wonderful hunting ground.  Very few MOBs in this zone will
aggro or gang up, making it very easy to solo.  I hit this zone at about 8th
level and made 10th in no time.  At 10th level start camping the thugs-they
are easy pickings.  This zone is almost always empty-you will never have to
fight over a camp, or get trained. (this is a big plus-I got killed twice by
the same train in Paludal this weekend-grrrr)

Gfay on the other hand is very crowded.  There is no necro guild nearby and
you will not be able to go to the bank. The orcs there are very aggressive
and if you get into trouble you cannot run to the guards for help.
