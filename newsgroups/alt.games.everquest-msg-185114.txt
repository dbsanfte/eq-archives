Speaking of these fucktards, is there a way to have XNews =automatically= 
ignore branches of threads that include non-productive people posting in 
them?

Example:

Thread started by A
    Reply by B
        Reply by A
            Reply by B
            Reply by C
    Standard worthless reply by D
        Reply by E showing D what an idiot they are
            Standard worthless reply by D
                Another reply by E showing what an idiot D is
                    ad naseum...

In this example, I would want C to be plonked along with anything below 
their posts in the threads, but don't want the kill the whole thread.

Thanks.
