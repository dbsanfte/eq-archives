For most all zones there is a mob table of some sort where there are several
different types of mobs that can spawn. So killing just one type of mob it
will eventually go extinct and the zone is over run by another type. A zone
repop is done by the GM staff usually when something is wrong like vendors
out of place and all NPCs and Pets are despawned and new ones repop in the
correct spots.
