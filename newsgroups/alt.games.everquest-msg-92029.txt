I helped our Bard camp the RBF for some time because I was bored.  The 
squire or whatever it was that has it popped 3 times, no fork.  He found 
one in EC for an insanely low price, so he ended up buying it.  I swing by 
there whenever I'm in Guk, but never see him.

We'll most likely have our normal group, so I think we should be able to do 
it, as long as the 52 Bard is there.  Thanks.
