Endless parades of "woe is me" from enchanters. If you want a real trade
skill, go pick up tinkering or alchemy. Or tailoring as a class without the
ability to track...the cost isn't there, but the difficulty sure is.

For the same price as getting 1 shaman to 170 alchemy (which is the
absolute maximum possible, and requires that I also get this character to
level 58), I can make 5 L1 enchanters, and get them *all* to 250
jewelcraft.
