Ok I'm a 20th lev druid.I hear about these low lev armor quests, could only
find info on rogue armor but assumed would be similar for druid except
having plusses in wis and dex, I find the quest in sure fall proceed to do
the quest have all the pieces for the leggings except for the giant field
rat fur .spend hours and hours killing giant field rats then it hits me
"could these be lore items?" I had killed like 20 or so one should have
dropped by now.Ask around...yup they are,Damn so I start a ranger get him up
to 5th which takes all weekend.When someone /tells me he can give me
one,which is all I need,so I accept.So I drop it, switch toons, grab it,
drop it in the box, hit combine then blammo leggings.... finally.Put them
on....WTF!!!!!!!!(Oh did I mention I'm a halfling).Only humans and half
elves,what's this bullshit!So I figure ok gotta go to my home town and find
the quest there.I arrive, get the box, and the recipe, go out and start over
again.The area is over run with toons fighting over the same two drops.It
takes all day. Finally at 2am get the last piece, drop it in the box, hit
combine, blammo got leggings put them on......GODDAMNITTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!
RANGER ARMORRR WHY DO THEY HAVE A FUCKING RANGER IN THE FUCKING DRUIDDDDD
GUILDDDD!!!
I take a deep breath and I destroy the two sets of useless leggings.I walk
over to the druid get the beginning of the armor quest.go  to the guy who
has the recipe ask for the moss toe leggings and...nothing... its broken.I
shake my head I should have seen that coming.Sit, log, and with this tale
vent.I don't even want to think of all the ep I could have got doing
something else since all the mobs I needed were green to me.
