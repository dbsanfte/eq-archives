If you look back to my original post that sent this thread spinning in
this direction you'll note that my specific comment went directly to the
use of guards.  It was a caution to be careful in how you use the
guards, not other mobs.  The rationalization that using the guards as
pets rather than killing them is better was a nice touch though <g>.

So why not find ways to do those things with your cleric rather than
with a guard pet?  I do play a cleric and while soloing isn't very
productive in the upper 50s it is highly amusing to see what you can do
with your non healing tools.  I applaud those who are willing to walk
their own path and find tactics others might not have considered, but
just because a tactic is novel or even successful doesn't mean it's
valid.

If you really are that interested in exploring unique tactics I might
suggest you create a new character and handicap him.  Rather than
creating prime race/class combo and then twinking, create a mismatched
race/class, distribute his stat points poorly and let him buy cloth or
leather.  Now you will see how creative you can get with your tactics
hehe.  I ran a half elf druid with sub 100 wisdom into his 40s.  That
boy knew how to use what little he had for maximum effect.  Even in his
50s I've only bumped him up to 140 or so and that's mostly from cast off
cleric gear that got upgraded.  Let's just say he doesn't quad kite
hehe.

But really, all I was doing Lance was telling you to be careful so you
didn't get into trouble.  It's not like there is any game integrity left
to protect in EQ, though there are principles involved I feel strongly
about obviously.
