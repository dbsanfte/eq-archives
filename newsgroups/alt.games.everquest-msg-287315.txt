I'm glad to hear you found something you enjoy.  I'm curious about the
good/evil divide in EQ2.  I understand that the classes branch apart,
so a "good" enchanter has different abilities than an "evil"
enchanter, for example.  I also understand that the "good" and "evil"
characters have different home cities (Qeynos vs. Freeport).

How deep does the divide go?  By choosing "evil", how much have you
been alienated from "good" players?  Do you have common quests?  For
example, in World of Warcraft, the Alliance (humans, dwarves, etc.)
and Horde (orcs, trolls, etc.) are totally unable to group together or
even communicate.  If I roll a human in WoW, and my friend rolls a
troll, for all practical purposes, we may as well be on different
servers.  How much does this exist in EQ2?
