I am going for Page 25 of my epic and I seem to have a problem with finding
the place holder of the Eldrig the Old in Skyfire.  I went to Eqdiva and
read the walkthrough but after a few hours of my casting the bards song of
the Highsung lvl 56.. i can't seem to find the right one....  Now my
question is does the Place holder follow the same path of Eldrig the Old
would or does it have its own brain and goes where ever he wants.  Any
further help would be much appreicated.  Thanks so much
J
