*ahem*

I would just like to point out that Canada does try and 
do it's part during disasters.  You do know how much 
we're trying to do for you guys, right?  *I*, for one, 
don't think the US should be held solely responsible for 
everyone.

And as regards doing their part, I'm unsure what you 
mean - in disasters before this, I *have* seen many 
nations come together to try and help - in this 
disaster, I am unsure how else we (the world) *can* help 
more than we already have.

I just heard that 6 firefighters were found alive in an 
SUV buried under the rubble.  Thank God!  At least I can 
go to work with some *good* news today.
