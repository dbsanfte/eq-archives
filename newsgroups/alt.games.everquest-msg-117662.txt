Newbie human armor quests in Freeport akin to the ones added for Dark
Elves in Neriak, Gnomes in Ak'anon, and Halflings in RV.

As for the orc weaponsmiths, they've been around since day 1, far's I
know. At least as long as I've been playing anyway, and it's been over
2 years... They're for a rather crappy quest that gives a rather
crappy reward.
