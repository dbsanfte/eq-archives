I used to travel back and forth a whole bunch through Nek on my way to
lavastorm, Najena, Sol Ro, Sol A, and later Naggy. Never really bothered
much with invis or such, and didnt' want to pull trains of guards, so I
usually just killed any that jumped me. Later on, I still killed the
ones who *didn't* jump me, just on principle.

Yeah, I guess I could have made Ally that way.
