I have no specific monk advice, but yes, to get your disciplines working 
you now need to buy, or in some cases loot, tomes, which you then hand 
in to your guildmaster to get the disc.  Then you open up a 
disciplines/abilities box by hitting alt C, and click on the S button to 
set up skill hotkeys.

The alt C box gives you 8 spaces, and shows you a timer running down on 
any active discipline.  I'm not sure how you access those spaces other 
than by clicking on them, I'm afraid I'm a hard core click on stuff 
addict and pay no attention to all the various alt control finger on the 
side of the nose stuff that lets you use the keyboard

You can also drag the hotkeys you create to your normal hotkey registers.

Most melee disciplines can be had in the POK library, go straight in and 
take a left, they are on the main floor where you come in.  There are a 
few tomes I use as a berserker that I have to buy from the Monk vendor 
for some reason, so you might look around at the other vendors  to see 
if they have anything you can use.

There are also some new disciplines that came out since you last played, 
I think, such as a level one disc which lets you "throw stones", a 1 
damage range 50 which you can use to pull with and never run out of ammo.

I've heard of a monk Lull that probably works along those same lines, 
but have no details.

I think most melee classes get Focussed Will, which increases your heal 
rate while in effect, lasts a minute and can only be reused every 5 
minutes; its something incredibly tiny like 3 hp per tic and doesn't get 
replaced by a better one (for berserkers at least) until around level 63.

What other new disciplines you may have I wouldn't know, since I can't 
tell a new one from an old one when shopping at the vendors.

Its also possible that you may find you have to go to some out of the 
way spot in order to buy one or another disc; I had to go to EC tunnel 
for one, for example.

And some may be drop only; my latest throwing axe (and all my future 
ones) drops off a mob in Namimbi (or whatever that zone is called), I 
was able to buy it for a whopping 5pp in the bazaar though;I guess its a 
common enough drop and berserker is a rare enough class that it wasn't 
hard to come by and wasn't getting snapped up at the rates suggested on 
berserker web sites, apparantly people were paying upwards of 1000pp for 
this a while ago.
