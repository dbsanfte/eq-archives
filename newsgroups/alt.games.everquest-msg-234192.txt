It's pretty much a given that any spot that fit all of the criteria
you just described would be camped 24/7 and so crowded that you'd be
fighting 50 other people for spawns. 

In EQ, you basically have 2 ways of making serious plat. First (and
easiest) is to farm tradeskill components to sell. Second would be to
hit the dungeons that drop good loot for selling, places like Chardok
(A+B), Droga, Veksar... but you won't be camping those solo at 55.
