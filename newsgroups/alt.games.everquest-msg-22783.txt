You've probably not spent much time in dungeons then.   SoW can only be cast
in an "outdoor" zone.   Dungeons more and more are tending towards indoors
areas at higher levels, while most of the lower level dungeons are still
"outdoors".   Also, some mobs run faster than SoW, (and/or cast it on
themselves) although they tend to be rare.   A particularly nasty case of this
is Guk, where the shaman frogs cast SoW on themselves and others, yet you
cannot cast it since it is indoors.  Gate is your reliable escape method here.

Gate is a very low circle spell, so between that and a high channeling skill,
you can generally get this off even when being beat on by multiple enemies.
Provided you survive long enough.   My own personal best was gating my friends
level 40 druid out of Mistmoore while being attacked by not less than 7 blue
things. Good thing too, she would have killed me if I'd died. ; )

Seems to me that about the only thing that can interrupt a gate once you're
mid to high level is a successful stun.  Or death.  (although I might be wrong
about that, my own casters are still getting up there.)
