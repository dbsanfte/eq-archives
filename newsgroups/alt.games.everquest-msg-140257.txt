My level 9 ranger is currently wearing a shissar scale headband for the head
slot for the no graphics look too. From memory it is 12ac but 15(?) agi
makes up for some extra AC plus it has a good swag of poison resist too -
again 15 from memory and 25hp. I payed 1k on Stormhammer (high prices).

Being the first character I have majorly twinked from birth, the best item
she has is definately her Iksar Ceremonial Breastplate which although only
having 19ac has a 6pt a tic regen effect from level one which kicks ass as a
twink item. That was 6500pp.

I got Tolan's boots for her which have an right click Invigour effect after
lvl 45 for 1kpp, but may switch to peerless dragon horn (1.2k)  in the
meantime as I dislike the Tolan's plate look.

Arms, legs and neck are Chimp hearvested Rygorr. Face was a dirst cheap
silver mask of some useless effect but had 5ac and 25hp. Earings were 2ac
25mana 35hp earings which were 500pp a peice and hands are Silver Chitin
Hand Wraps for the haste - 2200pp.

Ranged was a single cam darkwood bow for 400pp, and 1hs was a some sword
that looks like a flat metal tree branch with 24/11 and 5 str and sta but
most importantly was only 3.0 weight - 250pp. Cracked Darkwood Sheild till
she can dual wield (100pp) and and a Nathsar Greatsword (?) for 2hs which is
only 30 delay - forget the damage.

Belt slot....hmmmn- smiters girdle again from memory 10ac +3 all stats for
800pp. Wrists are Bracer of Scavenging 9ac 5sta and 5dex(?) which was Gimp
aquired and a Heroes Bracer 9ac 10str +5poison/disease which went for 200pp
I beleieve.

All in all, I don't think I will need to upgrade much till level 45 or so,
by the time I wish to acquire a Tolans Bracer so I don't have to drop the
summoned arrows of my mage anymore. It's a fair kitting I imagine, Oh yeah -
some Velium Fire Wedding rings 6ac 65hp round out the kitting so my level 9
Rangette has just a shade less HP than my old level 30 Ranger pre Chimp
days.

Who says twinking is evil?

*grins evilly*

Gotta love the Bazaar, I had less than a hundred plat before the bazaar
opened and only 800pp worth of crap to sell as seed money ; )
