I didn't mention anything about 56+ spells, wtg reading comprehension.

If you think Mask of the HUNTER is rare, try getting mask of the stalker.
Form of the hunter is useless unless you're one of those weirdos that likes
wolf form.

I have Circle of Seasons banked and waiting, same for Succor, had banishment
but gave it to a 59 mage friend since he'll be making 60 a while before me
and it's only like 200pp last I checked in bazaar (and it's a craptastic
spell), almost bought PotG for 500, but I didn't since I have better uses
for the money and bank space, plus I have PotC from doing my earring that I
still have to wait to scribe anyways.
