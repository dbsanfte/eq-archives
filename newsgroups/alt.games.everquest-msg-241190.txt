Yet again, asking why this supposed 'community' lets people flame on
like 2 year olds throwing a tantrum yet makes the claim that they are
reasonable adults [with the exception of the real polite people on
list...] I really think that with a little polite behavior, the whole
tenor of the group would calm down a lot. There will always be trolls,
and spammers....but I think that if yo actually followed the faq
yourselves, it might show that the faq actally matters...

Somehow, I dont think degenerating into counting posts in history, 
casting aspersions on someones s#xual preferences, r@cial makeup, 
hobbies and habits is really on topic for anything except alt.flame

actually, i have a friend who is fairly visually impaired, and the 
program that helps him read and respond to email unfortunately defaults 
to caps=\ which sucks, but the group home he lives in wont pay for a new 
program as that one 'isnt broken'=( and wont take it as a donation. 
Still working on that though.

Hm, I can think of most of the quick to flame people fubarring this

Also pertains to not flaming, IMHO.

So, it will really kill people to let someone who is *not* jaded and
tired to put forth the primary polite request not to top post, with the
link to the FAQ instead of cutting loose with @sshatted behavior?
