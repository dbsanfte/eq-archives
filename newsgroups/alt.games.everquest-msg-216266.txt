My experience says LDoN mobs are easily pet-tanked at 65/normal -
we just pacify and pull 1-3 mobs and kill them :)

I disagree.  A 65 beastlord is preferred over the other 2.  65% is
close enough, and they offer excellent DPS, CC (by off-tanking and
pet tanking adds) as well as staking mana regen.

The best LDoN group I've ever seen in action was an all pet group.  Of
course, the best PoP xp group I've ever seen in action was an all pet
group.  The best pre-PoP xp group I've ever seen in action was also
an all pet group.  I see a theme here.
