You don't need to out-damage them.  Damage is cumlative, you know, every
little (or in the case of nukes, not so little) bit helps, and gets you
closer to the ideal situation of having your mob's HP drop faster than your
clerics' mana (or for you calc inclined dHP/dt > dM/dt ).

So it's even more important to add some nukes.  Not every guild as a few
hundred wizzies sitting around just waiting to go join a raid.  Having the
ability to throw a druid's nukes in, and heal, and buff.... that's just
sorta useful.

Sounds like you've made a good case for bring druids on raids in the current
form.
