I've got the new UI, and these things just broke for me, too.  I had an EQ
crash the other day, and since then, a lot of settings are messed up.  I've
got most things fixed, but when people post links in guildchat, instead of a
blue item name, I get in the normal chat color the item number and name, and
it is not clickable.  When I post a link, it shows up fine in the "You say"
message, and works.

In the Bazaar, in my regular chat window, the links do show up in blue, but
the number still shows up, sometimes in the blue, sometimes not, and the
link does not work.

Next time I'm on, I'll check the eqclient.ini file, and see if there is any
obvious corruption.
