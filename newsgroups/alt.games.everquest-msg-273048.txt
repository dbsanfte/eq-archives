...that I switched to WoW

Its much more FUN....

You EQ2 guys are missing out on some great PvE....

Imagine 40 people from Qeynos attacking Freeport and fighting their way
in... Thats WoW...

but enjoy your locked mobs and missing shards....

...I hope someday you awaken from the SoE brain washing like I did (after 6
years)
