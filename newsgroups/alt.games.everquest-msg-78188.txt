Hi Joe,

I must say that this program just keeps getting better all the time. I
do have one suggestion for the new skills section. Instead of
[Charname-Skills], you might want to use this format 
[Charname-Srv#-Skills]. This would guard against possible problems if an
account uses the same charname on two or more servers.
