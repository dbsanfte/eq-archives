    I purposely didn't link this to my server's general board, because it
mentions the high value of tradeskill drops from the elemental planes. Right
now my guild has been able to fleece the other guilds in the planes pretty
well on tradeskill drops - they seem to have no clue what is rare and what
is valuable. I've even been able to find out which vendors their looters
sell to after raids, and pick up things worth hundreds to thousands of plat
off vendors for 7 pp each. So no mentioning the tradeskill thing!

    But I did want to link it because I believe this is happening to one of
the other three "big guilds" on the server. There's a Bazaar mule that has
the droppables from certain restricted kills on it, and those droppables
always appear after a certain guild does a raid on that content. The items
are grossly overpriced, get slowly marked down, and disappear off the vendor
at about 50% markdown - at which point they hit playerauctions. The guild in
question is on DKPs, so a lot of stuff goes to their guild bank....
