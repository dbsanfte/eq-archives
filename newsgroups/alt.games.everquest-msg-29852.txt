	Um, no.

	First off, the fleeting quiver has 60% WR, not 66%.

	Second off, the WR is not the haste value.  That would be insane.  The
best figures we have so far suggest that the haste value is WR/3.  This means
a Tailored Quiver (22% WR) is good for about 7% haste, the Thunderhoof Quiver
(33% WR, which I use) is 11% and the Fleeting Quiver is 20%.

	The good news is that testing also shows that your quiver haste stacks
with your item and spell haste, and it can push you over the haste cap for
your level.

	And yes, the Fleeting Quiver is a bitch to make; last I heard it is not
trivial at Tailoring skill of 207.
