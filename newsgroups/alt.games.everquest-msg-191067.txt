Yeah, see, I gave away all my equipment the first time I left, and when 
I came back I had a really hard time getting back into it.  This time 
I'm smart - they never delete characters, thus, the stuff stays where it 
is until I inevitably get the twitches and come back.  Deleting the 
characters would be an even worse idea.  You'd just kick yourself all 
the harder when you caved.
