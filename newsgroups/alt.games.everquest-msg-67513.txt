I haven't yet bought the expansion, but was wondering if anyone else after
all the patching, weren't able to see the Vah Shir char model. Must you buy
the expansion to see the Vah Shir model? Would seem silly for all those that
haven't upgraded to only see a naked Human running around instead of the Vah
Shir body.
