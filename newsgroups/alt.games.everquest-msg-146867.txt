And I say again, it's not Alla's doing.

Which pretty much robs him of the money that funds his site where the
subscription income falls short. Most pop-up providers ONLY pay out
for ads that are fully downloaded to the viewer before being
cancelled.

Point is, you're attacking the wrong target. Find out who his ad
provider is and complain to THEM. And, yes, I do beleive that ANY
company that installs software on your computer without your
knowledge, much less your consent, should be shut down and fined out
the ass at the very least.
