I can equip a  twink pretty well just doing a bit of farming in my
favorite cash spot - my BL has about 70k worth of bazaar stuff on 
him, all financed by solo-2-boxing.  Equipping him better either requires
no-drop items or as much cash for single items as I've spent to date
on him.  I certainly haven't rolled on anything that I won't immediately
swap into my equipment.
