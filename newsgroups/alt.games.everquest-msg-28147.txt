Greetings everybody,

I am now using a ISDN connection to play Everquest. Did not have any major
problem, EQ is running fine. In a week or so I will get a new computer so my
wife can play too and I will want to share the dial-up connection. Does
anybody have any suggestion of what software I could use on the WinME box
with the ISDN modem ? I don't want to buy a router just yet, I am hoping I
can get away with some connection sharing software for now.

2 months ago I used to share my internet connection with a friend with
Wingate. It worked very nice but I am not sure how would Wingate work with
all these UDP ports that are needed for EQ. I will look into it but if
someone has a better solution I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks
