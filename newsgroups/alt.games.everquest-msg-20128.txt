I have an account for sale on Quellious server. It consists of a 34 bard, 24
druid, 17 warrior, and a few lesser newbie charactors. The Bard is fully
equiped with all Lambent and all things either at his level or above it. The
druid is clothed except for a few slots and the warrior is clothed for her
level also. The bard is the key charactor on the account having his DE
illusion mask, Tamborine, and all his songs to his level and some of the
higher ones in the bank.He also has all of the weight reduction packs except
the 100% ones. It has been since Velious came out that I played but the
account is capable of both expansions. Transfer of the account will not be
made until the money is in my hand via check or money order. Email me with
serious offers or questions. I will begin the bidding at $175.
