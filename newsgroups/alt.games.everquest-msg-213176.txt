Well its like this.. how far do you go to accomodate for the dumb people
that can't simply take their kids out of the car? And who pays for the what
you call *great upgrades*? Me? And are you willing to pay the extra $5 or 10
thousand dollars that it would cost to do this?

Why do we need to add features to a car when common sense should tell you to
just take the poor kid out of the car?

Seat belts are totally different.  The features you mentioned are to
compensate for human stupidy and lack of common sense.  Seat belts protect
you in accidents!
