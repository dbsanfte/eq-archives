Fighting near the entrance to Karnor's Castle last night
in the Dreadlands, the ranger, paladin, and myself that
were meleeing..._ALONG WITH THE DROLVARG_ we
were fighting were Gravity Fluxed, Knocked Back (from
the entrance of KC out into the dirt!!!), and had buffs
stripped by a storm.

That was pretty f'ing scary.
