Maybe. I do feel the letter was a slap in the face to people like bizbee 
and others who've recently been on the receiving end of their new 
customer service program.

our average telephone hold times are now 5 minutes or under. And our in-

/end quote

If that isn't self congratulatory, I don't know what is. And given that 
by many accounts the *effectiveness* of their customer service has  
declined in lockstep with the response times there is nothing to merit 
congratulation. Perhaps if he'd addressed this to his shareholders 
instead of his customers it would be better received. ;)
