Of course it is.  It's public to the workforce, not private
to the owner.

Not at all.  Mechanics keep their own tools in my experience.
They don't throw them all into one toolbox.

Right.  So, if she has a problem, she should either get
management involved (same as you would have in 1st
grade) or take ownership herself and secure it.   The
idea of opening oneself to a major felony prosecution
in exchange for someone's petty crime seems pretty
stupid to me.
