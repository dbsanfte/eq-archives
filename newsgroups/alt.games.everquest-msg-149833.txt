No, I agree, I just don't have as much experience on other classes.  I'm
certain cleric roots do work this way, pretty sure all druid roots too.

See, here I raise the possibility that another class's root exists that
doesn't work that way... but I'm looking for you to name that class.

Well thats really not important, if what you mean is "there are some
roots that are guaranteed to last 6 seconds, but break just as all
other roots do after that".  If you are saying there are fixed duration
roots you can rely on, though, then root parking becomes a far
more viable strategy, just as fixed duration invis is a far different
thing than normal invis/camo/ITU.
