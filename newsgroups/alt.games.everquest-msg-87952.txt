I started playing EQ when it first came out on a Pentium II 233 with 128MB
RAM, using a Diamond Viper V330 card. Now, I'm running on W2K on a Pentium
III 450 with 384MB RAM with no problems. I also have a Voodoo 3 card and
like the graphics performance I've been getting. I haven't seen a GeForce
card running EQ, but maybe it looks even better! I'm on a 768kbps DSL line
now, but I started on 56k dial-up (where I was actually connecting at around
42kbps)

There is plenty of both. Going to town is mostly for stocking up on needed
supplies, but there's plenty of merchants to "chat" with, there's NPCs who
will give you things and send you on quests, and there's a ton of safe
places to just sit and chat with other PCs as they happen by.

I stopped playing EQ for about 6 months last September (and just restarted
two days ago) because I was frustrated with how long it takes to level up so
you can get out to see the whole of Norrath. There was a lot of talk about
over-crowding and spawn camping then, but, as an example, last night I was
in Blackburrow for about 2 hours with only four other characters in the
entire dungeon. That can be good and bad. It's nice to get spawns when they
happen, but it can be a pain when you're dying and there's no one around to
scream to for help. I don't camp for stuff.. There's a lot of areas you
don't dare go at low levels because "here there be monsters" who will aggro
on you the moment you enter the zone. Admittedly I'm playing on what was one
of the first servers created (Veeshan) and maybe those early adopters, like
me, have stopped playing or moved to other servers, or whatever.

EQ is far and away the most addictive activity I've ever been engaged in
both on the computer and off (sad, huh?). I've never played any other game
that could match it. It's been just about three years since I started, and I
had friends who were early beta testers who turned me on to it even before
it was available in the stores. Aside from the recent, shall we say
sabbatical, I keep coming back to it.
