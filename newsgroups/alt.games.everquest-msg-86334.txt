I agree with you, I'm just trying to point out that as long as the trader
feature is inactive and you have to wait on the spires to fire to go to
Luclin, the bazaar is going to be unused, primarily because about 90% of the
TP capable people out there are druids and its far easier to get a port to
WC, run 2 minutes to EC and auction rather than porting to DL/NK/GD and
running to the spires, wait for up to 15 minutes to go to the moon, and then
sell stuff  (and then wait AGAIN to get back down)

The time investment in getting up there won't be as noticeable once the
trader feature is implemented though since you can just go to bed and still
be selling your stuff.
