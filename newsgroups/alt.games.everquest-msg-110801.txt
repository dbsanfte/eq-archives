Traveler's Boots.  Journeyman's Boots (JBoots) are insta-cast;
TBoots have a cast time.   Both increase your movement speed
by 35% and can only be cast in outdoor zones.  Both have the
can be used from inventory and have the same stats.  The *only*
differences are how you get them and the cast time.  TBoots cost a
bit over 5K with max faction/charisma and are sold by the Gnomes
in SolA.  JBoots are gotten via a quest.

JBoots are better because you can refresh them on the run
when the effect wears off or is dispelled.  You have to stop to
cast TBoots.  TBoots are still a viable alternative as long as
you're careful about making sure the effect doesn't drop and
you don't fight mobs that can dispel.
