No, its not that I pull things from all over. It's that we, as different
people, look at things in a different angle. This is the point where
questioning and clarification come into play.

I have yet to get pissed at all.  You don't know me, nor have you taken the
time to get to know me before making a statement about my emotional state.
I get frustrated when other's feel that they understand me without taking
the time to know me.  Frustrated is not pissed.  I fyou don't believe that
one, just talk to my kids.

No, I try to state things concisely, giving respect for those with slower
modems and less RAM.  If they would like clarification, I will expand and
provide examples behind my reasoning.  I try very hard not to be ambiguous.
I have also stated many times that I feel the proper response to something
which you do not fully understand is not to complain, or insult, but to ask
questions and have things clarified.  Perhaps you might also find that this
is a much more productive form of communication.

I'd make a comment here, much like you, about the difference between words
and actions, but since it would most likely fall on deaf ears, I won't.
