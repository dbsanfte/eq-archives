Here's the new patch message for today's patch.  Some
nice changes (the Alt-labels, /safelock), an intriguing
one (I wonder what Runnyeye is like now), and a mixed
blessing (the Sewing Kit alteration).  But I'm confused,
what change might have risked deleting corpses, like
they've been warning about for two weeks now?

*** Message about our Guide Program ***


Hail citizens of Norrath!

Hear my words, for I bring news of great importance.

Today I present to you an adventure, perhaps the greatest the Lands 
of Norrath have ever offered.  It is a quest of great proportions, and 
a journey fraught with danger.  Fear not though my friends, for the 
spiritual rewards of this journey far outweigh any hardship involved.

As of now, we are once again gathering an adventuring party to protect 
and serve the lands of Norrath.  Scribes are lining up even now so that 
they may take your application to become a Guide of Norrath.

We are seeking those strong in character, bright in wit, soft with 
compassion, and filled with joy.

If you've ever felt good helping a fellow adventurer retrieve his corpse, 
or with helping someone when they felt all was lost, then this is truly 
the adventure for you.  Or perhaps you feel your sense of humor could 
bring smiles to the faces of Norrathian citizens.  Maybe your renowned 
acting skills might be of help.  If you are kind, compassionate, and 
helpful, then look no further for the rewarding journey you've sought.

If you are accepted, I will not mislead you, the journey will be 
difficult at times.  You can be assured that you will be tried...  
and hopefully you will be found true.  In the end though, the citizens 
of Norrath will benefit from your thoughtful participation, and the 
lands of Norrath will continue to become a better place.

If you feel this is something you must be a part of, then I invite 
you to point your browser to: http://guideapp.everquest.com

We ask so little of your time, but the benefits you can bring to 
Norrath are grand.

A few things to remember:
1) You must have an active EverQuest account in good standing.
2) You must be 18 years of age, or older.
3) Your account cannot be shared with any other individual.
4) You will need good communication skills.
5) Positive attitudes lead to positive results.
6) Ability to participate as a part of team is a must.


Come one, come all... help us to make the lands of Norrath better 
than they already are... come be a part of the EverQuest Guide 
Program!

*** Important Reminder ***

Due to some of the things we are going to be doing, there is a small 
chance that some corpses might disappear during the patch.  GMs will 
have the ability to verify any corpses that are lost.  That means that 
they can help you get them back if you do indeed lose one.  It is also 
important to understand that attempting to scam a GM about a lost 
corpse could mean banning from EverQuest.

** IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU PETITION TO HAVE A MISSING CORPSE PROBLEM 
ADDRESSED WITHIN 5 DAYS OF THE PATCH! **

We will not be recovering corpses that might be lost after that time.  
In fact, it would be best for you to petition immediately if you have a 
problem.  Don't wait.  If you are worried about a corpse that you were 
unable to deal with before the patch, then please log in and check on it 
right away after the patch.

So please make certain that you have as many of your corpses cleaned 
up as possible before the next patch.  We're not expecting a lot of 
corpses to disappear, but the fewer lying around, the less chance of 
them disappearing.

Thanks.

*** Patch Message ***


** Zone Changes **

- Runnyeye has been changed.  Something is up in Goblin land...


** Spell and Song Changes and Bug Fixes **

- We've been fixing holes in the spell stacking code.  For the most 
part the changes fix bugs that allowed tricks to get spells to 
stack that were never intended to stack.

- Increased duration on Bard Charm songs to 18 seconds from 12 seconds.

- Fixed the Spell Scroll for Imbue Amber so that Erudite Clerics of 
Cazic Thule can scribe it.

- The casting messages for Necromancer pet summoning spells have been 
changed to be more appropriate.



** Features and Interface Changes **

- The variable %t will now work with /assist.  So you can use /assist %t 
if you wish.  Though it should have exactly the same effect as /assist 
without the %t.

- %r returns "corpse" for corpses and "NPC" for targeted NPCs.

- Sense traps failure message text color has been changed to 
user color 15 (same as other skill messages).  The success message 
was already set to user color 15.

- Ignore Lists now work the same way that the Friends List does.  
It has been expanded to 30 names per character per server.  The new 
ignore list is stored in the same ini file as the friends list 
(<character name>_<#>.ini).  The first time a character is created or 
loaded after the patch their new ignore list will be a copy of the old 
ignore list, but will from then on be unique to the character.

- The Alt key now works in several new situations.  It will now show 
item names when in the trade window.  Because the trade items of the 
local player and the trading partner are so close together, the item 
names of the trading partner will always show up unless the player 
positions their mouse pointer over the local player part of the trade 
window, which will cause the game to only show the local player's trade 
item names.

- The Alt key will show item names for items in your bank.

- The Alt key will also pop up names for merchant items and corpse 
items when you hold it down in merchant mode or loot mode.

- The Alt key will even pop up names for items in open containers when 
held down and the mouse cursor is over the open container window (they 
don't show up otherwise).

- The client will now automatically reject a /duel request from any 
player that is on your /ignore list.  Some players were using this 
to annoy players that had ignored them.

- You also will no longer see /consent messages from people that are 
on your /ignore list (this was also something people were doing to 
annoy people that had ignored them).

- /who GUILD (and the GUILD must be in caps) will now show you the 
members of your guild in your zone.  You can also specify a guild name, 
such as /who "Irontoe Brigade".

- /safelock command added.  /safelock will lock the EverQuest interface 
(mostly just mouse clicks, keyboard commands/movement, and most slash 
commands) with the password that you supply to the command.  You must use 
this command a second time, supplying the same password, to unlock the 
interface.  Passwords are NOT case-sensitive.  So to lock your interface, 
you would type /safelock password.  You would do the same to unlock it.  
REMEMBER:  If you forget what password you typed, you will need to 
reboot your machine.


** Item Changes **

- All the shields in the game that have the Ribcage graphic should now 
also have the ribcage icon when they are in your inventory.

- Tinkered Watchman helm should show up now.

- Ring of Pureblood is now equipable only on your fingers instead of 
your waist.

- Grand Master's Leg Wraps and Fists of the Grand Master are now No-Drop.  
They were intended to be No-Drop when they were created. 

- Peacekeeper Staff and the Bug Collection box are no longer equipable.  
There are problems that can arise when containers can be equipped, so 
we had to disable that for these items.

- Sewing Kits:  No existing sewing kits are being changed with this 
patch.  But from now on, kits sold on vendors will be somewhat different.  
Large Sewing Kits will have 8 slots.  Deluxe Sewing Kits will have 10 
slots and weight slightly more than the Large Sewing Kit.

- Changed the color of the Kael SK quest armor from a very pretty 
blue-green to a more appropriate reddish-gray.


**  Other Stuff **

- Changed the spelling of Troubador to Troubadour for the 55th level 
bard title.  :)

- King Tormax's spawn rate has been adjusted to be more in line with 
that of his counterparts in Velious.  This is not the sort of thing 
that we will usually announce, as spawn times and things of that 
nature are part of the dynamic content of EverQuest.  We're 
announcing this, however, to help avoid some confusion.
