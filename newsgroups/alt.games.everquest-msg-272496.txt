Sony/Verant are complete idiots.

I guess they think people enjoy sitting for hours waiting for a KEI to show 
up.  I refuse to play this game without it.  The least they could do is 
allow people to make KEI potions and sell them, or put a NPC in the game 
that gives out KEI.

But then again Sony/Verant never has cared about the customer.... thats why 
they have such a poor rating for EQ2 on Amazon.com and World Of Warcraft has 
much better reviews.  People are sick of Sony/Verant.
