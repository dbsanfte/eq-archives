... given SOE's track record with EQ and SWG, I'd say the odds of that
ever happening are pretty much zero. My main reason for trying WoW
first and giving EQ2 a few months before I (maybe) try was the SWG
release. If they managed to fuck things up that badly at a time when
they weren't racing Blizzard to be first out the door, I have
absolutely no faith that EQ2 will be anything but a beta release when
it comes out.

Nowhere is it written that you have to buy a game on the day that it's
released <g>.
