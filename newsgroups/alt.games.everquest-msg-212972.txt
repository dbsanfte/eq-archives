Yes, by making the rains no longer land on mobs that were low on HP... 100%
resist meant that the rains didn't kill the mobs, so the mobs weren't dying to
"unattributed damage" so they didn't poof.

Or so I understand it, I personally find rains to be silly and useless in most
circumstances, this little extra boost to their theoretical damage output isn't
going to change that for me.

And I don't get the "unattributed damage" angle, either, since DS is
"unattributed damage" but mobs that die from DS don't poof as long as someone
did at least one point of damage to them.  Are they saying that not only did
the rain caster have to die, but his rain had to be the only thing damaging the
mob?  Or did they code rain (and I hear DOTs worked the same way) differently
than DS, so there's more than one kind of "unattributed" damage?

A mess any way you look at it.
