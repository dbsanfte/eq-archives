I see, "I need to top post because heaven forbid my pearls of wisdom
get lost in a thread and just become one of a number of other
responses..."

Most annoying to finish a thread only to see another response sitting
at the bottom of the list. I make it a point to kill all top post
threads. There are always going to be people who refuse to follow
convention, so I don't bitch at them, I just toss the posting and kill
the thread.
