I think so, yes.  Have they dropped the trivial from 50/51 to 37 yet?  If
not, then 20% failure is very much to be expected; if they've dropped it to
37, you sh ould still expect about a 10% failure rate, 20% can't be *too*
unusual.  The "more trivial" something is, the less you'll fail at it--but
still, you'll always have failures thanks to the RNG (random number
generator, which determines fails, successes and skill ups).  I've got a 206
level baker who still fails at making clumps of dough about 3% of the time.
The fact it's trivial doesn't certify a certain success/failure rate, it
only hedges your bets against the RNG.

If you've got the plat, spend a few hours doing rings, folded sheets,
lanter, fillet knives, frying pans, whatever will get you to about 50 points
ahead of the trivial of what you're trying to make.  That, plus the geerlock
should put you in good shape and reduce your failure rate somewhat.
