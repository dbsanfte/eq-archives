I don't see how.  Most outdoor terrain, including buildings and
walls, doesn't seem to interfere with spell casting.  I'm pretty
sure this is to <prevent> LOS exploits by players fighting caster
mobs.  If you ever go to JP to fight the Darkpaw Gnolls there and
you're not strong enough to fight inside the tunnels (adds can be
a real problem if solo or in a weak group), you'll find it a real
treat to pull the necro casters outside, the mob will stand in
the tunnel and dump all its mana casting on you through 60 feet
of "solid" earth/rock before it finally comes running out to be
killed.  Of course it does work both ways, you can cast right
back at it all the while (I generally cast a few Cancel Magics to
strip the DS off them, and a high poison resist is very handy
to minimize damage taken while pulling).
