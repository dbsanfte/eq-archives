Depends how good your clerics are.  Anyway, I doubt a warrior would ever be
second on the agro list (at that level of the game you surely know better)

Umm thats completly wrong.  If i whirlwind (riposte) or /disc voidance, I
will INSTANTLY lose agro on AoW (on any mob, for that).  He will smack
whoever else was next on the agro list, and then when the disc ends, he will
come back and smack me.

No ifs no buts.

Also, monks have no escape on an AoW wipe/agro.  AoW is a mob you just can't
feign off when hes damaged.  Him and Vindi are 2 mobs that just aren't ever
fooled for some majorly annoying reason :(
