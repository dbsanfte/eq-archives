Every Charakter who hasnt maxed defence should start maxing that soon.
So I would say from defence all intcaster are on same level.

Ranking of those is difficult:

Enchanter have their Rune that provides something like double their HP.
Necromancer can Lifetap to heal themself.

I would put them both on position 1 and 2 ;)

Wizard on 3 as they have 600 more HP due to their Epic.

Mages have nothing to protect themself, so place 4 for them.
