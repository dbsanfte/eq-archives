I've done something similar as an enchanter, but only with three mobs at a
time, and I didn't consider it kiting as I didn't move much. Charm mob, get
him beat on by two others. AE mez at pet 10%, pillage my pet, nuke him, pull
another, let them beat on him some more. Root was my friend.

Once when really daring and carrying lots of hp buffs from some nice passing
group, I was doing this with 3 non charmies. The charmies go down very fast
that way. Keep DS on your pet and nuke the pet killers when they get low
too.


I did an agro kiting group as the agroee... pull, mez, tash tash tash slow
slow cripple get someone to snare, dot and let it chase me while the
non-taunting pet's follow it beating on it.
