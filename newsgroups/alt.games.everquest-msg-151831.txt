Max hit damage primary hand = (wep_dmg * 2) + wep_dmg_bonus.
Max hit damage secondary hand =  (wep_dmg * 2)

So a 11/29 wep with bonus 8 would (atmost) do (2*11)+8 = 30, while offhand
with same wep would be 22.

There are various damage caps that prevent achieving this number that are
level based. This keeps low level folks from grabbing some uber wep and
killing everything in sight.
