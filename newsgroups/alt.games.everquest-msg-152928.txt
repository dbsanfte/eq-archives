}Yes there is a limit.  Your first idea was probably thought of by Verant &
}done to prevent AFK gaming or other type of acts.

Any idea what the limit is?  My guess would be 32768ish, which should be 
about 53 minutes, give or take.

}Your second idea would
}work assuming someone made the proper setup for it.  Problem might be
}getting the weight to fall off of the key almost immediately.  Maybe a ramp
}type of setup may work with the top of the ramp on the key, that way the
}object falls onto it & bounces or rolls off.

Yeh, hmm.  Cut a rubber hose in half, mount one end just above the relevant 
key and attach the other end to the arm of the beam balance, and block the 
scale end.  When the beaker balances the weights, the hose should begin to 
slope downward enough that a superball will roll down it...  

Or you could get a clock with relatively big hands, break the faceplate on 
it, and sharpen the the hourhand so it will cut through a thread at the right 
time that drops a superball on the key, suspended from a pulley on the 
ceiling.  Need fairly weak thread, and a strong clock motor...

You might also do well to cover the rest of the keyboard so the ball doesn't 
bounce on your /sit off key or something.

Actually, can you set the VCR-like program to automatically set itself up 
ready to go when windows boots?  Then you could just use one of those plug 
timers that turn on the lights when you're on vacation to reboot the computer 
by interrupting the power.  VCR program starts automatically, and EQ... 
doesn't.

}    I do like that you came up with an idea that would work though has
}NOTHING to do with EQ, software, or Windows...and therefore is more likely
}not to fail due to software glitch.

Yep.  Think outside the Windows box. :)
