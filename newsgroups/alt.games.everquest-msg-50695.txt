Wilton literally spawns every time my druid is not looking for him to
spawn. Its kind of the watched kettle thing. One night I ran around
kill the ac spawns since no one was camping it, killed the oracle once
since no one was camping it (nice robe for the POD), saw wilton out of
corner of eye while killing a clops and snared him right away to get
the thingie, got the ac ring in like 3 more spawns and the following
day saw wilton up again but still had the lore thing on me and I
killed him and shouted to the zone it was there and no one responded
or came.

I see him pop up a lot while doing that or being bored there and just
turning in erolsi bracer and pirate earrings to styria fearnon (wood
elf sister lady) for elf faction raises. Usually I see wilton up a
least once doing that for about an hour. So I'd hang out there and do
other stuff and just keep an eye out.
