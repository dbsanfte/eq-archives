Not just self-twinking, though of course that's one use.  I actually
treat my two "active" characters as fairly independent except that they
sort of help each other out.  E.g., one is a brewer and makes sauces
that the other uses for baking.  (And the baker has sow and gate, so
she can fetch ingredients for the brewer.)

People who leave traders up in the Bazaar can use the shared bank to
hand things through from their active characters to be sold, and to
get the money back.  (The bazaar mule can also shop the bazaar for
stuff the active characters want.)

I even have a couple characters who are mostly confined to the banks
in their starting cities.  Their job is to use their non-shared bank
space to store stuff that I expect to need later.  E.g., there are
several quests that my Iksar plans to repeat a LOT to work on his
factions, but I'm not ready to try them yet.  So I use my "banker"
characters to store the items I'll need.

And, as was mentioned elsewhere in the thread on "corpse-banking",
you can pass Lore items through the shared bank and thereby keep
multiple copies around.  E.g., if you're a druid and want to do the
Xanthe's Earring quest twice, turning one of the earrings in for an
Earring of the Solstice, you can make one earring, store it in the
shared slot, then make the second and head off to convert it.  I
also pass Lore items through to store them for later sale in the
bazaar.
