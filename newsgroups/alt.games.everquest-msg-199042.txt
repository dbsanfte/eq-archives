On what basis do you make that claim?  Please explain your reading
of his post to me.  Don't forget to treat the post as if it were
directed at you, as if you had taken the position that KEI is
unnecessary and dependence on it, especially at low level, is
indicative of poor play.

> Did you take it as insulting?  Yes.
> Would everyone take it as insulting?  Obviously that's a big no. 


That has not been demonstrated, as the post was not directed at those
who assert that it is not.  One thing my children have been doing a
very good job of teaching me is that youngsters have a terrible time
actually putting themselves in somebody else's shoes.

Nah, my insults are direct and honest.  Clydefrog tried to be
dishonest about it, and I'm not buying it.

Um, sure.  Whatever you say.

One last try.  Please explain this substance to me.  I've done
you the courtesy of clarifying my argument, you reply with vague
generalities that say absolutely nothing.
If, to paraphrase, "Kaev is rude because I say he's rude, while
Clydefrog is not because I say he isn't" is the best you can do,
well I guess that needs no further comment.  Likewise, the bare
and general assertion that you "see substance in what anyone says"
is in no way relevant to my request that you specify the substance
of your argument that Clydefrog's comment was not insulting.  As
it is, your evasions and insults in reply to my request lead me to
conclude that there is no such substance.
