How does this work? For example, if you had say 5 clerics and you are number
5 in the order of casting would you med and wait untill you see that Cleric
4 has begun casting (I assume via the standard 'casting heal on %t' call)
then begin casting complete heal yourself? Would this not aggro the mob to
the clerics? On a similar vein in a raid with more than 6 people would what
channel would I use to call my heals (/ooc i guess?). Ahh - so many
questions!
