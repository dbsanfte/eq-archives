An obscure name from fantasy would be copyrighted, however, one of the
rules plainly states only easily recognized names from fantasy are in
violation.

No, the rules are not clean-cut. NOWHERE does it say this. They have
ALWAYS been open to GM interpretation. Yes, there are names that
clearly violate the rules, names that cannot be interpreted in any way
to fall within those rules. But there are others that are
questionable. The naming guidelines are just that, guidelines. They're
flexible. To an extent.

It, really, it doesn't matter how many times you repeat "Either the
name is trademarked/copyrighted or it isn't", it's not going to alter
the way the rules are handled.

Lokari is a brand name, true. Is it reasonable to assume she didn't
know this? Yes. Is it likely more than a tiny handful of people will
recognize it? No. Is it vulgar or otherwise openly offensive? No. Then
it's fine.
