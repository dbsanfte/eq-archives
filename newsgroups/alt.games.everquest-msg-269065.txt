Some things decay over time.

PP and Tribute and Food in EQ1 get spent and must reacquired and nobody 
has ever blinked about that.

So too does fame and prestige. You must stay in the headlines to stay a 
headliner.

I think it may have needed some tuning (farming greys being a good 
example... obviously if you can earn fame doing trivial conquests you 
should be able to earn it doing more relevant and challenging 
conquests), but getting rid of decay altogether is stupid. Looks like 
Sony is already backing away from sensible design models to cater to 
whining. 

EQ2s golden age of 'vision' ends less than a month after release. :p

Too bad the real world doesn't work like that... you can bet your ass 
those 80s/90s has-been rock/pop stars would love to still be famous...
