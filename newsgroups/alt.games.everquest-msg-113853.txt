I would like the answer to this myself.  On my board - Tholuxe Paells - last
night there was a guy selling a Lammy for 3KP.  I paid 2 KP for my Centi
Longsword - the going rate.  Would it be beneficial to switch?  
FWIW, I usually play with my wizard partner so I am the ONLY tank... My primary
weapon is a Wurmslayer.  Or maybe I should use the Centi with the Lammy and
sell the Wurmslayer... ???
