It strikes me as extremely (or should I say "pathetically"?) obvious.  As
far as its not being Yantis's style... well, suppose this guy goes to Yantis
and says, "Pay me such-and-such an amount and I'll boost your sales by 20%."
Yantis thinks about it and says, "Ok, but if my sales don't go up you don't
get shit."  The guy says, "Ok, sure, I'll go for that," and runs around
usenet groups making thinly disguised ads for Yantis.  The resulting spam is
not really Yantis's style but then it's not his work either, all he knows is
that BigBoy is getting him buyers.  If you're claiming it's not Yantis's
style to hire amateur internet advertisers... bullshit.  That's everybody
and their mama's style.  As annoying as spam is, you think the guy's going
to pass on incredibly cheap and fairly successful advertising, just because
it's "not his style"??  And you have to admit, annoying and moronic as this
BigBoy guy seems, he's a lot better at his sales pitching than most
spammers.
