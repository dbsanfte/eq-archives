The trick to the garg island in OOT is let the gargs roam around for a
while.  If you ever show up at the island when no one else is around
and its full of gargs that have been there for a long time, almost
every garg has an eye or two, but then after you kill them and they
repop, they hardly ever drop eyes.  At least this how it appeared to
me when I used to do the garg island.
