Well I guess they improved the balance when they nerfed HoH drops, but
that really does nothing for most folks.  Its still very easy to get
spectrals in HoH, and its still very hard to get them outside of HoH.
And not easy/hard as in requires skill, but in terms of time commitment.
There are a handful of spots outside HoH where a spectral parchment
*could* drop.  But none of them come close to the actual drop rate of
camps inside HoH.

I highly doubt Verant has any idea what is actually dropping spectral
parchments and at what rate because the drop rate, and list of mobs that
drop them, does not make sense.  And its really not comparable to the
Kunark situation.

First, 1/2 of the new spells were on a vendor in Kunark, all the way to
the top.  In PoP, perhaps 5% are are on a vendor.

Second, Kunark did not require any special 'effort' to get spells, and
neither does PoP.  Kunark required Verant to fix the drops for people to
get a reasonable shot at spells.  There were no magic spots for 51-54
drops in Kunark like the PoJ basement was/is for PoP.  And doing the
basement doesnt require effort, just persistence in getting the camp and
then holding it.

Third, even before Verant fixed the drops you could get spells up to
level 57 off of common mobs in Skyfire, they were just rare.  But they
didnt require uber guild membership or the player to have to jump
through the hoops of getting 'flagged' to get them.  You just had to
hunt there.  And hunt and hunt and hunt.

59/60 spells were hard to get, unless you got in on the Chottal gravy
train before he was nerfed.  But again, *some* of these spells were on
vendors.

Well my beef is mostly with spectral parchments.  It is wrong that the
drop rate, even adjusted, be so high in HoH and so low outside of there.
I mean, I think its stupid that windblades were ever that common, but
its not surprising given Verant.  But still you'd think they'd recognize
that putting a weapon better than some classes epics as an almost common
drop off mobs that can be solod easily was a bad idea.

Its a lot easier to buy a girdle from HoH than a Bone Clasped, or maybe
I misunderstood you.  Badass is subjective, but name a belt thats easier
to get (if you are flagged for HoH that is) with better stats.  You
cant.

Should an item that is better than an epic be a common drop off a mob
that can be soloed?  Of course not and you know that.  You are defending
HoH simply because you have access to it.
