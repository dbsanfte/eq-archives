Ahh! MORE people need to ring this message home!!  These mothers (bitches)
hate Israel kids more than they love thier OWN kids!!!  I used to think
that it was "human nature" for any mother to automatically "love" their
kids - in fact, used to be an "ugly" joke like that: got a face only a
mother could love.  But know what? Pali bitch moms even defie *that*.
They *hate* their kids, are selfish, and bitter to the terrorist that
knoocked them up in the first place.  If they were so "loving", they
THEMSELVES would blow themselves up in hopes of paving the way for their
offspring, no ??  Growing up, most parents would put THEIR lives on the
line to protect us kids.  (of course there *is* that time the old man
sent me up the street for smokes in that 1964 Ford bomb when I was 16)  :)
