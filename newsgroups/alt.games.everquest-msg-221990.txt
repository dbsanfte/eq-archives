    The best sarcastic comment I saw after it was announced there'd be no
GMs due to the fires: "So the fires have been burning for four years?" I'm
amazed that they've actually been able to get some GMs online.

    The headquarters where they all work is in the evacuation area. I wish
them all the best of luck - my home province was hit hard by fires this
summer, and it's just devastating to the people that are affected. I was
quite moved by one brief clip on our news over the summer, where a little
girl told the reporter in a sad voice, "The fire burned all my toys."
