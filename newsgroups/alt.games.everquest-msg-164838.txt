BULLSHIT.  My gnome magician fell in because some graphics lag hit due to a stinking party
near the pool with a bard and others casting.  missed the turn and landed in the pool.
Could NOT get out.  Petition went unanswered.  Nobody would levitate me to help me out.
Finally had to gate back to SK and make the goddamned run back to the spires.
