Yeh.  It would be nice if they did something to keep lower level characters
from getting high on KEI.  I would not be so much against this spell if
there was something comparable for the tanking classes like a Warrior or
Monk.  If they would create a buff that increased my HP pool by 250 points,
increased my HP regeneration by 14 points per tick, increased my STA by 25
and STR by 25 and would last as long as KEI then I would be satisfied.  As a
Bar Warrior with a STA of 134, if my HP get down to 80% after a fight, it
takes over five minutes of sitting just to get them back to 100%.
