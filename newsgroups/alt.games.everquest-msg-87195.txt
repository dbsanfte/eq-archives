I fail to see how having a larger repitore than you currently do takes away
the need to think.  If you really want a challenge, just use one spell slot,
and re-mem each time you need to use a different one.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
