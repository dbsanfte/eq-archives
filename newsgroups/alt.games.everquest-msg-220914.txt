My experience at lower levels is that fire pets were too fragile
to MA, and their DS didn't do anything if they weren't MA.  I'll
be delighted if I find that with plate armor and a torch they do
live long enough to be usable; finding mobs that hit a lot for
small damage each time (Lightcrawlers, I suppose?) would be a big
help of course.

I disagree; you can't rely on it for caster interrupt, certainly,
but that wasn't on my list of why I like Air pets.  Slow (because
during stun intervals the mob isn't hitting, so it hits fewer
times over the run of the fight) Snare (because it isn't running
when its stunned, which means it doesn't cover as much distance
while fleeing... or isn't so good at catching up with me when I'm
running away)  and taunt, because Stun is a pretty good hate
producer as any paladin can explain.  It does all those jobs
whether its MA or not, and the effect stacks with everyone else
doing the same jobs; stacks with real slow, stacks with real
snare, even stacks with real aggro control since it doesn't
interfere with the MA doing his thing but if it does generate
more hate than the MA had, the MA increases his hate to That
level on his next successful taunt. It even stacks very nicely
with more air pets Is it godlike at any of these things?  No, not
even if you go full bore and give the little guy two gnoll hide
lariats to boost his stun output.  But its not bad, and I'm
always torn between air and water in a group situation because of
that.

Someone else suggested that adding AC means the mobs hit just as
often but for less damage per hit.  This would be a dream for any
DS strategy, and especially for fire pets, perhaps making them
viable.

Can you describe any situation or tactic where this is a useful
thing?  Nothing occurs to me at the moment, but I haven't thought
about it much.

Splendid
