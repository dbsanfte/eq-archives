EQPlayNice is a program that fixes what EQ Programmers are lazy to enter 
into sourcecode (someone once said AFAIK one 5 character command at the end 
of code missing).

Anyways EQPlayNice is a program you run before EQ, and needs to be updated 
at every patch day. Can't say it keeps CPU power lower than 100% as before, 
but surely makes other programs get a piece of the pie, so they can run too 
at a very acceptable speed.
