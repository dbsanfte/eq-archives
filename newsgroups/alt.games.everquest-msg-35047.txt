Picture the mob on the end of an invisible string. I'm not a caster type but
I have seen many people do this and it is a thing to behold when done
properly. Basically, it goes something like this:
You Root or Ensnare the mob, then Damage over Time (DoT), then a Direct
Damage (Nuke), meditate to recoup mana, rinse, repeat.

While you are doing this, you walk backwards away from the mob, thus the
image of flying a kite.
There is also a "reverse-kite" that some people refer to which involves Fear
type spells on the mob. In this case, you are chasing the mob as it runs.

Then there is double and triple and quad kiting...

Hope that helps.
